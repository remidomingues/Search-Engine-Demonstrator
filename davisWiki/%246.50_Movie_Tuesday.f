Every Tuesday both Regal Cinemas Davis Stadium 5 and Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 show SELECT Movies movies for the fantastic price of $6.50 all day (no student or matinee discount on top of that).  Recently released movies (within the first two weeks of their release) dont qualify, and every so often there are no $6.50 movies available.  Movies become eligible for the Tuesday discount on the third week of their release.  Or earlier if the distributor is coooooool

The Varsity Theater also offers a discount on Tuesdays, to $8.50 (or $8 with their cash discount), which is still cheaper than any Davis theaters nonTuesday price.

Some remember, when the wiki was 2004 young, this page started out as $4 Movie Tuesday. Regal, however, has steadily raised the price by a quarter every once in a while. This is usually greeted with outrage. However, the $4 price used to only apply to matinees, whereas now the discount price applies to the entire day!

The 6.50 Tuesday selection can be found by checking  http://www.fandango.com Fandango (Select the day in question (a Tuesday) and select the exact movie time to check the price and see if it is $6.50) or the newspaper. Calling the theater is not advised.
  However, when I called this number, the girl on the phone said to call Fandango and they would tell me the movies and times. Users/VivianPham
  When I worked there it was made clear that they do not even answer the phones on Tuesday because they get busy, so dont bother.   Users/AllisonEriksen
 Use the rule above to determine if it is on Tuesday discount OR look at Tuesdays newspaper (if there is a star next to the title or it says no passes, it will   be full price) OR follow the Fandango directions. Users/Shannon.F

In February 2014, the $5.50 Movie Tuesday increased to $6.50 for those not in possession of a Regal Crown Card.

Also remember that you get a small popcorn for $2 every Tuesday by presenting your Regal Crown Club Card at the box office.


20060721 09:01:25 nbsp The last two times I have gone to see a $4 movie in the evening they have been packed...I recommend getting to the theater at least a half an hour before Users/ShaunaMcKellar

20070526 09:51:19 nbsp I went to two movies last Tuesday evening, each of which had been out for three to four weeks. The first movie had one other person in the theater; the second had maybe twenty. Both movies were popular when they first came out, but maybe enthusiasm had died down by the time I went.  Users/ElleWeber

20071110 19:38:54 nbsp Price change to $4.25 is lame.  $4 Movie Tuesday! >.<  Users/EdWins

20071119 19:12:36 nbsp Agree with EdWins! Gimme back the $4 movies!! Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20071119 21:20:08 nbsp When I left Davis and saw the price of movies elsewhere, I suddenly realized that I wasnt in Davis anymore. Have you ever heard of a matinee at $8.50? Yes, thats SF for you. $4.25 for movies is still cheaper than most of the movie theaters in the entire state. Davis theaters are like the Taj Mahal compared to some of the dumpy theaters in other cities. And you dont have to worry about other theater patrons pulling out a gun...Users/Jedron
   This is purely dependent on the theater you go to. There are plenty of very nice (much nicer than Davis) theaters in SF. Same thing in most Bay Area cities. Users/KellyM
    And there are even nicer theaters outside of the Bay Area.  New York and Florida have theaters with overstuffed sofas, nice coffee tables, waiters... and $20+ tickets.  There are also some hideous dumps in all three places (Bay Area, New York and Florida).  The point Jedron is making is still valid regardless of any of that: its Jedrons opinion that, for value, Davis strikes a great balance.    jw
    I dont think its the city thats subsidizing our movie tickets. Im pretty sure its just the Regal chain using a promotion. Users/KellyM

20071124 02:17:32 nbsp This is the first time the Tuesday price has been raised in over 10 years!  Also the theatres in Davis are two of a very select few that even offer a discount night anymore.   Users/Shannon.F

20091103 01:22:49 nbsp I love going to the movies on Tuesday early afternoons. It recharges me. $1 popcorn. Silly movies or crymeariver dramas. Is it Tuesday yet? Users/robinlaughlin

20121127 13:25:24 nbsp Update: $5.50 :( Users/DanVillarreal

20140204 10:49:56 nbsp Looks like the prices went up again... The Fandango website says tickets are $6.50. Users/AngusEubangus

20140604 01:25:22 nbsp It is still $5.50 if you have a Regal Crown Card.  Users/JenniferNguyen
