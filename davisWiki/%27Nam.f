Nam is part of the dry Putah Creek channel between Highway 113 and the Arboretum located next to the Equestrian Center at the end of Old Davis Road.  It is the ROTC paintball field, as well as a popular place for airsoft and Marijuana reefer.  Its an awesome place, with awesome (sometimes high) people who hang out there.
