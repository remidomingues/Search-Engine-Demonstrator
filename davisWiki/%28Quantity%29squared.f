(quantity)^2^ is an entertaining comic drawn by Katherine Harnack Katherine Harnack, and published in the California Aggie during the 200506 and 200607 school years.

About:
The name comes from the term used in mathematics to describe when everything inside a set of parentheses is squared.  It is also a play on words, where the characters and jokes in the comic are square. Miss Harnack is a selfproclaimed nerd and member of Davis Anime Club. Like any other comic artist for the Aggie, she does appreciate any email from those who enjoy her comic. Her comics, as well as other art, can be found on her deviantART page http://kathyvicki.deviantart.com/ here.  A compilation of her comics is available for sale at the UC Davis Bookstore.

Characters:
  Cowlick: The typical UC Davis student, apparently his real name. He is currently in possession of a VCard.
  1Up: A typical video game nerd whose real name is John Hochburg. He too is currently in possession of a VCard.
  Demi: The serious academic archetype character. VCard status is unknown.
  Stoic: A play on words, this character is sheerly unshakable. VCard status is unknown, and given her unreadable nature, may never be known.
  Seamus: An Irish exchange student. To help indicate the accent, Seamus speech bubbles contain a different font, and the spelling follows European English rules, i.e: honour.
  Blake the Freshman: A lost and patheticlooking freshman. Since UC Davis accepted far more students than it has beds for in 2006, Blake is living in a very crowded dorm.
  Lissa: 1Ups older sister. She is a foxy version of him, but with more social skills.
  Stan: Lissas fianc√© and a lvl 12 Ranger.
  The Nameless Professor: A professor that the gang seems to have regardless of what the course is.
  Nudist Uncle Roy: 1Ups uncle who is also a nudist.

Art:
Everything but the speech bubbles are sketched, inked, and grayscaled on paper with Micron pens, Sharpies, and Prismacolor markers.  After being scanned into a computer, the speech bubbles are added with an inexpensive program called Comic Life Deluxe.

200708 Rejection:
On October 12th, 2007, Harnack received an email from Eddie Lee Eddie Lee, the editor of the California Aggie, telling her that (quantity)^2^ would not be published in the newspaper for its third year (Harnacks senior year at UC Davis).  Harnack emailed him back asking for a reason why the comic was rejected; as of yet no response has been given.  A copy of her application portfolio can be found http://kathyvicki.deviantart.com/art/The10ThatFailed67343729 here.
