Hey, thats my name, too!
 I knew a lifestyle biker who was a sysadmin.  Really danged good with both a wrench and a commandline.  The owner asked him to stay in the server room for various reason when clients took a tour, one of which was rather impressively offensive tattoos, and another of which was his reading  as puckered asshole.  Nice guy, just really rough.  But for awhile I will see your edits and think ah, puckered asshole is editing.
