0  3 at UCD was an alcohol awareness campaign by the Campus Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Program (CADAPP), and facilitated by Health Education and Promotion (HEP).  According to a study conducted by the Cowell Student Health Center in 2000, most Aggies have zero to three Alcohol drinks when they party.  Another campaign, or maybe the same one, by CADAPP featured the slogan Dont be a Dick.

This former program advertised that 71% of students have only 03 drinks when they party, as some form of statistical peer pressure. However, this also means that over 6,000 students have more than 3 drinks when they party, meaning that youre in a pretty sizable minority when you get smashed; 29% of the student population engage in a duel with their livers.

  Useful extrapolated statistics:
    29% of UC Davis students have 4 or more at UCD 4 or more drinks when they party.
    Students are more likely to underestimate the amount they drink rather than overestimate. (Other research bears this out  e.g. http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/C/2003253.html )

     So how does this average out?  I suppose people who do not drink at all partially compensate for others who binge drink.  I saw a guy unloading a keg while wearing one of those 03 shirts in front of my apartment.  Good times.

20060928 21:48:46 nbsp 71%? Thats pathetic. You should all be ashamed for yourself. There is nothing funnier then getting shithouse drunk with friends and doing something very dumb and childlike. You know after college you really cant do that anymore, START CRAMMING. Users/SteveBlais
