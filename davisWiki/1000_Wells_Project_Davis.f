History & Roots
The 1000 Wells Project is a national campaign to raise awareness about the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa, while raising funds for water projects in 1000 African communities over the period of approximately 5 years.  The 1000 Wells Project chapter at UC Davis was founded in the Spring of 2005 by then freshman, Tyson Babayco.  Tyson assembled a group of volunteers from his dorm and other campus service clubs in the hopes of raising around $2,000.00 over a twoweek period.  Students responded generously and 1000 Wells collected nearly double their goal.  During the 2005 campaign, the group was also spotlighted by The California Aggie, The UC Davis Alumni Magazine, and The Davis Enterprise.

The 1000 Wells Project is a division of Blood: Water Mission, a faithbased certified nonprofit organization that teams with other NGOs across the African continent to build the wells and infrastructure needed for community survival.  Less than 10% of the funds go to administrative costs and the rest is used solely for the water projects.

The Blood:Water Mission desires each of the 1000 wells to make a lasting impact in community health and, therefore, focuses on education, sanitation and local leadership as necessary elements of each project. The community based organizations provide appropriate training that is specific to their communities’ needs for clean water and overall health. They also provide sanitation solutions such as latrines where they are needed. Lastly, they work with the communities to create committees to oversee the use, maintenance and repair of their wells.

Inspired by the success of their last two years, 1000 Wells Project Davis has greatly expanded the scope of their campaign for the 2007 school year.  With six months of planning (instead of just one) and a more comprehensive list of goals for the greater Davis community, 1000 Wells is hoping to raise $10,000.  Wells range in cost from approximately $3,000.00 to $15,000.00 depending on depth and the type of pump required to bring water to the surface.  Because 1000 Wells Davis reached their 2007 goal, at least one, and possibly as many as five African communities will have a safe and reliable water source along with the training and support necessary to its sustainability.

Current Goals

This year’s “Share the Well” 1000 Wells campaign is the most ambitious yet. With a goal of $15,000 for the 2008 project, we hope to help alleviate the suffering of HIV/AID victims and break the cycle of injustice and poverty. Join us in this cause to help make the crisis for clean water in Africa history.

Goals for 2008 Campaign:
     Raise $15,000
     Raise awareness within the Davis community and UCD about the need for clean drinking water in SubSaharan Africa
     Empower and equip people to act
     Double our volunteer base

 How is clean water related to HIV/AIDS? 

Eighty percent of all deaths in developing countries are caused by waterborne illnesses. A significant amount of diseases, including illnesses that affect HIV, can be nearly eliminated with the provision of clean water. Our commitment to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis requires action on the problem of unsafe water in Africa.

It is difficult to separate AIDS from the problem of unsafe water. Lack of access to clean water creates vulnerable communities with little hope for survival. As the pandemic distresses various parts of a community, there are several ways to promote a positive shift in the problem of AIDS. Providing wells is an important step to building stronger, healthier communities.
