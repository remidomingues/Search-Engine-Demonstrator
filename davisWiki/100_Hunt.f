The main Campus Lecture Halls lecture hall in Hunt Hall. Although Hunt is technically the home of agronomy and range science, this lecture hall serves the needs of any major ranging from mathematics to asian american studies.

The seats are pretty comfortable and there is a lot of room for your feet between rows, but the desks are pretty small.
