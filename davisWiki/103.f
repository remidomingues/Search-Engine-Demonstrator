20100115 15:59:00 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for your comments on various pages.  I deleted the one for Burgers and Brew, though.  It was just a personal attack and didnt say anything about the restaurant or your experiences there.  You might want to go back and add something that describes your experiences without making a personal attack.  That would definitely be more helpful for other Davisites. Users/CovertProfessor

20100212 13:59:34 nbsp Funny that youre a professor and dont understand the first amendment.  Users/103

20100212 14:19:30 nbsp Your first ammendment rights were not violated. Users/CovertProfessor The professors sense of right and wrong was violated by your comment. Users/JasonAller
  This.  What does the First Amendment have to do with it? Users/TomGarberson

20100212 14:29:35 nbsp Im pretty sure CovertProfessor wasnt acting as the United States Congress and creating a law, so I fail to see how the first amendment applies.  Nor was I when I removed it.  Its pretty common that if people are nasty in public, somebody may well call them out on it.  People are generally civil to their neighbors, and Im sorry that you didnt think polite behavior was expected, but please dont make personal attacks on the wiki. If youll look around, youll notice people are usually pretty civil to each other here.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100212 14:30:29 nbsp Let me try and fill you in on why your B&B comment is being deleted.  Hes a douche offers no information whatsoever to readers, other than that you dont like him.  Why do you feel hes a douche?  Is the service bad?  Is he rude?  Did he try to wash you?  Pure ad hominem is worse than useless and, from what Ive seen, will usually be removed.  If you want to criticize the business, by all means, do so.  Just do so in a way that provides some sort of value. Users/TomGarberson

20100212 14:32:26 nbsp Really?  Users/103
  Yes.  People also usually use their names here (yes, my nickname is actually JabberWokky... my wife calls me Wokky).  You can call me Wokky or Evan.  Pleased to meet you! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100212 14:42:02 nbsp Thats great yo. Yeah, have fun with that.  Users/103
