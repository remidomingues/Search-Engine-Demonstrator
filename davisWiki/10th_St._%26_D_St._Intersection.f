The intersection of 10th Street 10th and D Street D is a good candidate for the title of secondworst intersection in Davis.  There are no stop signs, and there are two gnarly dips on 10th. Occasionally someone will drive through the dips at 30 mph or so and slam the street. Users/PaulThober personally observed a cars front wheels leave the ground after hitting the second dip. At least once a cars airbags deployed because the car slammed so hard. Also, the rightofway is sufficiently ambiguous as to encourage collisions.

Of course, the posted speed limit is 25, at which the intersection is reasonably navigable.

As evidence that nothing is so terrible that good cannot come of it, the DMV sometimes takes people to this location during driving tests.


20051118 12:39:47 nbsp I have some strong reservations about this page secondworst intersection is a subjective view, and I can think of far better candidates (Pole Line and Fifth comes readily to mind). Additionally, the acknowledgement that if one follows the posted speed limit the intersection is reasonably navigable negates the previous paragraph. Again, SLOW down this isnt L.A., and pay attention, and this intersection is just FINE. Also, its a residential street, not a throughway which the reedit fails to mention.  I know this seems like a rant, but I really think this page is kind of unnecessary. Users/CentralDavisite
  Yours is the third runnerup for most discerning comment on the wiki.
