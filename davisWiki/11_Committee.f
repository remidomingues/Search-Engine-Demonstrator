The Nugget Fields Site (known to the Davis Joint Unified School District as the Wildhorse Site) has been in potential flux for several years. As of 3/4/2008, the DJUSD has officially convened an advisory committee to discuss the disposition of the site. This committee is referred to as the 7/11 Committee because the code that calls for its formation specifies that it have not less than 7 nor more than 11 members.

Due to provisions in State law (namely the Naylor Act), the DJUSD needed to find a use for the property or decide that it was officially surplus (meaning the district had no educational use for the property) or else it faced the possibility of being forced to sell it to a public concern (ie the City of Davis or Yolo County) for a fraction of its value. Being under a strict timeline forced by the Naylor Act, the committee asked for and received permission from the school district to bifurcate its duties: it would decide whether the property was surplus separate from soliciting input from the community of potential future uses. In March, the committee recommended and the DJUSD approved that the property be declared surplus.

The next committee meeting is Tuesday, May 6th at 7pm in the Birch Lane Elementary multipurpose room. This is a public meeting requesting input on potential future uses of the property. At the moment the school district favors the idea of working with the community to decide on a broad plan for the property, applying for any necessary changes in zoning, and then selling it to a developer who will work on the overall plan.
