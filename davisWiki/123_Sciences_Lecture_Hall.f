123 Sciences Lecture Hall (SCILEC) (Sci 123 or Sci Lec as most call it) is the largest of the lecture halls on campus containing seats for 519 students. It is located across the street from the Surge I SURGE buildings on Hutchison Drive.  Its a part of the collection of buildings known as the Sciences Laboratory Buildings.

123 Sciences Lecture Hall was completed in late 2004/early 2005 and was first opened during Winter Quarter, 2005.  Theres over 8 normal sized chalkboards to be used, and quite a large projection screen.


This building has become the primary lecture hall for lower division chemistry classes, as well as the infamous nutrition 10, taking away the role from what used to be the main giant hall, 194 Chem.
