  California Code section 12301(a)(6) says a destructive device includes Any sealed device containing dry ice (CO2) or other chemically reactive substances assembled for the purpose of causing an explosion by a chemical reaction. and this section treats this as a felony because of, among other sections, section 12312 Every person who possesses any substance, material, or any combination of substances or materials, with the intent to make any destructive device or any explosive without first obtaining a valid permit to make such destructive device or explosive, is guilty of a felony, and is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years.

20070310 02:34:49 nbsp I was surprised to see that toy pistols are defined as firworks.  Technically, according to this definition, a water gun is a firework. Users/DavidGrundler
    I imagine it means the cap gun toy pistols, as they actually use, or at least used, small bits of explosive stuff
          Im sure you are correct, but that is not the way it is stated.  I find the difference between the interpretation of laws, and the actual laws themselves to be quite interesting. Users/DavidGrundler
