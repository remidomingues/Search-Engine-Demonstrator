20071208 12:27:11 nbsp Wheelworks was there for some time (at least since 1980), before JBs I think. After JBs, it was the Back Alley Brewpub, which didnt last very long. The building sat empty for periods after JBs and before Cantina, during which time it was leased a couple of times for short terms (Republican Party HQ was there for a bit). Will have to think more to put actual dates on businesses. Or one could simply ask the people at JBs. Wheelworks current owner is not the same as it was then, but they might know when they moved anyway. Users/nobodyinparticular
