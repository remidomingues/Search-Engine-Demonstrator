Fooled you! There is no 13th Streets Street in Davis, it jumps from 12th to 14th St.

does anyone know if there is a 1300 block on the north/south streets?  Users/ArlenAbraham

   I checked the address layer of the city Map. Both B Street and F Street have address that are turn into the 1300s where 13th street would be. So does Eureka Avenue and several others. Users/JasonAller

But http://maps.google.com/maps?fq&hlen&geocode&q1300+B+street,+Davis,+california&sll38.554509,121.741948&sspn0.013793,0.029182&ieUTF8&om1&ll38.556724,121.744072&spn0.006896,0.014591&th&z16 yup, 1300 B Street is there.  Looks like B street stops in the 1300s.
So is there no 13th because another named street takes it place or because city planners were superstitious? Users/ElisaHough
  I wouldnt be surprised if it were the latter. Thinking about how in China and Japan. . . Korea too? you avoid the number 4 for a lot of things (like the floors of buildings); thirteen is just as bad here. The true reason would make for neat local trivia.  Users/KevinChin
