194 Chemistry, also known as Chem 194 or 194 Chem is the former name of one of the campus lecture halls lecture halls on the UC Davis campus.  In 2012 it was renamed to Peter A. Rock Hall.  Despite this name change many alumni, students, and community members still refer to this building by its former name. The old projector screen is being sold by the Bargain Barn in August 2013 A 36 projector screen??? Yes, 36 FEET and REALLY HEAVY! Heres a chance to get a piece of UC Davis history. This is the original screen from Chem 194 (now known as Peter A. Rock Hall) from when it used to be a movie theater way back when. If you can use this projector screen contact me and make me an offer! Deal is YOU and a truck load of body builders have to pick it up from the oncampus location. We just dont have a truck that long to transport it (or a truck load of body builders readily available for that matter). Im sorry, no pictures available. Michelle M Borba
