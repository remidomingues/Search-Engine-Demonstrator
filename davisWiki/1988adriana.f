20110516 11:43:17 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Your comment on Cafe Mediterranee raised a few eyebrows.  There arent any details on the police reports or in the Enterprise yet, so it was removed.  It does sound like theres a case open on it at the DPD, though.  Would you be willing to leave a new comment with some detail about what actually happened? Users/TomGarberson
  Agreed... it sounds like you happen to know about something that is about to become public.  If it werent for a bunch of jerks who make fake accusations against businesses that they compete with or they think wronged them, it wouldnt have been removed; a bunch of people cried wolf, and now its hard to be sure whats true, especially when its vague.  If youre aware of something, a bit more detail or some way to confirm it would be fantastic.  It sounds like you have a personal connection.  Please share what you know with the community!
