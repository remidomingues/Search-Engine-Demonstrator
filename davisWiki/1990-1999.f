In that area, the center of the creek serves as the boundary between UC Davis and Solano County. Two adult nephews of Reyes identified the body and said their uncle is an unemployed farm worker whose permanent residence is in Mexico.

Reyes was believed by police to have been beaten and thrown from the 40foot bridge in a robbery attempt.

(http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7227 source)

Investigators have traced the crime back to the afternoon of August 12, when Reyes and the three suspects met up in Dixon and began drinking. About 2am, police believe the four acquaintances went for a ride and ended up at Putah Creek and Old Davis roads, where they pulled over to the shoulder of the twolane roadway and stayed for about ten minutes. At some point, police believe the three demanded Reyes hand over his money, he refused, and they began kicking and punching him before casting his body over the bridge. Police allege he lay there for several hours before being discovered about 10 to 15 feet from the waters edge. An autopsy report indicated Jose Reyes died of internal bleeding, and confirmed investigators belief that a beating took place. (http://63.192.157.117/Current/News/98/08/daily082698.html source)
