Rose (October 5, 1972 – March 27, 2000), and three ecology professors from Kyoto University in Japan: Takuya Abe, Masahiko Higashi and Shigeru Nakano. Five other researchers were rescued, including two UC Davis graduate students, two undergraduates and one postgraduate researcher.

A world expert on scorpions and spiders, Dr. Polis was studying complex food webs and how the sea subsidizes life on desert islands in the Sea of Cortez. The accident occurred just four nautical miles from shore, when one of the groups two open boats was capsized by four to sixfoot waves. US Coast Guard investigators blamed the 24foot boat for the accident, saying it was inadequate for rough water conditions and lacked a bilge pump or other means of removing water; investigators went on to note that life jackets were on board, but several expedition members werent wearing them.

The deaths prompted campus to draft new safety regulations for field expeditions. UC Davis planted five memorial trees &#8211; one for each scientist who died &#8211; in the Arboretum near Putah Creek Lodge.
