20041115 20:40:39 nbsp If you want a falafel, go to Sams or Ali Baba. Pita Pit falafels arent all that great.  Users/MarieHuynh

20041206 14:57:51 nbsp All that great at 2AM doesnt matter when Pita Pits all thats open  Users/TarZxf

20050203 23:35:39 nbsp Theres always Safeway. Users/MarieHuynh

20050315 18:54:25 nbsp Someone just reported that Pita Pit no longer delivers. Thats weird, given the fact that they just sent out a free delivery coupon this week in one of the local circulars. Users/JaimeRaba

20050404 13:33:54 nbsp They havent started delivering again yet, whatever that means. Users/SummerSong
  I think they finally have. Users/AmyZimmerman

20050510 22:57:48 nbsp Holy crap! I had no idea this place was open so late. This may revolutionize my late night dining habits! Users/KrisFricke

20050511 08:30:58 nbsp Yeah, we were chillin outside Pita Pit around 1AM on Friday and this drunkass taxi driver tried to pick us up after he got his pita. He was seriously smashed. Kinda scary. Users/GeorgeLewis
    Friendly cab?  They left a card outside my door one day.  Just my door though, nobody elses...

20050616 22:03:40 nbsp Pita Pit is so awesome, I suggest Tuna, but dont have them cook it, with lettuce, mayo, pickles, onions, and olives. yum yum Users/MichelleAccurso

20050616 22:04:42 nbsp Yucky. Everything tastes like cardboard... well... freezedried cardboard. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050617 21:38:32 nbsp Their pitas would be 10,000 times better if they would heat them in some way. I cant stand the service here though. Users/TerraSmithers

20050709 1:10:05 nbsp Correct me if I am wrong but Ive harbored feelings of nausea toward Pita Pit ever since I thought I saw that they pulled the meat for my pita out of a drawer underneath the grill. Now I dont usually watch what is going on with my food at fast food joints because the less I know the better. And I can only assume that the meat in that drawer is pretty regularly supplied from the fridge but what I do know is that there is no way that drawer could be kept at the temperature necessary to preserve meat. Users/GautamJoshi
 20060521 10:54:08 nbsp Actually most restaurants have undergrill refrigeration.  It is kept amazingly frosty cold.  The last restaurant I worked at, some of the meats and such would often go frozen in the drawer. Users/JenDockter

20050711 10:52:46 nbsp I think their pitas are too small for five bucks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

The pitas size depends on how many toppings you get in them. If you want a bigger pita, get more Veggies.  Users/SierraStudent

20050813 11:24:59 nbsp Ive had the philly cheesesteak pita with the tzatziki sauce and it was pretty good. It was a decent value for the price. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050814 18:52:18 nbsp Ok, if you want attitude and stupidity, but OK pitas, go here. If you want competency go somewhere else. The only advantage this place has over every other place in Davis is that its open well past 10pm Users/WesOne

20051111 23:37:26 nbsp Agreed with the previous comment. I think some of you guys should quit your bitching about the taste of the food here. This town shouldnt even be called a college town. More than half of their restaurants are not even open past 10pm. I first ate a Pita Pit at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio and that town is way smaller than Davis, and they manage to have more restaurants and bars, etc. open. It seems kinda of ludicrous to insult a place that manages to stay open past 2am. Also when you are hungry or bored, it doesnt matter where they get the food from. Users/MikeMele

20051112 02:33:03 nbsp Everything tastes like sodium benzoate... and I always feel a little sick afterwards... even tho the things theyre creating look damn yummy. SO confuzzled. Users/MichaelGiardina
  Im not sure how you know what sodium benzoate tastes like, but Im sure Id feel sick too if I ate enough of it to taste it. Users/SteveDavison

20051221 04:49:49 nbsp I think the Pitas are pretty damned tasty. Admittedly, I usually get the same thing ... over and over again. I always order a Philly Cheese variation. I hear from my friends that the employees are never that pleasant to deal with, but I actually find them to be OK. If you spend a minute opening up to them, theyre really nice. I think they can get a bit hostile from having to deal with the bar crowd every night.  SS

20060222 22:10:44 nbsp Who really wants to open up to the kid making his pita?  Users/JoshFernandez

20060320 12:58:39 nbsp The kid ordering the Pita, terd. SS

20060405 15:54:33 nbsp Pita Pit is a pit. Users/KarenaAslanian

20060515 20:31:09 nbsp Note to Vegetarians: The vegetarian options (or at least the falafel) is cooked on the same surface as the meat without sterilization. Im not a vegetarian so it didnt bother me much, except for their disregard for our purely herbivorous friends. Also, I found the service to be rather curt and generally unfriendly. The veggies were sort of mushy and probably had some sort of fungal infection. As stated in the first comment, yeah falafel isnt so good, and the meat drawer isnt too appetizing. Users/BonnieStewart
  when you order falafel they should ask you if you want it microwaved or on the grill.  You should obviously say microwaved if you are vegetarian.  Users/MattHh

20060614 13:55:28 nbsp Cold, stale pitas with not so great insides at a way too high price. Go elsewhere. Users/MuffIn

20060908 11:14:22 nbsp  the service is horrible. The female blond hair manager is rude, lazy and downright the worst employee i have ever seen in my life.  we walked into pita pit.  there was 2 people working there.  A very nice boy who was working very hard making pitas, and a woman who was chatting with her friends, who were just hanging out in the eating area.  She took the occasional order, and then just continued to talk.  Meanwhile a 10 or so person line formed of people waiting to get their pitas made.  She is still talking, (not talking and doing work at the same time, that would be bad enough, but actually just talking without touching one pita).  now there is about a 12 person build up.  next a man walks in who is the off duty security guard for the area.  She starts talking to him as he is occupying the register while there is a customer who wants to order.  the woman and the security guard are laughing and joking, and the customer looks agitated.  then she finally takes the customers order while still conversing with the security guard (i believe the security guard says something inappropriate).  the customer then says to the woman he just cost you a tip.  the woman then gets all defensive and starts raising her voice at the customer saying how its actually the customers fault shes not getting a tip because hes a jackass.  then the other employee says to the woman actually you just cost us both a tip (since the tip jar is split i assume).  i felt sorry for him since he was working his but off while she was having herself a little party.  Now the customer says something to the degree of why are you talking back to me.  the woman and the security guard then gang up on him calling him fat and ugly and saying stuff like you couldnt get a date with anyone etc.  then some more arguing ensues and she says you know i can refuse service to anyone.  Then the customer says something like, that would be really smart, i already paid and you already have the meat on the grill, im sure the owner would be ecstatic to know you lost a sale and wasted food.  she then says something like, yeah thats right in fact i refuse service, gives the money back and says we dont want your kind here(this may refer to the customer being latino); the customer leaves pissed.  I then say to the other employee, how could she still work here with an attitude about work like that? he replied, thats why i put in my two weeks notice, monday is my last day.  In the whole time i was there she never touched one pita.  the only thing she was responsible for was negative sales and food wasteage. Users/MattHh

  she no longer works there, I hope you come back. I think youll find Much better service now :P  Users/SierraStudent

20060924 15:12:34 nbsp a guy working late at night last week at 2am was really nice and conversational. im sure he gets the whole drunk bar crowd late at night and he seems to like the entertainment. i dont go to pita cause i think its too expensive for what you get, but the people ive ran into there are always pleasant. Users/EightFishies

20060924 15:17:21 nbsp I tried to film in Pita Pit, just documenting my night on Friday, and the employees didnt want to be filmed without reason. I told them I was just documenting my night but they didnt believe me. Luckily, I got some shots of them and theres nothing they can do about it now. But they were friendly enough in their refusal to let me film, so Im grateful that they werent jerks about it. I still think Sams and Ali Babas are both better than the Pita Pit, however. Users/JohnDudek

20061203 21:53:10 nbsp Last week I got a pita and I took a bite and there was a 2x3 inch long piece of plastic packaging inside. Fun discoveries!  Users/SoCalGal
