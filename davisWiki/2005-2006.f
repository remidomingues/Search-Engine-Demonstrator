This is a summary of the 20052006 ASUCD Budget.  The Expense, Subsidy, and Difference from FY 0405 figures are accurate, but the Salary/Expense figures are from the Presidents proposal.  Im sure you can guess the correct numbers, more or less.

 The budget passed without objection on June 2, 2005 by the ASUCD Senate.

Blue rows are selfsufficient units. Red rows are subsidized units:

 Income 


The Coffee House does indeed make a large amount of money for ASUCD, but it is budgeted to break even  as a nonprofit organization, ASUCD isnt supposed to be making any money.  In actuality, a few parts of it make money and the other parts spend money.

 Critical points 

The 2005 Budget brings its share of critical points.  Noteworthy are:

  Two new units: Campus Outreach and Organizing Office which will be located at the former ASUCD Student Center  (will cost $17,130), and the Campus Center for the Environment (will cost $6,809).   Turbulence, Health and Well Being Committee, Student Advocacy and positions from the External Affairs Office were cut because they will now fall under the scope of the CO3, that is where a lot of the money came from for the Campus Outreach and Organizing Office.

  $30,000 is cut from the Entertainment Council.  The cut was primarily justified because the unit allegedly misspent the year before and because the entire staff would be new and inexperienced (http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/24/FrontPage/Entertainment.Council.Faces.30000.Budget.Cutasucd.Budget.Part.21320673.shtml src).  See http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/24/FrontPage/Entertainment.Council.Faces.30000.Budget.Cutasucd.Budget.Part.21320673.shtml Aggie article and http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/26/Features/YourFavourite.Band.Sucks1320708.shtml Chris Caskeys Aggie column in regards to this.
   Also note, the current director of the Entertainment Council proposed the recently approved self promoted shows budget at $75,000. This budget, in this aspect, was not cut further than they suggested themselves.  Due to the fact that these costs were lowered, so were other costs; such as, services rendered which went down $7000 because they would need less equipment rental, set up, technicians etc. if they have less selfpromoted shows.
  Aggie Pack is cut from $11,000 to $6,000.  The primary justification for this is that Aggie Pack is not an ASUCD unit; they are a subsidiary of the UCD Athletics Athletics Department which receives a large portion of student fees every year.  The cut money was moved to Cal Aggie Camp and was able to fund an extra week of the program for the children who benefit from it (45 more children will be able to attend this year than in past years) as well as to the Club Finance Council, who will get $3,662 more than they asked for  allowing more oncampus clubs to recieve funds.  See the http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/26/FrontPage/Hearings.End.With.Cuts.To.Aggie.Packasucd.Budget.Part.41320710.shtml Aggie story on hearing that day.
    Please note that the Aggie Pack sponsorship this was not a permanent cut. When I proposed to shift around some money I did so knowing there would be what is called rollover money, in the ASUCD budget from the 0405 school year. During the budget hearings we talked about funding some of the Campus Center for the Environment CCEs programmatic budget with this money. As an ASUCD Senator my first priority is ASUCD units and Aggie Pack is not an ASUCD Unit. I investigated Aggie Pack and since they are a subsidiary of the Athletics Department, which is sponsored by things such as CocoCola and Comcast, I assumed there would be money in the pot. I did not want to purely assume so I contacted http://www.gsm.ucdavis.edu/innovator/winter2003/BraytonBleedsAggieBlueAndGold.pdf Scott Brayton of Aggie Pack and told him that I wanted to cut some of ASUCDs sponsorship of Aggie Pack in order to fund an ASUCD unit. I also told Scott that ASUCD was facing a $30,000 budget deficit (which is largely the fault of Kalen Gallagher this man) and that I wanted to fully fund Cal Aggie Camp which is an ASUCD unit that is a summer program for underprivileged children in the Sacramento/Yolo county region. Scott told me in an email that Aggie Pack will brace for a cut of some sort in funding from ASUCD. Since I feel like it is easier for Aggie Pack to get sponsorship than poor kids who depend on the ASUCD (as well as the http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2004/10/20/FrontPage/KidsCamp.Faces.Challenges1318446.shtml Greek Week fundraiser) in order to go to camp I proposed to make the cut. And to be honest I was very passionate and very jerkish to my fellow Senators when I did so. But I also knew about the money that would be rolled over and I knew that it could be used for things like Club Finance Council CFC and Aggie Pack. But keep in mind that the rollover goes into effect on July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, so a summer program can not depend on this entirely. Aggie Pack could get a bunch of money on July 1 and be OK for the next school year. What happened was though, people over reacted because they did not know exactly how the budget worked and they thought Aggie Pack was going to be destroyed. This was not the case. The local Ben & Jerrys, of which I am a manager of, has donated $12,500 worth of product to Aggie Pack, and in fact we have given Aggie Pack permission to sell 10% of that product so I know that Aggie Pack has sponsors. I will be honest and say I am not an athletic person and in fact I have never attended a sports game other than Intramural sports. But I do realize that many people on campus love Aggie Pack and I do not want to stab my constituents in the back. Let me just say that operating a budget is tough and if you talk to most ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senators they will say they are happy with this yearÂ’s budget. As an example of how you cant please everybody CM Caskey complained about the cutting of ASUCD Entertainment Council Entertainment Councils budget and the over funding of Aggie Pack through the Aggie Pack Firetruck in his The California Aggie Aggie http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/26/Features/YourFavourite.Band.Sucks1320708.shtml column. Yet probably many members of Aggie Pack have never been to an Entertainment Council promoted show on campus. So, after a couple of urgent bills passed by the ASUCD Senate on May 26, Aggie Pack is getting $14,000 from the ASUCD and Cal Aggie Camp is getting fully funded. The socks are going to be getting shot through tubes and the kids are going to camp. Like I said before, this is a good budget.  Users/RobRoy
