20050812 19:23:34 nbsp Im very skeptical of the price savings scoreboard at Nugget stores. It doesnt explain what the numbers mean, and it just doesnt seem possible that Nugget could beat Safeway and Albertsons on price across the board. Produce and dairy prices are pretty competitive, and prices for many specialty items seem more than fair, but just about everything else (e.g. cereal, homewares, pasta sauce) seems to be priced much higher than at other stores.

According to their website, the Price Challenge is that you bring in $100 of groceries from another store, then they scan them in and see if it would have been cheaper at Nugget.  If it isnt, they pay double the difference plus $10.  The scoreboard presumably tracks wins versus losses on that challenge.  Maybe the savings on produce and dairy make up for cereal and pasta?

20050813 10:53:43 nbsp The raw sausages they sell in a variety of different flavors are excellent when BBQd.  Of particular note in this regard is the pineapple teriyaki sausage. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050815 18:46:55 nbsp They raised the rice bowl price in the last few months. Used to be 2.99  which was a great deal.  Now its $3.99, except for Happy Hour 112  $2.99 during random days/weeks. Users/EdWins ES

20051004 21:47:02 nbsp While I have no information about prices at this store, back when I intensively did compare prices between a health food store and supermarkets I discovered that its critical which items you are comparing. The health food items were considerably cheaper in the health food store, and the unhealth food items were cheaper at the supermarkets. I assume this has to do with supplier volume.

20051022 12:15:46 nbsp HORSESHIT They raised the price of their sandwich by a full DOLLAR (theyre now $6.50). Users/MattJojola

20051026 11:32:22 nbsp The panini sandwiches are tiny for $6.99, and not particularly wonderful. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051112 01:09:22 nbsp Always a wonderfully rare little oddity bit of food to bring home and try. Nugget wasnt that expensive really, and they always carried the strange ingredients I needed for more exotic cooking. Friendly staff, lots of cheese (woo!), and a fantastic selection natural or exotic foods. If theres one thing I miss about Davis, its Nugget. Users/TarynHornen

20051210 21:41:46 nbsp If you like brussels sprouts, try their brussels sprouts salad with pancetta and pine nuts. Its even better heated! Users/JohnnaSarkis

20051221 04:27:57 nbsp I think the Nugget is too expensive for me. That said, I happen to like their Chinese food. Late nights, at like, 9:30, theyll clean out the bins and put the remaining food into big containers to sell off for $3.75 each. Theyre pretty good, I think. SS
