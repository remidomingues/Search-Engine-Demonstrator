We need you to help out with Wiki Promotion current efforts!!!

 Fall 2005 Advertising Drive 
Its a natural time to focus on the Campus but once were ramped up we can easily extend into the community.

 Flyering 
 Wiki Flyer Wiki Flyers are being torn down as fast as they are being put up. For this reason there is really no reason to post flyers on campus. Instead, hand out quarter sheets. Theyre more effective anyways.

 Getting torn down? 
20050929 16:00:51 nbsp Nearly all of the wiki flyers that were put up yesterday have been torn down. I suspect that it was a malicious act against the wiki as no other posters on the boards were torn down except for ours. I have wondered in the past whether our flyers were being torn down. Now, Im sure of it. If you are the person that takes them down, please explain yourself.

update: The posters that I reposted in Wellman yesterday afternoon have been torn down again. This time I was sure to post only one flyer per board. I believe that all regulations were followed. Someone is tearing them down...  Users/JackHaskel

20051010 11:19:43 I dont think the school likes the Wiki much  I spent this saturday putting up flyers all over Wellman; sure enough, on monday, they were gone. Users/GeoffJohnson
  At this point dont even bother putting flyers up on campus. They are usually torn down the same day. If you want to, you can hand out quarter sheets. Users/JackHaskel
    Torn down everywhere, or just in Wellman?
     Everywhere. Including one special flyer that had been up for nearly a year.

I wouldnt worry about flyers being torn down.  I doubt theres any grand conspiracy  likely just someone getting tired of seeing a bunch of flyers!  At the rate that flyers are put up on the boards its really no surprise that theyre all gone the next day.  Flyers have a lifespan of a few hours!  Considering the number of people out in the quad advertising their various clubs, I think its a matter of space and so forth rather than anyone targeting the wiki. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Id like to think that the person that is tearing down the flyers is the same person that is tagging Daviswiki.org all over school.

Its definitely not targeted at the wiki.  Other organizations and disorganizations Im involved with have the same problem.  I do note, however, an unusually high number of roommate wanted flyers.  Instead of some grand conspiracy, I suspect individuals without a flyer budget are tearing down everything that covers them up.  So theres really no massive conspiracy of SPAC and Cost Plus World Market here, its just people desperate to make rent.  Users/BrentLaabs
  Im not entirely sure of that. I have a class in Hutchison 115, and I as I was opening the door to enter the classroom, I saw an older man, gray hair, 55 to 60ish pull a wiki flyer down, then just walk away. As far as I could tell, he neither pulled anything else down, nor put any new flyers up.  Users/AnnaJones
   Thats...eerie. Users/GeoffJohnson
   I know who the guy is.  He patrols the boards and tries to enforce SPAC posting rules. He pulls off multiple copies of the same fliers, fliers for old events, and rearranges the remaining fliers so you can se all of them.  He bought a special staple remover with a lever and then modded it.  And no, he doesnt get paid to do this.  Its his hobby.
     If hes pulling all of them down, hes not following SPAC rules. I feel tearing down others nonoutdated fliers is as bad as putting a dozen of your own up (obscuring others). Both are antifree speech, and thats bad. Users/SteveDavison
  I too have noticed an abnormal number of for rent flyers. I dont think that its those people who are tearing down other fliers though. Wiki flyers werent put up on to of anything. It is true though that the wiki is not the only organization who is having all of their flyers systematically torn down.

 Wiki Cards 
 How many are left? Should we make more? A good strategy is to only hand them out selectively. Give them to people that are either popular or engaged and active in life. Have a conversation with them about the wiki and then offer them the cool card.
  Theres practically no cards left and I dont have the design myself.  They were kind of hard to make.  For the student demographic I think a wiki sticker sticker will work just as well.  There are hundreds of stickers left from the last printing.

 Dorm drive 
 Were not allowed to advertise in or around the dorms. Will this stop us from doing it anyways? How about handing out flyers infront of the DC?

 Media 
 Who is up for talking to the Davis Enterprise? I bet theyll do another little blurb.
  The Labster and I have been coming up with some fun TV commercials. How much does/would it cost to broadcast a commercial on local television? Ideas/suggestions? Users/MichelleAccurso

 Stores 
 Itll be easy to post flyers in stores and other community places once we have the flyers in hand.

 Chalking 
 Is there a stencil?
  During a late night adventure in the Physics and Geology Physic Building I wrote the wikis URL on a random chalkboard. I also rode the elevator chairs! Users/michelleaccurso

 Fraternity/Sorority outreach 
 The greeks do a huge advertising drive during this period for their rush. We should contact them and get them to utilise the events board in addition to their massive chalkings.

 Tabling 
 Tabling should definitely be done! Is there a banner? When can we reserve tables for opening week? People tabling should have wiki shirts and flyers to hand out.

 Farmers Market 
Users/PhilipNeustrom, Users/TarZxf, Users/ArlenAbraham and Users/KenjiYamada tabled at the Farmers Market on Oct. 12, 2005.  There is no WiFi signal, but there is a power outlit.  We installed a local version of the http://dev.daviswiki.org wiki software and downloaded a current copy of the wiki to show people as they passed by.

It worked out fairly well, though we got there somewhat late (6PM).  I think we should try and do this whenever possible.  If youre free and willing to table, just put your name here and the time when youre able to do it.  Its seriously easy  just sit there, talk to people, and eat farmers market food!

 Wiki Shirts 
 People handing our flyers and tabling should be wearing wiki shirts.

 Wiki in Campus Publications 
 The wiki was featured in HyperText. The article is available http://scg.ucdavis.edu/hypertext/2005fallwithmap.pdf here!

20050913 10:26:41 nbsp this is also a good time to put flyers in apartment complexes.  many places have bulletin boards near the mailbox areas.  customize the flyer to your apartment complex and it should attract more eyes. But also, if anyone is making customized apartment complexspecific flyers, they should be able to just print out a few and not have any need for photocopying. Users/CarlMcCabe
  Good idea Carl. Anyone have access to photocopier that we can use for free? Ive already spent over $20 on copies in the past and would rather not have to pay for the thousand or so copies that were going to need made. Users/JackHaskel
    Ive heard whispers here and there about a small amount of funds from donations to the wiki.  Anybody know if photocopying is a reasonable use of those funds?  (if they really do exist in the first place) Users/CarlMcCabe
      Totally.  Its cheap, too.

20050913 16:23:31 nbsp All the people with a brain already know about DavisWiki.org Users/SteveDavison

20050929 22:21:58 nbsp I liked Carls one liner.  That would incite curiosity among freshmen.  esp if they see it in their dorms, by the dc, or by their bike parking, etc.  Davis Wiki is why everybody else knows more about Davis than you do.   Users/EdWins ES
   Your quote would work great on a flyer.  Make it happen!

20051012 16:56:41 nbsp You could buy 5k custom printed business cards for $335 bucks.  Make the design so it fits on half the card.  Cut them in half and you get 10,000.  If its too steep you can buy less.  The priniting would be high quality (color on one side, b&W on the other, looks better than a photocopy), the size could be sort of novel and attention getting if designed well, you could have two designs  one on each half of the card...  just a thought. Users/SteveLambert

20051012 17:07:48 nbsp 5,000 business cards in the same design is an amazing waste, and 10,000 cards is just unimaginable.  If you have any ideas on a really novel form factor or design, let us know and well print a few hundred. Users/MikeIvanov

20051012 21:19:03 nbsp ok sure thats too many.  Im just saying, you could get a lot for a little money.  If you printed 1,000, thatd be $160 or so.  You would end up with 2k total.  The amount of paper used would be substantially less than photocopied flyers and they would look better.  Ill think on a design. Users/SteveLambert

20051019 07:03:15 nbsp this page reads like a page off the Golden Valley Evangelism for Christ section. Users/ApolloStumpy
    Evangelism is evangelism.  Theres little difference between the tactics of a good teacher and a good minister and a good essayist and a good politician.  It all depends on your position on the thoughts that they are expousing as to if you support them.  Spreading the word about something you consider important looks pretty much the same if youre trying to save the whales, save peoples souls or get people to understand the Wiki. Users/JabberWokky

20051020 06:02:17 nbsp The reason the flyers were torn down may have been that they were perceived as being commercial. Wiki should have had a table at the Activities Faire yesterday, or even someone passing out stickers. I think this, and the Gathering indecision shows the weakness of democracy (no leadership). Users/SteveDavison
  Only registered student clubs were allowed to table.

20051020 10:12:35 nbsp Wiki Birthday party BBQ.  I know the date for the next BBQ is coming up, but perhaps there could be some promotion of this.  I bet we could get it announced on KDVS or something.  Anyone agree?   also, do we need a noise permit (or some other kind) to have a band play at a park?  (Im thinking we might.) Users/JaimeRaba

20051207 21:27:30 nbsp I wouldnt mind Wiki tabling at the Farmers Market. Just let me know when I should do it. Thanks. Users/JohnDudek
  Ive still got a card table waiting outside which Philip never picked up. Users/SteveDavison

20051211 13:19:17 nbsp I, the Media Coordinator for the ASUCD Elections Committee, think we should work with DavisWiki to promote both the elections and this site, as this site is a vaulable resource and media outlet and should not be ignored.  The Aggie as also been very Shadiness Factor shady so Id like to stop giving them thousands of dollars while they print Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Turnout Controversy libel. Users/MarieHuynh
  You go, girl! Users/SteveDavison
