20050721 11:22:33 nbsp I personally try to avoid this location.  Last time I went there they were giving away free chewing tobacco at the door.  Users/AllanRae

20050905 14:13:00 nbsp I think the bouncers at this place are training to be cops.  You better not be in a pool game when they decide to close the doors.  Users/PatrickLynch

20060105 18:59:10 nbsp The Graduate was having 1418 Night on Graduation Night last quarter, and as such no graduates could attend The Graduate on their Graduation Night.  I think they should have their name revoked! Users/KrisFricke

20060205 23:43:08 nbsp If you live in a residential area nearby, you can (and should) complain to the Davis Police Department police when the Grad gets too noisy, as they often do. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060206 12:59:14 nbsp The food here is pretty decent, I ate here a few times and enjoyed myself.  They always have a bunch of sports games on in the day time which is also nice.  The one thing I dont like about the day time is the amount of little kids running around.  Lots of soccer or baseball teams seem to come for postgame meals and such so it can get a little crazy. Users/BenWebber

20060313 19:36:31 nbsp Swing nights are coming back, after being absent for a couple years. This time its better than ever. DJ Scottie is a personal friend of mine, and hes great. All of you should try swing dancing! Lessons are usually at 9 or 9:30, on certain Sundays. Just look around for flyers or ask me. Thursday nights at the Grad are Salsa nights. Thats also lots of fun. The bouncers, staff, etc. arent all that mean like people say...just dont do anything stupid or illegal. Users/LaurenWong

20060807 19:01:05 nbsp Couple of changes to the information about the Grad: Country nights are still Saturday and Monday, with an occasional Sunday thrown in, and it costs $11 if youre under 21, $8 for under 21 with a student ID, $8 if youre over 21, and $5 if youre over 21 and have a student ID.  If youre over 21 and you get there before 9:00pm, theyll let you in for free.  Dance lessons start at 9:30pm and general dancing starts at 10:00pm.  It usually goes until about 1:30am, with a break for hiphop and slow dances around midnight. Users/SteffiChristiana

20060912 20:49:10 nbsp Tuesday nights are now Rock It! which is going to be a weekly Indie Rock dance party. 18+, drink specials and fun music Users/JordanSmart

20060923 20:27:38 nbsp The pizza isnt very good, and its even worse reheated the next day.  Users/AnnaJones

20060928 17:36:14 nbsp Dude, all ages dancing was halarious! Also, I think its a law that all 1st and 2nd year students go to the Grad once you get back into Davis city limits. Users/SteveBlais

20060929 12:41:15 nbsp I like their fries, but their chicken tenders are WAY to spicey... Users/JoeRunnels
