These are comments about Trader Joes from 2005 and 2006. They include material about Davis politics that ties into possible sites for Trader Joes (or did in the minds of the editors responsible).



Well, there isnt a http://traderjoes.com Trader Joes in Davis... yet. Some have said they would never come to a town like Davis. Others wish they would replace Food Fair or the former Harvest Market (now Cost Plus World Market Cost Plus). The concern is that they would take business from our beloved Davis Food Coop. We do miss the Cheap Food inexpensive, upscale variety of TJs though. For these reasons, a TJs in far East Davis East or West Davis would be welcome. The West end has Village Homes to feed it, the East end may have the population (especially if Covell Village goes through). The Davis Wish List shows there are many who would like one. Users/KenBloom said hes read actual plans to build one at 8th Street 8th & Pole Line Road Pole Line. If Covell Village was approved (Measure X), it would gave definitely included a Trader Joes. The lease http://davisenterprise.com/articles/2005/10/07/news/086new1.txt had been signed. Users/AaAa claims that Trader Joes denies this and has recently asked the developers to stop using their name in the Measure X campaign. Trader Joes would be within walking distance for the residents.

But even though Covell Village did not pass, Davis will likely still get a Trader Joes. Covell Village is not Davis only chance at securing a Trader Joes. TJ was already in negotions with two locations in Davis. Alhambra Center at Mace & Alhambra which has not yet been approved and with the Interland/South Davis Center which has been approved and is nearing construction. Also, rumor has it that if the Second Street Crossing (Target) is approved by the City Council in May of 2006, then a Trader Joes may be built at that shopping center at the corner of Mace and Second Street (hardly Walking Distance walking distance for most of Davis but certainly Unitrans bussing distance). If this plan goes through it would be completed by 2008.



20051023 10:18:07 nbsp Id be ok with the Trader Joes giving the Coop some competition. Trader Joes also takes in products from local farmers. Users/ApolloStumpy
  I heard that none of Trader Joes produce is local. In fact, it was almost all from abroad. Is this true? Users/JackHaskel
  According to Trader Joes this statement is FALSE. Trader Joes does sell some local produce, I do not know how much, but I here it is a significant amount. In response to a customer who aked why the prices were different in her local trader joes in california vs. the one in another state, Trader Joes responded by saying
     Trader Joes has stores in many states and regions and we try to source goods locally where we can. Because of this, we have a selection of fresh deli products, breads, dairy and juices that will vary in most states.   Users/MattHh
  TJs outlines its many organic items in this http://www.traderjoes.com/products/WCorganic.pdf brochure, but they dont say anything specific about using local produce.  Users/CraigBrozinsky
    Either way, they treat their employees better and offer better selection. If the coop cant compete, then it should get out of town. Users/ApolloStumpy
     Mindless Capitalism, 101: three cheers for products over people! Unconscious consumerism for all! Social Darwinism is the ultimate measure of man! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Users/ZacharyNorwood
       How much does the coop pay its workers and managers compared to Trader Joes? Oh, I get it...they dont deal with money there...workers get warm fuzzies, and that pays all the bills in this high rent town. Trader Joes also buys plenty of fair trade products...so maybe its not the farmer in Solano who benefits as much, but some indy produce maker is benefiting, and probably more of them too, thanks to Trader Joes better management and leverage.  Users/ApolloStumpy
        You have to analyze things case by case.  Im a fan of TJs, but when its corporate expansion starts scheming with development projects, I take time to reevaluate their motives and overall, comparative worth. Star Bucks has fair trade coffee, but I wouldnt call them advocates of fairtrade. The benifits of a TJs are insignificant, by the waytheyre frivolous benifits. Ohhh, now I can get TJs beef jerkywow, my life is better. And my position is not coop vs. TJs, btw (but you seem to bend logic to your liking). Users/ZacharyNorwood

             20051023 20:20:57 nbsp And my position is not abject capitalism. You started with the idiot logic and now when challenged, you cant even show how the coop is a more humane business than Trader Joes. From http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_17/b3880016.htm Businessweek :

             One place where TJs has never stinted is with its employees. Besides aboveunion wages and generous bonuses (pay for entrylevel parttimers starts at $8 to $12 an hour; firstyear supervisors average more than $40,000 a year), TJs contributes an additional 15.4% of each workers gross pay into a companyfunded retirement plan.   Remind me, what does the coop offer? 11% off of their exoborant prices? Oh boy!    Users/ApolloStumpy
                Heheokay, let me explain things to you explicitly, since your awareness of logic (and by this I mean informal logic, of course) isnt too keen: (a) by not supporting TJs, it does not follow, necessarily, that one supports the coop (these positions are not mutually exclusive, yet you conflate the two nonetheless) and (b) it does not necessarily follow that if a company gives its employees comparatively better wages that it is a superior company, in every other way, or that it is a necessary addition to society. Is that clear enough? Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN
                 My comments have solely been about Trader Joes and Coop competing with each other. If you want to bring in trader joes agreement with the Covell Village, then start your own comment thread. Instead, you bash me for being a mindless capitalist just because Im cool with Trader Joes being competitive with coop. Users/ApolloStumpy

                  Dont forget the logic bashing, too! Thats important. Good day.Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20051219 19:57:02 nbsp It was amazing how the school newspaper turned the prop X debate into pro or con trader joes and ignored the real issue of having a housing development there.  Trader Joes was like the developers Trojan Horse.   Users/DudeNude

20060605 16:12:11 nbsp Id be happy to see Trader Joes in the UMall, but am dubious of the can handle the loss of spaces comment in the article.  Would they build into the existing mall? Outside across from Cost Plus? The lot always looks pretty crowded whenever Im there. But Bicycling Bike City, USA, right?  So no problem! Users/KevinChin

20060605 16:32:54 nbsp After reading the article, I was about to post the same thing that Kevin said...that parking lot is terrible! If they reallocate the spaces...then maybe it could be better, but otherwise, with both Cost Plus AND Trader Joes...I fear that parking will be impossible.  Users/KarlaFung

20060605 16:42:14 nbsp I cant imagine any configuration of that parking lot that would work with a Trader Joes plopped into the middle of it. Its a nice location in theory (increased traffic on Russell notwithstanding), but personally Id much rather Trader Joes just usurp Cost Pluss space. Maybe they can carve out an Old Teahouse sized plot and call it the Trader Joes Express Users/TravisGrathwell

20060605 18:34:25 nbsp Where Food Fair was would be absolutely ideal. Even if it used only half or a quarter of the building.  That shopping center kinda sucks, might help revitalize it.   Parking wouldnt be a problem at all. But YAY on Trader Joes no matter where it is, since people will go.  Users/EdWins ES

20060605 22:49:44 nbsp From what I heard (through the downtown grapevine) they are going to shuffle some of the businesses around inside the University Mall to create most of the space.  I, personally would have preferred to see Traders Joes downtown  in the parking lot behind Kinkos.  Theyre planning to build a 3 story parking structure there eventually anyway.  Or anywhere downtown.  It would provide a great boost to downtown businesses.  The Food Fair location is too far outside of the center.  It will probably be converted to office space.    Users/JonFenske

20060605 23:13:22 nbsp Nah, its not far at all, I think everyone would definitely still make the trip by bike, bus, or car.  West Davis doesnt have a nice shopping center, just that ghostlike one.  I meant if Trader Joes comes, it might revamp it and maybe some other small and nice things will lease there too.  Turn it into a respectable shopping center worth going to rather then a block of junk space and a couple restaurants.   Users/EdWins ES

20060606 09:30:53 nbsp If TJs ends up in the UMall, is there any concern that it will take buisness away from Cost Plus?  Cost Plus has a large selection of dry goods and wine.  TJs surely will impact Cost Plus food sales.  Users/DaveBanister

20060606 11:10:40 nbsp Please, please, I urge everyone not to find reasons to protest this store coming to Davis.  The location is fine.  The neighboring students will benefit having more food options close by.  Cost Plus will not suffer.  In fact, they will benefit.  People coming to Trader Joes will drop in to their store while they are there, and vice versa.   Users/SharlaDaly

20060606 11:32:36 nbsp In my home town, TJs and Cost Plus are right across the parking lot from each other and have been for quite a few years now. I dont think one has ruined the others business. However, I still say that the location although ideal, given the circumstances of parking, traffic flow, etc....will suck ultimately. Users/KarlaFung

20060606 11:46:16 nbsp Im shocked, SHOCKED! This has to be stopped! Think of the traffic in the neighborhood! Where will all the customers park? Think of the crime! It will destroy downtown businesses! Davis is a small, charming village and corporate despoilers are coming! Think of the poor tenants in University Commons Apartments and Sycamore Lane Apartments. When they signed their leases Im sure they didnt anticipate having to live next door to THIS! Join DONT (Davisites Opposed to New Trader joes) Website coming soon. Users/PaulThober

20060606 13:42:36 nbsp I wrote to Trader Joe’s two years ago and warned them about Davis and the ridiculous hostility they would face if they tried to develop a store in the community. They would be much better off building stores elsewhere. At least they figured a reasonably good location – in the middle of the student population (the normal people) and generally away from everyone else. Users/SteveHayes

20060606 15:17:13 nbsp I read Sharlas comment and laughed. Ive been waiting for a TJs for so long I almost edited my comment after I wrote it.  But ultimately Id still take one anywhere in town (any City Councillors listening? I havent voted yet, you know!). Even at the UMall itll mean that Ill have one less reason to drive to Sac, and thats worth the bike ride over. Mmmm. . . I can just taste the Monteblue & Populet now. . . Users/KevinChin

  Was alerted to the http://www.cityofdavis.org/meetings/councilpackets/20060711/07_Trader_JoesUniversity_Mall.pdf City Council Meeting packet on Trader Joes, and have to admit that I forgot entirely about the parking on the west side. The link also has a map of the site plan around p. 15 of the pdf. K

20060606 19:12:02 nbsp If theres a Trader Joes in Davis, and CostCo and (a bigger and nicer) Target in Woodland, I think I can even live without a Target in Davis.  Of course, I figure theres a lot more reason to have a Target than all those damn car dealerships... Users/JaimeRaba


Clearly it is ridiculous to compare building a target in Davis and building a trader Joe’s.  Target is a one stop shopping super center while trader Joes is more like a grocery store.  the people who are against trader Joes because they are a corporation that will hurt small business must have been against Safeway, Albertsons, rite aid, longs, and other stores of similar size or they are acting like hypocrites.  This area of Davis lacks a grocery store near buy.  Students living at the dorms result to buying junk food at rite aid and the DC food stores.  Students deserve access to produce and other health items.  Remember that students at the dorms are not aloud a car, so Safeway and Albertsons are terribly inconvenient for them (biking provides a challenge for caring back groceries if you don’t have a large basket.   Secondly target clearly PLANS on taking business away from a lot of stores including grocery stores and drug stores.  They can afford to offer below cost food items to get people to come there to shop for appliances and clothing ect.   Target will put other stores out of business.  Target would not move here if they planned not to, it just wouldn’t be profitable.   Simply taking sales that would otherwise go to the woodland target or other outside big box stores would cause target as a company to lose a lot of money, because all they would be doing is increasing cost by a lot and only increasing total sales as a corporation by very little.  the only way they can make money by moving a target to Davis is by taking business from other stores or getting the public to spend more money.  And most people are on at least a semi fixed income so the former seems way more likely.  Trader Joe’s would be catering to students living in the dorms which is a somewhat untapped market.  The coop would still exist because the people who shop at the coop are not concerned about price anyway or else they would shop at other grocery stores. Users/MattHh

20060808 13:39:52 nbsp Parking would not be too much of a problem if U Mall were able to prevent students from parking there as a substitute for parking on campus.  A security guard patrolling for this kind of parking misuse would free us as much parking as TJs would remove.  Also, the parking lot is at its capacity when the grad is full, but most of the other business are closed anyway, including TJs.  I think it could work.  And I think Davis is big enough for TJs and the CoOp, and it might prompt the CoOp to improve to compete.  Competition is good for consumers, and in a competitive market, the customer is king.  Let consumers vote with their dollars, not lobby the city council. Users/MatthewPearson

Less parking is a good thing. fewer parking spots  turn to alternative transportation  less traffic.

20061015 22:29:44 nbsp Yesterday I saw a Trader Joes coming soon sign on the kiosk in front of the old Food Fair Users/RobiPochapin

20061015 23:36:53 nbsp I saw the same thing as Robi on Saturday.  A sign at the small shopping cneter in West Davis. Users/JoAnnaRich

20061016 04:16:50 nbsp I have also seen the same sign, though there is nothing posted on their site. Users/JamesKrause

20061016 15:56:28 nbsp As of Mon. afternoon the official looking but fishy seeming sign has been removed from the kiosk at Westlake shopping center.   I spoke with Steve at the Stonegate club and learned that the management of Westlake said something like Huh? when asked whats up?.  Well just keep our fingers crossed here in the Far West Users/RobiPochapin
