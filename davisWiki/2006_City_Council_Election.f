 March 20th Candidate Forum 
On Monday March 20 the first Candidate Forum was held at 7pm at the Community Chambers.


Six preselected and four audience generated questions were answered by the candidates. The short forms of the first six questions and paraphrased summaries of each candidates answers follow:

 1. Do you support the building of the proposed Target store at Second Street.
  RR: Balanced not wanting it with the 270,000 transactions per year. Doesnt like the location proposed.
  ML: Wants to diversify the tax base but think that there needs to be dialog. Store is too large. Not fair to the neighbors.
  SF: Does not support. Breaks Faith with Mace Ranch community. Bad effect on downtown.
  LH: Opposes any Target in or near Davis.
  RA: EIR still in progress. When making this kind of decision considers service impact, neighborhood impact and tax base.

 2. University Village and City relationship with University.
  ML: Only option is to work in collaboration. West Village was predictable given known factors. Focus should be on making the project better.
  SF: University will not risk changes that would require a second EIR given community lawsuits the first time around. Prevent access to Russell. Establish contract for any services provided.
  LH: Prevent access to Russell. Only annex if it pencils out.
  RA: Working on an MOU with the University aimed at mitigation.
  RR: Annexation would be natural given who will be living there.

 3. Relationships between City Council and the 27 Commissions.
  SF: Respects the expertise of the commissions. Suggests listen to them. Increase public speaking at meetings.
  LH: Listen to them and read what they write. Served on 3.
  RA: City Council is seat of ultimate responsibility.
  RR: Listen. Referred to members as most likely experts on topic. HRC listens to voice that hasnt been heard.
  ML: Served on 2, Wife on 1. Council must build on commissions inputs, but decide for itself. Wants earlier involvement with commissions. Need more participation.

 4. Fiscal Stability, does the City have a spending problem?
  LH: Will vote for G because it is the only option presented by the current Council. He would not have put it forward. Audit first, cut if needed.
  RA: State has cut funds to the City. Anticipates a balanced budget this year.
  RR: Does not support G. Says that it is regressive and that it should be based on square footage. Raise development fees. Downtown undergoing revival. Future park should be BMX park to draw XGames style competition.
  ML: Park tax was 67% of Park budget now is 25%. Value costs. Market the City to wanted retail. Supports G.
  SF: Quoted Dickens, It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Voting for G. Full fiscal review needed. Recruit retail.

  RA: J worked. Need to plan and pursue infill opportunities.
  RR: Strengthen J. There were other options.
  ML: J works, renew it. X failed for many reasons.
  SF: One of the authors of J. Make J permanent now, dont wait.
  LH: Implement the current General Plan. X voted down because of costs, traffic, and housing costs. Make J permanent.

 6. Your take on bike and pedestrian traffic.
  RR: I dont own a car. Bike advocate. Didnt want to narrow 5^th^ street. Doing so would have slowed response times for the fire department.

20060127 02:50:35 nbsp Ive seen Lamar and Rob do karaoke, but never Ruth or Stan, unless they use cunning disguses and secret stage names.  An interesting election indeed. Users/JaimeRaba

20060127 08:14:03 nbsp I dont know about Stan, but based on what Ive observed of Ruth, I dont want her on City Council again.  She is grumpy and not very imaginative. Users/KenjiYamada

20060130 22:18:36 nbsp Davis probably could change its election rule to permit Davis students who have Davis addresses vote regardless of whether they live in Davis territory or not... if they wanted to.  Users/JaimeRaba

20060310 22:44:28 nbsp It would be nice if the candidate websites actually had information on them. The exception being Robs which has detailed information on it. Michael Levys is just annoying because he has the most vague statements about his plans for the city. A balanced budget that supports the services that make Davis special. How incredibly informative!! Users/JonathonLeathers

20060321 00:35:12 nbsp Favorite quote from March 20 Forum: BMX bicycles! The wave of the future!  Rob Roy  Users/SharlaDaly
   Mine was when the mayor stated that the city shouldnt put all of its baskets in one egg. Classic.  Users/JonathonLeathers

20060321 14:36:49 nbsp I think everyone should vote for both Lamar and Rob; platforms aside, I think its important to shake up city council and show that elected local government isnt just for a select caste of Davisites.   Users/JaimeRaba
    20060321 23:31:53 nbsp Amen to that! Paul Harms

20060322 15:59:03 nbsp I would like to say that the nature of the question of choice voting messed me up. I think choice voting would be the best option. The argument for district elections is the cost of the campaign but someone can run a cleverly cheap campaign with choice voting and win a seat as the underdog. It is the best form of voting and Davis is too diversely drawn up for district elections to show a distinct difference of candidates coming from different districts. Users/RobRoy

20060406 14:16:07 nbsp Mike Levy as quoted in the Aggie 4/6/06: Furthermore, he said he envisions a city where Parent Teacher Associations and Little League programs are staffed by parents.  Huh?  Last time I checked these private, noncity organizations were ONLY staffed by parents.  Users/SharlaDaly

    20060407 14:34:37 nbsp Based on your comments, I assume youre an inquisitive young lady unfamiliar with the harships faced by some Davis families.  With both myself and my husband working two jobs trying to get into this overpiced housing market, it means volunteering for any of our kids activities is a luxury we can ill afford.  Thats why I would support candidates who can appreciate the plight of rentors, like Lamar, or even Rob. Users/DavisWikiGnome

        20060407 15:26:41 nbsp Let me first say that Ms. Daly is very familiar with Davis as she is a long time resident of the city and is active in the community. She has attended many a City Council meeting in her day. While I agree that Lamar and myself and more concerned with the plight of the renter than any other candidate I do not see Sharla taking a stance on any candidate on the wiki with the exception of her statement on Mikes page of, If you are happy with the current City Council, this would be the guy to vote for. So yeah, Sharla is very informed.  Users/RobRoy

Meek and Droop for City Council

When electing a City Council (or Board of Education), Davis uses rules, namely, pluralitytakesall, that allow seats won to be grossly disproportional to voter support.

In the Palestinian election of Jan. 25, those rules allowed all five winners in North Gaza to be Hamas candidates even though Hamas received merely 47 percent of the votes there.

A better system is available. Australia has used it for decades and, locally, the ASUCD uses it. The system has several names, the one I like best being Meeks procedure (after Brian Meek, a contemporary English mathematician who, in 1969, ironed out some computational wrinkles). With Meeks procedure, the ballot invites a voter, by marking 1, 2, 3, etc., to rank the candidates  any number of them  in order of preference.

Here is how candidates will fare if we adopt Meeks procedure:

  If any candidate is the first choice (or any two candidates are the top two choices or any three candidates are the top three choices) of more than onethird of the voters when two seats are open, or of more than onequarter of the voters when  two years later  three seats are open, then that candidate (or at least one of those two or three candidates) will win a seat.

  If any two candidates are the top two choices (or any three candidates are the top three choices) of more than twothirds of the voters when two seats are open, or of more than onehalf of the voters when three seats are open, then no fewer than two of those two or three candidates will be elected.

  If any three candidates are the top three choices of more than threequarters of the voters when three seats are open, then all of those three candidates will be elected.

This relation of seats won to voter support seems appropriate and fair. The relation  known as Droop proportionality (after Henry Droop, 183184, an English mathematician who provided some key formulas)  is the primary benefit of Meeks procedure. But, in addition, strategic nominating and strategic voting are likely to become both less frequent and less effective.
