KDRT Poised to Lose its Frequency

Davis, CA  KDRT 101.5 FM, Daviss lowpower community radio station, is facing encroachment from a Gridleybased commercial station known as Sunny 101.5 FM. KDRT, which launched in September 2004, will need to petition the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for another frequency—and fast—to stay on the air, according to station organizers.

In the spring of 2000, Davis Community Television (now known as Davis Media Access) applied for an open slice of radio spectrum as part of the new Low Power FM Radio Service. After a lengthy process, on May 12, 2005, the FCC awarded the newly christened KDRTLP a license to broadcast 83 watts at 101.5 FM. The station has since built a loyal local following and had significant impact on the Davis community.

KDRT is now being threatened with a takeover of 101.5 FM by KMJE. On January 29, 2007, Results Radio, LLC, which owns KMJE Sunny 101.5, applied to the FCC to move from Gridley to Woodland. In its current state, LPFM Service is secondary to fullpower stations, said Jeff Shaw, a DMA staff member and driving force behind bringing KDRT into existence. While this status is not new, on January 19, 2007, the FCC relaxed the rules regarding moveins of full power stations from one community to another, Shaw said. What used to take twothree years now can take as little at 60 days.

According to Autumn LabbeRenault, DMAs executive director, another frequency may not be so easy to come by, and will involve bringing a petition for exemption before the FCC. LabbeRenault said DMAs small staff is busy mobilizing community volunteers to organize a Save KDRT campaign. Well need a broadcast engineer and an attorney to handle the filings, and both of those require money. Its our dedicated volunteers – programmers, engineers, board and committee members – who will make the difference in helping to save this community resource.

Weve worked long and hard to make KDRT relevant and valued, and I know that none of us will sit idly by and watch KDRT disappear, she added. Information about organizing efforts, fund raisers and volunteer opportunities is available at http://www.kdrt.org kdrt.org. Information will be updated as efforts progress.
