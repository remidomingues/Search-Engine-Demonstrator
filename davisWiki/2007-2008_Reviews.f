20070508 16:55:24 nbsp Has anyone ever noticed how Draconian the consignment procedures are at R&R? I walk past there once a week just to read the daily handlettered signs about the Dos and Donts of making a donation. Has the Soup Nazi moved to Davis to run a thrift store? Users/MupDup

20070601 21:14:18 nbsp R&R Consignments is run by a dedicated group of both volunteers and staff who work very hard to accommodate consigners. Unlike a regular retail store which receives stock based on computerized inventory, R&R is often inundated with too much of one particular item (furniture, framed prints, stuffed animals, etc.) With no space to stock them, the quickest and easiest way to let consignors know not to consign them for a while is a handlettered sign. Its a very organic process and appears to suit the consignors well. Volunteers are always welcome and needed to price merchandise, print tags, and tag merchandise. (Perhaps someone could even volunteer to type up some of the handlettered signs, or better yet, donate a message board and a supply of plastic letters.) Dont be shy about looking into volunteering; Judy, the store manager, is the complete polar opposite to the Soup Nazi! Users/TwoCansMom

20070603 19:30:19 nbsp After consigning there quite a few times, I am suspicious that someone who volunteers or works there is taking my things. All of my items are either new with tags or like new, designer/high quality, pefect condition, instyle items, and when I look in the store I never see them in there anywhere, but they dont show up as sold. In light of all the really horrible, trashy, garbage I do see in there, I cant imagine they would truly be rejected. I had opted to donate the items if they didnt sellwell, Ive learned the hard way. Looks like if I continue to work with R&R, Ill be returning in 29 days to pick up my items, lest they go home as a benefit... :( We could use the money, too. I agree with the other comment about the process being Draconian. It is all very negative. I have a bad feeling and Im looking for other options that help locally as well as generate a little money for my familys needs. Users/retromaude

20070604 14:14:55 nbsp Since R&R started taking a higher percentage of the final sale, I started selling more on eBay for the new with tags designer items I end up with. Also if you have stuff you would like to consign without a lot of hassle and have money in your pocket fast take your stuff to TWRF Creative/Easy Auction Consigment in Mansion Square downtown.

20070813 20:29:19 nbsp I agree with some of the comments I was shocked to read the rules for consigning first they pocket most of the money for the item YOUVE provided but the other rules just seem like a scam. Ive never been to a place that wont tell you upfront if they think your item will sell and they will just TAKE your things as a socalled DONATION if they decide theyre not good enough (isnt that abuse of the word? I mean, isnt a donation supposed to be voluntary!? This sounds more like stealing.) Then, if they deem your donation acceptable but it doesnt sell, you must take it back before they absorb it (this one rule makes sense as they wouldnt have room for things to hang around indefinitely.) However the whole system is suspicious theres no tracking of your stuff and its wide open for abuse (ie, stealing) as alluded by previous posters. To be a legitimate business, they need to evaluate your items onsite while you stand there giving back what they dont want, and keeping what they do want to sell (in a trackable fashion so things dont disappear.) Im all for supporting good causes and agree that splitting the proceeds is expected (no more than 5050 though), but this system is set up to abuse consignors. I will not be taking my clothes there as intended. Users/Joanna

20070918 23:27:02 nbsp Please do not waste your time to be volunteer over there. I am not gonna say a lot. Just, do not be volunteer for themplease try find volunteer job somewhere else. Users/SoMeOnE

20070919 21:09:28 nbsp Its shocking how much theft occurs in the consignments office. I cant even tell you the number of times I have brought in brand new items (often with tags, always in season, in perfect condition) and then failed to see them ever hit the sales floor (or to see a penny hit my account). Im convinced that whoever logs items into the computer volunteers for that job because they get first pick for themselves without any system of accountability. Its also all too convenient that they can reject unpressed items  really easy for them to find an item with a single wrinkle (come on people, this is a THRIFT shop) and decide the item is unacceptable  and again a target for office theft. I wouldnt trust these folks with my castoffs. theres an honest, excellent consignment store in St. Helena that gives you a much higher cut of the profits that runs a clean operation. Users/Calvin

20071011 15:20:02 nbsp Ive had similar experiences happen to me at R&R. Reading this makes me feel glad that its not just me. Id bring in items that are name brand, in season, very good to excellent condition only to not find them on the floor nor to see money in my account. Its very suspect and dishonest especially for a not for profit organization. Call it a donation store if youre not going to put my clothes out on the floor; dont hide behind the consignment window. Users/DebWestergaard

20080712 08:33:15 nbsp I was going to take them some things today but after reading their rules, no way. Also, I have clothing that would not pass for resale but may be worth recycling, like how old bluejeans are recycled into wall insulation. Do we have anything like that locally? Users/Renngrrl

20080816 14:42:48 nbsp What a great place to sell, donate & shop. I love it here. You can find the best stuff while donating to a fantastic cause. This is a gem in Davis! Users/jwendt

20080816 14:52:28 nbsp From the customer end, its not too bad, but it varies.  I needed some work boots for an internship I was doing but didnt want to spend a lot of money on new work boots (which generally cost a lot) so I came here hoping to find something.  Out of sheer luck,  I found some really nice looking, very sturdy black work boots that were my exact size.  Best $15 I spent! Users/SunjeetBaadkar
