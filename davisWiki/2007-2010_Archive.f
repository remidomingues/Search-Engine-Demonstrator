Old comments from Users/CovertProfessors page:


20070403 22:48:50 nbsp Welcome to the wiki. Im glad you decided to join as there are not nearly enough professors on here. As it is right now, the wiki seems to be dominated by undergraduates. Users/WilliamLewis

 20070403 22:56:04 nbsp Thanks!  Yes, it is good for me to hear the undergraduate perspective, but I agree that more voices are needed.  (Hey, if youre out there, join in!) Users/CovertProfessor

20070416 10:06:15 nbsp I totally agree with William plenty of profs read the wiki but their contributions are regrettably scarce. Ill definitely check out the tuna melt next time Im at Fuzios and the muffins at village bakery. BTW, if you want to maximize the number of people who read your reviews, I recommend you put them on each restaurants pages. Right now, your visibility is limited to (achem) wiki gnome wiki gnomes, or people who have seen your link on the dental fraud and faculty pages.  Users/CraigBrozinsky

 20070416 11:41:41 nbsp Well, glad the gnomes are stopping by, anyway.  :)  I suppose Ive been torn about just how visible I want to be (I am covert, after all), but then again, theres no point in my doing a lot of work if hardly anyone is going to see it.  (And I wont motivate other profs to join in if I am too covert).  I think Id like to keep my restaurant reviews all together for now, but maybe Ill increase my visibility if I put a link on the Restaurants page.  And really, I should be commenting on some professororiented things.  Im open to suggestions for places where that might be useful. Users/CovertProfessor

  20070416 13:38:04 nbsp For professororiented input, a couple pages that come to mind are UC Undergrad Neglect and UCD classroom etiquette. As for the restaurant reviews, you could have them both on the restaurant page and your own with a little cutting & pasting! : ) Users/LillianChow

    Thanks  those are all good suggestions.  It might take me awhile, but Ill get crackin. Users/CovertProfessor

20070502 22:55:06 nbsp Awesome reviews, keep up the good work, one day I will figure out a way to determine who you are, just to take your class. Users/DavidPoole

 Thanks!  :)  Of course, Id love to have you in my class, but not if I have to blow my cover.  Just take classes that youre interested in, and maybe youll stumble on me anyway...  Users/CovertProfessor

20070503 03:10:09 nbsp Nice reviews added yesterday; I like the specifics. Users/JabberWokky

 Thanks.  I think specifics are very important for restaurant reviews, because every restaurant that is in business will have some people who like it.  So, it helps to know what a person does, or does not, like about a restaurant.  Then the reader can decide if that is something that is important to him/her. Users/CovertProfessor

20070503 14:00:25 nbsp The Wiki does, indeed, seem to be heavily undergraduateoriented, but there are a few like me who throw in the occasional thing, and Im not even associated with the University. Anyway, good to see your entries here.  Users/DanLawyer

 Good to see yours, too.  The wiki should reflect the community.  Users/CovertProfessor

 The top editors, accounting for a heavy percentage of edits, are not undergrads.  The top ten editors have a percentage appropriate for the town.  Id say that the wiki has a heavy undergraduate orientation because Davis has a heavy undergraduate orientation.  Its sort of like having the Las Vegas wiki being gambling oriented; if it werent, it wouldnt reflect the actual city.  Having seen the wiki operate for a few years now, I can say that were coming into summer, when the edits slow and the nonstudent editors tend to stand out a bit more. Users/JabberWokky

  Makes sense to me.  I havent been here long enough to get a sense of Davis as a whole, anyway.  But the wiki has really eased that process, for which I am grateful.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070509 15:40:48 nbsp In my opinion a salad should only complement the main entree, and I dont like salads that are presented as meals. I love iceberg lettuce for the very reason that it has no nutritional value  whatever happened to eating food for enjoyment instead of nutritional value? Excepting the lettuce comments I like this page a lot. Users/TusharRawat

 I also am not a big fan of the salad as meal, although they seem to be all the rage.  And your point about eating food for enjoyment is welltaken.  I cant say that too many of the tasty desserts that I eat are good for me. I guess I never thought about people eating iceberg lettuce for pleasure  I had more in mind people thinking they were eating something healthy, when in fact they are (from a nutritional point of view) eating a bowl of salad dressing.  But for those like you who eat iceberg lettuce for pleasure  more power to you!  Users/CovertProfessor

  Actually iceberg lettuce is a good source of Thiamin, Vitamin B6, Iron and Potassium, and a very good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Folate and Manganese. On a 5 star rating system (of health value) by nutritiondata.com iceberg lettuce recieved 5 stars (as did most nonstarchy vegetables).  Yes it may not have the most nutrients out of all the lettuces, but to say it has no nutritional value is actually just perpetuating a myth. My nutrition major freinds gringe whenever someone makes this type of statement.  However, its not your fault because it has been perpetuated by the media and even well educated people in the medical field. However, i do not perfer iceberg, since i thing it is not as flavorful as other greens.  But sometimes its nice when you just want something crisp and fresh.  By the way the best advice for eating vegetables, is eat the rainbow, very the types of veges as much as you can.  Pretty much all veges are good for you, even iceberg. Users/MattHh
   You really need to consider portion size. Lettuce, iceberg or not, is mostly water, and though it may have big benefits in a salad sized portion, it doesnt make a big dent nutritionally if you plop a single leaf on a burger. A leaf of iceberg lettuce fulfills fewer than 3% of your daily dietary in all categories with the exception of Vitamin K (5%). In contrast, the equivalent amount of potato chips have about half as much vitamin K and are a better source of crunchy deliciousness. Users/CraigBrozinsky
   Ok, guilty (of perpetuating a myth) as charged!  I checked into it and you are right  iceberg lettuce does have some nutritional value, although much less than most other lettuces.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070619 17:30:23 nbsp thanks for the feedback, CP. Although the crisp text and rough bike was an intentional juxtaposition, maybe a change is for the best. Users/EliseKane

20070620 13:20:27 nbsp thanks for helping with the links to the Blue page! Users/JessicaRockwell

20070629 18:29:29 nbsp I agree with you about being against moving all Sacramento based pages from Davis Wiki. Something is lost indeed.  I proposed a http://daviswiki.org/Sacramento_Restaurants/Talk?actiondiff&version211&version19 solution that I hope most people would agree satisfies everyone.  Users/EdWins

Its not me deleting anything, I only edit my page and pages that apply to the community. I actually constantly refer other people to other sitters quite frequently as I am swaped most of the time. Sorry for the confusion ,but look elsewhere for the culprit. Users/ElizabethBarthel
  As Users/WilliamLewis pointed out, there is http://daviswiki.org/Pet_Sitting?actiondiff&version221&version120 evidence that youve deleted competitors names from the wiki. Users/CovertProfessor

   I only edited the page a couple of times and deleted by mistake at first and once on purpose, I wanted to do some research from people to find out the validity of the new students business and whether or not I could look to her as a referral because I believe other students should help students. I have since referred people to lone roan pet sitting and sorry this had to happen it will not happen in the future. As far as the comment about the dirty house and such there is only one case and they had a dog and cat(hearsay as far as i am concerned) please address all future comments to me directly and not on the business page if you please i will answer them and if you still feel the need to make comments then i or you can addd them to the page. Thanks for your advice, i have learned a valuable lesson

20070717 11:06:59 nbsp Howdy,

Its actually accepted practice on Davis Wiki for individuals to do what they please with their own userpages.  So, Elizabeth Bartel was acting reasonably when she removed the comment(s) from her own page.  That doesnt apply to her pet sitting page, of course, since its the communitys page about her service and not a page owned by her.

That said, thanks for helping to keep the wiki contents legit. Users/GrahamFreeman

20070802 14:35:06 nbsp Hi Covert professor I am Leonardo Fasulo owner of Osteria Fasulo in West Davis I saw you question about the patio and bringing dogs , we welcome dogs and my customers love it and i was thinking of having a dogs night out,hope to see you soon, Leonardo Users/LeonardoFasulo

20070804 09:55:28 nbsp zogm anyone who doesnt have a dog can be crossed off the list of potential CPs... Users/StevenDaubert
  Hmm... Or, I have a friend with a dog... Users/CovertProfessor P.S. What is zogm?
      ZOMG is a bastardization of the Internet shorthand term for Oh My God, OMG. The term is commonly used to express humorously overwrought excitement
       That is a good definition... notice how OMG is misspelled to further the sense of excitement? Damnit CP, dont point out the logical failings of my attempt to cull potential CP...  Users/StevenDaubert
        I got some minor lulz out of this whole exchange. :)  Users/WilliamLewis
        Zoh my god, its hard for old farts like me to keep up!  (Does that cull potential CPs, too  or are all Ps old farts?)  But I wouldnt be very covert if I let slip too much relevant info.  :) Users/CovertProfessor
        Or your admission could be subterfuge in and of itself. Aha! Didnt think wed catch on to that, did you? Users/KevinChin

20070817 11:10:25 nbsp You are a hamburgerlinking maniac!!  Nice job. Users/JabberWokky
 Thanks!  And Ive been psyched to see the edits that others have made to the page  its even better now.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070818 11:54:45 nbsp You know, when I left that note about the photo on the hamburgers entry, the thought went through my head Ill bet CovertProfessor uploads a photo. Users/JabberWokky
 Well, how could I resist?  My first Davis Wiki photo, too, although I neither took the picture nor ate the burger (next time)!  Users/CovertProfessor

20070827 16:44:06 nbsp Hi CovertProfessor, welcome to Davis! Im going into my final year at UC Davis and have had a few years to try out the Davis food scene. Im biased because I currently serve there as one of my two jobs, but it seems you have had bad experiences with Japanese food in Davis and urge you to come to Zen Toro (I was a weekly regular before I started working there). If price is a concern try us out during lunch we have some good lunch combinations priced from $7$10, and if you have some more moolah to spend, try out some of the nigiri or specialty rolls (three is a good number for two people). For rolls, in order of preference I recommend the SSC, Lobster Roll, AvoNegihama, Ocean Kings, and Stuart, and our customers seem to like the ZT Crunch, Tataki Attack, Citrus Breeze, and New Age Bake California. As for entrees try the Hawaiian Kalbi Ribs, the Loco Moco, or Grilled Saba. If like many people on the wiki you desire offthemenu items, try the Seafood Chazuke (rice and assorted sashimi with a special broth poured over it). PS  we make our own teriyaki sauce (it seems like bad teriyaki sauce is your pet peeve). Users/AlvinTsao
  Thanks for the recommendation  see my review above.  And yes, I did like the teriyaki sauce!   Users/CovertProfessor

20070828 16:08:47 nbsp Tucos does allow dogs on the patio. At least, they did when I worked there.  Users/ElleWeber
 Thank you! Users/CovertProfessor

20070830 23:14:03 nbsp Nice job splitting the Best Western pages. Users/WilliamLewis
  Thanks.  This was something I found confusing when I first came to Davis, so I thought it might help others to split the entries.  And you are right, we should keep the plain Best Western page with just the links.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070830 23:45:15 nbsp Could you tell us what department your in, or at least a general field (ie. physcal/math science, soc science, engineering, humanities, bio science, medical/health science etc.) Im just currious, you dont have to answer if you think that will give your identity away. Users/MattHh
  Isnt it obvious?  :)  Users/CovertProfessor
   Um. . . Food Science & Technology? Viticulture and Enology? . . . Dogs Vet med?  Ninjutsu? Users/KevinChin
    Hi! Out of curiosity, not trying to offend you, but how do we really know youre a professor?  A couple of my housemates and I were just having a conversation the other day and we thought you have quuuuite a bit of time to edit the Wiki so much as a professor! AmyLee
      Amy, youre right, you dont know  you can believe me or not, and it doesnt really matter to me one way or the other.  Youre absolutely right, though, that I tend to spend more time here than is good for me.  But I have always been this way... I work a little bit, I play a little bit, I work a little bit... its all on the computer, so its just a matter of switching from one app to another.  If I wasnt wasting time on the wiki, Id find someplace else to do it.  Small anecdote: As a high school student and a beginning undergraduate, I always thought that I had lousy study habits.  Then I took a psychology of education class, and read about a study that claimed that studying for hours on end was actually not a good way to learn; that your brain needs time off (say, every 20 mins or so) for things to sink in.  Whether that study was correct or not, and whether that applies now that I am writing, preparing lectures, etc., I dont know  but its my story and Im sticking to it.  :)  Users/CovertProfessor

20070905 21:37:46 nbsp I believe it was necessary to out Talia because she was abusing her wrongly assumed anonymity to try to get revenge on the person who pushed her out at the Aggie. Talia has nothing to fear from Kacey at this point because she is not and has never been Kaceys underling. Of course, the childishness of her actions today could have adverse effects on her career should they reach a wider audience, but thats her own doing. You, on the other hand, arent abusing your anonymity and have no reason to fear losing it. If someone did out you, Id be the first person to bug Philip to memoryhole the edit. Users/WilliamLewis

20070905 22:29:37 nbsp thank you for helping. Users/JessicaRockwell

Covert Prof I edited the comment because 1) I am no longer a davis police officer, and 2) the paragraph is pejorative and implies that I directed threats of bodily harm to persons, which is not true. :) Hope youre enjoying Davis! Its a lovely town, really. Users/CameronMenezes

20070912 23:39:33 nbsp Hi CP Users/StevenDaubert

20070914 11:26:22 nbsp Hi CP.  Im a professor too, new to Davis this year.  I appreciate the restaurant rundown.  Im a native Californian previously stranded in the Midwest for 6 years, so one of the things that drew me to Davis was the many ethnic food options.  Its a bit overwhelming, though.  I laughed out loud at your initial experience of Plutowalked in and walked out again, completely daunted by the customer interface and the tyranny of choice.  I did exactly the same thing a month ago before finally trying it out.  Glad to know I wasnt alone!    Users/CynthiaCCC

20070921 11:15:47 nbsp i totally understand about not wanting to subject your dog to sitting alone in a cage.  if youd like to give it one more try, you might try making an 8am appointment (the store opens at 9, but the grooming dept. opens at 8, just knock on the doors and theyll let you in), try an evening appointment or ask the groomers when a lowvolume time/day is so that you can minimize the amount of time your dog has to sit in a cage.  or just give in to the joys of grooming your own dog.  its fun for everyone!  water and fur everywhere! ;)   Users/JennSuzuki
 Thanks, Jenn, those are good suggestions.  For now, were giving Fo Paws a try.  Ill post my experiences here once weve been there a few times and can really judge them.  So far, they seem like a better option for us because its a small place where, even if the dog has to be in a cage, it is not by itself (the people are right there where the dog can see them and the people can talk to them).  I should also acknowledge that Petcos setup might be less of an issue for a dog that was OK on its own in a cage, but not all dogs are used to that.  And if Fo Paws doesnt work out, we can try going back to Petco and get the early or late appointment, as you suggested.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070925 11:38:05 nbsp Thanks for moving the Dos Coyotes stuff to another page.  That was a lot of well, pointless discussion. Users/BrentLaabs

 Looks like its gone now.  Good riddance.  Users/CovertProfessor

20071014 20:30:27 nbsp Sorry, I should have looked at it more carefully. The only explanation I can think of is it was a joke about parking at the Post Office,  Toad Hollow Dog Park Toad Hollow, or the gravel lot behind the Post Office and walking across Pole Line or through the tunnel (which is actually something I have wanted to try someday). Weird. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 Ah, yes, I think youre right  it must have been a joke.  Well, if you can think of some other way to spell out the connection between Toad Hollow Dog Park and Toad Tunnel, go for it!  Users/CovertProfessor

20071110 13:43:44 nbsp What type of dog do you have? Users/EdWins
  :(   Alright, what dog group is yours? (Hound, terrier, toy, etc). I actually am curious, since youve mentioned the dog in so many edits but maybe dont want to be too specific.  My girlfriend has a little Sheltie (a picture is on my page), but we never really had the opportunity to take her around Davis.
   I think hes in the nonsporting group?  Not sure, Im not too up on these things.  Anyway, you should take your gfs very adorable Sheltie out and about!  Davis is pretty dogs dogfriendly as these things go... lots of restaurants with outdoor seating, a fair number of dog parks/runs, nice walking paths on the greenbelt and the arboretum. Users/CovertProfessor

20071114 09:19:00 nbsp Replying to a rather old comment you left on Town Wildlife, Town Wildlife is for wild animals like Bats, Town Flora is for emus and other domesticated animalsFootnote(Of course, maybe I missed a thundering herd of wild emus that lives in front of Plutos. That would be cool!).  Some, like Turkeys, are both wild and domesticated and thus there is overlap.  There is also Wiki Animals, which are companion animals of a variety of species. Users/JabberWokky
  If thats the intent, then maybe we just need to fix the pages.  I think having coyotes and deer on the Town Fauna was one of the things that threw me off.  As for the Town Wildlife page  are there any wild chickens in Davis?  Maybe Ive just missed them!  Rabbits, I guess, are reasonably on both pages, along with turkeys (as you mentioned).  Frogs, snakes, toads, turtles, and lizards all could be on both, but theyre just on Wildlife.  Snails, too.  But that just increases the duplication, so...   Users/CovertProfessor
   Fauna and flora are the animals and plants of a region, which to me at least implies the animals and plants that naturally occur in the area. So, fauna seems to be an incorrect title for a page of domesticated animals. Users/JimEvans
  Please see {{{Town Wildlife/Talk}}}  I started a formal discussion about renaming them.

One of our customers turned us on to your comments when she brought her furry best friend in for a spa treatment today.

20071124 09:15:01 nbsp excellent point about the burn out. But generally for me, I lower scores because im constantly comparing the restaurants to eachother. For example, i originally did not like Guads, but lately ive enjoyed them very much. to remedy this in my ratings i lowered other mexican restaurants scores and raised guads. Probably the best example of my score lowering comes about a couple months ago when i drastically lowered every japanese restaurant in davis by 12 points. I noticed that the scores were too high in comparison to the other cuisines (considering that the japanese food here is not done very well in my opinion). So generally i lower scores because I am constantly comparing the restaurants to eachother. I generally lower more often because there is a lot more room there. If i allready give a good restaurant an 8, and i think they are about 2 points better than any other restaurant, and ive allready given the other restaurants a 7. There is much more room for lowering the other restaurants than increasing the good one. Users/MattHh

I got to the chinese section and I noticed there was no writeup on Hometown Chinese Restaurant! Hometown is located at the south davis chevron, and it may take some time to get your food during busy dinner hours, but dont let either of those deter you from giving the place a shot ( You can also call ahead to place your order for pickup ). You may also want to give Zen Toro a try  good sushi, clean presentation and a decent selection of rolls you will likely not see in other sushi restaurants. Users/rgysel

20071208 13:43:58 nbsp hi. so a few things. 1) it was obvious to me your comment was sarcastic. 2) you should come to the Wiki BBQ Jan 2008. 3) you may or may not find this interesting, but people refer to you as he. i dont know your gender, and neither do these people. so why are they referring to you as male? its totally contradictory when these people claim to see no gender online but then turn around and use gendered pronouns. a few times they have defended their use of he by saying that the things youre writing somehow show youre a male. i dont know what it is. is it your style of writing? the topics you choose? or the fact that 70% of daviswiki editors are male so based on probability youre a male? anyhow, i found this amusing and thought it should be shared.  Users/JessicaRockwell
  If you do show up, dont feel pressured to decovertizise yourself, which honestly may be difficult being that professors are a bit rare on the wiki.. maybe you should get many more professors to join the wiki or come up with a clever disguise? ~Dave
   Jessica, even worse  do they assume I am male because they see professor and think man?  Anyway, thank you for the invitation to the wiki bbq.  But as Dave says, Id probably end up decovertizing myself, and Im not sure I want to do that.  Though I do wonder, Dave  is it really so obvious who the professors are?  I mean, not all of us walk around with sport coats with patches on the elbows and a pipe.  (Does anyone do that anymore??)  Users/CovertProfessor
     I keep threatening to get Sarah a pipe when she joins a faculty.  She already has the coat with patches.  Actually, given our sense of humor, I probably will give her one. By the way, I think Ive used he before just due to the constraints of language, but Id not be surprised at all either way: I actually picture you as a fuzzy bust silhouette.  Seriously.  White background, dark gray fuzzy outline from the midchest up.  Im not sure if thats an improvement over assumption of gender, as I seem to have mentally pegged you as a tenebrous nonhuman.

  It just so happens that the other night we thought our dog might have a serious problem  thankfully, it turned out not to be.  But it made me realize that I should have the emergency info at hand (duh).  Well, it took me awhile to find it, which was disturbing.  So, I hope I can help someone else out by making it easy to spot.   Users/CovertProfessor

20071214 22:38:11 nbsp Ha!  I plead distraction due to looking for the correct Vet Med entry while riting what I rote their.  ;)  On a more sober note, Im glad your dog wasnt seriously ill.  Your scare may well have prompted revisions that will help another animal in need of emergency care.  Somebody with a sick animal at 2am is likely not going to be in the frame of mind to do leisurely research looking for help.  I hope that a more than one pin on the map system goes into place fairly soon, as it would be a good idea to map the parking as well. Users/JabberWokky
  I agree.  I tried to figure out an address for the place to map it properly, but I dont think that UCD buildings have distinct addresses?  Or, if they do, I couldnt figure one out for the Vet Med Center.  So, linking to the campus map was the best thing I could think of.   Users/CovertProfessor

Ive seen many profs working very very long hours up until they get tenure.  How long does tenure take to achieve?  What makes someone well qualified for tenure?  What makes them unqualified?  Is it all about being able to bring in funding?

  I dont think its so out of character.  Yes, I like to eat out, and I try my best to be fair in my restaurant reviews.  But I am deeply disturbed by these uniforms.  To me they reinforce the idea of women as cute and subservient, and I think it is selling food through sex appeal.  Of course, there is a place for women to dress in these kinds of clothes, but its not in the workplace.  I find it particularly disturbing that it is young women who are wearing the uniforms, just at the age when they should be taking themselves seriously and thinking about the contributions that they will make to the world.  I think its bad for the employees themselves and bad for the image of women in general.  This is a university town and we ought to know better.  Some people think my view is outdated  well, I look at some of the things that have happened in the recent election, and regardless of what one thinks about Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin, it cant be denied that both struggled to be taken seriously.  I realize that the employees are probably freely choosing to wear these uniforms and may like them.  But women make choices that are harmful to themselves and to other women all the time, so this would be nothing new.

 Ask yourself this: does Sagat wear the uniform?  Id be surprised to learn that she did.  And if not, why not?  Would people take her seriously?

 I think if you look back at the edits Ive made on this wiki, I have taken strong stands on a number of issues.  I never do so lightly.  So, what sort of person would I be if I said that this was really important, but then I said, well, but go ahead and eat there, the food is good!  Which is more important, the image of women in society or whether the food at a restaurant is good?

  I think I know what you mean.  Symposiums pizza is, for lack of a better word, a bit more upscale.  Its a richer food.

       For a less inflammatory version of what I meant by countering firearms with firearms, If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you, it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun.  The Dalai Lama, (May 15, 2001, The Seattle Times) speaking at the Educating Heart Summit in Portland, Oregon, when asked by a girl how to react when a shooter takes aim at a classmate. It is a controversial topic...but really, has anyone proved that licensed concealed weapons carriers are equally or more likely to commit crimes with their firearms than members of the general population? I think the general sentiment, as expressed at least by CurlyGirl26 and perhaps others, is that not everyone can be trusted with a firearm, which is exactly right, and is the reason that SCCC is pushing to allow alreadylicensed concealed carriers to be able to carry on campus as well as off, rather than to just completely level the playing field by issuing every John and Jane Doe a gun. The scene from RoboCop 3, with that guy handing out weapons to every  criminal in the jail? Not our aim. Users/BrendanChan
        If thats your position, then you shouldnt go around saying things like: The answer to bullets flying is almost always more bullets flying, if only because it doesnt help your cause, but also because its irresponsible.  Even so, though, I think there is a fairly large leap from If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you, it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun (which I pretty much agree with, though it very much depends on the circumstances) to alreadylicensed concealed carriers should be able to carry on campus as well as off.  I think there are certain conditions on a college campus which make having firearms there particularly problematic.  Ill name two.  First, as any counselor on campus can tell you, college is an extremely difficult time psychologically.  Students are overworked, underslept, and overstressed.  Professors and staff, too.  Not good conditions for people to have guns.  Second, many times there are large numbers of people (read: innocent bystanders) who are present, such as in large lecture halls or the MU.  Im sure youll object by saying that this shows all the more why we need lawful gun carriers to counteract the actions of the unlawful ones  but my point is that adding more guns, wielded by individuals who are already psychologically on edge, in crowded situations, are the last thing that we need.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Well said, CP!  Thank you for pointing out the psychological aspect.  All true.  I have seen otherwise healthy individuals crack under the pressures associated with the rigors of being an undergrad or grad/professional student.  Ive also experienced firsthand what happens when one of those said students has their gun handy.  Their legally owned gun.  My discomfort lies with the fact that we are talking about students and guns on university campuses.Users/CurlyGirl26

20090107 14:40:41 nbsp Actually, having a dog is a requirement for being a professor.  Most people think that you cant get a PhD without completing a dissertation.  And they are right.  But it is also the case that you must have a dog.  Even better if it is a puppy, because you can use that to melt the hearts of the people on your committee.  When you apply to be a professor, the first question they ask you is whether or not you have a dog.  The second one is whether or not it has been trained.  When you get your own lab, you are granted an allowance of grad students to feed to the dog (it is important that the dog remain healthy and strong.)  They would use undergrads, but when grad students get consumed by their...work (yeah, thats it.  They call it work, not dogs), nobody notices if they disappear.  :)

20090130 04:08:43 nbsp In response to the Crepehouse Uni UNIforms...

Sagat does not wear the uniform because she is constantly traveling back and forth between the unit and to various locations all over Davis. For her to wear the uniform, it would be great hassle as she would have to then change about 40 times a day between her casual clothing and the uniform. The uniforms are custom made and they are not made to handle the wear and tear of a casual outfit. Sagat cannot lift heavy boxes and cartons of gelato/milk while wearing the uniform that could quite possibly tear or become dirty. Also, it would not make sense for Sagat to wear the uniform outside of the unit because it would be unsanitary to bring it out in public over multiple trips and then wear it while making crepes or handling food.

Sagat is taken seriously from what I have seen, as she has made many accomplishments and she is a very hard worker. She works diligently to run Crepehouse Uni and she would not force her employees to wear something that she herself would not. If you look at the picture on the Crepehouse Uni page, Sagat is wearing one of the UNIforms. So to say that she does not wear the uniform as a matter of being taken seriously is a total misconception.

  Thanks.  Im glad you (and KellyM) brought the issue up.  I probably would not have ever said anything otherwise, but its worth discussing.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090302 23:23:11 nbsp Hey, Covert.  Ive been wondering for quite some time where the professors disappear to when they are not teaching or researching.  (Not you, specifically.)  I very rarely see professors around the city of Davis itself.  Of course, that could be because I only know a small subset of the professorial population, or it could be because there are so many undergrads running around that they provide lots of obstructions for professors to hide behind.  :)  But I would at least expect to see people in their 30s  70s running around Davis who are likely professors, and I usually dont.  So where are they?  Do they cease to exist after their office hours?  Do they run to random respites when not researching?

The same question also applies to postdocs.  I dont see many of these around either... (of course, there are probably fewer postdocs than professors around to begin with.) Users/IDoNotExist
  Well, Im not sure if the 3070 set who are professors look much different from the 3070 set who arent... but youre right, there are a lot of undergrads around.  Half the population of Davis, in fact.  And then when you add in the children, teenagers, and nonundergrads in their 20s... plus the over 70s.... yeah, so there arent as many in the 3070 set as you might ordinarily find in a town.  But were out here.  We go to restaurants, the farmers market, the greenbelts and arboretum, various Davis festivals and whatnot... but its true, a lot of the time were in our offices or at home, working.  Or, if youre me, on the wiki when you should be working.  :)   But its also true that not all professors live in Davis; there are a lot who live in the Berkeley/Oakland area.  So, if theyre not in lab, in class, or in their offices, theyre probably not in Davis much.  Users/CovertProfessor

20090303 11:15:43 nbsp That would be quite a commute (from Berkeley)... Users/IDoNotExist
  An econ prof I had my freshman year who lived in Berkeley said there was a bus and that the commute allowed her to catch up on reading. wl

20090303 12:14:34 nbsp Is Berkeley a nicer city to live in?  Ive always gotten the impression that it has 3 areas: UC Berkeley, the hills (with very expensive homes), and the flat area, which seems run down, and Id guess is where the students can afford to live. Users/IDoNotExist
  I dont know much about the various neighborhoods to live in.  But I think people like to live in Berkeley because it is a little more urban than Davis and because it is closer to SF.   Users/CovertProfessor

  Thanks, JW.  I do understand why people are annoyed with SV  as someone said already, he raised a number of stinks, got people riled up, and then tries to bail out, leaving a mess in his wake.  But weve let plenty of people delete comments in the past  even when their removal ruined the surrounding conversation (generally, the rest of the conversation was deleted, too).  So, it seemed to me that the gnomes were thinking of either 1) changing to a policy where people could only delete comments if the comments werent part of a conversation, or 2) changing to a policy where people couldnt delete their comments at all (this is the policy that I think would be draconian).  By saying this is about policy rather than this particular case, I am assuming that we would want to be consistent about how future cases were handled.  Anyway, now we seem to be off on a tangent about the CC license, so Im not sure where things stand.  Users/CovertProfessor

I wanted to ask if you have been to other Vietnamese Restaurants outside of Davis? I cannot say either Sunrise or Bac Hoa Viet are good at all. Their food proportions are ridiculous for the prices and although they are owned by Vietnamese people (and the food is cooked by Vietnamese people), the quality or taste of the food is not all very tasty or near authentic to real Vietnamese food.

I would go outside of Davis for some real Vietnamese food. In Sacramento, on the streets of Stockton Boulevard and 65th Street is a great Vietnamese plaza with delicious food. If you happen to go to San Francisco or San Jose, the Vietnamese food there is even better than up here. San Jose has one of the largest Vietnamese populations. Users/missmochi

20090701 15:48:18 nbsp I witnessed the same kinds of things that are listed on the Stonegate page (although I dont believe Ive added to that entry), but I received perfectly fine service.  I think there is some kind of sexism, ageism, studentism or zero tolerance for ignorance or idiocy at play.  Something sets off the owner resulting in zero respect for you and treats you accordingly.  Either that or theres something invisible like a chronic illness resulting in pain flareups or otherwise nonobvious event that affects the owner.  In short, there is really impressively caustic treatment of some customers, although Im not sure exactly what triggers it.  Im hesitant to actually mention it on the page for fear of rampant unsupportable speculation.  Users/JabberWokky
  Hmm, ok  I trust the report from you, JW.  It could be some of both.  Certainly, there is plenty of antistudentism in this town.  I think the bad eggs have made many of  Davisites antistudent.

May I suggest asking me the validity and goals of said Wiki to understand if it is in fact a business that is simply being made aware to the community before assuming that I have similar motives as another individual.  While I seem to be having to defend my integrity without a proper welcome in the first place, let me clear it up by saying that I do not require a lecture from you about how this community functions.  I fully understand the concept and the need for people to be actively involved (by editing entries, commenting, and so on) for DavisWiki to grow.  Furthermore, I am completely aware of the ownership of the page I created and that it belongs to the community as a whole.  There was no reason for you to assume I did not other than your suspicions.  Perhaps next time you can post a proper welcome with links to the appropriate welcome pages in DavisWiki.

20090925 14:08:29 nbsp Wow.  Makes me think that some sort of metamoderation system might be needed for the wiki.  Weve had a rash of users who have a severely negative impact on it lately.

20090925 14:54:37 nbsp Perhaps each time you get reverted by a gnome, you lose the ability to edit for some amount of time.  That time starts very small, but doubles each time.

 Ive got the links up there now for the numbers.  Of course, this doesnt show that 30K of the 65K is students.

Users/CovertProfessor

20090930 02:58:32 nbsp ¬_¬

if you live in the dorms, you live in yolo county. Those census figures would go to yolo county, its just like the trailer park over near research parkway, not in Davis, even though it clearly is. Same thing with el macero. Its not about them being students, its about them not being in Davis. On a different note, 30k includes undergrad and all post grad students or just undergrads alone? Users/StevenDaubert
  Right  read what I wrote above more carefully: students not living in dorms wont be excluded from the census.  As EdWins noted, there are only about 5K students living in dorms.  And yes, the ~30K number includes graduate students (dont they count too??) but I doubt it includes postdocs, since postdocs are not students.   Users/CovertProfessor

20091007 10:42:06 nbsp There is some very good discussion here that would likely be useful to future people seeking answers.  Might I humbly propose some entry similar to Dental Questions, something along the lines of Academia Questions (as opposed to Academic Questions, i.e., this would have to do with the actual process of being in and rising into the world of formal academia, teaching, research, grants, application, etc).  Basically, the process from undergrads looking to get into a PhD program on up (which overlaps a bit with those looking to get a doctorate to pursue industry careers, but that probably makes sense, as I know people who thought they were bound for a industry job who fell into positions in university research groups).  The focus would be on UCD of course, for people passing through UCD as they obtain degrees or questions about UCD within the context of people seeking postdoc and higher positions at UCD.

20091027 23:55:11 nbsp Expanding on Dauberts comment, since you have so many comments and reviews in your page, it might aid navigation if each type of food were listed on a distinct page, or at least if there were a separate page that contained your reviews.  Pages that archive comments by year would also be really helpful in making the comments easy to sort through. Users/IDoNotExist
  Agreed.  Theres no need for rigid homogeneity in the wiki.  Having a Covert Professors Picks would probably be fun, and anybody who wanted to could create their own Picks page... once there were enough, they could be crosslinked as a best of Davis by critic type entry named Picks.  It would move a bit toward busting up the monotony of phone number, dry description, too many reviews that constitutes so much of the wiki these days, add some personality back, and might even prompt some editors to realize they are empowered to build out the wiki beyond what weve already got. jw

20091101 14:33:01 nbsp a camera that shows 1 frame a second in a private business is different than encouraging others to help force an agenda that is misguided.

We dont have AC or heating in our house, but we have a fireplace, you really advocate having us be cold cause we dont ride a heater and chose to find and cure wood that is suitable for burning? Users/StevenDaubert

20091101 14:34:37 nbsp and the webcam thing is just people overreacting, what possible negative things can result from that? People randomly look at you all the time on the street, its the same thing just over the internet and with less refresh Users/StevenDaubert

  I think there are few things more insidious than societys increasing tolerance of the loss of privacy, of which Yolo Berry is yet one more instance.  It will come back to bite us.  It is already biting us (Bush adminstration tactics, not completely ended with Obama administration; see also the UK)
 What I advocate is that we find out whether there is a problem, and then take appropriate action to deal with the problem if one is found.  Appropriate action might include money to help people financially if a wood fireplace is their only source of heating.  Surely you dont think you have the right to harm the health of others for your own heating needs if alternatives are available?  Surely you recognize that living in a society with others requires some restrictions on absolute freedom?  I realize that you dont think there are negative health impacts from fireplaces.  But my point is that we should find out and deal with the situation if there are.  Users/CovertProfessor

20091101 14:45:37 nbsp yeah, pick on homeowners cause they dont have a lobby like truckers. Our energy bill is 30 dollars a month on a 3/2. Fireplaces are such a non problem its disgusting that so much energy is put towards making them the devil.

As far as the yolo berry camera goes, I would love to see how many hits they get on it and how long ips stay connected to the feed. its not in a public corner going straight to the police who can then yell at you thru a loudspeaker ala UK. Worry about the patriot act letting the man look at what books you check out from the library instead of some misguided business owners trying to drum up support in the cutthroat yogurt business of Davis. Users/StevenDaubert
  If I am picking on homeowners, then I am picking on myself.  Were all in this together.  Were all neighbors.  Were going to have conflicts.  If its not going to be allout war, we need to listen to each others concerns and find ways to solve them.  Youre assuming that burning your fireplace is not a health issue.  I love a big roaring fire myself, but I can also tell that it affects my breathing, and I am a healthy person.  I worry about the seniors in my neighborhood.  Again, all I am saying is that this is worthy of study.
 If its on the internet, its at the police station, its at the government; its everywhere.  As for Yolo Berry, they are my favorite yogurt place in town and I frequent them frequently.  Not sure what I will do now that there is a web cam.  But if their customers dont like it  for whatever reason  Yolo Berry should know about it.   Frankly, I think there are better ways that they can compete.  Users/CovertProfessor

20091101 15:39:36 nbsp Wood burning adds soot and other particulates into the atmosphere, along with various greenhouse gases.  Conversion of plants to gases in an unfiltered fire is a good way to contribute heavily to global warming, along with acid rain and smog. The emissions are also potentially very bad for anyone with breathing problems.  If you are taking an action that potentially harms others, then the burden is on you to mitigate it, since other people cant.  Its no different than if you were blasting your stereo in the middle of the night and waking up your neighbors.  While you may benefit from it in musical enjoyment, your neighbors are negatively impacted by it, and you are in a position to prevent them from being impacted at all.

The camera thing is scary for a different reason.  Covert is right.  Once the video is out there, its out there for everyone.  While I really dont think that theres likely to be an issue for someone knowing that someone else bought a chocolate frozen yogurt at Yoloberry (mmm...Yoloberry...), we do have a great example (the UK) of a country where small adjustments to the level of surveillance let to it being essentially impossible for anyone to do anything in the UK without being captured on video.

20091102 09:00:22 nbsp It (surprisingly to me) really upset somebody whom I respect.  They objected to the comment referring to Davis as a small town, which in my mind is a poetic/cultural outlook description more than strict numbers, but to them meant dinky or small in numbers.  The point was more about the location and proximal options than Davis itself.  It was a minor addition, one I didnt really see it as worth debating, so I removed it.  As a side point, it occurred to me that if a sizable university is in any location other than a major metropolis, the surrounding city is always a University town, not a University city.  Something makes just about any municipality with a heavily influential student population a town rather than city.  Its probably similar to boat versus ship or house versus estate  more than just size dictates the appropriate term. Users/JabberWokky

20091102 09:32:40 nbsp Thats probably true for larger cities as well.  Boston is often referred to as a university town (it has at least 5 major ones), but its a big city. Users/IDoNotExist
   DC, Miami and Orlando dont fall into the term... Durham sometimes does.  I think it has more to do with the visibility of the student body within the city, but thats a gut feeling without any significant thought on the subject.

  I have heard too many negative things about the owners of the Mustard Seed  both from people on the wiki and in real life  to want to give them any of my business.  As for Bistro 33, Ive only been there once.  It struck me as not my sort of place  trying a bit too hard to be trendy.  And the food was mediocre and a bit overpriced for what it was.  I never wrote a review, though, because I usually try to visit a place more than once before coming to a definite conclusion.  The patio looks lovely, and for sure Id go there just for that except they require that dogs sit outside the patio, a policy that I dont like.  So, until someone drags me there again, I probably wont go on my own.  But when I do, Ill write a review.  Then again, maybe Ive just written one.  :)   Users/CovertProfessor

The http://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/ Board of Barbering and Cosmetology still has Abella on file in the same location, while Abbas license is new and has the old nail salon address.

20100108 22:57:59 nbsp I agree that the sudden burst of edits raises a lot of suspicion. It does on that page, and on any other where what appears to be a business owner makes a few edits and then suddenly there are a flurry of extremely positive reviews. Keep in mind that some of them may be genuinely independent and honest, but good luck sorting out which are which. Ive been feeling pretty disappointed about a lot of the recent Self Interest Single Topic EditoRs (SISTERs), particularly those editing using organizational account names. When you care for the wiki on an ongoing basis it is hard not to have times when your focus is drawn toward the edits of people who are abusing the wiki either out of ignorance, which is fixable, or an inability to see the wiki as anything other than a tool to their own ends, which is not fixable.
I guess part of my reason for leaving you the first comment about Users/Luther was that it troubles me to see someones early edits reverted without a note being left one their user page. Sort of along the lines that if it is worth taking the time to revert, then it is worth taking the time to welcome and attempt to educate. On the other hand I dont do that on the main Wiki Spot hub wiki because there is less community there and the spammers and people who just dont get what a wiki is for are much less likely to benefit from the effort of trying to reach out and educate.
The recent use of the term Wiki Cops by an upset editor was pretty offensive, and I really liked JabberWokkys response to it. My own reaction is that the use of that term demonstrates a huge lack of understanding about the nature of this wiki. When Im editing here on Davis Wiki Im mostly a librarian in that Im cataloging and fixing links.

20100110 13:21:24 nbsp Those are specifically the places that also sell frozen yogurt.  Im actually planning on going back and doing the Ice Cream places in a moment as well.

20100110 18:02:17 nbsp They should be (and are) crosslinked in their intros, as they are all related.  I think a top level entry for just three categories is a little much, but a {{{desserts}}} entry and even a triple part list on date food (and kids food) might make sense (I think deserts exists... which is why Im linking it.  If it doesnt, it should (edit: it does, under dessert).  Desserts for their own sake fit culturally into a few spheres of activity, like dating, kids and... what else? Users/JabberWokky

20100110 19:28:50 nbsp Now its my turn to be a bit confused... why did you add frozen yogurt and gelato to Dairy Queen... or gelato to Ben and Jerrys?  They only have ice cream and ice cream and yogurt, respectively (as far as I know). Users/JabberWokky

20100110 20:10:20 nbsp Oh, I dont mind either way.  When editing the wiki, other ideas of how to do things are always okay... and if you think this kind of linking makes sense, Ill roll with it.  If you think my way made more sense (just listing the crosslinks for what they actually offer), Ill zip through and fix the entries.  Either way is useful, so Im not terribly concerned.  My only tiny reservation is that it seems to imply that the place offers all three. Users/JabberWokky

20100122 20:56:02 nbsp Part of the reason that Wiki Community/Archiving Comments never got an instructions section is that different people use different naming conventions and structures for archives. So far there isnt one way that emerged as the way to write up. I suppose we could write up the options for each step. Do you think if it were written up clearly that wed see it being abused by archiving any time a negative comment landed on the page followed up by a bunch of suspiciously wonderful comments? Users/JasonAller
  It seems to me that we could just recommend one common and simple way of doing it, and say that variations on that theme have been used.  And emphasize that generally people archive only past years, labeled by year  and that archiving recent comments will likely be reverted, especially comments from the current year.  And selectively archiving comments will almost definitely be reverted, unless were all asleep at the switch.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100209 08:59:56 nbsp Hey, I tried to chop down the Talk page on Real Computers, but was having trouble finding key points on anything remaining.  A few people had voiced their view that the discussion should end soon, so I deleted it.  In part, I deleted it because I knew the people who still might want to discuss anything (like you) have the knowledge of how to go back and pull your last active thread and restate the specific points that are still being discussed.  That last version was a bit all over the map.  In short, I wasnt trying to force an end to the conversation, just a cleanup and refocus, but I wasnt certain enough to be sure Id pick out the relevant points for the people still discussing things, so Im leaving it to the participants.

20100221 10:56:47 nbsp I honestly lost track, as there were a large number of sections on several entries being consolidated, broken out and moved.  I had a pattern I was following to make sure everything was carefully kept, but was unable to maintain the pattern due to crossedits occurring  despite a few pleas to wait until the consolidation was complete.  I currently hold a tentative belief that all points were integrated, but there was actual content editing (not just housekeeping edits that moved things around) while I was trying to split and merge, which destroyed the clear trail I was trying to establish.  At one point I had a text editor with sorted and grouped blocks that I was adding back to the entries (cutting, so the text file emptied out as the content went back into the wiki).  To add to the confusion, at one point there was a server reload, which caused at least one edit to be lost.  Im pretty darn certain I caught that one and placed it back.  I wound up just quickly dumping in what I had (so it was at least vaguely in place), adding one point and then declaring that I was abstaining from editing, as someone had to back off to prevent the chaos from multiple editors working at cross purposes.  I actually would have backed off much earlier (and just returned after a few hours or a day) rather than pushing forward so aggressively, except that I had actual content that was in midmove and had already been deleted from the wiki.  Those large structural moves, especially when youre splitting or merging content, do poorly when they occur at the same time the content itself is being actively edited.  I had thought there was a pretty clear group agreement to make the changes, and did not expect editing to occur (or a server reload!) while I was making them.  Part of it is that foo is a novice and enthusiastic editor who was a little zealous about very quickly correcting the mistakes I was making as I grouped blocks of related content together, much of which duplicated each other in different wordings (as is typical when you merge similar entries and want to have all versions in the new entrys history).  If anything was lost, I dont think it was significant or unique, and there is now a (hopefully) more consolidated and useful set of entries to press forward with.  The next step I envision as follow up will be to go through and either delete the Talk page or at least cut it way down by eliminating the discussion rendered moot by the changes that were made.  I wanted to leave it for a day or two rather than just zeroing it out right after the changes that had been discussed occurred. Users/JabberWokky

20100305 09:10:59 nbsp Just to be clear, I agree with you about the policy points and I agree that we do need to get the administrators on our side (although UCOP is far more vital there than Mrak).  My objection is to the actual protest that occurred yesterday, not to its supposed goals.  No matter how you frame the objective, what they did was counterproductive.  Theyre only going to alienate administration of all levels, theyre going to make the UC and its students look bad in Sacramento and throughout the state (i.e. to the voters), and theyre harming thousands of students education, ostensibly in the name of protecting higher education.

If this were a sane, vandalismfree protest that was rationally related to its goals, I would support it 100%.  But just because I agree with the ends doesnt mean Im going to sit back and ignore the means. Users/TomGarberson

20100308 00:01:14 nbsp I guess if I look at it as practice in hopes of figuring out how to protest in ways that arent so counterproductive I can be a bit more optimistic about it.  I dont know enough about what goes on between the UCD administration and Sacramento to say much about it, other than that I strongly suspect Oakland has far more influence than does Mrak.  If it were local plus Sac and UCOP, that would certainly alleviate one of my concerns.  Thats still just one among many, though.

Its also probably true that many protests are ruined by just a couple of bad actors.  Thats something that needs to be taken into account when planning these things, though.  If youre going to go that avenue, you dont get a free pass on foreseeable consequences just because your intentions are good.  Im not a fan of negligence any more than I am of shirking personal responsibility. Users/TomGarberson
  The protests did include Oakland + Mrak + Sac.  Its just that weve only covered the local protests in our wiki page.  I suspect youre right that protests need to be planned  perhaps deciding on which routes and actions to take ahead of time.  But theres no telling when a crowd might become a mob with a mind of its own.  As I said, though, you and I agree on almost everything.  Im mainly reveling in the students taking any kind of action. Users/CovertProfessor
   The Oakland protest was City Hall and 880, not, as far as Im aware, UCOP.  Why they went to City Hall in a city that doesnt even host a UC campus when just down the road there was the actual administration for the entire university I couldnt say.  And yeah, Im glad that there was a decent sized group at Sacramento.  I guess that does fit the bill somewhat, although I still maintain that it was poorly planned and poorly executed. tg

        Like splitting out the causes at the start?  :P  I have a feeling in a few weeks, there will be another opportunity for a more sedate and specific growth of information that can be better organized into a cohesive and multiperspective whole.  I actually have some thoughts and questions on the whole subject, but am waiting for things to die down.  I also have the common questions that I ask in all these undergrad oriented subjects: how is it affecting grads/postdocs/faculty/administration/facilities/etc?  How distinct are the med and law schools in this situation?  And so on, all around the elephant.  There is a reasonable first focus on the largest group of people, but if the situation for other segments of the university isnt recorded here while it is fresh in peoples minds, it will be buried in history, as news media isnt focusing on anything but the situation for undergrads either. I know of at least one person who spent some time talking to the guy who had to clean up the graffiti so that his perspective could be added to the wiki.

20100310 10:22:11 nbsp Perhaps there is a difference between what people mean when they use the term disrupting.  Missing some classes to ponder the position of education in society is a wonderful thing, especially on a college campus when that form of open thought and dialog should be encouraged.  Blocking people from getting to the hospital or jeopardizing somebodys research is a different type of disruption.  Going up a level to other protests, I think most people would say that sparking an armed conflict with fatalities is too far.  This protest fell somewhere between a clearly good thing (more than peaceful public discussion) and a clearly bad thing (less than serious injury), and I think some of the disagreement is based on what people are envisioning when they hear disruption is good.  The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was a disruption, and so was the protest of the Bath School property taxes.  One had a quarter million people peaceably assembling and changing history.  The other was one guy killing or maiming nearly a hundred kids and educators.  Disruption as a simple word without clarification is probably a dangerous thing to toss around in a discussion of protests without clarification of the nature of disruption you are referring to, especially when there are people arguing that any amount of disruption for an extended period of time is needed while lauding groups that encouraged open display of firearms during protests and others that fire rockets into populated towns.  I am fairly confidant that you are not talking about that level of disruption, but possibly rather something more toward the voluntary peaceable assembly that disrupts by being a visible and vocal icon of an issue and drawing people into altering their normal routine to think and discuss that issue (with what does it take to be visible? being answered with a pretty wide spectrum of action).  Note that none of this really argues anything other than for a clarification of a word that appears to have radically different connotations to different people in the discussion.  (And as a personal postscript, any position that this appears to argue for is purely accidental; I used extreme or distantly related examples to attempt to avoid a particular bias toward any particular set of connotations.  My personal beliefs would probably be considered very fringe). Users/JabberWokky

  It seems to me that some event or action is a disruption if it prevents or delays some activity, service, access, or anything else that would normally be possible without that event or action.  In the case of the stuff here, it becomes disruptive if people who do not wish to participate in a protest can not accomplish whatever they need to do as a result.  For example, if someone wanted to go to class but could not reach it because of a protest, then the protest is being disruptive.   Users/IDoNotExist
  I agree that there are disruptions and Disruptions.  Its hard to imagine a protest that wasnt at least somewhat of a disruption, given that there is a crowd of people being very loud.  People may have trouble getting around the crowd, or be hampered in doing activities that require quiet.  But I agree that there should not be Disruption, putting peoples lives in jeopardy (closing I80 falls in this category) or preventing them from making principled choices such as continuing their lab research.  It is always possible, though, that a crowd could inadvertently cause Disruption... but thats true of a concert or a ball game, too.  (One reason why I dont like crowds).  cp

Thats not counting all the edits to the page itself and all of the talking that went on on the user pages.  Its not that Im so attached to the current wording as it is that I dont want to see anything set that off again  for example, the new link to the comics page.  Feelings are still very raw on all sides.  The current wording is good enough and I think it is should stay more or less as it is for awhile.  Please consider this as a personal request.   cp

20100313 12:33:22 nbsp As a side note, Premier is a title, an official designation on Droms and should be capitalized.  Removing the bold and all caps was a good edit, IMO. Users/JabberWokky
  Yeah, Im fine with Premier, but not PREMIER.  cp

20100313 13:57:57 nbsp When someone isnt logged in and they see a page with a mailto macro, the email address is displayed as user AT domain DOT tld (as an antispam measure). When someone is logged in, the address is displayed as user@domain.tld and the address is a mailto link. The antispam measure thing is pointless these days, as just about any scraper in the world will replace AT with @ and DOT with .

20100314 21:05:12 nbsp Hey, I cant find the Enterprise article.  Do they now say that a taser was actually fired?  They said early on that one was used in drive stun mode (like a cattle prod, different than firing one to incapacitate).  Normally it wouldnt matter, but theres been so much swirling uncertainty, it would be good to make the specifics clear. Users/JabberWokky

20100314 22:45:32 nbsp Okay, so far it seems fair to note at least three points: the stated reason for CHPs internal disconnect, the differences between uses of a taser and the delay in the correction until after the media coverage. (I assume William is reading this as well, and will chime in.  He seems to have clarified the second point already). Users/JabberWokky
  Agreed, assuming an Oxford comma.  cp
    That is an accurate assumption, although the AP style guide is a more accurate description.  I have been in the news publishing field for about 14 years, and even if youre not an actual writer the commas and title case eventually permeates your brain.  In casual writing (e.g. wiki chatter) my comma use is hideous anyway.  Add to that my overuse of semicolons and ellipses and its amazing Im not accused of being a bad William Carlos Williams fan who uses random punctuation rather than white space.   jw
     You should get that looked at.  Failure to do so may result in complications, requiring a semicolonoscopy, or even leave you commatose.  Users/IDoNotExist
     My grammar is far from perfect, but Oxford commas are second nature to me both as a reader and a writer.  I had to read your sentence twice to see that it contained three items.  Re: semicolon use, you should read the most recent John Irving novel.  :)  cp
       I had thought there might be an interesting story as to why journalists and authors diverged in grammatical standards.  Sometimes those kinds of things turn out to be a bar bet or an angry and defiant newspaper owner.  http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/theserialharvardoroxfordcomma/ This article points out that both forms were in use back to the 1600s, and I know that prior to that the hand scribed texts employed a much wider variety of punctuation, shorthand words and phrases, abbreviations by symbols, &c.  I also ran across http://www.siue.edu/IS/WRITING/NewsletterC/Issue%208/page3.html this article, which I only note because of the dedication at the end of the text. jw
        Yeah, I was actually taught that either was correct  Ive just always thought that lists were clearer with the comma.  But the first article shows that sometimes the Oxford comma can be ambiguous, too (at which point Id be rewording the sentence).  The dedication in the second article is priceless  thanks.  :)  cp  P.S.  Now that weve had all of this grammar fun, who wants the honors of editing the protest page?

20100319 21:35:15 nbsp It seems like a fairly extreme solution.  Plus, when I blanked the Real Computers entry after an edit war with no good resolution, I wound up thinking that it was a bad idea  although that was in conjunction with a lock, which is a fairly different situation.  Id be okay with trying a replace abused entry with a notice to communicate to move things toward breaking a problem edit cycle.  Personally I think getting working communication started is worth blanking a single entry for awhile (with Front Page a couple Explore exceptions). Users/JabberWokky

20100324 02:50:09 nbsp As fun as it is to bash politics, when it turns into serious mudslinging, I always remember Heinleins bit of dialog from Podkayne of Mars, where her uncle agrees with her that it is stupid that she is locked into shopping only at the high priced port shops, but objects to her dismissing politics itself as stupid.  He tells her: Think about it. Politics is just the name for how we get things done... without fighting. We dicker and compromise and everyone thinks he has received a raw deal, but somehow after a tedious amount of talk we come up with some juryrigged way to do it without getting anybodys head bashed in. Thats Politics. The only other way to settle a dispute is by bashing a few heads in... and thats what happens when one side or both sides is no longer willing to dicker. Thats why politics is good even when its bad... because the only other alternative is force  and somebody gets hurt.

Politics may well be a con game, but its a con game that often distracts people from wanting to arm their younger men and go fix that problem over there, either inside or outside their tribe.  Perhaps human beings have evolved the best con of all  people (nearly) always talking each other out of throwing a punch.

20100324 13:07:25 nbsp I know that we do not see eye to eye, but I believed that your comment on Jabberwokkys page contained inaccurate comments that generalized Republicans and kept out anything about Democrats doing exactly the same thing so a little balancing was required.  Users/hankim

      I dont see that anyone tried to stop you.  I also want to point out that I was responding on jws page to the comment that he made just above; I was merely explaining the previous edit to which jw refers.  I wasnt trying to give a defense of my position concerning Republicans (and certainly I wasnt saying anything about Democrats).  And yet apparently, my expression of my opinion, on an another editors page (not on a more public page) was so offensive to you that you felt you had to respond to it.  (Something is wrong on the internet!!  I must answer it!!)  Dont you think that I have a response to make to yours?  The problem is that I have too much to say, not too little.  And based on past experience, I am sure that you would have plenty to say in response, and so on.  Well, this is a pretty bad forum for debating politics and economics, and I dont have the time for it even if it were.  So, one of us has to exercise some selfcontrol and nip the discussion in the bud, and in this case, it was me.   cp
         The problem is that I know you have a response to make to mine considering your strong political views and I am highly curious about it. Users/hankim

20100402 00:10:03 nbsp I did the original back page too.  It was supposed to be what you saw as you left Davis, but people interpreted last as the final page on the Wiki, so it kind of changed direction from there.  :) Users/IDoNotExist
  Which pretty much fits, as what you toss out to the community often ends up in a very different form.  I had an idea for this year, but I ran into a technical problem.  Somebody fixed a (minor) security hole in the last couple years and blocked my idea. Ah, well.  jw
   I just had fun mucking with the Wiki/April Fools Day, 2010 front page, and was glad that you started the fun off.  cp

20100405 15:45:25 nbsp I was just thinking that.  Change it into a short quick and dirty guide to the things people want to do quickly with a link to getting more involved in editing.  Quick and dirty would cover (preferably with screenshots): editing an entry, adding a photo and creating a new entry.  Possibly show linking, although Im iffy for the simple reason that you need to really get to know the structure of the wiki to know where to link thingsFootnote(Which is why I kind of dislike long titles like Beauty Salons & Fingertanning Citadels or whatever it is.  If I have to look up the name each time I want to link it, its probably not a good name.  Athough I have no ideas of how to improve the situation given the dislike of redirects.).  Everything else goes into getting more involved in editing.  There should probably also be a cross link to the Welcome to the Wiki, which are more social overview than a practical editing how to guide. Users/JabberWokky

20100413 15:46:37 nbsp Both the iPad and the Kindle are good ebook readers.  If you plan to only read ebooks with your device, you may prefer the Kindle because of its longer battery life and lighter weight.  If you want to use the device for more than that, the iPad is way better.  You can read kindle books on the iPad, along with epub standard books and other formats.

You may also want to spend a few hours staring at each one whilst reading.  The Kindles screen is probably better for reading books, but wont work without external illumination.  The iPads display is more like reading on a very nice monitor.

They have a bunch of iPads that you can play with at the UCD Bookstore computer shop. Users/IDoNotExist
  Yeah, I am still torn, though youre right, I do need to spend time with each device.  I wish the Kindle was on sale in a brickandmortar store so I could spend some time with it.   I like the idea that the iPad can be more than an ereader, but as JW and others have pointed out, some of that functionality (e.g, Pages, Numbers, etc.) isnt really all that usable, and there is the extra weight to consider.  Then I think the Nook supports more file formats than the Kindle  I am not sure how iPad and the Nook compare in that regard.  I dont want to spend a lot of money on formats that turn out to be unsupported in the long run (when ereaders get weeded out).  Or, similarly, I dont want to buy ereader X which relies on format Y only to have it turn out that the largest number of ebooks are available in an unsupported format Z.  Adding to my confusion/frustration is that a lot of books simply arent available as ebooks now, anywhere (unless you go the illegal route).  Oh, and I want whatever format it is to be viewable on my Mac, too, with the ability to annotate.  I just dont think any of these ereaders are there yet, though I will be happily corrected if I am wrong.  cp
    Oh my.  Run.  Save yourself.  Do not buy a Nook.  I played with one for about 40 minutes.  It was by far the worst ereader of the three.  Its uncomfortable to hold, balanced in the wrong place, has poor button layout, is slow and unresponsive, and generally doesnt work very well.  Other than that, its great!  :)   I think you will be far happier with a Kindle or iPad than a Nook.  Or a Sony.  Users/IDoNotExist
     Ok, no Nook  check.  But Sonys dont play well with Macs, is that right?  cp
        Sonys site claims that they do work with Macs.  But the Sony readers dont seem nearly as nice as the Kindle.  They use eink, like the Kindle.  But they cant download content wirelessly.  They dont have the Kindles nice keyboard.  I really doubt that they have anything like Amazons selection of books.  (Or Apples!)  Although they do have the Wall Street Journal!  So you can get a newspaper every day.  At least one, that is.  Honestly, the Kindle is way better than the Sony.   Oh, did I mention Sonys bad habit of removing advertised features from existing products (Playstation 3), or installing malware on the machines of people who buy their stuff?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_CD_copy_protection_scandal  Buy at your own risk.

20100413 22:31:08 nbsp You have not tried Beach hut Deli?  That place is awesome.  If you want something particularly tasty get the Drakester.  It is turkey with cream cheese and ortega chilies.  It is like a jalapeno popper sandwich.  If you want the best deal, get the surfin bird combo, it is a huge turkey sandwich (with avacado and bacon), bag of chips, and a beer (or soda). The sandwiches are so so good, do yourself a favor and try their sandwiches.  Users/DagonJones
  Actually, I did try them once, and I wasnt that happy with my sandwich, although I no longer remember which one it was.  I usually dont review places if Ive only been there once, because any restaurant can have a bad day, or you can just order the wrong thing.  The Drakester does sound good... maybe Ill make it back there one of these days and try it.  cp

I guess maybe delete means a lot more to me than a typical person, especially in terms of how Im trying to assert my beliefs into a community setting.  And yes, I do generally disagree with an acutely specific sense of purpose as you have sensed.  I just think that maybe not everybody knows the rules, and actually, if Daniel was the one who created the original nonrealname account that created the page, he may not have been fully aware of the rules.  Also, he may have actually been trying to OBEY the rules later on by creating a specific page that references him.  I just think its a shame to delete hours worth of work on a technicality, and also because it is representative of a human being and how someone wanted to express his beliefs..   Users/ScottMeehleib

  Watertower moving is one of the duties of a professor who does not yet have tenure.

I deleted what I felt did not need to be on there (after attempting to contact an editor who made a large number of changes on the page) and then other editors came in and we discussed what to do then did some more editing. That is the whole point of a Wiki if I am not mistaken? Users/hankim

20100422 17:43:54 nbsp Maybe you would prefer such a discussion before, but the other times I have made large edits to a page (for example CalPIRG) I have attempted to discuss it and the general consensus from the discussions was that I should edit what I think needs editing and if other editors disagree with my edits, then we will talk it out. Yes, I might have deleted some of your additions, but it only took a few clicks to undo that and we discussed the edits and there was no edit war. No huge disaster arose from this like you seem to believe. Users/hankim

20100422 17:52:28 nbsp Theres editing, and then there is deleting a huge portion of text in order to completely change the meaning of a page.  In my view, thats not how members of a community should behave.  But I am repeating myself now.  You seem determined to defend your actions and deny your motivations, so I see no point in discussing it further.  As usual, we reach an impasse. Users/CovertProfessor
  The page was about budget cuts and the page did remain about budget cuts. Of course I am determined to defend my actions, because I did them for a reason (which is that I felt that the page needed editing). There would be no point in discussing it any further if I did not feel such a need, but I shall agree to an armistice. Users/hankim
   Youre being disingenuous.  Of course you intended to change the meaning of the page, not just clean it up.  If you are trying to piss my off even further, you are succeeding admirably.  I dont object to you wanting your point of view included (that seems to be the difference between you and me) but as I said before, if you wanted your point of view represented there was a far better way to do it.  cp

My PI wants a draft by the months end, and I know well be editing it back and forth, but I dont want my first draft to make me look ridiculous in his eyes. Users/EdWins
  Who is the granting agency?  Thats step 1  consider your audience.  Youll want to make your research understandable to that audience, which means using fewer technical terms or explaining the technical terms that you do use.  They also usually want to hear about the broader implications of your research  sometimes you have to stretch a little with that one.  :)  Other than that, explain the research that you plan to undertake and how you plan to go about it, what you expect to find, again, being as clear as possible.  Without knowing more about your specific situation, thats about all of the general advice that I have.  Feel free to ask more specific questions if you have them.  And yeah, grant writing sucks, but youll definitely need  practice in writing about your research!  cp

These are NIH and NIGMS (general medical sciences) funded, but theyre allocated and managed within similar oncampus departments, each with a small committee deciding. Ive got to be extremely specific scientifically, and extremely concise.  Thats something I suck at!  Apparently competition is a bit high (either from 5:1 to 15:1 applicants per slot available depending on which grant), and they might hold interviews in which they question experimental approaches.  Part of my frustration is my PI wants me to apply to one that, in my opinion, were not eligible for.  He thinks its a matter of tweaking our main application into an alternate, but I think it really means rewriting and doing entirely different experiments.  Doh!  Me dont need no stinkin practish with the writings... my goal was always to piggyback off colleagues!  heheheh.  Actually, Im trying to break it down as much as possible.  Make an outline. Make an extended outline. Add experimental details. Make notes on the why this is neat type stuff.  Reformulate as needed...flesh it out piece by piece.  Its painful, but Ive still got over a month, so Im optimistic I can do it.  Hopefully overtime Ill learn to cut out a few of the baby steps.

20100510 10:37:11 nbsp A variant, yes.  With specific limits to keep the ideal of an open wiki.  The idea is to make the system tools like Recent Changes and the Info tab have information, but the actual content itself be subject to equal participation by all.  Not even separate but equal participation for people who only add a couple things to the wiki (and whose additions would be forever automatically flagged if it appears on the content side of things).  Somebody proposed something very similar in one of the discussions already under leave it alone, but maybe new antispam tools, which is another way of presenting a similar end result.

I lack the time right this moment to read through everything again and figure out the best fix without losing options.  I seem to have bungled the options a bit, and am leery of fixing it quickly and making it worse.  Ill look it over in a couple hours, and feel free to change them.

20100513 20:37:46 nbsp (Re: “Dr.” versus “Prof.”) I took a class with Dr. Michael Whiting last year, who, about two weeks into the quarter, gently informed us that we should address him as “Dr. Whiting” or “Mike” instead of “Prof. Whiting” (which a few people have, apparently) because he was just a lecturer as opposed to an adjunct/associate/tenured professor. It wasn’t that he objected to the misnomer, but that he did not want his tenured colleagues to think that he was the one requesting to be addressed as such and the Xworkplace dramaX misunderstandings that could potentially follow.

That said, I’ve always liked how the University of Virginia handles the matter: Professors are traditionally addressed as “Mr.” or “Ms.” instead of “Doctor” (although medical doctors are the exception and are called “Doctor”) in deference to Thomas Jefferson’s desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia#Student_life the other wiki) Users/EBT
  While I appreciate Dr. Whitings fastidiousness, as far as I am concerned, anyone who has sole responsibility for a college class is the professor of that class, whether they are an Assistant Professor, an Associate Professor, a Professor (all tenure track or tenured positions), a Lecturer/Adjunct or even a grad student.  You arent giving someones title when you call them Professor SoandSo,  (after all, we dont say Assistant Professor SoandSo), but rather giving their position or their role (acting professor, so to speak). On the other hand, someone acting as a professor in a class might not yet have their doctorate, and so Dr. SoandSo might not be appropriate.  That being said, there are two issues here: One is not to insult your professor.  I dont think you can insult somebody by calling them Professor or Dr., but the other possible names (yes, including Mr./Ms./Mrs.) are potentially insulting.  The second issue, of course, is to call your professor what they want to be called once they have expressed a preference.  cp

20100514 14:20:27 nbsp My preference is for reasoned consideration of each individual case.  Pretty much in all things.  In the case of anonymity, it is weighing the issue of the harm that anonymity causes (a fractured community and lack of empathy and personal connection to each other and the project) against the practical considerations of the individual.  You have a real reason to be anonymous, clearly explained and have an honest and open effort to be a part of the community and forge interpersonal relationships within a thoughtful boundary.  You counter the negatives through your actions.  Again, its not anonymity that is really the issue... its accountability and community.  Anonymity simply is a common trait of editor accounts that cause many of the problems on the wiki.  Many are created with a singular purpose in mind (e.g.: Trash that apartment that screwed me! Slam that waiter that I didnt like! Promote my business!).  Others are created with the idea of acting like an ass to garner respect (as occurs in some online communities where a snarky wit is celebrated over communication).  Its a tough issue, but confusing the indicator (anonymity) with the actual problems (lack of accountability, empathy, and community) is not something I intend to do.  Im perfectly happy with anonymity without the other issues.  The problem is that when youre talking to somebody who has been on the wiki for a day or two, its typical to simplify things.  Thus you tell somebody, you shouldnt remove comments, thats not how we do things here, but experienced wiki editors know that there are times in which removing comments is okay.  It the same way it is a convenient simplification to say anonymity is bad.  What I actually try to do is discourage a lack of accountability and encourage a feeling of commitment as a member of the community, thus forging social empathy to each other.  When an editor with revert rights just doesnt give a damn about anybody else... well... we know what happens then.  It is very difficult (and somewhat unfair) to dump all of that on a new editor who has just created the account IHatePlutos and expect them to understand the ramifications of their actions.  Its even more tough to get into the subtle issues that a name like InvisibleNinja causes in a cooperative editing setting when youre trying to actually discuss issues as peers.  I think the move toward referring to the issue as one of identity is an effort to find a better way to present the complex situation in an easy to digest manner.

In short, you are accountable, engage in a social give and take with other people, are not editing for a single cause and youre not using a business name for many different people to edit behind (i.e., you are personally accountable).    I have zero issues with you using CovertProfessor and keeping the name you use on the streets hidden, much like AlphaDog or EdWins.  The issue of anonymity is simply that it makes it more difficult to do those things, something that I would guess you would agree with in certain cases where anonymity has made things awkward or limited certain options.  You are oft cited as a sterling example of how being anonymous does not have to be a negative, something that I agree wholeheartedly with.  In my humble opinion (and you shouldnt need it), I say keep editing  you are a valuable, respected and well liked contributor here. Users/JabberWokky

20100514 14:37:54 nbsp By the way, I hope that the above starts to explain my take on things.  It is a complex issue, and like most complex issues, it lends itself to onesided simplistic positions.  I think the discussion can and should be at a higher level than that when it is between people who have experienced the multiple dynamics in play.  That was the point I was trying to make on the one entry when I wound up having to protest that I was not advocating a strict RealNames policy. Users/JabberWokky

20100514 17:24:29 nbsp I always try to answer obnoxiousness with kindness at least a couple times.  I will ignore the most obvious and likely scenario and reach out as if I missed the negative aspects of what they did.  If they are well meaning but stumbled with their first edits, it helps them out by establishing communication.  If they are nasty and/or confrontational, it gives them a way out, and by not calling them out on what they really did, it allows them to save face.  I really dont care about appearing insightful: Id much rather look kind of dumb or slow and guide things to a situation where somebody can become a positive contributor to the wiki.  It also helps if they feel somebody can at least understand some aspect of their position (which is the part that I think caused you to be concerned).  None of it is intended to be shady, but rather just an effort at tactful outreach and inclusion for people who had a rather rough start.  Assume the best, even if it makes you look naive seems to be effective.  In my mind its somewhat similar to save the patient first.  Being quick to forgive is also probably important, as were all going to make really dumb mistakes and say stupid things eventually.  Some people just start out that way. Users/JabberWokky

20100524 14:07:41 nbsp I understand your point and agree with you on a personal level.  But I also think that most people are so trapped within the us vs. them paradigm that they may accept nearly any kind of abuse so long as they are led to believe it will somehow benefit us as a species.  For example, the famous Stanley Milgram authority experiment was replicated with everyday people being asked to administer fatal electrical shocks to puppies just for the sake of a false study which the participants apparently thought was of some benefit to society.  Researchers  repeated the experiment with a real victim: a puppy who was given real electric shocks. They found that 20 out of the 26 participants complied to the end. The six that had refused to comply were all male (54% of males were obedient); all 13 of the women obeyed to the end, although many were highly disturbed and some openly wept. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#cite_note27 source    Perhaps I am just too pessimistic though; that puppy study was from 1972 so perhaps times have changed.

20100524 14:54:20 nbsp re: stress study, Im certain some of them are specifically focused on the primates, not on any human benefit.  After all, if theres indeed lots of physiological stress reactions, that may skew data/results.  Doing a study for the focus of refining methodology isnt unheard of, especially on ethical issues.  Users/EdWins

20100524 15:24:48 nbsp re: I guess my point was that they are not doing studies on stress in nonhuman primates because they are worried about stress in nonhuman primates and want to do something to alleviate it.   Actually, my point was that they very well are (some of them).  Its important to try to be as fair and balanced and have complete information available.  If nonhuman primates are being used as research subjects, then understanding what we can about them in the context of being research subjects is important.  Some of these studies wont relate to humans at all, but they certainly might serve to inform and influence laws, regulations, oversight committees, etc.  Its a sad bit ironic when some of them cause pain to prevent pain, and thats one hell of a ethical dilemma to ponder for the philosophers.  (Use some monkeys to potentially save other monkeys? Or change the way stuff is done?).  Some of these studies certainly fuel those who are opposed to primate research, and by all rights it should: thats what the datas for. Trying to increase understanding, period. Perhaps some physiological responses to things people take for granted might very well have downstream effects.  ie, just because theres a set of protocols on the right way to do X Y or Z procedures doesnt mean its the best way, and maybe it skews both research results and is justification for either side of the various ethical debates.   Im not being very clear, but I hope that you see the point Im trying to get across: understanding them for the sake of understanding them can indeed be important.  But thats a far cry away from some peoples view of torture for the sake of torture.  I suppose at best or at worst, its torture for the sake of stopping torture? Rather depressing for some indeed.  Users/EdWins

20100524 16:33:14 nbsp Honestly, I dont know.  My understanding of much of this stuff is very basic, and I clearly havent gone into background information.  But I have worked in labs with animals before (nonlethal...one lab used dogs for a tick study, that later get cleaned up and adopted out and now lead perfectly normal lives).  Theres an insane amount of oversight and laws and hoops to jump through, and experimentations are not trivial.  The biggest misconception out there is that its easy to just test something in mice, for example. No, its not, it takes months before you can even go near a mouse.  I would guess that the constant changing of laws, regulations, ethics committies and IACUC (institutional animal care and use) committiees requiring frequent recertification and approvals all happen for a reason beyond something as simple as a simple rule change. Theres reasoning behind it, be it based on ethical discourse or likely some specific research guiding it.  The lab Im in now uses mice, and were not even allowed to change the way we draw blood without submitting a request and modifications to protocol, explaining why, explaining why its preferrable to the old way, and waiting on approval.  Even if it seems as something as trivial as taking blood from the tail (theres a tail vein) versus the rear leg.  The process to even use animals is huge, and its got a million more hoops for primate research, because that is indeed controversial and a hot issue. Theres a need for independent oversight as well.  At the UCs for example, animals are also cared for and monitored independently of whichever research labis using them.  Theres certainly far more handson oversight at the primate research centers: theres not many of them, theyre controversial, and theyre kind of a big deal. My main frustration with the primate page has been the implicit suggestion that animal use happens allwilly nilly, or more specifically, that its also done under the radar. Its just not.  And when were talking over primates, which are so highly regulated and of high interest, its really borderline ludicrous.  Now, clearly not everyone or every technician is an angel, but theyre in an extreme minority.  Actual abuse is awful, but its absolutely inno ones interest to torture monkeys for the sake of it as the purpose of a study (which again, need to likely be planned and request approval months to years in advance, and quite a lot get rejected.  I believe I mentioned somewhere that sometimes theyre collaborations with multiple labs analyzing different aspects of the same data, in order to minimize the number of animals used).  Users/EdWins

  Personally, I am not sure that she needs welcoming.  I am not sure that every new user needs a welcome.  She used a name  its not like ThisPlaceSucks or something like that  although she chose not to use a last name.  She said something pretty harsh, but I think most people know that whether someone was acting in a racist manner can be somewhat of a matter of perception and will read the comment in that light.  If that turns out to be the only comment that says that or if other people dispute the comment, then that will mean something.  If other people corroborate the comment, then that will mean something, too.  In short I think the comment is potentially informative and the user hasnt done anything wrong.  Yes, we could encourage her to say more about her identity, but maybe she will come back in time and do so on her own if she finds this a positive experience.  Or we could tell her that she has made a harsh accusation, but no doubt she knows that and perhaps feels it is justified.  I guess what I am saying is that unless someone has done something egregious  deleted or modified someone elses comment, said something offensive or made a personal attack, we might take a wait and see attitude and see how things go from there (if they go anywhere).

20100528 20:53:36 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Recent_Changes?actionsearch&inline_stringracist&x0&y0 racism is a charge that gets thrown a lot. Most of the time on the wiki my reaction is that the person hurling the charge is leveling it out of anger rather than because there was really something to base it on. There is a big difference between a business putting up a No Irish Need Apply sign and a perception that race was a reason for perceived differential treatment between customers. Users/JasonAller
  I agree that it gets thrown around a lot, often without basis.  But your reaction to the comment supports my point that most people wont give comments like that much weight unless it turns out to be a pattern.  And we wont know if its a pattern unless we leave the comment.  And again, someone else may dispute it, which would be informational.  It is my belief that the person was probably ignored, as she said.  Whether it was because of her race, her age, her clothing, her demeanor, or something else, I have no idea.  She perceived it as due to her race; it may not have been.  I do think that it is not unheard of for people to act on biases that they themselves might not even be fully aware of.  cp

20100608 09:29:09 nbsp Are you familiar with the events of the summer of 1991 in Davis as they relate to the accusations about the skateboard rapists? Users/JasonAller

20100608 09:47:20 nbsp That August Davis was damaged heavily by charges of a gang rape that turned out to be false. The saddest victims of all in my mind were real victims of rape. I feel that way because of how events unfolded. I havent wanted to put anything on the wiki about that event yet; mostly because doing so would hurt additional rape victims. The similarities in my mind however cause me to want to share the story with you. Can you pull up newsbank and go to the Sacramento Bee and search for Davis skateboard rape so I dont have to repeat the facts? Sadly the Davis Enterprise coverage isnt online as it would paint the picture a little more clearly. Let me know if youve read about the case. Users/JasonAller

20100608 10:44:34 nbsp I pointed out the 1991 incident because it shows how Davis reacts. The graffiti and flyers from that summer and the letters to the editor made a pretty strong impression.

20100610 11:30:12 nbsp The younger fen running around at SF Cons (and lest it seem I am being dismissive, thats the future of fandom, and they are danged important) tend to use cosplay as a term for all costuming.  Not all, and if we were a fandom wiki, it might make sense to explain the rootless nature of the third wave anime fans (who came into the culture when anime became popular in the mainstream in conjunction with video games being seen as socially acceptable rather than something to get mocked for), and how a lack of connection to established fandom caused terminology across the board to be recoined rather than inherited.  It was an interesting population and interest swell during the 90s that affected (and affects) fandom in the same way the boomer generation affects the culture of the US.  There are a ton of really interesting essays and books written about the topic. Fandom really organized in the 1950s, well before the internet was popular, so there was a strong tradition of tracking people and interests (just so people could find each other in the days when it was difficult to communicate among people too far away to see each other face to face on a regular basis).  That tracking was still in effect during the rise of that young upswell into fandom (and has since dropped off as email and websites have made it less critical).  The lineages of con committees and the disconnected new cons that appeared during that era (and an epic swath of failed cons as groups without experience learned to run cons the hard way without the help of people with decades of experience) is particularly telling.

Most established cons have masquerades.  Younger, hip cons where people over 40 are looked at with suspicion (and to be brutally honest, often mocked), tend to have cosplay contests.  And yes, Im using the term younger for cons less than 15 to 20 years old, so its a relative term at this point.

I picked on the Dog entry because it is so well written and intelligently laid out, with a good introduction and a pretty comprehensive scope (again, its the positioning I have issues with, not the topics at all  in fact, were they removed, Id see the entry as missing information).  Although, there are three topics I see missing on Dogs.  Local breeders (while Im somewhat personally somewhat against breeding  except for service dogs, who are bred for health and temperament rather than just appearance  they should probably be noted in the entry, including laws on breeding for profit, should somebody decide to do so), what to do when you find a stray dog, either feral or lost (and probably a section on feral dogs in general), and dog licenses (which Yolo County says are required).  I did a quick search through for each topic, but I could have missed them by searching for the wrong words. Users/JabberWokky

Ill take a whack tomorrow morning at reworking the Pregnancy entry in a way that presents everything in a positive manner for people who make all different choices and various needs.  It just feels very aimed at undergrads right now, with the information front loaded towards certain paths more common for people of college age.  Paths that I wholeheartedly endorse for people who need them (and thats all Ill state on my personal beliefs), but with a jarring lack of information for people looking to actually go through a pregnancy.  Jessica did a fantastic job adding what she knows.  Still, it is such a major topic that people going through it will really want to find and learn about local resources.  Given that, it seems awfully incomplete  even just by random Google gives more information standards.  Right now Im thinking the actual order is probably reasonable with an intro and reorganized headers to jump to the readers area of interest. Users/JabberWokky

20100621 14:52:20 nbsp Hello. Its been a while. I no longer live in Davis but recently found an old article from 2009 that stated that the UC Davis campus was installing a new food/nutrition labeling system involving apples. I was curious as to whether it actually went into effect. I cant find a page on it on the Davis wiki, so my initial reaction was to question its existence, haha. You can find the article here http://docs.google.com/viewer?av&qcache:WpLwMPzRL_kJ:nutrition.ucdavis.edu/content/alumni/Summer2009.pdf+%22nutrition+bowl%22+csun+uc+davis&hlen&glus&pidbl&srcidADGEESiQTfM_rzFxtUifDjGmfW9UkKoL_TOgulfxyvnYxS0IdNvCiiXaiVi0waaAD2A4V8ZDkcY4WQiMH8uJmwEEZHPuqtwU7JXNssN_plt45rMBHf7ImO9eH4WeP07Pyp5zp2q8Qn&sigAHIEtbSvPyZKZyGtUE4PV3yjv8FUVv0Ig nutrition news letter.

  You have to register as a writein candidate to be elected. However, the people who run the election are free to count the writeins no matter what. wl
   There was an article in the Enterprise shortly after the election saying that all of these unofficial writeins really gummed up the works and delayed the counting.

  Wait... because I disagree with you about some edits, you take to imply that I think you should stop gnoming?  Jason, thats out of line. Do you think so little of me, that I am so intolerant of disagreement that Id rather see you gone?  Or is it that I must accept all of your edits or none of them?  Yes, these questions are hyperbolic.  So is yours.  As for the other questions  it is actually my belief that the names on the Lil Sis page have no value whatever  I just didnt want to get into it, so I said little or no value.  Something cute or whimsical  that has value.  Real history, about what people did  that has value.  Someones experience with a local business, etc.  that has value.  Lists of names for people who were not elected to any office or served in some official capacity in an organization, without any information about what these people did?  No value.  My claim isnt that the names should be removed because they might harm someone.  My claim is that since they have no value, they should be removed because people have asked them to be removed, presumably because they are concerned about harm.  There is simply, in my view, no loss to their removal, and no implication that other wiki information that does have value can thereby be removed.  You and I disagreed over the Strelizia comment that you allude to.  I thought it did have value; perhaps you did not think it had value.  I think a lot of recent disagreements between editors are in part disagreements over what is valuable, or, to use a term used elsewhere in recent discussions, which edits are constructive. cp

If people really dont see value in the things Im restoring back onto pages then maybe I no longer understand the wiki and I need to stop doing that. I disagree with it, but if what I see as productive edits are a source of problems then Im willing to reexamine why Im doing what Im doing.  I think the source of the tension is not you per se, but different and deeply held beliefs about what is best for the wiki.  You and I are two participants in that larger conversation.

  Was http://daviswiki.org/Users/JabberWokky?actiondiff&version21731&version11730 this a helpful way to comment on my and another editors activities in welcoming a new editor?  cp
   My comment was pretty borderlne, but as an alternative to dragging a new user into things I stand by it. Now please answer my question. Users/JasonAller
    It was more than borderline.  You metaphorically referred to IDNE and I as vampires, and attributed some strange motive to our behavior (as though we want more like us?  like I am encouraging anonymity by... what?  making a joke?  not being nasty?), instead of the simpler explanation  it was late at night, and we were simply having a bit of lighthearted fun with a new editor who chose an evocative username.  I was pretty well insulted by your comment, but tried to keep a sense of humor about it with my reply to JWs page.  (By the way, my comment meant to imply: if were such a problem, then do something about us.  I have already offered to leave the wiki if my presence is so harmful, so it would not be hard).  With regard to BL  he has been gone from the wiki for just a month.  He comes back and implicitly criticizes the wellmeaning activities of one of the most wellmeaning, productive, and relatively recent editors we have (with a real name, no less!).  All I did was  in a lighthearted way, I thought  point out that his past editing activities were not always entirely towards producing new content.  If I remember correctly, that is a bit of an understatement.  If I am misremembering, then I apologize.  cp
     The welcome of Users/jeanvaljean looked like http://daviswiki.org/Users/jeanvaljean?actionrecall&version2 this when I made my comment. I see two edits. One which is an __unsigned__ and __unlinked__ welcome that looks more like an excuse to show off cultural knowledge than an attempt to make a human connection and build community. The other which is __unsigned__ and __unlinked__ was slightly more humorous in its phrasing, but was more of the same. Neither made a human connection with the new editor. Neither reached out in a way that would let a new user know who left them or who they could go to if they had questions. So I left the comment I did to JabberWokky. It wasnt more than borderline, it was descriptive of my reaction, my signed reaction... you know the signature that connects the consequences of what I write to my offwiki existence. When Brent, Don or I make asses of ourselves we have the real world consequences of that behavior to live with. When http://daviswiki.org/Users/BrianPakpour?actiondiff&version29&version17 you goad named editors into exchanges you dont look bad off the wiki, but the other editor does. That is inherently unequal. Although you may be convincing me to change my ways, it isnt in the way you think because you make a really good argument for why I should stop editing using my real name and pick a new IP address and a new anonymous username and then I can snipe at real people without any regard for the consequences. Users/JasonAller
      None of that changes the fact that your signed comment was deeply insulting.   I may not use a real name on the wiki, but I am in fact a real person. And I was insulted for what?  Because IDNE and I did not sign our comments?  It was an offhand thing that I gave little thought to.  And when BP made a personal accusation on a page that is calling for a reconciliation, yes, I am going to say something.  If I am going to participate on this wiki, then it isnt going to be with my hands tied behind my back.  I certainly have said nothing that is even remotely as insulting as what you said about me on JWs page.  And I am tired of you calling for other editors to be respectful when you yourself are often not respectful.  If this is you with your gloves on, because you are signing your real name, I hate to think of what you are like with your gloves off.  Please reread what you wrote on JWs page, no matter how heartfelt it was, and think about how that might read to the people it was discussing.  cp

You could just make a link to the Dog Parks page and move the external links over there. As you know, on a wiki nobody needs permission to edit what somebody else has written.

Your users page is impressive. Your restaurant reviews are interesting as a group, and I see that you have also posted directly on the pages for the individual restaurants.

20100824 22:21:05 nbsp Hi CovertProfessor, I noticed that some comments were missing from Angies beauty salon, of which is now Angies Hair Salon. Then I came across your comment towards another individual saying basically the same. I am new to this and would like advise about this situation; do I make a comment about what has been accuring and post it under angies beauty salon or do I just leave it alone. Angie is such a good person and stylist and I feel its so wrong what Expressions Hair Design stylists are doing. Thanks for your time. Users/ElizabethL

20100828 22:17:20 nbsp The reason I did that was because when I was at the Salon, some clients that were there at the same time, were the once that actually mentioned about the Salon being closed. And they mentioned that it was confusing and that it seemed as if Angie no longer had a business. The changes made reflect that the business is still there, and its still the same business the only difference is the beauty/hair part of the business name, also some of the people that used to work there are no longer there.  Users/ElizabethL

20100830 19:12:53 nbsp Even if this were all Luci was trying to do, deleting every comment on the salon page is still shady and tends to go against everything on the Wiki.

20100907 22:28:03 nbsp Hello, I am sorry to bombard your page with all this. My name is Anamaria and I was one of the owners of Angies Beauty Salon. I just wanted to clear a few things up regarding recent changes and comments made about the salon I currently own (Expressions) and the salon I use to coown (Angies Beauty Salon). I loved Angies Beauty Salon! Angie and I started that salon from scratch and turned it into a successful business! I poured my heart and soul into that business for the last 10 Years!

Angie and I just decided to part ways for personal reasons.

I simply wanted to let the public know that Angie and I legally closed down Angies Beauty Salon. We even featured it in the Davis Enterprise as a closed business and terminated the business license. Angie decided to keep the location and phone number and open a new salon with a new name and new license number, which she named Angie Hair Salon. I, in NO way, have any ill intentions towards Angie Hair Salon.

I, along with some of our clients, wanted to let the public know where to find me and two other hair stylists that worked at Angies Beauty Salon...that was all!

Again...I meant no harm. If our clients or I made it seem that way I am truly sorry!

If anyone wants to know more please feel free to call me and ask any questions.

Thank you so much for your time. Users/Anavarro

   Thanks  I feel like Im in good company.  cp

20100909 16:12:37 nbsp Hi CP.  I took a little while to get back to you, not because I was ignoring you, but because I wanted to make sure my response was quite what I meant.  Since the wiki is a conglomeration, an extension of those who make it up, dont you think its best to represent multiple viewpoints?  While I agree with you, even my second attempt seemed overly harsh, perhaps there is a better way I could phrase it to make it seem more welcoming.  I invite you to continue sharing your alternate viewpoint, and hope you could give me some guidance on how to phrase what I hope was an otherwise clear point in a more friendly manner.  Users/MasonMurray
  Honestly  it is hard for me to suggest how to word your suggestion because I think you are simply mistaken on this one.  See JWs and ESs comments above for an explanation of why it is good to split edits apart.  Aside from the reasons they give, it often the case that we do preview, and then afterward, think of something else to say, a better way to word something, or another thing to link, etc..  So, then you are criticizing someone for simply being human and not always thinking of everything all at once.  Also, if you are wary of computer/network crashes, doing things in chunks is like saving a document often  its simply safe practice.  So, in general, yes  I think its best to represent all sides.  But honestly, in this case, it just seems like you are nitpicking at wellmeaning editors, and I think that does more harm than good.  Sure, if someone is clearly not previewing  they are continually miscoding the page, over and over again  then you might point out that there is a preview button that could help them out.  But no one likes to be criticized, and there are so many more egregious things that editors can do (spam, shill, make personal attacks, etc.), that it seems as though the main thing youre accomplishing by leaving these notes is to waste your time and to make things that much more unpleasant for new editors.  And I genuinely think it would be better if you didnt do it at all for people who are merely splitting their edits up.  Sorry.  cp
   You must find it at least a little humerus that your primary criticism is that people dont like to be criticized.  Since your response basically read Give up and do something else, youre wasting your time and not helping (constituting flaming on most sites, I might add) and you are unwilling to help, Ill continue to try and shift my phrasing on my own.  I invite you to continue sharing your dissenting opinion, but I hope you will do so with more civility in the future. MM
    Yes, I was aware of the irony, and hoped that you would pick up on it.  Not much fun, is it?  But I am criticizing in order to try to prevent what I see as a greater harm.  Please consider the harms vs. the benefits.  And also please consider that my reply was not uncivil.  And that you did ask for my opinion.  I gave it.  cp
    OIC wat u did thar.  Very nice.  After the fact I can thoroughly enjoy it.  I will weigh the opinions expressed here and exercise more care checking the edits rather than counting them.  On an English related note, I was careful not to call it irony, because of how often the word is used improperly.  I make sure not to use it unless Im absolutely sure it would be correct.  MM
      Checking the edits rather than counting them sounds good to me.  :)  cp

20100909 21:05:36 nbsp Just to add my two cents, I dont think theres anything wrong with having sequential edits, even many of them, as long as theyre reasonably adding content.  Preview should be recommended when a user just failed to proof their edits and had to go back and correct things... often onebyone.  I dont see a problem with sequential edits, as long as theyre decent edits.

That said, I havent looked back over the edits made by this user, or the last time the discussion came up.  So, I cant really comment on whether I think the recommendation was a good idea here or not.

My one other note is that its far better to err on the side of welcoming, encouraging, and positive feedback for newish editors.  Again, Im not saying either way whether thats what happened here.  But if theres any doubt in your mind, I feel its better to limit it to YAY, HAI! EDIT MOAR! the first time around, and leave the finetuning for later. Users/TomGarberson
  I think YAY, HAI! EDIT MOAR should be our new standard greeting. Hell with this welcome to the wiki stuff.  cp

20100927 09:54:01 nbsp Sarah and I got new Android phones on Friday.  You were asking about screens that are easy to read?  The Samsung Epic 4G has a wiki:wikipedia:AMOLED Super AMOLED, which apparently uses some kind of strange sorcery to sooth your eyes as you use it.  Theres a novel texture to the screen that bugged me for about two hours and is now really nice.  Its an artifact of the pixels not being square, I believe.  On the other hand, it also reminds me of the painted quality of medieval illuminations.  Whatever it is, Sarah and I spent basically three solid days staring into tiny little screens and suffered no eyestrain.  EInk, like the Kindle and Nook, is still in a category of its own (as it is basically a printed page that reshuffles itself), but this little screen is amazingly readable.  Alas, it isnt commercially available in large sizes, even that of a ebook reader.  Based on my experience (which is with the Super AMOLED, which addresses some issues with earlier AMOLEDs, especially in direct sunlight), Id certainly keep an eye out for a reader that uses it.  Again, thats assuming you want a reader that can also function as a basic email and browser, which is where monochromatic and sluggish Eink tends to fail.

On the other hand, I still have yet to find any eBook reader that mimics a book enough to create spacial memory to find a section or quote quickly.  I can, however, slide a physical volume off the shelf that I havent touched in years and quickly flip to the section I want.  I can also bring a pile of books to a meeting and share them among newcomers.  That spacial memory of pages and an easy way to share and flip through together are going to be tough to replicate for awhile. Users/JabberWokky
  Thanks, JW.  So far I have been using an iPad and Im pretty pleased with it.  The screen isnt as good as it could be (so I will keep an eye out for the screen you mention, both in a tablet size and smartphone size when Im in the market for one of those), but I find it easier to read than a computer screen for some reason.  I know what you mean about the spacial memory, but on the other hand, on the iPad I can search for particular words, which I cant do in a paper book unless it has a really good index (most dont).  And I can carry a lot more books with the iPad without undue strain.  So, pros and cons.   Users/CovertProfessor
     While reading the New York Times and WSJ, the iPad beats out the newspapers every time.  While doing medieval reenactment and tabletop roleplaying (both characterized by heavy on the spot research in groups of people), Ive found that having both physical books and their searchable PDFs are incredibly useful.  The two together are like an index and pass around version.  For computer programming texts, I just use a computer screen, but thats because of their specific nature and the fact that Im at a computer when referring to them.  For long reading sessions (cover to cover reads), I think books might still edge out the iPad, but screen advances might well flip the advantage to an electronic reader.  I cant really read long texts on a computer screen, but I can with the iPad, so I can see things getting better.   Its an interesting time, somewhat similar to when printing presses became the norm.  jw
       Yeah  I read a lot of PDFs.  If its just one or a few, I prefer the iPad.  But if Im referring to a number of PDFs and trying to write at the same time, I need the computer.  Alas, its rare that I get the time to do a long reading session, so maybe thats why Ive been OK reading books on the iPad.  I agree  things are very interesting right now.  I keep wondering if paper books will go the way of 8track tapes or if they will be more like vinyl records; if things do go mostly electronic, which books will make it and which wont; and how many people will end up like Jean LucPicard.

 Interesting table, Daubert.  Since switching back to Comcast a year and a half ago, Ive definitely been between four nines and five nines.  Years ago when they took over @home cable (or was there one other intermediary?), they were more like two nines.  But damn, I feel bad for people affected by this current problem.  Being down for hours at a time can be really, really aggravating.  Its bad enough when you get dropped for a minute or two. tg
  In this current incarnation of the problem, I havent been down for hours at a time (that really would make my life difficult), but its definitely been 1015 mins/day at times, which also sucks.  cp

  Oh my, yes  I see what you mean.  Well, youll have to act quickly if you spot a lull.  Looking at the history of this page, its been one flare up after another.  Luci seems unrepentant and unwilling to learn about what the page and the wiki are for.  The gall to ask for this deletion after all of the bad behavior floors me, although I guess creating the talk page can be seen as progress of a sort.  Users/CovertProfessor

20101010 20:32:31 nbsp I tried to delete 2 posts on my Chipotle page. My managers identity was used as well as her employee number.

  Good luck, but if Im not mistaken, confidentiality agreement would be a civil matter, not a criminal matter, and the PD probably wont help you.

20101013 13:06:45 nbsp Not a business, but I had to do the same thing with Hotwire.  It does make sense... kind of a variant on NoLongerExists, but heres the new one.  The only problem is that an include cant have the custom text you would probably need to word it right.  Something along the lines of but the same owners and staff now run Foosball Restaurant or, for a band, they reformed after a year as Angry Ants.  If includes had mutable text (a la the {{{stop}}} macro), it would make more sense.  I wonder if theres a way to do it with a partial include... an include for form stuff, and then space for the subject specific info. Users/JabberWokky

20101013 16:47:36 nbsp Of the classics, I miss the seed as well.  I did that one early on, and its actually on a number of wikis out there, Wiki Spot and beyond.  Its kind of a thrill to see it in different places on the web and realize that I drew that with my mouse using a paint program.  We could always kick the seed include down to an inline notice and reinstate it.  Other than the HIPAA and context alerts (NoLongerExists, Departed Business, etc), I dont think theres an absolute need for those larger includes.  The larger seed kind of pushes the idea Hey, you... yes you behind the keyboard... you can edit this!. Users/JabberWokky

20101121 02:53:12 nbsp Hey CovertProfessor! I see that youve noticed my cleaning up of the City Commissions Page. From what the Deputy City Clerk has told me, those Commissions are no longer active, which is why there is no links of it on the City website itself either. Im assuming those old commissions existed long time ago, which probably explains why no one was able to create a page with more information and details of them.

20101127 16:44:19 nbsp Just because I have the same IP address as someone else who leaves a review does not imply that we are the same person, nor does it imply that we have the same computer. It only implies that we connect through the same router.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation was required because if every single person on the internet had their own IP there would not be enough to lease to everyone, which is exactly the reasoning behind IP6.

Since most people in college towns live with roommates since the cost of living is so high it would be especially naive to assume that because two comments are reported to have the same IP from davis wiki that they are the same person. Since essentially all home networks now connect to the internet through a modern router using NAT processing. Having the same IP address on Davis wiki could mean so many different things, that we are the same person, that we live in the same apartment, that we share internet across apartments, that we have shared apartment internet, that we live in the same dorm. It is absurd to assume you know which one it is.

Cheers. Users/upisdown

20101207 17:05:03 nbsp I only removed it because the edit conflict wasnt obvious (it took me a moment to realize I had blocked an edit to my own comment). I like the original sic.  That is decidedly an intentionally placed error in that statement. Users/JabberWokky

20101207 17:28:48 nbsp Sometimes it is just a case leaping on an opportunity to move forward.  Until Emily popped up, I really thought (and from the comments, I was not alone) that there was a pretty straight road toward locking the entry, a la Real Computers. Users/JabberWokky

20101208 10:21:37 nbsp If they use it again, Ill remove it.  Spam accounts almost always only get used once, so I tend to only block them after they post twice (the interface is a bit clunky, and I dont want to fill up the banned account field with every oneshot spamhouse account).  Normally Id block Webmaster after the second bout of edits, but they were in such close chronological proximity, I lumped them in together as one session.  Plus, I kind of liked getting the new terms for the blacklist.  Periodically I sweep all of Wiki Spot for known spam links. Users/JabberWokky

20101211 05:14:04 nbsp (Forgive the pre coffee ramble): I figure that when somebody politely asks what is allowed and reasonable, and has already read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owners and given it careful consideration, they deserve a bit of help.  He was concerned that there was some animosity toward apartment complexes on the wiki, and I told him that while there were a few that had very problematic issues on the wiki (deleting negative reviews, etc), there were also several who have used it to good effect (Tandemonium jumps to mind).  The problem cases sometimes tend to outshine (or maybe outglare) the majority that go smoothly, so I figured somebody trying to do it right deserved as much community attention as the people trying to be sneaky or demanding.

20101229 08:35:35 nbsp John Lofland doesnt quite get the wiki, but hes a living wealth of knowledge about town and very dedicated to discovering and documenting the history of the town, so Im very hesitant to just write off an edit by him.  Hes done so few edits here (relative to his publications) that the ones he does do are notable by being items that have spurred him to edit.  In short  he did perform a poor edit, but it is very likely a reasoned edit given the source.  IMHO, of course, YMMV. Users/JabberWokky
  I hesitated to make the reversion for the reasons that you stated and thought about it awhile before I did it.  But it seemed like an important part of the entry, and I couldnt figure out why he deleted it, unless he thought that no one would make such a mistake or that it was simply confusion to call that area central Davis, or something along those lines (i.e., seeing the description solely from the point of view of someone who has been here a long time).  It is possible, though, that he had a more principled reason.  Can I prevail upon you to ask him about it?  I think he might be more receptive to replying to you.  cp

20101230 13:22:43 nbsp Yeah, thats what I was hinting at.  Getting suspended isnt something that can be blown over, and has to be pretty rare Id imagine. I liked JWs analogy of restaurants: they may get dinged here and there on little things, but if they actually are forced to close their doors, even temporarily, then it must be pretty serious.

20101230 15:17:26 nbsp The word admitted was more than ambiguous.  I would call it misleading in that context.  Thank you for the catch. Users/JabberWokky

20101230 16:05:56 nbsp I read through it thinking there would be some kind of explanation.  Death in the family, incompetent assistant... something to explain the lapse that caused a family to lose their home.  It seems to be a major mistake with serious ramifications.   Users/JabberWokky
  and he earns a one month suspension...  Just shameful.  Users/WesP
   Dont forget two years probation, plus ethics classes.  Presumably, if there were mitigating circumstances, theyd be mentioned in that document, as there is a place for them.  Maybe he was just shy and didnt want to say.  cp
