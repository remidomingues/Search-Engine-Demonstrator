20070415 15:02:09 nbsp Food is good, but definitley not cheap. Users/DonaldJaye

20070427 21:15:53 nbsp I used to eat there all the timeearly 80s the food was awsome. They even gave me and some of the locals an account that we would pay off every week, we could just call in our order and it would be ready when we arrived, the service was excellent, best burger in towneven better than Nations Giant. However I went in a year or so ago,found the wait way to long, tried again and the same thing.What happened to the days when people remembered your name or your food preference or even trusted you. Thats when Davis was a cool place to liveeven the Safeway grocery clerks new our names.This is for all he W.I.S.E. guys who I spent many hours eating with at Murder Burger and having fun! Users/NotImpressed

20070429 11:25:20 nbsp This place is terrible. It has a great rep, but the burgers Ive had on my three visits were mediocre and the fries are ALWAYS BURNT. They need to change their oil at least once a week and I doubt they do that. The restaurant is always grimy and the staff isnt friendly. In short, all the above bitching is true. Users/William.Peacock

20070502 20:31:35 nbsp Redrum is definitely not fast. It usually takes about 30 minutes to get your food.  The joint is not particularly wellrun. They need to get a new doorcloser, too. I can still hear it in my sleep: SLAM.  And yet, the burgers are very good. Optimal bun to burger ratio is achieved with the 1/2 lb burger — but thats a lot of burger. There are lots of topping options (lots of burger options, too), but no pineapple, which is too bad. A chocolate shake with malt rounds out the meal nicely. The onion rings were huge and greasy — never again.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070502 23:22:55 nbsp takes a long time to get food and not exactly a good quantity for the money Users/KaiWan

20070520 10:51:44 nbsp i love hole in the wall places like this..alotta ppl decide to pass and eat at innout, but u gotta give murderburger a try..food is kinda greasy, but hey wat do u expect with a burger joint..only drawback is that without a coupon its pretty expensive Users/DonaldJaye

20070527 15:12:23 nbsp This place is way overpriced and looks/smells dirty.  It takes forever to get your food.  How come i can get a burger in a few minutes at anyother place but it takes an hour here.  I know how long it takes to make a goddam burger.  Last time I tried to go there, I stood in line for 10 minutes and then walked accross the street to in and out.  The line didnt even move. Users/dancohen


20070601 23:09:02 nbsp This place left a terrible first impression on me. My one Burger took like 45 mins to make and i had time so no biggie but then, the dude inside treated me like i just showed up on the short bus with a helmet and a big foam #1 hand. MESSAGE TO REDRUM; I understand that it sucks to work but, dont dish out a bunch of crap to innocent customers who you KNOW will take it because they are hungry. If the comments were any indication of the state of the business, i would sugguest new management....... After all the burgers are damn good. Users/GregFurnish

20070619 01:41:40 nbsp I dont eat there that often, but I decided to go back and wait 40 minutes for a burger again.  Hey, I had some time to kill.  The burger was okay, but it had one of those plastic bread bag ties on my sandwich.  How in the world did that get there?  I dont think I pissed off any of the employees, but who knows.  Seasoned fries were good though. Users/BrentLaabs

20070620 17:12:37 nbsp After stopping there today, on the way from Sacto back to Santa Cruz, I felt compelled to post a comment.  We arrived (4 of us) at 11:50.  My companions received their food about 3035 minutes after the ordered, mine was about 45.  That was after I asked the front counter where my food was twice.  This was the worst burger I have ever had at this place, and I will not stop again.  The restaurant was not even busy!  At the price, $11.01 for a 1/4 pounder, fries, and shake, I expect good, decent food.  They handed me an overdone pattie, with a piece of cheese that wasnt even melted.  If I had had the time, I would have asked for another one.  There was another diner who was complaining right before me about waiting 45 minutes and not getting food.  Save some time and some money and go to In and Out.  The food is consistent and less expensive!  If anyone knows REDRUMs email, please post.  Id like for them to commend on how the place has gone downhill! Users/Larry

20070718 10:49:44 nbsp This place sucks ass the people who work there are all tools should be in a group home and food is overpriced sucks SUCKS BAD, what happened to good hole in the wall places with good food? this place just plain sucks ass Users/dickjones

20070804 03:41:24 nbsp wow this is the dirtiest restaurant i have ever ate at i am sorry but wow and the flies i totally lost my appitite Users/Brians

20070815 10:04:33 nbsp Despite going in there totally excited and really stoked about the menu and all the options, I was unimaginably disappointed with the food there. Im really hoping the halfinch charred fries, completely tasteless and plain burger with none of the stuff I asked for and all the stuff I asked them to leave off of it abundantly present is a fluke. Im trying to work up the openness to go back in there again, but the exorbitant prices and the terrible food I got there last time sort of put me off the place. Convince me though, and Ill go back. Its certainly got a reputation. I will say though, they had good local rags from Sac.  DanielMedinaCleghorn 

EXACTLY HOW I FEEL Users/KaiWan

20071030 12:07:16 nbsp Since moving to Davis five years ago, I have consistently hoped that Redrum would shape up into a dependable source for noncorporate food. Unfortunately, eating here continues to be a gamble. If executed correctly, their menu great: big burgers, any flavor shake you can imagine and some of the best fried food Ive ever had. But more often than not my order is wrong, the food is crappily prepared or the staff is so out of it (both in behavior and appearance) that I actually dont want to eat what Ive ordered. The owner seems so intent on differentiating himself from InNOut that I cant help but wonder what hes smoking. Hand written menus are cool, but not if they were taped to the wall 15 years ago. And where does he do his hiring? Methodone clinics? Users/JewpiterJones

20071214 19:55:33 nbsp Love their shakes, although they are on the pricey side.  Oreo shakes  ^_^ Users/BenShmidt

20071217 19:20:59 nbsp Id rather eat at places where most of the employees arent excons and wash their hands before making and serving my meals. Users/thelonepiper555

20080101 10:10:58 nbsp This place is very dirty employees are very rude dirty and scum try to avoid this place
 Users/Brians

20080120 23:23:49 nbsp This place is DIRTY!  My friends brother used to work there, and he will never eat there because he doesnt trust the food.  That tells you something!! Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080125 17:57:37 nbsp I dont much care for the place, there use to be two people there that were obviously on drugs, all they did was fight while they were working in front of everyone, not good for business! It is filthy! The owner is a known drug addict and hires drug addicts! Who would want one of them feeding our children?! I tried to go back because I use to really like the food years ago, I was happy to hear they had fired the one rude drugged out lady that used to work there, think her name started with a L, lisa or somthing. Wake up Jim, you have rude discusting people out front working for you your place will slowly go to pot! Users/roni

Hey guess what f you roni. I work at this place and i am no drug addict ok? Honestly how can you say that all the people who work at this place is a drug addict? I am also not rude or DISGUSTING I have never once been blatantly rude to any customers, it is bad business! If anything I try to level with customers at all costs, and honestly it is customer attitudes that have a lot to do with customer experiences! The place has a weird reputation, but that doesnt speak for everyone who has or is ever going to work there.

20080211 22:24:36 nbsp I just ate here a few days ago... I would NEVER want to go back again. the food tasted plain and the workers were rude. this place is so dirty. the back door from the parking felt like it was about to break down. the burger they gave me had so much mustard i stop had to stop eating. the workers do look like they were high. nothing look cleaned :(.
i will not be going to the place again. hope all is well. Users/ChiYang

20080212 00:28:06 nbsp expensive but good Users/cobugi

20080212 00:29:49 nbsp i thot the people who worked there were extremely nice. me friend even commented saying we need more places like these. Users/cobugi

20080217 21:27:35 nbsp Ate here recently.  Pretty good, although nothing remarkable. Kind of pricey, and the place isnt excatly sparkling clean, but the staff was nice enough.  Be prepared for a wait though.  Users/CindyBanh

20080218 18:27:17 nbsp Peanut butter milkshake is to die for. Users/AlexPerkins

20080219 20:20:45 nbsp I ordered 2 milkshakes and bbq fries tonight.  The bbq fries were fine, but the milkshakes I got were really really watered down.  Are they even supposed to put water in milkshakes!?  Anyways, on my previous milkshake orders, it was fine, but this time it was watered down.   Users/BenLee

20080407 nbsp My experience was eh.  It is quite rundown inside.  I dont mind regular wear and tear since I like cities and holeinthewall type places, but yeah, I wouldnt take outoftowners to this place to make a good impression.  I will say that the variety of burgers and sandwiches is good.  Maybe its best to grab the food togo and eat it at a park or something.    Users/YupYup

  I totally agree. I ate there with my parents and the door in the back slams when it shuts. It was so annoying while  we were eating. The food was really good, but the place really needs some fixing up. Users/BrandonBarrette

Hey people, that door got fixed! yay no more gunblasts in your ear while your eating!

20080803 17:06:34 nbsp I was pretty disappointed when they stopped greasing up their buns. Their burger just lost that fatty essence taste. I would rather go across the street and get more of an affordable meal.  Users/AvidSpots

20080903 15:34:01 nbsp I have been going to this place for lunch about twice a week,walking distance where i work.The service is good and people who work there are great.I found that the Chicken Malibu is the best,i am hooked. Users/jasen

20080903 15:43:23 nbsp I dont get why people consider this place in the same league as Inandout.  They are completely different types of places.  Del Taco sells burgers, but I wouldnt compare them to Inandout or Murder Burger.  Plus, Inandout is a cookie cutter burger joint with preformed everything and they are constantly getting customers, so they dont really stop cooking.  I dont get why anyone would compare them to anything other than perhaps Wendys. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080903 16:08:34 nbsp I love Murder Burger, and I would eat here a lot more often if I didnt care as much about my health. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20080921 21:25:19 nbsp I hear rumours that Redrum might be shutting down? Can anyone attest to the validity?  Users/ArianeMetz
 They probably are valid, but Redrum is like the phoenix. It has shutdown several times before I think.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081005 12:32:42 nbsp Rating the food is easy: I had a tasty burger that was sitdown restaurant quality at a shortorder dive.  Big meat patty with good flavor and great ingredients (the lettuce was shredded though, that kinda sucked.)  A 1/2 lb burger is about $6.00 and with fries and a drink it comes to around $10.00.  So I paid about the same what it would have been in a Chilis or some chain sitdown.  Expect to pay about $814 for a visit.

The staff was two people when I went: a cashier and a cook.  So when I saw the people in front of us order a lot, we knew thered be a wait.  It took maybe 20 minutes for two burgers, a fries, onion rings, a shake and a soda.  Not terrible but after reading how the wait would be long, we just grabbed newspapers to read.  Give them a break  for one cook I think he did a good job.

The cashier forgot my soda, and a friendly reminder seemed to be a hassle for him.  Blackberry shake was good, but we both expected them to use blackberries and not blackberry flavored syrup.  My fries were pretty flavorless and soggy.  My girlfriends onion rings were huge, crunchy and tasty  too much batter is debatable.  The burgers were excellent but had me feeling greasy and overly full afterwards.  The buns are a bit too big for my taste and I didnt want to fill up on that much bread.

 Users/GeorgeDrake

20081110 13:48:01 nbsp ive only been there once and i suspect thats my last time

their burger was mediocre in taste, and their chili cheese fries tasted like a bean salad with fries on top Users/fredchen

20081130 10:56:38 nbsp

The good:

Tasty (if extremely greasy) fries.
The Ostrich burger is supposedly healthier than cow burgers.
It tastes something like a cow burger and something like a turkey burger.
The servers were polite and efficient.

The in between:

The burger that I had was OK, although not anything special.
For the same price, you could get a much better burger at Burgers and Brew (although likely with a longer wait).
For less money, you could get an equally tasty burger from InnOut across the street.
Actually, you could get InnOuts fries too and still be spending less than you would pay for a burger alone at Redrum.
The ostrich burger comes with some tasty topics on it.
Burgers take about 10 minutes, although I saw some orders come out in about 6 and others, well, I got and ate my order well before those customers (who ordered before me) got their order.

The bad:

The person who took my order smelled VERY strongly of cigarette smoke.  Yuck!
The place was filthy.  Trash and food on the tables.  Trash and food on the floor.  Yuck!  While I did see someone come by and clean up at one point, this apparently isnt occurring frequently enough to keep the place clean.
Seating is very limited.  Perhaps this contributes to the concentration of trash and food on the tables, since everyone has to sit at one of only a few tables.  I had a hard time finding a place to sit that was not covered in something that I didnt want to sit near (and there was still trash at my feet).  If there are a bunch of people here, it may be hard to find a place to sit at all.
The tasty toppings on the ostrich burger include cheese and some sort of sauce.  This may cancel out the reduced fat in the ostrich burger.

On the IDoNotExist Sushimeter, this place scores a 0, as it does not serve sushi.  On the IDoNotExist Burgermeter, which scores burgers on a scale of burger goodness from absolutely zero burgers to burger bliss, this place scores a 5 out of 10.

Id really have to think twice (or three times) about coming here again.  OK, but unhealthy food.  Gross eating environment. Users/IDoNotExist

20090426 01:43:45 nbsp Awesome burgers ever!!!  The appearance of Redrums exterior first turned me off, so I never went in (was kinda afraid)and had gone to InNOut instead.  However, I got a gift card and tried them out for the first time and really really enjoyed their burger and fries.  I had the 1/3 lb burger with the chipotle mayonnaise and it was delicious.  I like the extra spice and would recommend the special addage for those who like spicy food.  Its not that spicy, but it offers good flavoring.  Their fries are the best Ive had in a long time, it was crispy and had a good taste to it unlike other restaurants fries that are salty and bland.  I highly recommend this place.  I even prefer it over Burger and Brew.  cost are similar, but the burger here taste so much better.      Users/kikao

20090531 03:06:11 nbsp i champion the zoom. my particular favorite are the fried mushrooms. the order is great to pickup with friends and goes perfect with beer. Users/NickKory

20090621 00:56:27 nbsp I remember having pretty pleasant experiences here (a couple of times) until the turkey burger. Not a fan.  Users/Babhari

20090717 03:03:26 nbsp Ive always had very good service here. They may be a bit slow, but theyre a good sight faster than driving out to Citrus Heights for Fuddruckers. All in all, this is where I go when I want something better than Carls Jr. but not as expensive as Burgers and Brew. Users/JoePomidor

20090909 14:59:43 nbsp Ive always had decent to above average experiences here, its quite expensive but its within easy riding distance of campus and the food is good.  The wait is a bit of a pain but you can easily order ahead and avoid it (Nobody with a cellphone should complain about the wait here).  I frequent the mushroom burger and the nacho fries, both of which are guaranteed to make your arteries look like I80 just before the causeway when heading out of sacramento during rush hour.  This might be a problem for some people but if Im taking the time to head to the other side of the tracks I expect nothing less of my food, and anyone who takes a look at the exterior of this joint and doesnt expect super greasy middle america style food theyre a bit more than misguided.  This place is awesome, just make sure to expect a bit of the tattoo subculture and bring your antacid tablets. Users/OlinHannum

20090914 22:12:20 nbsp ive been looking forward to having another burger here for a long time now, and I finally had the chance to be in the area last night, but sadly I was disappointed by what I had.  I got the same thing I got last time because it was amazing before, but this time around it wasnt as good.  I dont know if they got a new cook or if there was a change in cook, but the hamburger meat wasnt cooked very well and it didnt have as much flavor as before, the special sauce wasnt as tasty, the fries werent as crispy and flavorfull as I remembered, and what topped off the bad experience was that I was given the wrong soda(realized that after I got on the road cause I ordered to go)not only was it the wrong flavored soda, but they gave me dietyuck. Users/kikao

20090920 01:17:37 nbsp Had an ostrich burger today, its good, for a noncookie cutter place. Its true the actual place is a little drab, but the cashier was nice and my order only took some 510 minutes (taking into account 2 orders before myself). Its a bit on the expensive side, but a burger and fries fills you up nicely. Users/elliotgoethe

20091009 23:31:19 nbsp wow ok so i have a huge problem w/ all this.... redrum is NOT fast food..... it is good food.... unlike mc ds they dont microwave their burgers... they use half the grill to grill the burgers and the other half to toast the buns so they can only bust out burgers so fast... if you ever pay attention to their service that is why three orders come out at the same time one after another... as for dirty this is so false they clean for hours at closing and try to keep clean during the day but can only do so much if they are really busy because the cashier that is taking your orders is responsible for the front dinning area .... try not being slobs and the place would stay nicer... also none of them do hard drugs and there isnt a single person who is an excon there might be some jail time under one or two ppls belt but it is for minor things like drinking and driving.... normal things... and they dont try to be rude to the customers.... they just have personality god forbid someone poke fun at you when you do something obviously stupid..... listen to the conversations between the employees everyone gets treated the same.... they treat you like they do fellow employees.... if you ask a dumb question like  Is there cheese on my burger?  when it is posted on the board and on another sign w/ some mouse on it of course they will be real and tell you duh... it real ppl not ppl who are going to kiss your ass and i know for one i have been in there and ordered fries and they gave me the size larger... or some small thing like that was just a cool thing to do.... and the fries are AMAZING... they dont water down the shakes but if there are alot of previous shake orders the shakes become runny... and of course burgers, and fries, and FRIED onion rings are going to be greasy they are fried in grease.... if you dont want a long wait come by on a week day or call ahead... if you call ahead all you have to do is wait for fries becase they try to make them fresh and crispy for you.... if your a interested in a good burger try this place....  Users/chillout....

20091020 19:26:29 nbsp ok we just came from there, first time. is their ZOOM supposed to be soft and spongy batter? i mean it was SO THICK and the only crispy parts were where the batter thinned out and made little offshoots. i have left a whole container full of soft squishy breading. is that right? also their burger with the garlic mayo was kind of flavorless, and again, HUGE thick bun, wayyyyyy too much bread. their fresh banana shake was good tho! Users/StephHolm

20091118 14:38:57 nbsp I tried this and unfortunately, I am not impressed. Id choose Burgers & Brew over this place any day!  Plus, after reading the comment below about an employee of this place not wanting to eat here grosses me out (because it does look pretty unsanitary in there).  The guy who works the counter though is really nice.  This place is OK to me, but it sure does have a lot of fans (it was packed when I went there). Users/ElizabethLee

20091214 17:40:46 nbsp TERRIBLE! Thats why its always empty. It poses as one of those neat little burger joints where you can get a better meal for a better price but its expensive. DONT get the fires, theyre limp and soggy, and the burgers take 10 minutes to cook while the hipsters inside take cigarette breaks and they dont season the beef and only put mayo on a french role which makes it soggy again. Users/slappy

20100201 13:37:58 nbsp This restaurant has been part of Davis for a very long time however on the 5 or 6 occasions Ive been here Ive never been impressed with the food and Ive always found the service extremely incompetent and hostile.  I really have no idea how this place stays in business considering that they apparently train their staff to show as much hostility to customers as possible.  Oh and the prices suck.

Really there is never, ever a reason to go here.  If you want a fast food burger, pay less at In n Out, if you want a nicer burger pay about the same and get better food and less snark at Habitat. Users/rfrazier

20100201 17:09:11 nbsp pumpkin milkshakes! SO good.  Users/randomstudent

20100201 19:19:45 nbsp I went to regruB redruM today for the first time in a long time and though Ill admit the normal burgers are nothing to write home about, their fries are better than innouts. The guy taking orders was very nice too. If youre not in a huge hurry, (at least a 10 minute wait when the place is empty) its alright. Users/ARWENNHOLD

20100204 09:01:15 nbsp I dont know who the current owner is but the owner 2 years ago was rude and idiotic. I just wanted an order of fried zuccinni for lunch one work day. I got my order and went back to work to discover my zuccinni was completely burned. It looked too dark and smelled awful. I called back to complain about my food and wanting a refund but the guy who answered the phone said the owner made the zuccinni and the owner KNEW it was done right. I begged to differ. I was offered another order instead of my money back (nice that they ruin my lunch and do NOTHING to compensate for that) and have yet to redeem my free food. Think Id still be able to get my overly battered, very greesy and very burnt zuccinni replacement? I doubt it. If the owner is that much of an idiot and cant make food, I worry for the staff he trains.. Users/mzp0p

20100214 19:27:31 nbsp The food was really greasy.  Both me and my roommate didnt feel so hot after finishing the half pound burger. Users/DaveG

20100331 22:53:33 nbsp hello im just a kid and i love murder burger and ive only had it once in my life and i had the ostrich burger it was darn good i love that place and im going tommorow and i know in n out burger is great but give it a try its so good and u dont like it then thats fine but i do and others do to so dont add negative comments and ruin it for the rest of us  Users/deek

20100421 16:45:50 nbsp These burgers are VERY filling! They are typical meaty, greasy, goodness that leave you stuffed and with an aching stomach. I agree with other commenters that the place can be a little slow but if you are looking for artery clogging yumminess these are some of the most homemade tasting burgers in Davis. Users/KenichiSan

20100506 18:18:27 nbsp The quality of the place varies from year to year, depending greatly upon the current staff. Since this is usually students, they will often have new staff in six months. Youll either have mediocre and blah, or pretty darned good. Its ALWAYS a little slow, though: those thick patties take time to cook through..

The building could definately use some renovation and renewal, though. Its as old as anything else on Olive, and shows it. Users/Flynn

20100630 16:54:53 nbsp I agree that the facility needs some sprucing up. I dont like to eat there because it seems dirty.  Whitey Jolly Kone in West Sac is the best.  They close every year for December.  Part vacation and part to repaint and touch up every year.   Users/LokiAbbi

20100912 01:22:34 nbsp This was one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Davis, and I thought the burgers were delicious, but I was not a fan of the fries. I also thought the service was good. The wait is longer than Im used to, but considering how thick the meat patties are, I would rather wait the extra time than receive a pink burger. Oh yeah, Redrum Burger is nothing like InNOut burger, nor is InNout anything like Wendys.  Users/jwieland1989

20101011 18:30:43 nbsp The very best place in the entire world to clog your arteries.  :)  I know, its fast food, not health food.  SO...if you want to be bad this is the BEST place!  Their burgers are superbas are the very generous portions of fries.  Their shakes are REAL shakes too.
Vegetarian recommendation: the mushroom burger.  There is no burger, its just a huge pile of yummy mushrooms and cheese served on a bun. Users/toriac

20101229 17:05:04 nbsp Get the garlic fries if you want a big two pound glob of grease filled with half cooked potatoes. Yum! We probably ate 1/10th of the serving.  Users/DavidFeliz
