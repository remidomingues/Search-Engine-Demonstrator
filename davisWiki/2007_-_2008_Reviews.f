APEX Cycles & Service/2007  2008

20071024 15:28:35 nbsp I bought a nice used road bike it was in perfect condition i got a great deal after my wifes was stolen, This  place is awesome and free tuneups if buy a bike there very cool and excellent costumer service i will be back often. Thank you very much From Brian & Diane Users/Brians

20071102 15:03:21 nbsp Excellent service and adorable family. Aaron fixed my flat tire in minutes (unlike other shops that wanted me to wait 12 hours). Unbeatable prices as well 10% discount for students! I would highly recommend it and will go back there every time. Users/Nicole1985

20071120 16:43:19 nbsp Just brought in my flat tire to get repaired. Aaron (I presume), deftly fixed it within minutes and was very friendly. Prices are competitive so I definitely recommend this place to anybody with need of bike services. Users/egyan

20080203 15:51:33 nbsp Aaron rebuilt the drive train (new bottom bracket, cranks chain ring and back cog) on my early 1970s red fixed gear Peugeot and it runs great.  I couldnt be any happier with it.  Before I found Apex Cycles (I am new to Davis as of the Summer of 07) I had a few other bike shops try to fix my broken chain ring, bottom bracket and cranks.  They all gave up and told me to scrap my beloved frame and get a new bike.  Aaron was able to remove the old French bottom bracket and cut new threads for a more modern external barring type bottom bracket.  He then put new Shimano cranks, chain ring and a quality Soma back cog on my bike and it is awesome.  I always make sure to go to Aaron for any repairs work I need done on my fixed gear Peugeot. Users/albertobob

20080211 08:53:42 nbsp Very highly recommended.  The owner, Aaron, was kind enough to set up a Sunday appointment for me, even though it wasnt a huge job.  This is a smaller bike shop than the others, and  you feel more like a personal client than just a customer: they give you and your bike their 100% undivided attention and are superfocused on getting your bike exactly the way you want it to be.    Users/bikelover

20080404 19:56:42 nbsp I had a wonderful experience at this store. I took in a couple of beach cruisers earlier this week to fix some small things and add some accessories. He told me the bikes would be ready today and they were. I first came to this store and asked a million questions and got them all answered with a patient attitude. I walked around to 3 other bike stores located downtown and got very similar price quotes from all of them. I decided to get the work done here because of the helpfulness of the owner (who does most of the sales and work himself) and because of the 10% student discount. He fixed a flat, aligned a tire, added a kickstand, added a rack and two rear baskets, added a front basket, added two front lights, modified the handles, cleaned the bikes, and oiled my chain. He did all of this and charged me only 40 dollars for 40 minutes of labor. I thought this was a very fair price. After the sale he even lowered the seat on one of the bikes with a smile. The only downside about this store is that it is very small and does not have a huge stock of parts/accessories. If you need to buy something and have it installed sameday, this may not be the place for you. If youre willing to wait, then he can order just about anything and have it within a day or two. All in all this guy charges fair prices (especially for students), does good/fast work, and will give you straight answers without any BS trying to get you to buy stuff you dont need. Thanks Aaron! We love our bikes and will definitely return for future cycling needs. Users/BlairGoss

20080418 21:43:09 nbsp owner is friendly. bought some bike supplies today. i will be back for any bike related needs. Users/kelvinkay

20080609 08:11:40 nbsp Aaron did a great job resurrecting my 20 yearold Trek road bike.  He did a great job replacing and adding what we discussed.  I felt he made a conscious effort to steer me toward what I needed and what was most costefficient.  He picked it up on a Friday and dropped it off the next Tuesday.  I was very happy with the service and the cost was reasonable. Users/BigGuy

20080627 nbsp Aaron did a good job building an older Bridgestone frame into a finished fixed gear/single speed bike.  He answered all my questions, and built the bike in only a few days (talked with him Saturday, it was ready on Tuesday).  He even gave a student discount on the lock and lights that I bought separately.  I really like riding this bike around town, and will go back to APEX Cycles in the future.

20080628 00:24:55 nbsp Aaron sold me a fixed gear road bike and he changed it to a single speed road bike as I requested. He didnt charge me any money except for the parts :D. He worked quite fast and very promising. I am very happy with my purchase. Great guy to talk to :D. He gave me discounts. Ask if you want a discount, he is willing to give you a discount if you just ask. Users/phuneverdie

20080717 18:56:06 nbsp I just called Aaron and the same day, he came over and fixed my flat tire within minutes. He was very friendly and did an awesome job! I recommend him to everyone!! Users/akwiat11

20080809 21:00:35 nbsp Definitely better than all the other bike stores around Davis. Nice and timely.  Users/dbrand

20080820 15:27:34 nbsp Just bought a couple things off Aaron (store owner), I actually got a really good deal comparable to the other stores in Davis and even online. If anybody rides a fixed gear, you should go to him and talk to him about it. I got a new tire and at Freewheeler it was 39.99 + Tax, Wheelworks it was around the same but at APEX, I got for 29 including tax. He has student discounts so word. Users/btt

20080820 18:05:46 nbsp Really awesome place to go get your bike fixed or just to buy parts. The owner is really nice and knows his bikes very well. The service is also very fast and students get a discount! Users/Ray916

20080822 12:11:42 nbsp Took my old piece of crap in, and Aaron was really helpful, getting my wheel back in true in about 15 minutes.  Really nice guy, too. Users/JoshuaSchraiber

20080909 21:14:03 nbsp YAAAA grand re opening

do you do work on old ass moultens? specifically a 4 speed sturmey where I broke the little axle thingy... I have a moulten from the early 60s with full suspension that actually works great. Users/StevenDaubert

20080910 08:03:48 nbsp This place is awesome the owner is a class act! He the owner has a great worker named Simon great mechanic and darn good person, If you want a great fixie or just a repair this place is second to no one!! Users/Brians

20080913 15:52:30 nbsp Apex does a great job with repairs and tuneups. They really work with you to make sure that you are satisfied with the result. If you need any major repairs done, this is definitely the place to go. If you are just looking for parts, on the other hand, some of the prices here are high ($6.99 for a set of two plastic tire levers). Users/CameronTracy

      Just a note about the tire levers... If you ever break one of the Pedros levers mentioned above, we will replace the lever for free for life (No other shop does that.).  Also, a portion of the profits goes to Breast Cancer research, hence the Pink color, the Yellow ones go to Lance Armstrongs Livestrong foundation, Orange goes to Davis Community Meals, and the green ones go to IMBA (International Mtn. Bike Association) to improve local riding trails.  We do have cheaper levers (Black) for $2.99 to $4.99 based on quality.  Just ask.  Thanks for stopping by. Users/Aaron.Curtin

          Oh, that explains it. Also, I forgot to mention how fast the repairs are. The last time I took my bike in a tuneup, derailleur adjustment, rear brake assembly replacement, and tire change took a single day. This is much faster than some of the other options in Davis. Also, the shop recently moved and the new location is a bit difficult to find, but I would highly recommend checking it out.Users/CameronTracy

20080917 14:29:39 nbsp Late last night, I was searching for a good reliable bike repair place in town and found all these nice reviews for Apex.  I emailed them a question last night and this morning (before 8am), I got a prompt email response.  I brought the bike in this morning and Aaron fixed it while I waited (the chain needed adjustment) and he didnt charge me anything for this!  This is clearly the bike shop that I will recommend to everyone I know (starting with this post on daviswiki)!  Thanks Aaron! Users/joonglee

20080919 22:21:09 nbsp Dont shop around  just go see Aaron. Friendly, knowledgeable, and reliable...  Im bicycle repair impaired, and it is very obvious... I asked about a million questions Aaron was happy to answer all of them. Princess is super nice, too.  Users/MichellePalmer

20080929 12:22:28 nbsp I purchased a bike here a few weeks ago and had a great experience. Super nice staff, great local business. I wont use another bike shop again!!  Users/AshleyTeodorsonVau

20081008 12:46:58 nbsp Great service, superfast, emailed the night before and Aaron took my bike in the next day when the Bike Barn said they wouldnt take it for a month. Friendly, knowledgeable, good price  definitely the first place Ill take my bike in the future! Users/evureyday

20081103 18:03:03 nbsp Best mechanics out there. Simion is the man when it comes to precise repairs. You dont need to go anywhere else! Users/KateKat

20081107 16:48:43 nbsp apex is legit. thats all i have to say. Users/MiranPark

  Word. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081130 19:17:12 nbsp Are you slowing down? Feel like peeping the moulten? Users/StevenDaubert

20081209 13:38:57 nbsp The Bike Barn has more fixie stuff and at better prices!! Users/shorty

    In response to this comment... I have the best prices in town on Fixed Gear stuff, no shop in Davis or Sac comes close (Especially the Bike Barn).  As for having more stuff, I believe in quality over quantity... where else can you get Toshi straps, MKS GR9 pedals, Phil Wood hubs or EAI Super Star Gold Medal Cogs in town and not get ripped off.  If you really need good parts and accessories, I cant be beat.  Ill always match a price on the same part from a local shop, but Ive NEVER had to do that in over 2 years in business.  I will match prices with Sac shops to save you a drive to Sacramento.  To the poster using the name shorty, I would ask you to come in and try to do a price comparison and see for yourself.Users/Aaron.Curtin

20081230 20:29:53 nbsp Apex is a wonderful resource for anyone trying to learn more about their bicycle, regardless of its variety. I was interested in buying a fixed gear for campus/local use and Aaron and some of the fixed gearheads that hang out there have really helped me a lot. Aaron cators to the needs of students of all price ranges and provides a super comfortable environment for you to ask questions and learn more about your gear. I am endlessly appreciative for the assistance that Aaron has given me in ordering and building my Leader, Thanks :D Users/Deuces
