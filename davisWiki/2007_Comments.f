20070112 10:19:09 nbsp The cheese selection is excellentthis is the only place in Davis Ive been able to find Spanish blue. Users/LynnetteWharton

20070117 10:11:26 nbsp I dont go here much because the inexpensive milks (2 for $4.30) use rBGH (sometimes called puss milk) Users/BillAlexander

20070130 13:30:05 nbsp Nuggets coffee bar makes the best americano in all of Davis.  Im totally addicted. Users/AmandaCaudle

20070203 13:34:49 nbsp Im not sure why so many of the comments here are about the prepared food rather than the shopping. I was a Trader Joes patron back in San Diego and have found that the Nugget is the closest I have found to TJs in Davis. Prices are comparable to Albertsons etc. if not cheaper and the food is usually better (ie. more gourmet or just interesting selections a la Trader Joes). The atmosphere is infinitely better than most grocers and the checkers are usually very personable. Just my two cents, still would like to see a Trader Joes in Davis. Users/AnthonySoto

20070228 18:42:02 nbsp My grocery store of choice. Doesnt always have the best deals, but they have quality foods and superior wine and beer selection (very important). My only complaint is that their parking lot is always filled with seemingly the worst minivan/SUVdriving soccer moms in Davis who couldnt perform a 3point turn to save their honor student. Users/BriannaBetancourt

Is this stereotyping of part of the Davis community really necessary? Those soccer moms are probably highly educated woman with careers and families. Not an easy job.  Users/JimEvans

20070306 13:11:52 nbsp i used to go here exclusively for the chinese food. when the north davis location first opened, the chinese food was cheap, plentiful, and of decent quality. not long after, the quality went down considerably (most notably the quality of meat they use). i still went, because it was cheap, and i could get about 2 meals out of it (id get the combo that got rice, chow mein and an entree). then they raised all of the prices by at least $1. i still contunued to go there, because at least it was a reasonable price for essentially 2 meals. I went today, and to my dismay, the combo that i usually got was less than half the size of what it used to be, and still at the same price, and mediocre quality. needless to say, i will never be getting the chinese food there again. I realized, for about a dollar less, I can get the lunch combo at silver dragon (which is comparable to the combo i used to get at nugget), and you get a much larger portion, and MUCH MUCH better quality Users/JeffIto

20070319 13:41:35 nbsp The nugget in Woodland has raised the price of their basic chinese rice bowl (white/brown rice + 1 entree) to $4.29.  I dont know if Davis Nugget has followed.  This makes it a total of a 43% price raise in the last year an a half. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070427 13:19:38 nbsp I am rather fed up with all of the solicitors that they have outside of their entries and exits.  It seems like every other day they have someone there begging you to buy stuff or sign a petition.  Dammit, I just wanna get my groceries in peace.  Is that too much to ask?   Users/CaseyBarc

The Girl Scouts? A Little League team? A petition drive? Is it really so terrible if you have to interact with other people in your community. Users/JimEvans

20070520 15:14:49 nbsp Ooookay first I wanna know if Mr. JimEvans is here to simply RAG on peoples assertions (which were pretty funny), or if hes going to share something worthwhile about the NUGGET; that IS the topic at hand. ANYHOO  I think that when it comes to the Nugget vs. Albertsons you have a Mercedes vs. a Honda. Both are GOOD products, but ones a little nicer than the other. I like the checkout and attractivelydisplayed produce at the front of the store. Dare I say it? Yep  hella cute. LOL Users/joeistheish

  Constructive? OK. If you want to buy a loaf of Ciabatta on a week day dont bother going in the morning. Its not out until after about 10am, which can be a pain if you like shopping in the morning. After CaseyBarc made a similar antisocial comment on the Coop page I held my tongue. Alright? Users/JimEvans

20070525 17:46:34 nbsp I am addicted to the Nuggets sushi!  I dont know how they manage to maintain such fresh sushi in a display case, but its consistently better than Nobu Hiro or Fuji.
 Users/BillyBudd

nbsp Nuggets sushi is made fresh everyday. They never have day old sushi sitting out. Also, Nugget sells so much sushi its hard to buy sushi thats been sitting in the case all day long. Users/mowtov


20070628 19:21:54 nbsp I love the Nugget!  I have never stood in a line for more than a few seconds here.  Their products seem much fresher than Safeways. And, the employees here are excellent. Users/Chantal

20070630 21:14:30 nbsp Generally, I dont shop much here because of the high prices, with the exception of a few items that I cant get anywhere else. But the bakery items are hard to resist... especially chocolate chip cookies, lemon bars, and Ã©clairs... Users/CovertProfessor

20070704 06:14:30
Whats up with those babes with the baskets up on the Nugget prison wall? What are they going to drop on the oblvious masses? Pastripe product? Demeters Revenge upon Hades? ?WilyFerret

20070715 07:15:00 nbsp Quite simply the best supermarket in Davis. With few exceptions their produce is much fresher than those of Safeway and have a much greater variety (I like trying new vegetables, or being able to get Chinese Long Beans if I want). When I was craving some softshelled crab a few years ago they special ordered some for me without any reservation. Best of all is the service at the Nugget...the employees for the most part seem to really like working here. For example, on a rainy day last winter I was walking from the store back to my car, and unsolicited an employee told me to watch out a couple feet ahead of me because the puddles were deceptively deep. Now I realize what he did wasnt so hard but its the frequency of little touches like this that make me come to the Nugget a few times a week.  Users/AlvinTsao

20070717 13:42:46 nbsp The sandwiches are way over priced, The store is meant for the wealthy, they do have a great loss prevention team i will say that if try to take from this store i guarantee you get caught, nice people do work there they are very help full i just cant seam to go there to often the deals are nor deals but great place to work and be safe that is for sure  Users/dickjones

20070717 14:20:57 nbsp The pricing seems to be a bit variable, but my family started shopping at Nugget (north) because several of our regular items (Genova frozen ravioli and the wiki:sacramento:Sacramento Baking Company sourdough to name a couple) are a bit cheaper here. Weve also found that the ground pork here is excellentmuch better than the variety offered at Safeway. Another findingand this has made the extra distance worth itis the fact that the purified water dispensers a) all work regularly and b) are seemingly never crowded (again, compared to the South Davis Safeway). Bummer running to the market late at night to get water, only to find two dispensers down and the remaining two restocking themselves. We still shop at Safeway frequently (how can we not when it is so convenient?), but seem to be going to Nugget more and more. Users/KevinChin

20070723 19:25:35 nbsp As a foodie that shops at places like Whole Foods, Mothers Market, Mitsuwa and Ranch 99 for Seafood, its true that Nugget isnt the cheapest but its got high quality foods (Triple cream cheeses) thats really tastes great and makes food shopping an experience. Users/atwong

20071107 23:34:48 nbsp I think talanted Davisites should try to win some free beef: http://nuggetbeef.com/ Users/GregWebb
