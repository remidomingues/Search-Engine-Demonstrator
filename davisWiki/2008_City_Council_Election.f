The 2008 City Council Election was held on June 3rd, 2008.  Three seats, held by Sue Greenwald, Don Saylor, and Stephen Souza, were open in this election.

Students who live in campusproper (e.g. not Cuarto/Castilian Hall area) are not eligible to vote in city elections as UC Davis is not technically a part of the city of Davis. Davis College Democrats have created a Davis College Democrats/City Council Candidates Questionnaire, 2008 questionnaire for the Democratic candidates for city council.

This is the first Davis City Council Election since 1956 with three open seats and three incumbents running for reelection to those seatsFootNote(http://groups.dcn.org/davishistory/11davishistoryasawhole/citycouncilcandidatesandvotingresults19172006.).

20080603 10:52:29 nbsp EVEN if you dont vote for city council or judge, please vote Proposition NoYes; Against 98, For 99.
Personal statement  Prop 98 is a questionable, hiddenagenda attempt to support those who own lots of property at the expense of governments and tennants.  Why else would they hide the abolition of future rent control and some renters rights behind an aggressive property rights front.  Prop 99 may be weak, but it is safe.

Consider the proponents and opponents:
FOR 98  Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Association (aka the All Government is Bad committee)
 not 99   Cal Farm Bureau
          Lots of developers with big advertising budgets
AGAINST 98  League of Women Voters
   & pro99   California Police Chiefs Assn
              AARP  CA state president
              National Wildlife Federation (and others)
              Consumer Federation of California

But mathematically...

21.3% + 20.3% + 17.8% + 15.4% + 13.2% + 12.1%  100.1%

interesting... Users/AlexNelson

   Its okay, rounding off can make them work that way.  34.54 + 12.54 + 9.54 + 43.38  100.  Round it off at the nearest tenth, and you get 34.5 + 12.5 + 9.5 + 43.4  99.9.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
