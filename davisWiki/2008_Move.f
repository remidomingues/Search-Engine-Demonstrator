The See No Evil Hear No Evil eggheads were set to be moved to Mrak roundabout. Rather than what was originally cited by the http://blogs.ucdavis.edu/egghead/2008/03/11/eggheadssettowakeupandmove/ egghead blog, this pair of The Eggheads eggheads sat in storage for some time before moving to the final location.

Another, more thorough http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id10105 article describes the move in more detail. The delay in the new home for the eggheads was planned as they awaited the preparation of their new home. Landscaping was done on the Mrak roundabout to emulate the original setting. New 6 grass hills were fashioned (the old ones which were 10 in height). The tops were prepared as a permanent home for the new eggheads.
