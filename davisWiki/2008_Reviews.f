20080101 17:52:20 nbsp In regards to CovertProfessors comment about the MSG, I had a chance to chat with Mr. Lee while I was waiting for food on a weekend in early May. My parents were coming into town to visit and my mother is allergic to MSG. Mr. Lee told me that they do add MSG in their food but they can take it out upon request for the dishes as they are made to order. Items that are made in the morning such as the beef noodle soup have MSG in it whether you like it or not as it is something that cannot be changed on the fly like the dishes. Though it still bothers me greatly that many of the Chinese restaurants in Southern California are removing MSG as an ingredient while many Chinese restaurants in Northern California still have not made the change.

20080218 18:20:11 nbsp I had Hometown for the first time today and ordered the Mixed Vegetables and the Curry Noodles Singapore Style.  I asked for no MSG and low oil and salt.  The owner told me not to worry.  He was true to his word and the food was fantastic.  The mixed vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, snow peas, carrots, and baked tofu) were sauteed in garlic and glazed lightly with gravy.  The noodles (the thin glassy variety) had a subtle curry flavor that did not overpower.  It was prepared with eggs, shrimp, marinated pork, and snow peas.  The menu indicates that it is a spicy dish, but it wasnt at all.  I loved that the owner made sure to prepare the dishes to our liking.  I was very pleased to see that there werent any pools of oil left on the plates after my sister and I cleaned them up.  I will definitely be returning. Users/QS

20080321 13:22:39 nbsp As I type I am enjoying my to go from Hometown Chinese. I biked there not too long ago and I have to say, it was WELL worth the bike. I ordered the pork chop on rice, but my order was mixed up and I got Hok meat instead. And I must say, it is DELICIOUS. Im definitely going back, maybe this time for dinner. I must say its AMAZING. Talk later, Im going to finish my meal! yum! Users/VTang

20080323 15:36:21 nbsp The beef noodle soup is the truth.  Authentic, just like my mom used to cook it. Users/tombrokaw

20080327 13:29:11 nbsp I eat here a lot, but I usually just order from their fast food.  Today I decided to order the Taiwanese Chicken Drumstick Over Rice b/c the picture above looked so tasty, and Ive gotta say, it was delicious!!  The meal comes with an entire takeout box full of rice with a meat gravy on top, a piece of fried tofu, one whole boiled egg (probably marinated in chinese five spice), vegetables, and a HUGE piece of fried chicken.  The flavors came together so nicely, and for $6.50, it was quite a steal.  I ordered the meal to go over the phone, and I when I arrived to pick up the food, everything was packaged and ready for me to go.  It was a very good experience, and Im still left with a takeout box full of food I hardly made a dent in!

Also, right now they have a special where you can buy 50 frozen dumplings for $16.  Great for a quick meal at home. Users/HeidiDris

20080427 07:59:55 nbsp I think next time Im within 100 miles of this place Ill have to drive up and eat!  Users/FrankYoung

20080502 22:30:59 nbsp Ordered the chicken drumstick over rice based off of heididris recommendation. and she is 100% absolutely right. tons of rice and meat gravy, piece of fried tofu, some great tasting string beans, a hardboiled soysauce marinated boiled egg (at least i think its soy sauce marinated...) and the drumstick of a monster chicken. no joke,  this chicken leg is so big that Jean couldnt close my take out box, so she had to get a rubber band and secure it tight. they always willing to go the extra mile for you, whether it be food quantity, quality, or just plain friendly service. love this place.

20080504 23:16:20 nbsp Contrary to everyone else I had a really bad experience. I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp and got what appeared to be shrimp & broccoli w. chilies no peanuts and very watery sauce. A couple hours later I got a really bad case of food poisoning. I probably wont be back. Users/DavidHolcomb

    David, we offer our sincere apologies.  The watery sauce was probably from the vegetables, and we no longer put peanuts in the Kung Pao Shrimp because so many of our customers are allergic to nuts.  Again, we are very sorry about your experience as our customer.  We hope we can make it up to you with a better dining experience if you decide to give us another chance.  Users/Steve&Jean

20080618 17:43:40 nbsp this place is the TRUTH Users/wesleywang

20080705 15:02:01 nbsp I like this place....good food.....beef noodle soup and fried rice are recommendations but the place seems really dirty. But what can u expect, its in a gas station. Trick with Chinese food is to not think about the back kitchen. Users/islandboy12

20080807 00:43:21 nbsp Good food, however I was unaware at the time that Hometown was not a fastfood restaurant, and so we waited 30 minutes or so for our meal. However, they were nice and courteous to us still. Definitely plan ahead if youre planning to eat at this place.  Users/EvelinaChang

20081026 18:31:01 nbsp the eggplant in garlic sauce is the shiz, no way around that. Users/CandiceWang
