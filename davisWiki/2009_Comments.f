20090126 15:41:53 nbsp I highly recomment Nugget for special occasion cakes.  Having forgotten about an office birthday, I went at the last minute to Nugget, hoping to find one of their delicious Carmel Apple cakes.  They didnt have any in the pastry case.  It was just before closing, but they promised I could pick one up the next morning at 9am.  I told them what to write and asked them to add a little soccer ball.  Well...not only was it ready on time, but they did an OUTSTANDING job decorating it, for no extra charge.  It had a large 3D soccer ball made of frosting, and little tufts of grass all around.  The writing was lovely.  I couldnt have been happier!  More importantly, my coworkers raved about the cake itself and asked where Id gotten it.  I will be back, for sure! Users/Linda

20090207 13:48:37 nbsp I love this store!!! Their sandwiches are to die for but their chinese food not so much. The people at checkout are always so kind. Even when im with my meathead boyfriend, they still ask me if i need help out to the car. Users/BettyBean

20090213 14:28:30 nbsp I have taken their low price survey about 5 times or so now, and they have won everytime...so that should dispell the notion that they are more expensive than Safeway, Raleys and Bel Air (the 3 competitors Ive used for my surveys). Maybe the notion that they are more expensive comes from their sandwiches or readytogo foods. Both are pricey, but lets be honest, its way better than Safeway or Raleys.  Users/AmLin

20090301 18:38:45 nbsp I love The Nugget but when I went to the one on Covell on Friday, they wouldnt accept my out of the area check and left my groceries there in the bags. My friend had to buy them for me, which was LAME. The stupid thing is that no more than 3 weeks ago, I went to the Nugget and paid with an out of the area check and it was fine. Fuck you, Covell Nugget! Users/JasonMasino
   People still pay for groceries with checks? Do you carry around a checkbook and everything? Users/KellyM
   I think nuggets check policy is laminated on the counter of every register, and even if it wasnt the store is allowed to enforce whatever policies they want regarding forms of payment. Just because you got away with breaking the policy once doesnt mean you are entitled to get away with breaking it every time. Also  did you try and do this again like 10 days later, because someone in front of me in line just a few days go was complaining about them not taking an out of area check and they left a whole cart full of groceries for the employees to put back.

20090512 16:02:58 nbsp I went to the Covell location on cinco de mayo to buy limes and margarita mix.  When I went to check out, the cashier asked to see my ID and refused to sell me the NONALCOHOLIC mix because I was under 21.  When I politely asked if it was some kind of store policy he rudely told me that no, it is the law.
It is certainly NOT against the law to buy a NONALCOHOLIC beverage.  I simply walked next store to longs and bought the exact same thing there.
Im done shopping at Nugget until they train their employees correctly to not turn away (and embarrass) customers who have done nothing wrong. Users/dijudy
  I have had the exact same thing happen to me at rite aid.  I highly doubt they were trying to embarrass you.  Perhaps there is in fact some law which we are unaware of regarding selling mixers to those under 21?  Or possibly people are just stupid.  I have no idea, and in you position would have asked to speak to the manager to resolve the issue. Users/MasonMurray
  I cant find any reference to any such law (which doesnt mean it doesnt exist  it is a law in some other states).  That said, often instore regulations are often just cited as being law by employees who dont know any better... they were just told not to sell them. jw
    I have checked into this. It is not expressly store policy, and the clerk was simply misinformed. I think there is some type of automated reminder to check ID when they scan anything from the liquor department.  And, as the margarita mix is from that part of the store, it comes up flagged. I got some from the North Davis Nugget a couple weeks ago, they asked for my ID, and I asked them to double check with the manager. They did, and sold me the drink mix with no problem.  Users/MasonMurray

20090531 19:05:25 nbsp Nugget is still my favorite store.  The service is wonderful.  And my daughter likes the Chinese food and I like not having to cook dinner. Users/HazelWatson

20090615 17:47:16 nbsp Nugget sandwiches are amazing. Salsalito turkey, basil aioli, muenster and a bunch of veggies on sliced sourdough is one of my favorite meals in Davis.

The rest of the store generally matches the sandwich counters awesomeness; the beer selection blows Safeway out of the water (putting it close to Coop). Users/JamesWaterhouse

20090616 19:19:22 nbsp This is the best grocery store in Davis. The produce, meat and delicatessen selections are huge and the quality is great. It is, however, expensive. An equivalent weekly shop for the two of us, anecdotally, costs about $30 less in Safeway. One question I have though... what on earth is the point of the Nugget card? It sure seems to be only to help Nugget track customers buying habits! I say this because after they logged our buying data for a year, we got a voucher for 50% off a $6.99 poinsettia . Is that all there is to it? If so, I dont see any reason to facilitate their stock optimization processes unrewarded. Users/Mazzle
  A few times a year (Ive never really paid attention to the timing, but every few months) I get a coupon in the mail for 5% off a future purchase.  I seem to remember the person who signed me up saying that the discount would be based on how much I spent during the time period.  I have no idea what those numbers were, but since I dont spend a ton, I would assume that someone shopping for a large family would likely get 10% or something.  Anyhow, 5% is not a huge payoff to let them track my spending, but I definitely got more than half off a $7 plant, and its worth it to me. Users/StaceyEllis

20090617 12:19:11 nbsp Dear Nugget Market Baggers and Cashiers:

Please stop smashing my fruits and vegetables!!!  If you want to smash produce and put it back on the shelf that is one thing, but once I have paid for the things in my shopping cart, they belong to me and as my property they should be treated as such.  If YOU had paid $5 for a bag of apples, or $4 for a bunch of bananas I know for a fact you wouldnt be smashing them.

Here are a few simple guidelines for bagging groceries.  If you cannot understand how to follow these rules, then please just get out of my way and let me bag my own groceries thanks:

1.  SOFT THINGS GO WITH OTHER SOFT THINGS.  Hard things with hard things, and heavy things with, thats right you guessed it, OTHER HEAVY THINGS.  Some heavy things just go it alone, because they are either too big for a bag, or too heavy, or would be a waste to bag at all.

2. If I have 3 canvas bags this does not mean all of my groceries should fit into them.  Sometimes I buy more, sometimes less, if I have more I would like some plastic bags.  If I have less you shouldnt put all of my groceries into one bag (see rule 1).

3. If I have a large canvas bag this doesnt mean you can load 20 lbs worth of groceries into ONE BAG.  I have to carry this from my car to my house and would prefer to have an even distribution of weight per bag.  To be honest you have no clue how people carry things home so you better pack in the most evenly distributed manner possible.

4. Layering is very important, as things come down the line put the heavier and more sturdy items in first and then lighter and more easily broken, bruised and squished items on top or last.  Watch out for sharp poking objects.  A bag of chips ARE NOT a cushion for 6 cans of soup!!!

Seriously folks, if you cannot bag groceries how can you expect to move up in the grocery business?  Let alone the world?  How would you like it if I came over to your house and sat on your cereal, stomped on your greens, practiced juggling with your pears, used your bananas for a hand cushion and threw tomato cans at your mushrooms?  Seriously.  I will do it and you dont have to pay me a cent.

Let me reiterate for the last time, if you cant bag groceries, dont even try.  I prefer to do it myself because I am a control freak and if I am paying $75 for basic necessities I want them to actually be EDIBLE when I get home.  I would also appreciate it if you did not act like your soul has been crushed when I say I would like to bag my own groceries.  No offense, I dont trust my juicy perishables with just anyone.

I have also noticed that every basket of strawberries I buy from your store appear to have been processed by paint shakers.  Please stop this.

Sincerely,
Users/CarrieBishop

20090628 20:45:28 nbsp this person left the EXACT same comment on the Safeway page. Somehow I think he/she is just a person who is never happy with bagging anywhere. Just do it yourself then. Love your deli in South Davis, heading there now. Users/patrick82

20090629 13:11:44 nbsp Actually that is untrue, in many areas of Sacramento both Nugget and Safeway give excellent service in regards to bagging.  Thanks for your attempt at helpful advice. Users/CarrieBishop

20090629 14:01:54 nbsp it wasnt meant to be helpful advice. It was pointing out your cut and paste method. Users/patrick82

20090726 09:10:46 nbsp Darn good house coffee beans.  Very smooth (even when prepared strongly in a french press) and has a nice nutty character  like almonds.  Bonus for being organic and being very competitive with other brands when on sale.  I was also happy to find Indian food in a pouch which requires no further cooking.  Perfect for camping and certainly saved me a trip to Trader Joes.  Im a lazy camper; dishes are the last thing I want to do after a full days survey work in streams :)  Amazing selection of bulk granola and alcohol tequila! Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090904 13:46:38 nbsp Nugget is one of the most beautiful markets Ive been to.  A little pricey? It can be, but it really depends on what you choose to buy and how you shop. There are definitely more expensive gourmet choice available, but there are also cheaper choices as well as the STOP discounts. With a little bit of discretion, you can shop just as economically here, and with a greater grocery shopping experience!  Couple bits of advice:

1) Make sure you are VERY FULL before you come here.  Otherwise, you will be mesmerized and will be tempted to buy the whole store.  I personally went after deliberately eating two large sandwiches and I STILL made several impulse buys..

2) the produce section is cunningly organized so that the expensive, albeit gorgoeous, organic produce is in the front, greeting you as you enter. The regular, (normal priced) produce is beyond, so keep that in mind! Users/Vegaofthelyre

20091022 01:21:38 nbsp I have never walked into such an eyepleasing market in my life until I walked this store. Every time I pass through Davis I stop here to pick up some flowers and fresh cookies :) Users/allwalksoflife87

20091207 15:23:37 nbsp Probably the best thing about this place, for me, is that the employees are young and happy. I feel awful when I go to Safeway and the employees look like miserable slaves.

Not to mention that the food is topquality. If you are into hardtofind European foods, this is the place for you. Fage yogurt  super yum. Clotted cream  nom. Ghee? Got it. Miso paste? Check. Well stocked with organics and freerange foods. Users/dizzyditz

20091229 16:17:14 nbsp I hadnt really come here before this year, but I enjoy the big selection of bread they offer, although you should come in before 2 so that you can get it fresh. Also, its one of 3 places in Davis that has almond croissants, and they are yummy. The MU and Konditorei have them too, but their hours arent as expansive as Nugget. Users/BrookeB
