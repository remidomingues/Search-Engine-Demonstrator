Jon Li is campaigning for a seat on the Davis Davis City Council City Council in 2010.

Davis needs to move in some new directions. I have some ideas.

 Platform 
  elect Joe Krovoza to the council; I am interested in the second seat.
  improve communication within local government, by implementing “policy governance,” which the Davis Food Coop board has been using for over a decade; 			policy governance emphasizes the council staying on top of the big picture rather than the micromanagement this council rails on about.
  to deal with the current institutional and financial crisis, implement the Viable System Model analysis for the design of a new city governance structure, exploring ideas not limited to a city charter, district elections, a popularly elected mayor, and term limits.
  I will not raise or spend any campaign contributions.
  If elected, I will not run for reelection.
