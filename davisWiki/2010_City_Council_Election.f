The California Statewide Direct Primary Election (including the 2010 City Council Election) was held on 20100608. Two seats, currently held by Mayor Ruth Asmundson, and Lamar Heystek, were open in this election, since both incumbents decided against running for reelection. Ruth Asmundson announced her retirement after two terms on the Davis City Council and two terms on the School Board. Lamar Heystek announced that he would not run for reelection so that he can focus on starting a family. The ballot also contained local measures, county offices, state offices and state initiatives.

Students who live in campusproper (e.g. not Cuarto/Castilian Hall area) are not eligible to vote in city elections as UC Davis is not technically a part of the City of Davis.

For more insight into the candidates views, you can visit the Davis College Democrats page and view all of their responses (regardless of party) to the 2010 City Council Candidates Questionnaire.

  June 2010 Election/Measure R Measure R  Renewal of the former March 2000 Election/Measure J Measure J  Passed

See the pages for each measure for details on the vote.

 County Supervisor, District 2 

 Note that is noticeably less than the total number of people voting from District 2 (the http://www.davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id3491:vanguardanalysissaylorskatesinunopposedbutwithrelativelylowpercentageofsupport&catid57:citycouncil&Itemid80 Vanguard estimates 3442 out of 5343, or 64%).  Bob Dunning said (as a joke, presumably) that people should write him in; he reported in his column in The Davis Enterprise that a number of people say they did just that.  However, unofficial writeins  and people who simply fail to vote in a given race at all  are not counted.  Thus, 100%.

Don Saylor ran unopposed.

20100320 21:13:36 nbsp So it is now official (deadlines have passed) Davis voters: we have our five candidates for CC in 2010.

As the former cochairman of the No on P campaign (a campaign that won 75% of the vote against a wellfinanced outoftown development company, Parlin, which outspent us over $100 to $1 and hired local political operatives like Bill Ritter and Maynard Skinner), I encourage all Davis residents who consider yourselves truly slowgrowth to ask the following questions of these five candidates, whether it be in person, via their websites, or in public forums, like the April 6th Chamber of Commerce debate:

 1. Are your receiving any political contributions from developers, either local (i.e John Whitcombe) or outoftown?

 1. If so, will you disclose these contributions if you are elected to the Council and the next Measure J (soon to be Measure R) proposed development comes before the Council for a vote (i.e. Covell Village IISenior City Housing Project)?

 1. What are your views, in general for Davis growth: should it be on peripheral, existing open agland spaces, or should we truly try to develop more true infill sites, closer to downtown and UC Davis jobs/retail?

I, for one, will be encouraging all No on P supporters to BULLET VOTE (i.e. mark only one vote on the list of CC candidates for Joe Krovoza, a candidate who has not accepted any monies from developers) for KROVOZA; this may ensure he will become Mayor ProTemp, and become Mayor when Don Saylor leaves us for Woodland (cant wait for that time!)

I welcome your comments, and please remember to vote in this election.

Greg  Since you wrote this comment over two months ago, do you still feel the same way?  Im wondering what youre thinking about Joe Ks very http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id3448:vanguardinterviewcitycouncilcandidatejoekrovoza&catid50:elections&Itemid83 frank and forthright admission (which I really admire, the guy is a class act) that he voted for Measure X and would probably support future development at Covell/Pole Line?  Also, how about the fact that Rochelle Swanson is the only candidate who voted against Measure X?  Or that EVERY candidate supports Measure R (the Measure J renewal)?

Personally, I just dont think that peripheral development is an issue in this race.  Im more interested in fiscal responsibility and the ability of our new council members to create a more civil environment.  Bullet voting, especially for the reasons you mentioned, doesnt seem very effective to me.   Users/KemblePope


20100524 17:47:14 nbsp Does anyone know of any scientific polling done on our local measures?  I anticipate that they both pass, but am curious as to the sentiment among the polled electorate.   Users/RocksandDirt

20100528 16:47:16 nbsp Kemble: Two months since my original post, I have thought more about the CC election, and have decided to vote for Krovoza and Swanson; I think they are the best choices we have in this election for Davis future and clearly either one is a step above Syndey Vergis, who in my opinion, is nothing more than a younger version of Ruth Asmundson, highly connected to the local political establishment, funded by developers and firefighters money.

I have met with Joe Krovoza, and he candidly did tell us about his support for Covell Village back in 2006, but also reported that now, as a CC member, he would look at any peripheral development with a much different perspective, and reiterated his support for more centralized planning near the core downtown area.

I strongly disagree with your statement that peripheral development is not at issue in this election; for many Davis voters, peripheral development will ALWAYS be an issue in local elections, as long as there are open land spaces and greedy developers around!!!!

Cheers,
