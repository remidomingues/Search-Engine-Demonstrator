20110104 16:36:45 nbsp Ive been to APEX thrice, once just to look (oh, theres a bike shop here! neat!), once to buy a lock, and this time to get a tuneup. I dont know ANYTHING about bikes, I walk into a store and buy the one that looks pretty and is in my price range. Because of this I have felt like a complete dumbass at some shops (uhhh... yeah... you know... that thingie, that goes into the other thingie... and um, how do I put this on the bike?) and like I was invisible at some, (B&L, Im lookin atchu and your crappy customer service) while all of my experiences at APEX have been 100% comfortable. Ive dealt with the owner and with the others and they all have the same friendly, nonjudgmental of us more ignorant types, open demeanor which I think is a testament to what is probably really great employee training, or maybe awesome owners just attract awesome employees. And I took in my bike to get tuned up at like, 11, 12 oclock today? I get a call at 2:30ish saying its ready. Whuuuuuut. I was unprepared for such quick service. Badass as always. Users/rrenati

20110426 16:39:46 nbsp I took my old, beat up, craigslist purchase here for a full tune up. After looking at the bike, Aaron said that his $90 option would be the best choice for my situation, so I agreed since I dont know a whole lot about bikes. I returned for my bike when he called, and it seemed to be in good shape. After riding it around for a day or two, I noticed a few things that I wasnt 100% satisfied with, my brakes werent adjusted as well as they could have been. My gears shifted OK, but they didnt seem perfect. I would of graded the repair as OK, not good, but not bad either. Then, 9 days after this tune up, a weld on my frame broke. Im not sure if this is one of those things that can be seen prior to it happening, but I decided to take it to another bike shop. At this bike shop, the workers there were talking to me as if I hadnt serviced my bike in years. When I told them I had it tuned up a couple weeks prior, they laughed and said hopefully it wasnt a bike shop in town that had done this. Apparently, there were some very simple things that Aaron didnt care of, such as greasing various parts on the bike. This ticked me off, I dont think Ill return to the shop again. Later that same day, my roommate took his bike back into APEX to get a rear wheel put on that Aaron suggested after a tuneup. Aaron told him to return in ~20 minutes, so he did and Aaron told him he put a different wheel on, not the one he ordered and this one would cost $40. So, my roommate agreed, and it turns out, Aaron put on the different wheel, along with a different tire, and the wheel he put on had a different gear set. My roommate was pretty angry that Aaron didnt tell him about all the differences between the two wheels. Were still not sure why he put on a different tire, apparently, he said it was easier. Im pretty unhappy with both our experiences here, and I feel like he took advantage of both of us. Certainly will not return. Users/rcrane

  In response to this comment, APEX does not offer a $90 tuneup.  Student pricing is $40, $70, or $110 and I only reserve the later for race bikes.  I have to say that I stand by my work.  If you werent happy at the time of delivery or within 30 days after, you are were always able to bring it by to get checked free of charge.  As for your weld breaking 9 days later, that is something that can happen at anytime with no real preemptive notification.  Overall condition and structural integrity is always a concern when buying a used bike, especially from craigslist.  Im sorry that I didnt foresee your frame crack or prevent you from making the purchase in the first place.  As for greasing parts, I only use grease on bearings, pressed cups, or areas of sustained metal to metal contact.  Everywhere else, ie. chain, cable and housing, joints, pivots and such, get doused with a thin teflon based penetrating lube.  It will not appear to be greased but it is well lubed.  As for your friend, I ordered him a wheel based of the description of his bike over the phone and budget.  After seeing his bike in person, I realized that he needed A different wheel.  When he came to get the wheel, it had not come in yet, but he had to get to class, so I offered to LOAN him a nice ($129 new) used wheel I had until his came in so he could get to class (what other shop does that... hmm?).  He asked if he could just buy it.  I went ahead and sold it to him for $40 with a BETTER tire than he had on his other wheel and spaced it for a 7spd cassette (also included) vs his 7spd freewheel.  I never took advantage of you guys, on the contrary, I went out of my way to help.  Users/Aaron.Curtin

  OK, then maybe you should consider greasing other parts or just do a better job in general, because for a price of $50, another bike shop in town welded my frame and adjusted/greased my bike where you did not, and my bike has ridden much better after this $50 repair than your $70 +$20 in parts  $90 tune up. as far as greasing goes, its funny you say that you grease the bearings when the guys from the other shop looked at my bike, they said that the bearings especially lacked grease. so, as far as i am concerned, you did a poor job on my tune up considering my price. second of all, you did not offer to LOAN him anything. you told him the wheel came in, told us to come back in twenty minutes, so we did. you put on a different wheel, WITHOUT asking him, and he did not offer to buy it, you told him he could buy it, and you did not explain to him the differences between the two wheels OR inform him that you swaped out the tire as well, you simply told him that this other wheel would be sufficient and somebody else had used it for a while, but not for an extended period of time.

    Well, at this point, it is their word against mine.  I know what work I did and did not do.  And as for your friend, yes I did offer to loan him the wheel until the suitable one came in.  Ive done it before and I will do it again.  Hell, Ive lent out compete bikes free of charge.  Its one of my way of trying to make the situation better.  I apologize that your experience was not up to your expectations, but perhaps you should have considered vocalizing your concerns directly rather than running to another shop.  I could have fixed your bike free of charge, and made arrangements to fix the weld if thats what you wanted.  In the end, with a little better communication on your part, you could have saved on spending an additional $50. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20110508 18:11:11 nbsp Just wanna say, I LOVE THIS PLACE. Ive only been here once, but the demeanor of the owner and the concern he took for me and my bike was awesome. Most places are trying to sell me a new bike, but here he comes telling me how to get integrated shifters onto my old Trek 1220 and offering me what I think is a REALLY reasonable price. Definitely coming back here in the future for all my bicycle needs. Users/JonathanHong

20110620 17:18:15 nbsp At first, the owner of APEX impressed me with his friendliness. I asked for a custom build, and he gave me more options than I could choose from. Upon placing my order, I was satisfied. However, my experience went downhill from there.

First, the open hours are pretty inconvenient so going early in the morning or later in the evenings were not an option. Upon receiving my order, there were multiple problems and the build was not to my specifications; and the quality of several parts were seriously lacking. The guy who was there could fix one issue, but I didnt have any more time to sit around for them to redo the build. Finally, the price that I was quoted was seriously lowballed; about 50% less than what they handed me the invoice for. The employee there at the time basically gave me the I cant do anything about it attitude.

I wholeheartedly support small businesses like this, but Im sorry to say I will not be going here again because of their poor service.  Users/BreadBaron

  I apologize for your experience, and hope that you will reconsider visiting us again.  I am sure that in the time you had picked up your bike to the last point of contact that I made every attempt to resolve any issues. In the past, I have done everything from swapping parts, rebuilding wheels over and over again, to the point of stripping down a bike, bead blasting and powder coating out of pocket because the frame color wanted was no longer available to try and keep customers happy.  I will make it a point to try and live up to everyones expectations and to ensure that the bike you wanted is the bike you get.  I have learned recently that it is becoming harder and harder to work within some budgets, and that there comes a point when I just have to say no.  Usually low prices started as an optimistic quote, but has since been eliminated from the processes, as too many times the price has skyrocketed to the point of the build becoming a financial loss on my end.

20110803 16:13:07 nbsp This place seems really hit or miss. I went in because I had a Groupon for a bike tuneup and I needed a part on the back of my bike replaced. It took them a while to get the parts in which is understandable, but they could have done a better job communicating with me. They would tell me to come pick it on a certain day, so I would leave work early to come in before they closed at 6, and then Id get there and they would tell me it wasnt ready yet and they forgot to call me. Annoying, but understandable. When I went to pick it up I was told they replaced the chain which would cost me $10, even though I just had a new chain put on a few weeks earlier. When I told the guy working that I didnt need a new chain, he offered to replace it with one of the old ones from behind the counter. After I told him mine was pretty new and Id like it back he remembered where he put it and put it back on my bike. Annoying, but understandable. I spend the next day thinking I was really out of shape from not riding my bike in a week before I realized the brake was rubbing against the back tire the whole time. I had to bring it back and have it fixed again which was done pretty quickly at no cost, and the guy even offered to stay late in case I didnt make it before closing. I guess he didnt tighten something enough when putting on the new tire. Annoying, but understandable. On my way out I accidentally left my bike lock in the shop and did not realize this until I got home. I tried to call the shop but no one answered (understandable since it was after closing), but the phone never went to voicemail. I sent an email saying I would stop by in the morning, a Saturday morning, and pick it up. I showed up at 12 on Saturday, since that is when they are supposed to open, waited for 15 minutes and had to leave. Someone else was waiting outside also. When I came back later around closing time, the store was still not open and there was a note on the door from the other guy waiting that said I waited for you until 1pm, where were you? I guess the shop just didnt open up at all on Saturday even though the hours are posted on the door as 125. This part I dont understand. Its not the worst place ever, but there are definitely better places to take your bike for tuneups in Davis.  Users/jlbernst

20110808 23:14:46 nbsp In response to all the recent questions and concerns about the shop.  I have to say that this is still one of the best little bike shops around according to other wiki users.  We are going through some tough times right now as it is a family business and I have been dealing with my mothers Alzheimers and have had to close the shop periodically to deal with that.  I have been working late into the night to try and make up for not being open during the day.  I wont be around again tomorrow since I have to follow up with doctors and find an assisted living facility for my mother.  If you need to get something done with your bike, Im still one of the best local resources and will come to you if necessary.  I hope that all my loyal customers understand and that I will try to have the shop up and running regular hours by the middle of the week.  Feel free to call or email with any questions.

20110903 21:58:53 nbsp What do you do if you have a flat and no way to get your bike to a shop for repair? Call Aaron! Just having moved to the area with a bike that had a flat and a car in which the bike wouldnt fit, I called Aaron and HE DROVE TO MY APARTMENT THE SAME DAY to fix the tire. He took the tire off, fixed it at his shop and drove back the same day to put it back on my bike. A bike shop that does house calls is awesome! Aaron was friendly and professional and gave great recommendations about the local restaurant and bar scene.  Im so happy with the service he provided and will definitely be visiting in the future for any of my biking needs! Thanks Aaron.  Users/RobinCepparo

  That doesnt surprise me!  He seems very willing to go above and beyond. Users/FiCubbage

20111002 21:43:35 nbsp Okay, its about time I weighed in.  Ive Used Apex as my primary bike shop since Aaron has opened the place, and seen him move through several different locations.  Aaron and Princess have always been helpful, flexible and friendly.  I have also experienced parts delivery when Ive encountered flats or other mechanical failures at work.

About 10 months ago, I broke the frame of my 20 yearold Trek hybrid.  My fault entirely, as I was hauling bags of dog food and buckets of kitty litter (at the same time, along with some other stuff!) on a weeny little Mountain Rack.  Anyway, since the crack was in a location not conducive to welding, Aaron guided me toward a cargo bike, which Id been considering for some time anyways.  Now, Im not talking about the conversion kit, but the real deal: a Kona Ute.  The price he gave me was beyond fair; it was excellent.

Unfortunately it took some time for the bike to come in.  Although this was on Konas end, not Aarons, he realized that I was getting frustrated (biking with a broken frame feels like your bike is mounted on a poorly inflated yoga ball), so he located the model I wanted, and drove to pick it up from the dealer who had it in stock  in Oakland!.

Now that I have the bike, I love it (except for the kickstand, but, once again, that isnt Aarons fault).  I never have to drive while I am in town, or even trips to Winters and such.  I have put somewhere between 6000 and 7000 miles on it, so I am in for repairs and adjustments fairly regularly.  Aaron and his crew are always professional, friendly and do great work.  When I need a new part but cant afford it just then, they understand and dont pressure me.  Rather they do the adjustment to buy me some time.  Sometimes it can take a while, because the shop has a very loyal clientele, and is quite busy, so there are often interruptions.  That is the nature of a small familyowned business  Aaron cant very well ignore all his other customers while I am there.  The other reason is that sometimes the parts come in slowly.  Again, that happens with smaller businesses.  Big shops will often get better service from distributors in any industry.

I will keep supporting Apex as a fine example of a wellrun local business.  Thanks Aaron.

20111019 09:46:26 nbsp I called the other night, 10 minutes before 6:00, and explained I had a flat tire.  Aaron had me bring my bike in right away (he stayed late!), and he noticed it may not have been a flat at all...the valve was crooked, so it was impossible to pump air into the tire.  He straightened the valve, pumped up the tire, and didnt charge me.  It may be fixed, or I may still have a flat, but he recommended trying that first, before spending the money on a new tube.

Another bike shop (yep, here in Davis) quoted me a much higher price, didnt attempt to straighten the valve, and recommended I replace the whole tire and tube.  The Bike Barn wouldnt even touch it.  Aaron saved me a bunch of money, and fixed the problem in minutes.  Thats good customer service in my book.  Ill keep coming back for sure! Users/FiCubbage

20120109 17:11:54 nbsp I think of myself as a pretty handy guy, who does a little maintenance on my bike now and then (e.g. brake adjustments, tire replacements, and the occasional derailleur work).  But when I bought a 1969 English utility bike with an old 3speed Sturmy Archer hub, i felt a little out of my league.  I tried tuning it myself, but always came up with problems here and there.  So i took it to a local bike shop and they said that i needed to work give it an good tuneup that would set me back about $60 and take about two days to complete.  However, when i took it to APEX, Dan took one look at it and addressed the problems right there and then!  The best part about it, he didnt charge me for any of that work!  Instead, they installed a bike stand for me for cheap, and sent me on my way.  Great shop.  Support your local business! Users/SteveWong

20120423 21:31:00 nbsp My daughter inherited a used bike from a family friend. It was a bit worse for wear, having spent the last couple of years outside. I dropped it off for the red service at 1PM, and Aaron called me to say it was ready at 5PM the same day. In addition to the regular service, he installed 2 new tubes and only charged for the parts (no extra labor charge). Everything is working smoothly now, and my daughter really likes her new bike!  Users/RobWestergaard

20120806 12:18:23 nbsp First time at APEX. The student price for the $40 tune up is a good deal in Davis. I felt like I paid a fair price for all the labor/parts that went into getting the tuneup plus replacing my old shimano brake/shifter combo and rear brake pads. The workmanship looks and feels good  the owner also addressed some other issues with the bike that were nice extras. If the store doesnt have the part you need, expect to wait a little longer. Owner is very friendly and informative. I would go back. Users/CatherineFong

20120809 12:29:56 nbsp I recently had my bike tuned up at Apex... and since the tuneup (in the span of 1 week), Ive had 2 flat tires. After getting the first flat, I brought my bike to Kens Bike & Ski to get fixed because Apex was not open. A couple days later, my tire went flat again. Luckily, Apex was open, so I brought it there. I thought something fishy was going on because I have never gotten a flat in the 2.5 years I have owned this bike, and ever since my tuneup, getting 2 flat tires within a week was frustrating. After bringing my bike back to Apex, they told me the wheel was not properly sealed and that was why it kept going flat. He gave me a new seal for the wheel to fix the problem. Despite the fact that it was not resealed properly in the first place (most likely when I got it tuned up at Apex), he still charged me for the fix. I was slightly upset because the root to the problem resulted in a careless tuneup... Bummer.   Users/MarthaTritt

  As most people will agree, flat tires are something that can never be 100% guaranteed against.  Yes, you did get a tune up and yes, you did get a flat shortly after.  Im sorry, but stuff happens.  Im not sure what caused your original flat because you had another shop fix it.  When you came back for your 2nd flat (1st one that I saw), I had noticed a slit in the tube on the underside, closest to the rim.  This is usually indicative of improper installation of the tube or a creeping rim strip (you referred to as a seal above).  I didnt want to accuse anyone of wrongdoing so I installed a better rim strip and new tube.  Since you had had a tuneup earlier in the month, I did not charge you labor as a good faith gesture, but I did charge you for the parts.  If you have any other concerns, feel free to stop by and vent to me directly, but remember that getting a flat, no matter how well prepared, sometimes just cant be avoided.  Users/Aaron.Curtin

20121016 14:41:17 nbsp I recently took my bike in for a tune up at Aaron shop. Upon getting there he wasnt at the shop at the moment, however, he did show up a few minutes after I had called him letting him know that I wanted to drop of my bike. While he was taking my bike in we chatted for a few minutes and he seemed like a really friendly guy who knew what he was talking about. Unfortunately this was the last pleasant experience I had at the APEX bike shop.
At the original drop off time I had asked him when I would be able to pick it up. He made jokes saying “next year” because he was clearly busy. I wasn’t in any rush so I told him to hold it as long as he needed it. He quotes me for Thursday for a pick up. Thursday comes around and I hadn’t heard anything from the shop so I decide to wait another day. In the early afternoon on Friday I come down to the shop to find that not only is the bike not finished, but it hasn’t been started. In fact, says Aarons assistant because Aaron isn’t there, it’s still a fair ways down the list. Not worrying about it I tell him that it’s alright and I head home. He pulls it up after I leave and they get it done that evening.  The next day I go to pick up the bike and surprise surprise Aaron is once again not there. Only after another four customer’s line up outside his door does he show up. Still not a big deal, I was just happy to get my bike back, until I saw it.
Upon receiving the final product, other than some new tires, I can’t actually tell what was done to it. There were still cobwebs and dust covering it like I had just pulled it out of the garage. Now I wasn’t expecting a full wash or anything like that, but just a basic wipe down of the frame would have been nice.  Then he comes up to me and gives me a bill for over $100 when I had asked for a basic tune up and some new tires. I begrudgingly pay the man just happy that I can get out of there.  I get the bike home and decide to ride it around my apartment complex just to make sure it’s working properly and about halfway around the chain falls off of the gears. Not what I expected after just paying a fat bill to get this bike fixed. I call up Aaron and let him know the problem. Fifteen minutes later the bike is down there and Aaron fixes it up and claims that the chain will no longer fall off. To this day it still has a few issues.
After I get home I decide to email him for a breakdown of what I paid for because I never actually got a receipt. I give him a full week and he never responds. The next week I call him up and tell him that I wanted a receipt and a breakdown and he says he’d email me back by the end of the week. Never responds. Apparently from the rest of the comments here I’m the minority, and maybe this was just a series of oversights. I can say though that even though Aaron is a nice guy I won’t be taking my bike back to his shop.
