20110108 10:58:38 nbsp No problem. Ive actually encountered the University TM/copyright types when trying unsuccessfully to modify the Gunrock logo for a FD patch. I would utterly shocked if they would lend the name to ANYTHING the University didnt control or at least profit from.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20110109 22:40:15 nbsp A heading may be needed if the Mathematics page becomes about more than the UCD department, as Communication did.  Theres probably other subject pages that assume theyre for UCD departments.  Thanks, Professor!  Users/BruceHansen

20110109 22:56:31 nbsp I thought that People was more than a partial list of people.  Regarding Users, I thought they were something more specific than people that would merit their own page.  I dont know if users should be completely and exclusively described on the People page.  There is now only a partial description of them. Users/BruceHansen

20110115 10:14:30 nbsp Haha I just went through and carefully excised some of the worst offenders on that page, and when I hit save there was the dreaded edit conflict. I like your version a lot better though, it doesnt screw around with any of that nonsense. Users/JoePomidor

20110124 23:06:40 nbsp I appreciate you cleaning up the locksmith page I created yesterday. I finally learned how to create a page on daviswiki and comment after all these years. I enjoy your restaurant reviews. Keep it up! Users/kobe24

20110125 19:43:38 nbsp Thanks for the welcome... I have been lurking a while so Id seen all those pages, but was pleased to discover your restaurant reviews. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110126 21:35:59 nbsp I probably couldnt tell you... Ive only been a few times and I usually order the same thing. My partner got some sort of fake beef (I think) once, and that wasnt fried. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110129 17:21:42 nbsp Hey Covert Professor! Thanks for your message. Id love to scan the document for you and everyone else (and already wouldve), but it is not in my possession. Being a lowly intern, I do not have access to such legal documents, but have alerted those who do. Expect a scan hopefully in the next couple days! Feel free to message me if you have any other questions or concerns!  Users/LeoThom

20110129 17:35:59 nbsp Hey CovertProfessor! Yeah, I definitely agree with you. Hopefully, CampusCreds use of Davis Wiki will be less heated in the future. Thank you for your help! Users/LeoThom

20110131 14:40:40 nbsp It is misleading because of how they use the logo. Theyre using it in a way that implies that the project is somehow affiliated with ASUCD when the only affiliation is them paying money to ASUCD. If not affiliation, it at least implies endorsement, which hasnt happened either.

Let me put it this way: What does a student groupon clone in Davis have to do with ASUCD? If the answer is nothing, why do they need the logo? Should restaurants start posting ASUCD logos? Landlords? It really makes no sense. If they wanted to have a page of local things they sponsored and they paid to display the ASUCD logo, that would be an entirely different animal. Users/WilliamLewis

20110131 15:28:41 nbsp re: CampusCred: That seems about right. At least with the impression Ive gotten from whats been said. Users/JabberWokky

Thanks, guys.  Im not really gone (obviously) just here less.  cp


Its a selfidentified rumor.  Thats descriptive enough for a reader to make their own judgement regarding the veracity of the presented events.  Its actually pretty well written, distinguishing between what is claimed and what is supposed by the author of the text.  It does  and this is the crucial point  explain a great deal as to why the entry exists.  I believe the person who posted it immediately deleted it with the intent that it be a secret message to Daubert to answer his reasonable question as to what the vague implications were.  Without the missing puzzle piece of that reply, there is no reasonable way to comprehend the reason the entry was written.   Another good reason to bring the rumor into the light is that it is relatively testable: it could be confirmed or denied by people actually connected to the events.  Again, the source of that confirmation or denial would be important aspect, but I think if somebody is willing to stand by a statement, it is then fair to place the burden of judging that source on the reader.  Im not advocating putting an anonymous rumor under a spotlight, but rather dragging it to where it can be found by people trying to research and comprehend the matter.  By doing so, it may well help interested members of the community explore the issue and possibly find some actual verifiable facts or personal testimony regarding what happened.  Its basically like most entries founded on rumors.  Some are rightfully dismissed by a chorus of people in the know, some fade away, and some are confirmed by multiple people in the community. Users/JabberWokky

In short:  I agree an anonymous rumor of this nature shouldnt be used in the actual entry, but I think the context it gives is needed to understand the subject enough to make reasonable judgement calls regarding what is presented.  If Talk pages werent deleted after awhile, I might have edited differently.  jw

20110313 14:23:58 nbsp Thanks for your help on the Bar Taboos page. Its a lot of info, and somewhat boring, I know. I just found it odd that a) no page ever existed about it before, and b) that it is now necessary as many have seemingly acted as if these rules dont apply to them.  Sad really. Users/WesP

20110314 14:11:48 nbsp Im almost always inspired by your edits! I appreciate your attempts to be objective and true. You should come to the next wikigathering in one of those Guy Fawkes masks; wed all love to meet you! ;) Users/ScottMeehleib

20110314 14:21:08 nbsp So many times I feel frustrated with the UC Davis system and some of the terrible professors and higherups that I have encountered there, but you are a rare person who keeps me going. just knowing that you are a UC professor and that you actually care about the community and being true to yourself is so meaningful to a student like me.

20110331 16:22:30 nbsp Two things that State College had that were very cool were multilane limited access bike highways (through undeveloped campus property and game land) and their composting pickup and delivery spots.  Parks have a little three sided fenced in area where people can drop off any green waste and pick up rich, city turned compost made up of what was dropped off before.  Its right by the parking area so its easy to back up to and use.  http://www.statecollegepa.us/index.aspx?NID659 Link Users/JabberWokky

20110406 15:27:16 nbsp By the way, my fuzzy vision of you has now resolved.  I now picture you as wiki:wikipedia:Stephen Fry.  Or at least I read your writings in his voice.  No offense whatsoever should you happen to be, say, a small Sri Lankan woman rather than a tall, large British man.  Neither would surprise me in reality, although if you actually are Stephen Fry himself, I believe it would startle me a great deal. I think my invented mental voice for you has more to do with how you string your words together than anything else. Users/JabberWokky

20110406 15:58:33 nbsp I was thinking something more like his work http://www.youtube.com/watch?vVnnmnRmdM0Y here.  In which he shows less of his comedy (although quite a bit of charm) and more of the incredible aplomb http://www.youtube.com/watch?vYYEcfLTb2fU shown here.  Stephen Fry in America is a good series, although Sarah and I have yet to watch the whole thing.  Users/JabberWokky

20110407 17:52:11 nbsp  I dont mean to be over dramatic or stereotypical. But what you did meant a lot to me. Not many people in Davis have ever stuck up for me. Thank you. Users/Dozer

20110407 20:37:40 nbsp One possible source for a great simple steak is surprising: the Sacramento 49er Truck Stop.  Theyve since been sold so I dont know if it is the case anymore, but they used to get steak right from a local farm, and if the right cook was there, they had the equipment to cook it right.  Great meat, seared and served.  Not fancy or the most reliable (we used to ask the waitresses if the right cook was on and if we should order one), but quite good.  Of course, part of the appeal is that we used to go there for hours to read or work.  If they have gone downhill since they were sold to a chain (Pilot), I almost dont want to hear about it because I rather like the memories. Users/JabberWokky

20110407 22:48:27 nbsp  Thank you, I am trying to do all I can to gather proof. I am going to go through my email to see if I have any conversations saved and if it will help I will try to get my phone records to show how many times I had called the suicide hotline during that time. I am not willing to post them publicly, but I would be willing to privately email them to a site worker to prove my point. I will not post them publicly due to fear of more harassment via phone. I am trying to be as compliant and helpful as possible. I am sad I offended some people though, but this isnt personal, I am trying to help others.

Thanks again. Users/Dozer

20110408 21:48:06 nbsp Was gonna revert Thomas page, but always feel weird reverting negative comments.  Glad you took control! Users/Davidlm

20110409 09:25:28 nbsp The most valuable part of the comment (that I could understand, anyway) is the fact that people are offering discounts for comments.  Its one of several shops I know of, and I cant figure out a good way to let people know that thats happening... Users/Davidlm

20110420 15:16:07 nbsp I heard about that Sutter lawsuit on NPR last week (I think).  Freaking crazy.  One of the many, many, many examples of just how effed up the medical system is in this country.  Contracts that dont let the payer question whether the services theyre paying for were ever actually performed... which, as stupid as it sounds, is outright necessary because those payers are so unbelievably delighted to screw over the patients by declining to pay for services to save a buck.  Then on the flip side, youve got audits of Medicaid providers that somewhat routinely (OK, small exaggeration) result in the filing of fraud charges thatll be dropped just before trial, just to (my personal theory) try and scare medical providers straight. Users/TomGarberson

20110420 17:08:01 nbsp Whups... yeah, that was what I meant.  Thanks. Users/JabberWokky

20110421 23:48:34 nbsp Sweet thanks man for doing that, I appreciate it
, I just learned today how to make my name in blue if I am editing (on the Picnic Day 2011, I think I may have messed up the Skype{?} )

But its a pain in the {{{@__}}} to use DavisWiki on the iPhone to edit.
I have been reading some random entries on the Wiki and Im going to share some knowlege on them.  Users/NikhilDahal

20110422 10:06:49 nbsp Thanks on that revert. I was gonna do that, but I wanted to go back thru the talk page and check What the community ha agreed to do. Also, Im on my phone at the moment so things go verrrrry slooooowwly. Users/JoePomidor

20110422 10:53:34 nbsp what whitewash. 30 days this has had no clarification. we are getting bids for cameras,  no solid data to warrant the implication as fact. I wrote comment in good faith. why are you pressing what has no basis in fact. do you have a personal grudge of somekind? the writer has not even called or written to us, no other observation as to place or time. if its a case of personal preference on your part that Village Cab continues to have this mar, thats fine. But thats not necessarily grounds for
replacing the comment. I made the comment to lower the pitch of the accusation, and now appropriate time has elapsed for someone to respond. No one has. This has been far from a whitewash. A whitewash would have made the whole thing disappear in its entirety. I dont think you realize how much this accusation has already hurt our Drivers work load. But i suppose you dont really care about that Covert. You seem to have made up your mind without facts that i have seen, that we deserve this mar. Maybe you have more facts involving the truth?  Users/DavidPlacencia

20110422 11:24:55 nbsp It looks like another visit to the talk page is needed.  In the interest of keeping the conversation in one place, rather than on multiple user pages, I went ahead and recreated Village Cab/Talk. Users/TomGarberson

20110422 13:58:53 nbsp comments appreciated. but i didnt know there had to be consensus regarding that edit. you acted alone, did you get consensus? and noone spent their time altruistically to help anyone, you have thousands of hours invested in your edits and Wiki. I have 60,000 hours invested in my business. I like many many aspects of the Wiki CP, but i do feel a grudge not against me personally, but I feel there is a bit of supercilious positioning involved when iy
seems apparent that the Wiki is more important to you than the negative effect of another editors comments are having on my company. Yes i admit i feel a bit defensive after being on pins and needles over this...i have much to lose here, and
i just lost my mom, she helped me start this business, and i guess its just not a great day. I did talk to other editors, just not in writing on the wiki and i gathered it might be alright after 30 days to end the unsubstantiated doubts. I know CP the page isnt
mine. but the name IS. i am not a child. i know whats mine. but you have never
inquired to us if new substance has appeared or not. my phone number is on the page. does it even matter to you that not 1 person has
offered illumination? Users/DavidPlacencia

20110422 14:10:02 nbsp i agree CP there should be some kind of consensus regarding removal, just how am i
supposed to bring it up? there are no protocols as to whom do i direct  this request for timely review? I am awkward at this, and
am just more than exasperated...my grudge comment was not meant as accusation, but you experienced editors seem to get mad when neophytes dont do things the proper way when their is no rule book for such situations. this is OUR WIKI, right? well we deserve some
rules here. This is OUR great resource for info. LETS not treat editorial newbies like we are getting on your more experienced nerves, eh?
maybe you coud have responded better to my edit: like  your edit requires consensus, reposting for now. Any questions, write me CP
 Users/DavidPlacencia

20110422 14:27:57 nbsp well, have to admit the circumstances for my heavy involvement of late, are steeped in negativity. but i am optimistic about peoples intentions though, and that many minds involved will make a clear and fair path...CP thank you very much for your condolences. ...will direct remaining comments to talk page Users/DavidPlacencia

20110422 22:41:27 nbsp Well said, and I agree on all points.  Users/MasonMurray

20110424 18:26:26 nbsp Everytime I edit a page, it messes up the Skype on that page, what should I do to the settings on my computer so that this does not happen in the future? Users/NikhilDahal

20110424 23:33:52 nbsp Im leaving this here so as to not confuse the line of discussion on the other entry.  How about this approach: Why should an unfounded accusation stay on the wiki?  Im not saying it should or shouldnt, but answering that might help clarify the issue.  Is it an issue of openness so that the accusation can gain a foundation of verifiable support?  An ideal of free speech?  A mirror to the sidewalk conversations that already occur with or without the wiki?  I am, of course, using Toms basis of unfounded accusation where even the person who said it cannot verify it. Users/JabberWokky

20110425 00:03:59 nbsp I think its a case of the facts as being presented not supporting the conclusion.  Or so Im reading it.  Im not sure.  As I said in the edit comment, Im not so much trying to debate it as examine the issue.  Whats that one case where an tenant was darkly hinting that the manager would physically harm him or her if her/his identity was revealed?  Also, near the same time there was Reneng, who started out as a tenant and then later claimed to never have been a tenant (among other shifts in their story).  Both left long rambling rants that were mostly deleted, or at least edited way down.  RealComputers left various bits that he probably honestly believed that were removed.  So its not unheard of.  Thus my turning it around: what is the essential aspect that makes comments worth preserving?  There is something, some criteria, as Ive fought to keep comments I didnt particularly like. Users/JabberWokky

20110425 00:15:54 nbsp Incidentally, I had a thought:


Im not sure, but I think unfounded is a way to find harmful comments.  Where good is a well reasoned, personal perspective, and bad is Im not sure this is the one, but I think they are the ones that rape girls at their parties.  Which is a comment that pops up about once a year on a random fraternity entry.  No personal knowledge, not even sure if they have the right fraternity they heard the rumor about or not, but it is still popped up online to sit there forever.  Or, in reality, they tend to be deleted pretty quickly.  Contrast with Sigma Chi who did have an unfortunate and persistent reputation as the date rape frat, which was noted on their entry (as a rumor!).  Id also argue that fluff should go  Ohh!  I love crepes, but I havent been yet! is pretty much useless.  Not harmful, but just as unfounded. Users/JabberWokky

20110427 18:45:06 nbsp I notice a conspicuous lack of Sudwerk on your restaurant reviews.  I recommend trying their burgers.  Especially a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese.  Add some jalapenos if you like spicy.  Without a doubt my favorite burger in town. Users/TomGarberson

20110531 23:21:32 nbsp You posted: If the ducks hated bread, they wouldnt eat it. Ducks love bread like humans love fatty, sugary foods. In both cases, the foods we love are bad for us.

Ducks eat bread due to instinct, not love.  Ducks hate bread because (a) they can choke on the bread and die, (b) the bread impacts their crops and then they die, or (c) they get sick from the bread and die from predation.  My point is, and I hope you agree, why give an animal a type of food that can kill them?  Since they are not your pets, what right do you have to harm them in the first place?

We have less than 8090 ducks (down from almost 700 in June 2009) that roost in the arboretum at night, so it will be a matter of time before all the ducks disappear and the debate over bread would be moot.  Users/jasoncw

 Of course, I dont really know what happened, either.  I just agree with Daubert that these things do happen, and that everything he did and said on the wiki came across as very sincere and honest.  I also sometimes wonder about the small town aspect of Davis; everyone does know everyone else, and I suspect that is even more true for those who are prominent in the religious community.  So, I thought your remark to him was a bit unfair (though I know you meant it kindly) when you said that he seems to see the world as excluding him.  Some people really do get shunned and excluded  its not just a matter of perception.  Then again, your advice to talk to someone about it was good, because if someone really is getting shunned and excluded thats a difficult thing to handle, and talking it out with a third party could be beneficial. cp
   Ah, if were talking about the same moment, that was when he started saying that he had gone to all the churches and that they had all shunned him.  Theres a difference between feeling like a group or some groups are excluding you and feeling like you cant fit in anywhere.  The one can lead to the other, but while the first is temporary, the latter can be serious.  Especially when you feel like you cant find safety and guidance (which is one reason to seek out a church community).  Thus my very careful suggestion he look elsewhere for somebody to speak to so he didnt feel like there was no direction left.  The actual events are pretty moot at that point: if every incident was abusive or if every incident was a misperception on his part, or any other factor  it doesnt make a difference.  The end result is that he feels like all avenues for help have been cut off.  I dont need to know the reality to see he was in pain... and at that point, talking like he had nowhere left to go.  Add to that the fact that it can be hard to have internally founded perspective when youre young, and I thought it worth saying.  jw

In order to keep a record, I made sure I did not delete the photo from the files page.) I would prefer not to have the photo in the text as it may give people the idea to go looking for that particular poster. On this note, Ive been trying to track down the poster for the past 2 years with no success. If you know where the poster is, would you please let me know so I can tell next years officers? (knjackson@ucdavis.edu) I have asked next years officers to make a new poster we can leave on the Quad. In the meantime, I suggest removing the photograph from the text OR making a section for photographs on our page. The extra section for photographs may be nice, as it will give a chance for others to post some of their favorite community memories. Please keep in mind, though, that our team has strict rules on public photographs, so some photographs may be deleted for these regulations. Thanks!

20110623 11:51:22 nbsp A community never formed around sac wiki. Its just random editors usually leaving one off reviews or promoting their interests.

  20110623 12:22:03 nbsp Yup.  Pretty much.  I was against the transplanting for similar reasons.  Interwiki is great for certain things, but only if theres an active community at both ends.

20110624 10:07:52 nbsp It just seemed to overwhelm the entry.  It read more like An argument for why the wiki is philosophically better than Patch than About Patch.  It probably wouldnt be so bad if there was more in there, but as it was written, it seemed to be the culminating point. Users/JabberWokky

20110624 13:09:12 nbsp I agree with your concerns about the issues inherent in the way Patch is being run.  I just think that using the wiki as a yardstick on the wiki is a bit questionable.  Comparing it to, say, the Enterprise or DCN  or the Davis Voice and Peoples Vanguard of Davis would be a more comfortable comparison for me.  Using the wiki as the sole metric places an assumption that people are aware of things to the level that those who are editing understand them.  For instance, the fact that nobody is paying for a wiki entry or that theres not some paid workers that build wiki entries  which has, time and time again, been shown to be a erroneous assumption. Users/JabberWokky

20110624 13:12:21 nbsp The thing that really got me about the Vanguard is when I used a couple of its articles to write up one sides argument on the noise ordinance issue surrounding that daycare.  I presented the viewpoint in the Vanguard article and agreed completely with it.  Because I didnt know about the facts that it didnt present.  I dont remember all the details now, but it didnt give any of the history about the steps that had already been taken, the results of studies, etc.  It expressed one side of the argument and provided the facts that supported that side, while completely, 100% omitting context and information that didnt support it.  Frankly, when I learned the full story, I was embarrassed to have written what I wrote, because it was so skewed. Users/TomGarberson

20110624 13:40:06 nbsp Just in case it needs to be stated (for anyone following along), I see the use of the internal workings of the Davis Wiki editor community as a metric to compare something to on the Davis Wiki (a reader familiarity assumption) is entirely different than the prelaunch swarming (and how those first opinions tend to settle in) problem Im talking about on the Talk page.   Users/JabberWokky

20110624 13:58:59 nbsp If I get a chance, Ill take a look back.  Off the top of my head, I dont think it covered all of the measures that had already been taken, the recommendations that hadnt been performed, or the times of day the kids were actually outside making the noise.  I remember it skewed the hell out of the story by omitting facts and context.  Doesnt mean the final conclusion was wrong.  But I consider it dishonest for even an opinion piece, much less a news source, to try to lead readers to a conclusion through omissions, rather than including all relevant information and then persuading the reader. Users/TomGarberson

20110624 14:37:25 nbsp Have you actually looked back at what you wrote?  Its extremely rude and condescending.  I still dont think its relevant to what Davis Patch isas opposed to what any of us might have thought itd be before it went livebut whatever.  We apparently disagree on that.

Phil does not have a business in Davis, but FoPaws did split into two businesses, one in Davis with a link on its page, one in Woodland with a link on its page and all are interlinked together for historical context. In my opinion the only argument was from Phil, who tried to lie and manipulate from the get go making it a much larger issue than it actually is. The only issue remaining in light of his activity is whether or not he gets pummeled with the ban hammer for his constant vandalediting of Pawsitive, illegally running a business from his residence (if it exists in Davis at all), and for his continuous threatening behavior up to and including threatening the wiki with lawsuits.

There are also service animals that help fill complicated emotional needs for people who have emotional problems.

My dislike of the terms has much more to do with the abusive animal caretakers who treat an animal  who has the needs and fears and desire for species appropriate comfort  as if they were human children.  That and the mothers of actual children at shows neglecting their biological children in favor of their babies.  More the former than the latter, although I have seen a woman say, in front of her roughly eight year daughter, that she wished she had never had kids so she could pay more attention to her rabbits.  That pointed out, what I mostly dont like is the tendency for people to treat animals as anthropomorphic creatures, which I think is often bad for the poor animal whose needs are simply different than that of a human being. Discovering their strength and quirks and the long journey to understand them for what and who they are is amazing and often humbling. I respect animals, and anthroinfantilizing them has always squicked me.  They arent babies, and I think that it is unfair to force an adult animal into that role to satisfy an adult humans own emotional needs. Users/JabberWokky

20110705 11:15:52 nbsp Yep, Id say thats roughly the same ethical view, just phrased in a different way.  If it werent so early, Id go and play with the mice (but they are nocturnal, and sleeping as hard as they can right now).  Animals are wonderful fun, inspirational and sometimes quite humbling. Users/JabberWokky

20110705 15:03:47 nbsp (sigh) Psst: Phil as an editor and CoFP as a topic are two different things.  Pass it along!  I think Im starting to be confused, and I think there might even be some confusion between Craft of Fo Paws and Fo Paws going on.  Yeesh.  I do agree with your point about it clearly operating for a time and that there should be something written about Craft of Fo Paws on the Davis Wiki, but at this point, Im not sure what it would say, because Im not sure what it actually was (or is, if it still is).  I dont think it can be written rationally right now, but the entry isnt locked, if somebody really wants to wade in and take a shot. Users/JabberWokky

20110705 23:03:48 nbsp I wouldnt say that we overlooked the reason you gave, but rather, we weighed it against everything else and didnt find it compelling. I dont think anyone is trying to be punitive by deleting TCOFP. Were just fed up dealing with an unreliable person and the drama the page attracts, especially considering the marginal value it has to the community. We found an out and we dont have to deal with him on this wiki.  Users/WilliamLewis

20110705 23:29:09 nbsp Youre still saying that the consensus is wrong because we didnt consider something we didnt find compelling. What you said had been said before. We all read it. We all chose to ignore it. No thanks to you, this issue is going to keep on going and going and going. Users/WilliamLewis

 Were just fed up dealing with an unreliable person and the drama the page attracts is not about the business or whats best for Davis or about what makes sense for wiki content. Its about PA. So? The cost of dealing with this issue is far, far greater than the loss to the community if we just stop dealing with this issue for a few months. wl

20110707 09:16:54 nbsp I may have had a skewed view of what happened the other day because I read it all at once after the fact.  It came across to me as Im looking at this the right way, everyone else is looking at it the wrong way, so were doing it my way.  It was that processor rather, my perception of the processthat I found upsetting, not the conclusion.  Anyway, thanks for the apology.  Its appreciated and accepted. Users/TomGarberson

20110707 16:41:10 nbsp Hello again, CP. Thanks for the welcome back. I have no idea what a prochoice city is. To be honest, I think its kind of weird for a city to approve such a highly controversial yet nonbinding resolution, and it therefore stuck out as being an interesting fact in the book Im currently reading, which is why I posted it. My source is Davis from the Inside Out by William Diemer. All he wrote about it was this: 1989: Davis City Council votes 30, with two abstentions,in favor of a resolution to declare Davis to be a ProChoice city, before an overflow crowd at the Vererans Memorial. His source is listed as Davis Enterprise, 1989 YearEnd Edition. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110709 21:56:00 nbsp So my fiancee and I wanted to go to Sequoia Nat. Forest but in May it was still snowed in , with teh longer winter this year :( Instead we went to Yosemite where there are some trails open to Dogs, and we did go to Mariposa Grove (in the snow!). I was able to keep my sincere promise I had made her when she took my to the mountains in Slovenia last summer that I would take her where the Sequoias grow. On the way to Mariposa Grove we also visited a small local coffee roaster (Mariposa Coffee) who showed us his coffee roasting process, and I nted that he makes his blends from pro coffee beans like Ethiopean, El Salvador and Peaberry. It was a very nice trip. I was able to ask her properly with the might of the Sequoias as witnesses and we are getting married next summer :) Users/MichaelNielsen

We still dont know yet exactly what happened only that he was found in his apartment on Tuesday at 12:50pm by the police after a welfare check by the police (found this out after looking at the bulletin boards online).  It is a sad loss. Ill be doing a fundraiser at Little Prague taking donations at the door to help with funeral expenses for him. No cover. not sure if I should set it up as an event here or not...

20110802 20:48:52 nbsp Yeah, there really arent any reliable computer repair people in the Silicon Valley. Seriously, who wants to trust their computer to some kid who started building them out of spare parts tossed out by companies in the area since grade school? Users/hankim

20110802 23:32:26 nbsp Im just tired of getting the raw deal when it comes to the computer business.  I have a carpet cleaning business that I own and Im able to support myself on, but I really dont like doing that kind of work.  Most of the time, I have to do the jobs myself because I dont have anyone else.  Since that is what I have to support myself I have to be practical and keep on doing that business.  There are a lot of people unemployed right now and Im not going quit this business to join them in the unemployment line.
I have a lot of passion for working in the computer biz.  That passion propels me and motivates me to get thing done that I want to do.  In this instance it gets me mad and then I start making plans and putting things into action.
I will have that space and I will not rest until they either move or are out of business.  Since they most likely know nothing about marketing they won’t be able to do anything that is effective enough counter my marketing.  I will dominate the West Davis computer repair market.
 Now I know some people here will bring up this wiki after they read that comment, but my plans have nothing to with this wiki.  Initially, I was frustrated with the situation, wanted to send them an indirect message and the frustration just motivated me to see how far I could push it before someone started saying something.  Just really purely an emotional reaction.
I got the raw deal when I had a room in Fix For Less and Amit Chowdhury wouldn’t give me a key to his front door.  The last few months I was there, several times week he would show up to an hour after he was supposed to open up.  During that time I would be waiting for him to show up so that I could start my business day.  Even though he did that he still expected his $700/mo. rent.  It really pissed me off that I had to be waiting all that time.  The business hasn’t been the same since after a month after I moved out several years ago.
I had been talking to the leasing agent that space.  Even though there is another space in the front that is much more visible from the street they choose this one that is in the back and not visible at all.  That is why it has been vacant for so long.

  Ha!  Too funny.  Ill keep the snarky remarks to myself.  cp

20110804 12:52:07 nbsp That is a good question (what I recommend about a possibly poisonous tree such as Melia). It really isnt possible to remove all toxic plants from the environment. I urge parents of young children to be aware of toxic plants, to know that we are a resource for plant ID if they need to contact Poison Control, and to remove visible and attractive poisonous plant parts. So that would entail raking up and removing the fruit as it falls. A reasonable precaution with small dogs or any that tend to eat things indiscriminately. Having had lots of dogs, I know how variable they are in that regard. Size does make a difference. We lost a chihuahua mix who ate a stick of butter unbeknownst to us. My understanding is that dog poisonings are much less common than children. My semieducated guess is that is because they barf things up.  Users/DonShor

20110817 15:32:29 nbsp It doesnt necessarily have to be cruel; though I couldnt think of a title to change it to that people would use descriptively without objectifying him.  Its a tough scenario.  Samurai Lady is someone doing wushu with a traditional sword, and doesnt seem cruel to me (if inaccurate, as Wushu is Chinese).  Electric Trike Guy is a bit more borderline; whats interesting about the guy IS the trike, but its the context that seems to be disliked there.   To make a page based solely on a disability seems extra rough, doesnt it?  Users/EdWins

20110817 15:57:15 nbsp Actually, I meant he was being cruel in implying that the editors who work hard on keeping things fair here would allow something reprehensible.  A heck of a lot of effort to keep things tactful and nonabusive has gone on, and hes implying that myself and many other people I respect dont give a crap about other people.  That is cruel.

20110817 16:48:47 nbsp On a more constructive note, I was over at EdWins profile and saw your note about the Trike guy.  I do kind of think it should probably go under Unique Vehicles, as its the vehicle (particularly the color) that is notable.  Im not totally sure, as Im not sure it fits as a vehicle. Users/JabberWokky

20110817 16:57:51 nbsp I remembered incorrectly  I thought somebody had said he used it as a wheelchair.  Reading back, that was only idle speculation.  Id say it certainly falls under the category of unique vehicle. Users/JabberWokky

20110817 16:59:44 nbsp that page was originally The Smelliest Man in the World Users/EdWins
   The whole descriptive name in lieu of a known name is tough in that case.  The most respectful that seems to be apt is Berts Bees guy.  Hes certainly well known around town.  The whole entry is thorny and difficult. I do agree with CP in that it is a title that says less about the subject and more about the wiki editorship.  Its not so much that its insulting or not... its just not a good title. jw

20110817 17:10:15 nbsp Frankly, I found that name change somewhat offensive (the smelliest man one).  But I had said my piece on it, and its one of those things where the most persistent voice wins out.  Im not a big fan of sarcasm in lieu of trying to find an appropriate compromise, but Im even less of a fan of revert wars.  Plus, if I had responded at the time, I think it wouldve been a perfect example of editing while angry (I hear you can lose your wiki license for that). Users/TomGarberson

20110817 17:43:21 nbsp Hopefully that is descriptive without being harsh or pointedly, comically nonoffensive. Users/JabberWokky

20110817 18:26:54 nbsp I had three people (one of whom was you) basically saying I dont like it, but I dont want to get into the mess of changing it.  So I figured I might as well make a best effort.  I think its a pretty good descriptive title and hopefully better in most peoples minds than the other two.  Theres still one bit in there that really irks me, but Im leaving it alone to try and keep the changes minimal. Users/JabberWokky

          I took the link of since I did not see a point in having it. The group is not about me nor did I start it. Maybe some day in the future it will grow deeper within the Davis          community, enough to have links, but for now Hankim is right.

Im not dead yet!  Monty Python and the Holy Grail Users/JabberWokky

20110826 00:12:55 nbsp As it states at the top of Death that it is for people, it would be better to have a pet related item at the bottom of the page as a see also.  Also I think the URC should be kept as they probalbly could provide some useful info to inquirers. Users/BruceHansen

20110826 08:14:23 nbsp I totally forgot about the Death page.  There was a reason at the time I didnt remove the URC, and I cant recall the exact scenario, but there were some tensions about something on the wiki.  Users/EdWins

20110826 13:17:54 nbsp Its an option to broaden Death to include people, pets and maybe other road kill or whatever.  It seems that it would be better to have separate pages however.  The URC didnt seem out of place to me or strike me as inappropriate as the link for the pet business did, especially as there was no non human context for it. Users/BruceHansen

20110826 14:30:44 nbsp Sounds like a good link to start things off, thank you.  Users/GuerreroVillarealLopez

20110826 15:44:42 nbsp Could be an interesting article.  I removed it because its the (estimating) fourth or fifth jab Raoul Duke has taken at Rhonda that seems to have little to do with the subject of the page. Users/TomGarberson

20110826 15:58:27 nbsp If its relevant, I have no problem with a link to the article.  Im just kind of tired of knowing that whenever Raouls name pops up on the Monticello page theres going to be another snide remark.  Since his comment (as opposed to the article) seemed to be about Rhonda rather than about Monticello, I removed it from the Monticello page. Users/TomGarberson

20110827 22:33:46 nbsp I went ahead and removed the stuff from Monticello again because it still felt like a dig, rather than actual information about Monticello.  Reading the full article, whose link you added, may well provide some context, but it was behind the paywall for me (it seems completely random whether I hit the paywall when I go to the Enterprise these days).  If you think theres good, Monticellorelevant information in the article, by all means add it.  As I said yesterday, though, Raouls frequent criticisms of Rhonda that arent all that relevant to Monticello dont belong on that page. Users/TomGarberson

20110827 22:52:18 nbsp It seems like a decent thing to have on the page.  Id tend to say that theres already plenty of Rhondas opinion on the page, but I certainly dont think the quote, in full, is problematic.  Am I right in guessing that its talking about Star Ginger?  Theres still a little bit of context missing.

My problem with whats been written so far is twofold: one, its very selective in its quoting and seems like an attack, rather than an attempt to add information.  Two, it really isnt tied into the pageeither the topic or the existing entry content.  If the full quote were on there, or at least a relevant and fair portion of it, and if it were tied into the entry, Id be fine with it.  But because I cant actually read the article, Im reluctant to try and write it up myself.  So, as long as it seems like Raoul is using the Wiki as a weapon, Im going to continue to delete it.  But Ive got no objection to anyone actually adding relevant information from the article to the Monticello entry. Users/TomGarberson

20110828 21:54:21 nbsp Hi Professor,

FYI: I clarified my follow up phone conversation with Bob Dunning on the Monticello page.  It also sounds like you have some issues with me that perhaps you would like to discuss over a beer, glass of wine or nonalcoholic beverage.  Of course, perhaps we could have a Wiki party at the restaurant and I could meet all of the guys (and gals?) who seem to make this Wiki engine tick.  Users/RhondaGruska

20110828 22:25:47 nbsp I was reading through your restaurant reviews, and user thai you dont have KetMoRee, and I was wondering if you have eaten there or not.  Users/NikhilDahal

20110828 22:41:19 nbsp I always called it Thai 2k, but it was 2k Thai food
I can see how you think KetMoRee is like that, but they have the nightclub, and if they didnt try, it wouldnt be happening.
So yeah they do try, and it is quite/pretty/real successful In Davis  (despite the comments, but hey if we believed in the comments, no businss in Davis would be successful)
But they do Try really hard on the restaurant part, hell even though Im
A busser, I try to make sure that customer service is top notch.

They did do renovations within the restaurant, which helped the dinner service and nightclub (they opened a room that can seat 18 people tablewhich helped alot during graduation and it can apparently hold an extra 50 people during picnic day)

 Users/NikhilDahal

20110828 22:46:48 nbsp And the nightclub is like an all alcohol restaurant as in once you start a restaurant, you have to try to maintain it, and make it successful (see the lines on picnic day/graduation) practically at any bar
Im pretty sure thats the same with any restaurant/bar that is open til 2am on the Thurssat Users/NikhilDahal

20110828 23:04:13 nbsp I agree with you 100%, a restaurant will attract some people, and wont to others.
And many people will come out on the weekend from Davis and from outside Davis(as do many other bars)

From my year working at Ketmo I think KetMoRee attracts all ages, and I can say Burgers&Brew does as well, I wouldnt know for the other thai restaurants as for I dont patronize at them(obviously haha),
But I do agree with alot of what you say (please excuse  all my spelling errors for Im
On my phone and it randomly goes to the next line etc etc) Users/NikhilDahal

20110830 16:21:28 nbsp Reading their website, I guess they are looking for a pub/bar. Not sure if it qualifies as a job posting though (which makes it sort of offtopic and I am used to spammers just going for whatever is remotely on topic)? Its more like looking for venue? Just it being in the jobs section made me think they were looking for some kind of Tupperwaretype thing.  Users/hankim

20110830 16:31:16 nbsp Might be wrong then. I guess the posting just hit all my suspicious spammer flags when it might be legitimate.  Users/hankim

20110830 17:42:19 nbsp Nyuk nyuk!  I like the Enterprise well enough, aside from the paywall.  Not the best newspaper out there, but its pretty good for being so intensely local.  The Vanguards the only one I have a problem with :) Users/TomGarberson

20110830 18:20:00 nbsp Yeah, on a more serious note, I think the Enterprise is OK, too.  But I really dont get what happened.  They made this big fanfare about going online, but then it seemed as though within a few short weeks they put up the paywall.  (Perhaps the number of subscribers dropped precipitously?)  Im a print subscriber so the paywall doesnt affect me, and I get that newspapers are having a tough time out there, but I think they owed us a bit more communication about what happened (communication being their business, after all).  As for the Vanguard, I know theyre not your favorite, but they do often cover stories, or cover them in more depth, than the Enterprise does, so I value it for that.  Plus theyve got a number of regular commenters who are happy to point out any flaws in their articles, so that helps to fill out the picture.  I particularly like it when Sue Greenwald or one of the other Council members comment  I feel like I find out more there than elsewhere. Users/CovertProfessor

Today, user/williamlewis deleted user/evewestbessier because he arbitarily called it an ad.  We are endeavoring to provide information on Eve as a community asset, included a Comment field and more.  It is not my intention to create an ad, but a more complete and useful Wiki for others to enjoy.  Other musicians have similar, although less developed Wikis.  Can you or someone restore EveWebBessiers wiki, provide guidance to whats going to be acceptable and keep things civil.  I dont believe summarily deleted a persons Wiki is consistent with the Wikis mission and ethos.  Thanks in advance for helping me understand how we can avoid miscommunication on this issue in the future.

20110914 12:57:31 nbsp Partly because I don;t want to get into some kind of secret menu debate, as has happened with others on other sites, for ordering a lasagna that does not appear on their standard menu... Partly just because I am in a bit of a bitter mood at the moment and want some time to think about it before I just post negative things about any establishment (save for the con artist Moller and his flying car scam) Users/WesP

20110914 13:02:18 nbsp I will say this for you though: If you do want to try the Lasagna, they will tell you its a seasonal special and it is served in a small casserole dish with rigatoni pasta and not the standard lasagna style pasta. It looks great, just was overly oily, overcooked and just a mess when I received mine. Maybe it was a rare case, they are new...

20110915 04:01:55 nbsp I would have no problem removing the entire talk page on ethnic groups and ethnicism if it would avoid any type of heated and possibly hateful conversation. The point I was attempting to make was one that promotes pride, yes, but also seems to have an underlying segregationist aspect rather than one of inclusion for all. I would feel this way about an all Caucasian group as well. It does nothing to eliminate ethnicism, only makes the point that we are different much stronger in peoples minds. I was just kind of wondering if I was in the minority in thinking this way, or if it does seem to bring more attention to the differences in people rather than point out there similarities in others minds as well.

I dont know why he would lash out against you the way he did...  Users/WesP

20110915 17:34:13 nbsp I think I may have come across a logical way to handle all of the cab drama, business drama in general, honestly. It is a requirement that all businesses have a copy of their business license as well as their sellers permits (if they are in that field) to be viewable on the premises and displayed for all to see who request it. Is this a possibility here? Simply request each business post a copy on the wiki to be visible by all... It truly would put an end to over 90% of the dramatic discussions, in my opinion. What do you think?  Users/WesP

20110915 17:43:59 nbsp Thanks for kicking in the sobering reality.  The economic disparity along some lines is utterly terrifying.  Its such a concrete issue, it crosses the various ways to look at racial equality and starkly demonstrates that something is fundamentally broken.  After spending some time in DC, Im hesitant to even call them racial lines, despite it being an issue of race: there are AfricanAmericans locked in generations long patterns of destitute hopelessness, and others of the same race who are all college bound and very prosperous.  Its not really surprising, of course, as race doesnt really have anything to do with capability... but the enmity between the two groups did startle me, and I saw it over and over from several different people.  To give it an odd twist, I also talked about that specific subject with two first generation African immigrants who were happy to talk about the situation as they saw it, and while I couldnt quite grasp their perspective (their debate back and forth carried some assumptions I probably missed), both agreed that dating in DC was almost impossible if youre black and not clearly one of one of the two established groups. Users/JabberWokky

20110915 21:49:17 nbsp Im absolutely not trying to diminish racism or sexism as issues by themselves.

I have two document boxes full of books that I have intend to read (there are a few other piles that are semiinteresting, but those two boxes are recommended books or otherwise high on my list).  Im pretty sure Oryx and Crake is in there.  To be honest, Ive been writing two books and putting together another writing heavy project, which has been slowing my reading.  Instead, Im surrounded by piles of books about odd topics (Middle Eastern mythology, 1930s America and noir cinema) jammed full of postitsFootnote(This is a bad idea, by the way, for books that you want to keep.  I know better.) instead and I am constantly flipping back and forth through them looking for oddball references and details.  In short Im in synthesis mode rather than reading mode.

20110930 12:26:30 nbsp The Strelitzia comment fell short on virtually every criterion weve used in the past in trying to determine whether serious accusations should remain on a page.  It also stayed on there for a long time and no one else came forth to support it, and the person who left it never answered the questions that were asked of her.  Its analogous to the highly suspicious positive comments that we remove from pages all the time.  You cant be certain its BS, but it had a lot going against it and not much for it.  Only, unlike the positive comments, the impact of leaving it on the wiki is significant. Users/TomGarberson
   With all due respect, Tom, the criterion we have used in the past changes year to year as far as I can tell back to 2005.   (And like CP, I disagree that it wasnt there).  Additionally, it seems that its still floating.   A year ago, people used to throw tantrums over driveby editors not using a real name.  And then a regular wikieditor posts something about a taxi, and the new complaint was why isnt there a police report?

20111124 12:29:04 nbsp Because of her actions, or lack of actions, since the event itself. She has been slow to take responsibility, slow to condemn the actions, dribbled out bits of information (some of it conflicting), and not shown any indication that she is capable of bringing about real change. She reacts to events and to negative publicity, rather than being proactive.

Fundamentally, the Chancellor is the face and voice of the University.  Tragedies happen, even in the best of times and under the best of planning and with great forethought.  Even ignoring the entire specifics of the event itself, one of the key roles of a Chancellor  as that face and voice  is to respond with calm and certain communication in the aftermath of an event like this.  Even with zero culpability in the events that led to the police action, even if Pike acted as a rogue, unpredictable element, then her response was slow, incoherent and  even to this date  carries no firm and unequivocally stated steps to move forward in any direction that might benefit the institution she speaks for.  She speaks passively of the actions of others, and displays none of the characteristics that are needed in a leader of a major university.

In summary: even disregarding the event itself, her poor response to it causes grave concerns for her core ability to lead the University as Chancellor. Users/JabberWokky
  I agree completely.  Well said.  cp

20111124 12:38:36 nbsp I will also note that there appears to be a large segment of the UCD student body who hates the whole Occupy issue and fracas over the pepper spraying incident and just wants to go to class.  They are vocal elsewhere, but their point of view seems to be wholly unrepresented on the wiki.  Im not sure how to cultivate capturing that perspective in parallel without running a very high risk of nasty, dismissive acts (which have already happened). Users/JabberWokky
  I think there are two groups that need to be distinguished here.  The first is a very small group who defends the pepper spraying of the protesters.  I have zero sympathy for that group; anyone who watches those videos and who thinks the cops were justified has lost their sense of empathy and has issues with violence and dominance, in my opinion.  The second and larger group are those who are upset that their classes are being canceled and disrupted  theyve worked hard to get into UCD and to stay in UCD, and they dont understand the logic of canceling classes in order to protest high tuition.  I have a great deal of sympathy for this second group, which is not to say that I think those who skip or cancel class are wrong, just that I can see both sides of the debate.  cp
     I have not heard of any of the former who have ties to UCD (and I dont think any had ties to Davis at all), merely kneejerk blowhards trying to either shock or pander to simplistic views.  Of course, I am not dismissing the possibility that theres somebody in Davis who, through either ignorance or dogmatic trust, believes it was a reasonable act.  However, I was entirely referring to the latter category.  Twitter, Reddit, and Slashdot have all had very strong commentary from selfproclaimed students to the effect that they are compassionate to the situation, but there is an entire institution suffering.  Some have supported Occupy, some have not, but most are upset that their classes are needlessly disrupted (the needlessly being their opinion).
    On another topic, there are some good interviews out there with UCD students.  By and large in the media slice Ive been following, the student body is sounding very articulate and able to present the situation well.  Theres a bit of comparison in my mind between Penn State versus UCD in this  or at least their ability to withstand media scrutiny  and UCD is coming out ahead.
      JW, there were some students in the town hall (at least one or two  I didnt listen to the whole thing) who defended the polices action.  There are those übermilitaristic types out there.  As for the latter category, I know it from talking from my students, so Ive done my best to walk a balance between accommodating those who want to protest and those who dont want any disruption.  I agree that the UCD students overall have come off very well.  cp
    Sarah just popped her head around from the kitchen as I read this aloud and said, Penn State students came off as rabid idiots, and UC Davis students had valid points of view? in a statement of mock shock. jw
       Actually I think the first group has just plain lost their minds. I cannot see the first sides points as valid...just cant. Users/PeterBoulay
        I agree.  cp
        That is, I believe, what I said: their reasons are not related to the action.  They are taking a position based on incorrect information, or based on prior dogmatic beliefs about law enforcement entirely unconnected to this event.  Thus, they are not commenting on the actual pepper spraying event no matter how much they might insist they are.  Ive heard people talk about how the crowd of students were forcing the cops inside a tight circle, or blocking their access to escape by physically barring access to the police car.  In one case, the person was saying that it was justified because of the bricks being thrown at police in normal uniforms (i.e., no riot protection).   The rest are simply siding with their side, which has nothing to do with the pepper spraying and is merely a dogmatic, kneejerk response.
       In completely unrelated observations on the commentary, Ive heard two exUCDPD officers who watched the video state that the spraying was totally uncalled for and way over the line; one said that their action would have been to peaceably wait, merely standing there to observe in case there was a need (implying that there wasnt really one given the circumstances he saw on the video).  The other commented that the current chief was the worst boss hes ever had in law enforcement (this was shortly afterwards, before CK made her comments).  jw

20111129 17:03:48 nbsp Agreed. It astounds me that the UCD lawyer got a salary increase of $45,000. His raise is more than most people make in a year. That money alone could cover about nine TA stipends at 50% for a quarter.

20111130 21:39:53 nbsp I removed a http://daviswiki.org/Occupy_Davis?actiondiff&version2323&version1322 common lie that has been circulating around the Occupy Movement. Corporate personhood predates the Citizens United ruling by a century or two. The ruling did not establish any new rights for corporations. It simply held that the FECs restrictions on electioneering communications 60 days prior to a primary election or 30 days prior to a general election were a violation of the first amendment. These restrictions applied to corporations (including nonprofits like the ACLU) and individuals alike. The electioneering communication standard used by the FEC was especially troubling. It held that Fahrenheit 911 was not an electioneering communication because the point of the movie was to make money. If you actually care about your message and arent motivated by profit? Too bad, the FEC wants to regulate you. Users/WilliamLewis

20111201 09:48:17 nbsp The inequity refers to the (IMO erroneous) conclusion, and the conclusion thus explains the accusation.  Its not my conclusion, but understanding that theres a segment pushing the idea that Occupy is racist is important to note.  That has nothing to do with any actual racial makeup or even any actual fact, its merely a statement that some people are using their conclusion that there is inequity to pitch that the Occupy movement is racist.  It seems to be the popular move in the last couple decades to try and marginalize groups and individuals you disagree with (doubly horrific when it causes blase about actual racism). Users/JabberWokky

20111201 09:51:40 nbsp If you follow my tortured statement above, see http://daviswiki.org/Occupy_Davis?actiondiff&version2337&version1335 this edit where I tried to work it into the phrasing.  It could probably be clarified even more.  Something along, accusations of racism are based on claims of inequity, drawn from the observation that or even ...drawn from the perception that.  Something along those lines might make it more clear that the inequity is referring to a conclusion, much like racist. Users/JabberWokky

20111201 10:20:49 nbsp The term racist?  Yes, thats the going angle on various websites with words like patriot and red in the domain name.  Its not helping that the likes of David Duke and various Nazi groups have tried to support the movement (and been kicked out of a few gatherings).  Even FOX has dabbled in it of late.  Its certainly one of the handfuls of mud being slung. Users/JabberWokky

20111201 10:24:55 nbsp Incidentally, keep in mind that this is all in relation to an act occurring in Davis Occupy: people yelling White Power protesters.  I wouldnt have even raised it otherwise. Users/JabberWokky

20111201 19:20:51 nbsp Ah, yes.  It is conjecture, the same as the conjecture that the people yelling are white supremacists.  I think its a slightly more likely theory given that its being yelled at a particular group (as opposed to, say, Farmers Market vendors), and it fits in with the same stereotypes that are causing the thrown coins.  But yes, both explanations are certainly conjecture.  I just thought the first was on fairly shaky legs, as it didnt seem to fit the pattern (one group targeted, and the coins also being an aggressive act mocking the stereotype of Occupy among detractors).

20111206 19:31:36 nbsp When I visited the camp on the quad over thanksgiving, I talked to somebody there who nicely explained the etiquette of living there. Luckily I had a house to stay in, but I asked him about the goals for the protest such as full funding of the University (which I think is appropriate as in the master plan you have referred to). He said that there wasnt consensus on full funding as a goal, and the only consensus was on establishing a democratic means of recalling the chancellor. I think thats not a bad goal, but if thats in response to the Chancellors response to the protest, then what was the protest for before that? It also occurs to me that the Regents and Legislature are probably more likely to sacrifice the Chancellor than setup full funding anyway. The protests I have attended were at the state Capitol which I think should be a more effective venue than the quad and even those seemed like a circus to me. At least the person I spoke to on the quad said that they had made some trips to the Capitol and Regents meetings to lobby though for some of their goals. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20111206 20:00:03 nbsp I think protests without clear goals are a common problem in post industrial societies. Unfair labor practices and pollution in foreign countries are even more abstract here than police actions in Berkeley, so hype and fear mongering are rampant. I wish the protests at the Wisconsin capitol had worked, they seemed much clearer to me than the Occupy movement. I think recalling Scott Walker still has a chance though.

Regarding DW frustration, Sacwiki still needs work!  :)  Its actually been a nice sanctuary for me, when things get out of hand over here.  I feel like I can get back to some of the real reasons why I started editing over here, i.e., sharing local knowledge, documenting, etc, (probably helps that I lived there for a while, too). Also, the mapping stuff they are doing over there is pretty awesome, which I like a lot.

Totally understand your feelings about original wiki aesthetic though.
