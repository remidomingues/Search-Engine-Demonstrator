On 2010 City Council Election June 8th, 2010, Mayor Don Saylor ran unopposed for the District 2 seat on the Yolo County Board of Supervisors that is being vacated due to Helen Thomson‘s retirement after 36 years in elected office.  He will take office on January 3rd, 2011, thus leaving his seat on the Davis City Council vacant.  That seat’s regular election occurs in June 2012.

The remaining City Council members (Rochelle Swanson, Stephen Souza, Joe Krovoza, and Sue Greenwald) gave initial direction to City Staff in December 2010 to begin drafting a process to appoint Saylors replacement.
