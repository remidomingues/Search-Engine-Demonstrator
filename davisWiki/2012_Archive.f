If you didnt want your digital information to be used for something (even if stated otherwise), then you shouldnt have joined (cause that possibility always exists anytime you transmit over any medium)

and if you really object to the circumstances in which this slapdickery occurred, go try and kill the wikispot project thru litigation or something productive.

We know something went down and we (the community, and the people with the keys) are apparently trying to rectify it, and if you want to continue to be a killjoy that is your choice to make Users/StevenDaubert

20120110 23:38:50 nbsp you dont seem to understand the back end, which is fine. As far as I can tell Nicholas Barry was granted access inadvertently when his user was elevated when he took on responsibilities for the SacWiki Wikispot switch. Did Nicholas seek out this position of great power with malice in his heart, or was he simply trying to get everyone under the wikispot house on the same page??? Was he wrong in using these great powers for grey area tactics. This seems like a case of a user in a group overstepping his bounds with access, granted that comes attached with the privacy can of worms, but from a technical standpoint (one that Mike and Phillip are apparently going to address tomorrow)

ah  it I dont really care

20120122 19:36:37 nbsp Romneycare refers specifically to the healthcare system in Massachusetts. Maybe Im running in the wrong circles, but Ive never heard of PPACA referred to as Romneycare. Users/WilliamLewis

20120122 19:54:56 nbsp How the hell is it a loaded term? http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/healthreformimplementation/185877presidentembracesobamacarelabel The president apparently approves of it, even. Users/WilliamLewis

20120122 20:01:13 nbsp Its associating Obamas signature accomplishment with his name. Its only considered derogatory in some circles because its not the most popular thing in the world. The term itself is neutral. Anyway, youre still associating Romneycare with PPACA, which is erroneous.  Users/WilliamLewis

20120125 20:03:06 nbsp The actual relevant link from Navigating Campus would be Navigating Davis > Surface Streets > Campus.

20120130 13:49:17 nbsp Hi there! Question for you.....I just noticed zenkids clothing, an online only shop. So does that mean we can all put our webshops here on the daviswiki if we ourselves live in davis, or if we offer a special deal to davis residents? Or only if they are homemade? I sell plastic beads and hair things at www.snapaholics.com, but aint none of it handmade! I never thought of putting it on the wiki because its a webshop....but it would be great if my store came up if people put in beads in the search field. I sell a ton of plastic beads in lots of shapes, you cant find in stores. Thanks! StephHolm Users/StephHolm

20120206 22:43:36 nbsp Im not trying to ignore other editors.  I just dont want to look at my user page until I know that the troll discussion is moved somewhere else for now, like a directory of my user page (like /Trolling Accusation).  As I commented to Ed, Im not quite ready to finish that discussion and I dont want to see it until I am ready.  Ill be glad to use my user page when I know that that is moved.  Im glad to discuss things now, but not in the context of trolling.  Thank you. Users/BruceHansen

20120206 23:26:50 nbsp I dont know if my user page still has the trolling discussion  the last time I read it there was a discussion about that with me, JW and MW  and if its not there, where is it  removed or moved to another page? Users/BruceHansen

20120208 11:32:28 nbsp Im betting youre right.  I just find erring on their side makes things both more pleasant and puts a spotlight on people who would lie about things for their own advancement. Users/JabberWokky

20120210 13:18:00 nbsp CP.... I just read over his page & its clear Bruce simply isnt WILLING to work this issue out...its gone beyond simple nonunderstanding on his part.

20120211 18:54:35 nbsp Cool! Im glad to hear the red bean buns from Kims are at least acceptable. Ill give them a shot as well one of these days. If you ever track down the perfect red bean bun or cake somewhere in the Sac/Davis area, let me know! Users/ScottMeehleib

20120218 14:45:10 nbsp Actually, Id say that the wiki is a place where the many conflicting values can be recorded and found, rather than things like news and formal sources, which are more concerned with facts.  The wiki is (ideally) effective at showing both of  and also the difference between  the law of the land and the current cultural sense of what is just.  Of course, this makes it even a wider gap between aiming for a purely factual presentation and many other peoples goals. Users/JabberWokky

20120218 17:37:57 nbsp Yep.  Other than a nitpicky bit about objective conclusions that doesnt really affect the practical upshot of things, were pretty much in agreement. Users/JabberWokky

20120220 13:56:30 nbsp Thanks for checking in with me. I misread the # and thought they were exact. I am wrong here and have retracted the banners. I still have concerns about the similar nature of the comments. Users/PeterBoulay

20120223 23:39:57 nbsp Haha.  Honestly, as much as I still feel I was deprived of my opinions there, I not going to reopen the discussion.  I did have ideas on BW that I felt were important, and to be fair, there were a few outright deletions at the outset that rubbed me the wrong way.  But youre right, X4 people votedX a community process was put in place to remove it.  Thats the imperfect nature of this wiki, so for now Im cool with it. Users/jefftolentino
  Passive aggressive and bitter is not a good combination. Just let it go. Megan

20120224 16:41:07 nbsp I guess my original comment on the EW page last night was saying the same thing.  There have been long standing traditions, and people are always going to find other peoples editing style unacceptable, etc, but there have been exceptions to the rules in the past, and no matter what you say, it will never be a hard and fast game.  Not taking sides on either one of you guys discussion there, just saying the rules are not fixed.  Users/jefftolentino

20120301 09:11:50 nbsp The presence of plastic bags in nature is a really weak argument for banning them. Are there really no other, less drastic solutions to that problem? Users/jsogul
 Is this tongueincheek? Serious question. M
   Assuming that he is serious... the http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id5139:windstormlittersdaviscountrysidewithplasticbagsrightbeforenrcconsiderssingleusebagordinance&Itemid86 article that I linked to was not meant to be a fullscale argument for why plastic bags should be banned.  Those arguments have been made elsewhere, including on the Ban Plastic Bags page.  Rather, the article was meant to respond to people like Bob Dunning who have claimed that everyone is reusing the bags and that he doesnt see how they could get into the waterways.  Obviously, people are not reusing them, or even if they are, they end up in the landfill and then escaping from the landfill  and yes, there they are, in the waterways.  They dont have to go to the ocean to be a problem for wildlife.  They are costly to cleanup, and for a town that goes out of its way to preserve open space, unsightly and ugly.  Sure, we wouldnt need to pass a law if people would just do the right thing and use cloth bags.  Obviously, that is not happening, and the pictures in the article demonstrate that very clearly.  Again, I dont think Ive even given all of the arguments against plastic bags.  Another one is that they are simply wasteful  use once or maybe twice, and then throw away.  We need to get out of that mentality.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120301 12:35:08 nbsp I actually use and reuse plastic bags for a variety of odd reasons, some of which are not bag related (I use them as dropcloths in painting small objects, etc).  I find them amazingly handy to have.  Im enough of an oddball in that regard that Id probably buy them for nongrocery purposes (likely a roll of the veggie style bags).  Then again, I dont think my use is really the problem being addressed.  I also use packaging peanuts as fill for models. Users/JabberWokky

  Actually, http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Patch?actiondiff&version227&version126 I wrote the original text and http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Patch?actiondiff&version240&version139 WL added the link. Glad to hear, though, we can continue to move forward.  I think your site, and you in particular, have done a lot of good work, particularly with the Occupy movements.

    Don, re: There is no way a bacterium can insert its genetic material into a plant in nature. They aren’t even in the same category of organism, much less order, family, genus, or species. Absolutely not true, youd be surprised at how DNA shuffles around.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer horizontal gene transfer.  I know several examples of transfer between bacteria and eukaryotes.  Excuse a nitpick from a scientist on that sentence, but DNA is pretty amazing, and plants have crazy genomes.  Otherwise, I completely agree with your point that its virtually impossible for it to happen and be selected for, much less isolated by us, in the wild. ES
     I should have known better than to say there is no way!  Thanks. DS

20120317 21:32:55 nbsp Good point.  I was more concerned that somebody with little life experience might think that they couldnt get care without insurance or paperwork.  Couple that with the lack of comprehension of the frailty of life found in the same group, and it can lead to tragedy that could have been avoided.  Its a good point to make, however: 911 also dispatches the closest EMT on priority transportation to your location; youll likely see a medical professional (although not a doctor) quicker than you could driving yourself in.

20120318 17:21:19 nbsp Heres the FAA rule,

 Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91 GENERAL OPERATING AND FLIGHT RULES
 Subpart BFlight Rules
 General

 Sec. 91.119

 Minimum safe altitudes: General.

 Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:
 (a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.
 (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle     within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
 (c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be  operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.
 (d) Helicopters, powered parachutes, and weightshiftcontrol aircraft. If the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface
 (1) A helicopter may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, provided each person operating the helicopter complies with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA; and
 (2) A powered parachute or weightshiftcontrol aircraft may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) would be the appropriate paragraph.  Ive followed cars on Road 105 while practicing slow flight.  The first time I maintained a 600 distance.  After thinking about it, I realized that drivers would have no way of knowing the distance and might report me anyway, so I dont do it anymore. Users/JimStewart

20120403 20:05:39 nbsp I dont see all those points as valid in my experience.

I, however, refuse to blame the entire nondisabled population (even if its not specifically their fault) for a lack of curb cuts on sidewalks. Users/PeterBoulay

20120403 20:17:08 nbsp Nope. I dont get the irony at all. Irony is usually lost on the target of the irony though, so Im not surprised. Users/BrentLaabs

20120403 20:41:03 nbsp Actually Im trying to respond to your other point now by making productive edits.

So I responded to her flippant comment with another flippant comment.   Her comment was obviously not intended to actually inform. At that point in time, I was thinking check your privilege, what does that even mean? And her immediate conclusion is that I responded that way because Im a white male. That is prejudice. She made a judgement about my reactions because she knows I am white and male.  You may not understand my reactions because you dont disclose your identity on the wiki, but Megan definitely made a decision based on who I am and not what I said. Users/BrentLaabs

20120404 01:43:16 nbsp Its the fact that she dismissed my comment because Im white and male, not because Im a jerkass. The leap in her logic goes from Those people might need to chill and realize that one cant get everything one asks for to being put in a group of white males who brush off legitimate concern.  The subtext being that Im just like all of those other white males.

Lets assume that the name Occupy is a legitimate concern for the sake of argument.  Might need to chill is still a pretty weak statement.  Her response  not deleting it  not arguing that Im wrong  not setting it off as an opposing view  no, it was, as I understand now, a statement that I didnt understand because of my privilege.  It was dismissive based on who I am.  Even flippant, you might say, and based on who I am.

But thats no big deal.  Its that she went on to clarify that I cant understand because Im a white man.  Thats when I got upset. I am aware that I enjoy special status in this society for being white and being male.  Theres no question of that.  But her tone is so dismissive of my opinion and my status that theres no question it was a racist statement. And I just feel that the wiki should delete harmful words like that, rather than leave it on and incite these long threads.
 Users/BrentLaabs
 Amen.   Users/JeffTolentino

20120404 10:59:04 nbsp Oh, this is nowhere near the worst thing that could happen to me.  In fact, because of my privilege, I can safely ignore this prejudice.

The argument has always been that her statement doesnt belong on the wiki.  It still doesnt. Users/BrentLaabs

20120404 11:13:19 nbsp Okay.  Can you rewrite the section so that its no longer an attack on one person?  Or an assumption about all white males? Users/BrentLaabs

20120405 00:07:11 nbsp Im sorry I havent responded to you.  I appreciate the explanations.  I really do.  Its just... I dont know how far I want to go down the rabbit hole with this.  I dont agree with you, and the reasons arent in your argument  which is sound on its own merits  but in the philosophical assumptions you make in making your argument.  Im sensing you may have the same problems with me.  Do you want to continue discussing this anyway, at this time? Users/BrentLaabs

20120405 20:05:48 nbsp Yes :) Users/TomGarberson

20120406 02:39:00 I think I only asked you two question: what is check your privilege, which Meggo sardonically answered for me, and asking you to explain why you didnt see her statement as racist.  I think you saw the fact that I wasnt being convinced as asking questions.  So I guess it really is time to go into the whole can of worms.

Okay, lets get in to the fundamental reason I dont agree with you.  At its very root, its because Im a pragmatist.  Radically so.  When I was in high school, I guess I would have considered myself a romantic.  But it came with my experience in the working policy arm of ASUCD.  Id see person after person come through with ideas that I generally believed in, but have no idea how to realize the idea in any kind of rational action, and well, it gets frustrating after a while.

Sure, I agree that people of color are oppressed, that white people have privilege.  Thats confirmed both by experience and data.  And there are actions that we can take to rectify these things.  If capital punishment routinely leads to extra and unnecessary punishment against people of color, why not just abolish it?  Wed even save money in the process.  Or if black people have less capital due to historic consequences of their ancestors servitude and deprivation of voting rights, reparations could be a reasonable possibility.  While I have my doubts that it could be implemented pragmatically, at the very least it is an actual action to take that could rectify a documented problem.

But what I dont understand is an attempt to bring about social change using the politics of division.  I hate identity politics.  I hate identity politics because it a tool that divides people.  Dont stop reading:  Certainly, recognizing divisions that already exist does not create division.  Its how its applied in practice which creates the divisions.

By creating an ideology around a privileged class that responsible for the oppression of another class, you automatically create an other.  Those people who are attacking us.  Students for an Orwellian Society The them that is against the we. It doesnt matter if we white folk deserve the blame.  Its the act of affixing blame that intensifies divisions.

So when I turn on the news, I see tales of the liberals War on Christmas, or the muslims building their Terror Mosque.  TV is pretty conservative.  On the campus I heard endless complaints about how the University isnt admitting enough people of color.

Its not fucking helping. All of this complaining doesnt do a damn thing.  If theres actual policy to go with it, fine. Or out of the world of public policy, at least something that can improve the lives of people as a whole.  But more often than not, its turns into a game of everyone beat up the person who said something inappropriate and carefully worded apology I dont believe in.

As it turns out, pretty much all white people know that they have privilege in this country.  And the ones who dont, well, you cant do anything about idiocy.  The way Megan used check your privilege in her statement?  It implies that I am wrong because I dont understand the life experience of others who are less privileged.  That I am the other, and that I am brushing her off because I cant understand the we.

But let me offer a radical alternative to that assumption.  Both of you are wrong.  Attacking the name Occupy is simply a bad idea.  The word occupy is simply not a tool of oppression.  I cant see an evil dictator anywhere saying something akin to Im going to occupy you, you occupee bastards.  And if you come from an occupied country, where the government routinely tortures you or denies your freedom for being from a certain ethnic group, I genuinely feel sorry for you.  But changing the name does virtually nothing to actually nothing to improve the conditions over in said country.

Heres where pragmatism comes back in.  If Im from a disenfranchised group, do I: (1) Join an increasingly popular nationwide movement that wants to improve the conditions of my people along with all others who are disenfranchised, and to diminish the extreme power and wealth of those oppress us; or (2) Complain that the name makes me feel uncomfortable, uncomfortable in a way that no one can understand but one of us, so I cant take part unless they attempt a national rebranding of an established volunteer movement.

Option (2) is simply not pragmatic, not at all.  If you think that being privileged makes us exempt from compromise on things we dont agree with, youre wrong.  I find many politicians support for the death penalty, for example, President Obama, morally repugnant.  Im going to vote for him anyway, because, well, thats what I can get for now.  That does not mean we should not strive for better.  It means that we should take what is best now.

I do not live in a idealistic world where I aim for a huge, romantic world revolution.  I look for best available solutions.  And I hope that little by little, pragmatically, we finally crack the worlds shell, and bring about the world revolution.  So, I checked my privilege, and decided that if I was in a similar life to yours, I would still disagree with you. Maybe I would be feel better if the name was changed.  Maybe I would think of it as a way to take back the word, and occupy the occupiers.  But either way, my pragmatic side would prevail and Id support the Occupy Movement.

Im not really clear as to whether the assumption is that because of my white male privilege I cannot understand the situation, or that I brushed off the concerns because as a white male I wouldnt try and comprehend another view.  But the thing is, I did try to understand it from another point of view, since walking in another mans shoes is at the basis of morality.  And as to the former question, the homeland of my ancestors was occupied by a foreign power for 300 years, and only got independence last century.  But, you wouldnt know that about me, because you just assumed an ethnic profile about me based on what you know about white male privilege.

Saying that privilege exists is a fact.  Saying that someone is exercising it, like so many other members of their group, is an allegation and a stereotype.  Which is where we come back to identity politics.  The lines are sometimes vague and indistinct, but they are there.  The line between promoting ones own groups standing, and diminishing another group.  Which is why I cant stand identity politics in practice.

It turns out that this matter was at the heart of ASUCDs dispute with UCSA, where, through some strange twist of fate, I ended up in the eye of the storm.  UCSA, through a feedback relationship with USSA, is primarily an identity politics organization.  They really wanted to bring affirmative action back, pass the Dream Act, and spend time accusing the Regents of not caring about students, especially ethnic minority students.  You know, issues that Schwarzenegger would veto in a heartbeat.  ASUCD even voted to support a graduate student issue because it actually seemed like the only pragmatic goal.

Unfortunately, no one in UCSA wanted to do normal political lobbying.  You know, going to assemblymembers, giving them proposals for laws, and sitting down and talking like normal human beings. Because they didnt understand  couldnt understand  and because it was much more fun to yell at people, they organized protest events, which always felt ridiculous and shoestring.  And its not that I hate activists  the tail of the curve is necessary for any real social change.  Its that they didnt do the pragmatic things, too.  And that was really too bad, because I so, so badly wanted them to succeed.  In fact, I still pray for them to succeed, because students so badly need adequate represenation and good ideas at the capitol. But when it comes down to it, I stood virtually alone in supporting UCSA at the end in ASUCD, because so many conservatives in were turned off and wedged out by the identity politics.

I know thats amazingly offtopic, but it means that Ive been thinking about these issues for years, and have radically different conclusions than you have.  So to me, my comment had nothing at all to do with privilege or brushing off criticism.  It is my recommendation as a policy analyst that the people calling for a name change to chill.  Because creating a wedge issue here gains them nothing, and in fact weakens a movement that aims to help them.  Because asking for this is not pragmatic  they cannot get everything they want from this one movement.

And so, all of the allegations of white privilege are not related to my actions at all.  They were assumptions made about my actions based on a profile.  A stereotype.  A prejudice.  I suppose that this is easier to swallow than the other alternative: that she is wrong.  Racism is always easier than the truth.
 Users/BrentLaabs
  I wholeheartedly agree with Brents message here.  JT
   Yes, I get it that people are defending the assertion that MW is a racist, as they have been doing all along.  I am appalled, disappointed, and discouraged.  Users/CovertProfessor
    Ill defend the other side... it is trivializing an incredibly serious charge to use it in that situation.  It was a racial statement, not racist.  I can absolutely see why it would upset: there are two ways to view racism, by individual and by group.  People who hold one view tend to think the other view is naive or unaware (and sometimes that is true).  Flinging charges when there is a fundamentally different view of racial models means that the gap can never be bridged.  And yes, that means there will be implication of racism by group, which people who see it as an individual issue translate to a personal charge of racism.  But to disregard the fact that it was not a personal charge is either disingenuous, simply ignorant (not a bad thing), or an act of willful activism.  If I may: Brent, do you think M is racist, or that the philosophical view of racial relations that is common and that she subscribes to  due to the way it applies assumptions to groups by skin color  is inherently racist?  I do understand that you could commute, but a little abstraction here could go a long way toward reengaging in a meaningful discussion. jw
    CP, If you dont like the term racist, thats fine.  The bottom line is MW made a generalization about BL based on both race and sex.  She made assumptions about BLs individual views, based on a racial stereotype about a group, regardless of how privileged that group may or may not be perceived.  Sure, BL made a glib remark about chilling out but the typical white male comment that MW responded with did nothing to improve the situation, let alone defend anyones fight against oppressive or hurtful language.  To me, it’s discouraging that youre defending that sort of attitude at all. JT
     Wording matters.  Its not just that I dont like the term racist, its that its a very strong accusation that should be used with extreme care.  The last time an editor was accused of being a racist, everyone had a fit about it, but suddenly, its acceptable (as MW pointed out).  And what MW said  after two dismissive comments from BL  was Hmm... another white male who, exercising one of the many luxuries of his privilege, brushes off legitimate concerns. Hilarious.  She did not say typical white male.  Again, wording matters.   Users/CovertProfessor
        I would say that reply from M was fairly antagonistic.  There are no saints here, especially once it got personal. jw
         Somewhat antagonistic, yes, which in my view is understandable given the two immediately preceding brushoff comments from BL.  But antagonistic ≠ racist (I understand that you werent saying that they are the same, just trying to return to the point at hand  there is certainly a lot of antagonism to go around in this discussion and others).  cp
           Very true.  jw
        Hey CP, Ive actually tried to be pretty careful about using the term racist.  I agree, its a pretty strong word that implies fairly extreme bigotry, and I dont think Meggowaffle really exhibited that.  I checked through my edits and I dont think I ever called her a racist outright, (please correct me if I missed something though).  I think maybe the closest I got to calling her a racist was saying I called somebody out on a potentially racial or sexist comment.  I did say that MW stereotyped BL and made generalizations about BL based on race and gender, and I still think that is very accurate.  That said, if you want to split hairs on the typical white male comment, Ill give you that one.  Meggo didnt type the word typical in her initial comment to Brent, and its my fault for not going back to the original version and checking.  She did point out that BL was white and male, however, and in my opinion, she still made assumptions about BLs privilege and capacity for empathy.  I still believe it was stereotyping and generalizations based on race and gender, which was the main intent  of my last comment.  Hope that help clear things up a little.  JT
         Twice, on this very page, you agreed with BLs assertions.  BL said, But her tone is so dismissive of my opinion and my status that theres no question it was a racist statement and you said, Amen.  BL said, And so, all of the allegations of white privilege are not related to my actions at all.  They were assumptions made about my actions based on a profile.  A stereotype.  A prejudice.  I suppose that this is easier to swallow than the other alternative: that she is wrong.  Racism is always easier than the truth.  You said, I wholeheartedly agree with Brents message here.  So, perhaps you need to be more careful about which passages you say that you agree with.  By the way, today I came across something that I think we can all agree http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/04/06/459961/derbyshireavoidconcentrationsofblacks/?mobilenc is genuinely racist.  cp
          Cool, CP, if you want to split hairs again, sure you win.  Yes, Brent said those things, and I made statements supporting him.  If you really want to pin me down on his use of the word racist Ill agree again, I think its a little over the top.  At the same time, I was not the one being stereotyped here, and when I try to see it from his point of view, I can understand being pretty upset about the assumptions MW was making based on him being white and male.  To him, Im sure it feels like a racist statement, and I support his right to be upset about it.  Im choosing not to use the word racist myself, but I still support BL. JT
           Splitting hairs???  No, I am taking your statements at face value.  If you want to reinterpret them now, fine.  In fact, I am happy to hear you say that you dont think the word racist is appropriate for this context.  However, the fact remains that when BL first used that term, I was the only one who spoke up to defend MW against this charge (later, a couple of others did as well), whereas you and everyone else supported BL.  Again, this contrasts with the last such incident where everyone was outraged when the rword came out.  If you had a problem with the word, you should have said so, not said amen and I wholeheartedly agree.   Users/CovertProfessor
            Ok CP, I think this is getting blown out of proportion.  Im going to just stick to what I said before: Im personally not choosing to use the term racist, but I understand why Brent was upset enough to use it, and still support him.  JT
             Ok.  I see a difference, but not much of one, especially when you seem to be putting all of the blame on MW and none on BL.  cp
              Professor, youve spent your last few exchanges with me picking apart my comments and wordings now.  If you really want to start going into the details of whether or not I put all the blame on MW and none on BL, thats fine, but for now I think youre going to have to have the rest of that conversation without me.  You can go back through my edits on your own time and decide for yourself, as I dont think any response I give you on that is going to change your mind.  JT

20120419 13:13:58 nbsp Police officers can only be disciplined for stuff in their personnel files. There is no way in hell that the Kroll report will make it into those files... the police officers will fight tooth and nail to prevent that. The best we can hope for is that the internal affairs report reaches similar conclusions. As an aside, it is possible that the public will see part or all of the internal affairs report. They are generally considered confidential and exempt from public record act requests, but they can still be subpoenaed. You can bet the ACLU will try to get ahold of as much of the report as possible in their lawsuit against the university.  Users/WilliamLewis

20120419 13:43:59 nbsp I was basing my statement on the conclusion reached by the Atlantic in the article I linked to a few edits ago. So what happens to Lt. Pike? Once placed on administrative leave, he was subject to an internal affairs investigation. The law requires that its findings alone can bear on personnel actions, never mind all the useful evidence collected by the independent consultants, or the analysis performed by the panel of esteemed statesmen. I agree that public pressure generated by the report probably influenced Spicuzzas decision to resign, but I have my reservations about calling the independent investigation anything other than impotent in any official capacity. Given the resistance shown by UC Davis in fully cooperating with the independent review force, my suspicion was that they hoped it would be more of a smokescreen than anything else. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120419 14:01:04 nbsp After thinking it over, I suppose one could come to a less pessimistic conclusion than I did. But it seems to me, that, since both the internal and independent investigations were performed seemingly concurrently and without interaction, the independent one cannot be seen as having an affect on the other in even an unofficial sense. In the best case scenario, UC Davis was actually trying to get out as much truth as possible in the independent review, not because of possible disciplinary measures, but rather to put pressure on responsible parties to resign without the agonizingly long process that firing people apparently takes. So if that is your take on things, I wouldnt mind that being added as a possible interpretation. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120501 15:21:31 nbsp I think making a Wheelchair Accessibility page is a great idea. I also made the same assumption as you; spending a lot of time with a person in a wheelchair has been a real eyeopener. My friend has a giant ADA guidebook full of required sizes and dimensions for tables, and it can really be quite confusing. Unfortunately, you often cant tell if a table is accessible just by looking at it. For example, we rarely consider that most of us lean down slightly every time we take a bite. But my friend is paralyzed immediately from the arms down so unless he can get very close to the surface of the table, eating can be quite a chore. Central supports underneath the tables often block the ability to slide wheelchairs far enough under. Also, sometimes the surfaces themselves are too high.

In any case, I think it would be a good idea to start off with a page that simply lists businesses that make things hard on people with wheelchairs (tables too close together, not enough accessible seating, blocked wheelchair ramps,  awkward table surface heights, etc.), and then contrast those with a list of businesses that are unusually accommodating. That would be a good base, and from there we can try to hopefully research which places are actually out of compliance instead of simply inconvenient by citing relevant ADA documents.

20120510 18:25:34 nbsp Hey, CP (Im posting the same on Jabberwockys page). I just reviewed my intern’s recent edits, and saw your comments. I’ve spoken to him directly about his poor judgment in choosing a username.

While acknowledging that the username was inappropriate and mean, I hope that actions speak louder than words. I’m personally a huge supporter of Daviswiki – hell, I contributed $100 to the Localwiki campaign – and I’ve made it a point to put a lot of our info on Daviswiki, even when it doesn’t benefit our organization. A lot of organizations wouldn’t even bother to create a list of places you could use their product – they’d just have that on their website. And the easy thing for us to do would just be to make a plain text list on our page, but we’ve created about 15 of the businesses’ pages, and intend to create more. Sure, 15 is a small number, and it’s not as if we did a lot of journalism on those pages. I’m not trying to claim any medals. But I hope it shows a lot more commitment to the wiki than most businesses or individuals would make.

Also, may I note that one of our other interns used the username “davisrox”? That’s positive, right? (I’m being lighthearted, in case you can’t read the tone ). By the way, I’ve created instructions for all future team members to use their actual names.

I can’t read your tone, by the way – I’m not sure how serious you are when you’re talking about this username creating an impression about the entire organization. I understand that the people who represent an organization inevitably contribute to the organization’s perception, but as I said, I hope you can look past the words to the actions.

And if there are other things that I’ve missed that you think are problematic, or if things come up in the future…you know that you could always drop me a line? A quick “Hey, your intern’s username is kind of jerky” would be fine. One of the things I really like about the wiki is how much editors engage each other in conversation. One of the things that makes that username mean is that it’s an anonymous, unproductive criticism of Daviswiki, without trying to engage in any meaningful conversation. I’m trying to represent the opposite by engaging, with this post, and if you do the same and drop me a line in the future, it will make it easier for me to remedy anything that comes up.

  I realize I am a constant source of disappointment to you, SD, but I have given up trying to satisfy your whims.  In this case, the editor was creating a link to a nonexistent page and implying a user name that was in fact nonexistent, making it difficult for the less technicallysavvy to communicate with the editor directly.  There are other ways to indicate that one is a volunteer associated with the library, as I did on the page, hoping that the editor would follow suit.   Users/CovertProfessor
 I think what I meant to say was: Sounds to me like you could do some outreach. Im happy the people who constitute the library staff even bothered to respond to questions / start posting little updates about the house when I told them about the wiki and some patrons with a question. You could help said editor put the random hour change notices somewhere up top prominently, and explain the wiki conventions etc etc. I got them to show up on the wiki try not to chase them off when they make edits relevant to the community. I really dont think people are too confused... if they ask a question of library staff, they probably expect it on the page they left it on.

If you are not, then  given that you have gone out of your way to insult me and to deny otherwise  you should explain why you were making those edits to the page, edits that look like they are made by someone associated with the business.  You could also explain why you and Users/jimi mysteriously edit from the same IP addresses IP address, which you claim is from downtown Davis wifi hotspots.  Sorry, that is not credible that you and jimi just happen to be editing from the same hotspot.  Perhaps there is an explanation, but you have yet to offer it.  Users/CovertProfessor

20120611 11:54:32 nbsp The responses youve made towards JT on why a page shouldnt be deleted might go well here: Talk Pages/Active.  Though typing it out, I realize active was a bad choice.  My quick thought is its at least an organizational hub, or like a master to do list in things that were started but not finished?  It might also be a good centralized spot for other people to chime in whether a talk page should remain open or just be dismissed.  (ie, the Freshman Guide/Talk page.  Personally, I think this needs updating is no different than probably a good chunk of wiki content).  Users/EdWins

20120611 15:38:25 nbsp at this point Im just morbidly curious as to how Ed a relatively sharp adult in Grad school justifies to himself removal of my comments to another user... Users/StevenDaubert

20120612 17:28:21 nbsp Dons comment is not only inaccurate but completely inappropriate to the page. First off, the Chamber CREATED the DDBA in order to allow more focus for downtown issues. Secondly, how is he calculating retailers? For example, does he include restaurants? Thirdly, why are retailers a preferred category of business owners? Arent service providers like investment advisors, insurance agents, banks, credit unions, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, lawyers, doctors and dentists also important to note?

Point being, Dons narrow perspective is distracting and counterproductive to the point of this page... to educate Davis about what the Chamber of Commerce does, what it has done, who it represents and its place in the Davisuniverse. Users/KemblePope
 I actually found the figure interesting, and Id be very interested to learn more.  Without context  many of the things you mentioned here, Kemble  it could indeed be misleading.  But, in the usual style of the wiki, that says to me that more information, rather than less, would be the appropriate remedy.  Assuming the number of retailers is accurate, what percent of the downtown retailers is that?  Is it a different proportion than those in other industries?  If so, why?  If there is some problem related to retailers, getting some info on that would be really interesting. Users/TomGarberson

The Executive Director may wish to update the directory, or provide updated membership information.
Note (responding to comment below): the data above was compiled by adding up the members listed on the directory as of April 2012. It was in furtherance of a point I was making on the Vanguard that the Chamber does not have a strong retail membership, and that the retail members of the DDBA tend not to be members of the Chamber.

20120612 17:57:09 nbsp #1  I think that it is absolutely unfair and hurts the DavisWiki community that you can parade around here anonymously disparaging other peoples characters and hard work. I dont think that you should be allowed to post anonymously any more. I am not white washing. You, and others, however, are trying to intimidate me with spurious and copious amounts of opinion, facts with no primary source, and broad characterizations about how the community feels.

#2  The Davis Chamber of Commerce is a membership organization and thus our membership fluctuates monthly depending on whether existing members reinvest, go out of business, change locations or new members invest. Our database does not have a search function for downtown or nothing but retail (Cartridge World is in Office Machines/Supplies; Helmus Optometry which sells glasses is listed elsewhere and the list goes on and on) because those terms are meaningless for our purposes. Visitors come to us looking for reputable hotels, car repair, a good dentist or available meeting spaces. Our members look to other members for business to business services. I CAN NOT COMMIT TO REGULARLY COMBING THROUGH OUR DATABASES ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO PROVIDE STATISTICS THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE VALUE TO ANYONE, CAN YOU?

#3  If you are really interested in sharing WHO we are, then the answer is simple: http://web.davischamber.com/allcategories Users/KemblePope

Do you find yourself carefully parsing everything you write, when theres a time and/or place involved, before you post it to make sure you dont let too much slip?

Its an interesting process of compartmentalization.  I imagine its fairly similar to the mental process I go through, or other professionals in fields subject to legal privilege and privacy rights go through, when talking about a case.  Sometimes they can be interesting or instructive cases for a subject, but I find myself pausing every couple of sentences to run through what I want to say and double check that Im not going to divulge anything I shouldnt.

We only watched the first five minutes, but during that time I suddenly lunged for the remote, backed it up and exclaimed, Freaking A!  Its Rory!  IMDB does not list it, but if its not Arthur Darvill, its a dead ringer... and for the purposes of a evoking a character, thats enough.  Not sure well watch the whole thing, but its mentally jarring to see Rory doing BDSM porn between discussions of the social implications of a book. Users/JabberWokky

20121023 16:11:18 nbsp absolutely not I never said anything of that nature, I just said that Im not going to question/hold someones baggage (not to say rape is baggage) against them. If someone comes at me with a zany quasi rude request and Im a manager its my job to roll with the punches and move onto the next sale, not win a non argument or make a point out of the side of my mouth, especially if I had a corporate structure hanging over me.

Dont read too deeply into my musings, its just what popped into my head when I got done reading all four comments and I figured I would share, that way if said anonymous coward ever felt like coming back they wouldnt feel like everyone felt like they were in the wrong (notice how its hard to figure out of thompson is male or female based on the info provided?)

 Fair enough.  Still, if I am that Hispanic man/black woman/gay man/whatever and someone says that they dont want to deal with me only because of the group Im in, and Im in a group that is already a discriminated minority, I am going to have a hard time being polite about it, regardless of my job.   Users/CovertProfessor
very very true. I have two thoughts on the matter 1) I would expect a manager to grin and bear it, they have to manage people for a living... An hourly employee not so much. 2) after reading your comment this seems kinda applicable (in more ways than one), thanks 2pac http://www.youtube.com/watch?vxBAZfgMK5TQ Daubert

20121027 09:32:41 nbsp Thanks for the details about the wood burn regulations.  It is hard not to either mindlessly support something or attack a strawman  even with good intent  when all you have are vague outlines of what might be.  Empty vessels full of demons or angels. Users/JabberWokky

20121030 13:30:12 nbsp The important bit that I deleted was removed intentionally because it was misleading and inaccurate. The pepper spray Pike used is only controlled in California because of its size, not its content. You can buy the same spray with the same delivery mechanism as long as the canister is 2.5 oz or smaller. If you go north to Oregon, you can buy the exact same cans Pike used. Its more of a reflection of the weird laws we have in California than anything special about the spray. Also, suggesting that Pikes misuse of the spray was criminal is an unreasonable stretch. Civil liability? Yes. Criminal liability for battery? Perhaps. But his misuse is negligent at best, not criminal. Users/WilliamLewis
 If anything it falls (and did iirc) on the person who runs the dept. Even though Pike got a hold of and improperly deployed a weapons system he wasnt trained on or permitted to have as a professional(even with POST) isnt Criminal. Is it? Also I believe the main reason that the riot spray container is controlled (At a State level) is due to the pressure of the contents. If you discharge it on people < 6 feet away you can detach retinas or something b/c of the force and that is why they require more POST training to even be able to order it. Ignorance of the law is no excuse Daubert
 And if charges had been filed, we might have had a legal determination... now well never know, unless something similar happens elsewhere.  cp
  A legal determination of what? That his misuse (in the technical, not legal sense) of the pepper spray was criminal? The DA didnt even consider that question because its so ridiculous. They only considered whether or not the use of pepper spray (not how it was used) was criminal given the circumstances. The Reynoso report only considered his technical misuse of pepper spray because it demonstrated a failure in training that could be remedied. wl
   Ok, thats ridiculous is not an argument, but I dont really feel like debating a moot point.  Take the wording down if you want.  cp

20121122 15:26:26 nbsp Id guess that it isnt Roundup/sterile seed style GM crops.  Id guess there are options if youre looking.  That is, if I didnt make it clear, a few guesses.  However Google gives more info: http://bgoodscience.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/amishparadisetheuseofgmcropsbytheamish/ this article, plus some BBC video clips if you search for Amish GM crops.  Theres a certain cadence and rationale to the Amish that made sense after Id spent time with them as friends (nonpracticing members) and neighbors.  I do think they are widely misunderstood: they use modern medicine and use cell phones for emergencies, just not for casual use that might disconnect them from each other.  Its an interesting choice, more similar to the minimizing of possessions some people do than any kind of fear of technology.  Users/JabberWokky
