Lots of horror stories in these comments, but our experience was quite the opposite. Ive dined here a few times over the last decade or so and have always had a pleasant meal. Reccomended. Users/PaulThober

 From Wendy Weitzel, Facebook note 1/9/13: The Mustard Seed may soon change hands, but the upscale Davis restaurant should remain intact. Owners Robyn and Paul Bergman hope to retire this spring. Young Jai and Young Rin Kwon of Riverside are the buyers listed in the bulk sale, which includes all the furniture, menus, recipes and liquor license. Escrow is scheduled to close next month. Read more this Sunday in my column.  Wendy writes Comings and Goings for the Davis Enterprise. Users/DonShor
