2205 Haring, located at the far west end of Haring Hall is probably the least comfortable Campus Lecture Halls lecture hall on campus. Built when students were significantly smaller than they are now, the seats in Haring are far too small for the average student. Wise students will arrive early and get seats in the second to front row, granting themselves some leg room.


Amazingly, I always tend to fall asleep in there.  Users/RohiniJasavala Ro


Summer Advising 2004 was held in there.  It was so hard to complete the chemistry and precalculus diagnostic tests in those horrible seats.  Users/PatrickSing


If you dont like the smallness of the seats here, go find a seat at the ARC so you can stop being obese. Nyah!  Users/Yesitsme
