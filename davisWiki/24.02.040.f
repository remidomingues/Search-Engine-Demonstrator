20060602 08:50:50 nbsp the private or commercial operation of powered blowers will be limited between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. on Mondays through Fridays.  Most students dont wake up at 8AM.  My Casitas Apartments apartment complex starts blowing leaves at 8AM..argh. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060602 09:19:44 nbsp I was just looking for something like this...Our leaf blowers start early too....whats even worse is that currently there is construction going on right next to my effing window at The Lexington...and they start AT 7AM. I KNOW that stuff is louder than the decibel standards...I loathe them.  Users/KarlaFung

20071109 09:21:21 nbsp Can we please do something about banning leaf blowers in Davis? They pollute both soundwise and air qualitywise. I think it is the sort of thing that could pass around here. Why cant they just pick up a rake like a normal person. Users/ErikKlemetti

20080616 13:03:48 nbsp Be on the lookout: One specific violation they make is using more than one leaf blower at a time within 100foot radius at the same time! That not only makes things dustier, but noisier too, which then helps them exceed the 70 dB noise limit as well. Users/condemned2bfree

20080616 14:44:07 nbsp Maybe the city should require leaf blower users to get a permit.  The city could charge a healthy fee, make some money to help fill the deficit from those who feel they must leafblow instead of raking, and give the leaf blowers an incentive to stop their noise and air pollution.  The city commission is always going on about greenhouse gases.  Here is an opportunity for them to do something about them.  Leaf blowers cannot be justified.  They pollute and waste fuel to do something that does not require anything more than a broom or a rake.  Since the leaf blower lobby would likely claim an outright ban on leaf blowers would be an unconstituional taking why not make them pay for their polluting and wasteful ways. Users/aharjala
   Although Im not a huge fan of leaf blowers (especially on Wednesday mornings when they come to my apartment complex and make it impossible to sleep) Im sure they make professional landscapers and gardeners lives immensely easier than if workers had to use a broom or rake. If it takes them hours to rid the complex of leaves by leafblower, I cant imagine how long it would take to do it by rake, or the blisters it would cause. On the other hand, Im not sure why its necessary to clean up leaves every week, especially during the months when there arent that many leaves on the ground. In any case, I like the idea of charging a leafblower fee. http://www.nonoise.org/quietnet/cqs/other.htm West Hollywood and several other California cities have actually banned the use of leafblowers...  Users/ElleWeber

20090105 21:39:28 nbsp Its Monday night, 9:32, and there are 2 leaf blowers next to my apartment complex downtown. You can hear them all over downtown from 7AM to 9PM pretty much every day. Im more than willing to go like WeHo and ban them altogether. I will be contacting my city Representative this week and Ill report back.

Having done landscaping work myself, I sympathize with the landscaping community 100% on this  raking isnt easy work. However, the continuous noise and dust have become worse than having some leaves on the ground.   Users/sjoe

Update: My email to a Mr. Heystek, Lamar was not returned. Ill try the next one on the list.

20090106 11:36:21 nbsp I had similar problems to those listed here. After reading the regulations, I noticed two things the company conducting the leaf blowing was doing that were in violation. First, they used three leaf blowers at a time (when only one is allowed), and they were starting earlier than allowed. I called Pat Riley of the City Parks Dept. and he was immensely helpful. Dont be afraid to call him if you notice an infraction. Do not call him just to complain about how much you hate leaf blowers. His number is 7575656. Users/condemned2bfree

20140816 08:20:19 nbsp Looks like the noise code against leaf blowing has been weakened since 2005. They can start at 8am on Saturdays now. Users/ToddKaiser
