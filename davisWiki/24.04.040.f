Community Parks parks are exempt from this paragraph (5); or

 (6)The applicant or location has had previous violations within the past calendar year, and in the judgment of the police chief, issuance would be contrary to the intent of section 24.04.010.

 (1)The volumes, patterns and speed of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the proposed area of use;

 (2)The relationship of the proposed use of equipment and potential impacts upon the traffic patterns;
