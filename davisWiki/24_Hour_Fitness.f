24 Hour Fitness is a chain gym. They offer weight equipment and classes, almost 24 hours a day/night. You can sign up for spinning (cycling) classes 30 minutes before the class start time.  (At the 24 Hour Fitness in Sacramentos Downtown Plaza, you can sign up for all classes one hour before the class start time.) 24 Hour Fitness is expected to close October 31, 2006; Davis memberships and most equipment will be transferred to Davis Swim and Fitness Club.

I cant say enough about how poorly I rate 24 Hour Fitness. The first time I went in, I was shopping around for a new Davis gym and just wanted to check out their facilities and prices; it was 10pm and the person at the front counter couldnt/wouldnt give me a price and instead told me I had to come back during regular hours to speak with a counselor. She did let me wander through the facility on a selfguided tour though, and I was surprised to find it pretty crowded at that time of night and downright stanky! No air movement... just thick sweaty air like in a high school locker room. The facilities include a lap pool and sauna, but the lap pool is in a small, even sweatier room and who needs to sit in a sauna when youve already waded through the outer sauna where stairmasters and ellipticals are packed armtoarm with only three feet of airspace between you and two more rows? This wasnt my only visit to this particular 24 Hour though, because in 2004 I signed up, desperate for a cheap short term gym in preparation for an expedition. I went to that stinky hole for three months straight around 11pm each night and it was still nasty!! Users/AlphaDog

20050716 14:23:59 nbsp I cant respect any place that calls themselves 24 Hour Whatever and not open for 24 hours. Users/DatNguyen

20050815 15:55:12 nbsp Do not, whatever you do, become a member of this gym. They are not open 24 hours, they do not have enough parking for their patrons (the spaces in the lot are striped too narrow for cars to actually fit in them), the machines are old and poorly maintained, and its Godawfully crowded. Moreover, they like to screw you out of your money, as they require 30 business days to cancel your membership, not just 30 days like the charming folks behind the counter told me. I feel very, very cheated, and this gym was never worth being a member of in the first place. Oh, and its always hotter than hell in there. Please, save yourself some anxiety and money, and dont patronize this gym. Users/JoannaHeiple

20050915 12:19:23 nbsp I never became a member of 24 Hour because when I was figuring out whether to go here or somewhere else, the employee who took me on a tour lied to me and told me not to go to California Family Fitness (a group of gyms in Sacramento) because CalFit was going to be bought out soon by 24Hour.  That was a bold lie (a quick call to CalFits biz office confirmed it was untrue, and this was 2 years ago) and they lost my business as a result.  I went to CalFit, and couldnt be happier.

20060219 15:38:54 nbsp Yes I agree with all the other BAD reviews of this place. But since I have a membership to any 24hourfitness club I really have no other choice. Equipment is OLD and its a bit stinky there but I dont think they care to upgrade since its not a club with much traffic anyway. There are much better alternatives for people who use Davis only facilities like the ARC, Davis Sports Club etc. Stay away if you can! Users/LookyLoo

20060325 19:38:55 nbsp Management sucks. Point out a problem with their equipment, they dont care, never let you know whether its fixed or not. And then get in your face and act like theyre your buddy. Recently, one of their managers unmercilessly flirted with me while I was working out (and I wasnt interested). Im glad he moved to another location.  Oh yeah, management sucks.  If you want anything done, stay away from the Operations manager and the short guy with dark hair. Ask the nice staff.

20060704 15:41:31 nbsp Has anybody heard rumors about the club closing down around September?  Ive heard that their lease is not going to be renewed and they have to make changes to restore the space the way it was before they moved in.  Since they do require 30 days cancellation, Im concerned that theyll just one day be closed but still bill for the last month. Users/MikeCarr

20060920 09:04:29 nbsp They are closing on Oct 31st. Users/AmandaCaudle

20061101 14:14:38 nbsp Do not bother joining this gym.  As of October 31st, they have moved out of Davis and will most likely not be renewing any Davis contracts soon.  If you are a 24 Hour member, you will need to go to locations in Sacramento, as there are no locations in Dixon, Woodland, Vacaville, Winters or Fairfield.  I am also mad that they did not send notification to members, they only posted signs on the gym doors.  If you did not initially join at the Davis location, you could not transfer your membership to the closest gym.  I renewed my contract in July, and if I had known about this, I would have saved my money and used it to go to another club with better classes and that is open earlier in the day.  I also agree, if the gym name is 24 HOUR, it should be open 24 HOURS a day.   Users/TracyChilders

20061102 22:16:18 nbsp I was a member of this gym, and remain a member of the national chain. Ive read a lot of the complaints on this page and find them to be mostly unjustified. 24 Hour Fitness mailed me and everyone I know who attends this gym to inform them of the closing. They had a booth setup for TWO WEEKS explaining the transition. Members could choose to transfer to Davis Swim and Fitness or keep their 24 Hour membership at the other facilities. And as for their hours, they had the BEST hours of any gym in Davis. The few times that they were closed (Sat, Sun, Mon early AM only), you could use the other 24 Hour facilities. The facility was larger than any other private gym in Davis that Im aware of, kept better hours, and was better stocked with merchandise than others. Ill keep my 24 Hour membership. If you prefer the SMALL Davis gyms with poor hours or the insanely crowded ARC, then thats your choice.
