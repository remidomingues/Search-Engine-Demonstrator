20060528 20:06:58 nbsp When I first read this I thought felt tip marker refererred to things like normal Sharpies.  The definition here is for onehalf inch or greater width at the tip.  Thats a pretty fat felt tip marker.  Who sells markers with tips that big?  What do people use a marker with a tip that large for?  By tip I assume we mean the actual felt region of the marker.  Its pretty easy to graffiti up something with a standardsize Sharpie as well.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
