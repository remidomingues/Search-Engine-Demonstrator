Davis Municipal Code Davis Municipal Code/26 Chapter 26
 OFFENSES  MISCELLANEOUS 
  26.01.010 Annoying persons on streets, etc. 


No person shall in any public place be guilty of conduct annoying to persons passing or being upon the streets or public grounds or upon adjacent premises. (Code 1964, ยง 78.106.)

Update: This code section was http://cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p26&q1027 Repealed by 2357.  Annoying people everywhere rejoiced, and the last remnants of civility fled the City of Davis.  The code section has been memorialized by a touching /Eulogy eulogy.

20100201 23:49:33 nbsp This code section is actually downright unconstitutional, as it parallels almost exactly an ordinance turned over by the Supreme Court in http://supreme.justia.com/us/402/611/case.html Coates v. Cincinnati.  You dont have standing to challenge it unless its applied against you, though, and I doubt any Davis officers are going to be enforcing it.  So, it may well float on in Daviss Municipal Code as an ode to hilarity for all eternity! Users/TomGarberson
  Any chance of tracking down the author and people who voted that into place and charging them with malpractice? Users/JasonAller
   Haha not really, no.  But if you ask me, its a pretty amusing law to have on the books, so long as they dont try to enforce it against anyone.  That vaguely totalitarian flavor is so out of character with Davis, but because its so quirky, it seems to fit right in. tg

20100408 18:28:58 nbsp It seems that many people are misreading this as though a person can be guilty of being annoying rather than what this says where no person shall ... be guilty. Users/E.C.H.
  Youre correct that its facially somewhat ambiguous.  Contextually, however, it isnt: conduct annoying to persons... isnt illegal absent this section, so theres nothing of which people can be guilty without the code.  Plus, if you have a look at http://cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/chapter.cfm?chapter26 Municipal Code Chapter 26, youll note that this section, Annoying persons on streets, etc., is one of the specifically enumerated OffensesMiscellaneous of Chapter 26.
