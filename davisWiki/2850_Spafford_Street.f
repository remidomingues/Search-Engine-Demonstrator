Address(2850 Spafford Street) is home to JRP Historical Consulting.

Until 2010, it was home to:
  California Center for Public Health Advocacy
  Steves Place, Inc.
  John Meyer & Associates, Inc.

Steves had a delivery dock, offices, walk in freezer and an industrial kitchen for making pizza dough in the downstairs. A battered 25ft tape measure was also left deep in a crawl space between the upstairs and downstairs by an unknown person, until it was rescued by Users/NickSchmalenberger.
