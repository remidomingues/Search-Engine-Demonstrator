2 Wellman is a moderately sized Campus Lecture Halls lecture hall in the basement of Wellman Hall. Like most classrooms on the UCD campus, Wellman 2 is equipped with a DVD player and LCD projector, and because Wellman is often left unlocked, this makes Wellman a prime renegade Movies movie theater. Grab a DVD, some friends s(begin)and some beerss(end) and head over to Wellman.

Especially important for renegadge Movies movies: If Wellman is locked and you need to get in, waiting outside of Kerr Hall Kerr for a few minutes for a graduate student to go inside will allow you into Kerr Hall Kerr.  Once youre in Kerr, you can always get into Wellman Hall Wellman by going down the stairs to the lowest level and following that little tunnel. It leads right to Wellman Hall Wellman.
