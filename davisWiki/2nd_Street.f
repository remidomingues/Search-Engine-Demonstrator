2nd Street can be a really confusing Streets street.  From the west it starts on A street (at the University Farm Gate), continuing eastward through downtown until it dead ends at the train station. To pick it up again, you need to go north on H Street, hang a right on 3rd Street, and make a right on L Street.  After a few hundred feet, L street bends to the left at the L and 2nd Garden  this bend is the eastward continuation of 2nd Street.  A short section exists as an access road along the train tracks from J St. almost all the way to L St.

At the East end of town (Mace Boulevard/County Road 104) 2nd Street turns into County Road 32A and extends as far east as the Yolo Bypass Channel.  At County Road 105 it crosses the Railroad Tracks and a little further east it transitions from a worn out asphalt county road to the wellengineered concrete roadway of Lincoln Highway Old US 40.

2nd Street was formerly known as 1st Street.

During the fall of 2010 and spring 2011, 2nd Street from C St. to F St. is getting some http://www.davisvoice.com/2010/07/2ndstdowntowntogetsomelove/ modern enhancements.  This will include painting of Sharrows  shared use lane markings (aka sharrows).
