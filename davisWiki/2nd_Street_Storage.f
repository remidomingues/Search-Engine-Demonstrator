History


The large building used to be the home of B&B Wood Products (a sawmill).


Stuff!  If you got too much and you want to keep it, you need one of the storage units in Davis!

There was a misscommunication over exactly what the price was and the terms, but I assume that is partially due to me renting a few days after they opened.  They refunded the overcharge, which is all that matters in my book.  Everyone makes mistakes, but not everyone fixes them!
