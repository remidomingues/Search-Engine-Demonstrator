Is the slang name for the 3 concrete tunnels that are ~3 feet wide each and they traverse from East to West. From the Hunt Wesson Plant to the F street drainage ditch. It is near what was popular hangout for the Homeless transient population of Davis. There is a path that starts near the Davis Little League complex little league field, follow the tracks like you were headed to Woodland for ~100 yards starting at overpass.

If you one enter them from the West which is the only way to do so without trespassing after ~50 feet the drop for I believe 3  9 feet.  Users/StevenDaubert STDaubert

  Probably the point where I clicked Save Changes besides I just wanted it to be on the wiki cause a) I needed the entry so I could submit it to Mystery Picture mystery photo, and b) Joggers run past this and some Davisites know of it.  Users/StevenDaubert
