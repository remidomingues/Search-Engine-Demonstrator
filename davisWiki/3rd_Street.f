3rd Streets Street takes a brief eastward journey through central Davis, beginning at A Street which borders the UC Davis campus, and terminating at L Street.  Thats it! A brief 12block sojourn on the grid. If youre on a bike, Campuss North Quad Avenue runs right into 3rd St. With the streets many stop signs and direct connection to campus, it has become a hot spot for bike traps.
When youre done, stop by Navigating Davis to see whats on some of our other streets and where they may lead you.

Third Street was renovated, between D and F streets, from the first week of July 2006 until the end of September 2006.http://www.city.davis.ca.us/ed/projects/view.cfm?project2F12FE1CF70F4D5C9A6523E11D935C88 More
