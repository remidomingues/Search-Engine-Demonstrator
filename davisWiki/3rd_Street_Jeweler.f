20070424 16:45:40 nbsp Apparently this place is locally owned by a really great guy. My exboyfriend was searching high and low for a ring with a mouse on it after I lost one I found at the whole earth festival, and everywhere he went jewlers wanted to make him a new one with a mold or put a charm on a band  all of which would have cost a lot of money. He finally stopped by 3rd Street Jewlers and the owner worked with him to make me the cutest mouse ring, without charging an arm and a leg and being quite creative!  Users/ChristyMarsden

20071022 23:45:01 nbsp My wife and I visited place while looking for wedding bands.  Frank, the owner, gave us the frank lowdown on the different metals and gave an overall impression of honesty.  We left happy, knowing we werent ripped off.  I would totally go back, heck, even just to say hi to Frank.  I dont know whats up with all the musical clocks, though.  Maybe theyre a niche market.  This is the first time Ive written on the wiki about anything, and Im doing it because I want to make sure this place gets the reputation it deserves.  Its _SO_ much better that the place with the Nambe stuffthey were real stuffy and stuck up to us. Users/bartbart

20071212 00:29:04 nbsp Frank and his crew are very nice.
He sent my watch to his watchmaker, but the watchmaker couldnt fix it (very complicated movement), so he returned it to me without any chargers. Despite that it cost him in shipping and handling. Users/TT

20080112 23:59:43 nbsp Frank is very helpful, and willing to go the extra mile to help.  I went there shopping for an engagement ring, and he sat me down and gave me a very helpful lesson on diamonds.  I gave him a price range and he ordered several diamonds for me to look at and let me know the very day they arrived.  He got me an excellent deal on a very nice diamond that was right in my price range.  In contrast, when I inquired at DeLuna about a diamond, they took my phone number and said they would contact me.  When they did, the diamonds they showed me were all higher then my price range, and less of a deal then those at 3rd Street Jeweler.  So I got the engagement ring at 3rd Street Jeweler, and both I and my fiance are very pleased with it.  We will definitely go back there to get our wedding rings. Users/DJUltomega

20080118 15:29:18 nbsp I requested a quote for my wifes anniversary ring, and it took a very long time to receive a call back.  The price was also significantly higher than the quote that I received from DJs in Woodland (who we ended up going to and they were great) for the exact same yellow gold ring with a diamond in the middle.  I wouldnt go back there, mostly because I didnt find this place to be anything special.  The owner also seemed a little shady. Users/DavisMan56

20080120 00:35:01 nbsp Beware of this place!  I took my great grandfathers watch in for repairs, and the owner somehow lost it.  He didnt seem bothered at all by his mistake, and offered a single digit settlement for my loss because the watch was not worth much in his opinion.  This watch has been in my family for generations, and was absolutely priceless to us, which I made very clear when I dropped it off at this store.  I was absolutely horrified by his negligence, and will never go back there.  I also have a colleague who had a difficult time with an order that she placed there.  Be careful! Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080202 16:01:10 nbsp I didnt have an experience as horrible as Dr. Lindsays above, but I just wasnt happy with the selection. Ill be honest, Im a big fan of DeLunas, but I still thought acrosstown rivalry would be good. This place just didnt do it for me though. Users/dlacy

20080214 01:16:10 nbsp I cant imagine some of the problems other people claim to have had. I have purchased from Frank for as long as Ive been with my wife  for nearly five years hes never steered me wrong. He custom made me a beautiful heartshaped platinum and diamond ring which I proposed with, and we have since purchased a set of diamond studs, two more rings and a custom wedding band from him. The most refreshing part about working with Frank is that I go in expecting to get a good deal, and I always do. Users/inarius

20080330 20:30:50 nbsp Frank and co worked hard to deliver a product that met our exacting specifications. He went above and beyond, and took the time to fully answer all of out questions. Users/BrianNeal

20080528 17:51:14 nbsp Great service: patient, friendly, and good at helping to keep things within a budget.  Frank went out of his way to research a specific stone I wanted and to explain the options.  Users/RebeccaGarabed

20080622 15:59:36 nbsp I just wanted to say that I love buying from Frank because he is an honest man who gives great prices on expensive jewelery. He also values my repeat business so much that he let me use one of his pieces for my wedding. My something borrowed was a beautiful saltwater pearl necklace with a diamond pendant. When planning a wedding, its so hard to find a person whos not trying to take you for everything youre worth. Users/Adrianna

20080624 13:58:21 nbsp I went in to look at rings one Saturday, and even though it was close to closing time Frank gave me his full attention.  A few weeks later I went in again with my mother to show her what I had picked out, and Frank was very attentive (I still hadnt bought anything yet).  Better still, he offered to clean my mothers wedding band and engagement ring for free while we waited.  It was quick, and her jewelry looks better than it has in twenty years.  Frank rocks! Users/SugarPlum

20080823 11:02:39 nbsp I went by for a very small purchase (watchband), arriving about half an hour before the posted opening time.  Frank let me in early and was as helpful with my purchase as Id have expected if I were buying something much more expensive.  Ill certainly remember that if I am in the market for jewelry in the future... Users/DataPoint

20080930 11:08:44 nbsp My fiancee and I wanted to support a local store instead of sending money elsewhere to an internet store.  We visited a number of stores in Sacramento and Davis before settling on 3rd Street. Frank is the main reason. He is very patient, and he doesnt leave you as many others do with the feeling that he is trying to push something on you to close a deal.  Franks instore engagement ring inventory is modest, but if he doesnt have what you want, he will show you catalogs and can order almost anything. As another wiki user said, he is also good at staying within a specified budget. Users/UCDPhD

20081101 14:27:58 nbsp I bought a beautiful gift for my sister here. Frank, the owner was very nice. The staff wrapped the gift and cleaned my wedding set while I waited. Users/StaceyBlosch

20081114 14:37:08 nbsp They are a very good store with excellent Customer Service. We needed a watch repaired, and one of the personnel worked on it immediately. When we were wondering about how much it would be, the man said To not worry about it, and that He had time. and  did the repair for free. Very nice, and showed us the problem and fixed it while we waited. Their staff are friendly and helpful. Id definitely go back to them if I was in the market for a watch.  Users/Joker8Baller

20081115 02:40:47 nbsp This is the place to go to for watches, rings, or any other jewelery needs.  The owner Frank Acosta is downtoearth and honest, traits typically lost among jewelers.  His prices are unbeatable, and in my case he did minor work for free (whereas other jewelers could have gouged upwards of $20).  I have never posted on wiki before and am only posting now because his shop is that great.  Dont even bother going anywhere else. Users/erik.

20081118 12:22:19 nbsp Frank is the real deal.  He is patient and understanding, and the environment is classy yet welcoming (unlike DeLunas where the boredlooking staff wouldnt give me the time of day when I came in wearing jeans and sneakers).  We bought our wedding bands from Frank and were very pleased with the great customer service and reasonable prices.  He engraved them for free, and he also did a nice job resetting an heirloom diamond. Users/SugarPlum

20081221 13:22:43 nbsp I was dreading the process of buying jewelry, but I had a really good experience here.  They helped me find something I really liked at a price I was happy with.  Frank knows his stuff, and I found him and his staff better informed and friendlier than other places I went to.  In addition, he had better prices on what appeared to be similar stuff from DeLuna.  Hopefully I wont need to use it, but he offers a great guarantee and refund policy.   Users/icefisher

20090228 22:09:57 nbsp Theres alot to say about Franks. I guess the first thing I would say is that Franks is MOST DEFINATELY the BEST place to buy jewelry. Frank operates his business with the idea that the costumer comes first. To the employees of 3rd Street Jewelers, costumer satisfaction is key; even if you walk out ouf the store empty handed, Frank and his employees want to walk out with a great expreience, in the least. Also, you can always find something to fit your budget, and if what you want isnt in the store then you can sit down and pick it out of a one of the numerous cataloges and order it.... I have to say that my multiple experiences at Franks are much, much better than my one experience at DeLunas.
The best advice that I could give any costumer is walk into Franks with a smile because if you dont, the employees just have to work a little harder at putting one on your face (but they are great at it!!). Always drop by 3rd street Jewelers, no matter the occasion, because you will always find a friendly, patient staff who help you find what you are looking for.  Users/kcwayne

20090306 14:52:21 nbsp I recently went shopping here for a locket and had a good experience.  I have never been shopping for a quality piece of jewelry before, and the staff was attentive and patiently answered all of my questions even though I was only looking at midrange pieces (nothing terribly expensive).  They didn’t have a great selection of lockets at the time, but they let me look through a number of catalogues and offered to special order a few for me to look at.  They offered to do this at no charge, and promised there would not be an obligation to buy if I didn’t like the pieces when they arrived.  Luckily, one of the lockets I picked out was perfect.  The other locket I wanted to look at did not arrive on time, and Frank included a nice silver chain for free with the locket for my “inconvenience” even though I assured I was happy with the locket that did arrive.  While another shop I went to had a better selection of lockets in stock, both stores showed me the same catalogues and can pretty much acquire the same pieces.  When I mentioned I had been to a different shop, the staff informed me that they try to beat local prices.  Overall, I had a great experience shopping here. Users/J.Thomas

20090408 13:28:28 nbsp While the selection might not be as wide as some stores outside of Davis, I was happy to make a purchase with Frank.  Customer service oriented, onsite work done on most all items, fairpricing and a casual shopping experience all made my first visit here a good one.   He will get a shot at my business the next time Im looking to buy jewelery.   Users/loneshark

20090511 16:06:00 nbsp Frank is the bomb. I came in to purchase a mothers ring a year ago. He showed me a number of pieces including some in a catalog and quoted me prices. At the time we werent comfortable spending a lot of money and I still wasnt excited about what we were looking at. Through out the year I would stop in to say hi and see if he had anything new to look at. He would always happily greet me by name and always with a big smile! He never once pushed me or made me feel like I was wasting his time. This past month my husband and I came in to look at rings again. Frank showed us some new items that he had in silver (less expensive than we looked at before but more affordable and contemporary). I immediately loved and purchased a pair of earrings and ring that he suggested setting our kids birth stones in. The work ended up being a lot more effort than he thought; he actually had to have the ring handmade (recasted). It took a bit longer to make but in the end it was beautiful and exactly what I wanted. Frank went the extra mile for me and I will never go anywhere else!
Users/debwestergaard

20090721 07:47:16 nbsp Frank is really friendly and helped me find a nice silver chain necklace for a gift.
Hes very kind to the customers and loves to talk to them great customer service.
As for silver necklaces, I thought the prices were fair. Users/thisisht

20090806 16:46:42 nbsp Recently I had some links removed from a very expensive watch I received as a college grad present at a local watch place. About a month later the watch fell apart! I looked up jewelers in Davis as I didnt want to go back to that other place and came across 3rd Street Jewelers. I went in and explained the situation to who I think was the owner Frank. He took one look at the watch and saw what they had done wrong right away. He took it to his workstation and within minutes fixed my watch! Heres the best part, I asked him how much I owed him and he said NOTHING! This is the kind of customer service I wish I encountered everywhere; he was so friendly. I HIGHLY recommend 3rd Street Jewelers to anyone with watch repair related needs. I browsed around for a minute too and he had some very nice jewelry and even art for sale.  Users/drakeboy

20100405 10:15:50 nbsp Im afraid I had an absolutely horrible experience here. I took a ring in for repair that I have owned for 20 years. It was just a silver and opal ring, not worth much to anyone else but it ment the world to me. When I went in I was impressed with how friendly Frank was and he seemed to understand how much the ring ment to me. But when I went in to pick it up I discovered that while heating the ring up to replace the band the opal was burned up as well as most of the design had been melted off the sides. Frank was not nice about the mistake. I really didnt do anything but stand at his counter and cry and he started to yell at me that it was my fault for not telling him it was an opal (but shouldnt a jeweler know an opal?). And he had replaced the opal with some moonstone piece of glass that was not set well. When I asked about the design on the side (it had been melted off and then very poorly reetched/scratched in) he said that nothing had happened to the design and I was making things up. Honestly, do you think Im an idiot that I cant see when a design has been scratched in? He got really angry and upset at me (and surprisingly I was so saddened by the loss of the ring I never even yelled back at him..just cried) that he finally yelled Well what do you want me to do about it?!?! So I asked him to return the ring back to the way it was as much as possible and I wasnt going to pay for it. He said fine but I had to never come into the store again!!! (as if I would...) When I returned almost 3 weeks later for my ring he had replaced the moonstone with a crap opal and tried to touchup the bad etchings on the sides. I said fine and took it, I just wanted my ring back. The opal cracked in the first 3 days I had the ring and the replacement shank (the reason I took it in was to have the bottom of the ring thickened because it had cracked) is actually bigger than the rest of the ring...all in all the ring is ruined. But because its not worth much in the real world there isnt anything I can do about it. Frank ruined a ring that Ive worn for 20 years, and whats worse is he didnt care and because he felt defensive he took his mistake out on me.  Users/mra

20100410 07:39:19 nbsp I ride past this place every time I go to the thrift store. Yesterday I bought a (non functioning) Fossil watch from the Thrift Store for $3. I immediately went across the street to see if they could fix it here. Just as I expected, all it needed was a battery replacement ($10) Everyone was really friendly and the service was very fast! I would definitely recommend this place! Users/lauraAsmith

20100429 14:37:23 nbsp Fast friendly service.  They fixed the shoddy job that the guy next to Bistro 33 did for five bucks.  I highly recommend this place. Users/kohutw

20100520 14:25:41 nbsp Frank is really nice and so is his mother..Sometimes she works there. He always gives my bf good pricing and is always there to help when we stop by!!! Strongly recommend!! Users/cherryr

20100624 10:20:43 nbsp Excellent service and pricing.  And best of all, honest.  Unlike the dude next to Bistro 33.

Frank is a gem.  I highly recommend this place. Users/browneyedblues

20100721 00:21:58 nbsp I went in to replace the batteries for a couple of watches.  I chose this place primarily due to the positive comments here on the wiki.  The owner took the watches and immediately went to work on them (no waiting).  He brought both back in about five minutes.  He replaced the battery in one watch ($10) and informed me that my other watch simply had a battery that wasnt seated properly.  He fixed it and charged me nothing, whereas he easily couldve made an extra $10 by selling me an unnecessary battery.  I appreciate the honesty and will shop here again. Users/willwallace

20100805 11:26:31 nbsp I have been buying jewelry from Frank for about 15 years. He is a good man and extremely kind hearted. The bad experiences Im sure while unpleasant do not present all the aspects of what happened. However, we all have our days when life contributes to our ability to cope. I know that when I faced hardship and could not meet my financial obligations Frank reassured me and although I felt ashamed of my situation he never made me feel like an account but a friend.  Users/MarthaFabela

20100920 14:34:26 nbsp Great place to go. Very honest and they are very quick on their response times. I took a ring in and it was done a few hours later. I also took a necklace there and it was done a day ahead of when they originally told me. Users/LeahW

20101209 16:56:57 nbsp I had a great experience with Frank today. I was trying to pick out something for my girlfriend for Christmas, and had previously stopped by a different jeweler in Davis. Frank helped me pick out a really nice pair of earrings, and because I told him the max I wanted to spend up front, he brought the price down to what was in my range without me asking. Great service, not too pushy, and a nice guy. Definitely would come here again Users/LoooongBusRide

20110129 15:17:07 nbsp I would definitely hesitate to come here.  I recently brought my watch in to have its battery replaced.  A few minutes later the person working on it came over and said that one of the pieces was missing (the little part on the side that you use to change the time...).  It was definitely not missing when I brought it in.  They said they would have the owner look at it.  We left to run some errands.  When we came back the owner said it was broken.  We asked what they could do about it because it was not broken when we brought it to them.  The owner immediately became belligerent, accused us of falsely accusing him; treated us very rudely, and refused to do anything about it.  He told us that it would cost $70 to repair, and basically accused us of trying to get him to fix it for free.  The very friendly man at Davis Awards and Watchworks offered to make the repair for $30, so there is obviously the owner was being not just bellicose, but dishonest also.

I will certainly never be going back.  It seems many people have had success here, so if everything goes well, Im sure its fine and dandy, but if anything goes wrong, be prepared to be treated extremely rudely and not to have anything done about your watch that they have just broken. Users/SMan

20110702 00:59:40 nbsp I met Frank today, he was a really easygoing guy. Chopped it up with him for a little bit while I was in the shop. He resized my watch bracelet at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended. If you need your watch repaired for any reason, come see Frank. Dont believe these poor watch repair reviews. Frank and I, as WISs, (look it up if you dont know what it means) know our stuff about watches. He will take care of you. Users/GrantLim

20120223 13:49:56 nbsp Excellent customer service here. My husband and I bought our wedding rings here and Frank and all his staff were very helpful and approachable. We really appreciated that folks wanted to make sure that we were getting what we wanted and not just trying to sell us the most expensive stuff. Frank also custommade some simple matching necklace and earring sets for my bridesmaids gifts when I couldnt find what I was looking for in the store. When my husbands titanium ring ended up being a bit looser than anticipated (a couple of weeks after the wedding), Frank got him a different size, included the original engraving, and only charged him the cost of shipping. Overall a great experience.  Users/Nerissa

20120313 20:15:05 nbsp Went in here today to pick up a ring I had to have fixed (was flattened), and my grandpas airborne wings and unit ring for WWII that I had cleaned. Not only was it done ahead of the estimate, but even though it was only a $25 dollar job the staff treated me and the task like a $2,500 job. Great service, the wings and unit ring probably looked better than when they were first made and the flattened ring was once again round. Great experience.
 Users/patrick82

20120520 13:01:31 nbsp I dont normally take the time to leave feedback on this website, but Ive been consistently impressed by this business. I originally came in here to get my fiancees engagement ring cleaned before I proposed. They provided the service for free. Later I came in here browsing for my own (mens) wedding band, after shopping online and going to DeLuna downtown (way overpriced!). 3rdstreet Jeweler was extremely friendly and professional, but without being snobby or overly imposing. I ended up with an incredibly affordable twotone titanium and 14k yellow gold ring for less than $200, and they gave me an complementary engraving as well. Theyve got a great selection, nice range of prices, and ideal customer service. Highly recommend. Users/JamesColligan

20121010 12:18:25 nbsp If you value your valuables, do NOT have them serviced here.  As mra did (20100405), I had a terrible experience.  Frank dented and abraded a custom wedding band during soldering.  Potential patrons should consider the fact that 1) he did not notice his mistakes before returning the ring to me (a sign of carelessness and lack of concern) and 2) he denied damaging my ring after explaining to me exactly how hed damaged it.   While he did attempt to buff out his mistakes, he took no responsibility, made no compensatory or conciliatory gestures and was incredibly condescending and defensive.  As SMan said (20110129) if anything goes wrong, be prepared to be treated extremely rudely and not to have anything done about your watch or ring that they have just broken or damaged. Users/nfl

20130428 10:34:53 nbsp MISLEADING!!! I have an issue with a business that puts on their sign Since 1988 when clearly, it says on this site Established 2007! I dont get it... Anyways, took my Michael Kors watch that my BF gave me for my bday for an adjustment, they were rude (maybe because the watch wasnt purchased there), there were nicks on my links!! Gonna take my watches to Davis Watch
works next time!!  Users/EmmyThill

20130702 23:16:25 nbsp  Ive known Frank for a long time. He has helped my husband and me create beautiful jewelry starting with my engagement ring. Many years later, I still go to Frank for all my jewelry needs. He is an honest person who cares about making his customers happy!  Users/JChapman

20130710 15:15:45 nbsp Watch batteries (with the service of installing them) are still $10@. I thought Id call ahead, let him no there werent any repairs needed, and he said he wasnt busy. When I came by an hour later, someone had come in to design a wedding ring  well, I had no problem with just dropping my watches off in that circumstance. I got a call back when they were ready. My experience was good. Users/DougWalter
