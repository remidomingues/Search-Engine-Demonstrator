There’s a youth development organization in your community that helps young people gain citizenship, leadership, and life skills . . .

It’s called 4H. The four Hs stand for: Head, Heart, Hands, and Health

The http://www.ca4h.org 4H Youth Development Program is in every county in California. You will recognize 4H by its green clover. What you may not know is that 4H is for everybody, for all young people in California, whether they’re in small towns, big cities, or anything in between. Today, 4H is 130,000 young people learning, achieving, and giving back to their communities, supported by 20,000 caring and enthusiastic adult volunteers.

4H is a place where young people are given many opportunities to build confidence, learn responsibility, and develop skills that will last them a lifetime. It’s a place where youth make friends and share interests, ranging from building robots to raising rabbits, from designing web pages to landscape design. It’s a place where youth work together to make a positive difference in their community, and adult volunteers make a powerful difference in the lives of young people. Get involved in the 4H community and make a lasting difference!

LEARNING TOGETHER . . .
The 4H Youth Development Program is open to all youth, ages 9 –19. In some counties, additional programs for “primary” members allow youth to join 4H beginning at age 5!

BUILDING IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS . . .
With a youth to adult volunteer ratio of 6:1, young people have the opportunity to develop a strong, positive relationship with a caring adult. Research suggests that this may be one of the most important factors for positive youth development.

UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP . . .
Because of the unique partnership between USDA, University of California, and county governments, private funds raised for 4H go directly to support programs for youth.
