420 Relief is a marijuana consultation clinic (NOT a dispensary) located downtown. According to http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/davisfirstmedicalmarijuanaclinicopensdowntown/ an article in The Davis Enterprise, 420 Relief has a staff of licensed medical doctors who write medical marijuana prescriptions. The owner, Steve Maki, has three other clinics in the Sacramento area.  Treatable ailments include eczema, cancer, herpes, bipolar disorder, alcoholism and obesity.  Patients must show supporting documentation of symptoms from their primary care doctor.  Patients must also be 18 and older, or between 16 and 18 years old and accompanied by a parent or legal caregiver who has to sign the necessary paperwork.

The Davis location opened in 2011. It was previously occupied by Suite E and before that, Jacksonfly Recycled Fashion.



>BEWARE BEWARE!!  THIS PLACE USES DOCTORS THAT CANT WORK FOR A REAL CLINIC OR HOSPITAL DUE TO THEIR LICENSE STATUS!! BEWARE!! CARDS ARE NO GOOD REALLY ANYWHERE!!! <


20110517 10:58:09 nbsp The get your card today! line on their webpage is so shady.  I dont have any problem with medical marijuana, but clinics like this quite obviously set themselves up as subscription services where you pay a little money and get a cannabis card, done and done.  As long as the law limits marijuana use to medical applications, places that pass out cards like gym memberships rate pretty high on the shadiness factor in my book.

Lest anyone get the wrong impression, Im not making any comment on marijuana law.  Only on the way places like this do business given the current state of the law. Users/TomGarberson

20110517 14:49:57 nbsp If dude wants doctors to gamble with their licenses on giving cards to people who arent deserving that is the choice they make Users/StevenDaubert

20110601 20:34:23 nbsp My Herb card is invalid because the Bastard who runs the clinic is under investigation from the State!  Dont go there.  You are much better off going somewhere else.   Users/Friar

 This place uses doctors that cant work anywhere else. If you call and get their license numbers they all have issues or problems, Most dispensaries in Sacramento WILL NOT ACCEPT THEM! Beware!!

20110907 16:14:58 nbsp BEWARE!!! Recommendations from this place is sketchy!! You might be able to use them or maybe not, mine wasnt accepted but one place in Sacramento  BEWARE!!!! Users/BobbyMcAlister

20110912 03:05:13 nbsp They hand out cards like theyre candy and fail to explain to those qualifying for them that they are for home and personal use and do not give them free reign to smoke wherever and whenever they wish. It is a blight on the city of Davis and I am sick of these barely legal doctors and theyre idiotic scams.

Yes, some people are aided by the use of this drug... Hell half of my friends use it and I don;t care at all about its uses or its legality. What I do care about is when some scam artist clinic of doctors with visible problems longer than my arms try to practice by scamming people out of their hard earned cash for the possibility of obtaining a card.

Have I gotten a card? No. Have I been there? No. Do I know many who have? Yes.

This place is nothing more than a circus troupe of imbeciles trying to get a buck for doing nothing. Users/WesP
