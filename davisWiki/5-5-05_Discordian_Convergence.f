Being that 5505 is the best example of synchronicity with the wiki:WikiPedia:Law_of_Fives#The_Law_of_Fives Law of Fives weve ever seen, the Students for an Orwellian Society American Brontosaurus Cabal of Davis Eristopia (Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion ABCDE) in association with the Nontheist Church of St. Christopher Discordian took a pilgrimage on this day to the http://maps.google.com/maps?qWoodlawn+Memorial+Park+1000+El+Camino+Real,+Colma+California&ll37.682100,122.463300&spn0.011630,0.018432&tk&hlen most sacred of places, the grave site of wiki:WikiPedia:Emperor_Norton Emperor Norton I.  We left around 1:00 and arrived there around 3:00.  Ceremonies were held at 5:55PM.  By the way, it was a Thursday  the fifth day of the week.

After meeting at the MU around noon or so, we departed for the grave site.  The Davis cabal spent about an hour looking for the grave, because asking for directions was less fun than trying to read the Chinese tombstones.  Eventually, they all found it.  Emperor Joshua Norton III also showed up to pay respects to his forebear.  After a short ceremony  shortened due to the closing of the cemetery, we all departed to Chevys where we found that they were celebrating 5505 as well!  We  decided that there were too many drunken people there and departed for a Chinese restaurant instead.  All in all, it was a good time.
