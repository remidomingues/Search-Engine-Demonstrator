530 Riders, a tight knit but open motorcycling Community Organizations community, started in 2002 to help organize group rides for those who live in Davis and the Area Codes 530 area code. It is open to anyone with an interest in motorcycles; motorcyclists of any skill level are welcome.

Group rides are commonly organized for fellow motorcyclists to get together and enjoy our common passion.  There is no pressure to ride fast, to stunt or ride any way that would make people uncomfortable. This group is just a way to get riders together for one purpose: to have fun on our bikes. There is a place for every rider, whether all youve done is commute to school or have a few track days under your belt. So sign up and introduce yourself, let us know what bike you ride, and enjoy.
