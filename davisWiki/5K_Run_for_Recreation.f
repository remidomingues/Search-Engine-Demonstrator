The 5K Run for Recreation is a 3.1 mile running footrace held by Intramural Sports. 2010 is the first year it has been held by Intramural Sports. There has always been a large population of runners found running around Davis and the UC Davis campus area, especially the Arboretum. Seeing this, Intramural Sports thought it would be a good idea to host an event for runners (http://budget.ucdavis.edu/studentfees/documents/special/studentfeeoverview.pdf IM Sports fees need to be spent somehow).  The 2010 event takes place May 15 at 9 a.m. for the competitive level and 9:15 a.m. for the recreational level. The 2010 run begins and ends at Hutchison IM Field. There is a $10 entry fee and the top female and the top male runners in the competitive level will receive a IM Sports Champion TShirt and have their photo up on the Hall of Fame.

To promote this event IM sports is offering  gift bag to the first 50 entries.


20100426 15:49:37 nbsp Marathons cost money to operate. Runners have been running for free all this time, why spend money to have people run unless there is a charity involved or something? Users/hankim

20100426 17:06:46 nbsp Does the run require a Reg Card or an IM Card, or is it open to the public?  If its open to the public, are there any entry fees? Users/TomGarberson
  It does require an IM card if you are not a registered student. The fee is $10 per runner.
