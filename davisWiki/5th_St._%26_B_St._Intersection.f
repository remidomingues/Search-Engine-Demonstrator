The intersection of 5th Street & B Street has some traffic issues, and also hides a street name change:

  This intersection marks the boundary between Russell Boulevard (to the west) and 5th Street (to the east).

  On Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, the Davis Farmers Market cones off one of the two eastbound lanes on 5th Street, just past this intersection.  Be ready for a quick merge!

  The leftturn lane from northbound B Street onto westbound Russell Blvd is one of the longest waits in Davis.  You are almost always better off turning left onto 4th Street instead, and then turning right on University Avenue.  Youll usually be able to make a left turn onto Russell Blvd from there before the left turn light at B Street goes green.

  Pedestrians beware when crossing Russell Blvd on the west side of the intersection.  Cars making a right from Russell Blvd onto B Street have a yield sign, but are rarely going slow enough to actually yield to a walker.  XThe high bushes at the corner dont help matters, as it makes pedestrians that much harder to seeX.  The bushes have been cut back.

  Under the 5th Street redesign proposed redesign of Fifth Street through downtown Davis, bike lanes would be added to Russell east of A Street, and cars heading east toward B would have one lane for turning right, and one left lane for staying on Fifth. In the http://davisbicycles.org/projects/5thstreet/feb09_oldnorth_oped.html oped article that appeared in the Enterprise in February, the road diet proponents note that the amount of traffic going onto B is nearly the same as the amount of traffic continuing straight on Fifth.


20070922 13:09:58 nbsp why are the cones there during the farmers market. It makes no sense. Are they trying to prevent people from making rights onto C? Users/MattHh

20070922 14:12:48 nbsp Its suppose to slow down traffic so people can cross 5th street easier. Users/JamesSchwab

20080704 01:44:14 nbsp I would also assume that it is easier for people to cross the street with one lane of traffic over two. If one car stops for pedestrians with both lanes open, you still have to wait for (hope for) the other lane to let you go. With one lane, one kind motorist is all you need to clear your path (for one direction of traffic at least).

20090408 16:04:41 nbsp But Its weird that they add the cones in order for pedestrians to cross there when theres no crosswalk or stop sign.  Theyre basically facilitating jaywalking.  It makes sense to try make it easier to cross from the parking lot to the market, but other then inferring from the cones, how are motorists supposed to know to yield to pedestrians crossing in the middle of the street?  It seems dangerous, because just having the cones there does not legally require motorists to yield to a pedestrian trying to cross.  Pedestrians and most motorists familiar with the area know the routine, but it is probably confusing for drivers new to the area.  A good fix would be to post a temporary pedestrian crossing sign.  A temporary crosswalk might be more difficult, but its probably possible.   Users/MatthewPearson

20090731 22:24:45 nbsp I thought it is legal for a pedestrian to cross at any street corner even if there isnt crosswalk. Users/Kehaar
