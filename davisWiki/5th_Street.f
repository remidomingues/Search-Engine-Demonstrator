5th Street is a streets street that runs eastwest and it turns into Russell Russell Blvd. when it intersections crosses B Street.  It stretches from Downtown to East Davis, where it terminates at Alhambra Drive. Fifth Street and Russell Blvd. combine to make one of the most important eastwest thoroughfares in Davis.

The section that runs between L Street and B Street lacks bike lanes.  Though many cyclists choose to merge with auto traffic, some cyclists feel more comfortable detouring onto 8th Street for this section. In February 2005, splitphase traffic lights were installed at the F Street and G Street intersections to reduce the number of crashes due to drivers making left turns into oncoming traffic from 5th Street (108 crashes from 19992002). Traveling eastbound approaching L Street, the left lane becomes a turn only lane.

5th Street redesign A reconfiguration of the street, to one traffic lane in each direction, plus bike lanes and center turn lanes between B and L Streets, is expected to be completed by mid2014. Follow the latter link to more detailed description of this portion of the street and project details.

5th Street was formerly known as 4th Street.
