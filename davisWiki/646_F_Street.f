The late Davis resident and UC Davis employee Jim Downing helped his father build the Address(646 F Street F St) residence in 1938. Jim lived at 646 F as a child and later in life with his wife Bobbie and their children. One of the unique elements of the house is a sevenfootlong bathtub that was built to accommodate Jims father.
