66 Roessler Hall Roessler is a Campus Lecture Halls lecture hall that is basically the home of lowerdivision physics courses.  This is quite evident in the fact that ALL lectures for ALL of Physics 7ABC and 9ABCD are held within this building. For students with physics majors, or for those with science/engineering majors, you will be well acquainted with this hall for your first two years on campus.

According to the registrar of UCD, the hall can officially seat 186 people.

There is an underground hallway that connects 66 Roessler to 55 Roessler. Around 2002, the room received brand new chairs. Prior to this the chairs featured old cushions with springs and that made quite a bit of noise.
