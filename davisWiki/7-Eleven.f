There is a Citibank branded ATMs ATM inside the store which Citibank users can use without paying a surcharge.

The ATM is also part of the CoOp ATM network and is free for members of all Davis Credit Unions credit unions and virtually all other credit unions across the country as well. There is also a East Davis Phones payphone for public use.

20110712 01:23:26 nbsp After walking in post Free Slurpee Day all I can say is some people are disgusting, greedy slobs. There was such a mess it was utterly ridiculous... The staff was cleaning for almost two hours trying to recover from the insanity. Users/WesP
  But you probably already knew that from working at Little Prague. Users/hankim

20120728 10:16:29 nbsp I just went into the store, they remodeled and its looking great now plus theres new staff. Theyre also giving out free small slurpees! Users/SoupJill
  Removed the entirety of the old staff, even those who worked their tails off for the company for several years, and threw a new coat of paint on old dingy walls... Store went under new ownership for losing money quarterly, now you continue the trend as I am not setting foot in the locale again. Users/WesP
