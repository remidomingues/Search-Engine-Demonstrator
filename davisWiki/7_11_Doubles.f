7 11 Doubles is a drinking games drinking game.

 Materials 

  A community cup
  A pair of dice

Object
  Roll a 7, 11 or doubles to get your friends fed up.

 Rules 

  Determine who starts by each rolling one die.  Player with the highest roll starts.
  The first player rolls both dice.  Determine if you rolled an additive 7 or 11, or a doubles.  For example, rolling a 3 and 4 on each die gives a 7.  Herein lies some of the trickiness of this game.  Adding can become difficult when intoxicated.
  If the roll doesnt yield a 7, 11 or doubles, the dice are passed to the next player.
  If the roll does yield a 7, 11 or doubles, the fun starts.
  Fill up the community cup to a chuggable amount.  The more beer in the cup, the harder.  Usually about 2 shots worth is used.
  The roller of the 7, 11 or doubles chooses a drinker.
  Now, the appointed drinker must drink the cup following specific rules.  As soon as the drinker touches the cup, the roller will try to get another 7,11, doubles before the drinker finishes and put their cup back on the table.  It is important for both parties to be paying attention.  The drinker must not accidentally touch the cup before they are ready to drink as fast as possible.  Also, the roller must not touch the dice until the drinker touches the cup.  Otherwise, roles reverse so that the drinker becomes the roller and visa versa.
  If the roller rolls another 7, 11, doubles before the drinker slams down their cup, the drinker must drink again while the roller is trying to get another 7,11, doubles.  Lucky rolls can lead to messed up friends.  If the same person keeps having to drink, another player can make a save, where they grab the cup and drink it.  However, if the roller rolls a 7,11, doubles before the cup is back down on the table...you guessed it!  The person who saved has to drink again (and maybe again).
  If the drinker beats the roller (i.e. the roller does not get 7,11, doubles before the drinker is done and the cup is back on the table), the dice are passed to the person to the left and that person becomes the roller.  (Some people also play that if the drinker wins, they get to roll next.)
