20120412 12:11:28 nbsp I know that this company has never broken any laws regarding its driving and it disturbs me to know that people can just put things online that are unsubstantiated and untrue...Its a shame! Users/americka

20121006 04:43:15 nbsp I called this cab service for a guest, who needed an immediate ride to the airport (SMF) because the cab she had originally arranged for didnt show up on time. 30 minutes later her cab DID show, so I called 24/7 Taxi Cab Company back to let them know that the guest had left and no longer needed a ride. Clearly irritated, the person who answered said, and I quote, She already got another cab? Then why call? This is why I dont pick up the fucking phone for people... This is bullshit... He muttered some other things and just hung up. Based on that call, I can say with some confidence that youre probably better off using another taxi service, as it seems that giving people a ride is too inconvenient for this company.

To the driver (quoted above): if youre pissed off because someone called you to DO YOUR JOB, then maybe you should get another fucking job. Food for thought... Users/DividedEye

20121024 19:33:16 nbsp In response to DividedEye: You called me to pick up your guest, this happens many times and we waste alot of time, gas and lose other customers at times because of this very situation. You called me for a ride and i was en route to pick up your guest and i was on time. You should have called the other taxi and cancelled when you knew i was coming to pick up your customer. Even i called you when i was almost there and you said okay. After a couple minutes you called me and said the other cab picked up the customer. How did you think i would feel? Instead you called and cancelled me! I have been driving taxi for nearly 5 years. This happens all the time. Even i just got off work from driving taxi all nite just two hours earlier.If you dont have any consideration to the person who will render you service then dont call the person and ask for service. However, if you dont like the way i spoke to you then i am sorry. Users/andrewnnodim


20140610 14:09:34 nbsp I do not recommend this taxi company. The taxi was a very beatup minivan, the buckle encasing was missing, and worst of all there is NO air conditioning. He left the windows rolled down the whole time and it was over 100 degrees outside. I was headed to a nice event and my hair got all messed up and I sweated through my clothes due to the heat. Absolutely unacceptable and not worth a $60 trip to Sacramento from Davis. Do NOT use this service. Users/TerynGray
