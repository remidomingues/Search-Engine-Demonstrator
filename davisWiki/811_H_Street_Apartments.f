20080424 21:38:09 nbsp I recently moved in along with 7 other girls. Initially the place was a complete mess  holes in wall, filthy bathrooms, disgustingly dirty carpet (which they only vacuumed and steamcleaned, but stains are still visible). After much deliberation with the landlord, the place was a bit more habitable. There are things still left to fix and Kit, the landlord is sometimes a bit unresponsive to our calls. Things only get done once youve insisted a thousand times. She is nice though. Neighbors are ok. Laundry room is always left open, and as a result, it can get pretty dirty. Overall CHEAP place. 400 range for your own room. BUT beware: rats do live in the walls and you can sometimes hear them at night. Called ROOTER, said they fixed the problem... but apparently not.

PROBABLY CHEAPEST PLACE IN DAVIS... Users/Katana
