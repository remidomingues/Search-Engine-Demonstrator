The 8^th^ and G crosswalk is located along the west side of the intersection of 8th Street and G Street.

CAUTION  DANGER!

Drivers often drove right through the red light Footnote(Imagine the revenue if they installed a Red Light Cameras red light camera here! (sarcasm, as revenue should never be a motive for installing a red light camera)). when it was still installed. The red light was removed in June 2009. Always look before you cross.

The T intersection of 8th street and G street and the accompanying stoplight was not something drivers who were unfamiliar with the area expected. It was even more unexpected given the light controlled intersection of 8^th^ and F just yards to the west and the distinct lack of tree trimming around the signals. The number of drivers who run this red light was higher than other intersections. When the removed the light they changed the painting of the crosswalk to a large checkerboard pattern.

 History 

It would be fascinating to get the minutes of the City Council meetings where the decision to put this crossing in occurred.


20060828 19:46:48 nbsp I cross here twice most every day and I often see someone drive through the red light. A red light camera would be a very good idea.  Users/PaulThober

20060830 09:08:51 nbsp Im not sure how much a redlight camera will increase safety at this interesection...it will catch a lot of red light runners....but as far as decreasing the number of runners I am not optimistic. The street could have brighter markings, the branches cleared away and perhaps a brighter light. I sent a concern into the City yesterday at this http://www.city.davis.ca.us/crm/ site. I would suggest anyone else who is concerned to do the same. As a tragic reminder, the once dangerous intersection at F at 4th finalyy became a 4way stop sign only after Council member Saylor got into a car accident there. Lets not have an accident or worse be the catalyst for change here. Users/JamesSchwab

20060830 09:46:50 nbsp A camera most certainly would make this a safer place to cross. Without doubt fewer people would run the red light. Users/PaulThober

20060830 13:01:47 nbsp I say take the pedestrian only signal out and just make people walk the few extra yards to the signal at F and 8th that isnt so unexpected or hard to see. Users/JevanGray

Just received this in my email from the City: Thank you for contacting the Davis Public Works Department.  The following Work orders have been generated and issued:  Work Order #06003535 for the tree branches blocking the signal light; and Work Order #06003536 for the paint on the crosswalk that is faded.  If you have any questions regarding this work order, please call (530) 7575686 or email us at: pwweb@cityofdavis.org  I received this today, August 30th. Lets see how long it takes to get the work order finished.Users/JimSchwab

20070624 18:04:11 nbsp One rationale for this crosswalk was probably the nearby senior housing and that its on the direct route to the Food COOP and other stores in the G St. mall. It is also obvious to anybody who really observes human behavior that people will not go  a block out of their way to cross a street. However, seniors who hope to become even more senior are extremely careful about using this crosswalk and any other crosswalk on 8th, 5th, F or B Streets because bikes, cars & skateboarders in Davis all treat pedestrians as a nuisance. As for the F & 8th intersection, (and 8th & B too), turning cars and bikes routinely ignore pedestrians Users/ValerieVann
