Yolo Property Management partnered with UC Davis to meet the need for Graduate Student Housing and is currently constructing 8th and Wake.  Consisting of two four story towers, this exciting LEED Gold Certified green building project is currently under construction at the previous site of Castilian Hall at the curve of West 8th Street and Wake Forest Drive  thus the location inspired the name of 8th and Wake.

8th and Wake is a uniquely designed community that is located one block away from the UC Davis campus that provides an ideal environment for graduate students. We offer by bedroom leasing, where each unit includes a full size washer and dryer, furnished common areas, and the option of furnished bedrooms. 8th and Wake is positioned within a mile of the University Mall that contains a Trader Joes, Starbucks, Subway, and much more. 8th and Wake provides all the necessary onsite amenities that are vital for any UC Davis graduate student including a study lounge with free WiFi, private meeting rooms, and community computers and printing.

A mobile leasing office situated on the construction site offers prospective residents hard hat property tours of both the community amenities and floor plan.  The leasing office is open Fridays and Saturdays from 11:00 to 6:00 or by appointment.  The community is currently signing leases by bedroom to any UCD Davis student that will be enrolled in a graduate school for Fall of 2014  thats correct: Graduate Students Only.  We offer two lease start dates to accommodate the unique graduate schools academic calendars.  A majority of the South Tower is currently signing leases for movein dates on August 1, 2014 while the North Tower is signing leases for primarily September 1, 2014 movein dates based on graduate student needs.


Each of the 59 units that comprise the two building community is a four bedroom suitestyle floor plan with leases by bedroom.  Residents will be living with strangers or friends based on preference.  For example, a graduate student can sign a lease for a single bedroom in any unit with four people they have not yet met OR four graduate student friends can each sign a lease for bedrooms A, B, C, and D to occupy the entire unit.  Each bedroom has a monthly rental rate of $632.00 with a $200 security deposit and includes water, sewer and trash.  PG&E service will be billed back to each of the four roommates equally.  Comcast is an optional account by bedroom or unit based on the roommates decision.  The living room and kitchen will be fully furnished with a sofa, coffee table, two accent chairs, a side table, and a four person bistro dinning table.  Bedroom furniture is optional at $18.00 a month and includes a desk and chair, a stackable/underbed dresser, nightstand, and a double/full sized bed frame and mattress.
