20090208 10:20:34 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName and behaving in a respectful manner. Your http://daviswiki.org/Adobe_at_Evergreen?actiondiff&version2104&version1103 comment is just another precedent for allowing the reversal of edits made by people using pseudonymous accounts. Seriously, why should the Wiki community value and respect a comment like that? You could choose to stand behind your words with your real name and choose them more carefully and other editors would protect your comment from being removed. Users/JasonAller
