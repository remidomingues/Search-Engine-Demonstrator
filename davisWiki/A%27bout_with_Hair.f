20051018 15:42:04 nbsp Becky Digman who is the owner of the salon is really great.  Shell do whatever you ask, but I think her highlights and eyebrow waxes are the best Ive ever had. AntoniaOakley

20090422 14:36:58 nbsp I had my hair ruined at another salon. I went in to see Karen and she is the best. She spent hours on my hair (bleeched the roots, colored the roots, toned and conditioned my hair) Even better she throws in a free cut and style. It doesnt get much better. She did it all for $80 which is great for all the work I needed. Its much cheaper if all you need is a touchup.  Users/ucdruby

20090629 13:27:07 nbsp The people at this place are really nice. You get what you ask for. The difference is that at many Asian own salons they do whatever they want to with your hair. It is a great deal for $25. You get free shampoo and blow dry with it. Users/FlowerCindy

20100402 10:17:11 nbsp I love Becky for color.  Nobody has ever done it better for me.  Karen does modern, hip cuts.  Its always fun to go there.  Kinda Steel Magnolias and just so much kindness! Users/FreddieOakley

20100422 14:57:25 nbsp I go to Karen for my haircut and shes great! I always leave happy after she cuts my hair...She washes my hair, cuts it, blow dries it and styles it all for $25 + tip....The rest of the women/hairdressers seem very sweet and the owner, Becky, has a good sense of humor. My only complaint is that the last 2 times I was there, Karen seemed very busy and seemed to be rushing since she had someone on the side whose hair was getting colored. I didnt like that, but in the end Karen did a good job so I left happy after all. I also have taken my 4 year old daughter here for a haircut. I dont recall the hairdressers name, but she did a fabulous job. She was very friendly and most importantly very patient with my daughter.
Also, this place is one of the cheapest in Davis. I have called other hair salons and their haircuts start at least $45...Im a student and I definitely dont want to spend $45+tip on a haircut. On the other hand, About with hair is very affordable and they do a great job!  Users/areli00

20110531 15:30:43 nbsp My daughter and I needed haircuts, a special day. Ive rarely been happy with haircuts. Found about with hair and Nancy Reid. We love our new cuts, even a week later. I will be going back:D Users/CADowning

20110531 15:49:21 nbsp Can someone explain the name of this salon to a dorky old professor?  Do they fight with your hair? Users/CovertProfessor

20110713 10:07:21 nbsp I had a great experience at About with Hair. I was instantly comfortable with Karen and told her to fix the way my hair was growing out. she listened and gave me a great cut. Super friendly and cheap for the quality! Users/LenaSchiffer

20120128 21:53:21 nbsp I went in to Becky for a blunt cut and its great! Then today, I took my daughter in there who has little dreadlocks, and Becky let me  bring my own shampoo, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil....we gave her a shampoo together, vinegar rinsed her, poured oil on, wrapped her head in a warm towel, sat her under the hood dryer, then rinsed it all out and conditioned it. She was SOOOO accommodating....my daughters hair looks GREAT and it was so much easier to do in a salon than trying to do it all at home, bending over the tub, and I dont have a hood dryer. I will be back once a month for my daughters intensive and Ill be getting my hair cut here!! Thanks Becky! Users/StephHolm

20120306 23:07:50 nbsp I having been going to see Becky and Karen for years, and I have never ever walked out of there unhappy. They do the best job in town! I once got an absolutely dreadful cut somewhere else here in town, I actually went home in tears. I called and went in the next day to see Karen and she made it fabulous! I will never stray again Users/TaylorKennedy

20120320 21:49:51 nbsp I went here a few weeks ago looking for a cut and color. My color was great but they totally ruined my hair! I walked with with healthy hair and I walked out with dry, brittle, frizzy hair and I cant fix it! I always leave a salon with healthy feeling hair but this time I didnt! I will
Not be going back and now need to go find a new hairdresser to
Fix the mess they left me with! Users/JamieBee

20120427 19:41:04 nbsp Tanya did the best pedicure and manicure, great massage. Im going back next time and getting gel nails! Fun shop! Users/mali

20120519 13:01:05 nbsp I am totally disappointed with my hair after going here. I went in, said I wanted about 2 inches off the length. The hairdresser, although it was obvious she was just selling product, I was convinced to try some kind of deep conditioner for an extra fee. I said I absolutely wanted to keep my natural color (I never dye my hair or anything), and she promised me it will keep my hair the same but just make it healthier. Well of course my hair is now quite a few shades darker, all of my natural blonde is gone. Not to mention she didnt take any length off during the cut! My hair is just as long as when I went in. Im very upset with how my hair turned out. Users/goldenc

20120611 11:26:19 nbsp I go here for my hair and I have thick, natural curly hair. Nancy Reid does such a great job. Very happy. She is very patience. Its a relaxing and caring atmosphere. Users/Lisa530

20120925 16:29:27 nbsp Every time I stray from Becky Digmans capable hands, I end up returning.  She never asks where Ive been, and just picks up again like the old friend she is.  She has been with me through thick and thin. Literally!  (She  made the most of what I had when I was being treated for breast cancer.)  Her salon is very Steel Magnolias. Its not the place to go if you want that whole ultrasophisticated big city treatment.  On the other hand, this is not a big city and her prices are very reasonable, really bargainbasement in my opinion. She always does impeccable work.  She never takes shortcuts. She doesnt gossip about her other clients (yay!) and she will see you for emergencies and to correct the bad work of others.  She keeps excellent records and can tell you exactly what she did for you five years ago. She has given me the best color ever.  Did our hair for my daughters wedding and we all looked exactly the way we wanted to. You can be 100% forthright about what you want.  She is an amazing person and a real pro. Users/FreddieOakley
