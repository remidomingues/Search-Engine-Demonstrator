20101127 12:46:07 nbsp I worked with Anthony to upgrade my laptop from Windows Vista to Windows 7.0.  Called him in the AM, brought it to him, and was finished just a couple of hours later.  Great service and very professional.  100% recommend this service. Users/SSambucci

20110224 00:15:52 nbsp I downloaded a file that contained a virus and made my computer crash. I couldnt log on afterwards, or even start in safe mode. Anthony reformatted my hard drive and was able to save all of my files. I dropped my computer off before class and he was done by the time I was out. Reasonably priced and very professional.
