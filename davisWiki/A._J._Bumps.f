A.J. Bumps is G Street Pubs longdead predecessor from the midlate eighties. It was something of a Republican version of the G Street... kinda like a cross between G Street and Sudwerk Brewery. It was still a pubstyle restaurant with booths, waitress service, and I think they had live music as well.

I miss their carrot casserole, which you could have instead of a salad.  I heard a rumor once that it was made with carrots and crumbled crackers.  Does anyone have the recipe? BarbaraKing
