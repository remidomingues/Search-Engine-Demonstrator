20130301 10:20:42 nbsp Just got my smog done here today.  The 3 month special price was great and I was out the door with certificate for less than 50 bucks.  Jon was super nice and it took 1520 minutes to get the job done.   Users/loneshark

20130305 18:38:28 nbsp Great place to get your motor coach and cars smogged. Lots of space to maneuver any size coach, easy entry and exit. Then you get Jon who is professional and efficient and seems like a really nice guy too!! I highly recommend this place. I know we will be taking all our vehicles there from now on when their number comes up! Users/SandyFisher

20130312 13:48:26 nbsp Jon was a very helpful and earnest guy. He even offered to smog any car I bring in at his sale price forever if I bring in my receipt from before! I was inandout very quickly, and everything was very simple. He is STAR certified as well, which I needed this time. I would highly recommend this shop to anyone and will be taking both of my cars to him. Users/KeithJorgenson

20130531 01:41:41 nbsp A1 Smog and Jon are great. He is honest, professional, dependable, fast, very reasonably priced, and very personable. Hes a great guy. His smog shop is clean, professional, organized, and the cushy black chairs and wide variety of magazines make the 15 minute wait go fast. You will be happy you selected A1 Smog. Users/MichaelAlexander

20130609 08:16:25 nbsp Went to A1 on my lunch break for a smog check and Jon was very nice and worked fast. I was in and out in no time. I could find smog shops in Sac that are a few dollars cheaper but I would rather pay a little more for better customer service and to spend a lot less time waiting for my car. Users/JenniferH

He tells you exactly how long it will take and is very efficient.  This location is extremely convenient for South Davis residents.  Fast and easy and no wait.  I was very happy to give my business to A1 Smog Shop! I will bring all of our cars there.  And its a star certified station which was required on my renewal notice. Users/KileyA
