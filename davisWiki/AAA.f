Political Controversy
While it is generally thought of as a group that provides free maps and emergency towing.  It is also a lobbying group for automobile related interests.  They have been known to lobby for road expansion and improvement, while fighting environmental programs.  However, they also lobby for stronger safety measures and laws to increase driver protection.
