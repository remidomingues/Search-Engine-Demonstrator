20070210 20:04:15 nbsp Absolutely appalling. I took my car in to get the transmission rebuilt literally over a month ago...and they still have it. First they misdiagnosed the problem, even though two garages before me had told me it was my transmission.  Then after paying for the other job, they realized they were wrong and had it for two more weeks.  I would get a call every day about how the part wasnt in or the delivery person lost it. I took it home only to have it not start the next morning and had to take it BACK in where it sits a week later with parts already broken that they replaced when they rebuilt the transmission.  Do not be lured in by the deals online or the warranties. It is absolutely not worth taking your car to this place. Take it to University Auto where they have competent technicians and parts dealers.  DavisClimber

20070807 13:43:07 nbsp I had a great experience here. They were able to get me a discounted cost on the towing fee to their shop after the tow truck driver initially refused to and then called me twice daily to let me know the status of my car. I just got a ton of repairs on my car so they understood my concern and checked out everything that just got replaced. Brought it on Friday night they found out what was wrong with it Saturday and I got it back Monday morning, pretty good considering it took a week to get my car back prior to that at another shop. Staff was very friendly and reliable. Made sure I understood everything that was going on and I felt prices were very fair for everything they did. I would definitely recommend this place and I plan on going here in future. Users/toki

20071005 20:13:32 nbsp I took my car here to have the transmission checked. They couldnt find anything with the $95 diagnostics, so wanted $750 to do internal diagnostics. I declined, after which they called me several times with a really hard sell for the internal diagnostics. When I went to pick up the car, they had come up with over $1000 of unrelated recommended repairs. I declined this too and took my car to my regular maintenance shop, where they told me none of the work AAMCO wrote up as recommended actually needed to be done. Beware of this place.

20071015 15:03:09 nbsp great service..honest and fixed right the first time Users/tito

20071015 15:12:34 nbsp highly recommend for honest work done in such a prompt manner...as a student and a business major with some sort of understanding of technical/mechanical function these guys really do make it easy to understand the way a transmission or any general repair need to keep vehicle up to manafacturer standards..yes sometimes delays in parts..or limited on time for example who expects to have transmission repair on a half day say saturday..not me! it took 3 days and one day delay on parts...technically well equiped shop..customer service superior..and very clean like their reputation from what i can gather...

20071122 17:25:29 nbsp I had a reasonably positive experience here. The shop was clean, the mechanics seemed knowledgeable, and the office manager was friendly. Their main deficiency is that they dont seem to have a lot of parts in stock, so if the part is not available locally, they have to order from a supplier in Sacramento. This part supplier seems to miss making some deliveries. They ended up having to keep my car overnight because they didnt receive a part on time from the supplier, but that wasnt a big deal to me. The manager was nice and kept me updated on the status of the repairs. The final bill was right on with the estimate and so far I havent had any problems with their work. Users/RyanCoates

20080612 14:50:02 nbsp So, I just took my car in yesterday to get the solonoid on my transmission replaced.  I got it diagnosed at the dealership  and then took it to AAMCO for repairs.  I had such a positive experience that I decided to (finally!) make a wiki account and comment.

The guys there (especially Ruben) were so ridiculously nice and helpful.  They seemed genuine in their want to help me and save me money.  I called them once a couple weeks ago to find out about how much it would be to get it fixed.  I was supposed to take my car down to them the next day, but I got busy with work and couldnt.  They called me up the next day to followup and to let me know that they could still fix it if I wanted to have them do so.  I never picked up when they called, but finally they called me again when I had some money to spend to fix the car and I brought it down there.  They were happy I did and so was I.  They had to keep it overnight as the part didnt get there fast enough, but they called with updates to let me know what was going on.  They finished it the next morning and even took the time to do a total inspection of the car to make sure it was safe for me to drive (without charging me for it).  I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone having transmission problems.  Theyre great! Users/SarahOsler

20080905 14:41:45 nbsp Dont do it.  Although Ruben is nice, they will still try to screw you.

They tried to charge me $500+ to replace a bunch of stuff I had replaced 2 years ago.  When I complained about the price, the response was well, how much do you have?  A classic response from a ripoff artist... disguised as hey, we try to take care of people... especially students who will be around for 25 years and are too busy to take their car anywhere outside of Davis.

I decided to let them change the oil, what could it hurt, and I would get back to them on the other stuff.  They had my car all day, yet it wasnt ready when I stopped by just before closing!  They charged me for the oil change but didnt fill half the fluids!  Despite watching Ruben change the oil, he blamed the oversight on another employee who wasnt there.  At least the oil filter looked new...

I took my car back to the people who originally changed my plugs, wires, etc.  They took the time to show me what bad plugs, wires, etc look like vs. the perfectly fine (2 year old) parts I had. Users/wchrist

20080910 20:48:26 nbsp I brought in an old Japanese car which automatic transmission was slipping badly.  To get it initially diagnosed was a $95 charge, and consisted of trying to drive it out of the parking lot.  A real diagnostic which would have involved taking it apart would have been $700+, minus the $95.  To replace the soft parts (seals, etc) and get a 12 month/12,000 mi warranty would have been $3000+, again minus the $95.  I stopped at the $95.

Then I was offered sort of a side deal.  The counter dude had a friend who would replace the tranny with a used one.  No warranty but for an old car why not? But his buddy couldnt even test the used tranny because it came from a wrecked car or such...would have been around $1200 with no warranty and not even sure it worked before.  At least the counter guy and his buddy didnt try to deceive about that. Users/RalphFinch

Users/EricOliver

20091116 12:08:22 nbsp I recently needed a transmission checkup on our 1998 Mercury Villager, so I took a look at Davis Wiki to see who was in town and what was said about them. I was a little cautious after seeing a few negative comments over the last few years for AAMCO Transmission, but I decided to give them a try anyway. It is local and I didnt want to travel out of town.

I gave them a call and talked with the new manager, Eric Oliver. Nice guy, and he was able to set me up with an appointment the same day. It turned out that we had 3 engine mounts broken which were causing the noise issues, so transmission work was not requried. They were able to replace these and all is good. I appreciated Erics questions and the care he took in understanding the problem and finding the right solution. I would definitely go back if I needed transmission work done, although Im hoping to get lucky enough not to need it.  :>

20100305 18:49:35 nbsp I would definitely recommend going here.  I had the brakes on my car replaced today and was very pleased with the honesty and timeliness of the work.  Sean who works at the front desk explained everything that they were doing and gave me a very accurate and reasonable estimate.  The work was done in just a few hours for exactly what he quoted me.  Very happy with my experience and I will be coming back here in the future!  Users/amerc

20101124 18:44:11 nbsp I went here a while back, when I was working at Target and didnt really have any free capital to spend on anything, and they provided me with a scan to see what was causing my check engine light to come on, for free. They were fast and courteous and didnt seem put off when I basically said I wasnt going to be able to pay for the part to be replaced for a while. With that good experience in mind, I took my car back there today (the day before Thanksgiving). On my way home from work, my brakes began making an alarming grinding noise, so I went in to get it checked out. I got there around 5:15, and they close at 6:00. They figured out what was wrong, replaced it. The price was good, but even better was the fact that they made it possible for me to get to the Bay Area for Thanksgiving. I will most definitely be going back in the future for my repair and tuneup needs. Users/JoePomidor

20110109 12:21:54 nbsp Nice job.  I came in with a check engine light on.  After the free check, they figured it was caused by my gas cap being loose.  We screwed it on tight and off I went.  No cost and no madeup problem.  Thank you! Users/toolej

20110122 13:55:59 nbsp Service has been good so far but the website says its open Saturdays and its definitely not. One of the reasons I took my car there was so I could get it back over the weekend, and apparently the website is wrong. it should be changed immediately. Users/AmandaManoly

20110506 10:10:07 nbsp Took my car here for a second opinion on my transmission problems. Got the free diagnosis and an oil change. Staff were nice and friendly and said they would need the car for a couple hours. So I walked downtown to kill time. 5 hours later, all they could tell me was that I had a problem with the transmission, but they couldnt tell me what the problem was. Then they wanted $100/hour for 3 hours to actually diagnose the problem. I needed the car to get to work, so I refused the service. When I was getting back into the car, they told me that my front brake rotors were shot. I had just replaced the rotors a year ago, so I found this a bit unlikely. Not sure if this is indicative of their interactions with all customers, or just women, but ladies, stay away or youll get screwed.  Users/lauraAsmith

20110506 10:38:29 nbsp These guys running a scam. Paid $150 and was told to spend $750 more for noise diagnostics. After $150 inspection the manager assured me it is a transmission. FREE 5 min diagnostics in the other shop revealed front differential problem. The differential was rebuilt and the noise is gone. They should stop this scam or hire more experienced personal. And how about money back? Never go to AAMCO again. The suggestion is to go to Woodland instead. Users/snyfer

20110618 10:20:59 nbsp aamco SUCKS!! My A/C had a leak so I called aamco (since it was the first thing that popped up on Google) and asked them how much it would cost to see where the leak was coming from. The guy told me that theyd give me a free check and decide where to go from there. At this point I thought to myself aamco was awesome. I dropped the car off and 3 hours later I called them and they said the check was done. When I go in to see what the results were, the manager? (big lumpy Asian guy) told me that the a/c had a leak (Uhhh.. no shit, thats why I brought it in) and it was going to cost me $150 to see where the leak was coming from. Um, no thanks. So I took my car and left.

Funny thing is, when I brought it to another mechanic they checked under the hood and found out that the gasket was leaking just by using a flashlight. They fixed it for me for $90.

conclusion: aamco ::beep beep:: SUCKS! Users/NateChu

20110712 16:04:54 nbsp Another great experience with the staff and work at AAMCO.  My car was making horrible squeal when I turned on the AC. First we tried changing the belt, which showed signs of wear.  Next step was to change out a pulley.  This did the trick.  At each step, Moe at the desk was informative and honest!  Thank you! Ethan Users/toolej

20111203 11:02:20 nbsp Horrible experience. I went there yesterday to have my check engine light looked at at 9am in the morning because thats when James said he had a bay open. Left it there and went to work, was called at 1pm with an update and they couldnt find what was wrong with it, was called again at 3pm saying that it was an 02 sensor and was going to charge me $300 (where it should cost $150 or less) for it and $150  for labor. I agreed to have them fix it because it seemed to be the only trouble code that they found and I needed it done. At 5pm, James calls me and tells me that the work was finally done. I got it, took it home, then took it to the store and it was working fine.

The next morning, I was going to take it to the smog shop, but guess what? The check engine light came back on. For those of you who dont know, a check engine light is an automatic fail. Now its Saturday, Aamco is closed, I cant get a hold of any of the technicians that were working on my car, I cant get smogged since the check engine light is back on, Im pissed and annoyed because I cant help but feel like I was ripped off, and for all I know, all they did was unplug the battery and plug it back in to reset the check engine light and charged me $400 for it.

Avoid this place. They dont know what theyre doing. Users/DanThao

20120316 11:41:27 nbsp I had an amazing experience today! I called in the day before and explained my issue to them (my ABS/Brake lights were on) and set an appointment to bring it in for a free diagnostic test to pinpoint what was causing the issue. I was a bit cautious at first because of some of the negative reviews but they were AMAZING! Jeff and Matt were very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable and answered/addressed all my panicked questions/concerns. Prices/estimates were pretty reasonable and I was even given a ride to and from my apartment while the worked on it! Definitely coming back here for all my car related issues! :) Users/LaChanga

20120324 13:24:14 nbsp So...I got my brakes and EGR valve replaced here about a year ago, and at the time I was pleased with the level and price of the service I received here. Fast forward to today. My brother has had the car since then, and he is telling me as we speak that the quality of the parts installed and the work done is so low that were going to have to make some repairs. Its going to cost $530. I have no intention of going back there in the future. Users/TheDrDonna

20130223 09:11:27 nbsp Preface: I do not know much about automatic transmissions or cars in general. Went here a few months ago to get my automatic transmission worked on, they told me they would replace the shift kit in there and it might fix the problem they repaired it. The fix worked for about 100 miles, didnt have a chance to go back for a week due to work. Went back in and pretty much heard too bad, well take a look at it again when we have time  they take a look at it again, try to charge me another $60 for shoddy work that they did.  Unbelievable.  To take a vehicle in to a professional shop, pay $600 for a repair and pretty much get nothing out of it is extraordinary. Jeff is not to be trusted, I believe he could have informed me that the transmission was shot instead of charging me $600 for a bogus repair. I still have receipts and have thought about going to better business bureau. Users/bunsey

20130308 16:06:33 nbsp Went here today hoping to get a check engine light diagnosed, and found out they no longer offer that service for free. They now charge $60, which will go towards the cost of the repair (if they repair it). Users/TomChartrand
