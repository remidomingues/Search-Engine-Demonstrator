20080131 21:43:04 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. After looking at your http://daviswiki.org/Users/AC?actionuserinfo edit history Im not sure weather to suggest reading Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, or the NPOV discussion, or both. The reason that the comments you removed from Peak Performance were put back is that the Wiki Community has tended to favor the retention of both history and varied opinion. Users/JasonAller

20090609 07:35:55 nbsp Please stop removing other peoples comments. If you dont like what a comment says or take issue with the supposed facts it presents, respond to it with a rebuttal. Users/WilliamLewis

20090609 10:36:09 nbsp If it is a free public way of communicating the truth about a place then that is fine. This place is not here to scrutinize owners about. The truth is the truth, but when facts are put on this page that are not true, why have comments like that up. Why respond to something that is not true,  Users/AC

20090609 10:39:24 nbsp How would you like comments that were posted about you that are not true. Would you go around deleting those knowing what was said is not true, and that ruins your integrity and also could affect people dealing with you. Users/AC
   First off, who are you?  So far youve just been some random anonymous account that has been deleting the words of a fellow Davisite.  When people have asked you why you were doing what you were doing, you stayed silent and kept deleting it.  Several people have reached out to you, you ignored them and just kept doing what you were doing.  Quite frankly, youve been quite rude so far, so lets try ignoring everything that has happened and start over:  Howdy, Im Evan, and welcome to the wiki.  Pleased to meet you, Mr. or Ms. C.  It looks like youre trying to delete something somebody else wrote... whats wrong with it?  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20090805 17:58:58 nbsp Hello Evan,  I am the one of the owners of Peak Performance and quite frankly some of the comments made about myself are far from true and I do not want comments about me being posted about my club. If it is about me then email me and I will fix it. If they are issues with the club then please post them here. Half the things said on this web site are untrue. Users/AC

20090805 18:03:31 nbsp Please refrain from http://daviswiki.org/Users/AC?actiondiff&version210&version19 sneaky edits like this in the future. Youre not being particularly clever and it looks shady. Users/WilliamLewis
