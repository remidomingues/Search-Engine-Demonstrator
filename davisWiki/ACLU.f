The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is an organization that fights for civil liberties in the courts and the legislature. The ACLU is a national organization with local affiliates. Our local affiliates are the Davis Campus ACLU which does education programs and the http://www.aclunc.org/ ACLU of Northern California (ACLUNC) which actually litigates.

Local issues
  The ACLUNC has been involved in litigation surrounding the November 18, 2011 UC Davis Police Response to Occupy UC Davis pepper spray fiasco. They are behind http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/caedce/2:2012cv00450/235301/ Baker, et al v. Katehi, et al, a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by peppersprayed students and alumni against the university. They also intervened in Pike v. Regents, an Alameda County Superior Court case where John Pike and the police union sought to keep the Reynoso Report from seeing the light of day.
  The ACLU has also opposed the Student Activism Team, a defunct informal working group that surveilled campus activists. Related to this, UC Davis Police Department UC Davis police officer Joanne Zekany impersonated a department of neuroscience administrator and infiltrated a campus protest.


The American system of government is founded on two counterbalancing principles: that the majority governs, through democratically elected representatives; and that the power of a majority must be limited, to ensure individual rights.

Majority power is limited by the Constitutions Bill of Rights, which consists of the original ten amendments ratified in 1791, plus the three postCivil War amendments (the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth) and the Nineteenth Amendment (womens suffrage), adopted in 1920, and also the wiki:wikipedia:Twentyfourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution 24th.

The mission of the ACLU is to preserve all of these protections and guarantees:

     Your First Amendment rightsfreedom of speech, association and assembly. Freedom of the press, and freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church and state.
     Your right to equal protection under the law  equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.
     Your right to due process  fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.
     Your right to privacy  freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.
