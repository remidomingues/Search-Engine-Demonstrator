Coping Strategies

  Get a proper diagnosis from a professional mental health care provider (i.e. a psychiatrist, preferably someone who has lots of experience with patients with ADHD),
  Find a support system
  Eat properly (good nutrition).  Breakfast is essential.
  Exercise regularly (particularly some form of cardio).

  Connect with others who have ADHD.  Creativity and fun will ensue.  You might benefit from this.
  Get rid of the overly critical of you people in your life.
  Figure out what is making you miserable and eliminate it from your life.

  Be careful who you disclose your learning disability tosome people are extremely judgmental and hold on to old stereotypes.  Steer clear of these people.
  On a similar note, find a patient and understanding significant other.
  Dont let your piles of paper get out of control!
  Have lots of waste baskets around your house/office.
  Simplify your filing system.
  Do it now or write it down.
  Develop a caffeine habit (although this is controversial).
  Keep your desk clear of clutter.
  Get one of those weekly calendars (like AtaGlance) and write down everything you MUST get done (i.e. class, assignments, etc.).
  Use PostIts, highlighters, Sharpies to make reminders for yourself around the office and home.
  Some people use Marijuana to cope with their ADHD rather than pharmaceuticals.
  If in school, consider using medication (Adderall, Welbutrin, Ritalin, Strattera, Concerta, among others) and see if you qualify for accommodations.
  Get some tutoring.
  Break tasks down into manageable chunks.  So instead of pay bill, you would think of your task as: 1) get bill.  2) get checkbook. 3)get envelope. 4) get stamp. 5)write check. 6)etc.
 Instead of do homework you would think of your task as: 1) get books together. 2) get assignment. 3)open word processor. 4)get internet links 5) turn off internet. 6)write paragraph.
  Homework hack to get started on your homework: make audio recordings of the concepts and then transcribe them.  Voila!  Rough draft!
  1015 minutes of homework, 5 minutes of break. http://e.ggtimer.com or use http://e.ggtimer.com/pomodoro if you can handle 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break.
  Get enough sleep!  Seriously!

20080411 00:16:38 nbsp I didnt like http://www.healthgrades.com/directory_search/physician/profiles/drmdreports/DrStewartTealMDE5FABFF0.cfm this guy at all. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080411 01:04:17 nbsp People need to get over ADD. Its not a valid excuse for being lazy. Its so unbelievably overdiagnosed that perhaps maybe a tenth of those diagnosed with it really have it. Hyperactivity is not synonymous with ADD. Having it doesnt mean that you cant concentrate on things, just that it is harder to concentrate on some things. Drugs are helpful, but not necessary. I have it; I live with it. If you use it as an excuse for something, Im liable to slap you.

 I feel that because these issues are usually just a list of traits that a person may have some of, along with money, to be diagnosed, that the traits should be dealt with individually regardless of diagnosis. I feel that the most good I got out of going to various doctors, regardless of their diagnosis, was that I became able to describe my feelings fairly well.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080411 11:49:13 nbsp No need for violence, William!  No one is saying that ADD is an excuse for being lazy.  However, if not addressed people can suffer some very real consequences (unemployment, drug addiction, getting booted out of school, etc).  All we want to do is create a space for support/discussion and perhaps suggest some coping strategies.  I dont think everyone who has trouble focusing is ADD.  We tend to throw this around and doctors are so quick to diagnose certain people with it.  Hey, you could have ADD OR you could just be a crappy student.  At any rate, we just want to throw up some information and help some people out (and by people I do mean me).  Heh. Users/CurlyGirl26

 William just likes to be a mean conservative.   Also, I might be wrong about the page getting finished.  Since theres so many people with ADD maybe they will all contribute and make something.  I was trying to think of something to contribute but Get adderall isnt very good.  I seriously dont know any good ways to cope with like, not being able to have conversations (even that youre interested in) cause you keep forgetting what you and the other person have said...Users/BradBenedict

20080411 19:09:05 nbsp Radical, this place is already crackling.  I created it some days ago and completely got sidetracked by work that I forgot to add to it. Its nice to see people from all sorts contributing. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080414 16:32:56 nbsp Caffeine may help at times, but youll find yourself needing increasing amounts to do the job.  Or at least thats how it was for me until I realized I had a caffeine addiction back in 1998.  Going cold turkey wasnt as delicious as it sounded... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080415 11:38:37 nbsp Ive actually seen studies where caffeine will make you tired and groggy if you have too much (before it wears off).  I guess its a fine line between the right amount and too much.  I think its even more of a problem if youre already on stimulants.  But if youre already on stimulants you should probably keep an eye on your caffeine intake. Users/BradBenedict

 I wasnt talking about the crash.  I guess its kinda like how stimulants calm down people with ADHD.  But is more than calming down and makes you groggy.  Doesnt makes sense to me. Users/BradBenedict

20080426 18:51:44 nbsp So I dont have medical insurance.  Im wondering if anyone knows a way for me to still get mediciation.  I have the funds to pay for it without insurance, but I dont know many doctors that will work with someone who doesnt have it.  I used to have a doc in Fresno, but dont really have the time to drive all the way down there for that.  Anyone know of someone in town? Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  Go see a doctor at CommuniCare Health Center. They take people without health insurance, no problems. Youll pay for your visit, but it isnt too expensive.  Users/TaniaG
   Thanks for the tip, Users/TaniaG!  I completely forgot about CommuniCare.  Great service! Users/CurlyGirl26
   Awesome!  I know where Ill be going this week.  Thanks so much. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
    Happy to help. :)  Users/TaniaG

20080510 12:41:44 nbsp Never knew this page existed. Anyway, my two cents is to advise an avoidance of Strattera.  While I realize side effects occur to some and not others, my experience was one out of the movie Total Recall ie I became very nervous, looking over my shoulder all the time and thought that the cop were after me etc. Stopped taking after one month, been medication free since. Users/ChrisThompson
 I also found that Ritalin and Adderal sapped my creativity and curiosity. wl

20080604 15:36:20 nbsp My mother was convinced I had ADD simply because I tended to procrastinate on homework.  She basically flatout lied to the doctors about my ability to focus, and every time I told her, Mom, look, Im focusing REALLY WELL, she insisted that one of the symptoms of ADD is hyperfocusing.  (Funny, then, how I hyperfocused on EVERYTHING.)

So she forced me to take the pills.  Between sixth grade and eleventh grade, she had me on Dexedrine, Concerta, Ritalin, and Adderall.  I think it was in that order.  Funny how they made me do worse in school, actually.  But the worst thing was, every single one of them suppressed my appetite.  I was already too skinny (I still am, but Ive put on about fifteen pounds since high school!), but during the times in high school when I took the pills, I never went over 82 pounds; during the times where I managed to avoid them, I even made it up to ninety pounds once.

Use these pills with care, because they are NOT healthy if youre like me. Users/KarinaSummers

20080823 13:55:12 nbsp Also, remember to go on medication vacations.  Times where you dont take your medication to allow your body to relax and not be on edge... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081231 14:09:58 nbsp Anybody know how good the people at Cowell Student Health are at diagnosing ADD? In specific, their GPs? Users/J.D.Penguin

  Back when I was going to school, it was Dr. Joy who was the key person for diagnosis.  As far as being good, he did know the proper amount of medication I would need (which was corroborated with my shrink).  Currently, I believe Dr. Andrews is the lead person and I have no idea if he/she is good or not.  They only ever have one doc do the ADD stuff.  Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  I went once.  The initial person I went to talk to was nice, and reassured me that there were options other than drugs, or that I could go on them once in a great while (rather than twice a day like when I was a kid).  The psychiatrist I talked to wasnt a good listener and told me that lots of students try to get diagnosed as ADD because the pills help everyone focus, not just folks with ADD.  Then she tried to prescribe me pills that werent for ADD instead of rediagnosing me because I wouldnt let her to talk to my parents.  She was a horrible listener.  I stopped going because I felt like she was projecting rather than listening.  I hear they now have actual counselors available instead of only people who just sit there trying to prescribe meds, so thats good.

20081231 17:15:24 nbsp Thanks Sunjeet...yea, I was referring to Dr. Andrews...Im not sure how he is...I was trying to get a referral to a shrink here in Davis, but they said I needed to see him first before I could get referred and covered by SHIP. So well see what happens. Users/J.D.Penguin

20090312 18:58:01 nbsp the wiki is the devil when it comes to procrastinating. How do you think i got here?  Users/EricaMacGregor

20110313 10:56:37 nbsp Driven to Distraction is based on the premise that medicating is the only answer. Users/Angel.York

20110527 00:11:36 nbsp Ive been disappointed in the lack of ADHD support at UCD. There are no ADHDspecialist counselors, no support groups, and no workshops that Ive been able to find. The psychiatrist I saw at the student health center was incredibly condescending, misleading, and wasnt too knowledgeable about ADHD treatment. Maybe I was been spoiled by my undergraduate institution (large public east coast university) and I have unreasonable expectations. Maybe UCD has just dropped the ball on this. I dont know.

After years of trying (and hating) stimulants, Im selftreating by eating well, staying physically active, trying my best to get creative about scheduling, and drinking Red Bulls. Its incredibly imperfect, but its the best I can do for now.  Users/AsmaMaryamMohseni

20111031 12:07:19 nbsp Word to all the posters who mentioned the lack of support for those with ADHD.  They think that if they throw pills at the problem then its dealt with like youre an old sofa or something.  But nay!  I would also say that they lack good assistance for undergrads with ADHD and dyslexia.  Now talk about being effed with from both ends! Users/AshleyHamidi

Hey....Some of us like ADHD treatment.  Some of need it!!! Judgy wudgy....You presumed too much...If you really are Ashley Hamidi.....Curly
