The AJD Angels of Hope is a nonprofit organizations nonprofit charity organization. It was was an idea by 14yearold 9th grader, Girl Scout Alicia Demaree (AJD) who visited her mothers heritage the Philippines in 2009. She felt devastated watching the poor children in the street and how they lived their life in poverty. She asked her mother who was an immigrant to US to send her own clothes and toys to help the children in the Philippines after giving the street children all her snacks and candies she kept at her backpack. When they came back to US, they thought of making this idea a reality. AJD Angels of Hope Foundation was born on May 2010 and was incorporated at the State of California by August 3, 2010.
