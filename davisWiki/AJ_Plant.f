Albert June Plant (18591911) was an early Davis resident who helped establish the town; he served as secretary for the first Davisville Chamber of Commerce as well as for the State Farm Promotion Committee.  He was very concerned with local affairs, and along with George Pierce, shared an adamant passion to see the University Farm placed in Davisville.  As the son of local settler LJ Plant, Albert was a Davisville native who lived in the area for most of his life, although he left briefly for schooling in Sacramento and San Francisco.  By 1886 he had come back to Davisville, where he worked as a bookkeeper for Liggett and Drummonds General Store.  He formed the Plant Grain and Warehouse business around 1905.  From 1907 to 1908, he was also a Justice of the Peace. He was married to Marry Ellen Borchers in 1888 and had four children with her, one of whom was FA Plant. In adulthood FA Plant would, like his father, come to have an important role in Davis city government.

AJ Plants former home, located at 221 1st Street, is a Historic Places City Merit Resource that currently serves as a private residence.
