20130607 12:51:34 nbsp Im sorry. But this just smacks of a pure advertisement. I dont understand how the DavisWiki differentiates this from commercialization and its community mission. Print this in the Enterprise. I have been criticized for puffery and bloated content before. Whats with this? Comments welcome. Users/fknochenhauer

20130613 08:20:40 nbsp fknochenhauer: My name is Dmitriy, I am the manager of AMD Medical Supply here in Davis. Our DavisWiki page is not designed to be a pure advertisement. Its purpose is to be informative for Davis residents. Our page is very community oriented and serves a clear community mission: we are the ONLY medical supply store in Davis and we exist and strive to improve the health and wellbeing of our customers in Davis. Thus far, we have only heard positive feedback regarding our mission. I know that medical supply stores have opened in Davis in the past  but all unfortunately closed their doors very soon. I believe this can be attributed to a number of reasons, one of which is a very high cost of rent. Thankfully, with the support of our Davis community we have remained open for over 1 year and plan to stay in Davis for years to come. We opened our Davis store based on a  very much vocalized demand  we had many Davis residents driving all the way out to our store in Sacramento to purchase medical supplies and personally asked that we open a store in Davis. Because my family and I are originally from Yolo County and have deep roots in Davis over 40 years old, we felt that we needed to help Davis residents in need of medical supplies. In opening a medical supply store in Davis, our goal was that residents could have their own, local, friendly, and high quality medical supply store and enjoy this convenience. Prior to our opening, the nearest medical supply store was in Woodland or in Sacramento. It is terrible that our city did not have its own permanent medical supply store prior to our opening. We have a huge medical community with a top hospital, clinics, providers, care homes, caregivers, and students studying to give back professionally to our community  all residing in Davis and serving a large elderly population. It is unfortunate that you so strongly oppose our information being available to those who need it on DavisWiki, however I hope that my short explanation will help you to understand our sincere purpose in serving our Davis community.

20130905 17:35:15 nbsp Beware: this store does not give refunds.  Yes, it says so on your receipt and there is a discreet little disclaimer on the wall next to the cash register.  It would be good business, however, to let the customer know this verbally.  It isnt like there is ever a long line. It never occurred to me that I could not return something that was totally unused (purchased only two hours previously)and not a medically sensitive device.  I was able to exchange the device for another product  so what is the difference?  they still took the first product back.  It also took the clerk several minutes and a calculator to figure out that there was one dollar difference in the price.  It will definitely be the last time I purchase anything from them.
