The SacramentoDavis Chapter of Amigos de las Americas (AMIGOS) is a nonprofit organizations nonprofit organization that trains local young adults to serve as AMIGOS Volunteer Opportunities Volunteers in Latin America. Starting each August, the SacramentoDavis Chapter offers in depth Informational Meetings about the operations of the chapter and the summer projects. What does the Training Program involve? How does the chapter support the volunteers and their families? Anyone is invited to come!

They hold interviews with all serious applicants. These are short, required sessions designed to help the Volunteers and their families get to know the staff and board and vice versa. They want to make sure that all prospective Volunteers and their families are aware of the commitment and that the minimum requirements are met. These take place after every Informational Meeting for your convenience.
