All units, except SAREP (which is moving to central campus), moved on November 6, 2013 to the new location of UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Agriculture and Natural Resources located at 2801 Second Street, Davis, CA 95618.

The address(ANR Building, 38.53765510653747, 121.79089307785034) (often referred for historical reasons as the DANR Building) is part of the west campus, located on 225 Hopkins Road between Hutchison Drive and Bee Biology Road, near the University Airport.  The building was named such because it houses offices for University of California UC Agriculture and Natural Resources Agriculture and Natural Resources, which used to call itself the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, but opted to drop Division from the name several years ago.  In many publications, the building is still referred to as DANR, but in newer publications the D has been dropped and the building is called ANR.

The building was arranged in two wings, with the administrative departments in the south (left) wing and the program offices (4H and SAREP) in the west (right) wing.  In the middle there are two conference rooms; the Plum Room and the Olive Room, as well as a kitchen and restrooms.

The DANR Building has its own parking lot, which because of its funding sources, is not tappable by TAPS.  However, due to its remote location, this is not very useful to most people trying to avoid paying for parking on campus.

The DANR Building is not to be confused with the DANR Lab, which is located near Hoagland Hall.
