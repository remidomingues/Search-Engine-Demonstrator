20130206 00:47:16 nbsp I logged back into my davis wiki account just to comment on my recent experience with Aaron and APEX :D. My bike actually fell apart (crapped out is more accurate) on me after I got out of work on a Friday in front of the Bike Barn. The wheel practically popped off the back, gears wear jammed, and a spoke broke during the entire ordeal. I brought it to the bike barn to reattach my wheel and get a quote for basic repairs to get it running again. They quoted me for something around 8090 dollars.

I decided to push my bike all the way down town to APEX, since I had heard many great things about it. Aaron was very busy, but he took my bike and told me he could have my bike ready by the following Thursday. I ended up picking it up the following Friday, and he replaced my spokes, brakes, brake cable, realigned my tires, and did some other basic maintenance stuff and only charged ~$45 for everything (including labor). My bike now runs even better than when I got it (its completely silent when I ride it!) Users/Jennyfish

20130207 17:44:29 nbsp My husband and I brought our bikes in for tuneups in December.

This is the only bike shop I have ever used that did not bother to call me to notify me that our bikes were ready. The owner told me they would be ready Wednesday or Thursday. He failed to mention that he would be leaving town on Thursday and planned to close his shop down for a week, during the holiday. So even though after the fact he claimed the bikes were ready for pickup the Wednesday before Christmas, we werent able to get our bikes back for a another 8 days, or about 2 weeks after the day we brought them in.

But what made me truly dissatisfied was the way the owner handled the situation. He wanted to place the blame on me. His attitude was I should have known to pick up our bikes. He said he had told us he would be away, but he never said anything about it. If he had told us I wouldnt have wasted my time by going to his shop twice, in person, leaving voicemails on the store phone, to no avail. I dont like lies, and I dont like excuses. The customer is not always right, but when the owner is in the wrong and doesnt own up to it, thats a red flag.

I am giving 2 stars, rather than 1, because the work on the bikes themselves was fine. Users/AliH

  I apologize for any misunderstanding, and Im glad that your bikes are running well, but I stated to you on the phone and in person when you were dropping off the bikes that any bikes dropped off needed to be picked up by that following Weds because I was going out of town for the Holidays. I know I told you this, because I told EVERY customer who called or walked in since the beginning of December that I was going out of town for the Holiday break and wouldnt be back for over a week.  This was a courtesy that I gave to all my customers. EVERYONE ELSE picked their bikes up on time or made arrangements to get them after break except you. When we spoke on the phone on the Monday prior to their due date of Weds to discuss if you wanted to get the recommended new parts or not, you asked when they would be done.  I again stated that they would be ready on Weds, and that you had to get them otherwise I would be gone for vacation.  I stayed open 3 hours later than normal that Weds for people to come by and grab their bikes if needed. I am sorry that no one was at the shop when you came during our vacation or that no one was there to answer the phone while we were closed.  When I got back into internet and cell coverage, I did reply to your emails almost instantly. No lies.  You missed your pickup window and were without your bike longer than you had planned for and youre mad about it.  I understand that.  For that I am sorry, but if I tell you your bike is ready on a particular day, come pick up your bike on that day or call to check on its status.  Thats what most people would do. But if you remember, when you came to pick it up, I did apologize for the miscommunication for which you gave me lots of attitude.  Attitude that was unwarranted for something that was as much your fault as mine.  You made your point of that you were unhappy with not having your bike, but rather than letting it go and realizing that you too could have done things to prevent any miscommunication, youd rather put all the blame on me and post up a negative review almost 2 months later. Like you said, customers are NOT always right, and am more than happy to take the blame when it is warranted, but this is not one of those times. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20130422 11:53:51 nbsp My experience with Apex was excellent. My wife bought two tuneups through Groupon, so I was sorta expecting the bare minimum from them. But no! Aaron was awesome and still went the extra mile with us. He was very pleasant and helpful on top of doing a great job on our bikes. Mine rides like it is new again. My wife had an issue with her gears, and he replaced a part for no additional labor cost (even though he had every right to!). This guy is very honest, knowledgeable, and hardworking, so I would highly recommend him (take advantage of any Groupon deals that may come up again!!). Users/heymaestro

20130424 10:05:09 nbsp I am not a formal bike mechanic but I have been working on MTBs as a hobby since the 80s. Between my bikes and my friends bikes I must have several hundred hours of wrenching under my belt. That said there are still times when I need help. Chasing threads, frame realignment, pressing bearing cups etc. When I lived in the Bay Area my go to guy was Chris Robinson, an ex 7/11 mechanicowner of Robinsons Wheelworks. Knowing a real expert and getting real expert advice is critical when things get tough. (This is even more important if your ride cost as much as a cheapo car......).

That said, I ran into trouble on a complicated matter, threading a treadless steerer tube.

I contacted numerous shops in Davis and Sacramento. Only one shop was capaBLe of this task and they assured me no problem, quoted a reasonable price  and even guarantied the delivery date. Well this did not pan out, in fact after they jacked up the cost to do my request, I was then told my idea was impossible and multiple excuses were then thrown out to full discourage me from even attempting my wild idea.

Because the information being fed to me seemed to make no sense, I decided to bug Aaron at Apex with my trivial dilemma. He assured me that it was indeed trivial amd knowing that I was in a jam, Aaron said come on in. Within 45 minutes he did what I was told was IMPOSSIBLE. I suppose that given what I was told at the other shop, Aaron can perform miracles!!!!!!!!!!!

Heres my recommendation of Apex  Cycles
Knowledge: A+
Ability: A+
Honesty: A+

20130609 11:00:02 nbsp This place is the best. The owner was very helpful and thorough. I really appreciated all their help. I will definitely be returning to this shop again. Users/JustinWoo

20130710 00:47:45 nbsp Aaron is a master at his craft a wonderful mechanic and business owner. Customer serviceis 5 star Users/bcartoscelli

20131019 00:23:41 nbsp Im not one to write strong reviews but the truth needs to be told  THERE IS NOT ONE REDEEMING FACTOR ABOUT THIS PLACE. I had to go in 3 different times just to get a simple bike tune up (that was not done well at all). The owner, Aaron, said they would have my bike ready by Tuesday but when I went in that day, I was told that they had not even started working on my bike yet. He said it would be done by the end of the day but when I went back, I ended up having to wait even longer for his assistant to finish changing my tube. As Im biking off, I notice that THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS  my headset was still out of alignment (& this was the key concern I had pointed, and he had ensured would get fixed).

To top things off, the customer service is TERRIBLE. It is basic salesmanship etiquette to inform customers beforehand if you are going to charge them an additional fee PRIOR to doing it. Instead, Aaron just casually slipped it in as I was leaving, that I would need to pay for the two tubes he had installed. If he had at least told me before putting the tubes in that it would incur an additional fee, I would have been fine with it. However, he mentioned nothing about paying more until after he already installed the tubes. To top it off, when I was tried to point out the fact that he should have asked me before charging me, he got all defensive and tried to make it seem like I was the one being irrational. (Reading other reviews here make it seem like Im not the only one who had an issue with him in this respect).

Long (& frustrating) story short:
No sense of customer service or sense of salesmanship
Took 3 separate trips just to get a tuneup done (and it was NOT done very well either)
NEVER coming back here again.  Users/Leesa

  Always 2 sides to every story.  Heres mine. Leaving a negative review the day after I call you to remind you to pick up the tire you had me special order and pay for or exchange the tubes I installed on your bike in your original tune up.  Yes, your bike was not done when you came in Tuesday morning to get it even though it was promised for 4pm in the afternoon.  And when you came back in the afternoon, you did have to wait 5 minutes for your bike because it went flat again after airing it up during your tune up.  You needed it to get to class so we replaced your old leaking 650c tube with a new one while you waited.  Before you went out the door, I mentioned that due to the side of your tire bulging out that you needed a new tire and that it was most likely the cause for your recent flats.  You had me order you a tire and I said I would just add the cost of the tubes (the one you watched me replace, and the one I replaced during your tune up) when you picked up the tire.  You then insisted that there should be no extra charge due to the coupon you used for your tune up.  I explained that I wasnt charging you an additional fee, I was charging you for the tubes.  Logically, I cant give away parts for free and that the coupon was good for labor only, not parts.  We went back and forth about this to the point of you pulling up the coupon on your phone only to realize that you misunderstood the coupon.  I apologized that I didnt call you to get permission to replace your tube, but Ive NEVER had anyone not want their bike rideable and was surprised that you were making such a big deal over me replacing such an integral piece to making your bike ridable.  Your headset wasnt out of alignment, your stem was slightly askew.  This was my mistake as I thought I had straightened it, but it was still slightly off.  Time goes by, I called you again to remind you that your tire had come in and that you still owed for the tubes and gave you the option of bringing me replacement tubes since you said that I shouldnt have replaced them without your consent because you might have had tubes at home.  You then stated that you no longer wanted the tire I special ordered for you (650c, odd size) and got noticeably frustrated that you couldnt  settle your tab for 2 tubes online.  I stated I could ring you up over the phone and email you a receipt, but you insisted on coming in to settle up Saturday or Monday.  For the record, as of Wednesday you still havent come in to pay your bill.  Then today, (Thursday), you called to bargain with me after consulting with your friends that since you only saw me replace one tube that you only felt obligated to pay for that one, but still had not done so.  I stated that at his point I had written you off as that customer that just skipped on their bill and that it wasnt worth my time to pursue you over 2 tubes.  But after careful consideration, its a matter of principle.  Please bring me 2 tubes or pay your tab.  Otherwise I will be forced to move forward with legal action.  You are not the first student to skip out on a bill, only the first to do it with such disregard.

Long (& VERY Frustrating) Story Short:
 Came to pick up bike and got mad it wasnt done even though you showed up 5 hours early
 Was mistaken about what coupon covered and when proven wrong, got frustrated that parts were not included
 Was given option to exchange tubes or pay, has yet to do either

20131209 11:35:41 nbsp Hours may be loose. If you need a part at 11am sharp, call ahead. Users/ScottB

20140606 09:54:17 nbsp What can I say, this place is the best.  I always get great service and sound advice. Apex is my go to shop for repairs and service on all my family bikes.  Users/DagonJones
