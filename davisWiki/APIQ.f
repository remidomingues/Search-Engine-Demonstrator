APIQ (Asian & PacificIslander Queers) is a nonprofit student organizations student organization at UC Davis founded in 1999. Our mission is to provide a safe, confidential space for students who identify as both API (Asian and/or PacificIslander) and LGBTQQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Queer, Intersex, Asexual).

Many of our events are open to the community, regardless of ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity, or age. We hope to enrich and educate all students in the UC Davis community who are interested in queer and API issues, whether or not they identify as API and/or queer. APIQ holds a variety of meetings and events throughout the year such as socials, discussions, and workshops where we explore important topics like identity, coming out, health, and politics. At the same time, we encourage strong bonds and friendships, and many consider APIQ as a second family.

General Meetings

In general, APIQ meets every Thursday from 7pm to 9pm at the Student Community Center, in Meeting Room D. The time/location is subject to change, however, so please keep an eye out for changes! Meeting information (topics, times, location), socials, events, and various updates will be posted on our Tumblr and Facebook regularly and announced through our mailing list (send an email if youre interested in being added).

If you are thinking of joining APIQ, we welcome new members to every meeting, so feel free to come any time. Meetings are also open unless otherwise specified, so you do not have to identify as queer or API to attend. Please Please don’t be shy to come alone!

Our meetings are not mandatory, so come whenever you have time. The topics of our meetings vary quarter to quarter and year to year. If you have any questions or concerns regarding APIQ, please feel free to send us an email.

Annual Event Examples
  Dodgeball in the Wellman Pit: Each year, sometimes multiple times APIQ hosts a large dodgeball game in the Wellman pit in place of a regular meeting.
  Assassins: An intense game, played outside of regular APIQ meetings, in which players must eliminate assigned targets through in an effort to eventually become the last surviving player. Do you have what it takes to be on top?
