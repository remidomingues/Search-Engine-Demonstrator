 Current Classes and Programs 

 The Hapkido Program at the ARC 
Hapkido is reasonably well known system of Korean martial arts.  It places more emphasis on weapons, selfdefense and joint locks.  The strikes are pretty much derived from Tae Kwon Do.  Its a nice introductory class to martial arts if youre just looking for something basic to try out.  I say this because it places more emphasis on basic selfdefense techniques more so than the other classes.
The instructor, Robert Sarason Robert Sarason Sabunim has been teaching Hapkido at UC Davis for over 30 years.  He is a very friendly guy and you can always recognize him by his long, curly hair.

 The Davis Judo Team 
World renowned system of self defense, Olympic sport, traditional Japanese Martial Art practiced worldwide by women and men, young and old.  A complete Judo program is now available under the expert instruction of Harry Kendall Sensei that begins with the basic techniques of falling, throwing and grappling (which includes arm locks and chokes) and culminates, for those who show the competency, with enrollment in intercollegiate level, and nationally ranked tournaments.  Women and men of all sizes are encouraged to try this dynamic sport and discover the principles, techniques and spirit of this popular Martial Art.

 The Judo Class at the ARC 
Judo, which is translated as the gentle way, teaches the principle of flexibility in the application of throwing, grappling, learning how to fall, and submission technique, developed from Jujitsu. In the Judo class students will learn how to give way, rather than use force, to overcome a stronger opponent.  The efficient use of balance, leverage, and movement are the essence of Judo. The student will learn Kodokan Judo etiquette, terminology, techniques, selfconfidence, concentration, and leadership skills, as well as physical coordination, power, and flexibility. Student completing the class will be welcomed to any Dojo as a valuable new member.

 The Aikido Program at the ARC 
Aikido is a modern interpretation of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daitōryū_Aikijūjutsu DaitoRyu Aikijujutsu, the openhanded fighting art of the Samurai. Aikidos founder, Morihei Ueshiba, transformed this efficient and brutal combat style (bujutsu) into a method for controlling and developing the self (budo) and creating peace. In Aikido class, we study basic movements (kihon dosa) and weapons techniques (buki waza) to learn to control our bodies. We then apply the lessons of kihon doza and buki waza in basic techniques with partner (sotai dosa kihon waza) to learn to take advantage of body mechanics and our partners energy to neutralize attacks. We practice joint locks, pins throws, weapons techniques (tanto, bokken, jo), and breaking our fall. Aikido is for all! There are no competitions with others; the only person you compete with is yourself. In class, we collaborate to deepen our understanding of this art.

 Brazilian JiuJitsu at the ARC 
The class focuses on learning and applying fundamental techniques of Brazilian JiuJitsu. Students practice various techniques using a traditional Gi, also known as a kimono.  Students learn and practice advanced sweeps, submissions, escapes and counters, how to reverse an attacker and how to force their opponent into submission. Detailed instruction in technique, specific drilling, and position advancement are the main focus of this class. Competition is encouraged, but not required.

 Submission Grappling at the ARC 
The class is based on techniques of traditional Brazilian JiuJitsu, and the fundamental principles remain the same. Adjustments are made to compensate for the lack of a uniform to hold on to. In Submission Grappling you learn a whole new set of grips. The wrists, back of the neck, ankle, knee and elbow grips are all different than traditional Gi grips. Students learn takedowns, positions, transitions, escapes, reversals and how to apply and defend against joint locks, chokes and other submission holds.

 Mixed Martial Arts 
The Mixed Martial Arts class is designed for everyone. The class will teach you the basic techniques of MMA: Standup, Wrestling and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. The focus is on the ground fighting aspect of MMA. Students will learn how to take an opponent down as well as how to apply basic brazilian jiu jitsu moves while avoiding or blocking punches and kicks. This is not a full contact Mixed Martial Arts class, and sparring will only be allowed in a controlled  manner.

 Previously Offered Classes and Programs 
 The Sanshou Kickboxing Program at the ARC 
Sanshou Kickboxing is FreeForm version of Chinese Kickboxing.  It was developed in the 1950s as a way to unify all the Kung Fu schools in China under one set of rules.  It comprises of punches, kicks, knees, and throws.  There is a lot of freedom to do what you want except that you have gloves on.  These classes are the only actual kickboxing school in Davis.  Also be aware that this is not merely an Aerobics aerobics class.  Expect to get worked out, hard.

 The Tae Kuk Mu Sul Program at the ARC 
This Martial Art is a traditional form of Korean Martial Arts based on a very complex pressure point system.  It can be described as a mix of Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido.  Although the striking is derived from TKD and some of the pressure points and locks are from Hapkido, it is very much its own unique style.   A free uniform is included.  This is the only TKMS school in Davis.
The instructor, Grandmaster Suk Ku Kim is the founder and grandmaster of TKMS. You can learn almost anything you ever wanted to learn (except the ability to fly) from Master Kim.  You can learn everything from selfdefense, weapons, pressure points, TKD Olympic sparring, TKD, forms, just a plethora of knowledge from a Grandmaster. Master Kim is also a ranked Master in Tae Kwon Do (9th), Hapkido (6th), Kuk Sul Won (6th) and an 8th degree in TKMS.

  Ive seen him do some crazy stuff like flip someone completely over by using a fan.
   This doesnt seem possible  Users/JackHaskel JH
   http://www.ebudokai.com/hibuki/tessen.htm also recall the fight scene at the end of Disneys Mulan...  Users/StephanieStudebaker
   Fans are actually very common in Japanese and Korean martial arts systems.  They were developed for Geishas to defend themselves.  Users/RawiNanakul RN
   You can do pretty much anything with the proper force and leverage, and I suspect the body motion of the person being flipped also contributes to the ease or difficulty with which the feat is performed.  Users/TusharRawat TR
   It was probably a pressure point demonstration; the right points can cause a spasm which is capable of forcing a reasonably fit person to throw themselves to the ground involuntarily, with very little force applied.  It is a Hapkido technique.  Users/gregpera

 The Kung Fu (Northern Shaolin) Program at the ARC 
Kung fu is a Chinese tradition whose roots reach back thousands of years.  Developed as a method of maintaining health and defending the students selves and country, Kung Fu remains a popular practice today. The Northern Siu Lum (beishaolin in Mandarin) system of kung fu stresses long and short range leg and hand techniques. Takedowns and joint locks are also practiced. This class focuses on basics, coordination, fitness, and techniques for application. Later on, forms are taught as a source of
techniques, concepts, and an expression of the art in Kung Fu.

The class is taught by Thomas Renshaw,  a student of Grandmaster Wing Lam. While at Lam Kwoon (Lams Kung Fu school), Thomas instructed beginning to advanced level students, represented Lam Kwoon at tournaments, and was part of the Wing Lam Kung Fu demo team. He also structured and taught a championproducing childrens kung fu program at Lam Kwoon in Sunnyvale, CA.
