The ARC Martial Arts Room is one of three activity rooms on the second floor of the UC Davis Activities and Recreation Center. It is located just left of the buildings east hallway and has large glass windows facing onto the hallways. The other two group activity rooms are the ARC Group Exercise Room and the ARC Dance Room.

The ARC Martial Arts Room is used by the ARC Martial Arts Program, official UCD Intramural Sports & Sport Clubs Sports Clubs, SPAC Student Organizations clubs, informal student groups and the PE Department. Some simply like to watch some of the amazing, spectacular and grueling martial arts activities, but it is even more fun to take part in the action!
