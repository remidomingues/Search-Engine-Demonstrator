20090806 22:26:28 nbsp A slightly belated welcome to the wiki. Thanks for posting the note about construction of West Village. Since the news on the official UC Davis website is two years old, I was wondering about an update. Ill try to get out there and take some pictures. Users/robinlaughlin

20090810 05:13:36 nbsp Hey, Arwmenn... I integrated your comment on the Scooter Cop entry.  Several people just like you wrote the entry, and you should feel free to edit it directly, adding your information and views on things.  That applies across the entire wiki. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100523 00:19:35 nbsp I dont think I could have finished two of those when I was swimming and lifting several times a week in high school. Pretty amazing. Users/hankim

20100523 00:28:27 nbsp I have been on a cut for about a few weeks for a Judo tournament and that burger looks so amazing right now... Users/hankim

20100523 11:28:24 nbsp How long was the sitting? Users/JenniferCook

20100523 15:34:19 nbsp ?!?!?!?!

Is that even possible?? I think we need a wiki event at Guad to see you do it again. Users/JenniferCook
  I agree, and we will tape it this time. Users/hankim
   Alright, its official, then. When should we all show up? Maybe the next Wiki BBQ can be at Guad :P Users/JenniferCook

20100523 19:59:59 nbsp good god that was Fall 2006... Im not sure Id ever want to do that again.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

  You will succumb to our peer pressure! Users/hankim

20100529 09:09:53 nbsp Thanks for being willing to try... Im betting that you dont get a response though. Users/JasonAller

20100604 12:38:10 nbsp With changing the redirect on UC, you may want to check the links to the page and ensure that they dont need to be altered to UC Davis.  Most of them already seem to be University System appropriate. Users/TomGarberson

20100605 22:29:18 nbsp It would appear that you are correct, and Ill put it back if you have not already. Users/MasonMurray

20100615 16:01:16 nbsp Pretty good disclaimer on Plainfield Station.  Personally, I like it.  Then again, its the kind of place I grew up eating at.  Rural (actually island, which is similar) places where you get a paper plate loaded with really good food and a wooden bench to eat at.  I have no problem eating from a stall at a fish market, but have been amused by how horrified some people are.  Different comfort zones. Users/JabberWokky

20101204 18:51:52 nbsp During the 29 years of operations, LEHR generated and disposed of radioactive, biologic, and chemical wastes, as well as municipal and lab wastes. Dogs were buried onsite in the early years. Later the dog carcasses were shipped to Hanford for disposal. Approximately 35,000 gallons of sludge effluent (dog feces) contaminated with strontium90 was disposed of in underground concrete banks. The site was also used by the university as a landfill area for residential and laboratory waste disposal from the late 1940s to 1967. (Source: http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/nplsnl/n0904786.pdf)

Im just working with what the sources say. The EPA refers to the whole area as in, the building/landfill as the site therefore they do not differentiate in the manner that you do. If have insider knowledge as to where the beagles were buried in the early 1960s, then by all means, please feel free to add specifics.  But please dont delete relevant data such as the fact that they were later shipped to Hanford.

20101204 23:22:34 nbsp Its all pretty confusing. Whenever I read anything about CHE, LEHR, and UC Davis Landfill, they all seem to refer to the same 15 acre tract of land. If this is the case, then, in the broad sense, there are simply active and inactive parts of the same area with the radioactive parts being blocked off. The EPA lists this region 9 superfund as being a full 15 acres. The offical superfund name is LEHR/Old Campus Landfill so there should be reference to this on the UC Davis landfill entry even if they are technically separated.    Users/ScottMeehleib

20101204 23:29:40 nbsp I guess what Im trying to say is, how do you know that they are totally unrelated facilities?  Users/ScottMeehleib

20101205 00:05:54 nbsp Okay, I think I finally understand what you are saying now. I somehow missed the fact that the newer landfill is located on a totally different area of campus. I guess I got thrown off by the fact that they are both apparently about 15 acres big and both technically campus dumps. Thanks for the headsup and sorry for the confusion on my part. Users/ScottMeehleib

20101205 00:47:14 nbsp Wow! Cool summer job that Im sure gave you a unique perspective of the campus. Im always very interested to hear more about the quirks and oddities about the university. Users/ScottMeehleib

20101231 15:16:32 nbsp Your edit on Amtrak policies reminds me of a UCD matter when about 15 years ago I was a pedestrian over the crest of the Richards Blvd. bridge with an attache cell phone looking toward a UCD building.  A policeman was concerned that I might be taking a picture.  When I told him that I wanted to get to the Amtrak station, he offered to give me a ride, but that I would have to put my cell phone in the trunk.  I declined. Users/BruceHansen

20110107 23:21:32 nbsp Thanks for figuring out the correct name for the new Days Inn.  It just didnt seem likely to me that UC Davis was in the name. Users/CovertProfessor

20110110 10:21:24 nbsp Thanks for your work on California Northern Railroad Company. Users/BruceHansen

20110126 21:38:18 nbsp You did some editing on University Departments.  I was wondering if you thought a page on department names such as I mentioned at University Departments/Talk would be useful or a good idea. Users/BruceHansen

20110321 12:41:48 nbsp we could have easily removed our wiki to get rid of the whole thing. but no, we stand by our reputation and believe its important to do so.
if you look underneath her story, she was given an invite to email detail. You are right It might hve been a bit more effective to have written an invite
but I was working, 3 drivers gone for break, and she had finals. So you have a point, but I did offer several times for her to forward more info in consideration
that it was finals. thanks for your criticism i hope it will help.  Users/DavidPlacencia

20110321 18:24:17 nbsp Please see the Wiki Community/Accusations/Talk page. Users/WesP

So when is the Ban JoshLawson page gonna happen? HAHA, Pathetic...... Users/JoshLawson

20110430 13:57:08 nbsp Hey, thanks for adding to my page Railfanning :) Users/Chelsea744

20110531 08:38:52 nbsp Youre right  I got confused in the course of all the edits. Users/CovertProfessor

20111119 17:49:58 nbsp Do you have evidence that the protesters were told they were going to be peppersprayed?  Also, did you see http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us9thcircuit/1332957.html this link to a 9th Circuit ruling that use of pepper spray on nonviolent protestors is excessive use of force? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20111119 17:58:33 nbsp I worked around and with the UCDPD in prior campus protests (mrak hall, etc...). The standard procedure I observed was the senior officer present (in this case Lt Pike) would stand in front of the offending protesters and explain the consequences for not dispersing before proceeding with arrests. Though I was not present, it seems the video conveniently starts recording just before the spraying took place. I am certain the prior one or two minutes of video would show this. Well never see it though.  Users/ARWENNHOLD
