The Associated Students, University of California, Davis (ASUCD) is a term describing the undergraduates undergraduate student government at UCD. All undergraduate students are duespaying members of ASUCD, grad students can also elect to join but rarely do. Unlike most other UC student governments, ASUCD is not affiliated with UCSA The University of California Student Association (UCSA). ASUCD officially disaffiliated from UCSA on November 2nd, 2006.

Most often, the phrase ASUCD is used to describe the governing body of ASUCD.  Similar to wiki:WikiPedia:United_States_government the US government, ASUCD has an Executive, a Legislative, and a Judicial branch. The associations $11.1 million dollar operational ASUCD Budget budget funds a host of student services such as Unitrans, KDVS, the Coffee House, Campus Copies and Classical Notes, the Bike Barn, and the Experimental College. A fundamental characteristic of ASUCD is that it is primarily student managed and staffed, employing upwards of 1,500 students (not to mention dishing out a few scholarships like the ASUCD Prizes). ASUCD offers opportunities to engage in leadership activities that range from student advocacy to management and finance and to event planning.  Senate meetings are open to the public, and held every Thursday during the school year, in the Student Community Center, Meeting Room D, starting at 6:10pm.

ASUCD is a taxexempt 501(c)3 NonProfit Organizations nonprofit organization.  Their taxexempt status got them in a bit of trouble in 2004 due to candidate endorsements (see Lamargate).

ASUCD has an http://asucd.ucdavis.edu official website which includes the http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/government/govdocuments/ ASUCD Constitution, from which some of the following information is robbed.

 Executive 

The current sitting ASUCD President President is Armando Figueroa.
  The President, as the chief executive officer of ASUCD, oversees all ASUCD units. She has the option to sign or veto all legislation passed by the ASUCD Senate.
  Advocacy Units are directly under the executive, and include among others Lobby Corps and ASUCD University Affairs.
  The ASUCD President does not have the ability to introduce legislation, except for the annual budget. They are also responsible for appointing the directors of all ASUCD units except for the The California Aggie and KDVS, which are appointed by the Campus Media Board.

The current sitting ASUCD Vice President Vice President is Maxwell Kappes.
  The Vice President is elected with the President and serves as the presiding officer over all ASUCD Senate meetings.  They are also the legal successor to the ASUCD Presidency.

The current sitting ASUCD Controller Controller is Rylan Schaeffer.

  The President is in charge of appointing an ASUCD Controller, who must be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate. The Controller is the Chief Operations Officer of ASUCD, and oversees business units along with the Business Manager.  The official duties of the controller are: working on all phases of management planning, budgeting, implementation, and evaluating. In addition, they monitor the expenses of all AS activities.

ASUCD has three units which deal with external issues.  The director of the ASUCD City/County Affairs Office is Jeanna Gindi. The director of the ASUCD University Affairs ASUCD University Affairs Office is currently vacant.  The director of Lobby Corps is Bihter Ozedirne.  (Unlike other schools, there is no ASUCD External Vice President.)

The ASUCD President and ASUCD Vice President Vice President are elected together during the 7^th^ Week of Winter Quarter each year using Instant Runoff Voting, for a term of one year. To be eligible for the ASUCD Presidency, one must have completed 60 units (not necessarily at Davis) and have been a registered UC Davis student for at least two quarters prior to election.

The Executive Office of the ASUCD President and the ASUCD Cabinet provides assistance and counsel to the ASUCD President.

 Legislative 
 Senate 
There are 12 seats on the ASUCD Senate.  They are elected six at a time during the 7th Week of Fall Quarter and the 7th Week of Winter Quarter using Choice Voting.  Many of the Senators are most visible as candidates (often in Slate slates), but spend most of the year writing and reviewing legislation.  Senators may additionally tackle any kind of goal, from fighting racial discrimination to getting staplers in the computer labs  the fact that they are Senators opens many doors in the UCD Administration and the City of Davis that ordinarily would be hard to access. There is an ASUCD Senate Office that serves as a working place for Senators.

Current Fall Term Senators:
  Gareth Smythe
  Janesh Gupta
  Jonathan Mitchell
  Katherine Sherman Katie Sherman
  Mariah Kala Watson
  Shehzad Lokhandwalla

Current Winter Term Senators:
  Azka Fayyaz
  Artem Senchev
  Amelia Helland
  Robyn Huey
  Nicholas Sanchez
  Eugenia Chung

 Commissions 
Commissions play an integral role in the ASUCD Senate.  Some are programmatic, and do outreach activities, but all of them help in crafting legislation at least occasionally.  There are seven of them, vaguely described in the Constitution as follows:
  1. Academic Affairs Commission  Current Chair: Dana Sever. Recommends to ASUCD programs and policies in Academic Affairs areas. Disseminates information concerning the student development of courses and curriculum. They honor teachers that go above and beyond each year. Meeting Times: Monday at 7:10 in the Mee Room of the MU.
  2. Internal Affairs Commission  Current Chair: Spencer McManus. Investigates and recommends improvements in areas and services which affect the quality of student life. Orchestrates administrative plans for all ASUCD units and reviews legislation for anything internal, i.e. delegating campus affairs. Meeting Times: Monday at 5:10 in the Mee Room of the MU.
  3. Business and Finance Commission  Current Chair: Zach Griffiths. Formally advises ASUCD Senate Senate on fiscal concerns and financial allocations. Meeting Times: Tuesday at 7:10 in the Mee Room of the MU
  4. External Affairs Commission  Current Chair: Amy Ly. Acts as liaison with offcampus bodies which affect students. Works with Executive office and Senate to recommend action for city, county and national affairs. Meeting Times: Tuesday at 5:10 in the Mee Room of the MU.

  Commission chairs act as nonvoting members of the senate, though all legislation not marked as urgent is generally analyzed by a commission before being put up for vote.

Internal Affairs, Academic Affairs, Business and Finance, and External Affairs have been parts of ASUCD since at least 1981 (detailed in the ASUCD Constitution, as amended January 1981).  Interestingly enough, IAC at that time was ASUCDs most programmatic commission.

 ASUCD Outreach Assembly 
The ASUCD Outreach Assemblys goal is to foster collaborative student activities, as well as inform the student body of ASUCD and student organization activities. The Outreach Assembly will also plan quarterly leadership summits. The Assembly consists of 12 unpaid positions, all of which outreach to every aspect of student life including clubs and fraternities/sororities.
Big projects they initiate are the Safe Boats event and the Night of Charity.

The current Speaker is Lauren Ashe.
Meeting Times: Wednesday at 7:10 in the DeCarli Room of the MU.

 Committees 
Committees are similar to commissions, but are smaller and fulfill specialized roles.  The real legislative distinction is that they make informal recommendations to Senate, as opposed to the official recommendation of the commissions.
General Purpose Committees  seeking student participation:
  The Elections Committee has been the most prominent recently, due to recent controversy. They serve primarily during the election seasons in Fall and Winter Quarters.

  Created in 2005, the StudentPolice Relations Committee, made a permanent committee in 2006, takes student concerns about the UCDPD and DPD to the citys PoliceStudent Relations SubCommittee.  They also lobby for Police Misconduct Stories reforms in the police department.
Internal Committees  these are committees of ASUCD officers that only meet for specific reasons:
  The Internet and Networking Committee serves to coordinate ASUCD Creative Media information technology staff and the government. This committee is chaired by the ASUCD Controller.
  The ASUCD Unit Relocation and Space Allocation Committee Unit Relocation and Space Allocation Committee (URSAC), created by ASUCD Controller Devin Whitney in 2006, is designed to move units around more smoothly than what happened in the AS PAPERs fiasco. This committee is chaired by the ASUCD Controller.
  The Special Committee on Bylaw Review, created by formerIAC Chair Sergio Cano in 2012, is responsible for performing a comprehensive review of the ASUCD Bylaws and making necessary changes to bring these uptodate and make them consistent with internal procedures. This Committee will automatically expire at the end of Spring 2012, or when a bill to implement the necessary changes in passed, whichever occurs first.
  The Committee on Committees, created by formerSenator Amy Martin in 2012, is responsible for advertising, reviewing applications, and appointing undergraduates to positions on ASUCDexternal committees, such as Administrative Advisory Committees and Academic Senate Committees.
  The Aggie Public Arts Committee, created as a special committee by formerSenator Alison Tanner in 2010, is responsible for enhancing the UC Davis campus and the larger Davis community by facilitating various public art projects from students and community members. In 2013, formerIAC Chair Sergio Cano made it became a permanent committee of the ASUCD Senate.

The ASUCD Senate may from time to time make Special Committees, which only last a year or less.  Some of the successful ones may also become permanent committees.  Current Special Committees:
  Special Committee on Renters Rights (Created in 2011)
  Special Committee on Student Health and Wellness known as the Student Health and Wellness Committee or SHAWC (Created in 2011)
  Special Committee on Outreach known as the Aggie Bound Outreach Committee (Created in 2011)

 Judicial 
The Court of the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis is legally one of three coequal branches of the ASUCD Associated Students, University of California, Davis. Charged with the ultimate authority to interpret the wording of the ASUCD Constitution ASUCD Constitution and that of legislation enacted pursuant to the Constitution, it has the power to review previously enacted legislation made by the Senate following a written request by any ASUCD member(s), and review complaints regarding the Elections Committee or any other office or body of ASUCD. This power is derived from Article VII of the ASUCD Constitution.



The Court consists of nine members, nominated by the ASUCD President and confirmed by the ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senate. The Chief Justice is chosen from among these by the same process.  Justices serve until they graduate, resign, or are indicted and impeached.  Justices may be permanently removed by a twothirds vote of the ASUCD Senate only after an indictment hearing conducted by the Internal Affairs Commission Internal Affairs Commission. Operating on an annual budget of $99 American Dollars, all members of the courts and their staffs are unpaid volunteers.

If any ASUCD member feels that an ASUCD officer is not conducting their job correctly, or ASUCD legislation is not consistent with ASUCD Constitution ASUCD Constitution and/or ASUCD Bylaws, they may file a complaint with SGAO Student Government Administrative Office through a complaint form. Following which SGAO will notify the Court and youll hear from the Court with further instructions when theyve decided whether or not to take the case.

Further, Preemptive Writs and Injunctions have been instituted as of the 20122013 term to aid the Jurisdiction of the Court. It allows ASUCD members to petition the court to issue writs to prevent imminent illegal actions contravening to the ASUCD Constitution and legislation enacted pursuant to it. If the Bench deems the evidence accompanied to be sufficient proof of imminent illegal actions, then the Court may issue a writ described within chapter ten of the ASUCD Judicial Codes, those writs shall be legally binding until such time as it is challenged, following which the issue will be escalated into a full hearing. Petitions forms for the issuance of writs are available again in the SGAO Student Government Administrative Office.

The current sitting Chief Justice is the Honorable Wooju Kim

The Court currently consists of (in order of seniority):

Served as Vice Chief Justice

 Bureaucracy  Student Services and Student Government Administrative Office 
  Upon Brett Burns move to the UC Davis law school, Anne Myler, the director of the Center for Student Involvement became interim Business Manager. Mark Champagne, who retired in June 2011 after 32 years of service to ASUCD, is currently acting as a consultant for the administration in this transitional period as President Sandstrom searches for a permanent replacement to Burns. The Business Manager is the top of the University (unionized) employee hierarchy within ASUCD.
  Student Services is best known as the source of paychecks for Coffee House and other ASUCD employees.  They do all the human resources and other office work for the commercial units.
  The most recent Student Government Advisor was Michael Tucker (formerly Eric Sanchez,  Vicki Swett). The position was cut during the 2008 budget hearings.
  SGAO Student Govt Administrative Office (SGAO, though invariably pronounced as SJAO) is the civil service of the ASUCD government  they perform government bureaucratic necessities
   Government Documents are available at the Student Government Administrative Office (SGAO), or (in a probably outdated and incomplete form) http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/government/govdocuments online

 ASUCD Units 
Blue rows are selfsufficient units. Red rows are subsidized units.  See the ASUCD Budget for more information.
1. The Bike Barn is considered a breakeven unit although they do not have their own reserves so they are occasionally subsidized by the ASUCD Senate senate (such as with the http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/05/09/FrontPage/Senate.Briefs1320479.shtml Bike Barns computer system).  In FY200607 they were the most profitable ASUCD unit.
2. Although nominally an advocacy unit, ASUCD City/County Affairs Office City/County puts on Housing day, and the profits from the event pay for all the expenses of the unit.
3. Unitrans is considered to have a breakeven budget because it is subsidized by Undergraduate Student Fees and TAPS.  It is as if all ASUCD members bought bus passes.

 ASUCD Services 
  There are Legal Services available. Every undergraduate gets 15 minutes per quarter of time with a lawyer.  Its just enough time to discover if you have a case or not.  Contact the Student Services Office and they will put you in contact with the lawyer.

 History 
ASUCD was originally established on December 10, 1910 as the Associated Students of the University Farm (A.S.U.F.) to provide more activities for students on campus.  Through 1909 and 1910, the only student organization had been an athletic association; A.S.U.F. took on the role of athletics and managed all other student activities, such as Picnic Day and fraternities.  On January 12, 1914, ASUF opened the Students CoOperative Store, later known as the Coop Store, which evolved into the UCD Bookstore.  Around 1925, the ASUF was renamed the Associated Student of the College of Agriculture (A.S.C.A.). The leadership body of A.S.C.A. (and A.S.U.F. before it) was the Executive Committee.   Students had to buy A.S.C.A. cards to become a member  membership included privileges such as free admission to athletic games, a discount at the Coop, and a subscription to The California Aggie.  The first mandatory fee was introduced in Spring semester of 1935; now all students were represented by the A.S.C.A. When Davis was designated as a general campus the association became known as ASUCD.  ASUCD has gone through several leadership bodies, including: the Executive Committee, the Legislative Assembly, Senate, Executive Council, and finally a Senate today in its current incarnation.

From 1960 to 2000 there was a committee for ASUCD Student Forums.
