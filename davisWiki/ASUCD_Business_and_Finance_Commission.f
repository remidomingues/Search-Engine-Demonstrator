The ASUCD Business and Finance Commission reviews many of the ASUCD Senate senate bills in ASUCD that involve the allocation and distribution of Capital and Senate Reserves. B&F has the ability to reject legislation, however those bills are typically revived and passed during regular Senate Meetings. All seven ASUCD Commissions have this same ability.

The B&F Commission meets weekly at 7pm on Tuesdays in the ASUCD Conference Room on the 3rd floor of the MU.

The Standing Rules fairly explicitly disallow someone from concurrantly being a Senator and being on the Commission, regardless of what the ASUCD webpage states.  The ASUCD webpage is nowhere referred to as having a binding authority.  Incidentally, the Senate page itself is about two months out of date at this point, not reflecting the effects of last election.  Also, as Users/BrentLaabs mentioned, one must resist the urge to restrict editorship of any page on wiki  it really is diametrically opposed to the theory of wiki. Users/KrisFricke, ASUCD Court Chief Justice, ASUCD

PS: as long as we have Users/MarkKlebanov a member of the actual commission editing this page, if they could as much as possible make the membership of this page resemble the actual membership of the commission rather than what is listed on the ASUCD webpage, that would be awesome
