The Committee on Student Music and Performing Arts was an ASUCD special committee that was supposed to bring Art and Music to the students, and emphasize student arts.  However, after the bill was passed to create the committee, no one was actually hired to be on the committee, and none of the Senators or authors of the bill actually worked on this at all.  The committee lapsed out of being at the end of its one year existence, without having met or having any members.
