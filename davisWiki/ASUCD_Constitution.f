 ARTICLE VIII ASUCD EXTERNAL RELATIONS 

Section 1. (1) Feebased initiatives cannot be passed for dedicated fees towards membership dues for any external organization. Feebased initiatives may still be passed so long as they do not fund these membership costs. An external organization is any organization which operates outside of the jurisdiction of ASUCD and the UC Davis campus.

Section 2. (1) Section 1 does not preclude ASUCD from entering into membership with an external organization. The ASUCD Senate may still dedicate funding from the ASUCD General Fund towards the membership dues of these organizations at their discretion, as outlined in Article IV Section 5.

 The Student Representation Act 

ABSTRACT: Under current rules, UC Davis is the only campus mandated to be represented by the University of California Student Association (UCSA), a lobbying organization on behalf of University of California students. The Ballot Measure serves not to end ASUCD’s affiliation with UCSA, but gives ASUCD a choice as to whom it is represented by.

A Ballot Measure to establish the “The Student Representation Act/UCSA ReAffiliation Act” by placing the following before a vote of the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis (ASUCD) Membership on the Fall 1999 election ballot.

BACKGROUND: UCSA was established three decades ago to represent and lobby for the interests of University of California students as agreed upon by its Board of Directors, which is made up of member campuses. Furthermore, ASUCD is unlike other UC student associations in that we are required by the 1995 “UCSA Affiliation Act” Ballot Measure to contribute to UCSA, limiting ASUCD’s choices and negotiation ability. Finally, ASUCD has not distributed membership fees as intended in the 1995 “UCSA Affiliation Act” because the method is not consistent with ASUCD practices.

Section 1. ASCUD hereby recognizes UCSA as an official systemwide representative body of University of California students, so long as UCSA recognizes ASUCD as a member in good standing with all rights and privileges guaranteed by the UCSA Charter and bylaws.

Section 2. ASUCD shall contribute to UCSA the minimum amount deemed necessary to remain a member of good standing, as determined by the UCSA Board of Directors. ASUCD may at any time recognize other entities as official representatives or discontinue membership in UCSA by enactment of legislation or through the annual operating budget. ASUCD shall only contribute UCSA membership fees via the annual operating budget.

Section 3. ASUCD hereby updates the 1995 “UCSA Affiliation Act” Ballot Measure with “The Student Representation Act/UCSA Reaffiliation Act” Ballot Measure.

Section 4. This Ballot Measure shall become null and void upon enactment of another Ballot Measure, which specifically enumerates nullifying this Ballot Measure. This Ballot Measure shall also become null and void upon enactment of legislation that specifically enumerates nullifying this Ballot Measure passed by a majority of the ASUCD Senate and signed by the ASUCD President in the event that one of the following conditions exist: 1) The minimum amount per student deemed by the UCSA Board of Directors necessary for an association to remain in good standing as full, voting members with all rights and privileges is set grossly unequally so that students of one association are taxed significantly more than students of another association; 2) The composition of the UCSA Board of Directors deviates from either equal or proportional representation of student associations; or 3) The decisionmaking authority of UCSA is changed in such a way as to make the Board of Directors a subordinate body or that grants voting membership on the UCSA Board of Directors to any person(s) not elected or appointed by a student association within the purview of the University of California to represent all of the students of that student association.

 Club Finance Council Entitlement Act 

ABSTRACT: A Constitutional Amendment to establish the Club Finance Council Entitlement Act by placing the following before a vote of the ASUCD Membership on the Winter Quarter 2001 election ballot.

BACKGROUND: This Constitutional Amendment will in no way increase students’ quarterly fees. Currently, ASUCD leadership has the discretion through the annual budget not to allocate funds to the Club Finance Council (CFC) for disbursement to over 250 clubs and organizations. This Constitutional Amendment obligates ASUCD leadership to appropriating at least 45 cents per student per quarter.

SECTION 1. The Associated Students, University of California, Davis shall grant to the Club Finance Council (CFC) a minimum of fortyfive (45) cents per undergraduate per academic quarter each fiscal year. ASUCD may annually set the CFC grant level beyond the minimum funding.

SECTION 2. The Associated Students, University of California, Davis shall only contribute to the CFC grant via the annual operating budget.

SECTION 3. Issuance of the CFC grant is contingent upon: 1) finalization of the annual operating budget; 2) all allocation and actions by the Club Finance Council is in accordance with CFC bylaws; 3) annual authorization by the ASUCD President.

SECTION 4. This Constitutional Amendment shall become null and void upon enactment of another constitutional amendment which specifically enumerates nullifying this Constitutional Amendment.
