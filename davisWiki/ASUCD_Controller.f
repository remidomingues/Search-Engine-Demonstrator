 Past Controllers 

 Assistant Business Managers 
ABMs were student the highest student financial position, appointed by the Executive Committee.  Later ABMs, however, worked under the Business Manager rather than the political officers, often in specialized roles such as Personnel or planning.



I think this position should be renamed http://dictionary.reference.com/search?qcomptroller comptroller.  Mainly because the latter looks cooler, but also the latter is more clearly a financial officer. Users/KrisFricke
   Thats crazy talk!

Note that CEO and COO are practical terms often used, in the corporate world, as additions to titles such as Chairman of the Board or Executive Vice President to denote actual levels of involvement in strategic decision making and daytoday operations, respectively.

I agree with Devin, this position should be called wiki:wikipedia:Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Sounds good.  Constitutional amendment, anyone?  Just remember, Paul for Chancellor 2007!


Controller is the CEO?  His decisions take precedence over the Presidents??  Im not sure hes even the COO visavis Mark Champagne. If it really says something about that in the Constitution well theyre really just throwing titles around then.  This comment not to reflect any opinion applicable to any actual or potential cases.
