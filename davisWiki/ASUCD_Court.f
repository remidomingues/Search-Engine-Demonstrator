The Court of the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis is legally one of three coequal branches of the ASUCD Associated Students, University of California, Davis. Charged with the ultimate authority to interpret the wording of the ASUCD Constitution ASUCD Constitution and that of legislation enacted pursuant to the Constitution, it has the power to review previously enacted legislation made by the Senate following a written request by any ASUCD member(s), and review complaints regarding the Elections Committee or any other office or body of ASUCD. This power is derived from Article VII of the ASUCD Constitution.

The Court currently operates on a budget of $99 AMERICAN DOLLARS.

The Court consists of nine members, nominated by the ASUCD President and confirmed by the ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senate. The Chief Justice is chosen from among these by the same process.  Justices serve until they graduate, resign, or are indicted and impeached.  Justices may be permanently removed by a twothirds vote of the ASUCD Senate only after an indictment hearing conducted by the Internal Affairs Commission Internal Affairs Commission.

If any ASUCD member feels that an ASUCD officer is not conducting their job correctly, or ASUCD legislation is not consistent with ASUCD Constitution ASUCD Constitution and/or ASUCD Bylaws, they may file a complaint with SGAO Student Government Administrative Office through a complaint form. Following which SGAO will notify the Court and youll hear from the Court with further instructions when theyve decided whether or not to take the case.

Further, Preemptive Writs and Injunctions have been instituted as of the 20122013 term to aid the Jurisdiction of the Court. It allows ASUCD members to petition the court to issue writs to prevent imminent illegal actions contravening to the ASUCD Constitution and legislation enacted pursuant to it. If the Bench deems the evidence accompanied to be sufficient proof of imminent illegal actions, then the Court may issue a writ described within chapter ten of the ASUCD Judicial Codes, those writs shall be legally binding until such time as it is challenged, following which the issue will be escalated into a full hearing. Petitions forms for the issuance of writs are available again in the SGAO Student Government Administrative Office.

Recent News
Justin Goss v. Jared CrisologoSmith (50 ASUCD 2012): The Respondent then Senator Jared CrisologoSmith was found guilt of violating the ASUCD Constitution by a 801 vote of the bench as he had motion and carried a vote to remove then Senate Pro Tempore Justin Goss on the 15th of November 2012. Additionally,it was found that any attempt to move and pass a motion to remove and/or replace a seating President Pro Tempore will be considered UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THEREFORE NULL AND VOID pursuant to the current ASUCD Constiution and Bylaws. The Majority Opinion was written by Justice Trinidad with Chief Justice Seche; Justices Ziyeh, Chau, Kim, Wang, Rashidi and Johnson concurring. Justice Bahia Chose to abstain.

Alyson Sagala v. Justin Goss (51 ASUCD 2013): The Bench found that ASUCD Bylaw 1002 Section C Subsection 2 falls under the right of the ASUCD Senate to regulate themselves in order to perform their enumerated duties. Any legislation that does not outright prohibit or severely restrict the ability of the ASUCD Senate to allocate resources as they see fit, in the view of this Court, does not violate the Constitutional rights of the Senate, but instead is a regulation by the Senate imposed on themselves. The legislative amendment in question was not proven to be a hindrance to the “smooth and efficient operation of the Association”; the bench agrees with the Respondent that the ASUCD Senate passed SB 26 with the intention to improve efficiency and continuity of funding for grants and general programs. The bench finds the Respondent not guilty, and thus the legislation that he authored and represented was found to be in accordance with the ASUCD Constitution and Bylaws by a 360 vote.  Therefore no action pertaining to the Petitioner or the Respondent will be ordered, and BL 1002(C)(2) will continue to be in effect ,as determined by the ASUCD Senate.The Majority Opinion was written by then Chief Justice Seche with Justices Ziyeh ,Bahia ,Chau ,Trinidad and Johnson concurring. Justices Kim, Wang and Rashidi dissenting; However, no dissenting opinion was written.

Felicia Ong v. Rylan Shaeffer et Tanzi Jackson et Desirae Costello (# ASUCD 2013): Remanded to petitioner due to incomplete paperwork

Miles Thomas v. Carly Sandstrom (52 ASUCD 2014): While the ASUCD institutions’ adherence to the Bylaws remains inconsistent, this is not sufficient grounds for present governmental officials to blatantly ignore Bylaws or provide grounds to “pickandchoose” Bylaws to follow. This Court finds ASUCD President Carly Sandstrom guilty of violating BL 1002(A)(1) of the ASUCD Bylaws.

Andrew Kinsey v. Sergio Gonzalez (# ASUCD 2014): Case dismissed at the request of Petitioner

Gloria Chen v. ASUCD Elections Committee was (# ASUCD 2014): filed on February 27 to invalidate passage of the Save The Aggie Measure 1.

The court also ordered the ASUCD Elections Committee to hold a new election in Spring quarter for Measure 1.


 History 
 The Prehistoric Court 
The prehistory of the Court is shrouded in myths and legends as record keeping in ASUCD seems to be shockingly bad.  In fact, though some recent Opinions have been submitted to SGAO multiple times as word documents, and they even printed them out and posted them, they still profess not to have them on record anymore.

The ASUCD Court was created in its recognizable form in 1995 as the Supreme Court through the Democracy at Davis constitutional amendment.  Just like in the federal government, the ASUCD Senate was empowered to create inferior courts, like an elections court, whose decisions could be appealed to the ASUCD Supreme Court.  However, this power was never used.  In 1996, over the objections of then ASUCD President Peter Nguyen and ASUCD Vice President Aaron Bloom, the ASUCD Senate reduced the stipends of members of the ASUCD Supreme Court, citing a lack of activity.  Nguyen and Bloom, as founders of the new system of government, pointed out that the Court was a passive branch of government which could only respond to cases filed by plaintiffs and that it should be accorded coequal status to the other 2 branches.  In the first seven years there were allegedly eight cases, five of which were in 1995 regarding ASUCD Elections elections issues.  (source: Background on Constitutional Amendment 1 of 2001)

In 2001 the ASUCD Supreme Court disqualified the Tiqula Bledsoe Bledsoe/Beaman executive ticket of the LEAD party for massive cheating worse than Ukraine in 2004 (they were very prescient back then). Tiqula Bledsoe Bledsoe, self proclaimed Black Caesar Black Caesar of ASUCD, then threatened to sue ASUCD, the Court, the UCD Administration Administration, and anyone else remotely involved back into the stone age. Under threat of this impending legal holocaust, the Court reversed its ruling and allowed the Reverend Tiqula Bledsoe to take office. Like the Romans razing Carthage to the ground and salting its former soil, Tiqula Bledsoe Bledsoe Maximus wanted to triumphantly squash his nemesis, the judiciary, and had its name changed legally to the ASUCD Court, and extralegally to Student Court, with Chairpersons and Members (see Identity Crisis, below). Also, and very significantly, all matters relating to ASUCD Elections elections were removed from the Courts jurisdiction. Having succeeded in this he then treated himself to the spoils of ASUCD, using government funds to pay for limos and parking tickets (not an exaggeration). Bledsoe would go on to be remembered for years to come for an administration marked by capricious misuse of ASUCD funds.

There followed a year during which the Court was so crushed that it did not even meet. Cases were filed (by Lamar Heystek, and Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke among others), but the plaintiffs in many cases never heard back from the Court once the complaint was filed.  When the Court resumed activity with the Move to D1 D1 Case, it was designated Case # 19; obviously this doesnt add up to the eight cases previously mentioned, unless ten were filed during the year of inactivity.  The truth to this matter is unclear.

In the winter of 2002, the Court had a major case regarding the move to D1.  It hinged upon a misprint in the Codes that led to confusion as to whether or not the referendum to place the Move to D1 question on the ballot.  The majority of the Court found that the referendum had indeed been placed incorrectly on the ballot and declared it therefore null and void.  Newly appointed Justice Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke was the sole dissenter, claiming that yes there was clearly a mistake in the process through which the referendum ended up on the ballot, but the Court did not have jurisdiction over ASUCD Elections elections and should have handed the case back to the Elections Committee once it had examined and interpreted the contested codes.  In response to this declaration, the ASUCD Executive Office stated we believe the Court is only advisory (obviously they had skipped over the part in the ASUCD Constitution Constitution which mentions binding opinions). The Court subsequently met with the UC Davis legal council, who informed them that Justice Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke was in fact correct and they were fairly far from the recognized path of legal norms.  Within a month the previous Chief Justice resigned, and Justice Users/KrisFricke Fricke was confirmed as the new Chief Justice just in time to swear in a new executive office.

Under the Users/KrisFricke Fricke Administration, the Court considered six cases the following year.

 The Identity Crisis 
In 2001 a ASUCD Constitution Constitutional Amendment was passed changing the name of the principal judicial organ of ASUCD from ASUCD Supreme Court to ASUCD Court. In the copies of the ASUCD Constitution Constitution and bylaws produced by SGAO, the change was rendered to Student Court, and in an overzealous rampage of derision, they proceeded to change every instance of Justice to Member, and Chief Justice to Chairperson, among other things.

Theres a poorly formatted http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2003/11/20/FrontPage/Student.Court.Looks.To.The.Future1315883.shtml?norewrite200604150360&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com Aggie Article about conflicts between Sara Henry President Henry and the Court.

After thorough discussion of the subject, the Court has determined that the references to Student Court etc, having never been legally rendered, are erroneous and that this constitutes a continuing erroneous behavior until it is changed in the copies that the SGAO is producing.  In the Winter of 2005 a ASUCD Constitution Constitutional Amendment was passed which intentionally referred to the Court as the ASUCD Court.  Thus that name has both been determined to be the accurate one through analysis of historical legislation, but has been reaffirmed by a ASUCD Constitution Constitutional amendment (which takes precedence over any previous conflicting references or references in subordinate bodies).  As of this writing, references to Student Court have been removed from all ASUCD bylaws, but the term remains in verbal use by more antiquated individuals.

 Questionable Importance 
During the 2004/2005 year no cases were filed.  Some senators took this to mean that ASUCD had become a utopian society and no longer needed the ASUCD Supreme Court.  During the Candidates Forum in Fall 2005 candidate Michael Aguilera Kongo Aguilera said he saw no role in ASUCD for the Court.  Shortly following that election four cases were filed.  The candidates will not be seated until the case regarding the election is resolved.  Without the role of the Court in the association, it is hard to imagine a resolution to this situation which would not involve the shadiness factor dubious overriding of bylaws, a cry of injustice and public opinion fiasco, or both.

Michael Aguilera Kongo Aguilera was subsequently appointed to the Court.

 Recent Years 
In recent years the Court has undergone reformation to closer match its counterpart in the US Federal Government the United States Supreme Court.

During the Seche Courts reforms, professionalism and procedural fairness became a priority. All cases were reformatted and made available on the main site. Previously lost files were rediscovered and reintegrated into the system. Trial Procedures were rewritten as to facilitate smoother proceedings. Further, under the Seche Court, the Bench saw a total of Five cases and seven advisory opinions ( Busiest year since 2005/6). None of which has has been non acquiesced by the other two branches of the Association, which had previously plagued Courts of the Past. A testament to the reforms. The Courts administrative bureaucracy was greatly expanded in order to better facilitate the reform process. It should be noted that the Court is also the least funded of the Three Branches of the Association. Supra prehistoric history all Justices and Clerks are unpaid volunteers.
