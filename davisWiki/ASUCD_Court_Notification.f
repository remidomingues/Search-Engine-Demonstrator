Judicial Code Five outlines the duties and rights of plaintiffs and defendants.  I shall here summarize it for you.  You may yourselves get a copy of the Judicial Codes from SGAO.

Both parties shall be represented by Council.  Council may be the parties themselves or another member of ASUCD.  Council shall present the partys case and act as spokesperson during the hearing.  Both parties may also be accompanied by an adviser who is not a member of ASUCD, but the adviser may not take direct part in the hearing. (Section 5023)

Either party may request a prehearing, at which the format of the hearing may be discussed, the Defendant may request a closed hearing, or either party may challenge the impartiality of one or more of the Court Members.

Both parties are responsible for filing the following documents:
(A) A list of witnesses to be called at the hearing and the general facts to which each witness will testify.
(B) A written brief in which counsel outlines the following:
 (a) the facts of the partys case;
 (b) the evidence to be presented at the hearing;
 (c) the arguments that counsel plans to present during oral form at the hearing. (Section 5011)
The Plaintiff must submit these documents to SGAO at least two academic days prior to a scheduled hearing or prehearing.  The Defendant must do so at least one day prior.  If a Party wishes to challenge the impartiality of a Court Member, they must submit a list of witnesses to be called on regarding that as well. (Section 5014)

At the Hearing both parties will have the opportunity to present argument in oral and documentary form and call witnesses to testify in accordance with Judicial Standing Rule Nine. (Section 5021F)

Each Defendant shall be entitled to appear and participate fully, in all aspects of the proceeding and in equal capacity with every other Defendant throughout the entire hearing.  A Defendant or may elect not to appear, and such a failure to appear shall not be construed as evidence of fault or culpability. (Section 5021K, SIC)

As regards Case # 25: Jonathon Leathers alleges that Vicki Swett et al violated 2003 Senate Bill # 48 by failing to put the documents online as called for in the Bill.


Section 5021L  The Burden of proof lies on the Plaintiff.  The Defendants are innocent until proven guilty in Court.


Section 5021 requires that I inform the parties of all these things.
Let me reiterate that Plaintiff documents are due Thursday (04/12/04), and Defendant documents on Friday (04/13/04) for Case # 24, and 04/19/04 and 04/20/04 for Case $ 25, respectively.  If you have any further questions or official requests feel free to submit them to me.

                                       (signed)
                                       Kris Fricke
                                       Chairman, Student Court
                                       (530)5743599


The Chairman would like to remind everyone involved not to take personal insult from the Courts operations.  The existence of a complaint does not reflect any personal motives of the Court Members, and though we shall do our utmost to see Justice through to its completion it is by no means out of a desire to inconvenience any of the Parties.
