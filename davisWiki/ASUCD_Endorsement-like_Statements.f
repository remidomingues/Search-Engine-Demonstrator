Fall 2005 Election

For the ASUCD Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Senate Candidates Fall 2005 Election on November 16 and 17 these groups and/or individuals have made either official or unofficial endorsements. Endorsements on this page are unofficial, according to ASUCD rules, except where specifically noted as being official.

ASUCD Senate and Staff

  ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senate President ProTempore Thomas Lloyd endorses:

   1) Tiny Sanders  Tiny will bring an energy to ASUCD that has yet to be fully utilized by current or recentpast senators.  His extensive involvement outside of ASUCD, with a particular emphasis among freshmen from summer advising, will be an important step in breaking ASUCD barriers to the rest of the student body.

   2) Avni Patel  Avni brings the most experience of any candidate when it comes to getting tangible things accomplished.  She is clearly the most organized and adept for the structure of ASUCD meetings and legislation.

   3) Jenny Yu  Jennys emphasis on voter registration gives her experience in an area that would replace the experience lost with Nadeah, Thomas, and Janines Fall departure.

   Yes on both of the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Ballot Measures Constitutional Amendments (ones mine and the others one I worked on).


  ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senator Rob Roy endorses:

   1) I officially and retroactively rescind my endorsement of Joseph Harney, mainly because he did not raise his hand when I asked everyone in a room to raise their hands if they love democracy. Also because I have the power to do so and if there is one thing that matters to Joe, it is power.

      You are absolutely correct Rob Roy, I did not raise my hand when you called for everyone who loves democracy to raise his or her hand.  What you called for was Mob Democracy, where the tyranny of the majority overrides every consideration, including the rule of law.  Your brand of democracy is the same kind that allowed slavery to exist as a perfectly legal institution in this country for over one hundred years. I, like the founding fathers of our nation, firmly believe in the principles of Representative Republicanism and the Rule of law.  Where the rights of everyone, not just the popular, are protected.  A society in which no one is above the law that binds all to follow them.  You have proven yourself to be nothing more than a Creature of the Mob, willing to sacrifice the principles our founding fathers shed their blood to wrench from the Tyrannical grasp of King George of England.  I proudly accept your repudiation of support, for I do not wish to be associated with someone who would allow injustices to be done in the name of political expediency.Joe Harney

      Mob democracy eh? Looks to me like all the elected representatives of the student body agreed on something. Albeit it something you did not agree with with, but nonetheless a very diverse group of people, constituting various national political parties as well as three ASUCD Slate slates, and two independents agreed that this was the best solution. Call me a tyrant, you have the first amendment right to do so, but the law is neither fair nor moral  it is simply a written set of rules for a political game. In this case, we had the ability to write and/or rewrite the law and make it more moral and fair because it does not exclude people for having done things that will not affect their job performance. I would prefer you to complain more about my use of John 8:7 to explain the morality of the new law that we wrote in effort to make things more fair in elections.  Users/RobRoy

   2) Avni Patel  Avni has been active in ASUCD for years, in several different roles, and is well versed on how it operates. She probably has the most amount of ASUCD experience of any other candidate.

   3) Kareem Salem  Kareem has a lot of great ideas and has experience working within an ASUCD unit, being a Unitrans bus driver. (Plus he is a funny guy and would be entertaining to share the Senate Table with).

   4) Jenny Yu  Jenny works within ASUCD in two different departments and is certainly not a fish out of water on how the senate operates.

   5) Katie Webber  Katie was the president of her high school and served as the Student Liaison to her City Council. I know she is a freshman but she has some good qualifications.

   6) Christine Rogers  I think Christine has really thought about hard hitting original issues and I think she has the passion to implement them. Plus she has been active on campus for years.

   Also, Yes on both of the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Ballot Measures Constitutional Amendments.
