The ASUCD Entertainment Council books concerts and film events on the UC Davis Campus. Most events are booked directly by the Entertainment Council, but the Council also assists campus clubs and offcampus promoters in booking events on campus.

For more information on our upcoming events as well as information on becoming a volunteer, visit the EC website, or like the EC Facebook page.

 When did the Entertainment Council die? Back in the day, they used to regularly bring loads of alternative music to campus and even big names like The Dead. It used to be far more active and not nearly as mainstream as it seems to be now. Could somebody please light a fire? Â—AlphaDog

More free shows in the CoHo!  Expensive acts in Freeborn Hall are cool but most cant afford them.  wiki:WikiPedia:Nine_Inch_Nails NIN even asked the Entertainment Council not to advertise in The Aggie because they have a vested interest in selling nonstudent (read: more expensive) tickets.
  Word on the street is that there are awesome CoHo shows planned for this spring!
    Where can one find info about upcoming shows? Oncampus ads are hitormiss.The Entertainment Council website hasnt had listings for months now.
      As far as I know all the latest shows have been posted to the Events Board here, but I dont think the EC maintains a public list (I think that information was pruned from a couple of AIM screen names)?  Considering I Gay PD live with one of the EC people youd think theyd all get posted here, but Amies lazzzy.. Users/PhilipNeustrom
