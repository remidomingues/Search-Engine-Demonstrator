The Environmental Policy and Planning Commission (EPPC) is an ASUCD Commission composed of nine governing members and two alternates. Commission members are responsible for researching environmental issues affecting the UCD campus and community to apply thorough examination of incoming legislation. The ASUCD Environmental Policy and Planning Commission (EPPC) is one of the 7 legislative commissions under the ASUCD Senate. Like ECAC and GASC, EPPC is a programmatic commission, that works to create a more environmentally sustainable campus.  EPPC also advises the ASUCD Senate on any environmental legislation and policy ideas.

EPPC is committed to providing environmental representation of legislation to ASUCD, creating new environmental legislation, and enforcing past environmental legislation. It is the goal of EPPC to provide  environmental education and outreach in order to better inform students  and the campus community about the environmentally relevant concerns. EPPC works with students, administration, ASUCD, environmental groups, the City of Davis, and other relevant bodies in order to better recognize and  address the environmental concerns of the campus and the community. EPPC  collaborates with these groups to create a more Sustainability sustainable campus.

In April of 2007, 2008 and 2009, EPPC hosted EPPC Earth Week, which is a weeklong series of programs and events meant to draw out the glory of Earth Day. Highlights during the past three years were the Trashion Show (a collaboration with the http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200047138 Student Fashion Association), a rockclimbing wall on the quad, courtesy of the Rocknasium, a Meat vs. Beet debate that contemplated the pros and cons of the vegetarian and nonvegetarian lifestyles. Trashion Show 2008 was on the cover of the California Aggie and drew a huge crowd on the MU Patio. EPPC Earth Week shirts are also really cool. However, EPPC 2010 may feature the EPPC logo on different products, such as BPAfree water bottles, LED rechargable flashlights and other such items.

EPPCs theme for Earth Week 2009 was Get Down to Earth. The logo at the top left of this page, as well as the Get Down to Earth logo below were both designed by Angel Villadarez, who also designed the 2007, 2008 and 2009 logos. He is awesome, and so is EPPC.

+ Environmental Lecture  http://lda.ucdavis.edu/people/bios/wheeler.html Professor Stephen Wheeler of Landscape Architecture read an enlightening anecdote about environmental utopia from a book he edited.

+ 3rd Annual Trashion Show  EPPC and the Student Fashion Association joined forces again to reinforce the importance of sustainable practices. The winning outfits included and dress and hat made entirely of wallpaper, a dress made entirely of candy wrappers, and a vest made from burlap with a matching purse. This outfit also included a skirt made entirely of pages from a phonebook.

+ Environmental Club Fair  Many environmental clubs agreed that there was a major disconnect between each other. So, EPPC hosted a club fair to collectively publicize each clubs distinct cause and/or purpose. Among those who participated were the Davis Vegetarian Society, Students for Sustainable Agriculture, Project Compost, R4 Recycling R4 and the California Student Sustainability Coalition.

After Earth Week, EPPC, Gender and Sexuality Commission GASC and http://cce.ucdavis.edu/ CCE joined together to inform students about the impacts of sex on the environment in an event titled Green Sex.

In November, EPPC worked with yourenew.com, an electronic waste recycling company, to hold an Ewaste Recycling Event where students brought in old electronics to get recycled. Valuable items were compensated for and all the electronics were taken to a recycling center. Items people brought in included cell phones, mp3 players, cameras, laptops, cds, and many other numerous electronics.

On February 25, 2009 EPPC hosted Who Killed the Electric Car? in CHEM 194. In lieu of the movie,  the http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/index.php UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies was present at the MU Patio from about 121 pm where there was a hybrid plugin car on display to showcase research going in the field of alternative energy and transportation.

2008s logo and theme:

On October 30, 2008, EPPC and the Student Fashion Association hosted the Green Halloween Fashion Show. It featured sustainable fashion designs, KDVS DJ Marly Young and really hot models. The winning design was a 1950s girl ensemble with a newspaper poodle skirt, plastic bag scarf and plastic bakery box purse.


On November 24, 2008, EPPC hosted the ultrapopular local band Sex, Funk and Danger at the Delta of Venus and gave away 75 free reusable bags! The band members produced some sweet beats, and even gave the crowd some shockingly sad statistics about the detrimental impact of plastic bags on the environment. The point of this event was make environmental awareness fun. All 75 bags were gone by the end of the night! You can party and save the earth at the same time.

 Reduce Your Impact 
  This is an awesome list of ways you can reduce your ecological footprint: /Reduce Your Ecological Footprint Read more here.


20050302 11:24:33 nbsp Just enabled comments here so people can share their environmental concerns with the Commission (or at least anyone from it who happens to check here).  On that note, Ive always felt that the amount of paper wasted in ASUCD government business alone could be significantly reduced by pushing for Commissions to discuss resolutions via powerpoint instead of each having a copy of everything  that way changes could be easily made on one central copy everyone is looking at.  It would be easy in commissions, where the screens are already in place.  Id like to push for it in Senate as well but I dont know how one would deal with the fact that the screen in the senate room is in an inconvenient corner. Users/KrisFricke

20050309 17:52:18 nbsp here is something else that EPPC can push for....stop making those stupid waste of paper student telephone directories! Make it on CDRom or something of that nature. I get soooooooo angry every time i see boxes of directories sitting in the CoHo! That right there is a massive waste of paper Users/GeorgejAndrews

  Not to mention that they are usually incredibly outdated and have information on people who requested that their personal information not be included.  Users/JonathonLeathers Jonathon Leathers

   Good call George. But I read in the Aggie that the people who make the directories know that people sont use them and the info is out of date but they make them because the ads make money. The directory is pretty dumb, especially with practically everyone being on Facebook (although I prefer http://www.daviscoeds.com davisCoeds). You may be right about a CDRom. It would be cheaper and it could still have ads. Users/RobRoy
   Yeah, because I totally want a stalker CDRom with a bunch of ads in it.  I think those things are pretty useless, if someone wants to give their number or whatever to someone, they will. No one uses them, so they could save money by not printing them in the first place.  Users/AllisonEriksen

CEQA compliance and general plan issues. During his 13 years at the
