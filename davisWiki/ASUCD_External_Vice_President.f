Unlike the majority of other ASUCs and GSAs, ASUCD does not have and has never had an External Vice President, an elected person responsible for dealing with external affairs.  The debate on creating this position has existed for many years, and continues to be debated within ASUCD; however, the general consensus is that an External Vice President (EVP) is not necessary.  This debate came to head in 2004, when Senator Donald CohenCutler proposed a constitutional amendment creating an EVP, which did not pass the Senate.  In the meantime, debate has died away with the departure of Brian McInnis.

 Advantages 

  Direct Representation  The electorate may not know what kind of external affairs policy the ASUCD may be setting at election time.
  Accountability   Elections are frequently run on internal issues, such as Tipsy Taxi Tapsy Ticksy, and not on external issues.
  Power structure  one person is accountable for all of external affairs, consolidating power.

 Disadvantages 

  Representation  As the current structure stands, the Unit Directors of Lobby Corps, ASUCD University Affairs, and ASUCD City/County Affairs Office are hired by a committee consisting of the President, Vice President, the outgoing Unit Director, Business Manager, and two Senators, and are then confirmed by the Senate as a whole.  Since Senators are elected by Choice Voting, the entire student body is represented in this informed microcosm, and hired person must represent more than just his or her personal goals.
  Diversity of opinion  Hired external affairs people are responsible to the entire student government  elected people are responsible only to themselves.
  Accountability  An elected person is accountable only to a recall election, but an appointed official is accountable to the entire Senate and President, and can be removed or their funding cut.
  Power structure  The EVP would create a new hierarchical structure, while the current ASUCD power structure is more distributed.  More and different goals can be accomplished under the current system.  Brian McInnis One person cant impede everyones progress.
  Communication  An EVP may not be informed on what is going on in the rest of the government, and will be less likely to understand the problems in ASUCD.  Therefore, an EVP may not represent students and the student government as well at organizations such as UCSA, and instead work on personal goals.
