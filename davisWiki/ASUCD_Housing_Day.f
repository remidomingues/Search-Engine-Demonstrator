ASUCD Housing Day is an annual event organized by the ASUCD City/County Affairs Office ASUCD Office of City and County Affairs. It is held in Freeborn Hall, usually in midFebruary. ASUCD rents out spaces to various apartment complexes and property management companies. Housing Day provides transfer students, freshmen, and even 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students a place to find and select from a variety of housing options all in one convenient location.The event is a money maker for the the ASUCD.

Housing Day 2011 will be held on February 10th from 10:00am3:00pm at Freeborn Hall. The event is free and open to all members of the public. Over 50 complexes in Davis and the surrounding area will be attending.


During the 2005 ASUCD Budget Hearings, the ASUCD Senate voted to raise the fee charged for each booth from $35 to $100, to increase revenue. No decrease in demand for the event was noticed. Perhaps this is due to the high vacancy rate in Davis.

In 2011, the ASUCD City/County Affairs Office voted for a no sponsorship event. Therefore, the fee for each booth was raised to $225 with an option for Priority Tables (tables with prime location and guaranteed student foot traffic) for $500 a table.

In 2012, a stamp card will be implemented during the Housing Day event. Apartment complexes opt for a spot on the stamp card and students visit each place on the stamp card to turn in the completed card with a chance to win the main prize. The main prize for 2012 is a MACBOOK AIR provided by Tandem Properties!

US Housing and Tandem Properties are two major contributors to the event. US Housing is an advertising company that is paid by apartment owners, while Tandem one of the largest apartment complex owners in Davis.
