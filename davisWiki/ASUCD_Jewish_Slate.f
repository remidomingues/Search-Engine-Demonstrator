The http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2207713051 Jewish Slate is a slate that attempted to run for office in the Fall 2006 ASUCD Election, however, they did not get the required number of signatures to get a candidate onto the ballot. They were inactive during the Winter 2007 election, and do not appear to have a presence at Davis currently.  This slate was probably intended to be a play on the Christian Slate.

Morty Zuckerberg has been called the Jewish Slates mascot. An allegedly fictitious character, Morty looks like he could definitely be a ladies man.

Some of our platform ideas include:

  University wide observance of Jewish holidays, including: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Purim, Sukkot, Chanukah, Passover, Tu BShevat, Simchat Torah, Shavuot, Yom Hashoah, Shabbat, and any others I may have forgotten.
  Offering more sale items at the bookstore.
  Banning the display of any Mel Gibson film on campus or in the city of Davis whether it is for educational or entertainment purposes.
  Standing against any and all campus antisemitism at UC Davis.
  Establishing an intercollegiate Gaga Team.
  Eliminating Tipsy Taxi on Friday evenings in observance of the Sabbath. This would also include any Unitrans service before sundown on Saturday.
  Offering more late night Chinese take out options on campus.
  Securing the Davis/Woodland border.
  Increasing funding for both the University Medical School and Law School.
  Making Picnic Day more grandparent friendly.
  Stopping the sale of pork in the Universitys Meat Lab.
