The ASUCD Legislative Assembly was an early precursor to the ASUCD Senate in the 1960s and 1970s.  This was the body in charge of ASUCD when it moved from a faculty, student, and staff organization to an allstudent constituent organization in 1967.

In the earlier years, members were elected by a representative model, where various housing areas elected their own representatives. The fraternities had a representative all to themselves.  Later on, they had elected officers based off of their sphere of influence in the government.  For example, Tom Aguilar (current Graduate Student Association Vice Chair) served as the Internal Affairs Representative.

This body was preceeded by the ASUCD Executive Committee (earlier: ASCA, even earlier: ASUF), and was succeeded by the ASUCD Executive Council.
