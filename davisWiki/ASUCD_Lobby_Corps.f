History

  Past Directors
   Karandev Singh (2012  2013)
   Bihter Ozedrine (2010  2011)
   Talia MacMath (20082009)
   Derick Lennox (20062008)
   Michael Caporusso (20052006)
   Brian McInnis (20042005)
   Thomas Lloyd (20032004)
   Liz Burrell (20022003)

 From 20042006 Lobby Corps was a subunit of the ASUCD Office of External Affairs(OEA). Caporusso was the director of the subunit. McInnis was director of OEA and assumed the role of Lobby Corps director during his time. After the spring 2006 OEA, under Darnell Holloways ASUCD President presidency, was broken back up into its three components of ASUCD City/County Affairs Office, ASUCD State and National Affairs Office, and Lobby Corps. When ASUCD pulled out of UCSA in November 2006, Lobby Corps and ASUCD State and National Affairs Office became the sole state and national representative for UCD students. Even though the ASUCD State and National Affairs Office used to be in charge of ASUCD dealings with UCSA, after ASUCD pulled out, this office for some reason did not know what to do with itself, which resulted in its disbandment. At that time, Lobby Corp became ASUCDs sole state and national representative for UCD students. They also receive a significant portion (roughly $15,000) of the former UCSA funds which are now used to hire a private public affairs firm to provide professional training and research.
