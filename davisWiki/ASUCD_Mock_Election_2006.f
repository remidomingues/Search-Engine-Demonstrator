The ASUCD Mock Election 2006 is officially the most awesometastic event in ASUCD Elections history.  Twelve candidates vie for for six fake ASUCD Senate Senate seats in the biggest intraoffice conflict in recent ASUCD history.  The rationale behind the mock election is to test the ASUCD voting website (more info at http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/10/30/CampusNews/Asucd.To.Hold.fake.Election.This.Week2409304.shtml The Aggie).

For the most part, candidates are people who cant run for office for one reason or another:  being a graduate student, a Chief Justice of the ASUCD Supreme Court, a member of the Elections Committee, a 30year employee of ASUCD, or a current or future ASUCD Controller Controller.  Also, the entire staff of XSGAOX __The Really Cool People Commission__ was running.

The election is over, and you can view the detailed results at http://elections.ucdavis.edu

 Candidates 

  XUsers/BrentLaabs Brent Secret Documents LaabsX
   Brent is the recalled and disgraced Chair of the Board for UCSA.  Brents platform is on his BrentLaabs/Issues personal page, as well as on http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2217412823 facebook.  He also has so much free time on his hands that he made fliers and put them on bulletin boards on campus.
  Users/KrisFricke Kris Jedi Mind Tricks Fricke
   Kris Fricke is the current Chief Justice of the ASUCD Court ASUCD Supreme Court. Fricke details his candidacy on http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2214086864 facebook and on EMOSNAIL.  You trust the Jedi, right?  No?  Welcome to the club. The previous sentence was written by Paul Harms, who clearly intends to purge the Jedi Temple and establish the ASUCD Empire.
  Users/PaulHarms Paul the Pope Harms
   Paul Harms is the Media Coordinator for SGAO, and is the self declared Pope of ASUCD.  He is also rumoured to have a red lightsaber.  Paul has a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2214606635 facebook group, but Brent wants you to rank him last place anyway (because Brent knows that if Paul wins the election, the ASUCD gulag gains a graduate student).
  Users/JillWeinstein Jill I Love Bylaws Weinstein
   Jill Weinstein has been a member of the Internal Affairs Commission for over a year.  However, Jill apparently doesnt understand how Choice Voting works, because shes asking people to vote for her in the http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2216943396 #3 slot.  (Surprisingly, she was the third person elected  maybe she knows something we dont.)
  XKai SavareeRuess Kai KDizzle SavareeRuessX
   Kai SavareeRuess is the current ASUCD Controller
  XMark ChampagneX
   Mark Champagne has been the Business Manager for ASUCD for a longer than youve been alive.  Mark doesnt need a platform, because he already runs ASUCD and will continue to do so in spite of what you silly mortals think.
  XMichael Tucker Michael Pearl Jam on the Quad TuckerX
   Michael Tucker is the current ASUCD Student Government Advisor, who is famous for attempting to declare things such as court cases by Advisorial Decree.  He moonlights at Unitrans as office staff.
  XUsers/KyleFlick Kyle Im kind of a big deal FlickX
   Kyle Flick is the Publicity Coordinator on the Elections Committee, and could have been the Director of ASUCD City/County Affairs Office City/County Affairs.  Kyle seems to be running primarily on how big of a deal he is.  See http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2217303443 the facebook.
  XUsers/EmilyTung Emily Bread and Circuses TungX
   Emily Tung is the Director of the Entertainment Council, and is awesome in many ways.
  Rachel Not Renee Bingham
   Rachel Bingham is the Office Coordinator of SGAO, and rules over it with an iron fist.  Not really.  Actually, shes pretty nice.
  Renee Not Rachel Ashbaugh
   Renee is an employee of SGAO who is not Rachel.
  Chantha the Amazing Asian Neung
   Chantha Neung is an employee of SGAO who has a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2215547090 huge facebook group, and so she will probably win this popularity contest, mostly because her facebook groups title neglects to state that shes not actually running for the real ASUCD Senate.

Disclaimer: Some of these candidates may be obsessed with Star Wars and just might try to boost there ego by pretending to be a fictional character.
