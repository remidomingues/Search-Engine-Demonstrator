The goal of the ASUCD Outreach Assembly is to foster collaborative student activities and inform the student body of ASUCD and student organizations student organization activities. The ultimate goal of the ASUCD Outreach Assembly is to make ASUCD an accessible resources for students to get involved, get services, and get funding. The Outreach Assembly will put on two (2) Funding and Resource Forums, two (2) ASUCD Fairs within the dorms, and their annual Week of Competition.  Outreach Assembly plans to continue providing student organizations with resources through events and other distribution outlets.

Outreach Assembly used to give out grants to student organizations that collaborate with other student organizations.  However, the Rebecca Sterling executive office did not find that a priority.

 History 

In Fall 2007 the Assembly replaced the ASUCD Campus Outreach and Organizing Office as the outreach arm of ASUCD. The Assembly was created when the ASUCD Outreach Assembly Winter 2007 Measure passed in the Winter 2007 ASUCD election, accompanied by a Senate Bill specifying the Assemblys structure. The legislation was authored by Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs, James Schwab, Kevin Powers, Users/JillWeinstein Jill Weinstein, Mike Rivera, and Paul Harms. The measure is one of very few bills that was referred to every ASUCD Commission and passed unanimously, although different fiscal and structural alternatives were discussed. The idea for the assembly was created over the summer 2006 by the authors who wanted to created a more effective outreach body for ASUCD.

The 2009  2010 school year was the last where assembly members were paid to attend club meetings.

In the 2010  2011 school year, in addition to planning OAs Week of Competition they raised funds to provide a Safe Boat for House Boats 2011.

The 2011  2012 school year was the last where the assembly awarded grants to encourage student groups to work together to create bigger initiatives.

It bears a good deal of similarities to Dave Rand President Rands 1997 Core Council, only the appointment process works in reverse.
