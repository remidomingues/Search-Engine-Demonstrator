Before its discontinuance in 2009 Pathfinder was an outreach unit of ASUCD. Pathfinders mission was to promote diversity on the university campus by helping student from disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions and historically under represented communities in their schools K12 years. Through tutoring and mentoring Pathfinder helps these students ensure their path to a brighter future: college.

To help prepare all students for the rigorous education of the UC system, Pathfinder tutored students  in the academic subjects of math, science, and English. Assisting local elementary, middle, and high schools in improving the academic and social welfare of all students will help increase and maintain diversity of the UC Davis (and other universities) undergraduate population. Although Pathfinder currently serves only Davis Senior High School and Dixon High School, Pathfinder is still developing and plans to expand to other local schools.

Pathfinder also conducted campus tours of University of California, Davis for any school (elementary, middle, and high) in the state that requested Pathfinder to have one. While the tour will focus on UC Davis, Pathfinder hopes that the tour will encourage students to apply for college even if its not UC Davis and will promote awareness and understanding of higher education options. At the end of each tour a student panel allows high school students to talk to UC Davis students about any and every aspect of college life just, giving these students an idea of what to expect in college.
