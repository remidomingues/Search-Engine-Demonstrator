 Can someone doublecheck this for me in the Aggie archives in Shields?  My notes have Roberts as President in 1914, and then crossed off, and I have no idea what I meant by that at the time.  Im very nontrusting of nonprimary source documents, being misled by them so many times about ASUCD, that Id like a more definitive answer.  Im not in Davis or Id do this myself. Users/BrentLaabs

 Historical Notes

  Im going to do a research project for ASUCD and Student Affairs, researching the names of all of the ASUCD Executive Officers. Ill see what I can put together for you.   Users/BrentLaabs
   There have been five female ASUCD Presidents throughout history, as of 2007.   Users/BrentLaabs Addendum: Many other schools got their first female student association presidents right around 1943: the same time Davis was closed for business.  On the other hand, ASUCDs first black president was exceptionally early, in 1949.  Femalefemale executive tickets tend to lose more often, though this can also be attributed to bad timing as much as to social double standards.
