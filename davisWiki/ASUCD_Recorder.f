The ASUCD Recorder is a paid position responsible for recording the open minutes of ASUCD Senate meetings, attendance, changes and edits to legislation, vote tallys, collecting reports from Senators and photo copying papers to various paper for the Student Government Administrative Office(SGAO). The ASUCD Recorder is also present during ASUCD Budget Budget meetings.  They are usually stationed next to the ASUCD Vice President and are the only ones that have a laptop on the table, and the only one at the Senate table who is not a part of Senate discussion. This is because they are not a public officials, but simply a paid person who keeps a meeting running.

Ideally an ASUCD Recorder should be able to type 50+ words a minute, know peoples names, have a good sense of hearing, and have some sense of ASUCD terms and phrases.  A recorder also needs a laptop and although one should not depend on it, a tape recorder.  It is not expected that the Recorder be able to transcribe every single word spoken during the meetings but should be able to cover general ideas and points of a speaker.  Open government is dependent in many ways to the ASUCD Recorder.

Contact information for the ASUCD Recorder as well as applications to apply to be one, a may be found in the SGAO on the Third floor of the MU.  Recorders do not have office hours in SGAO. Recorders are paid based on their hours in the ASUCD Senate meeting as well as the hours transcribing their notes to SGAO.
