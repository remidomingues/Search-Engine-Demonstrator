ASUCD Response to SB 1412

Author: James Schwab Schwab, Reagan, Bemis Introduced by: Avni Patel Patel

An ASUCD resolution to oppose California State http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/SB_1412 Senate Bill Number 1412.

Background: California Senator Bill Morrow has introduced Senate Bill Number 1412 (SB 1412), formerly Senate Bill Number 5 (SB 5), known as the Public postsecondary education standard: Student Bill of Rights, which requests the University of California Regents to develop and implement a set of guidelines and principles related to academic freedom.

WHEREAS, SB 1412 specifies that Curricula and reading lists in the humanities and social sciences shall respect the uncertainty and unsettled character of all human knowledge in these areas, and provide students with dissenting sources and viewpoints; and,

WHEREAS, SB 1412 specifies that teachers should not take unfair advantage of students immaturity by indoctrinating him or her with the teachers own opinions; and,

WHEREAS, SB 1412 would use the banner of academic freedom and students rights to undermine the safety and integrity of our learning environment; and,

WHEREAS, SB 1412 wrongfully distrusts the University of Californias commitment to academic freedom and to its own strict policies (such as Regents Policy # 6065) against indoctrination and ideological intimidation; and,

WHEREAS, SB 1412 disrespects the maturity of students across all political, ideological, and religious spectra and our abilities as individuals; and,

WHEREAS, any Student Bill of Rights must originate from the actual students to be legitimate; therefore be it

RESOLVED, that the Associated Students of the University of California at Davis (ASUCD) opposes Senate Bill 1412 and any attempts to undermine the integrity of our learning environment; and be it further

RESOLVED that the ASUCD equally opposes any form of indoctrination and ideological intimidation, and encourages any students who truly suspect such activities to report them; and be it finally

RESOLVED, that the ASUCD will lobby state legislators to oppose Senate Bill Number 1412.

Update
The ASUCD Resolution passed 831 and was inevitably signed by the President.


Note: According to some of my sources, there was a meeting about this Students Bill of Rights on 17th April 2006. Was this the result of that meeting, or was the meeting just hearsay?Users/MaxMikalonis

You may be talking about the Senate committee hearing which was scheduled for April 19th. Or perhaps you mean the time when the ASUCD committees heard the bill Users/SteveOstrowski Steven Ostrowski

I think it was the committee, because someone was supposed to be on the committee and was like, Wait, thats my room, my time, and I hope isnt my committee. And now I see the difference between talking in an official position and as an individual.Users/MaxMikalonis Max Mikalonis
