The ASUCD Senate consists of 22 elected and nonelected students who collectively adopt and manage the associations 12 million dollar budget, considers bills and resolutions and individually and jointly undertake various projects designed to enhance the quality of life for students on campus . Senate meetings are open to the public, and held every Thursday during the school year, in Meeting Room D (2nd floor of Student Community Center) starting at 6:10pm. /Minutes Minutes of each meeting are typically available in SGAO (3rd floor Memorial Union).

As for elections, all undergraduate students at UC Davis UCD can vote for anyone they want.  In addition to Independent independent candidates, there are Slate slates here at UC Davis  akin to political parties.  Slates with current officials are:


See Senate History for historical information, or see Slates for newly formed, inactive, or past slates that do not currently have elected officials.



 Composition 
Presiding Officer: ASUCD Vice President (1, elected, breaks affirmative/negative ties) Maxwell Kappes
 Senators (12, elected, voting)

 President Pro Tempore of the Senate

 Commission Chairs (7, appointed, nonvoting)

The Senate is responsible for voting on and creating bills and orders that say how ASUCD should operate.  Being a Senator is a very important job because of the sheer size of ASUCD.  Also, ASUCD Senators and other executives are often invited, through the UC Davis University, to various important social and political functions.  An example of this is the summer 2005 function http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/story/13578397p14418730c.html Perspectives on Poverty, which featured Colin Powell, John Edwards, and John Ashcroft.

A past senate seems to have had a bit of an attendance problem.  This led 4 past senators to write a http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/06/06/Opinion/Letters.To.The.Editor2025419page2.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com letter to the editor in the Aggie.

Senators also hire Senate Interns, who serve as volunteer assistants.  Despite the fact that these are always advertised in elections as qualifications, they are typically wiki:wikipedia:sinecure offices.

 Power Structure  

With 5 NOW, 4 SMART, and 3 Independent senators, neither of the slates possess a majority.  Further, for the SMART bloc to garner enough votes to pass financial legislation (2/3: 8 senators) they must see bipartisan support from NOW.  In the event of a tie, Vice President Kappes, an Independent serving under a SMART President, holds the tiebreaking vote.

 Scandals/Corruption 

The ASUCD Senate has generated some interesting scandals recently.  These include:
   Chad Roberts graduating and finishing his term without actually doing anything. http://theaggie.org/article/1990

   It is documented that members of the ASUCD Senate have been routinely invited to join the ranks of the secretive organization known as Sword and Sandals.
   It is rumored that Senators smoked marijuana during the 2004 Budget Hearings. http://www.daviswiki.org/Budget_Hearing_Scandal?actionrecall&date1108075800 Original Daviswiki Source wiki:drama:Daviswiki Deepthroat / Fingercuffs Incident Amusing ED Article

   Fall 2012 ASUCD Election, the NOW Slate and the SMART Slate were involved in election complaint controversy, aptly titled Beergate by an Users/BrentLaabs anonymous member of the public. An outlandish assessment by the Elections Committee resulted in the disqualification of candidate Alyson Noele Sagala, who was later reinstated after all allegations against all Senatorelects were dropped before being sworn in as originally planned.
