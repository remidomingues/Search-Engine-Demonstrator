 History 

There is a long history of conflict between UCD students and the police. However, the specific impetus for the committee were several alleged misconduct cases in the fall 2004 and the Sterling Riot in spring 2004. This prompted ASUCD officials to create an organized, sustained dialog between students, the city council and the police. Consequently, the Student Police Relations Committee was created in the winter quarter of 2005 by then ASUCD senate candidate Avi Singh, then ASUCD senate ASUCD Senator Donald CohenCutler and then student activist James Schwab. A bill was authored by the three and it was passed by the ASUCD Senate.

The Committee was empty and inactive until June 2005 when then Director of the ASUCD Office of External Affairs James Schwab hired the first position, Tanya Bermudez as Chair. Months later, Tanya Bermudez was offered an internship at the capital and no longer had the time to be involved in student government, so her successor, Wenche Molenaar took over the committee and then became Chair in Spring of 2006. The Student Police Relations Committee was overseen by the ASUCD Office of External Affairs until the Spring of 2006. After Spring 2006 the Committee was in limbo and without a Chair. At the end of Fall 2006 ASUCD President Darnell Holloway authored and passed legislation which changed the composition of the Committee, adding numerous officials from different areas of campus and the city.

The ASUCD Committee was ineffective from 2005 through 2006 in terms of achieving it’s purpose and has been dormant since the restructuring of ASUCD’s External Affairs division. In 2005 the City of Davis also formed a body to address studentpolice relations. The StudentPolice Relations SubCommittee of the Student Liaison Commission was charged with strengthening the relationship between the 30,000strong student population, the City of Davis and the UC Davis Police Departments. The ultimate goal of the subcommittee was to promote sustained dialogue to decrease the number of negative policestudent encounters, alert the Police Departments to student concerns, and increase student knowledge of police procedure and protocols. However, the subcommittee had also proven to be ineffective at achieving its goals for various reasons including a lack of sustained student involvement and the fact that the subcommittee was only permitted to meet on City property. The subcommittee was disbanded by the Student Liaison Commission on January 10, 2007.
