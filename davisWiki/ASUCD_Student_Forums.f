Student Forums is a disbanded ASUCD unit, originally established in 1960 to spotlight student speakers.  They later grew to bring nationally and internationally prominent speakers to UC Davis.  When Bishop Desmond Tutu spoke on the quad, there were so many people it made Picnic Day look like the last day of finals.

ASUCD started the Controversial Issues Committee in 1960, but changed the name to the Student Forums Committee in October of 1962.  The name was changed because they had difficulty booking speakers due to the Controversial Issues part of the name.  Way to go, ASUCD.

Although it declined slowly over the late 1990s, the unit was finally disbanded in 2000.

At one point in time (possibly 1995) this Unit had over a $900,000 budget (which should be distinguished from its subsidy of about $40,000) to host a largescale business conference on campus.  The event never happened.

Past Speakers:
  Desmond Tutu
  Joan Baez
  Ed Asner
  Geraldine Ferraro
  Jane Fonda

Student Forums has been recreated with a tiny budget of less than $2,000 dollars within the University Affairs unit.
