There is no such thing as a free lunch and when it comes to services provided to students, that is especially true. For example, as an Undergraduates undergraduate student you may think that taking the bus is free, but really you are paying $30.50 a quarter. This page lists some of programs that the ASUCD provides subsidies for (using undergraduate fees).

Note that the entire ASUCD Budget is also available for your browsing pleasure.
