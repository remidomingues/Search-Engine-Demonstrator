History

An eleven member Textbook Affordability Committee was http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/05/15/CampusNews/NewsIn.Brief.Senate.Approves.Creation.Of.Textbook.Affordability.Committee1996677.shtml approved by the Senate 1002 on May 15th, 2006. The new committee was to replace the ASUCD Textbook Affordability Special Committee which was considered by everyone to be unproductive the year before.  Once the Users/RobertBaron chair graduated, everyone forgot that the committee existed.

The Administrative Plan for the Textbook Affordability Committee was http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/10/30/CampusNews/Asucd.Senate.Approves.Textbook.Bill2409293.shtml approved by the Senate 1002 on October 26, 2006.
