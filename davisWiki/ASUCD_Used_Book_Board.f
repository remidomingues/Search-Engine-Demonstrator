The ASUCD Used Book Board is a board located in the Memorial Union where students can sell textbooks they no longer need. Sellers simply put the book title, class, asking price and their contact information on a little postcard and post it on the board. Prospective buyers can look at the cards and contact the seller to arrange a sale. The Used Book Board has been made obsolete with the ASUCD Book Exchange, which does a better job of selling textbooks between students.
