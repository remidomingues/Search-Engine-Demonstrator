 Historical Notes 

For most of the first sixty years of ASUCD, the Vice President served as the Chair of the Welfare Council, which gave them significantly more authority than they have now.

As a result of the Democracy at Davis constitutional amendment in Winter 1995, the Vice President became the President and Presiding Officer of the ASUCD Senate and casts the determinative vote in case of a tie.  The first Vice President to serve in this expanded capacity was Aaron Bloom.

Though Walt Estelle only served briefly as Vice President, he stayed involved in the ASCA, and was elected Representative at Large the following year (195556).

Through most of Adrian Petersens term, he was a student at Sac State rather than at UCD.  He failed out of school, applied to Sac State, and took classes there without informing ASUCD or his fraternity brothers.  This was discovered in January, and by that time the election was only a month away, so nothing was actually done about it.

    The data/info is right above you; start counting masculine/feminine names.  For the holes in the data, check the California Aggie archives, or ask SGAO to let you look at their archives.  Or ask Mark Champagne for his memories. Users/BrentLaabs, a graduate student
