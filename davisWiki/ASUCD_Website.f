The current edition of the http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/ ASUCD website was launched on 20060514, which solves most of the whining below.  It always needs work, but it uses http://plone.org/ Plone to allow many people to edit individual parts of the site  much like an accesscontrolled wiki.  SGAO is now staffed with a webmaster, so hopefully the complaint levels will stay down.  Still, ASUCD officials need to tell him/her about the events going on, or theyre just not going to be posted.

In the past, there have been a lot of complaints made about the ASUCD http://asucd.ucdavis.edu website (which is run by Creative Media).

On the evening of March 22 until the morning of March 23 the entire ASUCD network was down. That means the The California Aggie Aggies website was down as well as KDVS and their online show archiving system.

Another complaint is that documents can not be found on the website  such as bills, the budget, or upcoming agendas for Senate meetings.  During the ASUCD Senate of 2005 and onward there has been a push to make more documents available  online, but the ASUCD site often featured out of date material even then.

Another complaint is that it is out of date. Case in point:
 

The problem with this screen shot is that there are no documents for upcoming Senate meetings available. The latest document to be put online was three weeks before this screen shot was taken. And the phrase No Events Scheduled because this was the day of the Winter ASUCD Elections Forum.

Also, several of the Senators listed are no longer on the ASUCD Senate. The most drastic case would be Adam Barr who has been out of the Senate for almost three months.

In addition to all this. On February 16th, the day this screen shot was taken, there was also an ASUCD Fair going on in front of Freeborn Hall to feature the different units of the ASUCD. The fair would certainly be termed as an ASUCD Event.

 

The Senate Webpage has been updated. While this is appreciated by the student body the irony of this happening after the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election Winter Elections when eight of the senators will be out of office in a matter of days is amusing. But Creative Media is trying and that is a good thing.

 


The Senate Webpage is up to date. Creative Media had some great quick response time as they put the new  ASUCD Senate senators photos and pictures up immediately.

The new ASUCD website for http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/docs/docs.cfm?typebill Senate Bills is fantastic, I must say.  Its so much nicer having descriptions of bills available.  Good job, Alex, Kristen, and all the SGAO people.
