 The fact that youre multiple people using the same account presents the following problems:
   Accounts shared by multiple editors lack accountability. Any one of you could make an edit with this account and neither we nor you could tell with certainty who made the edit.
   Accounts shared by multiple editors help separate you guys from the rest of the community. Using this single account, you cant go around and write about your favorite thing to do at the Farmers Market or write about no toad sexing in Davis your adventures around town. Youve boxed yourselves into writing about your apartment complex alone. While your apartment complex is an important part of the community, it is by no means the only thing you guys should be writing about.
   In general, we like it when people Importance of using your RealName edit with their real names.
 Davis Wiki is not just another social media website for businesses to advertise on. Were a community and using a name like this sets you apart from us. That makes us sad. Hopefully you all understand more clearly now why we discourage collective accounts. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them of any of us. Users/WilliamLewis, a fellow Davis Wiki editor.
