Mediaworks is the media production arm of Academic Technology Services, catering to the digital media needs of campus faculty, students and staff. If you are affiliated with UC Davis and need higher end digital media services, Mediaworks may be able to help you out. Unfortunately, their services are not available to the general public. Mediaworks services can be divided into three broad categories: photography, print design, and audio/video. A full description of services is included below, but generally Mediaworks provides digital output, location, studio and scientific photography services, high end scanning from slides or reflective media, custom multimedia and design services as well as full scale digital video productions.

Thanks to ATSs Client Services & Support Group (not technically part of Mediaworks), it is really easy for campus departments to get things done through Mediaworks. Just break out that recharge number!

Mediaworks is a pretty good place for students to work, but competitive. Many of the positions start out at Assistant IV, the highest pay grade available for parttime student workers. The work generally isnt too boring, either.

 Mediaworks audio/video group 
 Video production

Mediaworks provides professional video production services for the campus. These productions range from recording lectures, symposiums, and performances of the UCDSO to televised surgery at the UCDMC and running the video screen at the Multiuse Stadium during sporting events. They have a combined television and photography studio in Surge II. The studio has a fiber optic video line that can be used to push live video out to news outlets.

 Audio studio 
Mediaworks has a small studio that can be used to record narration and participate in live radio shows via ISDN.

 Media conversion, duplication, and distribution
 Streaming media
Mediaworks can deliver their final product as streaming videos through Limelight. Live webcasts are also done, often for things like Convocation.

 Physical media 
Academic Technology Services no longer provides physical media conversions for nonATS productions. You can still request DVD copies of video produced by ATS.

Live Event Audio and Special Event Support
ATS Special Event Support can provide Audio, AV, presentation, and multimedia support for campusrelated events.

Their services include

 Sound for panel discussions
 Congress or discussion systems with 30+ microphones
 Live presentation video switching and IMAG
 Setup of Projectors and LED TVs for large events
 Projection, switching, and presentation support for several thousandattendee events

The department provides sound systems for many conferences, groundbreakings, fundraisers, concerts, and ceremonies on campus. ATS has done sound for the Silo Stage on Picnic Day for many years, and provides sound systems for the parade route and many of the smaller stages. ATS provides the video, live streaming, and presentation support for the UCDPHSA conference in October. The department has also provided the sound reinforcement for The BUZZ, HellaCapella, and ArrowJam.
