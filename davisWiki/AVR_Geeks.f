AVR Geeks was a users group for the Atmel AVR microcontroller and Arduino. The group was open to the public. They met every other week to help each other with various projects. They had a wiki of their own for posting projects: http://congo.geology.ucdavis.edu/avrgeeks/wiki/

They stopped meeting in 2012.

Meetings
Every other Wednesday from 12:302:00pm in room 3120 (Durrell Room) of the Earth & Physical Sci Bldg
