AYSO VIP stands for American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) Very Important Player (VIP) program. This program provides a quality soccer experience for children and adults whose physical or mental disabilities prevent them from successful participation on mainstream teams. The VIP program allows children with Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, visual imparements, those confined to wheelchairs, or other conditions that limit mobility, strength, and/or comprehension. The VIP season runs during the fall with a camp that runs every Sunday for 6 weeks during the summer.

Volunteers are needed to act as Buddies and/or coaches. Youth can volunteer as VIP buddies that aid players during games.
