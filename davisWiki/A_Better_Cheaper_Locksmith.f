20111104 21:44:06 nbsp I could not give Robert Parnell of A Better Cheaper Locksmith a better review. I got locked out of my apartment on a Friday night and the two locksmiths I called in Davis did not answer my calls. A very positive transaction, enough to put me in a good mood after everything was over. I got a final price ($45) right away when I called and it was so much cheaper than expected. Check this guy out, he is top notch and gets the job done right.    Users/ReginaldoBaker

20111201 20:29:35 nbsp Great Guys. Both Robert and Brian (I hope I got his name right) were friendly and professional. Showed up on time as promised, even lubricated my lock after they were done. Very Satisfy with their work. Thanks again!  Users/steven278

20111211 22:04:05 nbsp Wow, locked myself out earlier tonight. Robert and Brian (I think!) came over and quickly got my back inside my home! Really great job, and was pretty cheap for a job on a Sunday night! Glad they take jobs in Davis; I recommend them for sure.  Users/IvanCarabajal

20120218 09:29:51 nbsp This locksmith provides service above and beyond, and heres why:
I locked my keys in my car one evening in Davis. When I called Mr. Parnell, he answered immediately. Unfortunately, he wasnt able to help me that night, and his reason was definitely understandable. However, the service didnt end there. Since he couldnt be available, Mr. Parnell gave me the name and number of another locksmith out of Sacramento, and he specifically told me to drop his name so that I could get fair quote. Thanks to Mr. Parnells reference, I was treated with the utmost respect and got back into my car for a very fair price.

A Better Cheaper Locksmith is now my goto locksmith, and I would recommend them to anyone without hesitation. These guys make sure their customers are taken care of, even if they arent available for service! Thats customer service at its best! Users/JenniferEmerson

20120423 01:22:24 nbsp Bob is the best guy in town!
I locked myself out of my room and wasted a lot of time calling and waiting for some friends to come help me out. Finally I decided to call Bob. He came half an hour later.

My lock is hard to pick since its cheap and installed upside down. But with Bob, theres nothing impossible. He got it finally and even gave me discounts since he knows Im a student.

He made my day! The only thing I regret was that I didnt call him sooner. I really recommend Bob if you have any problem. Im going to give all my friends his number too :) Users/Trang

20120511 00:29:51 nbsp Got locked out of my room... because Im a troll. Bob came to my rescue in his convertible. Haha! I didnt expect my locksmith to be driving a nicer car than me...but Bob really is a very nice guy. Hes a man you can trust, so dont hesitate to call him if you get locked out. Best decision I ever made. Users/StephanieBui

20120630 20:01:21 nbsp Robert is a great locksmith and has excellent service. Called him on a Saturday after being locked out of my apartment and he came within 30 minutes. Other locksmiths charged an absurd fee for weekends but Robert was understanding and was half the price. Call Robert first before anyone else! Users/ChrisSonoda

20130110 21:44:45 nbsp My roommate and I were locked out, and Bob arrived fairly quickly. He was really nice and friendly and  best of all  it was a lot cheaper than expected! Also, I guess hes available 24 hours for locksmithing, so we highly recommend this service! Users/KelleyPaugh


20130608 23:53:39 nbsp I accidentally locked myself out of my room in the midst of finals week and Bob came on the scene very promptly after my call. Even though I installed a rather complicated lock, Bob was still able to get the job done with ease. He is a very kind man who seems like he simply loves his job and wants to pay it forward. He enjoys coming out to Davis to help the college kids. Hes aware that many of us are on a budget and offers his services at a very cheap price compared to your standard locksmith. I was very surprised someone like this exists around here and I am extremely grateful at the same time. Definitely give him a call. Users/MoniqueLivolsi

20130704 11:56:38 nbsp My girlfriend locked her keys in her car late last night, and we gave Robert Parnell a call. He came out the next morning (the Fourth of July) and had the car open in a few minutes. Great job, great price, and a nice guy, too. Id definitely recommend him. Users/KevinBensema

20130715 21:35:17 nbsp Bob is too nice. He unnecessarily gave me $5 off, so instead of paying the flat rate of $45 to set my bike free from my broken chain lock, I paid $40. He wouldnt even accept my tip. He came all the way from Elk Grove and the service took less than 10 minutes. I will definitely always go to Bob if something like this ever happens again. Other locksmiths were trying to charge me $65$85 for the same service. Thanks so much, Bob! Users/ArielLlorente

20130722 12:55:42 nbsp He does the fastest most amazing job at a great price! Very funny too!
I was locked out of my apartment and I needed to get to Berkeley within the next couple hours so he rushed over to help me out and threw in two keys for free.
couldnt have asked for a better experience.
100% recommend!!   Users/ChristineFinnigan

20130917 19:09:59 nbsp Was clumsy and locked myself out of my room while going out today, thankfully Brian was prompt in getting here all the way from Sac and took $5 off, and promised $5 additional discounts for future lockouts. Hopefully it wont come to that, but really friendly and fast service, great guy, and most of all, it was reasonably priced! Would definitely recommend, thanks! Users/LiPan

20130924 16:14:24 nbsp Amazingly flexible, quick, and professional service.  Very satisfied with their pricing and their work. Users/RYN3O

20131215 13:23:58 nbsp I had a great experience getting my locks rekeyed with Brian and Bob.  They responded quickly, arrived right on time, were efficient and fast, and the price was right.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of locksmith services. Users/MikiTobini

20140810 15:42:55 nbsp My keys were stolen and the guys came out within 15 minutes of my calling him and rekeyed both doors in under a half an hour! Very friendly and professional, and definitely affordable. Two doors and three keys for under $100! Users/KaitlinMurphy
