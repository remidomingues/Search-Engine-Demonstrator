The classes are a lot of fun and free except for the cost of materials! Users/GreenThing

The staff are very helpful and if you dont know how to finish your bracelet/necklace, they will help you add the clasp.  This is great for inept people like me!  Users/CalamityJanie

20090416 16:23:06 nbsp The beads here are incredibly overpriced if youre looking for elastic string or pony beads. Id recommend WalMart before this place, unless you want to pay about ten times (literally) what you would otherwise. Users/CCorinne

20090416 17:11:58 nbsp I have not been there in quite some time, but I think the point of going to a place like this is largely that you pay only for the beads you use and therefore have to get much less.  Besides that they have to keep someone there all day which means they have to make at the bare minimum enough to pay that persons salary.  Its unfair to say that the beads are more expensive here than at WalMart in the same way as it is to say not to shop at grocery stores because meat, etc. is cheaper at Costco.   Users/MasonMurray

20090422 15:42:57 nbsp If youd read my post, Mason, youd see that I wasnt commenting on their single beads, but on the ones they sold IN BULK, along with their bulk string.

So yes, Im saying that if you want to buy a larger quantity of cheap beads, go to a different store. I think this information is just as important as your appreciation for the store. Users/CCorinne

20090525 11:58:38 nbsp My biggest problem with this place is that if you forget your discount card (which gives you $10 off after spending $50) they refuse to give you another one, so you can combine them (most other store I have been to will do this for you). When I asked them if I could just have them put my purchase on a new one (I had just spent over $20) they said No we want to save paper. How rude! Its one little tiny square, dont say that if you just are trying to save money. It left me peeved. Other than that, the selection of beads is nice, and its very helpful how you can buy them individually. Users/KristenM

20090803 18:34:42 nbsp Sorry Corrine, but Mason has a point.  If you dont mind that a place like WalMart keeps its prices low by treating its people like ,then buy your inexpensive beads there.  However, you are right about ABPBs bulk prices.  I suggest that you try Michaels instead and keep a little more of your soul.  They have a nice selection of standard findings too. Users/jlheelan

20090911 20:27:55 nbsp Staff is incredibly helpful and the classes they offer are really great. Users/arynkoo

20090924 20:39:21 nbsp Theres no point in removing comments here, as itll just get reverted. But I think it is incredibly lame  and everyone pretty much knows it  when somebody makes a comparison between any locallyowned small business and a bigbox retailer. If you like big stores like WalMart, Target, Home Depot, etc., then by all means shop there. If price is all that matters to you, drive far, far away to buy your little beads. But it is pretty pointless to make those kind of comparisons without also discussing the service, quality, selection, and the hard work that goes into running a small retail business.
This is a great store. I always enjoyed browsing through it with my kids when they were younger, and I continue to hear excellent things about their selection and service.  Users/DonShor

20100201 18:08:33 nbsp Comparing the beads and the beading experience at WalMart with the beads at BPB is like comparing apples and oranges...sure WalMart sells beads, as does BPB, but there the comparison ends.  BPB carries a wide selection of very high quality beads and findings and the owners and their staff are always helpful.  Any jewelry that is made will reflect the type of beads that are used...cheap beads, cheap jewelry; quality beads, quality jewelry! Users/dpaige

20100201 18:19:43 nbsp I dont think shopping at WalMart for beads is a good idea.  The quality really isnt there.  With beading the vast majority of the value comes from your work, not from bead value.  Sinking hours into a project only to have it look like crap when youre done because you bought your supplies at Wallyworld is really shortsighted.

If youre into bead stores, this is a great place to go.  Compared to other small bead stores like this, the prices are very comparable.  The classes are a real bargain (in that theyre free) and the staff is helpful and friendly. Users/rfrazier

20101226 23:39:14 nbsp I looked on their website and it says the classes are now 10$, not including supplies. Im not sure if this was just for November or if this is a new fee for every class. Users/jenb

20110702 16:37:51 nbsp Its gone! D: I walked down to it now and its no longer there! Its a photography studio. Does anyone know if it moved? Or did it go out of business?! I am very sad that its no longer there. I really hope it just relocated. Users/BMarsh
  They moved around the corner from where they used to be (see the picture at the top of this page). Users/JenniferCook

20110716 18:23:30 nbsp Wonderful place for a personal gift! The two days Ive spent in there I havent seen any other man, eh? You should get down there and make something special for your loved one :D Users/MichaelNielsen
