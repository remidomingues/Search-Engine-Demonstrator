The A Bus Line is a long Unitrans route servicing Downtown, 5th Street, Alhambra Drive and Mace Blvd. It provides service twice an hour during the day to the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal. Due to high passenger loads during the morning, two buses will be deployed to handle the extra passengers. The first bus will stop at the regular stops while a second bus serves the large number of passengers at the Greystone and DMV stops.
