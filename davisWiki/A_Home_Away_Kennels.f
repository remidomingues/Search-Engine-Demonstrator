20070212 12:40:58 nbsp You know, Ive been there, tried a few times and both times have had bad experiences. I mean, you cant be $12 per day, you just cant. But every time Ive gone they have forgotten to give back toys, bones, harnesses, etc that I brought with my dog. At first I thought well, give them some grace, but it has happened more than once. Also the lady is not the most friendly. I mean I realize that some animal people are not people people, but I guess I like thinking my dog is going to be in a happy place and I havent really gotten that vibe. Anyone else been there and had a good experience?? I wish I had better things to say because its local and affordable. SoCalGal

20070326 13:49:33 nbsp Ive left my dog here twice and had no complaints either time.  The kennels are roomy, the atmosphere is rural and pleasant, and if your dog gets along with others he/she gets to go out for group play and exercise.  They may not be people people but they seem to do just fine with dogs; what else do you need?  They did lose a toy the first time but a $5 toy isnt much against knowing your dog is in a decent place and being cared for well.  They seem to be very conscientious about the health and welfare of the animals. JulieSimpson

20080123 16:12:13 nbsp I would not recommend this kennel.  We left our dog here over a long weekend.  When we dropped her off DURING OPERATING HOURS the woman who admitted her seemed extremely agitated that we were even there.  She was NOT NICE.  The kennels looked shoddy and not very clean.  I had serious doubts about leaving my dog there at that point but unfortunately it was too late.  We picked up our pooch after 5 days at this kennel and took her home...where for the next 45 days she had extremely bad diarrhea.  We ended up having to take her to the vet less than 24 hours after we picked her up from the kennel.  We still dont know why she was so ill.  When we called the kennel to see if they had noticed anything they said they hadnt and that she seemed fine (even though we could see diarrhea stains on her dog bed that she had used at the kennel).  We will not be going there again.  There are TONS of other kennels in the Davis/Woodland area if you look (not all are here on the daviswiki though) that are way better and only slightly more costly.  In the end, after the vet bill, the doggie medicine, the steam cleaner and the food for our dogs modified diet during her sickness we spent way more money at this cheap place than we would have at a different kennel.  We wont be sending our dog back here.  We found a better place (listed on daviswiki actually).  Users/recoveringPhD

20080213 08:47:52 nbsp We always take our dog. No they are not people friendly but they always seem happy to see our dog. Yes, you do tend to lose smaller items you bring, especially if you are boarding the dog for over a week but really the price makes up for that. recoveringPhD, did you bring your dogs food with you to the kennel? Our dog has a very sensitive stomach and we noticed she had really bad diarrhea after being boarded there once so we started bringing our own food and she is always fine now. Users/Likakana

20080213 17:44:59 nbsp Likakana, we did bring our own dog food.  Our dog is also a little sensitive to changes in diet so we always make sure to bring her food (as well as extra in case we are delayed).  Regardless of the diarrhea situation I just didnt feel comfortable leaving her there and I just didnt like the kennel.  Im glad to hear that your pup does well there though. Users/recoveringPhD

20080920 07:43:04 nbsp We left our cat here a few years ago...and I learned a valuable lesson  always check out a kennel before you decide to leave your pet there.  The kennels did not seem heated or that clean...I did not want to leave my cat there, but we had a plane to catch and little choice.  The cat was fine when we picked him up, I would just never leave him here again. Users/AcMach

20080929 19:52:00 nbsp We brought our dog here a few times, and weve never been totally happy with it. After taking poochie there over this weekend, we will not be going back. For one, the bag of food that was returned to us was almost as full as it was when we dropped it off. Our dog is not exactly a picky eater, so it appears that they neglected to feed him adequately. This is not the first time that has happened. We also paid extra  for play times, but every time weve picked him up, he has had tons and tons of energy. Ive also noticed that the same three dogs, presumably the owners, are in the play field every time I go there. Ive never seen any other dog in there! Anyways, its a good deal, but ultimately is not worth it to us any more. Users/ifoundthistape

20090821 10:45:39 nbsp I have boarded my dog there a couple of times and will do so again.  It is an older kennels, but I found them to be clean and very shaded with lots of trees.  I feed my dog twice a day and they had no problem with that. The lady was quiet with me but  friendly towards my dog, which is more important.   Users/sah133

20100329 17:51:04 nbsp I left both my large dogs there for three nights.  I would agree that the kennels dont appear especially clean, and everything is really old and broken down.  However, the owners are friendly and it looks like they also live on the property.  My dogs came back just fine...a little dirty and stircrazy, but thats to be expected when they are thrown into a different environment for 72 hours.  And, you cant beat the price.  Ive also read on here that they dont return toys and what not, but the owner was very careful to make sure everything we brought was given back.  I would use them again if needed!  Users/scompton15

20110106 18:03:29 nbsp I have used this facility since 2005. Originally I came here because they have such BIG kennels, with plenty of room for the dogs to move, and in and outdoors during the day.  I HATE facilities where the dog is in a cage most of the day.  The bottom line for me is that my dog always jumped with joy when we got there, and readily went off with the owner.  YES, the owners not the least bit people friendly, and is rather intimidating ... but shes dog friendly.  As they got to know the dog, they had her spend more and more time playing with other dogs, reporting to me how she got along well with x dog or Y dog.  (The front yard is for their own dogs, the back yard is where boarded dogs play.)  As my dog got older and more and more frail, they were kind to her.  They changed her sheets and blankets when she got sick (returning personal soiled items in a plastic bag). In all those years there she only got sick once.  The owner never learned MY name, but she sure knew my dog lol.  A couple of years ago the owners husband passed away very suddenly.  They nevertheless did not leave the kennel unattended for any time.  Rather they made sure they had coverage.  That for me beats a fancy place where they go home at five and dont come back till the next morning. I have NEVER seen a cage dirty there, and I show up at any time during the day to drop off or pick up.  Yes, I have a love/hate relationship with the place  worry about whether theyre too hot or too cold etc, but as long as my dog is happy to go there, I figure she knows best.  FWIW I dont spoil my dogs, but I do love them and give them lots of affection and care.  Theyre indoor dogs who stay with me most of the day.  PS: My prior dog passed away at 15, so I havent been there in a year.  I am taking a new dog there for a week. My new dog is a bit more finicky so I will see how she gets along.  If there is any change to how I feel about the place I will repost Users/SandraDann

20110820 22:05:46 nbsp I dont reccomend this place. The ladies there are pretty rude and didnt seem to care for my elderly dog. My dog was scared to go there and she basically got dragged into her cage. The room behind the desk area is a cold dark cement room with lots of dirty cages. Many times my dog has come back with bad diarhhea, and they didnt bother to tell us that until we got home. The cat cages, my... they are the worst. They are wire and both my cats paws got callused and sore. They were both skinnier, dirtier, and not happy at all. There was also some confusion as to who was getting helped and who had what animal. They didnt understand we had 1 dog and 2 cats, so we had to explain to the lady that we did, and she just looked at us like we were crazy. Bottom line cheap pricemessy/unwelcoming place for the animalsgo elsewhere!  Users/Churro615
