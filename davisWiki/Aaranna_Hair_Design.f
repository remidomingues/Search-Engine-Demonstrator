20100714 14:24:26 nbsp I have dry n damaged hair and have never been completely satisfied after getting my hair done. After coming out of Aarannas I loved my hair! I loved the cut and my color..prices are fair for the over all look. Very friendly and convienent. I will be returning to get my daughters ears pierced and my sisters eyebrows waxed.  Users/jbm85

20100727 13:46:04 nbsp 20100727:  The next time you need anything done with your hair, do yourself a favor and go to see Nooria at Aarannas.  She not only does great styling, cutting, and color, but her prices are more than reasonable and she herself is such a kind and very interesting person to talk to.  Ive been going there for about three years, and I look forward to the experience whenever I go.  Barbara Drushell Users/BarbaraDrushell

20100731 17:25:07 nbsp I dont know whether the haircuts here are good haircuts or great haircuts.  I go here all the time because Nooria is very nice and its like getting a haircut from professional who is also a friend. I trust her and her prices are good.  Users/GregKuperberg

20100731 20:24:47 nbsp Just went here today  my hair is adorable! Great cut and great prices.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20100803 18:27:18 nbsp I can personally attest to both Nooria and Faridas expertise.  Ive used their waxing, threading, and hair cutting services.  I have been satisfied each time I go, since the job is done thoroughly, with thought and care.  Also both are fabulous people that engage in conversation so as to personalize the experience.  :)

20100816 22:30:29 nbsp My friend Parisa and I went to Aaranna to get our eyebrows waxed and to get a haircut. Both Farida (also known as Fara) and Nooria did our haircuts and our eyebrow wax. They did a great job on our haircuts and I definitely recommend Aaranna Hair Design. If you want the best eyebrow shape you should go to Aaranna because both Nooria and Fara are Persian and they know how to shape eyebrows well.  Users/SerenaBhagirath

20100829 20:57:08 nbsp Very happy with service! I have been going here for eyebrow waxing and haircuts for about four years. I also bring my 5 yr old for haircuts. Its very kid friendly, I also have a 1 and half yr old and theres a train set that keeps her busy the whole time. They do not do nails here so there is no chemical smells to worry about with the kids. I would and do recommend to friends and family.

20101016 13:39:40 nbsp I walked in today and I was extremely pleased! I went in for an eyebrow threading and Fara did an amazing job!! I told her what I wanted and she spent a ton of time on me, making sure that my brows looked exactly as I wanted them. I am definitely going back in the future and Im going to recommend this salon to all my friends in Davis. Users/KathrynAzarvand

20101029 15:13:53 nbsp I saw Nooria a few weeks ago and my hair came out great.  I would defiantly recommend her. Users/JulieTodd

20101106 22:16:11 nbsp I had my first color ever, and Nooria did an amazing job. I showed her 12 pictures, and she knew the look I wanted. Really great! Also, the quality of work for the prices for her services is way better than the more expensive salons in Downtown Davis. Users/Stephie

20101112 12:35:34 nbsp Ive been going here for almost 5 months now and Faras work is just perfect. I recommend her to everyone :)
Users/AmirHassan

20101215 20:28:39 nbsp Ive gone to Aaranna twice and have gotten my hair cut and colored, and my eyebrows shaped and her (Noorias) service is amazing! Walking into Aaranna is like walking into a friends house  although this friend is amazing at doing hair! Theres a group of five girls at my high school who rely on and are more than satisfied with this place  service is wonderful, staff is nice, and prices are more than reasonable  its a gem! Users/KatieWynne

20110101 11:34:08 nbsp I wont let anyone else cut my hair except for Nooria at Aaranna! She cuts and styles it exactly like I want.  She has introduced me to new products that have made my dry hair shiny and soft! She does a fantastic job and is a wonderful person as well! I recommend her most highly. Users/RShahrokh

20110502 14:02:35 nbsp Nooria did a BEAUTIFUL job on my hair. The cut is fantasticfun, bouncy, pretty, and exactly what I wanted. She was professional and very nice, and really took her time on styling my hair and making sure I was happy. And the price was excellent! West Davis is out of the way for me (although Westlake Plaza is right on D & K lines), but it was so worth it. Ill definitely go back next time. Remember to bring cash or check, and while they do take walkins, Id recommend calling ahead. Users/zombiek

20110602 19:28:19 nbsp Went to Nooria today for a haircut and eyebrow waxing. The entire experience was great, was able to make an appointment day of and was seen on time. Nooria asked me several times while cutting my hair how short I would like it, which I really appreciated. She did an excellent job on both my haircut and my eyebrows in particular which must have been quite a task for her considering how out of control they were before :) Overall, great experience, I went to Aaranas because of the plethora of excellent reviews here and am happy to add one of my own to the list. Users/desireea

20110909 22:24:42 nbsp I have had my hair cut by Nooria a few times now and every time she has done a wonderful job! She is quick but really takes care of you. She even gave me a free eyebrow wax! Users/ElizabethBrown

20110922 12:29:30 nbsp I had Nooria (from Aaranna Hair Design) do my hair for my wedding this past August.  She was wonderful, patient and thorough.  I wanted to do an updo/side bun for my wedding, and we had a trial first back in May. She looked at the pictures I brought in and did my hair just like I wanted.  She was very accommodating, and even came in on a Sunday to do my hair and my bridesmaids hair before my wedding day began. I told her I was nervous about my hair falling out of the updo because my hair is very fine/silky, and she used a great hair product on me  it didnt even budge during my whole outdoor wedding! I would highly recommend using Nooria if you are trying to find a stylist for your wedding day.  Although the shop is a bit small if you have a huge wedding party, her prices are way cheaper than any salon in downtown Davis, and its worth the few minutes drive to go to her. Users/MFerreira

20111015 15:26:13 nbsp I went into Aaranna Hair Design today for the first time for an eyebrow wax. I typically get my brows done at nail salons, and wasnt sure what to expect from Aarannas. When I walked in I was surprised at how small the salon was, as well as how empty it was. My only complaint was that Aarannas lacked a waxing bed, so I had to sit in a regular hair cutting chair with my neck cranked back. It was uncomfortable, but Nooria did a very thorough and great job on my brows. Even as I was paying she was looking at them to make sure they were good, and plucked a little more. I definitely plan to go back for a haircut, because I can see Nooria taking the same care and effort with my hair as she did with my brows. Will definitely recommend to friends! A very friendly and comfortable environment. Users/teresamary

20120123 20:37:57 nbsp Ive been going here to get my brows waxed for around a year and theyre AMAZING! Nooria is so friendly every time I go in, she always manages to find time for me even if she has a lot of scheduled appointments (Im terrible about being a walk in, I should really start making appointments). I love the work they do there, I wont go anywhere else until I have to leave Davis. Users/Hastings1066

20120129 23:42:24 nbsp I am so happy I found this place! I had my hair in bad shape and Nooria did such a good job on cutting it so that it can look fuller and healthy. The prices for my cut and color were very reasonable compared to the high prices in the area. Not only that but she takes her time to get it right and making sure that she is meeting your expectations. She was very kind and definitely not trying to sell you more than what you needed. I highly recommend this place. I recently went and only did it because I read the reviews she had, it was totally worth it and will be coming back here again! Users/GYani

20120303 20:36:26 nbsp Went there today for a cut and wax. Nooria was very nice and did a great job, I only wish that they took debit/credit cards. Users/NyssaSpector

20120326 17:11:02 nbsp Two months ago, I went to Pomegranate in Downtown (expensive salon) where I got a really short hair cut, the hair dresser did an alright job: however, I LOVE my hair cut from Aarannas more, especially considering I got a similar hair cut at Pomegranate with the biggest difference being that I paid twice (almost three times!) as much for HALF the volume I have curly hair. Aarannas is very flexible on time too (I changed the appointment twice). Highly recommended for good quality at affordable prices : Users/carolinaibarramendoz

20120401 09:15:20 nbsp Last night I went to Nooria for the first time. She had kindly fit me in at the last minute before a hot date (because my usual hairstylist, the fabulous Thomas Lea of Hello Gorgeous, had an emergency and had to cancel my appt). Nooria did a BEAUTIFUL job coloring my hair! It is perfect. And very resonably priced. Thank you, thank you, Nooria!  Users/Chamoudah

20120504 09:49:02 nbsp I had a mishap with my hair and I needed a quick fix! She managed to fit me into her schedule and spent 3 hours in and out working on my stubborn hair. In the end, she was able to fix it and for much less then I thought it would be. She was extremely nice and knew what she was doing!!! I would highly recommend Nooria and I will be going back for all my hair needs!  Users/Rebecka

20120510 14:52:38 nbsp I have been getting my hair cut and colored by Nooria for several years.   Many people ask me where I get my hair styled and I am always confident when referring them to Nooria.  I love the products she uses on my hair.  Even though I have my hair colored once a month, my hair is never dry or damaged.  I have very sensitive skin and she suggested I have my brows threaded instead of waxing.  Now I always have threading on my brows and facial hair as it is much kinder to my skin.  Nooria is always welcoming and so interesting to talk to.  I enjoy the time I spend with her.  Another great advantage is the location.  Parking is so convenient  not like trying to find parking in downtown Davis.  I love this place.  Billie Dunbar

20120608 14:55:45 nbsp I got a haircut and deep conditioning here recently both were great! Very good prices, Nooria is super sweet, and my hair looked just the way I wanted it. Users/SarahBon

20120818 18:19:32 nbsp I just got my first cut and was very pleased.  Nooria is very kind and I enjoyed talking with her. What a great cut and style for the price! Users/LisaKlewicki

20121005 19:12:00 nbsp I went to Aaranna to get highlights and perm by Nooria who was recommended to me by my friend. Nooria did a great job and I am in love with my hair. The perm looks very natural and the highlights are exactly what I wanted. Nooria is very smart and talented. I really recommend her, even if you’re not sure what to do with your hair she will help you and you will not be disappointed by her work. I am very satisfied by her work. Users/VanessaCop

20130114 14:25:49 nbsp I was able to schedule a same day appointment with Nooria, which I always appreciate. She did a great job on my highlights, the color and the placements were both spot on. I am even happier, because Ive been charged literally twice as much as she charged for the same results! Users/kelseycee

20130315 15:55:06 nbsp I got my hair highlighted last week by Nooria. It looks gorgeous! It looks very natural. I get a lot of compliments. Users/teri.m

20130324 15:31:08 nbsp My daughter got her hair styled at Aaranna for her junior prom. She was very pleased with the results. It turned out exactly as she had wanted and held up all day and night!
And because she was spending her own money, she was also pleased with how reasonable the price was! I would definitely recommend Aaranna to anyone looking for a wedding or prom stylist.  Users/LynBigelow

20130505 15:28:15 nbsp Had a great experience at Noorias salon. She fit in my daughter late on a Saturday prom night, and she slaved until 8:30 to get the dye job done just the way my daughter wanted it. She is very accommodating. We will be returning! :) Users/FayeAK

20130731 11:29:49 nbsp  I go to Nooria for brow waxing because she does the best job of anyone in town for the most reasonable price. I have gotten my brows waxed many, many times at various salons and waxing joints all over town, in San Francisco, and elsewhere, and I have never been as satisfied with the end result as I am now. Same day appointments are also great, since I usually dont think about my brows until I am desperate! In fact, I am going in today. Thank you, Nooria!  Users/shannahw

20131106 19:29:21 nbsp I read comments on line and made an appointment for a gloss and cut.  I ended up adding my first ever low lights.  I am really happy with both the cut and the color.  Jan Users/janpeiffer

20140106 20:35:11 nbsp I am soo happy I found this place! Nooria is excellent with hair and always does such a great job and gives really good tips and advice for maintaining healthy hair and making the style last as long as possible. Id gotten a perm here before and I absolutely loved it! It was perfect and lasted almost four months. Today I came in to get it touched up and ended up getting a cute new hair cut and flawless curls!  Not only that, but after seeing Nooria do such an amazing job on another customers hair (she dyed her hair from really dark shiny brown/black to a deep magenta/burgandy red without bleaching it!) I might just be back in a week or so to get my own hair colored! Aaranna Hair Design is my go to hair salon where I can always expect to get perfect movie star hairstyles while maintaining its health, shine, and moisture for an awesome price! Thank you Nooria! Users/SamiHB

20140602 18:02:00 nbsp Nooria has been doing my short, dyed hair and my daughters long, wavy hair for two years. Nooria is the best! Users/Chamoudah
