Aarolye is a middle name for me, because AMY LEE is just too much of a common name to make a screen name of! Anyways, Ive lived in California for about 7 years, hanging out in Santa Cruz and the Bay Area. Before that I used to live in Chicago and in Barrington, Illinois (where the rich kids do drugs because they have nothing else to do with their money). Anywho, I miss the snow sometimes.

Well, since Ive moved so many times my whole life, even now, I havent been able to settle down on a main focus in my life. Ive played instruments varying from violin, piano, saxaphone and such. I was bored so I learned some French, Spanish, Sign Language, and Japanese.

My pet peeves are Chinese people and annoying people who dont have common sense.


20080403 10:42:22 nbsp Actually, the reason that sockpuppetry is being suspected is pretty obvious.  You and MooMoo are sharing the same Comcast IP address which appears to be a home address.  One is a real name and one isnt.  You should see what some other people (including some business owners) try to get away with!  :)  Dont worry about it; you both just popped up at the same time and it certainly looked odd.  Next winter Ill send you snow if you send me sunshine (actually, Ill probably get some snow in the next couple weeks). Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
