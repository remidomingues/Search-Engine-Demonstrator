Their Apex Cycles Bike Shop moved to 912 5th street in November, 2012. 

Happy, go Lucky... Always willing to help.

Email Aaron with any Bicycle related questions. aaron@apexcycles.com.

Aaron came to Davis in 1997 to attend UC Davis on a full scholarship from The Buck Foundation.  During college, Aaron worked at a few of the downtown Bike Shops in addition to The Paint Chip, Mobile Connections, Jamba Juice, Cafe Roma, The Logical Learning Center, DM Information Systems, Inc., and Pak Mail. Aaron is very proud to say that he has never been unemployed for longer than 3 days (one time in 2004) since he was 14yrs old and that many of his jobs overlapped one another.

When hes not at his Apex Cycles Bike Shop, he can be found riding bikes with his kids around town.

Aaron and his boys train in Brazilian JiuJitsu, KaJuKenpo and Escrima.

Aaron prizes above all else, proper communication and respect.  A little known fact is that Aaron was adopted from Cambodia (even though everyone asumes hes from the Philippines) at the age of 3 by a retired Catholic Priest, and raised Jewish.

Aaron and his family are active members of the Davis community and can be found at most local functions especially if bikes are involved.  Aaron usually donates his time whenever a bike race or school bike safety rodeo needs a mechanic.  Aaron also works for the North Natomas TMA and is an outside sales rep for various brands in the bicycle industry for Hawaii.

If you happen to get a bike flat somewhere in town and happen to see his silver Honda Ridgeline or white Honda minivan with APEX stickers, he always carries tools, a pump and spare tubes.  Hell even give you a lift if needed.

Hey, want a challenge you wont be able to fix (no shop in Northern California has been able to help me, including all the usual suspects in Davis bike church,bike exchange, places in sac, etc)? I have a 4 speed sturmey archer from a moulten that is from early 60s and has working full suspension, the piece that goes in the center of the sturmey (axle thingy) snapped... I really want to get this bike working again cause its just awesome and utterly classic... Users/StevenDaubert

P.S. give the students there fixie fix and when it slows down and you want a real challenge I will bring my moulten thru. I honestly dont expect you to succeed where every bike shop for 50 miles hasnt, but its still worth a shot! Users/StevenDaubert

20081020 21:05:49 nbsp Hello Aaron. Thank you very much for your offer! Actually we have been working with a couple artists about showcasing their work in our shop. However, nothing will be confirmed until November. I shall let you know as soon as I find out!  Users/Sagat

20081209 19:18:28 nbsp sounds great! Users/StevenDaubert

20081213 07:38:46 nbsp No problem.  Ive been meaning to mention that there are some issues with that layout on smaller monitors, with the images on the left and right top pinching the text.  You might want to move the ones on the left down to the text.  Its not a tremendously big deal, but if you have your browser window sized certain ways (or have certain resolution screens), it can look odd and hard to read (the table gets squeezed).  I think I fixed it awhile back, and you migrated the photos back up over time, but I never bothered to fix it again, as its not a terrible problem.  When it gets really small, the table pops to below the photos. Users/JabberWokky

20090731 10:07:57 nbsp Well, the first thing that comes to mind when setting any event up is the audience. First off, what kind of crowds it brings. Understandably that would be the biking community. However, there is that secondary issue of the moneymaking community. My worry is the legitimacy of this sort of event. There would have to be a way to make sure that parts being traded and sold are not illegally obtained. What is to stop someone from stealing a random bike earlier in the day, breaking it apart, and then selling the nonlicensed parts? When a bike is licensed via TAPS or whatnot, it is licensed as a whole. That is just a random thought that comes to mind (evil minds arent necessarily evil themselves). Reputable vendors would need to be contacted and nonreputable vendors would need to be verified. However, the perfect venue would be Central Park. It is close to most places people bike near/to so that works out pretty well for the people who somehow arent reached by advertising methods. As far as advertising, that is the easy part. With enough time (but not too much time), the internet, flyers, word of mouth, and calling in favors is how it is done (at least in my world). I could easily help with that part if you need. But frankly, I think it is a great idea if only the people buying and selling were people at manned booths with a background that is traceable. I think the idea that someone can walk up off the street and sell something to someone other person off the street is a bit tricky if there is an altercation. Otherwise, great idea. It would need to be brainstormed more, but yeah. Let me know if you want my help. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090914 14:58:00 nbsp Hey Aaron, I have a cheap mountain bike, the pedals have some movement that they shouldnt have (its kinda up and down, as if they arent seated with the axle or whatnot) I have another exact copy of the same cheap bike that doesnt have the problem... How do I swap / repair? Users/StevenDaubert
 Upon further reflection I think Im going to just unbend the other bikes bent derailer hanger and then move the good derailer onto the old bike... How much do you want for use of a chain breaker onsite @ apex ?

20090922 08:51:57 nbsp Others might disagree, but I think the reason to keep those brief is because the page is a directory pointing people to the more detailed entries about each shop or resource.  The text should be however long it takes to distinguish each for somebody scanning over the list looking for something particular. Users/JabberWokky

20091212 11:36:28 nbsp I went and asked for wiki:wikispotCommunity Guidelines/Business promotion questions/Talk clarification. Hopefully the answer will make things clearer for everyone.

  Nope... they stole it.  The compressor in question is the one that I left a hose outside for people to use anytime.  If the chuck is removed, the hose leaks and makes a huge racket with the compressor constantly running and trying to fill the tank.  So they new what they were doing as it would be instantaneous loud obnoxious noise.  When I came to the shop in the morning, the compressor was still running (and overheating) so I had to unplug it.  Its too bad really, as many people came by and used it on a regular basis.  Users/Aaron.Curtin

  I worked At DM Info, when it was independently owned.  Not a horrible job, but not the best for a college student with an short attention span (in my case).  Mainly worked on the Aerojet litigation.  Too much time in front of a computer screen.  They did have free ice cream sandwiches in the employee lounge though ;)  As for TB, yeah... try to not go there more than 2x a month... lesser of 2 evils when compared to Jack in the Box.

20130625 11:14:44 nbsp Aaron, I see that http://daviswiki.org/T%26M_Bike_Shop?actiondiff&version24&version13 this negative comment was left from the same IP addresses IP address that you yourself used, just minutes before, to make edits on the same page, a competitors page.  I dont think of you as the sort of businessman who would engage in that sort of sockpuppets sockpuppeting against a potential competitor.  Can you clarify? Users/CovertProfessor

  I usually use the other handle when I dont want things directly tied to me.  But I left nothing negative.  Statement of facts.  wiki (which I based my visit on) and sign in the window said open at 10. I got There at 10:30.  They werent there so I left after waiting for about 20 minutes because I had to get to the shop and open myself.  Called numerous times when I got to my shop and they didnt get in until noon.  I realize thyre new, and wanted to see what They had to offer.  Nothing out of the ordinary or to differentiate themselves from any of the other shops.  I have yet to test their bike knowledge, but time will tell. Users/Aaron.Curtin
   Aaronnot sure youre seeing the point. It isnt your job to test them...also saying 1st impressions not too great. is definitely a negative statement. Why dont you focus on your bike business.  If your product and services are good enough to fulfill the community needs, you shouldnt have to worry about what other businesses are doing. Users/PeteB

  Not open, next to nothing for sale... these Are all Things I had to deal with years ago.  Are they reliable, not sure, but considering what limited experience Ive had with then, Id say not so.  It is my place to see what other business are doing as all the bike shops in town are not only in friendly competition, but also part of the cycling community as a whole.  We rely on each other for parts, tools or advice.  If I cant use them as such why should anyone else?  1st impression not too great.  I didnt mention that there were 2 other potential customers there that were waiting that left.  I never mentioned to them that I owned a shop or to go anywhere else.  I let them formulate that opinion on their own.  This was my experience and within my right to voice it.  I have since removed all association with the other handle and posted under my REAL name,  Feel free to talk to me in person anytime.  You can find me at my shop during regular POSTED business hours unless Im at lunch, but Id be willing to schedule an appointment if youd like.  Aaron
   Thank you for correcting your attempt to hide behind a false name, however, if I come to Davis Ill shop elsewhere. Attempts like yours kill my faith in businesses.  Users/PeteB

  Attempt at what? Are you implying something, because it would be better if you just came out and said what you are thinking rather than beat around the bush.  If you do decide to come to Davis, fell free to shop elsewhere.  Better yet, check Daviswiki, youll find many useful reviews and customer feedback in regards to me and my business practices.  Im not perfect, nor did I ever claim to be, but as far as bikes are concerned, you wont find anyone better.  That said, I do reserve the right to refuse service as well.  Aaron

20130625 13:48:45 nbsp Not trying to air your personal business, but that comment reads very differently coming from you vs. a customer. Users/CovertProfessor

  Regardless if you were or not, you did, and that was what I was trying to avoid in the first place.   Aaron
   Im not getting it.  You were the one who revealed the information about yourself and your family.  Not sure why it airs your personal business to say that you were the one who wrote it.  cp

  I changed it to my real name to apease the DWgods... at the time it was meant to be anonymous. By you reveling that it was me, you outed me and aspects of my personal life that I was not comfortable with at the time.  Why is that so hard for you to understand considering you dont even use your own real name when editing the wiki?  Aaron
   Aaronagain youre not getting it, man. No matter what you do on the Wikianyone can see by the IPs that you were the same person posting from both accounts. You outed yourself. Please stop blaming others for what you set yourself up for. Users/PeteB
   Youll just have to take my word for it  I genuinely dont understand.  I can see why you wouldnt use your own name when commenting on a business, although I think its shady when you do it while critiquing a competitor (and hey, everyone else can see that it was a critique but you).  But I truly dont understand the comment on your own page.  Using your pseudonym, you wrote, In response to all the recent questions and concerns about the shop. I have to say that this is still one of the best little bike shops around. They are going through some tough times right now as it is a family business and I overheard one of the volunteers mentioning that Aaron has been dealing with his mothers Alzheimers and has had to close the shop periodically to deal with that. I rolled past tonight, and there he was working late into the night to try and make up for not being open during the day. He said he wont be around again tomorrow since he has to follow up with doctors and find an assisted living facility for his mother. If you need to get something done with your bike, hes still one of the best local resources. He hopes that all his loyal customers understand and that he will try to have the shop up and running regular hours by the middle of the week. Feel free to call him or shoot him an email with any questions.  That comment in itself revealed your personal life about you caring for your mother; I didnt do it.  My saying it was you who wrote it lets people know that youre willing to pretend to be a customer who says praiseworthy things about your own business.  Sorry, that doesnt reflect well on you.  I can see that you were going through a bad time, so I am sympathetic  but still, it was not the right thing to do.  So, who is in the wrong here  the person who sockpuppeted about his own business, pretending to be a customer who said it was one of the best little bike shops around, or the person who pointed out the other persons bad behavior?   Users/CovertProfessor

  @ CP, I understand your point on that, and during that time I WAS going through a lot, dealing with my 90 year old Fathers failing health, and my mothers Alzheimers, while raising my young family and running my business.  More than any 30 year old should have to endure. For that I apologize. But this more recent use of my formerly anonymous account was strictly for reference without being targeted as biased.  As anyone who really knows me as a person, not just as a business entity, they will tell you that I dont have a malicious bone in my body.  @ PeteB, youre blowing it out of proportion.  And I may have inadvertently outed myself via IP addresses, but that shred of anonymity was lost when CP posted who I was.  Even if its one click away, at least there was another step to hide who I was.  I dont have to answer to any of you.  Ive been in business for 7 years, Ill be here as long as I want.  I have wholeheartedly supported the Daviswiki, financially and in spirit, but today its over.  I have touted to other local business owners the benefits of the wiki to deaf ears.  Now I share their sentiment as it has grown into a circle jerk of moderators  Aaron
   Aaron, youve been a valued member of the DavisWiki for many years.  Thats why I was so surprised to see you sockpuppet a competitor today.  I think maybe you need to take a step back, maybe ask some people not involved with the wiki what they think, and really reflect on whether its right to do what you did today on a competitors business page.  I think youll see that you ought not to have done that.  No one is trying to come down hard on you.  In fact, notice that no one has written anything on your business page about this.  To be clear, I am not making a threat (I have no intention of making such an edit), but pointing out that editors have in fact been fairly gentle with your behavior, behavior that has always been frowned upon.  Youve been editing the wiki long enough to know that sockpuppeting a business is not acceptable.  Id like to see you continue to edit the wiki in a productive way, as you always have in the past.   Users/CovertProfessor
   AaronI am truly sorry for the tribulations you experienced with your parents. Mine are both elderly and in failing health so Im entering a hard time myself but CP really is spot on here. Noone is trying to chase you away at all. We really want you to be a productive contributor. Please consider whats been said here. Users/PeteB

And vise versa  Aaron


20130625 15:48:20 nbsp First edit with the other account was three years ago... Outside of http://daviswiki.org/APEX_Cycles_%26_Service?actiondiff&version2266&version1265 this which is technically sockpuppety but is of a much lesser degree (compared to examples like http://daviswiki.org/DOSiRAK?actiondiff&version215&version114 these with attacks on competitors)...  Pretty long con to attack a new used bike store when there are stronger competitors in town, and it didnt even seem like much of an attack. I feel like there was either a huge amount of malice that required serious longterm planning and slightly negative remarks to eventually ruin someones business (a plan that was ruined by not using a proxy) or maybe a person genuinely curious about another business who wanted to share his experience with another shop, but figured he would be burned alive if people found out he owned a bike shop. I can definitely understand why someone might want to review anonymously (business owners, professors, celebrities), and it might even be positive to the community if someone with a strong following (like a celebrity) would prefer their words be taken because of their previous contribution to the site rather than their status in the real world. If the anonymous account consistently provides good contributions, I dont think it would be a terrible idea if some people decided to have a separate anonymous account to review things. For example on a forum, if a popular moderator were to say something positive about something, youre most likely going to get a circlejerk just due to that moderators status, so if the moderator wanted his or her words taken seriously, posting on a regular account might be beneficial for the community.  Users/hankim
   To be clear: I dont object to him having a separate, anonymous account that he uses to comment on restaurants and such.  I object to him using it to say good things about his business and bad things about competitors businesses.  The fact that he didnt create the account in order to do that specifically, or that there are worse instances of sockpuppeting   both points I acknowledge  doesnt change the fact that what he did in those two instances was shady. I can understand the urge, but I still think its shady.   Users/CovertProfessor
     Definitely the first sockpuppetry act was shady (the one on his own business page) but I feel like the second one didnt seem malicious. I dont have an issue with a bike store owner reviewing other bike stores anonymously as long as he isnt lying about his experience there and he actually visited the shop. Users/hankim
      I see a reason but again IPs are logged and if he understood that in any way, then he had to know hed be discovered and questions would arise (again setting himself up). My only thought is he didnt realize his IPs were being logged? Users/PeteB
      I dont think it was malicious, no.  But he wrote things that cast the other place in a bad light.  In such a case, it matters that he has a financial stake.  cp
       A financial stake in taking out a new bike shop when there are larger and more established businesses in town? Users/hankim
        As Aaron himself said, Davis is a town that has more than a dozen competing businesses all vying for the same limited customer base.  cp
      That nails it perfectly CP...Users/PeteB
This isnt that big a deal. Id just suggest the problem go away: http://daviswiki.org/T%26M_Bike_Shop/Talk  Users/DonShor

What did I say specifically warrants that the comment should go away?  Aaron
 Youre a competitor, Aaron. Im not going to go over and critique another garden center. My critique wouldnt be the point. Its a conflict of interest.  Don

  I DIDNT CRITIQUE, I STATED THEY WERENT OPEN DURING POSTED HOURS (I WAITED 20 MINUTES BUT HAD TO LEAVE TO OPEN MY OWN SHOP) AND DESCRIBED WHAT I SAW IN THE STOREFRONT.  NOT ONCE DID I SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THEIR QUALITY OF WORK OR PRODUCT.  AARON

   Aaronone simple quote but 1st impressions not too great. That seems negative to me. As Daubert stated, Its not what you say but how you say it .  That could give someone a negative opinion of the bike shop right off the bat.  Thank you for updating your original post on the page for their shop.Users/PeteB

@Don, Are we not all friends and here for the benefit of the wiki? If I were looking at a garden center, Id want your opinion, because I respect it because I know that you know gardening.  Wether it be in a public forum or in private.  Who knows a field better than ones own?

@ Pete, So youre telling me if I were to say, 1st impressions not too great about any other business then itd be ok? But since I singled out the new business to which I had yet to formulate an opinion as a consumer or competitor and didnt have a great 1st impression I should have kept it to myself?

My opinion of them stands, its my opinion of Daviswiki that has changed.  Aaron

20130626 09:17:26 nbsp Dont forget places like http://daviswiki.org/The_Used_Phone_Store this and http://daviswiki.org/Bookstores these. People need to know what kind of phones they can purchase and all the publishers of products the bookstores might sell. Users/hankim

20130626 09:27:37 nbsp Heres a sequence of events that I see.  For years, you are considered a valued and productive member of the Davis Wiki.  Your business page is, in fact, a disaster.  Its promotional and bolded and over the top.  But I think everyone looked the other way because you were one of us.  Then you sockpuppeted against a defender.  Anyone can make a mistake, but in fact, youve defended your actions when someone as experienced with the wiki as you ought to know that what you did was wrong.  Now youre just retaliating by making a mess of the wiki.  Basically, your spending all the capital youve built over the years.  You no longer come across as a good guy, happy go lucky, etc.  You come across as petty.  You might want to rethink your actions.  They are not helping you or your business.  Some friendly advice. Users/CovertProfessor

 Ive moved pass the sockpuppet debacle, I took my licks like a man and fessed up to it.  I updated and took credit for my posts.  I am now and still talking about what should be allowed on a business page.  If they can do it, so can all other retailers.  Do some research on their business, get to work and start editing, fix my sloppy haphazard edits and make the Daviswiki the best it can be.  Aaron

  I look at it like this, if its good for the goose, its good for the gander.  Just because its assumed or implied does not make it so.  I will spend time toning APEXs page down to the specs of the other pages, but I will aso try and make an attempt at other retailers pages to list what brands they sell new and used since thats what your argument is in regards to my wanting to remove it from T&M.  Lets educate the public rather than allow one retailer to benefit from the wikis indifference and self righteous atitude towards me.  As many of you have stated in regards to yourselves, I will continue to fight the good fight but as I see fit. I expect you all to do no less.  Aaron

20130626 15:48:37 nbsp May be worth stepping back for a bit and letting things cool off. Everyones already fired up.  Users/jefftolentino

20130626 15:54:51 nbsp Not yetIve had some work issues come up (server moves) and Im now doing dbl shifts the rest of the week. I promise Ill look into it when I can but work comes first. Will probably be next week at this point.Users/PeteB

20130702 21:27:44 nbsp Aaronwhen you asked me to look into Cannondale, I thought to check out some of the authorized dealers you list on the APEX Cycles page. What is concerning is that a few of themBiria Bicycles, Lynskey Titanium Bikes and Von Dessel (I spoke to 2Von Dessel emailed me back) have stated you are NOT an authorized dealer for their bikes.

Im going to be around very sporadically for the next few weeks as my elderly mother is very ill at a local hospital, but I wanted you to have an opportunity at clarifying the issues with these 3 companies. Users/PeteB
  Im curious to hear your reply to PeteB, given how concerned you were about other shops potentially misrepresenting who they are authorized dealers for.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Due to your not responding I have removed Biria & Lynskey & Von Dessel from your authorized dealers list. Both of them said (Biria & Lynskey)on the phone to me(Von Dessel informed me by email) that you are not an authorized dealer. If you are going to express concerns about other bike shops it would be appropriate to make sure your own list of authorized dealers is updated. Users/PeteB

   Wow, take a break from the wiki to let things cool down and this is where you guys want to take it.  Not sure who you talked to at Biria USA and Lynskey, but according to Michael Biria @ BiriaUSA (2014611980) and Don Erwin, Sales Manager or Jack Kopeski, Sales Account Manager @ Lynskey Performance (423.499.5815) I I am still an authorized dealer and considered a non stocking dealer respectively.  As for Van Dessel, I was the only dealer in the area for a long time and did not think to ever renew my dealership agreement as I always just ordered when I needed one.  Im fine with the removal of Van Dessel, but I urge you to call the names above to confirm my status with Biria and Lynskey.  I await your all powerful verdicts.  Aaron (07/16/13)

20130716 17:25:30 nbsp Terrific! You followed up and corrected the issuegreat! Thats what we were suggesting. Users/PeteB

20130716 17:32:33 nbsp I restored Biria and Lynskey. I called the #s on the website and was given to people who I simply asked the question if you were an authorized dealer and was told no. Straight up question and I was put on hold while they researched it and said you werent an authorized dealer. shrug. Maybe they have a staff issue but I am not responsible if they gave me inaccurate info Users/PeteB

20130716 19:06:53 nbsp PB gave you lots of time (two weeks) to respond before editing the page for your business, and then when he did edit the page, merely deleted the claims that were, as best as he could tell, false.  That is far more courtesy than you extended to your competitors.  You keep trying to act the injured party here, but I am not buying it. Users/CovertProfessor

  You dont have to buy it, you have to accept it because DW is a MPOV wiki.  Im sure you were curious, based off of you back handed/snide remark back on 07/02. And I didnt need to extend that courtesy, because I new for a fact that my competitor had no place claiming something that was false.  Its because of the one sided battle with the popular editors that I stayed away from the wiki for a while, but we can get back into it if you wish.  Aaron

  You can consider it snide if you like.  But in fact, it was a second invitation (PBs was the first) for you to respond.  But do I have to accept that you are an innocent party here?  No, I dont have to.    cp
   And sure, we can get back into how you sockpuppeted and used that sockpuppet to criticize a competitor, then acted like a spoiled child.  But hey, none of that reflects well on you, so I would drop it.  Even better, admit that you behaved badly.  Look, all that was needed here was for you to set the record straight on which companies you are in fact authorized for.  But youve come back with an attitude, so now youre making yourself and everyone miserable.  Doesnt have to be that way, but thats the bed youve made.  cp

   Sure, and we can go on about how you as a popular editor can make all the snide comments you wish with no recourse.  The kettle calling the pot black as it were.  AC

20130716 19:43:19 nbsp I didnt make that remark about popular editors  PB did.  I dont know why you keep mixing me up in that. Users/CovertProfessor

  I never said you did. Im generalizing that you popular editors like to tag team and at times are just as unproductive as anyone else.  I admit that much of what I have said recently has no benefit to the wiki, its the fact that I cant stand the condescending attitude from you guys (another generalization).  Look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you can truly say youve never said or done anything in frustration/anger that you later regret.  I apologize, if I didnt make it clear that I did before (and will probably have to apologize for the rest of my time on DW) for my actions and hope to make it a better place for all.  But I will not stand by and let the opinions of a select few try directly or indirectly make me out to be the villain.  I was merely pointing out that whomever PB talked to was misinformed, but I did see it as a direct retaliation for my previous actions.  If it truly was just to be fair, why not do it for ALL the shops, not just mine. He can shrug all he wants, but thats how it looks and again, I know first hand how appearances play a factor on DW.  But of course you had to chime in as well.  Was it productive and in the benefit of DW, some might say yes, and some might say no, but it did come off as snarky.  Again, something that I was crucified for being.  But in regards to EZ smog, I was totally justified in my opinion that PB made a mistake in mentioning the popularity of an editor to justify her stand on the matter.  So no matter how childish I may sound at times there is relevance to that post.  But you nor PB were able to see that.  You popular editors (again a generalization), saw that it was me and started to jump down my throat.  It would appear I was not the only child on the playground that day.  Aaron

There are a bunch of issues mixed together here, so let me separate them out and respond one at a time.
  I am not a popular editor; I am a frequent editor who has pissed off every single one of the other frequent editors on more than one occasion.  We dont all walk in lockstep, agreeing on everything.
  I agree, not all of my edits are productive and I have done things in frustration and anger that I have regretted later, here on the wiki and elsewhere.
  Thank you for the apology.  Prior to this, you defended your actions and then said you wanted to move on.  I would find it hard to work with someone who felt that such actions were legitimate.  Now that you have apologized, I can move on and not bring up the subject again.
  It was fine for you to point out that whoever PB talked to was misinformed.  Thats why we waited two weeks for your response  to hear your side of things.
  I see PBs checking up on your business as an issue of consistency.  If someone is going to make a big stink about other businesses, as you did, then they should expect that they will be examined in the same fashion.  They are in effect saying that these are the standards that they wish to be held by and by which they hold others. I am sorry if you see that as retaliatory, but I dont.
  I agree with you that being popular has nothing to do with comments that stay on EZSmog, but I never said otherwise.  My comment on the talk page was directed at the topic of the page, not at you.  I dont know why you insist on thinking that it had something to do with you.  I only responded to you when it seemed that you were criticizing my claim that the comment should stay on the page.

20130716 20:35:20 nbsp Thank you for cleaning up the A1 Smog page, Aaron.  I hope you dont mind that Im staying out of this whole thing.  After having had to file a lawsuit after bullshit that grew out of wiki drama, I dont have much stomach for it.  Ill just note that I think everyone involved seems to be editing angry again, and it doesnt seem very constructive.  Calling your vendors did seem a bit retaliatory, and Im not a fan of that.  But I think todays discussion is only making things worse. Users/TomGarberson
    To answer TGs thoughtI called the vendors originally out of his concern that a competitor was inappropriately listing names of companies they were not authorized dealers for. If you are going to be concerned about the listings for other providers, I thought it reasonable to check for him too. Only after my research did I discover competitors page no longer has the listings but the work had already been done. In no way was it retaliatoryit was being fair. Users/PeteB
