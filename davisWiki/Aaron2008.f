20080614 00:02:06 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Aaron, and Welcome to the Wiki! My names Evan, pleased to meet you! Thanks for adding a comment to the Graduate Tutorial Services LLC... if you know anything about the organization and what they offer, I encourage you to edit the entry itself by clicking the Edit button  that entry, just like every other one on the wiki was written by people like you... and if you know the topic, youre the best person to write about it!

On a personal note, Im curious as to why a dozen people suddenly jumped all over one guys anecdote weeks after he posted it, several of them signing up (at least one appearing to come in from out of the state) just to yell at him. What prompted the public and ugly lynching? It certainly seems quite coordinated and planned. It also seems odd that everybody is simply leaving comments (even after the actual content was moved elsewhere) and nobody seems interested in adding to the entry... add comments are specifically attacking the single comment (even after it was moved). It seems very strange. I must admit in many years of watching the wiki, Ive never seen such a concerted attack upon a fellow neighbor simply relating their personal experience. What prompted the organized response? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
