20050915 11:17:35 nbsp Hi Aaron.  Basically there is no difference between the change I made and the one you put before.  This one just looks neater to people who are logged in.  To someone who is not logged in, your email will still look like aburda AT gmail DOT com. Users/CarlMcCabe

20050915 22:54:00 nbsp To get money from CFC, you have to become a registered club, which means that you are an authorized agent of the University of California Davis. There are a bunch of legal restrictions you have to go through (including opening a bank account for the club, although you can do this with CFC) and you need five officers who are legally responsible for the club. Its really a pain in the ass. Users/ArlenAbraham
