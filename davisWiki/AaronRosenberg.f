Aaron is a mathematics graduate student.  He has a http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~arosenberg website, and mailto:arosenberg@ucdavis.edu an email address.

Aaron adopted a pair of 5monthold kittens from the Orphan Kitten Project in August.  Asher (happy in Hebrew) is nearly twice as big as his sister, Tzviya (gazelle in Hebrew).  Tzviya loves chin rubs, chairs, kneading, watching Aaron cook, and watching anything moving on the computer screen.  Tzviya is slowly learning how to play fetch.  Asher loves belly rubs, playing soccer with any objects that will roll or slide, food, bathtubs, and sinks.  Asher is slowly learning that he cant get a belly rub while Aaron is sleeping...therefore he must wake Aaron up to get his 3am belly rub.  ...and 4am.  ...and 5am.  ...and 6am.  ...and 7am.  ...and 8am.

Tzviya and Asher have learned new tricks!  Tzviya is getting the hang of XfetchX play with ball and dont return it and sit.  Asher is becoming increasingly talented at chewing through cords of all shapes and forms from USB and speaker cables to highvoltage, highcurrent surgeprotector cables.  Apparently, kittens have 50% resistance to lightning damage, in addition to the XsixX four lives the mischievous little brat has remaining.

I also now have three baby corn snakes.  They are albino (aka, pink!) and heterozygous for blood corn, so they should have some blood corn babies when they grow up.  Pitriya doesnt like eating.

  Mathematical interests:
   topology
    knot theory
     Khovanov homology
      cobordisms: thingies that thing between things
       further abstract abstracted abstraction, as long as its pretty.
    Legendrian knot theory
  Nonmathematical interests:
   stuff
   shiny stuff
   tasty stuff
   Dune
   Truth and Beauty (not the quark varieties!)

  Favorite quote written in a paper or problem set so far: For w in S, note that w is never happy unless w has cookies.
  I am firmly convinced that all mathematical terms should be words like happy, perfectly normal, and quandle.
  Cobordism?!  Nah: thingy that things between things.

  I know me too!  er.  wait. nevermind, no I dont. Users/AaronRosenberg AR
   Thats sad. Ill help you with that sometime... Users/MichelleAccurso

20060804 16:51:01 nbsp i like your fractal art work.  for some reason i get an error when i try to access your senior thesis. Users/MattHh

  Im http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~arosenberg/papers/hcthesissemifinal.pdf still seeing an error.  Yeah, I want to read your thesis. :)  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Ill see if I can figure out whats going on sometime in the next week or two.  I swear I fixed it and saw it working on multiple computers a couple months ago... Users/AaronRosenberg AR

20070816 18:35:20 nbsp Its good to know that in a world that is corrupted by journalists, the Oxford comma still lives on! Users/WilliamLewis

20071112 16:19:50 nbsp Just curious what methods do you use to generate your fractal art. Is it paint, computers,...? Users/MattHh

   It says at the bottom of http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~arosenberg/fractal/fractal.html this page the computer programs hes used. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20071130 09:09:26 nbsp Your kitties are too cute!  Any advice on how you taught them to fetch? Users/FeralFeline

20071209 16:10:19 nbsp hello. do you know about the Wiki BBQ Jan 2008? Everyones invited. Were trying to spread the word, so if you want to let other people on the wiki know, go ahead and copy and past this. gracias!  Users/JessicaRockwell

20071210 07:56:32 nbsp Aaron  That sounds like a cool book on cats!  Boo and Taffeta are great cats and it is a shame that they havent gotten adopted yet.  Sometimes being at Petsmart in a cage with all the unfamiliar sounds and actions can be scary for the cats and their true greatness does not shine through. Users/FeralFeline
