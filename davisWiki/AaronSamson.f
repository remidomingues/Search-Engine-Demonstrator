20090705 19:20:19 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. So is it Taqueria Guadalajara The Guad or Taqueria Guadalajara Guads? Is it possible that in your circle it is called Guads, but known as The Guad by others? Users/JasonAller

20090707 17:48:28 nbsp Anyway, youre talking about changing something that goes back to the http://daviswiki.org/Taqueria_Guadalajara?actionrecall&version3 third revision of the page in 2004. Nobody has seemed to have a problem with it until early 2008. Yes, calling the place the guad is stupid, but my friends do it all the time. It pretty much is the default burrito joint that people in my social circle go to (although I much prefer Taqueria Davis). I personally prefer just guad, but whatever. Users/WilliamLewis

20090707 20:26:29 nbsp I am a current student, and Ive never heard it called Guads. Maybe we should only call it The Guad, then? Users/JoePomidor

20090707 23:56:06 nbsp The only true name is the one on their sign or their business license. All others are, as the page says, also known as and so there is no point in saying one is more correct, they are not the true name. Its like arguing if 2+2 equals 5 or 6. A different situation might be if The Guad or Guads used to be on the sign and they changed their name, but I havent seen any evidence of this. Users/NickSchmalenberger
