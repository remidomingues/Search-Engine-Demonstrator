20081007 16:02:29 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Aaron, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for your additions, but they are a bit thin on content, so some other editors deleted them.  As an example, you say you love Chipotle, but you dont say why.  For a review, thats fine, but for a new entry, you kind of need to have more than just a minor comment (or at least the people who deleted the entries probably thought so).  No worries, I just wanted to welcome you to the wiki and let you know what happened. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
