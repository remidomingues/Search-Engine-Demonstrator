20050319 12:37:54 nbsp Your story is a violation of your rights. They cannot pull over every car for no reason, they have to have some sort of reasonable suspicion. While they can ask for them, no one but the driver has to give his ID to the officer. And they can only ask you to exit the vehicle, for again, reasonable suspicion. Howevre as you have experienced, police will lie you ran a stop sign to get you to hand over your ID. However even if a cop lies, and you know it, it is smart not to argue as arguing should be saved for court. But yes, it is a civil rights violation. This is an example of the slipper slope civil rights are falling down in the name of fighting terrorism, eco and other. Users/JimSchwab
