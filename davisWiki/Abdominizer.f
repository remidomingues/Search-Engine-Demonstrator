Abdominizer was a groundbreaking prepostpunk acoustapowerfolkrock trio consisting of Steve Walter on 5string acoustaslide guitar and background vocals; Users/AdamFlowers Adam Flowers on electric and fiberglass bass, bamboo flute, nose flute, kazoo and lead vocals; and Lucas Taber on percussion, fartsicord, dog brush and background grunting.



Formation


Abdominizer was founded on May 17, 1991 at 3:39 PM PST.  Steve The Beave Walter had just found a guitar in his garage missing a string.  He proceeded to hit it with a whiffleball bat.  This gave him an idea.  After calling his friends Lucas Pukas Taber and Adam Garbled Answering Machine Message Flowers to his house, the band began its first and only recording session.  The resulting disasterpiece was the selftitled album of legend.


Abdominizer  The Album

Abdomizer  The Album was revolutionary in several ways, most notably for its use of the nose flute, fartsicord, dog brush and chopsticks.  The most memorable tracks on the record are Abdominizer  Uh Ah Uh Ah Ah Ah which is almost a straight lift of AC/DCs Thunderstruck,  China Pie which is not a copy of anything, and an inspired cover of the Everly Brothers Hit ByeBye Love most notable for a searing kazoo solo by Flowers.

Decline and Breakup


After numerous creative differences and Adam needing to go home and wash his hands for dinner, the band broke up on May 17, 1991 at 5:47 PM PST.
