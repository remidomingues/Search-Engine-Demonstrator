20050128 10:34:36 nbsp I went once for a late dinner, and it was one of the most terrible restaurant experiences Ive ever had.  The food, service and cleanliness of the place were all terrible.  I like diners, but this one wont get a repeat visit unless a bunch of people say that my experience was a fluke. Users/JabberWokky

20050128 11:30:13 nbsp Ive eaten at Abes half a dozen times or so, right after they first opened.  The food and service seemed adequate to me for a diner style place.  For a while I was in the habit of grabbing their breakfast special for takeout after working all night.  My experiences were decent, but not good enough to keep me coming back longterm.  I was also turned off when they made a big hassle about serving me alcohol on picnic day despite me having a valid CA ID.  I havent eaten there in at least a year. Users/JevanGray

20050128 14:15:23 nbsp I went there once for breakfast. It was like every other mediocre diner ive been to for breakfast. Not particularly bad, but too far away for somone w/o a car to make the trek out there. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050301 18:00:11 nbsp This location used to be Dennys.  The interesting thing about the restaurant is how amazingly huge it is.  They have decent specials, but you really should order food appropriate to the sophistocation of the restaruant.. otherwise prepare to be disappointed.  I recommend:  Burgers, sandwiches, ham & eggs.

20050422 14:02:06 nbsp Ive eaten a few breakfasts from here, and its all been pretty decent.  Think Dennys  edible, but generally not spectacular.  The big omelet thing they have with all the meat and vegetables is particularily tasty. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050717 15:44:04 nbsp I didnt know how badly a restaurant could ruin basic breakfast dishes until I ate here. Users/NoelBruening

20051006 18:26:45 nbsp wow.  I dont think theyre too bad.  I mean, I usually just get bacon eggs and toast.  There the possibility is only that something would be over or undercooked, and I dont think its ever been either for me.  Whatever did you order? Users/JaimeRaba

20060105 18:04:01 nbsp I have been to Abes twice, because it is so cheap and I had coupons.  Still, its not worth it.  The potatoes tasted like they were fried in really old grease.  Cindys is a better option for South Davis breakfast. Users/KalistaHickman

20060105 18:04:38 nbsp Abes is okay if youre going for something impossible to screw up.  Lets say... Turkey sandwich. Users/JaimeRaba

20060224 09:45:29 nbsp Abes went outof business a couple of weeks ago.  The signs are still up but the restaurant is empty. Users/SteveGreen

20060306 00:05:27 nbsp Miss old Abes. Apparently, a new place called The Rock Hard Cafe will be opening soon. Riiiiiiiight. Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20060306 13:15:55 nbsp Youve got to be kidding!  (I hope you are.)   You know what could be really successful in this location?  A seafood restaurant.  Because people are willing to actually drive for seafood.  Users/JaimeRaba
 Or a 24hr coffee place. Its close to the freeway, and people are willing to bike for 24hr coffee. Also, rock hard cafe? Am I the only one who thinks this is going to be some sort of homoerotic, masculine coffee shop somehow integrated into a gym?   Users/ArlenAbraham
    It used to be a Dennys, which I believe was 24 hours, and that apparently didnt work out well. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20060821 13:43:03 nbsp New owners did a total remodel and Abes reopened as Cafe Casablanca in May 2006.  It closed less than two months later.  Theres a notice posted on the front door from the Yolo County Public Health Department that says the ceiling and air conditioning system are full of mold and need to be replaced.  Users/SteveGreen

20090725 21:29:19 nbsp Abes has been vacant three years now.  The empty building is decaying and surrounded by a chain link fence.  I wonder what the scoop is?  It seems like a good location for SOME kind of restaurant. Users/SteveGreen
