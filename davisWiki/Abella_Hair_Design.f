20051023 23:22:36 nbsp Oh, I got the choppiest haircut of my life, and only an hour before my family was due at my apartment for dinner the day before my graduation.  My mom had to straighten it out for me.  Come on, all I wanted was straight in the back with layers around my face (my hair is long).  Its a basic style everyone else does just fine.  And $26 dollars didnt even buy me blowdry. Users/ReginaSikora

20060502 09:40:49 nbsp recommended by friend whos hair always looks great. First visit a few weeks ago, called Friday night, got appt for Saturday no problem.  Cut and color very satisfactory and price is reasonable.  Will definately return. Users/ElizabethDauch

20070626 21:14:14 nbsp Crappy haircut, couldnt style worth anything. Waste of money... Maybe I just got the wrong stylist, but dont believe them when u ask them if they can cut your hair a certain way, they always will say yes even though its way out of their league. Beware. Users/JonathanLee

20070722 08:24:29 nbsp The stylist, Soon, was able to fit me in on a Saturday afternoon with just over an hours notice.  She gave me the best haircut of my lifeand a brandnew style for mefor $25, and even showed me a couple different ways to style it.  Highly recommended! Users/LeslieMadsenBrooks

20070927 17:52:43 nbsp Soon was very nice, I did not have cash on me and she let me come back later with it Users/YooHyunOak

20080129 18:52:27 nbsp Soon (the woman who works at the chair closest to the window) consistently does great, affordable eyebrow waxing.  Ive also seen some really good haircuts getting finished up when I do a walkin appointment.  Since Ive mostly seen her haircuts for clients of Asian background, Id love to hear about anyones experience who has somewhat wavy or colicky (caucasian) hair like mine...

The other stylist I know nothing about, as they each operate their own business.  Something to keep in mind when reading reviews. Users/CatherineSD

20080211 18:15:37 nbsp Nooria from Afghanistan cut my hair.  I cant tell the difference between an okay haircut and a great haircut, I dont need any fancy styling, and maybe I have the wrong head for a really fabulous cut.  In any case nothing went wrong, I was satisfied, and Nooria seems more intelligent than some other barbers that have cut my hair.  She respected my schedule and she was good for a conversation. Users/GregKuperberg

20080711 14:49:03 nbsp Nooria is very talented at what she does. She is very well mannered and a real professional. She is very accomodating and fairly priced as well. Whereas, the other lady, named Soon, is not a very nice lady. I have witnessed on several occasions that she argues and tries to steal Noorias client including myself, which I find very unprofessional. I have also noticed that Soon keeps her station and other areas of the salon very dirty. Please be aware. Users/Kevin80

20080806 14:12:01 nbsp I got the best hair cut of my life from Nooria!  My sister finally convinced me to cut my long hair when I visited her in NC last June.  She took me to her stylist who spent two and a half hours and charged me a fortune.  I liked the style, and when I came back home I was worried I would be able to find someone to do as good a jobI found Nooria and I like it even better than the first time!  Everywhere Ive gone the last few days, I have gotten compliments on my haireven from complete strangers! Users/Debi

20080920 21:41:29 nbsp I recenly got a hair cut, color correction and highlights from Nooria and absolutely loved her work. I have gotten the best haircut and a very pretty highlight. She did a great job correcting my hair color. She was also able to fit me in her schedule at the last minute.  Users/EmmaW

20081008 21:04:46 nbsp Nooria did an excellent job cutting my hair. She cut it exactly the way I wanted and even straightened it after blow drying all for a VERY good price. I would have to say she gave me the best haircut I have ever had. I would highly recommend getting a haircut from Nooria.  Users/Simrun

20081111 20:57:34 nbsp
I dont know much about Abella, but weve followed Soon for years. Soons chair is the one closest to the window. She has done our whole family from straight to curly hair, including the extremely picky teenagers. Shes done all our cuts, waxing, piercing, etc.  for many years. Weve followed Soon and never strayed; there is no reason to. She is excellent, reasonably priced and a sweet gal. Besides, its kindve fun to say that I need Soon soon.  Users/bhdjtd

20081119 23:22:11 nbsp Ive been to Nooria for my eye brow waxing since I moved to West Davis a year ago. She is the best, she does waxing and threading and always does a consistently awesome job. Not once has she screwed up on a job for me and she definitely cares about her customers, she will always greet you with a smile and remember your name.  Users/LizBurciaga

20081130 14:58:47 nbsp i went to soon at abella to get a japanese hair straighening, cut and eyebrow wax last week. First of all, i hated my unmanageable wavy and poofy hair, especially during this time of the year, but after soon straignted my hair, i dont have to really do anything after the shower and its made my life so much easier! And the cut, she always does great job cutting my hair EXACTLY how i want it. I recommend her to college students because all her services are resonably priced. I also recommend calling to make an appointment the day before because sometimes hes very busy. She also takes walkins but dont confuse Soon with the other lady, Nooria.  Users/rachelH

20081205 21:58:07 nbsp i paid $160.00 at some fancy highend hair boutique to get highlights and low lights for my hair. well let me say it wasnt worth it!! they made the blond streaks too thick you couldnt even see the low lights.... so on my visit home for thanksgiving, my old time friend recommended Soon, i immediately took the advice. Soon was very professional yet caring and fixed my hair to how i wanted in the first place!! it was a miracle, cause i didnt think there was much i could do to my awkwardly colored hair. But ever since Soon fixed my hair AND gave me a little trim, FOR FREE!! (what a sweet lady!), i have actually been getting COMPLIMENTS!! THANK YOU SOON! I am 100% definately going back to her and leaving my fancy boutique here in L.A.  Users/s0602

20081221 17:37:08 nbsp Soon has a beautiful new website!! its easy.... www.abellahairdesign.com go check it out Users/rachelH

20090115 17:25:25 nbsp Go see Nooria! She is hands down amazing at what she does. To top it off, she is great to talk to and is one of those people that you feel lucky to know. I walked in there in desperate need of color correction, highlights and a cut, and I left with the best hair of my life. You get exactly what you want without paying the inflated prices you see downtown. On the other hand, Ive seen enough and heard enough from Soon to know that she is very shady, so make sure you get Nooria if calling for the first time. Users/MichellePalmer

20090118 20:59:30 nbsp I love Soon!  I have been going to her for ever, and I have followed her all over Davis.  She is great about getting you in at the last minute, and has very resonable prices.   Users/kmitchell

20090119 10:04:39 nbsp Got the BEST color and cut of my life from Nooria after moving here last year.  I will definitely go back.  Reasonable prices.  Not the most expensive or the cheapest, but worth every cent.  Holeinthewall environment  great cuts!  Who is Susan? Users/teamsutton

20090119 13:26:21 nbsp Soon has begun advertising herself as either Soon or Susan, which is no big deal until you consider the fact that prior to Nooria, the salon was occupied by Soon and a woman named Susie... who later died of cancer. Nooria stepped into Susies spot, and was to continue services for Susies clientele. Coincidentally, Soons new pseudonym creates confusion when people call looking for Susie... and she takes advantage of it by making the appointments for herself.  Users/MichellePalmer

20090121 12:07:31 nbsp well in response to the latest comment about Soon using Susan... her English name is SUSAN...  After she became a U.S citizen she changed her legal name to Susan Lee but many of her clients who has been following her for years know her as Soon. Plus, susie, nooria and soon(Susan) all have different phone numbers so i dont know how people would call Abella Hair design, Hair by Soon or Susan looking for Susie.. because Susan is a COMPLETELY different from Susie... I find it very disrespectful and distasteful when people make assumptions about a very nice person without knowing the facts. So meet or make an appointment with Soon and see for YOURSELF if you think there is even a TINY possibility that Soon (Susan) could be shady. Users/rachelH

20090121 12:09:02 nbsp one more thing, go on Soons website (www.abellahairdesign.com) for internet specials... there is a coupon you can print to get discounts! Users/rachelH

20090121 12:56:00 nbsp A quick check on the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology website reveals no record of a Susan Lee in Yolo county. Considering her legal name change... she may want to get that updated. I think the previous comments over the years speak for themselves, on both accounts: Soon (or susan, or rachel, or... ?) probably does great hair and is nice to her customers  but her business practices? Not so much.  Users/MichellePalmer

20090124 18:53:09 nbsp wow... Michelle (or Nooria??), you actually went on their website, this must really be important to you.... well Soons been doing hair for a long time and ever think that she got her license before she became a citizen? and it sounds like you know a lot about her business practices... interesting... well let me tell you, Soon does great hair and if shes nice to customers... i dont see why i should take her business practices into consideration even if it were true. So i guess as a honest customer michelle, you must look into EVERY companys business practices before using their services? you must have hard time finding any services anywhere... well besides my point, i came here to say that i went to Soon couple days ago and i got highlights and low lights and of course i am very satisfied... but i dont know when Wiki started to become such a nasty place... Users/s0602

20090124 22:41:02 nbsp Hahaha Michelle now ur saying Im Soon??? Funny... U have a lot of assumptions and accusations. It seems like Nooria is the one with the bad business ethics, she is the one advertising using susies name on her website... So whats up with that?? And how would u know so much about her business ethics?? U r starting to sound shady yourself only leaving bad comments about Soon...Anyways people, if u r reading this,
 Soon is a honest n hardworking lady, dont let these peoples comments deprive u of a chance of finding a right stylist for yourself, I took a chance n Im glad I did Users/rachelH

20090125 01:17:08 nbsp I am not going to argue with two anonymous accounts that have only ever contributed to this page when there is a history of someone creating accounts for the sole purpose of inflating reviews for Soon  check the talk page. Users/MichellePalmer

20090125 18:56:36 nbsp I went to Abella yesterday for a haircut and some coloring since my greys have been bothering me. The Asian lady, Soon, gave me a great cut and great color! She took some time to actually evaluate my hair texture and stuff for a tailored grey coverage. She really knew what she was doing and was very friendly. She didnt seem like a shady person as some of these reviews say she is. I highly recommend her. Users/JohnCA

20090201 17:58:09 nbsp I went to get a haircut with Nooria after my friend recommended her. I am really happy with it, especially for the great price. Nooria listened to what I wanted and got it exactly right. She was very nice and we had a great conversation.

As for the backandforth comments about Soons business practices that have gotten way out of hand here, Soon seemed nice and perfectly professional, as, of course, did Nooria. Users/Ratatat

20090303 14:03:26 nbsp Ive been going to Soon for haircuts for probably... 56 years, starting when she was at Pure Beauty in North Davis.  I know shes had business disagreements with others... so I suspect there might be sour grapes here from some.  Bottom line, shes friendly, reliable, and always given me great haircuts.  Users/ChonT

20090611 12:49:25 nbsp Ive been going to Soon for as long as Ive been going to school in Davis.
I have never seen any shady practice from Soon, and I highly question the negative comments that appear to be purposely and falsely written to defame her.
Soons is one of the nicest person Ive met in Davis.  She cares about her clients.  And  I really dont think she deserves to be insulted like this.



 Users/LF

20090615 12:59:49 nbsp I have been a customer of Soons for years and have recommended her to all of my students both male and female. She is kind, conscientious, and hard working who also gives great service.It really seems a little odd that Ms Palmer would try to discredit such a wonderful, honest person like Soon.  I have been a professor at UC Davis for 23 years and have followed Soon to all of her locations. My advice, dont listen to idle gossip. Just go in and meet Soon and you will know right away that she is a classy, friendly, competent hair stylist. Users/JackN

20090904 17:17:07 nbsp Very happy with my experience w/ Nooria.  I have long, thick and unruly asian hair and came in wanting a Japanese kawaii style cut.  Nooria took a brief look at the pictures I brought, knew exactly what I wanted and gave me the best haircut Ive had in a very long time.  She took her time styling it, and even gave me tips on how to recreate it at home.  All in all, a fine stylist for a very reasonable price! Users/Tammy

20091113 17:12:02 nbsp I have had a rather bad experience with hair cuts, as my hair is fine and I tend to keep it short.  Usually Id go to Super Cuts or some such and come out with something like a mullet  not ok, especially because I am female.  But when I went to Soon, I was really impressed with her attention to detail.  It is a very friendly atmosphere and for once I walked away with a haircut that I love!  She will soon be taking over the area next door to her as well, and therefore will have a larger place.  It is a very social atmosphere  which I mention because my boyfriend wasnt for it.  But I had great results and intend to return for every hair cut I get in Davis, and possibly some color in the future! Users/ReeseLayton
