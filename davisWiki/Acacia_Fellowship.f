Authority of Gods word and the importance living out and being transformed by Gods word.

Inclusiveness and diversity  We value a Christcentered, spiritled community that welcomes people regardless of cultural, ethnic, or racial background.
Accountability and availability  we believe that Christ called us to be devoted and committed to one another, upholding each other.


Small Groups

We have two small groups that meet during the week to study the word, spend time praying for each other, and breaking bread together  aka eating!!  Our purpose for each small group is to provide a place for people to share with each other their walk with God.  Through this, we learn to support, encourage and challenge each other in striving to grow more like our Saviour.
