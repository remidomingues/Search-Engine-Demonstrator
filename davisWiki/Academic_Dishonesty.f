There were 196 plagiarism cases referred to the disciplinary office in the 2009 academic year, according to an August 1, 2010 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/education/02cheat.html?srcme&refgeneral article published in The New York Times. Donald J.

The wife assured Mr. Dudley that it would not happen again, according to The New York Times.
