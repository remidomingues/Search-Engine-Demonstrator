At UC Davis, the Academic Federation is the body politic of nontenured faculty, i.e. the lecturers.  Unlike the Academic Senate, http://academicfederation.ucdavis.edu Academic Federation has virtually no power.  They primarily serve as the union for all of the instructors and researchers who arent professors, but they generally face difficulty in negotiating with the UC Davis University because professors teach so many classes at UCD.  Also, they have positions on many Academic Senate committees.
