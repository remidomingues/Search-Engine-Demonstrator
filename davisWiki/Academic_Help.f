 Getting Out 
  If your major is too hard, or not to your liking, consider changing your major.
  Taking some easy classes to boost your GPA may be good. Which classes?
  Retaking classes you did poorly in would instantly raise your GPA.  You may do this for up to 16 units worth of classes (approx. 4 classes) and only in classes where your grade was D or F (you cant replace grades of C or above).

 Getting to Graduate School 

  Take courses for a lettergrade instead of pass/fail when possible.
  Familiarize yourself with the GRE. You can register for it at http://www.ets.org the ETS.org website, but do not take the exam until you know more about it! Taking the SAT more than once was okay, but you want to avoid taking the GRE more than once.
  Kaplan Educational Center Kaplan occasionally hosts free GRE practice tests in the hopes of getting students to sign up for their prep courses. Take the practice test and see how you do.
  People to ask for information: your major advisors, your college advisors, the Career and Graduate Study Resource Center, your professors, and graduate students themselves. Also see Advising Services.
  Ask a question on the Q & A for Prospective Academics page
