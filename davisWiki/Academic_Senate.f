The http://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/ Academic Senate works behind the scenes to most students, but their actions greatly affect student life.  Academic Senate consists of all tenured and tenuretrack faculty at UC Davis; they are a division of the UC systemwide Academic Senate.

In contrast, lecturers and parttime faculty are members of the http://academicfederation.ucdavis.edu/ Academic Federation. The student government has a similarly named body called the ASUCD Senate.

They have an amazingly complex set of http://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/cerj/manual/dd_bylaws.cfm bylaws, which even includes a Committee on Committees.  If you want to know why some University academic policy is the way it is, most likely that policy will trace back to Academic Senate.  They also control undergraduate scholarships to a large degree.

In addition, Academic Senate essentially controls the direction that curricula and departments will take on a Universitywide level.  When a professor wants to teach a new course, the proposal must pass through the Senates Courses Committee, which then determines what appears in the catalog.  They also periodically review entire departments, and see if it meets the Universitys goals.  Of course, this is faculty reviewing itself, so changes at this level are far less drastic than at the UCD Administrative Officers Administration level. They also award the Distinguished Teaching Award.

Academic Senate also serves as the union for all tenured and tenuretrack faculty, and it has a lot of power in negotiation with the UCD Administrative Officers.  However, their opinions are not always heeded  67.2% of faculty http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id6772 voted against Move to Division I Moving to Division IAA Athletics.  Senate http://www.physics.ucdavis.edu/kiskis/ug_council/d1.html was not happy about this.

Undergraduate representatives are appointed through ASUCD University Affairs.
