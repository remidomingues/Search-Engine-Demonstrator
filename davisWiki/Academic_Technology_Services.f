Academic Technology Services is a unit of Information and Educational Technology. The unit was formed circa 2007 from the merger between Classroom Technology Services and Mediaworks.  It was an equal merger, meaning that neither department was taking the other over. The naming can be a bit confusing, because the name Mediaworks has been reused for one of the groups within ATS.

Most of the offices for ATS are located in Surge II.  The door on the west side of the building (facing Surge III) is the main entrance, providing customer service and reception for all of ATS offered services.  Some additional offices, primarily for UC Davis Computer Labs Computer Lab Management, are in the front part of Surge IV.

Following the merger, the unit was in a continuous state of reorganization for some time. The ATS groups seem to have settled for the moment into:

 Academic Applications & Support  These are the people who work on things like Smartsite and other campus applications. The quality assurance people then test all this software on every operating system configuration they can think of. They then provide faculty support on everything from MyUCDavis to PowerPoint to Personal Response Systems (AKA clickers).
 Client Services & Support  These are the people who handle clients and billing.
 Special Programs  One current special program is Faculty Mentoring Faculty... basically its trying to teach professors to use Smartsite.
 I.T. Support  They provide internal computer support to the department.
 Learning Spaces  This is one of the biggest groups in ATS. It includes the Classroom Technology Team, which installs and maintains the audiovisual systems in classrooms and departmental rooms, and UC Davis Computer Labs Computer Lab Management, which operates many of the campus computer labs.
 ATS Mediaworks Mediaworks  The other big group in ATS. They handle mediarelated things, such as photography, video, animation, and audiovisual equipment rental.
 Programming  They program things for the department, such as ESP, the departments proprietary inventory software in addition to providing programming assistance to other campus departments.
