The phrase Academic Year most widely refers to the calendar followed by UC Davis for the undergraduates (quarter system). It can also refer to the schedules followed by the School of Law (semester system) or the Davis Joint Unified School District (earlier start than UC Davis).



The UCD Registrar keeps the online http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/html/academic_calendar.html Academic Calendar.
