20130319 22:21:08 nbsp My partner and I have lived at Academy Lane Apartments (previously Americana Arms) for approx. 7 months now, and we couldnt be happier. The buildings are very clean and offer a good amount of space for the two of us (although a bit small, it works well as we dont have to worry about extensive furnishing). They did quite a bit of remodeling both inside the units and out in the hall, and it looks much  nicer than other apartment buildings Ive seen. Its about a 7 minute bike ride to campus even closer to Nugget, the Coop and the city library. The rent includes internet and cable. Although I have read previous complaints about the internet, I have experienced close to none. We REALLY like this place and have no plans on moving anytime soon. The only thing we are not so keen on is the squeaky nature of the flooring (its an old building). We have a different schedule from our downstairs neighbor, which has resulted in her being inconvenienced sometimes when we walk around later at night. (Although there are thin walls and squeaky floors, most people living here seem to be single grad students, so its pretty quiet!) Overall, I would definitely recommend this place as close to perfect as I have seen. Users/ElissaPerez

20130627 17:17:51 nbsp I just moved in at Academy Lane in May 2013 and I have never been more impressed with an onsite management team in my life! Angelique, Jason and Heather are amazing! Arnold, a member of the maintenance crew, is incredible as well. They address any need I have within 24 hours and are always polite, funny and easy to get along with. They are extremely professional as well. The apartments, while dated, (they were built in in the 1940s I think), have a certain amount of character but they have gone to great lengths to update each one with new flooring, windows (with screens!), appliances if needed, etc.
When I had a noise issue living downstairs and mentioned it to Angelique, she immediately suggested other apartment options I could move into and I am happy with the second floor option I chose.
Full disclosure: if you live near the train tracks on H Street like I do,  it can get noisy early in the morning, but Ive found if I just close my window I dont notice it anymore! No problem. And I am a light sleeper!  The grounds are stunning and well kept up, the pool is amazing, laundry room has HE washers and dryers. Plus they use these cards which are a lot easier than coins!! I havent noticed any problems with the free internet either and the FREE cable is amazing! And its not just basic channels, its the good ones like Animal Planet, HG TV, etc in addition to all the regular ones. Amazing!
More than anything though, I am impressed with how much the management team listens to tenant concerns and actually cares and understands (since they live onsite too). And the speed in which repairs are done is extraordinary!! I am so impressed and would recommend anyone live here at Academy Lane! Users/AlisonTaplin

20130628 11:56:10 nbsp I have been living here since June 2010. This is a nice, quiet, affordable, smoke free, close to campus, one bedroom apartment apartment complex. It used to be quite competitive in price but this year the price went up and now it is comparable to other onebedroom apartments in Davis. It is very close to Yolo and Unitrans bus lines and just 12 min bike distance from campus. It has a nice pool (the new management maintains it way better than the old one), a berbeque place ( Although never used it), huge parking area, and nice international environment (lot of your neighbor are international students and scholars). One problem is the wooden floor which is anything but soundproof, so either buy an areacarpet if you live upstairs or pray for a nice neighbor if you decide to live downstairs (lived more than two years downstairs and never had any problem with neighbors except one). Overall, this is a nice place if you prefer to live close to campus. Users/saikatdutta

20130823 20:33:39 nbsp I have lived in these apartments since 2011, and I have been very happy here. The old management was super awesome, and I was worried when the new management came in, but they have been pretty great so far. Theyve done a LOT of renovation of the property. I know that theyve added woodstyle vinyl flooring, but my apartment is still carpeted, and I imagine my neighbors below me are pretty grateful for thatyou should get an area rug, at least, if you have a secondfloor apartment, and earn the goodwill of your downstairs neighbors. The property is very quiet, except for the irritating leafblowers that come throughout the weekthough this is a Davis thing, Ive found, and cant really be avoided. In three years, Ive never had to deal with a loud neighbor. I like being on the courtyard side of the property; I would worry about the noise if I was on the pool side, and there is a gorgeous tree outside my window that fills my view, and even turns a beautiful red in the autumn. The management can take a little too long to respond sometimestheyre always fixing something around here, and it seems like theyre spread a little thin. It isnt a serious problem, though. Theyre currently installing weatherproofing around the apartment doors, which will help with tenants energy costs. I have been very grateful for the safety of the building (the locked outside doors, the indoor entry to the apartment, the welllit parking lot). I also never, ever see bugs in my apartment. I know this is a problem at other apartment complexes butat least being upstairsI think Ive had a couple spiders and a fly once, but thats it. The complementary internet and cable is fantastic. The rent used to be great, but its gone way up while Ive been here (by $160/monthwhich is a lot). The only reason Ill leave here is if they price me out; theyre right at the limit of my budget now. Hopefully it will stabilize and Ill be able to stay for a few more years. Users/mjsparl

20130831 22:11:53 nbsp Although the complex is old, the renovations have made the rooms much nicer with fake wood floors and new carpet. Most of the residents are quiet grad students which is nice. The rent is ok given how small the rooms are but management is very helpful and nice. Heating and cooling are a problem given the old equipment. Overall a good apartment that I will continue to rent from.  Users/alexsalo

20130926 21:45:52 nbsp I have lived at Academy Lane Apartments for 3 years now and have had an enjoyable experience. I chose these apartments because I was drawn to the quiet and wellmaintained property. When I first moved in the complex was under different management and it has been about a year now since new owners took over the property. I am very impressed with their improvements to the interior and exterior of the complex. They have also encouraged a community atmosphere for the residents through social events, which really shows they care about the wellbeing and happiness of their residents. I really like the office and maintenance staff, they are polite and always helpful. All of my maintenance requests have been completed promptly . The apartments themselves are cozy and wellkept. Most of the residents here are polite and quiet. There are quite a few families in the complex which I like and the younger college students are more respectful compared to the places I have lived at before.  I would recommend the Academy Lane Apartments to anyone looking for a quiet and laidback place to live.  Users/cd1124fstreet

20140304 15:02:08 nbsp I moved to Davis from New York City in April 2013.  I was having trouble finding an apartment at that time of year and was fortunate to drive by Academy Lane and see the sign that they had a vacancy.  I am an older person who has lived in apartments all of his adult life, so I know  a wellrun place when I see it.  The people managing this complex are caring, industrious and friendly. They keep the entire facility in absolutely top condition, including the really nice patios by the pool under big oak trees, which grace the whole property with very welcome summer shade.  When I have had any sort of minor problem, such as a slowrunning faucet, the excellent maintenance person is at the door very quickly.  And when I had a problem of some distracting noise from upstairs, they did some serious work tightening the floor boards and I have heard nothing for months.  I happen to live right down the hall from the office so I have actually gotten to know all of the folks who run the place, and I have enjoyed being around them.  They go out of their way to make  the students from all over the world, who are the majority of the tenants, feel at home.  A UC Davis campus bus and the Sacramento bus stop right in front of the building, and it is a very pleasant and easy walk to the business district through beautiful historic old Davis. I am returning to New York in April and will always remember Academy Lane as a place that really enhanced my experience of living in Davis.

20140325 07:30:21 nbsp Overall great place to live. The apartments are walking distance to downtown, yet far enough away where you can have a quite night outside. The grounds are well maintained, with a pool (open 24 hr), large grassy areas and brick BBQ grills. Ample street parking for guests and on a major bus line. The staff are extremely nice (eg deliever packages to your apartment) and maintenance is clean and responsive (usually same day response). Major appliances are brand new (including new cardbased laundry facilities), water pressure is OK, however minor things are not well built (eg straight door frames, level floor in some spots).  I would hihgly recommend this place.    Users/alexpevzn

20140412 09:57:11 nbsp We have lived here short term. We need to move because of our job. The appartment was quiet and has nice court yard. Maintence guys are always  helpful and quick. We are sad to leave here. Thank you Academy Lane!! Users/Kosukesatoh

20140503 13:13:35 nbsp Ive lived here for about 7 months now and am generally very satisfied. The office and property staff are very responsive. Most inapartment repair requests are handled promptly. I also really appreciate that there is an after hours number you can call to reach the resident property manager when there are any problems. Ive seen the property manager check out a situation at 2 in the morning due to noise complaints. Unfortunately, the cost of living here is pretty high when living off of a graduate student stipend, but its been worth it for me because of its been a good environment to be productive and relax as well.  Users/JTa

20140530 14:55:53 nbsp I have lived at Academy lane for 9 months now, and I am very satisfied with the living experience. As a UCD student, I want a laidback and quiet apartment where I can come home and unwind: it is exactly what I get from this apartment complex. The management is very nice and responsive with questions. I live in a scholar street view apartment, and I like how much light the windows let in. It keeps the apartment from feeling boxy. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants a quiet, enjoyable, and relaxing apartment complex. Users/CourtneyKohler

20140530 21:13:29 nbsp I have lived in Academy lane for a year now and I love it. I just renewed my lease for next year  and I am so happy. i highly recommend it. Users/Sandramosquera

20140609 11:02:02 nbsp This is a quiet and clean place to live. The office and maintenance staff are very responsive and professional. The grounds are kept nice and clean and really make the area feel like home. Most of the residents are quiet and courteous, making it a nice and relaxing place to live. The prices are not too bad either.  Users/cd1124fstreet

20140609 11:40:21 nbsp I moved to Academy Lane in September 2013 and I think its great. The staff is friendly, the maintenance team is responsive, and the grounds are well taken care of. Also, the E Line stops right outside the building, which makes getting to the UC Davis campus really easy. Even though its an old building, it adds character to the apartment and it really is nice. The walls are a bit thin, but the neighbors Ive had have been courteous. There are some noises that cant be helped, like walking and closing cabinets. It honestly doesnt bother me too much. For the price, its hard to beat Academy Lane especially when cable and internet are included in the rent. Its not just basic cable either. I was worried about not being able to watch BBC America, specifically, but the channel is included in the cable package. I have had some problems with the internet. It was down the entire Picnic Day weekend, but that wasnt Academy Lanes fault. It was Instaconnect.

All and all I would recommend Academy Lane Apartments. With a great staff and responsive maintenance, it really is a great place to live. Users/KrisP

20140630 19:28:19 nbsp Lived here for the past year and have reupped for another. Honestly, I was kind of worried about being right by the train tracks (also my unit is right by the tracks) but its not nearly as noticeable as you might think. Half the time I dont even hear it and its never woken me up which I guess is the most important thing. More importantly, having laundry right on the property is super useful and the AC works great.

The biggest thing for me, though, is the property management. I deal a lot with Melissa and shes absolutely fantastic. When it came time to reup, her constantly going way out of her way to be helpful is a big reason why I decided to stay.

In any case, Id definitely recommend this place.
