NOTE:  As of July 2010, it appears likely that Acadian has changed names to Ally Property Management, Inc..



NOTORIOUSLY THE WORST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN DAVIS

Acadian is one of a few major property management companies in Davis.  They manage an assortment of smaller properties in Davis, such as duplexes, small apartment complexes, and single family dwellings  a list is provided on their http://www.acadianmanagement.com/ website. Security deposits are typically 125% of one month rent, and if you have pets, security deposits will be at least 150% of one month rent. Unless otherwise stated, city utilities are not included in the rents. Application fee is $25 per person and must be paid by money order or cashiers check. Rates are from their website as of July 2008, but are posted as subject to change

Local properties managed by Acadian Properties include:
  Oakshade Commons Apartments
  Fifth Avenue Place

For a listing of other property managers handling accounts in the Davis area, please visit our Property Management page. Additionally, our Housing Guide can provide helpful information about your landlordtenant relationship.

Note to potential Acadian renters: Acadian is a management company, meaning not all of the properties they rent are owned by them.  The actual owner of each individual property arranges what they will and wont pay for when they agree to have Acadian manage their property.  As some have discovered, this can lead to unexpected difficulties when renting an Acadian managed property because the property owner wont pay for some problems to be fixed.  Even though they only manage the properties, they are still responsible for making the place livable, and can always be held to the contract they make for repairs. Though given the language their lease, you may be lucky to enforce anything.

Additionally, Acadian Properties DOES NOT use the Davis Model Lease, which most other companies in Davis use and offers better protection to tenants.

There was a California Aggie article about them in 2001 which talked about how bad they were.  A story run in 2008 (link currently broken) showed that not much had changed.

For problems with or questions about your status as a renter, check out your renters rights.

 Users/StevenDaubert reports that Acadian will tell property owners who they want or do not want in units (update: Acadians website drops this gem You are the BOSS and we work for you and your property!). Oh and they employ a couple of female Davisites of the 03 class variety

Given the comments and reviews listed here (many from well known Davis Wiki Editors), any potential renter should keep a few things in mind:
  Always get every promise by them in writing, and keep a copy of anything you send them or sent from them.
  Take dated photographs of the residence when you move in, even if they promised to fix something. Report any and all damages, when you move in on the movein inspection forms.
  Read your rental contract carefully, make sure you agree with everything listed and that all ambiguity is clarified.
   Check to see what they are supposed to repair given the contract.
   Of course, keep a copy of this contract, too.
  If they violate lease terms, take this up with them immediately, report them to the authorities, make as much noise as possible.
  If they do not own the property, find out who the owner is, and hound them as well.
  If you are a student, remember that you get free time from a lawyer from Graduate Student Association GSA or ASUCD, which you may wish to use in dealing with this company.
  Ask questions, hound them, you are paying them for their services, complain in writing, in person, and by phone.
  If the property is unlivable, or your complaints go unaddressed you are likely able, and should simply http://www.caltenantlaw.com/breaklease.htm break your lease.

I would like to ask anyone from Acadian properties to address the complaints here, and anyone who wishes to complain to refrain from personal attacks against the owners. I wish that this be a positive communication to resolve differences.

 Media Coverage 

A website has been launched by UCD Students to gather all complaints in one place and launch a classaction lawsuit. The problem with posting complaints on DavisWiki that it is practically impossible to contact the message owner due to limited profile information wiki provides. The website http://www.AcadianSucks.com has been eliminated.

  The California Aggie February 2008 http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2008/02/01/CampusNews/Students.Frustrated.With.Acadian.Management.Group3182293.shtml article about renters experiences.

 Community Involvement 


In 2009 they sponsored a car at the Dixon May Fair demolition derby: car number 65, Stay Alive.

20090128 22:35:47 nbsp Mixed.  Havent had many of the bad experiences because Im persistant when asking for help and have always recieved what was critical.  They did tell me that the owner didnt care about reparing things that left unchecked, will devalue his property over time.  But who knows.  Not my problem.  They are a pain in the ass and really drag their feet about things. All things considered, Id never use them again and would warn anyone I liked away from them. Users/Xon

20090217 I still hate this rental company as I had posted at an earlier date. However, I will have to admit that most of the time they were quick about maintenance requests  with the exception of the large tree limb that fell on roof and was there for a couple months. On the other hand, they had several violations going on in the house that were never repaired  stove that didnt work very well, fridge that didnt close properly, outlets that plugs wouldnt stay plugged into. Anyway, some issues. When we moved out we expected to have to fight for our deposit when they charged us for painting, cleaning (which we had left the house spotless), and hauling (the neighbors stuff that was on their side of the duplex but whatever). However, they somehow missed the charge that they had quoted in our walk through where my roommate had accidently burned the carpet while embrossing her wedding invitations  the one exception where we did actually cause damage rather than make the house nicer (we planted flowers, replaced the gate, and so on). So we decided it was pretty even. I still hate them and it wasnt worth the headache to rent from them, but we did at least get a fair amount of our deposit back and most of the major maintenance issues they were quick about. Just to be fair.

20090228 01:10:20 nbsp Just like a few other people in Davis, I was also threatened to have the cops called on me (mepetite).  In their powertrip world, nobody has the right to talk back or question them.  I went on their website and they said theyve been here for 30 years???  WTF?  Youve got to be joking.  Please tell me that the current people werent in the business for this long.  Like Lola said, I am for small family business, but they are really rude, unprofessional, powertripping assholes.  Lesson learned the hard way. Users/geezlouisexyz

20090317 17:25:15 nbsp They are such assholes.  I was supposed to view an apartment today and after waiting for an hour I mistakenly decided to go to the office to talk to them.  I calmly stated that I had taken the afternoon off work to see the house and that I was upset at how unprofessional it was that they never called me to say no one was coming.  The managers response was Ill remember your face so I can never rent to you.  I have already filed a complaint with the chamber of commerce and will be reporting them to the better business bureau.  Everyone should do the same!!! Users/evilforestgnome

20090408 13:48:56 nbsp STAY AWAY FROM ACADIAN PROPERTIES. I have rented from them for the past year and can honestly say that Ive never had a positive experience in dealing with them. The receptionist at the front of the office is particularly rude when dealing with people that come in, and the managers treat you like an idiot when you have questions. They rely on the assumption that you, as a tenant, do not know the explicit language of your lease and will take advantage of you if youre not careful. I once visited the office to request a copy of my lease, so that I could verify whether or not the agreement included certain terms. The workers at Acadian were overtly irritated that I would not simply take their word on the language of the lease, and the simple act of requesting a copy of a lease turned into a very unnerving and frustrating ordeal. My renting experience with Acadian has been overwhelmingly negative and I would highly advise against entering into business with this company. Users/Dmaroon

20090512 14:16:25 nbsp Up until now my interactions with Acadian has been minimal. Last night however, my garage door came off the tracks and ended up twisted with one side on the ground and the other up above the header of the house. I immediately contacted the office to have maintanence come and fix it but was greeted with the recording to press 0 for after hours maintanence emergencies. I spoke with the operator and explained the situation, that the door was not simply squeeky but literally twisted and that someone needed to call me or come to fix it immediately. She said she would contact maintanence and someone would call me back. Three hours go by and NO WORD from anyone at Acadian. Knowing that a great deal of belongings were in my garage NOT TO MENTION the fact that it could have been a serious safety issue if it collapsed completely I contacted an aquaintence I knew who worked with garage doors. He drove out from Sac to fix the door late last night. Still no call from them by 11am this morning so I called the office to discuss the situation  1) reimbursement for person who did fix the door and 2) protocol for reporting after hours emergencies. The receptionist stated I would not be reimbursed because that is not their protocol and verified that with the manager.  I asked to speak with the manager and Joe picked up the line. I started to explain my concerns about the lack of response regarding the door and he immediately told me the circumstance did not constitute an emergency and that since I opted to go out on my own because I was impatient and could not wait he would not pay me a dime. I was shocked, to say the least. He had no information about the garage door and the severity of the situation and DID NOT ASK for details regarding the maintanence request. He operated on an assumption and stated that he did not need to respond because by law it did not constitute an emergency. I explained I was unable to open, close or do anything with the garage and that I explained this to the operator who took the message. He stated that that operator doesnt work for Acadian so it doesnt matter. OK, uh, this is on YOUR office message but Joe did not take any responsibility for the person they directed me to and her statement that someone would call me back was on her own doing. Hmmmm. Joe continued to be rude and said that he was not going to sit and listen to me all day in an attempt to get reimbursed when I was antsy and couldnt wait for them to fix the door. I tole him to put the reimbursement issue aside and wanted to discuss why I never got a call from someone to assess the situation he said it didnt matter. When I stated I was concerned about it being a safety issue not only for my children and me, but neighbors or more damage to the house he said if anything were to happen to your kids it would be your fault if you are such a poor parent you let them play out there when the garage is like that.  OK, that was enough for me. I was flabbergasted and speechless. I asked him if this is how Acadian provides customer service and he said you are not my customer and I owe you nothing.  AH. I see. He went on to say this was not a deli and he was not my waiter and he did not have to listen to my false complaints when I was the one in the wrong. He said the conversation is now over and hung up on me.

As a professional working and living in Davis for over 12 years I have never encountered such poor treatment from another business. I attempted to call the owner after finding her phone number on a webpage and mentioned I wanted to discuss the situation with one of her staff. She said call the office and hung up on me. Well, the apple does not fall far from the tree. I was supposed to call the office and talk to Joe to file a complaint about...uh, JOE?

I was able to find the name of the owner of the home but do not know how to get additional information to reach him via email, phone or mail. I would think he would be HIGHLY concerned about how this so called PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY actually doesnt manage things well at all, especially legitimate concerns of the tenants.  I guess in the future I should not be so concerned about the damage to the property if ACADIAN could care less.  I just resigned a lease and I am wanting to end any relationship with them. They are rude, uncooperative, unhelpful, inconsiderate, demeaning, lack communication and have absolutely no sense of professional conduct whatsoever.

20090707 15:33:00 nbsp Acadian is by far the worst property management company Ive ever dealt with. I thought King Properties in Davis was bad, but let me assure you that after you deal with Acadian, King Properties looks like heaven. Apparently when you sign your lease with Acadian you give them the right to charge you ANY amount for ANY service request you make. DO NOT SIGN THEIR LEASE!!! They will rip you off every chance they get. They tried to charge us almost $200 because two of an electrical shortage in the wiring and they claimed it was tenant caused!! WHAT??? That was just the start. Trust me, you would rather live in a box on the street than rent from this company. STAY AWAY!! Users/Deanna

20090707 16:05:02 nbsp DO NOT Rent from Acadian! I have rented a few places in Davis over the last five years and Acadian Prop. is by far the worst.  I wish I never signed the lease with Acadian.

20090902 12:00:51 nbsp Well theres not much left to say than you shouldnt already know by reading previous reviews and comments. Acadian properties is by far the best worst property management company in Davis. Properties arent exactly managed and some are left ramshackled compared to similarly priced apartments in Davis. When I moved in all they did was clean the carpet. The kitchen sink was disgustingly filthy, grease stains still on the stove, bathroom mirror cabinet still had residue from previous tenant. Pretty yucky stuff. Dont rent here, period. If you do rent here just hope you never run into a problem. The conditions I mentioned were never addressed or fixed by the Acadian people. They dont care about you or the property. They are rude and pathetically smug about their crappy job; especially the two desk queens you encounter walking in there. What a horrible way to live your life. Theres no pride in being a loser asshole of a shit property management company. I dragged my rent check though some pretty nasty places before I handed it to them. I actually stood around and waited to personally hand the check to them instead of dropping it off in the box. Also, get a receipt for everything.  Users/AnonymousStudent

 First of all:  dont do it!!!
 There are a lot of comments here from a lot of major wiki people using their real names (in addition to a ton of anonymous edits).  Most of us regular editors would be happy to talk to you in real life, and stand behind our statements with our real name.  Users/BrentLaabs
  Most people that post reviews either have an amazing experiences or terrible ones, especially for management companies. Anyone have an okay/decent experience with them. One person in our groups dad knows contracts and will sort that out before signing anything, we also plan on documenting everything. As long as were safe and careful; if the house is amazing, should we pass it up because of this management company? Thats my new question! Users/mperkel
   A lot depends on who actually owns the house  Acadian just manages it, and doesnt control how much gets spent maintaining it.  If you have any communications with them that are not selfdocumenting (like rent checks), be sure to send it certified mail (or at least return receipt).  They have a habit of losing paperwork.  Never try to address a problem with them in person; theyll just ask you to leave the premises.   Users/BrentLaabs

20100315 17:30:54 nbsp to mperkel:  having a contract thats well written doesnt mean you wont get taken advantage of.  i am currently considering suing acadian, theyve committed several documented abuses, and then tried to use an unenforceable clause in the contract (which wasnt even my lease, was someone elses), as an excuse for their behavior.  however, i went down to yolo courthouse, and of the 4 dozenish suits filed against acadian and owner lisha shaw, very few have won.  am attempting to track down the ones who settled or dismissed, as im guessing those acadian may have paid, to avoid further damages.
laws only have teeth when theyre defended.  meaning acadian can (and apparently does) break the law whenever they want.  its not considered criminal, its a civil case. so its up to the tenant to exercise their rights.  after exercising my rights, ive been harassed, etc.

has anyone successfully threatened/sued them?  if so, please respond or email me at damnrain at yahoo.com thanks Users/imbnotp

20100422 16:17:56 nbsp so as for Everyone at Acadian is pleasant until you sign a rental agreement I went down there to talk with them about a property and offhandedly mentioned to this guy that Id be the only one on the lease and that I planned to sublease the second bedroom and the guy didnt just tell me we dont allow subleases but that subleases are illegal and when I said that I had subleased in Davis multiple times before with no problems that that also was illegal and my subtenant was an illegal resident and if she burned down the house or refused to pay rent I would have no legal recourse (despite the fact that you know, I had gotten a signed legal sublease through my landlord, yadda yadda yadda). I tried to point out the ridiculousness of saying I was engaged in illegal practices for a while (subleases are hella common in Davis, both the city and the university provide legal forms for subleases, I did it legit through my landlord at a large apt complex, etc.) before I gave up. He was just oh Ive worked here for ten years and I know what Im talking about blah blah blah and left.
Then later when my roommate (prospective subtenant candidate) called to complain about the guys attitude, the lady not only refused to let her talk to the manager, but instead of just taking her complaint, said oh I overheard the conversation, your friend never mentioned anything about a sublease, blah blah blah, just so you know both sides of the story as if my best friend of 10 years was going to take HER word over mine about what happened.
We were proceeding with caution on this listing as it is, so yeah, definitely wont bother with Acadian again. Users/KellyCorcoran

20100716 12:36:34 nbsp After reading all the comments about Acadian on Davis Wiki, I spoke to them and asked for their reactions and to comment. I was considering leasing a house from them and wanted to see what they had to say. I am not a student and have no relation to Acadian (other than being a renter now). I asked about the owner of the house I wanted to rent, the procedures needed to get maintenance done, what can Acadian do before they need to contact the owner (work valued at less than $200), etc.

After my discussions with them, I decided to lease with Acadian on July 1, 2010. Although I have not been dealing with them for a long period of time, they have been extremely responsive when any maintenance request has been filed. I may be dealing with different Acadian employees than previous posters had been dealing with, but I have zero complaints. If anything, I am pleased at how they respond, without any problems or hassles. I urge anyone who wants to lease from any property management company to communicate early and often before you sign a lease  that is common sense.

I may think differently later on, but for now, I am happy with my decision.  Users/PeriSiepman

20100720 14:36:09 nbsp A letter came in the mail from Acadian.  The name changed to Ally properties, something new to hate.  It was on Acadian letterhead and said that the address remains on B street but just address checks as Ally properties. Users/shraken

20100831 19:03:09 nbsp THE WORST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT IN DAVIS!
I have rented an apartment from two other places with relatively no complaints. But Ally, formerly Acadian, are by far the rudest and most inconsiderate people. They threatened me, called me a bitch, and the guy tried to get in a fight with me when I was just fed up and walked away. Who does that? This is not how you run a business. Yeah, they were pretty nice before I was just looking for an apartment, but once I signed the lease, it gradually changed. I would request for maintenance to come fix things since the properties are very old, and they would sometimes just hang up on me when I told them they were an hour or so late for my scheduled maintenance/repair request. The deposit is the highest of any place in Davis by far.

STAY AWAY! BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. After all, someone did make an Acadian Sucks website because they obviously were that horrible.  Users/JasonK

20100921 15:18:40 nbsp Disclaimer: I will update with a new post every day until this gets settled. Ally property management, if you read this, I am very very unhappy about our current situation. We will be contacting you and hoping this gets resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible. I will post if it does get resolved, and if it doesnt I will post our specific location and tell the current tenants there immediately of the situation so that they can be sure to prevent you from cheating them the same way you appear to be cheating us.

Backround: Rented house on   . Rent was 1875 a month, security deposit was $2345. Rented the place because it fit the need for a 4 bedroom+ garage in a quiet neighborhood in north davis, and we knew and were friends with the previous tenants. We were close enough friends with the previous tenants that we actually spent alot of time helping them move out  we know exactly what condition it was left in, and what condition Acadian left it for us. The previous tenants warned us about the following: Very leaky roof, carpet that was complete crap (and estimated 0 dollar worth by the cleaning company who came and cleaned it). We moved in to find that literally nothing they had left had been cleaned up by Acadian (they had left stuff in the garage, left the front yard in dire need of maintenance, and broken fixtures everywhere, with walls, blinds, windows, and window screens in very beat up condition. The oven and stove had not been cleaned very well, and there was a broken burner. We were uncertain if anybody had even been by the house before they turned it over to us. It was in exactly the same condition when they moved out as when we moved in  Acadian had done nothing. It turns out the roof did leak all over the house, and after 2 years of us calling Acadian and telling them to fix it 23 times a week during the rainy season, they were still unable to fix it.

We took pictures of literally every inch of the house, to make sure there would be no problems down the line  hopefully it wouldnt be a problem, but we figured just in case. We also took pictures detailing the outside of the house.

When we moved out, we left the place in significantly better condition then we found it in. Carpets were in about the same condition because there was very little we could do about that, we had fixed all of the fixtures, left everything significantly cleaner then we found it, and significantly less broken. We also carried out all of the trash, and cleaned the garage out completely, something the previous tenants (and more importantly, acadian) had neglected to do.

We thought we were pretty smooth sailing, because we literally have photographic evidence detailing how much better things looked when we moved out then when we moved in, so I was shocked and dismayed to find that 977 dollars had been taken out of our security deposit when I opened the letter today, to clean and fix things that were both clean, and already fixed. Given that we returned the house in better condition in every way then we found it, we are very very unhappy with being charged that much.

Anybody considering signing a lease with Ally: be very very careful to take extremely detailed pictures of every square inch of the house. They make their money on students who dont have the time or wherewithal to make disputes on their bullshit charges.  Users/William42


20101015 14:29:03 nbsp Hello everyone, I have a $ 20 question!!!
What are the possibilities to get charge for carpet cleaning twice? After  I got my deposit back I  found out that they charge me $ 220 for professional carpet cleaning, however I  did professional carpet cleaning on last day of my lease for $75 and i did both email them and hand them the receipt of the professional carpet cleaning which i done. One more thing I  did live there for 2 years and technically I am just responsible for big stains, not even the whole carpet cleaning. AVOID ACADIAN “ALLY”  ,THEY ARE SCAM. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE RECORD OF RENTAL PROPERTY BEFORE  YOU MOVE IN AND WHILE YOU ARE LIVING THERE.ALSO FINAL INSPECTION IS A MOST THING, AND WITHOUT INITAIL MOVING INSPECTION DO NOT MOVE IN TO THERE RENTAL UNIT.

20101117 15:10:59 nbsp Acadian / Ally property is the worst! I called to ask about a security deposit, the man on the phone proceeded to talk to me in what I took to be a hostile tone. When I confronted in about his rudeness, he merely argued You dont know me, you dont know anything about my tones a fking dog knows when you are yelling at it, it doesnt need to know shit about you. I tried to calm him down, but he of course cuts me off, and does not let me reason with him at all, instead he just says good bye and promptly hangs up the phone.

Besides the awful employees that seem to work there (the bald scarecrow, the overweight wannabe chola, etc..) they are pretty shady Additionally, Acadian Properties DOES NOT use the Davis Model Lease, which most other companies in Davis use and offers better protection to tenants.

I would not recommend renting from them, while terrible landlords are bountiful in Davis, this one takes the cake. No matter how smart you think you are about dealing with them, in the end they will still fck with you. period. Is it really worth it?

They make their money off of students who do not have the time or resources to deal with their bullshit. Users/AmiL

20110115 12:31:50 nbsp My husband (61 yrs) and I(51 yrs) rent a townhouse for $1325.00/month through Ally Property Management. Beginning of December we had a leaky roof that did damage (mold and water stains) to the ceiling right over our bed. They came out and fixed the leak, but chose to wait until the next big storm passed to fix the ceiling. After the New Year we rang to remind them that the ceiling was still moldy. We got the receptionist and she said she would pass the information on. Almost a week later they entered our home without giving us prior notice. No call back from our original call or a call from the people they hired to do the work. We had Ally out before because they said they needed to check our furnace. We made it clear then, that we did not want anyone in the house when we were not their and that both my husband and I are off work by 1:00pm and if we know they are coming we can make sure to be home. (The checking of our furnace was being handed a new filter through the door, we rushed home to be there, when they actually could have just dropped it off.) Yesterday, they entered our house and we did not even know they were coming. This is a problem for me, they have in their lease that there would be four hours notice when they needed to enter the premise. I always thought that landlords needed to give us at least 24 hours notice. We did not even get a phone call four hours before to say they would be in our home. The big problem came when I called to tell Joe, (lovely man before the contract was signed), that I had a problem with people being in our home without being notified. He could not figure out what my problem was, that I should not be telling him how to do his job, and that if I need notice, that maybe they would not be out in such a hurry. TAKE NOTICE HOMEOWNERS, HE WILL LET YOUR HOUSE BE DAMAGED JUST TO PAY ME BACK FOR COMPLAINING. He then went on, talking over me, saying that I was out of line and his solution was if I want privacy I should buy my own home. I asked to speak to his supervisor and he said he would not let me speak to her. He was VicePresident of the company and on the board and so I was getting no further than him and that this conversation has ended goodbye. VICEPRESIDENT AND BOARD MEMBER OF ALLY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT BASICALLY TOLD ME TO SHOVE IT. Why? Because I want to feel safe in my home and be able to live without locking up my purse, phones and other valuables because I do not know who may be entering my home while I am away. I could be in the home by myself asleep or in the shower and not come to the door. I would have been scared sh..less if I heard someone enter my home who was not expected while I was in the shower. My purse was left at home wide open on the table, my Ipod sitting on the counter among other small valuables. My guess is, that would be my problem too and not theirs. Did the ceiling get fixed, yeah, the painted over the mold without even bothering to match the color, the mold is already showing through. I wonder what they charged the owners for that piece of maintenance. I will be tracking down the owners of the house and asking them to change management companies. I will be moving out when the contract is up unless the management is changed, dont want to, but will not support any company that thinks I have no rights just because I am a renter. Their name may have changed, but not the poor customer service and attitude towards renters. Users/kmcclean

20110116 06:29:53 nbsp DO NOT RENT WITH THEM! If you read up, I was skeptical that they were that bad and their criticism. Luckily we found another house by a private landlord which has turned out great! Acadian/Ally is terrible, properties are horrible conditions. The one house we loved (on Oak) was just horribly run down. The current tenants warned us not to sign with them. The mold was so bad in the bathroom and another wall you could literally push them in. Also, I guess a few times a year, your fecal matter comes up the drains. The company didnt do anything to help. They are slumlords who just upkeep the property to turn over to unsuspecting students every year. Yes, they will pressure you and have deadlines, of couse some other student will be right behind you to sign that property if you dont. Save yourself the time and money! Users/mperkel
