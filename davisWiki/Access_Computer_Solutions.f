20120809 19:58:44 nbsp Cant say thank you enough to Mike at Access Computer Solutions. He was thorough, professional, super easy to work with and had me back up and running in no time. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for help with their computer. Users/Connienunez

20120811 17:28:38 nbsp Very helpful and professional. Lets face it, if I knew what I was doing then why would I have someone fix my computer for me? Mike listened to, and understood my problems and was able to fix them for me. It was so easy. I felt confident through the whole process. He not only fixed my problems, but gave me pointers on how to use my computer better.  Users/JaradLavelle

20120930 22:48:46 nbsp I came over to these guys panicking after water damage to my laptop  I thought it was pretty bad. They took it apart, dried and cleaned out each part, and I am typing it from the very same computer! Yeay! The service was great, especially that they were quick and great about keeping me updated on the progress too. Extra points for student discount :) Users/geej09
