Their web site says that the Acme Theatre Company is an NonProfit Organizations nonprofit independent, selfsustaining community Live Theatre theatre group for young artists of high school age. Its mission is to present plays of high literary quality while providing opportunities for young people to learn various acting and technical skills. Acme Theatre Company is an organization run entirely by the young people themselves under the direction of a small cadre of adult mentors.

Acme is open to all graduated 8th  12th grade students in the Davis and Yolo County area.  There is no cost to participate in the company.  Auditions are held prior to each production.

Acme performs in the Veterans Memorial Theatre.  Annually over wiki:WikiPedia:Memorial_Day Memorial Day Weekend, a free outdoor performance is given as a gift to the town of Davis for its many years of support.  For many years, these performances were held on the Pence Gallery stage, which disappeared with the gallery renovation.  Currently, performances are held on the outdoor stage behind the Davis Art Center.

For further information, contact Artistic Director, Emily Henderson at MailTo(emilymhenderson AT gmail DOT com).

In addition, the members of Acme are the directors/producers of theatre classes: Potpurri, Initial, and Awkward run through the City of Davis City Parks & Community Services Department Rec department for young kids in the summer. These classes are lots of fun with small shows performed by the kids as the finale of each class.
