20051206 16:11:22 nbsp Weve taken pets here for years its a great place Users/AntoniaOakley

20060112 20:15:36 nbsp my hamster was sick and when we took him in the staff and vets were very friendly and made us feel relaxed. good place to go, at least from my experience with my hamster. Users/ArlenKwong

20060112 21:38:11 nbsp I wonder if this place take student interns ?  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20060127 12:32:11 nbsp This place is great but I dont think they knew too much about pet rats. My pet rat supposedly had cancer (according to the Woodland vet) but before I considered the Woodland Vet clinic, I saw one of the Vets at Acorn (because it was my regular Vet) and she said that my rat probably had an infection and prescribed antibiotics. Well the night my rat died, I rushed him to the Woodland ER and it turned out he didnt have an infection, he had cancer that had already spread so it was too late and we euthanized him. I wish I had gone to a more knowledgable Vet, maybe I could have saved my rat from any pain and suffering. The staff is great, nonetheless. Id recommend them for dogs & cats and maybe other pets, but I would rather stick to Midtown Animal Clinic for my rats.  Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060202 15:10:04 nbsp Krystal, was a necropsy performed on your rat?  If not, how do you know it was cancer and not an infection?  Rats frequently get pneumonia that looks very much like cancer.  Im just saying one vet might have thought it was an infection and the other might have thought it was cancer.  The only way to know for sure would be to do a necropsy and submit the sample to pathology for testing. Users/LeslieCooper

20060202 15:10:04 nbsp Leslie, you made a good point. I just lost a rat last week to pneumonia and my first rat showed the same symptoms so it probably wasnt cancer to begin with. The vet I saw at Acorn said I think its an infection, lets give him Baytril and see if that works where as the vet in Woodland took xrays and saw a malignant tumor and concluded that it was cancer.. But in the past 2 months Ive been to three different vets (2 were out of town in SoCal) and I still feel that Acorn is not as knowledgeable about rats as I hope, not saying they arent knowledgeable about them at all because they did give me some good advice about rats for an entire year and even performed a lump removal on one of my rats while he had a respiratory infection (which came out to be a success). Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060329 11:00:26 nbsp They are knowledgable on rabbits. Not all vets in Davis are so its good to know of one that is. Users/LaurenMcNees

20060331 16:55:55 nbsp Agreed. They are very, very rabbit savvy, and good rabbit vets are hard to find. Ive had great experiences with them (particularly Dr Borges) and the Sacramento House Rabbit Society also recommends this clinic. Users/StephPolizzi

20060418 17:20:13 nbsp Acorn is not knowledgeable about hamsters. They too gave my hamster baytril for his illness (which I believe is cushings disease now) but basically didnt do anything to help him. Not very knowledgeable and they seem like theyre disorganized. They just wanted to take my money. Users/ArlenKwong


Just because a misdiagnosis was made does NOT mean a vet is not knowledgeable. Medicine is merely a process of ruling out certain conditions through treatment, starting with the least aggressive and most economical approach (unless the owner opts otherwise) and working from there. Arlen, what is it that makes you think your animal has Cushings? Have your forked out the money for an ACTH blood panel to diagnose this? The cost of this test is twice that of Baytril; if Acorn really wanted to rip you off they wouldnt have started with the least profitable treatment. Doctors and veterinarians arent God, they make mistakes. This is NOT a reflection of their quality of care!  Users/KristaSchreffler


Weve taken our cocker spaniel here since weve had him and have been very happy with the care hes received.  We adopted him when he was 6 months old and he was infested with every intestinal worm imaginable.  The vets at Acorn identified all of them, gave us the appropriate medicine, and within a week he was a hundred times better (and worm free).  Weve also had him neutered here and that went well also (well, maybe not for him).  Regardless, the day after his surgery he was back to his normal self.  Everyone at Acorn, from the receptionists to the vets, has been very friendly, helpful, and I have the utmost faith in them.

20060630 12:32:31 nbsp Krista, they did not seem like they geuinely gave two shits about my pet and they never called me back to let me know when medicines/diagnoses came in: I HAD TO PESTER THEM to give me information about my pets condition and kept having to call repeatedly. I went to another vet who said he suspected Cushings disease but I was also recommended not to give my hamster the blood test because hes such a small animal and it could potentially kill him. P.S.: do you work for Acorn? Users/ArlenKwong

20070418 15:02:49 nbsp We love the folks at Acorn.  They have been wonderful to our pets and to us.  When we had our sweet old lab. put down they were so kind.  As for quality of care, I have no complaints.  Being a vet must be hard!  The patients cant tell them where it hurts or how long theyve been feeling subpar.  Vets have to use a lot of art, along with their science. Users/FreddieOakley

20070529 22:02:36 nbsp I have been going here for a long time and have tried many others in town. I would have to say they are the best private practice vets in town although they have made mistakes too. Get to know the vet that you like and try to get them. Borges is the best but I hardly ever get her! Users/DavisGirl

20070717 09:36:59 nbsp These are the nicest people who give wonderful care.  Theyve provided medical services to my pets for years. Users/FranceKassing

20071207 12:46:29 nbsp I took in my pets to both Acorn Veterinary Clinic and Mack Road Animal Medical Center. Acorn ran more like a business in terms of money and concern for my pet. Mack Road always called me back and made sure their service was up to par. They once even told me to bring my pet in for a follow up, and when it came time for the bill they did not charge me. I always had to call Acorn back because they never called when they said they would. Especially for small pets, I suggest going to a different clinic other than Acorn.  Users/RiyoKwong

20080415 23:27:25 nbsp Usually, I have to wait for over 20 min even with an appointment, and spend little time with the doctor and receive a large bill. They never call back to check on my dog. Not satisfied.  Users/jaron

20080523 17:48:33 nbsp I had a terrific experience bringing my rabbit to Dr. Codino.  We chose this clinic, because their vets came highly recommended by the Sacramento branch of the House Rabbit Society.  We called when the office opened and were given an appointment an hour later.  Dr. Codino was very nice and extremely knowledgeable about rabbits (having owned several herself!).  She recommended we administer IV fluids at home, and stayed in the examination room (along with the vet tech) to help us learn how to insert the IV and answer plenty of rabbitrelated questions.  Overall, the visit was very inexpensive (including the IV supplies), and our bunny was feeling better within an hour of the visit.  I would definitely return here for any rabbit concerns! Users/mgoodman

20080523 18:11:34 nbsp P.S. We received a very prompt followup call the morning after our appointment. Users/mgoodman

20090330 13:13:17 nbsp Acorn Veterinary is fantastic. All the staff are very nice. Dr. Borges in particular is amazing. She is so sweet and very understanding about personal situations. My dog was very sick and she worked with us to give him extra quality time. I would take any pet of mine to her in the future again in a heartbeat. We are so grateful for everything she did for us and our dog. Users/Deanna

20090424 14:28:48 nbsp I had my bunny spayed here last week, and shes doing great. Rabbit spays are supposed to be tricky, but they seemed to know what they were doing because she bounced back quickly, and never seemed like she was feeling much pain/discomfort. They come recommended by Sacramento Valley house rabbit society, and though the procedure was a bit expensive, but I was willing to shell out for a bunny expert. Users/AmitVainsencher

20090603 12:44:27 nbsp i just brought my kitty in for a checkup/vaccines and it was a great experience...everyone was so nice and helpful. They really tried to make me and my cat feel comfortable. I got the impression that they really cared and I definitely plan on making this my regular vet  Users/MargieVanHealy

20090820 16:20:59 nbsp Total props to Dr. Sally Borges and all the vets and staff at Acorn!  I took our best friend, Indy, a 7 yr. old Lab., in with a sore foot, and they have been so wonderful.  Aggressive diagnostics, honest feedback, and so compassionate. Every time I visit Acorn I am impressed all over again with their whole ethos.  Even when we have the saddest outcomes, we know wevew been in good hands.  Hope theres a special place in heaven for these folks! Users/FreddieOakley

20090904 20:15:29 nbsp The people here are very nice. I called right when they opened in hopes of getting an appointment for my dog that day for what looked like an infection of some sort, and actually got an appointment for 10:40 AM. Checkup, urine analysis and um.. cleaning, and antibiotics ended up only being about $140. They obviously love animals. Or maybe my dog is just amazingly adorable, hah. But really, they were very nice to my dog and to us as well. Users/JenniferGiang

20091214 23:20:11 nbsp I am very pleased with this place. They are very nice, seem to love animals. Caring for an animals health is never cheap, and a big commitment, but this is very reasonably priced compared to other places, and well worth a dog that you care about. It seems the only person upset here all have the last name Kwong. We get the point, your unhappy, but how many posts are needed. At times they may treat it like a business...but isnt that what it is? Im very satisfied and trust them with my pet again and again. Users/patrick82

20110328 14:33:02 nbsp I use Acorn for my dog, and they are always super friendly and welcoming. The wait can be a bit long sometimes, and you often dont know which vet youll be seeing, but no matter who I get I still feel Im getting a good service. Weve also had a few emergencies with our dog, and Ive always been able to get an appointment the same day I callsomething that is invaluable to me.
I guess their downside if the distance from West Davis (where Im near), but I think its worth the drive.  Users/Morganna

20110527 00:26:21 nbsp We take our cat and rabbits to Acorn for nonemergency visits with Dr. Borges and Dr. Codino (and emergencies when they can quickly fit us in). They have really gone above and beyond for our little ones.  Users/AsmaMaryamMohseni

20121202 13:25:24 nbsp We had to have my best buddy of 13 years put to sleep last week.  The staff at Acorn were WONDERFUL, from the lady on the phone to the vet and tech who came to the house. I called at 9 am on a Monday and they were here shortly after noon.  Their caring and compassion on a very tough day for us was very much appreciated.  Users/LisaBriggs

20130405 17:45:07 nbsp Acorn vet has the most amazing staff. Whenever I needed them they were always there to give me great advice. I could tell my dog trusted them and the staff always made my dog and I comfortable. All their services are wonderful and they are the best veterinary clinic I have ever been to. My hometown is in Orange County and all services at Acorn were at least half the difference, and with a lot more warmth and smiles. I recommend them highly. Users/MichaelFeingold

20130521 14:12:47 nbsp Please be wary of this place. Some vets are nice and some are not. They recommend too many procedures. I switched my vet and no longer take my cat here.  Users/oliviasmith

20130603 21:56:41 nbsp After a troubling experience with another vet in town, we took our golden/lab Nutmeg to Acorn about 9 years ago.  I cannot recommend this place more highly.  Doctors Jackman and Borges are committed, passionate, knowledgeable and caring.  At one juncture Nutty contracted a mysterious illness and simply would not eat.  Anything.  She was wasting away and 2 days from death when Dr. Jackman determined the culprit: salmon poisoning, a rare, difficult to diagnose illness contracted during a walk in the Oregon woods a few weeks earlier.   Not only did she save our dogs life, but Dr. Jackman (and the rest of the crew at Acorn) have provided meticulous care for her ever since, including seeing her through two bouts of cancer.  Further, the support staff at Acorn is attentive and personable.  You couldnt ask for a better place to take your pet!    Users/KennyRay

20140314 11:03:02 nbsp Wonderful kind and caring place for your pets. Thank you especially to support staff Nicole and Megan!  Users/AngelaGerould
