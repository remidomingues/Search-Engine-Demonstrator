Student Housing is demanding that the Bike Church be shut down. A letter from Chuck Huneke, the Assistant Director, Residential Education in UC Davis Student Housing informed the church that they needed to vacate.  The letter was sent on Oct 29th, 2008, and a copy of the letter in the entirety is below.

This is an entry for discussing and listing methods to get Student Housing and/or the Universitys powers that be to repeal this seemingly unjust ruling.

Bike Church Demonstration
We staged a rally of support for the Bike Church outside Student Housing on Thursday the 13th at 2pm. Over 50 people rode over, testified about their positive experiences at the Bike Church and we presented them with our petition signed by over 400 people.

The Eviction
On October 29th, 2008, UC Davis Student Housing sent the Bike Church a letter stating that we have until December 1st, 2008 to dismantle our structures, and until December 31st to completely remove all traces of the Bike Church from our current location. The reasons given essentially revolve around the perception that the Bike Church grounds are a health and safety risk, that our dome is an unapproved structure and a fire hazard, that our methods of collecting donations in the form of money and goods are a liability, and that the fact that we are open to the Davis communityatlarge is also a liability due to the presence of nonstudents in a housing area (a security issue). Student Housing has not given us any possible alternatives, stating only that we need to get out.

Needless to say, we are all quite shocked at this turn of events, especially given the amount of progress we have made in renovating our space, making it safer, cleaner and more functional. We are currently exploring a number of options for our future. But being an everoptimistic bunch of people, we are also looking forward to working with the university to stay in our present location that we have come to love, and which we have made so beautiful. The last thing you should expect is for the Bike Church to disappear completely. We will continue to exist, even if we have to do it somewhere else.

We need your help to keep the Bike Church going. Many of you have been blessed by the Church in the past, but we need your blessings and voices now.  http://www.petitiononline.com/SaveDBC1/petition.html Sign a petition, write some letters, spread the word! Participate in our future. The Bike Church has been there in your time of need... now the Bike Church needs your help.  Keep watching the wiki to stay informed.

Despite the order, the Bike Church will remain open for our usual hours, at least until the deadline. So come by, fix your bike, and get involved!

Sincerely,
The Bike Church Ministers

The Sacramento Bee recently http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/1380958.html reported on this story.

 Bike Church/Great Pedal Forward Great Pedal Forward Fundraising 

We are currently in the process of raising money to fund the transformation of the Bike Church into a better place.  The funds raised will go toward the Bike Church/Great Pedal Forward Great Pedal Forward, which is an initiative to increase our physical, organizational and administrative efficiency. This movement will create a more inviting and functional space, which will allow us to increase the population served by the Bike Church not only in the campus community, but also in the larger Davis community. It will also help us to use volunteers more effectively through a cleaner and more organized physical space and organizational structure. While the Bike Church has thrived and grown in its first four years, we need to raise money in order allow the Bike Church to create a sustainable foundation for serving the community for years to come.

We started things off with dance party fundraiser on May 16th, 2008. We raffled off bicycles and other goodies and had local DJs spining late into the evening. It turned out to be a massive party and we received $1440 from donations and merchandise sales. Thanks to everyone who attended and donated. We hope we can have a great party like that on a regular basis.

If you are interested in donating you can either purchase our Bike Church/Merchandise Merchandise or donate directly to us: contact MailTo(bikeministry AT ucdavis DOT edu).

For those interested here is some details about how much money weve been raising:


Bike Dome Deconstruction
Sunday, November 23rd starting at 9 a.m., we deconstruct the geodesic gazebo. Student Housing is unwilling to compromise in their eviction of the Bike Church or provide an extension while we search for a new home. While the Bike Church will continue to fight to remain, we will completely disassemble the dome by the December 1st deadline.

Come out, and help us to use this tragedy to build an even stronger community around the Bike Church! We need your hands, hearts and minds on Sunday and beyond. They can take away our shelter, but they cannot destroy our community, our spirit!

We will begin the morning with a short vigil of remembrance for the structure, followed by careful dismantling of the dome and wood platform. There shall also be food, music and celebrating, for our dedication to community, educational empowerment and sustainability through bike wrenching only grows!   Come for as long or as short as you like.

Bike Church Demonstration
The first demonstration was held at 2pm November 13th.  It was a great show of support with over 50 people riding and amazing testimonies about how the Bike Church has positively influenced peoples lives.

USE THE FOLLOWING TEXT AS A BASE FOR YOUR PERSONAL EMAIL TO UC DAVIS ADMINISTRATORS

SEND YOUR EMAIL TO: jchuneke@ucdavis.edu; bmpetitt@ucdavis.edu; ecgalindo@ucdavis.edu; fewood@ucdavis.edu; bikeministry@gmail.com

Dear UC Davis Administrators,

The Davis Bike Church has served us, the Davis and UC Davis community, for four years as a unique repository for tools, recycled parts, and knowledge about bicycles. During that time, thousands of us have been empowered through education received at the Bike Church. It is for this reason that we are troubled by the sudden eviction of the Bike Church from the University campus. Though we understand the concerns expressed about the Bike Church, we are frustrated by Student Housing Administrations unwillingness to work constructively toward viable resolutions. UC Davis  as a proud history of fostering the roots of unique community service organizations; consider the Experimental College, Craft Center, KDVS, the Bike Barn, Outdoor Adventures, and Unitrans as  examples. It saddens us to see the current UC Davis Housing Administration snuff the efforts of an emerging group of volunteers proving a valuable community service. We respectfully request that Student Housing, and other appropriate departments of the University, spend the time and effort necessary to allow Bike Church volunteers to comply with University regulations and thus continue to serve the community for years to come.

In the eviction notice sent to the Bike Church, Student Housing expressed several concerns which we believe are easy to resolve if the University staff would only communicate and collaborate with the Bike Church volunteers. Concerns about liability have already been solved by such organizations as the Craft Center, and it would be simple to implement a similar waiver system. Environmental Health and Safety concerns have been addressed since Student Housing first began to press the issue, and the efforts of Bike Church volunteers need only the review, additional guidance and approval from University Environmental Health and Safety experts. Fire Department concerns can be solved through communication and cooperation in implementing modern fire prevention. Monetary transactions of other campus organizations have been structured and regulated, and certainly clear guidance from University officials would allow the Bike Church to operate according to necessary accounting policy. Student Housings concern about the Bike Church serving nonstudent community members in a location near student housing seems unfounded since the EC gardens, with an equally immediate proximity to the Domes, has a long standing history of serving people from throughout the community.  Lastly, the Domes community approved and supported the Bike Church from its inception and continues to express clear and strong support for the Bike Church activities.

We implore the UC Davis administration to stay true to their public service, educational, and environmental promises by taking the time to work collaboratively with this grassroots community service project, rather than dismissively brushing it aside. The Bike Church volunteers provide education and a welcoming community for bicyclists, filling a niche that is neglected by other campus programs. Losing this organization may seem small compared to more pressing administrative concerns, but it would be a sad blow to the base of the UC Davis community and would reflect a lack of University support for community building, public service, and sustainability.

Sincerely,

The First Report & Call to Action
Read on; the email I received from Users/Darach Darach Miller has some details of The Churchs plight:

 For those of you who havent already heard, the Davis Bike Church has been evicted from its traditional stomping grounds of four years. This is a major bummer for those whove relied on its tool, part, and knowledge repositories, as the Bike Church is now in serious jeopardy.

 To make a long story short, the Bike Church contacted various University departments last year in an effort to coordinate a renovation of the facility according to appropriate regulations. We thought we were past the cease and desist stage and into the clean up to standards stage of a grassroots organization, a belief based on numerous communications between Bike Church Ministers and University officials that demonstrated acknowledgment and approval of the Bike Churchs existence on University property. Eventually, we got Student Housing to give us a list of what needed to be done. Thus began the Great Pedal Forward of the Summer of 08.

 Through spending thousands of volunteer hours and over a thousand dollars in community donations, we were able to complete a massive renovation that included a floor for the dome, new cabinetry, restructured facilities, and a level of organization never before seen n our humble facilities. Despite efforts made to communicate with appropriate departments about inspection and approval of our facilities, the officials (except at EH&S) failed to work with us to meet their demands. Nevertheless, we believed we were on track for becoming an Universityapproved fixture in the Davis bicycling realm. We had a final inspection scheduled for October 1st to decide the fate of the Bike Church, until things suddenly changed.

 Student Housing suddenly canceled the walk through inspection. After several weeks of no communication, we inquired about our fate. Chuck Hunecke, the Student HousingDomes liason acting on Student Housings behalf, declared that we were aliability and a fire hazard, and due to our open membership to the Davis community and intial establishment without specific approval, we mustvacate and dismantle our structures by December 1st and clear all tracesof the Bike Church from the Domes land by December 31st. This is a major setback, but also a new opportunity. Were not exactly sure of the future of the Bike Church, but we are investigating and pursuing all options available. We are currently working on temporarily moving our experimental education facility to the Experimental College gardens before pursuing a closer relationship with the City of Davis, who has supported us in the past and is doing all they can to help us in these troubled times. However, this is still unsure.

 How can you help?

 This Saturday, November 8th, Delta of Venus is hosting the Save the Bike Church Danceparty sponsored by New Belgium Beer and KDVS, featuring DJs Mr. Glass, Dog Tones, and Deacon Morgan. There will be a petition and letter writing station, as well as further information about a demonstration occuring next week. Well have more information about volunteering at the Bike Church, such as how to become a minister. Anyone can get involved in our nonhierarchal consensus organization, but were also looking for specialists in nonprofit organization. Come check it out, whether to get involved or just to show support by dancing the night away!

  May your chain be supple and your wheels true,
    Minister Darach

 Letter from Student Housing to the Bike Church 

This is the letter telling the Church that we need to vacate, sent on Oct 29th, 2008:

 Thank you for checking in with us to inquire about the status of the Bike Church.  We are aware that there is a group of people who would like to see the Bike Church succeed and offer services to the community.  There are actually a variety of updates I can share with you and I apologize for the delay as I am still in the process of talking to a couple of people responsible for addressing the recent concerns.

 As we look at the recent development of the Bike Church and its 45 year history on Student Housing property, there are a variety of concerns for our department.  One concern relates to the general risk and liability of this kind of operation on residential property.  Health and safety issues are always going to be under a microscope and any injury or concern is a liability for our department.  Another liability is the money and property you collect as “donations”, which can be a large concern for the campus and Student Housing if it does not meet strict regulations.  Now that you are a registered student group the Student Programs and Activities Office (SPAC) might be of assistance to you in this area as you grow (see UC Davis, Policy & Procedure Manual Sections 260 & 270).  Another health and safety concern relates to this organization having open membership to the Davis community and the security issues that can arise since this facility is located in a housing area.  The final concern is related to the fact that the Bike Church established itself on Student Housing property without specific approval and continues to operate and grow as its own entity.  The current location of the Bike Church results in our involvement and staff time to address any issues that arise.

 Student Housing has been notified by the UC Davis Fire Department that the Bike Church structure does not meet code and should stop being used immediately.  Along with the concerns from the Fire Department there are a number of requirements that the structure needs to meet to receive campus approval.  These requirements include items such as submitting detailed schematic drawings of the structure, receiving approval from multiple campus committees, and receiving official approval from Student Housing for use of the land.  Based on the time, money, and ongoing commitment needed to receive approval it does not seem like the Bike Church structure will be able to receive campus approval.

 Another reason for the delay in getting back to your group relates to our due diligence in finding a possible solution and positive outcome for everyone involved.  We have reconfirmed with the Fire Department their stance on the need to immediately stop use of the facility.  We have conferred with the UC Davis Office of Resource Management and Planning as to other campus options that might be considered.  In our research, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the Bike Church is now a registered student group with the Student Programs and Activities Office (SPAC) which, as previously mentioned, might be of some assistance in helping your organization.  We have made some initial contact with their office and had planned on meeting with them.  You should consider doing the same.

 We understand and appreciate the mission and goals you strive for with this program.  Many of your objectives are in alignment with Student Housing objectives as they relate to sustainability, recycling, promoting health and wellness, etc., but we are not in the bike repair business.  Based on the notice from the Fire Department and the other concerns listed above we need to have use of the Bike Church structure stop immediately and for the Bike Church in its’ entirety to be removed from Student Housing property.  The structure should be completely dismantled by December 1, 2008 and everything should be removed from Student Housing property by the end of this calendar year (December 31, 2008). We will be posting flyers in the next couple of days in the Bike Church area.  Anything you can do to help notify your members would be appreciated.

20081107 23:00:46 nbsp eff that, student housing is shady and UC centric! Bike Church needs to keep fighting! Users/StevenDaubert
    Heh, UCDs Student Housing is UC Centric? No wai!! users/EdWins ES
      Why should UCD housing care about helping people in the community fix bikes they use to commute in a bike centered town? There really is no need to try and enrich other peoples lives thru proverbially teaching people how to fish, especially when bike church people dont talk with code enforcement before erecting structures, and because its a potential fire hazard, and non students come on campus, and UCD could get sued!  Users/StevenDaubert
           They shouldnt. They should just build more parking garages. Its much Tarmackia cheaper and safer. Users/TyNowotny
           Student housing should care because its projects like these that make UCD an attractive and interesting university to attend, at least on the sidelines.


20081108 11:57:11 nbsp I am one of the ministers at the Church, and I would like to make a small clarification before wrong information gets too far. The part of the letter that says that housing made several shady unannounced inspections before canceling the walkthrough is not true, at least not to our knowledge. What happened is the walkthrough scheduled for Oct. 1st was canceled on Sept 23rd. On Oct 8th, during our open hours, a couple of UCD Police officers came through with a list of license numbers and began searching through our bikes, ostensibly looking for stolen property. They found none. That was the first unannounced inspection. The second was on Oct 15th, when a representative from Student Housing was found walking around the Church, taking photos. That was a little more alarming, so we sent a letter to SH asking to reopen lines of communication, as we had heard barely a peep out of them for over a month. They sent back a letter telling us to GTFO. History in the making!! Users/TyNowotny

20081111 13:17:06 nbsp Heres a minidoc for the Bike Church: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v33aBxHPxhug .  I hope to do some filming at the demonstration to weave into the doc.  Hopefully documenting the passion of community involvement may help out with our efforts to keep the bike church in its natural habitat.   Users/AyseG

20081112 11:37:31 nbsp Been fixed. Users/Darach

20081113 16:23:45 nbsp Novel idea: can the place at all be moved?  Strange idea, I know, but if Student Housing can help select a site they do approve of, and the Bike Church folks can relocate, then you might be able to thrive and grow with the Student Housing departments blessing.  ~~~~ Users/JeffWood

Move where? Darach

20081113 20:21:36 nbsp SPAC specifically indicates that groups are open to community membership...Student Housing needs to read SPACs documents more closely. Users/AlexMandel

20081115 09:22:59 nbsp :(
I like the bike church and all it stands for. Users/ChristyMarsden

20081116 06:29:14 nbsp I think UCD Housing should remove the Bike Church from its current location.  It should remove them and help them to become a member of a more appropriate University department that will provide them with an indoor place where they can continue operations.  Even more, UCD should put the Church in charge of the masses of Bike Auction abandoned bikes that TAPS reclaims each year.  Further, UCD should support the Church in the organization of a Bike Church/Yellow Bike Yellow Bike program.  These are some steps that I think might help UCD might turn this conflict into a mutually agreeable solution, leaving all parties better off than before.  I think its perfectly understandable that UCD Housing doesnt want to be responsible for the Bike Church, but its a huge mistake of the U itself lets that be the end of it. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20081122 12:23:43 nbsp It is my opinion (and this is only conspiracy theory) that the only viable reason to shut down a service as wonderful as the bike church is that it would harm local stores such as walMart Unspeakable Evil and some of the thriving local repair shops.
Perhaps theres some pressure from the town? Anyway, I dont know. Users/MasonMurray
