Describe Users/ActionFigureBarbie here.

Would the world be a better place if GI Joes were called dolls instead of action figures?  Or Barbies were called action figures instead of dolls?  Maybe.  Ill give it a shot.

I wish this was a real thing: http://laughingsquid.com/zombieattackbarbie/

20111221 19:19:30 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki! Users/TomGarberson

20111222 17:38:59 nbsp Yes, welcome!  Thanks for http://daviswiki.org/Identity/Talk?actiondiff&version243&version142 your comment on Identity/Talk.  That needed to be said.  And I love the idea of Action Figure Barbie.  Users/CovertProfessor

20111222 18:12:52 nbsp Thanks CovertProfessor!! Ive completely enjoyed reading your comments over the past few years on DavisWiki! I was hooked when I read UCD email etiquette my thoughts exactly.    Users/ActionFigureBarbie
  Thanks!  cp

20111224 04:05:57 nbsp personally any world where we can ponder the merits of improvement based upon changing words / syntax and not worry about actual problems (food, health, shelter, the well being of others) is already a better place... That being said the action figure / doll distinction would be a product of the 70s / 80s and marketing or something?? Also the black bratz dolls are cheaper (by about $1.25) than the white ones, and last time I spent more than 30 seconds looking at one of those and specifically looking at the packaging I got really irked at the machine that spawns / maintains / sells them, and they way they go about doing it Users/StevenDaubert

20111224 09:09:49 nbsp StevenDaubert, it was a marketing decision on GI Joes part, boys would never play with a doll!  Words and syntax are incredibly important, how we create webs of meaning has very important implications in how we all live our lives.  Have you read anything by Frantz Fanon?  Youve opened my eyes on Bratz, thanks! Users/ActionFigureBarbie
  somehow my response to this got overlooked... here is the gist basically: Its not what you say its how you say it ←

20111224 14:18:16 nbsp Affect a change for the world to see on a local level

go to http://bradfordkern.com/Music.html and listen to the song affect a change I guarantee you will enjoy {{{O__O}}}


Hey, despite all the goings on and happenstance dont let it sour you on the wiki! I grew up in Davis and learned a bunch of cool stuff even I didnt know from the wiki. Its an amazing tool for collaborative authorship, if we could all share our experiences somewhere somehow. Its pretty powerful stuff, the wiki itself is just a vehicle or a vessel that we fill and the interactions that occur here could just as easily be a group conversation on any given corner in town...

long story short continue to come with it and dont feel dissuaded by anything/anyone...  Users/StevenDaubert

20111224 14:25:42 nbsp SD, thanks :)  I really love Davis and would love to live here forever.  DavisWiki is an amazing resource and Ive been meaning to get involved for some time.  I do, however, have a lot of holiday plans that I need to get on with!  I keep meaning to peel away from this.  If I disappear for a while, its due to holiday festivities and not sour feelings.  (Also, I guess I dont know protocol, should I write this on your user info?) Take it easy!   Users/ActionFigureBarbie

I too have been meaning to peel away from this but its just so enthralling...  Things of this nature occur on the wiki, but its usually a result of Procrastination or like this instance, serious policy changing discussion. Cest la vie... Yes, many people take Wiki Chill Pill if not often inadvertently, tis the holiday season. Did you get a chance to listen to that song? Totally worth 90 seconds of your life, and its from a Davis wiki editor nonetheless! Daubert
also I didnt realize how nice Davis was growing up, I figured everyone had something like Covell Greenbelt etc etc

20111225 12:08:44 nbsp I did listen to the song, and it was great.  I hope his music spreads around the world, its definitely uplifting. Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20111225 20:27:00 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for bringing up issues of gender and editing here.  You might be interested in this page from a little while ago: Wiki Community/Women (and it might be worthwhile to move some of the discussion on the Identity page there). Users/PhilipNeustrom

20111225 22:12:07 nbsp PhilipNeustrom, thanks for the welcome, and thanks for informing me of the womens page.  At first blush, it seems to me that the issues on identity, of which are greatly imbued with gender, make sense to stay on the identity page. Moving discussion to the womens page might relegate important issues that would be overlooked by those who are most directly implicated.  Ill check it out though.    Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20111225 22:24:04 nbsp PS, PhilipNeustrom, can you explain this to me?  Not sure I follow:  http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Wiki_on_the_Davis_Wiki?actiondiff&version22&version11 Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20111225 23:34:11 nbsp I think the reference to the daviswiki wiki was an attempt at derailing the discussion then by saying that this wiki is not Davis and navel gazing in general is offtopic. I disagree with that though and think the discussion and others on the wiki are legitimate. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20111225 23:56:51 nbsp Thank you NickSchmalenberger!  Thats what it seemed like... not sure what to make of that. Users/ActionFigureBarbie
 It looks to me like infamous tricker brent laabs is giving grade a snark about someone or something, but then again I just glanced Daubert

20111226 22:53:40 nbsp I deleted it.  ;) Users/CovertProfessor
 I saw, thanks!!!

20111226 23:03:55 nbsp And I am very glad that you spoke up in the first place.  It was one of those things that always bothered me, tickling in the back of my mind, but somehow never coalesced enough for me to approach it directly. Users/CovertProfessor
  I say a lot of things :)

20111227 00:30:12 nbsp you havent really proven a need to address the identity issue other than it could have a chilling effect, the wiki is already bursting at 10,000+ pages I think it will survive without the people who talk themselves out of participating/interacting in our glorious community (both online and off) for whatever reason.
That being said your remarks of I felt bad being told I was breaking the social norms but was going to do so and did so anyways kills my incentive to participate further in the discussion except for vociferously opposing your vendetta

I hope you can find a more productive way to edit the wiki (strictly from an adding content standpoint, it has nothing to do with your ideals or the manner in which you have suggested them)

Also: Click on info and then click links, if you want to rename the importance of using your realname then someone has to replace EVERY incoming link to that specific page  Users/StevenDaubert
  What?  I think your comment here undoes any goodwill cultivated since http://daviswiki.org/Identity/Talk?actiondiff&version297&version196 you referred to me as a horse that needed to be beaten to death:  Its almost like we have beat this horse to death and into the ground and a new one canters into town all fresh and brimming with zeal for this topic.  AFB
   Hopefully clarification is not needed, but SD referring to me as a horse that needs to be beaten to death is not the extension of goodwill, rather welcoming comments he made afterward that seemed somewhat reconciliatory or friendly in their essence were. AFB
     I respectfully suggest you stop being so offended. No malice has been directed towards you by anyone on the wiki.  Surely you have heard of the expression wiki:wikipedia:Flogging a dead horse beating a dead horse, no? Users/WilliamLewis
        Seriously?!  LOL!!!  <   Hey check it out, my easily offended lady brain does have a sense of humor.  Huh, who knew.  It seems you’re serious though.  I do find it funny that the wiki link you give states that the idiom “to beat a dead horse” is used to refer to intangible things like a futile conversation or an endeavor, not a person which is where SD seems to draw the connection with the cantering horse.  But you’re right, it’s silly for me to be offended by objectification and violence.  It’s true too, that it’s not malice when I’m told that I’m dismissive to all men http://daviswiki.org/Identity/Talk?actiondiff&version286&version185 here and  http://daviswiki.org/Identity/Talk?actiondiff&version2122&version1121 here, even if you find some evidence to the contrary.  It might not even be malice when I’m encouraged to http://daviswiki.org/Users/ActionFigureBarbie?actiondiff&version219&version118 move conversation to the women’s page, which come on, let’s face it, really serves only to derail any conversation.  All that might not be malice, but it is all an incredible display of civil sexism.  It’s cool though bro, I’m taking a break for a short while.  What will I do?  Listen to some early Alanis Morissette and shake my fist at men?  Ha!  Look at that, more humor!   –ActionFigureBarbie

            I was trying to be helpful in my suggestion to move some of the material from the Identity/Talk page to the Wiki Community/Women page.  Theres a good deal of general discussion about womens participation on the wiki which might be good to move or integrate there, and the page hadnt been edited in a long while.  I wasnt trying to detrail a conversation.  We like to organize and collect things on the wiki.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

I think your calling the editors participating in the discussion at Identity/Talk sexist is unfair and counterproductive to the discussion.  While not everyone has education on gender and priviledge (and youre right that everyone would be wellserved by taking a Gender Studies class), by calling people who are otherwise engaged in a civil discussion sexist you immediately polarize the discussion and make participants uncomfortable with continuing to participate.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

 PhilipNeustrom, where were you when TG told me http://daviswiki.org/Identity/Talk?actiondiff&version294&version193 here that the only sexism he’s seen in that conversation is me apparently hating men?:  “Honestly, Ive had the same thought as Don several times in this conversation. Everything said by men seems to be ascribed to malicious intent. The only sexism Ive seen on this page in the past few days has been on that front. The best writer and oralist (yeah, yeah, crack your jokes)….”  His claim about me is patently untrue; I have not ascribed malicious intent to every man here.  I’m going to take not a longterm but longish break so that things can be more productive.  AFB

     I agree with you that you never said anything that would warrant the accusation that you ascribe malicious intent to any mens comments here.  Its unfortunate that your mentioning that all the commenters (at the time) were male was taken as a slight, and I agree that some of the comments about that were polarizing as well.  Ive noticed that its a pretty common thing when discussing gender with a group of males.  For instance, lots of guys, when they first hear about the idea of womenonly spaces, think thats sexist!  But its really an educational opportunity.  But its really a lot of work to discuss this stuff, and its easy for things to blow up and people to get frustrated.  And I guess Im just sad that happened here and Im wondering what we could do to make a productive conversation space on more sensitive topics.

     The problem with having discussions about sensitive topics on the wiki is that its a written form and its really difficult to ascertain tone or emotion in peoples writing.  I guess what Im getting at is: if were going to discuss this stuff in written form on the wiki then we should assume good faith.  If were going to discuss matters of priviledge and try and really address them then I feel like we need to have the safety to work together in a nonjudgemental way.  I think what often stops people from talking about race or gender is the fear of saying something stupid and coming off in a negative light.  But sometimes, in order to learn, youve gotta say stupid things and then talk about them.  Users/PhilipNeustrom


20111229 10:03:51 nbsp Hello, are you ready to discuss the survey that would assess the population in Davis who would love to edit, but cant due to RealName issue? I am asking because I think that topic would fit under a talk page of Wiki Demographics, and I will need either you or CPs input and review of the validity of the content of the survey.  Users/EdgarWai
 EdgarWai, thanks, I like your work on the RealNames page a lot.  However, I think I need to wait until things cool down to engage on this further.  I’ve greatly appreciated your amazing ability to see past all the intensity to the real issues at stake here.  AFB

20111229 13:07:35 nbsp Truth is a lot of girls arent on here because they think the whole concept of getting involved in a community of online strangers is weird, real names or not.  The ones that dont see anything involving computers past mouse clicking will either use real names or create anon accounts that do or do not reflect gender status.  Those who cant figure out how to even make an account...oy.  I hate it and our sex needs to start idolizing Jill Pantozzi and not Kim Kardashian.   Users/OliviaY
  Thanks for your comment.  I agree, something has to be done to get girls and women more involved in computers.  Its a much greater issue that permeates so many facets of society.  AFB

20111229 13:12:44 nbsp Thank you ActionFigureBarbie for such a warm compliment!   It started out holidays on a great note! :D   Users/TheInconvenientStore
 This note made me happy :) AFB
