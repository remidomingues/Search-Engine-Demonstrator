Action Blue College Democrats,also know as ABCD, is a rebel faction of California College Democrats.  Formed during the California Democratic Convention of 2007 the organization has members at various college campuses. Little is known of their purpose or ideology other than their enthusiasm to cause political coups on California College Democrat chapters in their pursuit of power.

The Davis chapter of the Action Blue College Democrats prides itself on its humble beginnings as they successfully launched a coup on the Davis College Democrats in a Volkswagon somewhere in Southern California after nine hours of executive discussion. ABCD Officer Steve Ostrowski was not at the convention but was granted an officer position due to his enthusiasm to the cause. Greg Webb also joined ABCD upon learning of its endorsement of Presidential Candidate Dennis Kucinich. ABCD members Steve Ostrowski, Greg Webb, and Joseph Bleckman hope to advance true democratic views through radio.
