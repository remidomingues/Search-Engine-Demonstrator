20080430 15:58:53 nbsp I had a banner made by Action Signs for a club I run in the veterinary school, and was very impressed. Paul was very helpful in finding me the most economical option for a good quality, weatherproof banner. He also helped me with the design and then even delivered the banner to my apartment when it was done! Id highly recommend Action Signs based on my experience! Users/GSB
