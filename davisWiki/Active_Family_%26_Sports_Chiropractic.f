20110802 10:36:31 nbsp Dr. Chu or as I call her Dr. Pain!  As a cyclist and bicycle racer I use muscles I never knew I had!  Any issue I have with muscles and cycling, Dr. Chu has been able to resolve and treat.  ART has been the best option for my needs and I cannot say enough about Rock Tape, it is a miracle tape!  Sure, I can purchase the tape on my own but it would not be as effective as if applied it to myself.  Dr. Chu always goes above and beyond, she knows her stuff!  I would recommend her to anyone having muscle issues! Users/KristenHill

20120531 21:05:20 nbsp Dr. Chu is the only chiropractor I refer my clients to now because as good as it feels to have your back cracked I no longer feel good about endorsing this method of chiropractic (otherwise known as high velocity adjustments yikes!) Adjusting joints without addressing the softtissue imbalance and strain underlying them just means youre signing up for indefinite chiropractic.

I am a massage therapist practicing full time now for 7 years and I believe the majority of chronic pain my clients suffer from poor posture and overuse can be very effectively addressed by ART, Dr. Chus preferred method of treatment, in combination with massage therapy,. ART stands for Active Release Technique and involves the chiropractor pinning the connective tissue while having the client engage and lengthen the muscle.

I am a semiregular client and I can tell you it isnt always pleasant but it keeps me working. In addition to the heavy load I place on my musculoskeletal system, I have a lovely history of car accidents (none of them my fault, I swear!) and whiplash that have taken a physical toll. ART with Dr. Chu has had a progressive healing effect on these injuries which is significant given that the initial window of healing has long passed.

I recommend the deep muscle work and kinesio taping to anyone who suffers from chronic pain that other doctors, PTs, massage therapists, surgeons, etc have said cant be fixed. She has a very high success rate and really you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

The most impressive thing about Dr. Chu is her integrity. She always tells clients that if they arent significantly, like mostly, improved within 6 sessions then shes probably not the provider they need. Very few chiropractors operate on this model of short term, resultsoriented treatment and its the icing on the cake for me when I send people her way. Users/LilyS

20140128 08:10:14 nbsp After reading the positive reviews here, along with the personal recommendation from an acquaintance I decided to visit Dr Chu for help with Sciatic foot and leg pain. The A.R.T. method she uses from my point of view was a very deep vigorous massage which actually made my problem worse. I was very disappointed and should have asked for my money back. I felt hurt and angry. She never explained what she was doing before she did it. I could sense while lying on the table that it was not good.  Dr Chu may be good for some people but she did not help me at all. Users/DavidJoshel
