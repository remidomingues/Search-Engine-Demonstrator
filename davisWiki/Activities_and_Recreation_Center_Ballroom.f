The Activities and Recreation Center Ballroom (ARC room #109) serves as a multipurpose room for UC Davis events; ASUCD has used the space, as has the Banduh. It can also be rented for weddings and other events. The facility is located beyond the northeast entrance of the Activities and Recreation Center. It is also used for the annual Intramural sports Intramural Poker PokerPalooza event in order to facilitate the 200+ participants.

A movable partition can divide it into two rooms: the west end becomes a large room (room 109B) and the east end becomes a small room (room 109A).
