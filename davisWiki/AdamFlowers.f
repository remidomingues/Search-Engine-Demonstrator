Name: Adam Flowers

I grew up on San Marino Drive off of Mace Boulevard in South Davis.  Our neighborhood was officially called Rancho Macero but most of us were unaware of that designate and simply referred to it as Our Neighborhood.  At the end of the street was the eastern terminus of the South Davis Bike Path Putah Creek Bike Path.  We could ride our bikes to Willowbank (crossing a wooden bridge spanning the creek) or further still past the tank house on Riccis Farm to Putah Creek Park.  Until I was about 5, this place was my whole world, with the exception of trips to IGA downtown or Lees Drugstore on G Street with my mom or mornings spent in Davis Parent Nursery School at Valley Oak Elementary School. At the east end of our street, where it met with Mace Boulevard, there was a storm drain complete with a rusted, heavy steel grate which had been dubbed by our elders, Hells Gate. Later, we would send daring reconnaissance missions into the darkness, usually to end with the person furthest in turning around and running screaming from the black depths.

My father, Mike Flowers, built my older sister Michelle and I a playhouse in our back yard.  Our property backs up to the North Fork of Putah Creek, so it felt as if a whole world of possibility was just over the fence.  He also built a basketball hoop in the driveway.  My father would often play HORSE with us when he would come home from work.  My mothers voice could reach any corner of the neighborhood, and she would call me in when it was time to wash up and set the table for dinner.

There isnt a day that goes by that I dont think of my familys home by Putah Creek on the edge of the city limits and memory.


>Image(MailmanHat.jpg, right, thumbnail, Adam+Mailman HatDork   1992)<  While a student at Davis High School, Adam could be seen driving Old Blue, his fathers 1958 Chevrolet Apache pickup truck.  It was also around this time that he took to wearing a United States Postal Service hat, in tribute to the onehit wonder hip hop group House of Pain.  This made Adam look dorkier than he could possibly imagine.  He was also involved in the infamous Rainbow Head Afro Mall Run at County Fair Mall along with Steve Walter, Gordon Bell, Ken Keilman and Lucas Taber in 1992.

Adam is a graduate of the Davis High School Class of 1993, a charter member of Keever, cofounder of Geniuses @ Work, an alumnus of Acme Theatre Co., a member of the twotime Grand Champion Davis High School Jazz Choir, former writer of the Devils Advocate column for the Davis High School student newspaper The HUB and a former member of the influential Davis band Abdominizer.

In 1993, Adam sang the National Anthem at the July 4th Fireworks at Community Park.
