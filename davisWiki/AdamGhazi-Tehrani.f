He began writing for the California Aggie Fall 2006 and is presumed to finish writing when he graduates Spring 2006.  His articles are roughly 33% Politics, 33% Culture, and 33% Sex.  That remaining 1% is just shit.

He hails from Northern California.
He can be found frequenting Sophias, Sushi Nobu, and random jacuzzis in and around the Davis area.

He wrote this personal page himself for fear one would never be created otherwise.
He hopes someone will update it and make it better.
