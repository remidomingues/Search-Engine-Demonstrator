 Resignation 
On December 5th 2004, Senator Adam Barr resigned.  His resignation statement is as follows from his now deactivated website at senator.adambarr.net:

 My time in ASUCD has been bittersweet. I have had the opportunity to represent the students of UC Davis to the best of my ability while simultaneously fighting a losing battle against politicians at the national level. I call this a losing battle because their influence has resulted in my ultimate resignation.

 It is no secret that most students on this campus feel that ASUCD is not important in any way. They view senators as powerhungry, selfcentered, arrogant, and blinded individuals who occupy their time with useless rhetoric. While I have never shared this view of elected officials in ASUCD, I did once question the relevancy of student government. It was not until becoming president of Men Acting Against Rape last year that I realized how ASUCD could be used to better support student organizations and therefore students. My bid for a senate seat was born from this desire to make ASUCD the chief facilitator of collaboration among campus organizations. I have spent much of my time as a senator working to unite student groups and reinforce that bridge between them and ASUCD. However, Washington bureaucrats have continually undermined that effort.

 When I spent last year opposing budget cuts to higher education with my colleagues in the Senate, I was not only fighting for others, but myself as well. The systemwide one thousand dollar decrease in financial aid this year has made my involvement in the ASUCD Senate an irresponsible activity. The small stipend that senators receive for the 1520 hours of work that they perform effectively prices out the less fortunate like myself. I currently have no extra time to devote to making the money necessary for me to remain at this university. It is necessary for me to leave my post and use that time to pursue additional ways of financing my education. I am leaving the ASUCD Senate to seek out another job to complement my position as an ET Partner in the IET Mediaworks department.

 Elected officials are often viewed as mere titles instead of actual people with real life problems. This statement of resignation is an attempt to humanize those people that put others before themselves in the pursuit of public service. I wish the newly elected senators and those still serving their terms the best of luck on their respective agendas. Furthermore, I urge the students of UC Davis to take a more active role in student government and make responsible decisions when voting for senators.

 I will continue to work on my personal projects, which can be found on this website. Further, I will work with the newly elected senators to help them in any way that I can.

 Respectfully,

 Adam Barr

 ASUCD Senator

20041205 16:39:59 nbsp I think that there is tremendous truth in his statement about not knowing how important ASUCD can be until you become active on Campus.  Having read Adams letters to the Aggie over time, I think hes probably one of the best.  Its sad to see him go, but money is pretty important.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
