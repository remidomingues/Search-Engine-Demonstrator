20050207 11:42:19 nbsp Wow!  I know a guy with a Davis Wiki page!  Stellar.  122 is the shit... Users/JeremyGimbel

20050223 22:07:11 nbsp I agree with you that Kai deserved an endorsement.  However, who knows what happened during his interview.  He is a calm and collected individual, but you never know how people will perform when surrounded by the Aggie editorial board.  I did rank Kai highly when I voted.  Users/AdamBarr

20050223 22:11:48 nbsp yeah, im a little disapointed that kai didnt get endorsed (obviously) but my issue has more to do with the general feeling towards Student Focus. There is a strong antiSF sentiment on campus and i think that they are becoming the scape goat for all ASUCD problems. i just dont want to see candidates overlooked by the voters just because they feel that its cool to hate SF  Users/AdamGerber

20050223 23:44:22 nbsp I think theres a difference between scapegoating for ASUCDs problems, and just not liking Student Focus agenda/just not feeling its in tune with what the campus needs. We havent had any seriously big problems in ASUCD like the 2001 rolling blackouts that prompted the gubernatorial recall, so there arent really big problems that were blaming on Student Focus. I think the general sentiment is just that Student Focus isnt in tune with what we want right now. But then again maybe Im missing something. Users/KenBloom
