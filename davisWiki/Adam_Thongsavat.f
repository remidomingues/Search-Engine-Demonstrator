 Senate Campaign Statement


Dear Friends,

My name is Adam Thongsavat and I am a thirdyear history major from Merced, California.  I served as Elections Committee Chair and an Assistant Director for Picnic Day for the past 3 years.  I am currently a driver for Unitrans.

I am running for senate simply for one reason: I want to see results.  I am tired of repeated and failed platform proposals; I am tired of candidates who go to senate to preside instead of providing real leadership.  And I am tired of seeing a great campus which I love not realize its full potential.  It is time we do things that matter and will have lasting impacts long after we graduate.

The Smart Party Initiative I want to promote awareness and influence city and university policy that is more favorable towards students who chose to involve alcohol in their outings.  By working with our Student Police Relations Committee, UCDPD, DPD, and the city of Davis, I want to create a one stopshop of information including everything from individual rights in regards to hosting a party, DUI, BUI, Minor in possession, and drunk in public.  I will also strongly advocate for a more favorable and reasonable noise ordinance policy directed at student renters.

Picnic Day Expansion We should work with our programming unit Picnic Day to provide more fundraising opportunities at Picnic Day, which includes food booths and commercial tents.  I would like to see more funds injected into preweek activities which would include a community concert the night before Picnic Day.

Downtown Davis Business Partnership with Cafés and Restaurants I want to work vigorously towards a strong partnership with select downtown eateries to stay open late during high capacity days such as finals week and Picnic Day to provide late night student patrons with a place to grab a bite to eat and expand study space alternatives.  My goal is to launch a pilot program by spring quarter.

Establishment of a Renter’s Rights Committee I want to coinitiate a bipartisan effort with Raj Kumar to establish an ASUCD committee devoted to research and advocacy on rights of renters on and off campus.  Raj and I think it is imperative to have an effective body to represent nearly a third of City of Davis residents who are students.  Immediate issues would include branding the Davis Model Lease as well as establishing a framework for constant updates and revisions so it can actually be used.

I have had some great experiences at Davis the friendships I have made here are invaluable and I am so grateful for them.  That is why I am so inclined that now more than ever is the time for me to contribute to the betterment of student life it is the least I can do for a place and people which have fostered some of the most fun years of my life.

Be Bold.  Join our campaign because UC Davis can do better.  Thank you for your time and I love you UC Davis!

Please vote Adam Thongsavat #1 and Raj Kumar #2
