 Adam Dead Baby Cow Veal 
Poet, Artist, Chef, Lover


Adam used to be the morning cook at Delta of Venus. He made the best food. He is the creator of the Adams Special. I dont think he eats veal, because that would be wrong.

Adam is a cool guy, one time in line at Davis Food CoOp the Coop the credit/debit machines went down and I was graced with his presence. It was nice to have a goodlooking guy ask me what my sign was, instead of some older grump complaining about the machines. He also sometimes likes pie.  Users/MichelleAccurso
