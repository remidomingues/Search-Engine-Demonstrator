I specialize in cognitivebehavioral Counselors and Therapists therapy and sex therapy for individuals & couples. My approach is primarily focused on finding solutions in the present to problems in the present, and I am especially fond of shorterterm problemsolving work rather than longterm explorative therapy. I often make use of mindfulnessbased interventions, especially for anxiety problems and depression.

I have extensive experience working with clients of all sexual orientations, genders, lifestyles & practices. I am an AASECTcertified sexuality educator, and a clinical member of WPATH, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.

In addition, I have worked for many years with clients with substance use & abuse concerns. My approach is based on the harm reduction model, which sees abstinence from substance use as only one option among many. I see each persons substance use as different, and therapy is based around setting and attaining realistic goals.

My therapy style is relaxed, easygoing, and interactive. If you think we might be a good match, call or email, and we can check in about whats going on for you. I am a SHIP network provider.

Used to be located at 719 2nd Street #16.
