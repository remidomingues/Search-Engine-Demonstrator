Every day, various media sources publish information that could be used to update the wiki  far more than any one person could take on and still have time for a life.  But what if we split the tasks up?  We could steadily add content to the wiki and really make it grow in a productive way.  Of course, there are to do many ways that one can contribute to the wiki; this is a proposal for another one.

 Proposal 

One day a week, commit to reading a media source of your choice (online and/or printed), Daviscentric, UCDcentric, or Sacramento Valleycentric, and find something to add to the wiki.  Your edit could be anything from a small correction to a fullblown brandnew page and everything in between.  You can cover politics, local things to do, businesses, controversies  anything!  Pick a topic that seems interesting and go for it.

http://daviswiki.org/DQ_University?actiondiff&version277&version174 An example.
http://daviswiki.org/The_Farmhouse?actionrecall&version2 Another great example, which led to http://daviswiki.org/Mormon_Helping_Hands?actionrecall&version2 this.  (One good edit often leads to another).

 Whos in? 

Lets try to get at least one person for each day of the week, but it would be great to get several; each day there are many updates that could be made.  Users/CovertProfessor Im going to sit back at first and perhaps fill in with a missing day if necessary, but hopefully well get enough volunteers that I can just pick a day of my choice.

Sunday   Users/CovertProfessor
Monday  Users/TomGarberson
Tuesday 
Wednesday  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
Thursday 
Friday 
Saturday

are you kidding? Every day is add content to the wiki day. In fact I regularly yell at people who participate in Drama instead of meaningful edit. I add new content to the wiki whenever I can think of it, or information in the town changes (business etc) Daubert

Dont get me wrong I appreciate the sentiment, but get real
 I think the idea is that a lot of information shows up in local media which doesnt get carried over to here, so having someone actively looking around for things to add would almost certainly bring in more content. tg
 TG is right, and I agree that every day is add content to the wiki day.  This page was inspired by my seeing all sorts of stuff go by in the Enterprise and elsewhere that really should be documented on the wiki, but I cant get to it all.  This would help us miss less of the good stuff, and also, hopefully inspire more meaningful edits and fewer drama edits.  Were on the same page, Daubert.   Users/CovertProfessor
I would concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement Daubert

Id call it a good inspiration so far. tg


BOOM even though TG signed up for Monday I took some initiative and added content.

how you like them apples? Daubert
 Those are awesome apples and a great type of wiki contribution... Ill be honest, though, and say that it wasnt the particular sort of contribution I was trying to promote with this project.  Not that one type of contribution is any better than another  theyre all important.  But as I said, Im particularly trying to promote adding content that appears (and too often disappears) in our local media.  If thats not your cup of tea, but if calling places like Eastlake is, more power to you!  We each contribute in the ways that we think are important.  cp


I should probably mention that the chance of me actually starting tomorrow is totally up to how good the airport wifi is.  I only mention so nobody is disappointed if I miss the first Wednesday right after I signed up.  Incidentally, it might be easier to pick a source to cover and just check it daily.  Just a thought that occurred to consider once we get this rolling.  jw
 Hey, dont let me stop anyone who is inspired!  I suggested once a week because I thought it would be easier.  I read various media sources every day, but I cant always find the time to edit.  But once a day is seven times better than once a week. :)  cp
