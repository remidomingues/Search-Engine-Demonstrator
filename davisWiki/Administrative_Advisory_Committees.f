Administrative Advisory Committees are special units of UC Davis to advise the UCD Administration on many different issues involving students and student life, as well as some committees required for oversight.  Undergraduate students and grad students are needed on most committees, as well as various amounts of faculty, Academic Federation lecturers and campus staff staff.

The Administration has a chance of listening to your opinion if youre on one of these committees.  http://chancellor.ucdavis.edu/aac/ More information is available on the chancellors website on how to participate in these committees.
