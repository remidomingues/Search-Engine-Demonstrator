This is the official account of the wiki Administrator. It is only used when it is absolutely necessary to convey the authority of the wiki:board Wiki Board of Directors and the wiki community. Few people have access to the account, namely wikifounder users/PhilipNeustrom, and it is suggested that all changes made with it be respected with the upmost regard.
