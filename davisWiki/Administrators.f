The Davis Wiki has a few administrators.  Admins can lock pages to prevent and help resolve Edit War edit wars.  Admins can also BannedGroup ban users, which they most of the time will do to those who spam or initiate repeated vandalism against the Wiki.

The Administrators are:
  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Users/PaulIvanov
  Users/JabberWokky
  Users/MikeIvanov
  Users/ZacMorris

All nontrivial administrative actions should be taken with Wiki Community community consensus.



I would recommend that there be some regular, periodic (rather than ondemand) forum for real time discussion among admins with the majority or all participating.  I think it would help with keeping admin philosophies homogeneous (and thus evenhanded) and also elastic over time.  I know Ive pondered about a few things (ethically), and Id be curious as to what other peoples take on the same questions would be.  Id imagine it would be best to figure out after we add admins.

 Wouldnt it be better if admin philosophies were not homogenous? After all, the wiki is everchanging. Im not suggesting that there not be agreement between the admins, simply that new ideas will not be shot down automatically. Users/TusharRawat
   Thats what I meant by elastic over time... that new ideas are discussed to improve things and also to change over time as the Wiki scales up.  Users/JabberWokky jw
    Ok.
