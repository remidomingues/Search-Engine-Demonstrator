20090121 15:21:59 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Management, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I saw your note on the Gnome Wiki and fixed the image for you.  When youre uploading large images you want to be automatically resized, you should add the thumbnail option.  In other words, instead of just {{{Image(Tree.jpg)}}}, you would use {{{Image(Tree.jpg, thumbnail)}}}.  The wiki then automatically resizes the image and makes it so that somebody can view the large image just by clicking on it. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091103 12:30:28 nbsp Language like Layout ideal for roommates who want to split the cost of living by sharing a room sounds like advertising copy, so I restored the advert include. Ill try to get around to assisting with that, though. Users/WilliamLewis

20091103 16:01:20 nbsp How is Adobe at Evergreen any less of an advertisement since I restored the advert include? I cant see any edits to that page other than you removing that include. If you dont want the page to read like an advert, how about you not make edits like http://daviswiki.org/Adobe_at_Evergreen?actiondiff&version2157&version1154 this where you remove useful information like rent and replace natural language with bullet points right out of a glossy flier?
