Adobe at Evergreen is an apartments apartment complex managed by Tandem Properties. It is known for being students studentoriented and modern with suite style floor plans.

Roommate Program
The Adobe management runs a roommate matching program for those desiring singlebedroom leases. It’s actually a three or fourbedroom apartment split into separate leases; that is, each resident get their own individual lease contract to alleviate joint responsibility issues that naturally arise under standard apartment leases. Each bedroom comes with a dressing area, bathroom, sink, microwave, minifridge, and private lock. You share the commons area.

It has been claimed that Adobe has the “Best Roommate Program in Yolo County,” but by http://www.google.com/search?qBest+Roommate+Program+Yolo+County&hlen whom exactly, is unclear. But don’t let the lack of an official Best Roommate Program in Yolo County awarding agency deter you from trying the program;  residents have commented that  the management has some special magic up their sleeves that will match you with the perfect roommates.  Adobe claims to be “the only apartment complex in Davis specifically constructed for a successful and hasslefree roommate program,” which refers to the fact that their floor plans were designed so that each bedroom/dressing area/bathroom is a selfcontained and lockable part of the whole apartment.

Mobility
The complex is approximately 1.5 miles away from the north edge of campus, which translates to about 9–12 minutes by bike or 30–40 minutes on foot. How lucky you get at the Russell Boulevard Russell/Sycamore Lane Sycamore intersection makes more of a difference than Running stop signs ignore red octagons.

For groceries, dining, and other miscellaneous shopping needs, The Marketplace is less than half a mile away. If you prefer Nugget The Nugget over Safeway, thats fine; right outside the apartment complex is the Unitrans P/Q bus line Qline stop (#208), and across the street is the corresponding Pline stop (#199). Both stops, as with most bus stops on Covell Boulevard, are shared with various Yolobus Express routes that will take you to Sacramento, West Sacramento West Sac, Woodland, Winters, and Sacramento International Airport Sacramento Int’l Airport.

The Davis Bike Loop runs around the north and east perimeters of the complex. If you follow the Evergreen Greenbelt south (the path you would take to get to campus), you can walk/bike over the awesome carfree bridge over Highway 113 and arrive at Sycamore Park. Or ignore the bike bridge and keep going to Arroyo Park.

Floor Plans

Upstairs units are carpeted in the common areas with Marmoleum kitchen flooring and a gaspowered fireplace.
Downstairs units have ceramic tiled living rooms and extra special storage nooks.

20090224 15:27:57 nbsp I am no veteran at judging apartments, and I dont think I ever will be one cause Adobe is just that great. I dont plan on moving as long as I have housemates to help foot the rent (were a group of six living in a 4bedroom setup). The only (read: only) thing that would make it perfect is if Unitrans offered a bus line connecting the NW Davis apartments (Adobe, Glacier Point, Willows) to the Silo, as P/Q only goes to MU. Users/HJH

2009224  Anybody has 3bedroom apartment in West Davis and is looking for summer sublet, please let me know.  I may be able to take over your lease and renew for an extra year.  I can be reached at yzhengusc@gmail.com.

20090226 16:14:04 nbsp The parking is too small. Thats the only thing that I can complain about it. :)) Users/IanChau

20090505 19:24:01 nbsp I have lived here 2 years and I love it here. I live close to the pool, and yes, it is kinda loud on weekends. Parking is going to be free next year, which is great, since I had to pay $25 a month for a covered spot last year. It is quite expensive to live here, but if you share a room, its not too bad. They are nice big rooms, I am in a 4x4 that is the handicap room, and the problem with this room is that the one closet has no door. If you share a room, be sure to get the rooms with 2 closets. The fans in the bathrooms are loud, and you cannot turn on the light without turning off the fan, which is a minor complaint, but still irritating.
Also, I heard that my upstairs neighbors have had several noise violations and have been fined over $600 this year. Good, they are loud as f, but it wasnt us who called, so please dont give us dirty looks anymore. Users/SamanthaP


20090815 11:42:00 nbsp Ok, I think time to leave another comment before I am moving out of this place.
Yet, parking is a big big issue, the parking is way too small. I still dont understand why do I have to pay 25 dollars per month for my covered parking spot.
Second, the managements are not nice at all, especially the head of them. So mean, rude, and unprofessional are thing that coming up in my head. I completely agree to Desmond ( I am not a hater), and yes they are rude, fake, and cold face.
Third, if you are taking the bus, it is the worst decision you have ever made because you only have one option P for going to school and one option Q for going back home. (for those who are taking buses only).
Four, it takes you luck to turn on the jacuzzi because sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.
Fifth, for those prospective residents, DONT sign the contract when they rush you because you are their customers, you can always find a better place to live. They need you and your money, you are the one who keep their job.
Finally, I am glad to move out. Users/IanChau

  To turn on the hot tub, you need to turn the dial very slowly. Users/hankim
   Hey guys!  Just to clarify, parking is now FREE at Adobe! (Were so thrilled about this and hope you are too!!)
   Also, Ive noticed a few comments about the hot tub not working so I wanted to explain that to you guys.  Basically, when tenants use the hot tub, they sometimes press the Emergency Shut Off button to turn the bubbles off.  This, unfortunately, shuts off the heat of the hot tub also! Simply pull the button towards you and it will crank back on, or let me know and I will come out and fix it for you!  HAPPY HOTTUBBING, Ill see ya out there!  Users/nikirose

20091019 10:38:59 nbsp For my part as a guest who comes to Adobe, I have had bad experiences with the parking situation. There are only 2 spaces guests can use freely. And while there are plenty of other spaces (not covered) the person who are visiting is required to get a 24 hour pass for you (this comes from management). While I normally wouldnt complain (as I understand that apartments have limited parking space), this policy has been erratic and inconsistent from September through October, which is especially frustrating.
I also rode my motorcycles over, parked in the motorcycle spot next to another bike, and later that night I found that it had been knocked over (the other bike had not). While that may not be Adobes fault (and probably just some idiots), it certainly makes me feel unwelcome and confused as a guest. EDIT I do no think there is any parking near outside Adobe which further complicates driving there. Please correct me if I am wrong. Users/omnipotentdude

  People sometimes park in the suburbs. You have to walk a little though. Users/hankim

   Omnipotentdude,  we sincerely apologize for your troubles parking at the Adobe parking lot.  When was your bike knocked over??  If it happens again, let me know.  We have an onsite manager who inspects the property regularly and we may be able to help you in the future.  Anytime you are having a bad experience, please feel free to come into the office and tell me about it.  Im here to make changes based on resident and their guests suggestions.  Anyways, guests are always welcome to park at Adobe and motorcycles do not need a guest pass.  Although there is no outside parking around the complex, we have developed a Parking Policy that allows for guest parking anywhere in the uncovered parking spots, as long as a 24 hour parking pass is picked up by the resident in advance. (Its easy they just need to come to the office and pick one up.)  Just so Im clear, which parts of the policy have been inconsistent?  Please email me at Nadams@tandemproperties.com, or facebook me at facebook.com/nikkirose710 so that we can clear any confusion.  I hope to hear from you soon regarding your concerns! Sincerely, Nicole Adams (Asst. Manager, Adobe at Evergreen Apartments)

20100121 11:41:54 nbsp It is sad to say that I have recently left Adobe Apartments due to some personal issue.  I wrote on this board previously many months ago addressing how i felt about the property.  I am here again to express how Adobe has transition from then.  I would first like to say that Adobe is probably one of the best properties that you will ever live on because the management is probably the best management you will ever encounter.  Lora the manager is very helpful in many things, she is really an expert in her profession.  The thing i like most about her is that she is very understandable and fun to talk to whenever you want to, but also whenever it comes down to her job, she puts her foot down on it.  I would also like to say the best thing about her is that she is not fake in the way that she would not just say she has your side, or their side, because she really takes no side of anyone which is good because that is what people should do and how her third perspective would help in the matter.  As for Nicole, she is probably the most laid back chilled nice girl you will ever meet.  She is the assistant manager, and lets say she also makes things fun at adobe by constantly updating everyone with news and making adobe a lively place.  Aside from that, the other girls working there as well reflect the same personality.  As for the maintaince guy, Jay, he is probably the best maintence guy you will ever meet.  He is fun to talk to, and he makes you feel welcome. Not only that but if you put in work orders, he will get to it within a day, or if not the next.  Every time i put one in, it was done that day.  Overall about this place is that it is probably one of the best property to live given that the customer service there is great.  Everyone complains about the price and how expensive it is, but trust me its worth it, and if you dont think of it, go to Adobe and tour their models, then go to another property and tour their models, then go back to adobe and you will see what im talking about because its not only about the management, but the rooms are probably the most luxurious throughout Davis.  So give it a try and dont be turned away from the price or negative comments, because you sure wont regret it.  I didnt.  I would like to say i will dearly miss the place, and the management, but they will be there for you.  oldhousemate of apt 104 Users/Apt104

20100121 17:11:56 nbsp Adobe definitely has the best management out of all the apartment complexes in Davis. Theyre very responsible and they really do the best they can. Parking is an issue, but thats simply because itll take money/time to create more spaces.

But, when it comes to roommates not paying rent or litigating residents trying to break out of a lease, management makes sure the problem gets resolved as soon as possible. Trust me, Ive pretty much witnessed these things and current residents should be blessed to have such good management. Users/emme

20100319 17:03:07 nbsp everything they say is a lie... why else are people leaving here? warning to future 109... there are a family upstairs.. seriously.. that women is a bitch she is completely rude and obnoxious.. she came downstairs and knocked on our door at 10pm saying that my housemate was playing loud music and he wasnt and we did not hear shit from him and plus he just got home from work and he works two jobs... she came here and started yelling at him and calling him names..which is completely uncalled for and there are so many kids up there and shes already knocked up.. its like non stop pounding up there. and i pull a lot of all nighters and apparently upstairs like to have sex at 4am, and around 46pm the kids just non stop keep running and running on top of room B so good luck to whoever you are. By the way, every time you leave the apartment and the upstairs are downstairs, they will completely mug at you.

Another thing is parking... because we live in the front by the office its always loud and the trucks are always parked in front of the office and you cannot back out if you are parked in the visitors side. I personally think the managers are rude.. when i went in to ask if my packaged came she was like i dont know? you have to check yourself because we have an open closet thing over there and you just get whats yours and check out over here seriously? apparently this is suppose to be all nice and fancy apartment complex that is super overpriced... apparently they cannot keep track of our packages, it shows how much they get paid to care about their residents. and seriously every single time i go there.. the socalled manager is ALWAYS on facebook.. (seriously if you look up adobe theres always a chick taking myspace angle pictures)that is completely not professional and they are NEVER in the front and always in the back and when they come out.. they give me excuses.. seriously its run by young adults like us and they do not seem to be in the position to manage it.

this places study room is not even open to the residents cause they close it at like 5pm, seriously? everyone has class til night time and no one studies til super late at night who the hell going to use that damn study room because the managers running back there to do whatever they do unlike other apartment complex they are always open to their residents. another thing is your laundry will get stolen so be aware and stay with your laundry. also, in the beginning of the year when we do the walk through, seriously these people do not give a shit about your place cause i told them i had a big sticky dark thing in the room, nope they never came to clean it nor they even ask to clean it. that is the purpose of a security deposit, to come into a clean apartment but they never came around to it. i even took pictures too. seriously this place is a rip off, my friend is also living here but with a 2 bedroom instead of 3 bedroom and we pay about 2300 for a 3 bedroom and he pays 800 for a 2 bedroom, after i found that out i realize how shady this place is and reality this place is a total fake

and to the person whose hella offended cause they move to parkside.. this aint my first apartment complex i lived elsewhere before everyone also feels the same way who live in this apartment complex.. apparently the woman upstairs claim that she never had problems with previous residents who lived in this apt but shes probably lying cause shes probably the reason why everyone left this place, so a recommendation is move southdavis cause its alot better and more college people rather than families

 Users/babykimchii
    Are you sure its not eight hundred for each room? Users/hankim
    Have you talked to anyone about the upstairs neighbors? If not, you really cant blame the management for whatever feud you and they have going...Users/JoePomidor

Hey Babykimchii!

Nicole here from Adobe.  Just was concerned about your experience at Adobe.  :(

Regarding the Packages:  Just to clarify, we do sign for your packages and have a convenient selfcheck out system in the office.  No, we do NOT keep track of your packages (there are almost 500 residents and about 30+ packages delivered a day it would be impossible..) but the company who you purchased your product from should have a tracking number attached to the item.  Contact the delivery service and they will track the package for you. :)

Regarding me being on Facebook all the time (Its true!):  So, Im the Assistant Manager and yes, I am ALWAYS logged into Facebook as I am Facebook Friends with all the Adobe residents.  They are able to contact me via chat/messages throughout the day (and even after hours on my personal time when Im not even paid) to put in maintenance requests, get answers to their questions/etc.  My facebook page is www.facebook.com/AdobeApartments (facebook me if you need to contact me!!!)

Regarding the Clubhouse: the Clubhouse is available afterhours Just ask management and we will give you a key you can have the whole thing to yourself!!  Residents reserve the clubhouse for study sessions, parties, dinners, movie nights, etc.  Let us know if you ever need to reserve it.

Regarding the carpet stain: if something remains in the unit uncleaned after movein, you need to notify management.  We will come by with a professional vendor to clean the stains.

Ok, so our two bedroom is not $800.  Han is right, whoever you were talking to was probably referring to his bedroom,not the full apartment.  Also, our new security system is being installed this Thursday (we will have 2 in each laundry room!)  If any apartment complex rents to just students they are probably in violation of Fair Housing Laws, just FYI.  Stop by the office if you need to place an incident report regarding noise, Ill be here!

Thanks,

Nikki

20101202 13:40:05 nbsp I think they abuse their power and they arent responsive. Dont get on their bad side. Please refer to other websites if you want the unedited version of this comment, as Im unable to post my thoughts fully here. Thanks.  Users/anonpincher

20101207 16:55:48 nbsp This is my first year living in apartments in Davis and Id like to say that I really enjoy living at Adobe, but unfortunately there are many problems Ive had as well:

Pros:
management is nice and helpful
any reported problems are fixed quickly and when you want (they ask you when your available or if they are allowed to enter your apartment if you are unavailable)
the complex is beautiful and the pool and hot tub are very nice
the clubhouse has a great atmosphere and they serve great breakfasts in the mornings during finals week
apartments are very spacious, I live with 6 girls and we havent had any problems with crowding (although the individual rooms are a little small)
the bike path is practically a straight shot to campus and is a gorgeous ride
GREAT location! Campus is only 15 minutes away (on my heavy cruiser) and theres a Safeway, CVS, Coldstone, Big 5, etc. right across the street!

cons:
I live near the bike path on the far side of the complex and Im not sure if its just my location, but the police have been come to our apartment several times asking for random people that we dont know at obnoxious hours in the morning, the police have also visited apartments in our area of the complex quite a few times which makes me nervous about the people who live around me
my roommates and I have had to call the police a few times because we can hear the people living behind us (who we share a wall with) yelling loudly and fighting and banging things about 3 times a month and the people below us are constantly fighting as well. It sounds like there are some abuse issues...
the walls look awful because people will nail things into them and then cover it up with paint and putty and do a sloppy job
the bathrooms have no ventilation aside from a fan in the ceiling so they can get kinda smelly
there arent enough spots to park your bike. at the beginning of the year they tagged all the bikes and took away the ones that didnt get the tags ripped off of them after about a week which helped, but they tried to confiscate my roommates bike even though the tag was ripped off (kind of understandable because its a ragged bike). they were kind enough, however, to buy her a new bike lock after they hacked through the old one.
this probably isnt the complexs fault because Im not sure if they knew this was going to happen, but the bike path is being repoured right now and has been under construction for a while which makes the bike ride annoying and longer because you have to go around it. It would have been nice to have been warned that this was going to happen (but the pro with this is that when theyre finally finished there will be a really nice smooth new path to campus which is much appreciated after the crappy torn up asphalt we had to ride on before)
where are all the students?? again, it might just be that my roommates and I chose to live near a laundry room and bike path rather than the pool, but everyone who lives around us has kids (who they dont seem to watch ever, as they climb all over our porch sometimes). The way they advertised the complex, it seemed like we would be living with many more people our age
the hospital is right down the street, so the ambulance sirens go off constantly

all in all, I would really like Adobe, but the people who live around me constantly yelling and the frequency of the police visiting us has made me extremely uneasy and I dont plan on living here again. Users/HayleyCL

20101207 17:51:29 nbsp Hayleysome questions/comments here since you put in so much info.

1) Bathroom issuebuy a can of Lysoleasy fix
2) Wallsdid you approach Management about getting the walls painted?
3) You choose to live near a hospital? Why is this a CON of the apartment experience when you chose to live there?
4) As to the Police knocking on your door at random times, have you approached them about these intrusions? Document your concern with them.
5) If youre concerned with the abuseagain dont wait until it happens, contact the authorities and log a formal complaint with a written statement. CC that statement to the apartment management. Users/PeterBoulay

20110111 22:12:47 nbsp I really dont have too many bad things to say about Adobe. The kitchen and living room is pretty roomy.. too spacey to do much with it but its nice. There are (relative to other places) a lot of kids living here and yes you can hear them but its not as bad as drunk college kids partying and blasting their music in the middle of the night. So take your pick. But management is great, any maintenance requests get taken care of almost immediately, and at least our apartment is in great condition. Im really only leaving next year because its way too expensive. ($800 for your own room and bathroom.. you might as well just get a studio). I feel like itd be too cramped with two people living in one room.. thats just me though Users/sadiesh774

20110117 23:10:56 nbsp I quite like Adobe, good apartment, pretty quick repairs, close to Safeway, etc etc. Im tempted to not move out, as much as I really want to live in new places in Davis, I feel like I am going to be consistently disappointed. They even have a pretty good roommate program, though be careful that you actually want someone to live with you! Dont force yourself to get along with potential roommates when you first meet them, because if they then decide to live with you, youre stuck pretending youre comfortable around them for a whole year! That was my big mistake, but not Adobes fault.
Good place, I recommend it & will likely stay. Users/Tparkeressig

20110120 13:00:23 nbsp Peter,
Thanks for the questions/comments, Ill do my best to answer them.

1) Although Lysol is an amazing product, it isnt an easy fix. Trust me, it isnt that I dont clean the bathroom enough, but spraying Lysol everywhere would just make it smell worse because the chemical smell will never leave the bathroom without a window nearby. Instead, it would just cause our bedroom and dressing area to smell as well.
                      This response made me realize that I forgot to mention how AMAZING the dressing areas are! Although its been a spacial challenge squeezing two people into one of the bedrooms for a year (tough, but very doable if you like your roommate), the inbetween areas with the closets and sink have been a life saver. There are two bedrooms in the fourbedroom apartments that dont have this luxury, which is kind of odd; but for the ones that do, its been nice to know that I can wake up at any hour without disturbing my roommate by brushing my teeth or getting changed or taking a shower.
2) About the walls They look fine from a distance and have been painted over. Maybe Im just a nitpick, but its when you get about 45 feet away that you start to notice every place thats ever been drilled in the wall and puttied over. But it really isnt so bad if you dont mind some patches; at least everythings the same color.
3) I guess the hospital comment is more of a warning than a con. Be prepared to hear sirens closeup because you will be living between a hospital and an elderly care facility (the apex of ambulances). I dont think its so horrible, personally, because I grew up next to a Childrens Hospital in Oakland, about a block away from the local fire department and down the street from a school. Im used to noise. But for people who arent used to hearing this kind of thing, it might be a makeorbreak point that they hadnt thought about.
4) As for the police and abuse around the complex, Id like to start off saying that we havent been waiting around wondering what to do after hearing something/someone get shoved into a wall, weve called the police a few times. Next time I will take your advice and let the complex know as well though. Im less concerned about the act of the police visiting, however, than what it means. Im more worried for my safety as well as others in the complex. Users/HayleyCL
   Having hung drywall in the past, Im picky about patches as well.  Its a legitimate notice, although youve probably realized (like I have) that some people dont even realize what youre seeing when you look at a wall that has dozens of patched nail holes and dents.  Its worth noting for those of us who do get annoyed by it. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵

20110216 18:11:22 nbsp I have been living at Adobe for 2 years, and I just signed my lease again. ) There are no problems at all that couldnt of been fixed. BUT the only thing I dislike would be the roommates. I live in a studio so there is a roommate program. I loved my past roommates but this year, I cant stand it. And I believe that one of the comments below has complained about yelling loudly and fighting and banging things about 3 times a month and the people below us are constantly fighting as well. I think I got one of those roommates. Because of this, I was contemplating on whether to move out or not. BUT Adobe is too awesome so Im going to stay for another year. Although, I am quite sad because all I hear is loudness.  Users/ICU

20110220 10:29:57 nbsp Adobe is the best apartment complex if you want to save a couple hundred dollars and share a room with someone.  We have 4 girls in a 2 bed/bath apartment and it works out nicely.  The room seems so much bigger compared to other potentially shared rooms because the closets are in the hallway!  I love the vanity in the hallway and the bathrooms are decent sized.  There have been a few occasions where all 4 roommates are talking on the phone or computer and it is easy to not be distracted by the voices (people are located in the rooms, living room, and one hallway with all of the doors shut).  Honestly, I have become a deeper sleeper since living with so many people, but Im okay with that.  We do have loud neighbors and some people like to drive around between 111 on Wed/Thurs nights which is kind of annoying, but they probably arent living at Adobe.

Jay the maintenance worker is wonderful and fixes a repair problem within the day, usually within a few hours.  When our microwave died a month into our lease, he replaced it immediately.  We have a few problems with food storage space and I brought a mini freezer to keep up with our groceries since we all cook, so I dont recommend more than 4 people living in an apartment because even though each room has a fridge.  We leave our cooking pots/pans on top of the mini fridges because there is no space!  I would like a little more counter space too, because there is very little room to prep.

This year we did have the bike path repaved and Adobe was given very little information about the process.  They actually kept calling the city about the bike path and were very upset about their residents having to find a different path to campus.  Im sure the path will be fine for years now, so it doesnt matter.

I also did take about 25 pictures of individual stains and cracks when I moved in and filed the conditions report, but when we put furniture in the stains werent noticeable.

I highly recommend Adobe if you want to feel safe and comfortable in an apartment.  Laura and Nicole are super sweet and have events at the clubhouse every month and have cookies every friday. Users/JulieFeusier

20120130 11:45:54 nbsp Ive lived in adobe apartments for two years, the first year I was talked into it by a friend and the second year was mainly for the convenience of not moving again. If I could have researched apartments more thoroughly I would not have picked adobe. There are way more cons than pros in this complex. The area is nice and surrounded by markets and food places but it is far from campus and downtown Davis. The rooms are big and have personal bathrooms but the prices to live here is ridiculous! We pay over 700 for one room here, which is basically a house payment. A four bedroom is calculated to 2800 not including pg&e or Comcast. Also, my major complaint is parking. You would think paying 700 dollars a month for a room youd have parking spaces convenient for each resident..well that does not apply to adobe. They dont have enough parking spaces and give away covered spots at random which is total bs. They dont tow anyones car so feel free to park here whenever. They send out emails but thats about it. They do not cars about your convenience or safety. Most of the time I have to park in the back parking lot and walk a back trail to get to my apartment. At night the back trails are filled with drunkards and homeless people. Its scary if youre alone, but management does not seem to care if you get assaulted, robbed or raped. The ladies seem nice at first, but the moment you bring up any complaints they are totally rude and disrespectful. What else is there...well the pool is really small, it has a nice canopy area but thats it. They dont have a study area with computers or printers like most apartments do, and wifi sucks in the club house. Oh and beware of having anything shipped here, they dont monitor who takes what, and my roommates and I have had our packages stolen due to their security of items. The gym is really small and stuffy and only has a few machines worth doing. Overall I hate this place. I cant wait to move out to a better place. I wouldnt recommend these apartments to my worst enemy. Please be aware of their false promises to lure you in, do your research and I guarantee you will find a better place!  Users/Agza

20120210 18:04:29 nbsp Adobe is the best apartment complex Ive lived in by far.  The apartments are much newer than a lot of other apartment complexes in Davis.  My apartment was well lit and had nice appliances and a clean bathroom.  The rooms are very spacious and have good noise insulation.  Its close to the Marketplace shopping center and is in close proximity to the freeway, which is convenient.

The management team is very professional, as they always are responsive in getting maintenance requests done on time.  Id say that Adobe understands customer service well, as they will go out of their way to make your experience comfortable.  I definitely recommend living here. Users/DaveG

20120526 16:52:21 nbsp Lived here a couple of years, only stayed past one year because I didnt want to move. Now I wish that I had. Noisy residents that management does little about. Not to mention that they now apparently let residents part their motorcycles on their front porches (hard to be more ghetto) and blast music from them with inappropriate lyrics despite children living in the complex. I would walk around at night in this place. Residents (including the onsite manager) dont even clean up after their dogs. Random cats wander the complex and then try to get into your apartment. This place is going more down hill everyday. Make sure you dont live anywhere near 118 in the complex, worst side to ever be on. No one stays more than a year or two, theres a reason for that. Stay away unless you want to park your motorcycle on your front porch next to your outdoor couch :) Users/elizabeth2014

20120531 13:31:31 nbsp Hi Elizabeth,

Were so sorry to hear you arent satisfied with your experience at Adobe. Please contact me at your earliest convenience so I can ask you a few questions about your complaints. We have community policies in place that can help me address your concerns, but when Im not aware of your problems, I cant help. Even if it is your intent to leave, Id like to know more so I can address these concerns for the Adobe community. Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention.

20120603 10:59:17 nbsp Well, I dont know Elizabeth 2014, but seriously you clearly have no idea what bad apartments are. I have lived all around the greater Sacramento area, and Adobe is by far the best I have ever stayed in. Its clean and the management are always helpful, which is something I dont want to go unrecognized. Having people in the office, not to mention the grounds keepers, that are always nice, and willing to talk with you is something this is really hard to find. I had a motorcycle parked out front of my place for a couple of weeks until I could afford to have mine lo jacked, but I talked with management first. Now I park mine in the designated area. I long board through here often and I have not seen these alleged dog landmines, probably because there is a no dog policy enforced here unless its for assistance. Cats, well, having lived in a few places in Davis, thats a Davis thing. I dont know why, perhaps the city of Davis likes the idea of cats roaming the streets in hoards. These perceived plights by the previous poster are ridiculous. I live near the pool and people have parties most weekends, but seriously even when they have it loud, its not bad at all. I am 4.0 student at UCD and I have had to study on weekends when there was a lot of activity around the pool. My window faces the pool, but they have really good insulation or something because it was hardly audible. Oh and there is a reason why residents on average stay here only two years, but its really nothing nefarious, its a college town. Meaning if you come here freshman year, you are required to stay in the dorms, after that you are free to move wherever. Now, most sophomores, are still nostalgic of the dorm days (I have no idea why), and try and get a place on the fringes of campus. After the sophomore year, people realize they need to get down to business which means cheaper rent and a more peaceful end of town. Hence, that is why I came to Adobe and I dont regret it.  Again, you want bad, I dare you to move out of Adobe and then you will see how good you had it. Specifically, Laura is probably the greatest apartment manager ever. If you have problems, why dont you actually try asking the people next to you to keep it down if you are so annoyed by it. The nice thing about Davis, and Adobe in particular, is everyone is likes hanging out. So instead of making a laundry list of annoyances, try engaging you neighbors.. or you can talk to the management. Users/BrettBeyler

20120710 12:07:56 nbsp Worst Place I have Ever Lived.
I found out about Adobe and its roommate matching program my Softmore year. It seemed easier than searching around on craigslist so I signed up. I moved in from Europe and everything seemed fine until my roommates began to harass and threaten me. I was not allowed to bring my girlfriend into the house as my lesbian seemed to frighten them. I went to management and asked if I could possibly move to a different handicapped accessible room. I was not accustomed to dealing with drastic homophobia at such a close range. My roommates seemed to genuinely hate me because of my sexuality. I had to call the police three times during the five months I lived at Adobe. UC Davis victims service workers and the police all told me the same thing, “talk to management and find a way out, this is not a healthy situation.” At least three times a week I would go into the management office after being confronted with another roommate situation which could be solved by me moving. My roommates would change the locks when I went to school, leaving me unable to enter the house, enter my room and yell at me when I in bed, strange things like that. I would stay in my room with my door locked whenever I was in the apartment; the kitchen “communal space” was not open to me. The stand in manager was extremely unhelpful and she directed the front desk workers to bring my problems to her, which she would then dismiss. Even my emailed police reports would not be replied to.
After the third time of calling the cops, I could not live with people calling me a dyke instead of my actual name. I moved out into a house with new awesome roommates who accept my sexuality. Adobe would not let me break the lease, move into one of their other properties and switch my lease, and I felt I had no other choice. Because I am a student and do not need bad credit I have been paying the 790 dollars a month for rent there, as well as the apartment rent I pay now. This amounts to about 1,400 dollars a month in rent. I have been paying the rent on an apartment I don’t even have the keys to for five months now.
I do not have this kind of money and am going slowly but surely into debt. I never felt as hopeless or depressed as when I went into the manager’s office after being harassed due to my sexuality and she told me, “maybe you should just learn how to get along with your roommates.”
 Users/KatelynRingrose

20120711 20:30:52 nbsp I am simply addressing the grievances of Katelyn Ringrose so as to not allow such slander towards Adobe as well as myself to influence those who read comments of disgruntled ex tenants. Each and every remark she has so insidiously made concerning her stay at Adobe at Evergreen is completely false with absolutely no evidence to back up her outlandish claims. Addressing each of her points, I will explain the truth behind each and every statement. But first I must give a small background on what type of person Katelyn is. We own everything in the kitchen, including pots, pans, kitchen table, and kitchen ware. She used all of our stuff without ever cleaning up after herself. It was so bad that some of our pots would grow mold after being left out with half eaten pasta in it for a week or more. She had a kitten that she treated miserably. That kitten had no toys, no scratching post, forcing the kitten to scratch our furniture. She never took out the litter, to the point that when she went away for winter break, she left a litter box filled with 6+ weeks of cat feces to fester for an additional month in our apartment. This extreme health violation that clearly endangered our safety, forced management to intervene in not allowing the kitten to continue living in the apartment. During the time that the kitten did live there, she would lock her out of her room where the litter was for whole days, forcing the kitten to urinate all over our couch blankets because she had no where else to go. When the door was open the kitten refused to use the litter for good reason and would urinate over all her clothes instead. She had her mother come down every so often to do all her laundry, clean the litter, and clean her room. While her mother did this, we would listen to Katelyn berate her if her mother ever asked her to help. She is simply a child that is not used to living on her own as an adult.

    Her first claim that her roommates (I.E. myself and my girlfriend) harassed and threatened her are the exact claims that we had to file with management within the second month of living with her. One day we came home from a weekend visiting family to find our whole apartment trashed and the kitchen unusable, the following day I proceeded to ask Katelyn when she was going to clean up her mess so that we could use the kitchen. This single question incited her to hoarsely scream at me, threatening me if I ever asked her to do anything again. These verbal threats and blatant harassment and disrespect for us as well as all of our property she felt she had the right to defile is what led us to contact management the first time, filing a report in the process.

      She brings up her sexuality several times in her comment and I feel it pertinent to not only address the reality of these remarks but also the views of myself, my girlfriend, as well as Adobes. We never once called her a dyke, nor did we reference her as being a dyke. Both my girlfriend and myself have some very, very close friends who are gay and we support them in any way that we can. Adobe is extremely gay friendly and has a very, VERY strict hate crime policy that extends to homosexuals. If we were aggressive towards her sexuality we would have been evicted. Now to the truth of what she is saying. She had brought over several girls and guys to the apartment. There was only one instance in which we even acknowledged her date by saying that we were going out and we were going to be right back and so as to not hook up right on the couch because it may be awkward for her date or herself. The only other instance involving any sort of sexual matter would have been when we asked her to stop leaving her dirty underwear in the communal room and to please not leave her butt plug on the couch for us to have to deal with. Other than that, no sexual remarks were ever made. Her blatant slander of our character as well as Adobes is extremely offensive and only shows the true character of the individual writing them.

    Concerning the constant police interaction: all of it is false yet again. She has never filed a single police report, nor have we ever been contacted by the police nor have they ever intervened seeing as there would be nothing that would require intervention on her part. She states that she hid in her room never being in the kitchen and locking her bedroom door. Well this, again, is a lie, seeing as this is exactly what we ended up doing after the harassment reached frightening heights. Katelyn would constantly throw unannounced parties that involved underage drinking and illegal drug use. They would break and damage our property seeing as we owned every single item in the kitchen. They would also be up till 3 AM+, not allowing us to sleep ever. So, no, it was not her that would be denied the communal space, it was us. We have, again, plenty of reports of Katelyns illegal actions and violations on file at the office to back up my claims, while she has absolutely none. Finally, us changing the locks on her when she left (again false) has a very funny anecdote. Katelyn would never once lock the front door upon entering or leaving the apartment. We asked her a hundred times to do so, in which she would just stare us down and ignore us. Management made it clear that her actions were endangering our safety and had to stop. She still did not. Towards the end, before she finally left, she left the apartment, again unlocked, so that night I locked it before going to bed and she had not brought her keys with her. Because of this she couldnt get into the house. We refused to let her in because we were fed up with her and we owed her no kindness at this point. So she set out there for 3 hours banging on the doors and windows, disrupting the neighbors, till the police came. The next day we went to the office and management made it clear that we did not have to do anything for her; that she had to be responsible. She moved out within the week. But, her statement that we changed the locks on her is false because that is not only illegal to do, but would never have been tolerated by management.

  Adobe has been nothing but accommodating to our needs and problems with Katelyn. Not only were they understanding to our needs, but they were to hers as well. They offered to move her to another apartment, but she refused, saying that she was not the problem. Her claim that they would not move her to another handicapped room is true only because there were none available, but seeing as she is not handicapped and does not require one, this is rather a moot point. If you are interested in living in an apartment complex with mostly adults and families that are relatively quiet, clean, and considerate, Adobe is just that. We have met with many other residents and they very mature and responsible. Even our random subletter who took over Katelyns month to month rent was a great guy who we were glad to get to know. There are the occasional rotten apples, but you cannot lay any sort of blame on the management for such problems and, if anything, her leaving shows that such individuals do not have a place at Adobe for very long. I hope readers will take all of these negative comments with a grain of salt and understand that the writers behind these criticisms have their own issues that they feel are not their problems, but rather Adobe and everyone elses.

Dear Katelyn and Cheschirmer,

While the roommate program works well for most of our residents who select that option, it is not always error proof. Adobe has a 10 year history of working hard to find the best fit for our households and when circumstances beyond management’s control leave one or more of our residents unhappy, we are equally frustrated and disappointed with the situation. We work to remain neutral in these disputes and always do our best to help roommates reach a resolution. When a resolution is not possible, the Davis Model Lease (drafted by UCD students and voluntarily used by Tandem Properties) guarantees a resident’s right to sublease his/her space. In particularly contentious roommate disputes, like yours, we even go a step beyond the sublease option and offer comparable alternative accommodations. Katelyn, as you chose not to take the room in another apartment, we continue to be willing to work with you to sublease your room here at Adobe. I am genuinely sorry to hear of your continued frustrations. If you need more resources or help with finding someone to take over the remainder of your lease, please call the office and I’m happy to set up an appointment to help you in any way that I can.

Warm Regards,
Laura Sutton
Residential Manager

20120727 14:13:26 nbsp This makes me seriously sick. I have never been so disgusted in my entire life. I have records on file from the Davis Police Station, Davis Victims Services and Incoming and Outgoing messages from Adobe.

At various times, I requested to be switched to any other handicap accessible room either in Adobe or elsewhere. Management never once tried to remedy the situation. ROOMMATE MATCHING? This can not be serious. I am not a disgusting person. I cant believe that this was allowed to go on. I STILL PAY RENT THERE, I havent lived in that apartment for seven months now. How is this even possible?

I just wanted to tell future students that this was not a healthy situation and to be careful of roommate matching places like this, that dont care if you wind up with homophobic and abusive people. I am literally shaking I am so upset.


And yes Che, in case you were wondering I DO ENJOY WEARING a butt plug. It just isnt left laying around.

And Here is a Copy of the Email I sent the Owner. Before deciding to leave.
Katelyn Ringrose

Email to the owner

John Whitcombe,
My name is Katelyn Ringrose. I am an undergraduate at UC Davis. I am a resident of one of the Tandem Property’s, Adobe at Evergreen. Since moving in I have undergone severe stress due to my separate lease, “roommate program” matched roommates. I have searched for someone to take over or sublease my room but have had no interest in the apartment.
 I am using this email as a way to open discourse about this problem. I feel very unsafe in my apartment and have had to contact the police twice during the school year. I feel that my rights to equal housing have been violated and my situation is unlivable. I was told Lara, the apartment manager, contacted you and was told I was not to be let out of my lease.
I would very much like support on leaving Adobe and/or filling my room.
Katelyn Ringrose

Log of Incidences

To Whom it May Concern:
This is a list of concerns I have regarding what I believe to be a situation that is unlivable.

#1 The Apartment Manager signed my lease allowing that I would live in Apartment 139B with one other (preferably male roommate). The roommate agreement led me to believe my roommate would be a single person. I agreed to have two people with the verbal agreement from Adobe management that utility’s would be split equally between the occupants.

#2 After moving in to the apartment I was presented with the first PG&E bill. I went to the office to pay my 1/3 when I was told my roommates paid only ½. I received no support from management on this issue and was instead told that because this situation had never occurred in the roommate program and that I needed to deal with it myself.

#3 This problem caused a lot of stress in the apartment and my roommates finally agreed to pay their 2/3 of the electricity only after I had paid ½ the first month. I never received a return on this money and truly cannot afford to money.

#4 My roommate’s requested a room switch with me as they perceive my room as being larger. I signed the lease months before them and had my room assignment in the lease. Management did not back me in this issue and I was forced to deal with the legality’s on my own. I have rheumatoid arthritis as well as back issues (arthritis and cracked disks) I specifically requested this room for its walk in shower that is easier for me to use than a tub.

#5 After these initial issues my roommate’s became incredibly hostile and verbally abusive. I approached management with these issues and was not given any resources to deal with these issues. I called the police on () and was put in touch with a deputy who advised me to keep a log of all the issues that result in my condition being unlivable.

#6 Under California State Fair Housing Guidelines
California state fair housing guidelines in which certain classes are protected, including: race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, disability, and source of income.

My roommate’s have repeatedly engaged in bullying behavior and harassment concerning my sexual orientation.
I do not find hurtful words like, “dyke” or “buttbuddyys” acceptable, when applied to me or members of the community.  I feel uncomfortable coming home from dates to questions like, “did you scissor?” I don’t feel comfortable in these situations and feel that my roommates as well as management violate equal housing laws when ignoring this behavior towards my sexuality, a thing over which I have no control.

I believed that I would have a safe place to live for the 20112012 school year. After this harassment I spoke to management and was not allowed out of my lease. I feel threated when I hear hate directed at me because of my sexual orientation and I do not appreciate management’s nonresponse.

#7 On 10/17/2011, I went to the Health and Wellness Center at UC Davis, I was diagnosed with extreme stress leading to depression and was advised to neglect all activity’s leading to my stress. This is when I began to try and find a different way out of my hostile living arrangements.
The next night after I went to the Health and Wellness center, my roommate’s approached me about dishes in the sink. He stood over me and screamed in an extremely threatening manner. I felt frightened and went to stay with family for a few days.

#8 1/11/2012, I stepped out of my apartment for an hour. When I came back I had been locked out. My roommate’s were inside but would not open the door. I knocked and they did hear me but I was forced to sleep at a friend’s house. I was locked out and because of my sexual orientation and other issues, my roommate’s created such a hostile environment I was forced to sleep elsewhere.

#9 3/1/2012, I accidentally left my keys in the apartment before going to school. I came home at 9:00 PM and found the door locked. I was polite knocking on the door trying to get in the apartment, it was cold and I was unable to get into the apartment. My roommate’s were in their room and I could hear them. To tune out my requests to open the door they simply turned the volume up on their television. On the advice of an upstairs neighbor, Monica, I called the UC Davis Police. The deputy arrived and requested that my roommates open the door around 11:30.

This sort of emotional bullying feels threatening to the point where I do not feel safe in the apartment.

#9 Starting the day of move in September 1st, I had entered into a verbal agreement with my roommate’s concerning Internet. I paid my bill forward halfway and into February I realized my internet was down. I was highly confused as I had homework to do. When my roommate’s came home I asked them if the internet was down. My roommate (Che) threw the next month’s cash I paid (15$) at me and told me the internet was in his name. I was given no explanation

#10 I came home to find a notice posted on my door that my small cat was posing a problem for my roommate’s and needed to be confined to my room. Paying half of the rent as well and paying a 400 cat deposit still did not guarantee my cat living room access.

#11 I was under great duress because of all this stress surrounding my living situation and it took me weeks to arrange my own internet. On average students in Davis pay 30 dollars each, each month for internet. In March 2012, I was forced to pay a bill of 193 dollars to pay for internet.

While Adobe’s lease allows its residents to Internet access, I went without an internet outlet for weeks because my roommate’s were using the common outlet located in the living room. I had the internet router and paid for two weeks of internet before anyone from Comcast could come to install a cord splitter allowing me to use the guaranteed internet.

I paid for the installation of the splitter myself and although I was promised by Lara, the apartment manager, to be reimbursed I still have not been.


I am requesting to be let out of my lease as soon as possible to stop any further emotional duress. I would like to be reimbursed for my Pet Deposit (400$), My initial deposit (700$), The installation fee for the splitter (30$).

 I have been advised by the UC Davis Police Department, Counseling and Psychological Services at UC Davis and Victim Services to leave this unhealthy situation immediately.

Adbobe, this situation escalated out of control and I received no help from anyone. As a business that caters primarily to students you lack of empathy makes me sick. I am in no way going to stand by while you lie about your actions.

No Queer Freshman is going to undergo the same stress that I did, this is ridiculous!

20120813 00:35:58 nbsp Though one of the pricier places to live in Davis, the apartments are designed to give you a studio type of living arrangement. In each room, you get your own bathroom, huge walk in closet and a minifridge. When I was living here (20082009), the management worked swiftly and happily catered to our needs. Along with that, they often gave me access to the pool house, which was nice of them. The complex also gives you a pool/jacuzzi, laundry room, two or three parking spaces depending on your housemate situation, several BBQ areas, and a beautiful bike path that takes you towards campus.  Users/Davekhuh

20120914 16:07:15 nbsp Lived here for a few years and was pretty happy with the place. Buildings were nice and the management and even employees managed to know me by name even though I spent most of my time at school and work while locking myself up in my room the rest of the time. Only cons would be there can be some noisy kids playing around the complex during the day time and some of the college students that live here can be really loud at night. Also, the laundry room on the east side tends to be a mess most of the time (the west side seems to be cleaner). Would live there again / 10. Users/hankim

20130111 17:50:16 nbsp I would really appreciate if you guys could keep your office hours. As unhelpful as they are. Thursday (1/10/13) you guys left early when my package was delivered and I got out early so I could pick it up. Thanks for that. No explanation. Lets move on to today where I just managed to make it to the office a few minutes before 5:30 and... guess what?! You guys left early! Now lets move on to Saturday where you guys dont open until 10am, I have to be on campus by then. And on the website it, very uinhelpfully, states that you guys close at 5pm but on until Sept. 8th. Thanks for that too. I have no IDEA when you guys close on Sat. but its probably rediculously early and then I will miss then too. And you are closed Sundays. SO lets sum this up, I should have recieved a package on Thursday. However, through no fault of my own, I have to wait until Monday to recieve my package. If I can even get home early enough then. Fantastic. Thank you. You might as well keep my package. Give it to your family because God knows Im never going to get it. Users/AngieLiu

 Hi AngieLiu, Im so sorry we missed you. Our current residents are always our biggest priority and while we do our best to keep one of us in the office when we can, a shortage of available staff this week meant we had to close a few minutes early. If this happens to you again, please just call our office and let us know. We understand that it can be hard for some of you to make our office hours and we are always happy to leave your package in your apartment for you with your permission. I apologize for the inconvenience this caused you. Take care.
 Laura, Residential Manager

20130215 16:21:43 nbsp Ive lived here almost a year and I have had a generally positive experience. First of all, the apartments are very nice, very up to date, and I have not had any issues with appliances or anything of that nature. The rooms are spacious and have nice sized closets. The complex is a little far from campus but it is also right down the street from safeway which is very nice. There are several families that live here and they have kids and sometimes that can be annoying because they run around and make noise. The walls are also quite thin. I can hear my neighbors walking all the time. If you dont mind the price or a little bit of noise, Adobe is a good place to live. The staff and maintenance people are very nice and very helpful.   Users/eddiegreenman

20130904 21:41:49 nbsp Best apartments in Davis! So beautiful that none of my friends or relatives could believe it was a college apartment! The layout makes it absolutely perfect for roommates  everyone has their own key, bedroom, bathroom, and dressing area. Its also a great place for families bc it doesnt get super wild and crazy (always a plus to be able to sleep without worrying about noise!). Its also right next to a shopping center which is so convenient.
Parking is not a problem at Adobe like it is at many other apartments in Davis. If you have a car, its really nice to know that parking wont be an issue, and no one will steal your spot (and if someone does, the office staff literally gets them out in seconds).
Most impressive of all, though, is the staff. They create such a sense of community, and are always there for each and every resident. Shari Houston, who oversees all of Tandem Properties, really goes above and beyond with the apartment complexes, making sure every resident is happy. Its easy to see why Adobe is the most highly rated apartments in Davis! So glad I stayed here, and Im so sad to be leaving! Users/HeatherStanis

20140319 16:54:59 nbsp I have lived here since Fall 2012, and have to leave now (not because of management). Ive been happy here. The place is new (built in 2000), quiet, and spacious. Price isnt bad, if you dont mind sharing a room. Management is very responsive  Ive put in repair requests and never had to wait more than an hour to get them fixed. They have a dedicated management staff with two maintenance men on duty at all times. Multiple laundry facilities with plenty of washers and dryers. Right on a bike path and the P/Q line (also close to Yolobus 42A/B and 220), so its easy to get to campus within 15 minutes. Close to restaurants and the Marketplace as well. If youre considering living here, go for it! Users/chandru

20140529 02:03:12 nbsp Oh, how Ill miss this place.

I have nearly no complaints about Adobe and it has set my expectations for future dwellings so high, Im not sure if Ill be this impressed again! I lived here my sophmore year (20132014) and honestly enjoyed every moment of it. Its always quiet since they take noise very seriously at this complex... plus, a lot of families live here. The worst youll hear is a child here and there screaming but it honestly doesnt get that bad (unless you really REALLY hate kids). Management is always prompt with any issue you bring up to them, often sending maintenance within thirty minutes to an hour after getting your request. The complex is about a fifteen minute bike ride to campus and is two or so blocks away from a marketplace containing Safeway, CVS, Petco, Togos, Dos Coyotes and more. Oh and youre also connected to two beautiful parks if youre the kind that loves lazy Sunday strolls.

I only had three relatively minor issues with the place though, the last of which is causing us to move. First, Adobe is smackdab in the middle of all kinds of wildlife (granted, this is Davis) and has a giant open backyard for the apartments on one side of the complex. So we had a few pest problems (nothing bigger than insects, thank god) here and there, but thankfully management was prompt and quick to respond to any complaints. Second, as you can see from other comments on the Wiki, parking isnt that great. Its covered and management will make sure that no one ever takes your spot, but if you get a tight one like we did, itll suck trying to maneuver your car into the damn thing! And lastly, and most unfortunate of all, Adobe is expensive. Its an excellent, newer complex, so its understandable, but even when you share a bedroom with a roommate, its quite a lot. A bit too much for our household, unfortunately, so we packed our things and said goodbye. Ill miss this place a lot!

All of that being said, would I recommend Adobe to others? Totally. If you can afford it, Id definitely recommend living here. You wont regret it! Users/MaiT

20140802 18:06:35 nbsp My major issue with Adobe so far is the way they manage the mail that residents receive. The only hours that it is possible to pick up packages is 95, Monday through Friday. I work and take classes Mondays through Fridays from 95! In addition, the management has no system to notify residents if mail has arrived for them (unless it has been there one week plus, in which case they will leave a message in your mailbox). This is a real pain in the neck when ordering textbooks, or other materials that students need as soon as possible. Rushing home so that I can be there before the office closesonly to find that my time has been wasted and my package hasnt arrivedgets old quick. A simple email system would be awesome, but right now the managements method is complete chaos. Amazon 2 day shipping is essentially worthless when dealing with Adobe because the management does not take their residents deliveries seriously.  Users/tomhallward

20140805 16:09:52 nbsp Hi Tom,

Im so sorry to hear about your frustration with packages. If you ever want to call the office to check, we are happy to look for your package and leave it in your apartment for you with your permission. As for notifications, mail carriers are required to leave a notice for each package either on your front door or on your mailbox. If thats not happening, lets work together to get that fixed for you! Please let me know which carrier was involved and Im happy to chat with them when they are in the office. Id also encourage you to call the specific carrier and report the incident with the tracking number involved. Let me know how that goes and what else I can do to help. I will be looking into ways to make our courtesy package pickup more convenient for all residents, so thanks so much for your feedback!  If you want to visit us in the office to offer any suggestions, wed love to chit chat!
