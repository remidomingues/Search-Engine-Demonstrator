Free Kittens
Posted: July 4, 2011, by Users/lhomec Laura

A stray cat had kittens in our garage, we are trying to find them homes. Keep in mind that they are/were feral kittens, so they are a little more skittish than normal, and need to be socialized more than usual. I dont know how old they are, but I would guess about 8 weeks.

Lila: (female)
Quite mellow and enjoys sleeping and being held upside down in your hands. Tendency to hiss.


Ashly: (female)
Playful with a loud purr, but a little skittish at times.


Tyrion: (male)
Playful and the least shy of all the kittens. Will hiss at times.


We have videos of them too!

 Jack, the Ocicat 
Posted: May 19, 2008, by Users/CarlMcCabe Carl
Jack is a smart, affectionate and very loving exotic cat who currently lives in Sacramento.  He is up to date on all shots and is fixed.  Unfortunately, he doesnt get along with other cats.  He needs to be an only.   He adores humans, though and loves attention.  He puts his big paws on your shoulders and buries his head in your neck and purrs when you carry him.   Everyone his current owner knows whos met him (with the exception of other cats) loves him.  He loves to sleep next to someone and when the current owner pats her knee, he jumps up and curls up on her lap.  She would absolutely keep him if she could, but her other 2 cats are living in terror.  To learn more about ocicats, http://www.cfainc.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/Ocicat.aspx see here.
