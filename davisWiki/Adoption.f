Adoption Support Group.  Call Karla Mahoney at (530) 7921871 or email: taclobangirl@yahoo.com

A place where adoptive parents  who have adopted domestically or internationally support each other in regards to the unique issues, challenges, and rewards of adoption.   Children can play and form friendships with one another.  We meet every Saturday of each month at 10:30 am.  Meeting place varies.

Can we actually get some information about this group, or other adoption resources? Users/BrentLaabs
