20110403 20:22:44 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Ive never done more than a few minutes of slacklining, but you sometimes see people with a setup outside Outdoor Adventures (on campus).  Thatd probably be your best bet.  Or, you could swing by Rocknasium and see if theres anyone there in there know (there probably is). Users/TomGarberson

20110403 20:33:58 nbsp When my friends came up, they found a good place to set up a line in Oxford Circle Park. I also bike by Sycamore Park a lot and see a few conveniently located trees for setting up a line as well. Pretty sure plenty of other parks in the area have a good place to set up a line though.
