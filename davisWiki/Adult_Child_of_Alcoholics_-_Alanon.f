AlAnon Adult Child of Alcoholics Meeting

Davis Community Church

412 C Street, Preschool Wing
Davis, CA 95616


Sunday evenings from 5:00pm  6:00pm<

The AlAnon Adult Children of Alcoholics support group meetings are part of the AlAnon Davis AlAnon Family Group; as such, we follow the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AlAnon with a focus on recovering from the effects of having grown up with Alcoholism in our lives.  In adherence to the AlAnon Traditions our groups are Anonymous and the only requirement for membership is that there be a problem of alcoholism in a relative or friend.  Additional information about AlAnon may be found here: http://www.alanon.alateen.org// Alanon/Alateen .

You can find the full Davis AlAnon Family Groups Meeting Schedule at AlAnon Davis AFG.

Come join us, sharing in our experience, strength and hope!

Davis Community Church is a large complex and, while we do put out signs, sometimes it can take a few minutes to locate the rooms.  A map of Davis Community Church can be found here: File(Davis Community Church Map.pdf). While the church address is on C Street, it is usually easier to access the meeting rooms from D street, between 4th and 5th.
