The Adventist Christian Fellowship, Davis (ACF) is an on campus ministry at UC Davis. We meet every Wednesday at 7 p.m. when school is in session. The goal of ACF is to create a friendly open environment where students and community members can come to fellowship with and support one another as brothers and sisters in Christ. Members take turns leading the group in fellowship often through Bible study or multimedia presentations, followed by prayer and discussion. At the end of meetings, we usually have free food and snacks to enjoy.

Join us for:
