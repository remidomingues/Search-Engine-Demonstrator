Youre in Davis. Its the weekend. OR maybe its not. But regardless youre bored and youre tired and want to get out of Davis.  But where can you go and how long will it take to get there?  The destinations are broken down by approximate driving time if you drive without stopping (or traffic slowdown) and at the posted speed limit.

Also see Outdoor Activities and follow some links or check out Hiking and Backpacking for lots of wilderness destination leads. The Northern California page contains a lot of information also. UC Davis UCD students interested in archaeology and outdoor activities might consider the field schools offered by the Anthropology department.  And dont forget about Beaches, although some particular ones are listed below.

If you require something more linear, see Interstate 80 I80 cartrips (Idiot proof trips).

For trips inside California, you can check road conditions on the http://www.dot.ca.gov/ Department of Transportation Website or visit the website http://www.trafficreport.com/ TrafficReport.com to obtain traffic information for areas in California.

     Technically they still do, but no one does anything with it Users/MichelleAccurso

 Adventuring Tips 

 If driving somewhere far like Las Vegas, consider car rental renting a car, especially if you have a gas guzzler.  With rental car rates as low as $1020/day, sometimes this is a net cost savings when you can get a car with 3545mpg.  Plus you spare your car the added mileage.
   Of course, if youre not at least 25, several companies will not rent to you, while others will charge you an outrageous fee.
 Be sure to bring one or many coadventurers.  If none of your friends share your wanderlust, perhaps the Ride Board can hook you up.
  AAA is your friend. In addition to towing, lockout and fuel delivery services, they also can make road trip calamities better. If your car breaks down, many AAA memberships will pay for your hotel and food costs while your vehicle is being fixed or, alternatively, your return transportation (either air, bus, train or rental car). Keep in mind, however, that the AAA frequently advocates against bicyclefriendly laws and infrastructure when there is no benefit to automobiles. A more bicyclefriendly alternative is http://www.betterworldclub.com/ The Better World Club.
 Dont forget your cell phone charger.  And dont expect your cell phone to work in the middle of Nevada.
 The Davis Travelaires lead trips that can help get you comfortable and excited about travel.
 Note: If you are driving through LA on the I5, remember that the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapevine%2C_California Grapevine can be tricky for older cars to navigate smoothly, and that downtown LA traffic is not your friend.
