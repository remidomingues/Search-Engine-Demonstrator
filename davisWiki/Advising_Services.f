Advising Services is a division of Student Affairs that provides a wide range of services for all UC Davis students. AS coordinates wellknown programs for new students like UC Davis Orientation (formerly Summer Advising) and Fall Welcome.

Confusingly, Advising Services as a department is located in two similarly named buildings which happen to be on opposite sides of the main Campus campus.


160 South Silo houses all PreProfessional school advising. Professional schools include: Business, PreLaw Advising Law, and Health Sciences (Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry, Nursing, etc.). At South Silo one can find peer and professional advisers who can facilitate navigation through the application and preparation processes for any of these future career paths.

South Silo also houses PLS, the Professional Letter Service here, however its use is limited to certain fields, so one should check out the website for more details. PHPAC, the PreHealth Professions Advisory Committee letter service no longer exists.


South Hall houses The First Resort, a general academic advising outpost, as well as PreGraduate school (Masters, PhD) and PreTeaching credential advising. One should check out the website for an updated calendar of PreGraduate and Teaching workshops.

South Hall used to house the Graduate Letter Service which, like PLS now, would store letters of recommendation from professors and mail them out to requested schools as one applies. However, GLS is no longer accepting new files. Only active files for those whose GLS file has not yet expired are still able to be used.
