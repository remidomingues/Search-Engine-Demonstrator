Aerobrick is one of the many  student engineering groups in the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Department. Started in 1994 by Professor SarigulKlijn with six students, Aerobrick has grown over the years to encompass three classes that include Regular, Unlimited, and Micro. Aerobrick is understood to refer to the Regular class. Aerobrick students compete every year in Aero Design West, a nationwide competition held by http://www.sae.org/servlets/index SAE. The team is formed each fall and team members  get hands on experience in structural dynamics and aeroelasticity, aerodynamics, propulsion, stability and control, and performance as they design, build and test their aircraft. Aerobrick planes are generally made out of carbon fiber, kevlar, fiberglass and other composite materials.
