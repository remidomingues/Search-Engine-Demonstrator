This is a toy, book, and game store focusing on natural and Davis Waldorf School Waldorfinspired products encouraging childrens natural creativity and imagination.

As of August 2007, this store has closed its doors. No note on the door sheds any light as to its closing, but the room is empty of all inventory. The space has been the site of at least three games/toy stores in the past: The Game Preserve (Derrick Bang), The End Zone (run by Vincentor Ian?) where kids/adults could buy and play card games like Magic, and now Aesops. Sad.


Recently I went in to buy a gift for my nephew and ended up with an awesome set of Anker architecture blocks as well as some interesting logic puzzles. I noticed a cool collection of math and science toys happening.  DavidPonce

20070821 21:36:45 nbsp Aesops Room was having hard times due to a slow economy, and the owners couldnt keep it going as a storefront business.  It is still open as an internetbased toy store, http://www.aesopsroom.com .  Sad to see it go.  Rememberif you value your downtown shops, make sure you buy stuff from them!   Users/TedBuehler

20090826 21:36:45 nbsp I was the original creator and owner of Aesops Room. Having began, grown and operated it for about seven years at that point, I was ready to move on. After approximately a year under new ownership, it was disheartening to see Aesops close. This was the second business I have sold, the first still alive and thriving. I now dedicate myself to helping others grow their business and meet their goals through http://lifecompassnow.com Coaching and http://carmenisais.com Business Consultation.  Users/Cisais
