Affordable Housing is a legal provision that offers lowincome renters housing at a lower cost than renters in higher income brackets.

There are several levels of affordable housing. Qualifying for affordable housing depends on the number of people in the household, the total household income, and the Yolo County area median income. In 2008, the median Yolo County household income was $71,000. Here is the breakdown for number of people in a household and income category (from the http://cityofdavis.org/housing/affordable/pdfs/2008stateincomelevelsforyolocounty.pdf City of Davis website):


Apartment complexes offer different types of affordable housing based on the above categories. Some complexes will only offer affordable housing units while others offer a mixture of affordable housing and regular units. Usually a household will only qualify for affordable housing if one or two of the leasers are working fulltime. This means most Students student apartments wont qualify. Many complexes are a part of Community Housing Opportunities Corporation (CHOC) but not all.

Affordable housing units are often offered under monthtomonth rental agreement monthtomonth leases instead of the September  August lease offered by the Davis Model Lease.
