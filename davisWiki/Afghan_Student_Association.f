The http://home.comcast.net/~ucdasa/ Afghan Student Association (ASA) intends to promote awareness, tolerance, and peace in issues relating to Afghanistan in UC Davis and the surrounding communities. In light of current events, the ASA also intends to address the average Americans growing interest in Afghan affairs resulting from its presence in American media. ASA recognizes that the gateway to acheiving the ultimate goal of peace resides in knowledge and understanding. It is for this reason that the ASAs mission includes promoting an understanding of Afghan religion, culture, and politics.

ASA also helps organize the annual Afghan Awareness Week every May. In addition, ASA holds an annual charity banquet in hopes of raising money for various charity organizations in Afghanistan.
