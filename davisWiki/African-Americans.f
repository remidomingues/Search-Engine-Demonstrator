AfricanAmericans, also referred to as blacks, are an Race & Ethnicity ethnic group which involves some ancestry from the continent of Africa.

Though Davis is a relatively integrated community, the general perception among AfricanAmericans is that there is substantial bias against blacks in the city.  Some blacks choose not to apply to Davis, because they fear that they would be unwelcome in this town.  Blacks are proportionally the largest underrepresented group at UC Davis compared to Californias Demographics.  In the past, wiki:WikiPedia:Affirmative_Action Affirmative Action gave minority students a slight edge in admissions, but the program is now illegal in California.

Most of the collected Police Misconduct Stories stories of discrimination come not from the University, but from the Police. AfricanAmericans are 2.4% of the population but account for 9.2% of arrests; whether this is due to Race & Ethnicity racial profiling or other factors is unknown. Also unknown is the percentage of AfricanAmericans from other areas What Should I Know If Im Arrested arrested while committing crimes in Davis.

ASUCD was the first UC student government to have an AfricanAmerican ASUCD President President and ASUCD Vice President VicePresident.

 Hair Styling 
Since most every hair stylist in Davis knows how to cut caucasian hair and Davis is about 90% white/Asian it seemed most appropriate to include hairstylists on this page rather than incorporating it on Beauty Salons and Barber Shops. As far as this wikivangelist knows, there are no stylists in Davis who cater to African American client√®le, though some hair styling products can be found at Rite Aid. This list will therefore necessarily be heavily skewed toward businesses in outlying areas such as Sacramento. Also keep in mind that many of these shops are very small and cannot accommodate credit card purchases, and many may not accept checks. (Note: if you have issues with hair information being posted here, but are of some other ethnicity, please just go to another page!)
  Ebony & Ivory African Braiding just does braids, weaves and twists. The price is relatively high ~$80/25 cornrows, but the quality is always excellent. Nearby beauty supply houses can provide synthetic hair extensions in a wide range of colors/textures/styles. This is a cashonly business. 7125 Franklin Blvd., Sacramento, 916/4272198
  http://federicocollege.com/ Federico Beauty Institute doesnt do braids, but has a diverse staff of instructors and a student body that gets a breadth of experience with different hair types; prices are very low and they also offer very inexpensive spa treatments. 1515 Sports Dr., Sacramento, 916/9294242
  King of Curls does braids as well as some other styling/chemical treatments. Prices are low ~$36/25 cornrows, but the quality is sketchy. Most of the braiders in this shop are teen girls and turnover is high in part because they get paid poorly. This business accepts cash or ATM. 4751 Freeport Blvd., Sacramento, 916/7360808
  University Haircutters other barber, David, might be a good bet.  He told me he works as the only caucasian at a particular barber shop in the Sacramento area which caters to AfricanAmericans.
