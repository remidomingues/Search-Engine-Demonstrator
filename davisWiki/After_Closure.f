These comments were made after Sogas closed in late 2008.  The location now hosts a Chaat cafe.

20081119 17:50:46 nbsp Sogas is now a Chaat Cafe (http://www.chaatcafes.com/) restaurant. The food is cheaper than Kathmandu. I liked it, but Im not an Indian food connoisseur.

I dont know if it was just a ghost in the machine, but when we got the bill, the receipt still had Sogas on it, as well as the usual Customer Copy and then a Sogas Copy. The waitress said not everything is in the machines yet. Perhaps the manager is electing to still call the restaurant Sogas? Users/JeffStuart

20081120 13:36:46 nbsp Yep its Indian food, Im not sucha  fan of Indian food but it wasnt bad. Had the tandori chicken dinner. not sure what the name is though. Sogas? 21seven by Chaat cafe is on the menu, but even staff called it Sogas. Went back for a beer later and got turned away cause I had a Texas DL. But the bouncer wasnt been a prick about it, just said that out of state DL is to easy to forge since they dont know what a Texas DL is supposed to look like. Theyre just trying to clean the place up I guess. So dont go for the bar at night without a CA DL, youll waste your time. Users/NT

20081120 14:12:53 nbsp Wait. . .Sogas is now serving Indian food?  Really?

Im officially in mourning.  This place back in the day was the It Spot.  The place was classy and served fabulous cuisine.   Im super bummed about this change.

Another Indian food restaurant.  Just what Davis needs. . .  Users/CurlyGirl26

20081120 15:03:55 nbsp One of my customers told me there was an Indian place nearby that opened up.  After walking around downtown, I thought the customer was confused, but I guess I was wrong.  Im sorta happy there is a chaat cafe opening up (I know its another Indian restaurant, but its slightly different).  Id be content if this stayed and Kath went away (not that I have anything against Kath) cause I like the Berkeley chaat houses (Yay!  Pani puri!).  Im totally trying this place today!

And on a side note: I have mixed feelings about Sogas leaving.  I loved it back in the day, but in the past few years it really went downhill for me. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

 Postscript: I just went to their website.  Seems like its a chain fastfood cookiecutter place.  Im not so hyped anymore.  I need to go visit Berkeley soon...

20090127 10:10:26 nbsp I didnt realize Sogas had closed.  Based on all the comments, I can see why.  We used to love Sogas and was the place to go for a special night out.  But maybe they got too big for their britches.  Our first time in the new location, we arrived at 6 p.m. on a Sunday evening and they were out of the specials they had given us a menu for.  When we ordered substitutes, they were out of those things too.  We ended up having a salad.  The service was the worst Ive ever seen in a restaurant.

I wrote a note coplaining about our experience and it was the very first restaurant to which I have written where I didnt get some sort of compensation for our trouble.  The owner just didnt seem to care.

We tried it once more, only because we had a 2 for 1 coupon.  If anything the service (there were only FIVE tables occupied) was more abominable than before.  Our dinner took an hour and a half and the food was not very good.  I watched the waitress stand by the new computerized cash register with our money for so long I thought she must surely be checking her email and play ing a video game (did I mention there were only FIVE tables occupied at the height of business).

My son and his wife waited so long to have their order taken on their only visit to Sogas that they finally left and nobody noticed.

Sogas was a wonderful restaurant in its day, but it sure went downhill faster than any other estabishment Ive ever seen (except, perhaps, Discoveries when it changed hands) Users/BevSykes
