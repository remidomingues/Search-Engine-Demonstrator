Life After College

Some of us are pondering the aftermath of graduating from college...jobs? traveling? moving home? grad school? any other ideas??

 Working Abroad
  Is there anyone else out there who wants to move to another country? or is planning on working abroad? or who is      going to work abroad? teaching English?
  Is there anyone out there participating in a program that sets you up with such?
  Is there anyone out there participating in the Japan Exchange and Teaching program (JET)?
  Users/MeredithGlaser would love to know...and perhaps meet at Mishkas for coffee and a chat

 Staying in Davis
 Employment locally.
 Stay In Davis

Moving Home
 Moving Day

Grad School
  Graduate School of Management for an MBA
  King Hall School of Law for a JD
  School of Veterinary Medicine for a DVM (or, if you believe in doctoral parity, you could just call it a VD... just dont call it that in front of your vet student wife)
  Go to another college for a grad degree (UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, UCSD)  Please note that your grades will have to be good to attend one of these schools.
