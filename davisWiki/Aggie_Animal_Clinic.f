20070730 12:37:14 nbsp I took my cat here to start his vaccinations and they spent more time trying to sell me IAMS products than checking my cat.  The vet gave my cat a clean bill  of health but two weeks later I took him to another vet and he was diagnosed with a grade 34 heart murmur (which is pretty serious).  It is possible that the heart murmur wasnt present at this time, but it is also possible that it was and the vet missed it because he spent so little time with my cat.
Also, my the vet forced the vet tech to give my cat a vaccination that he was too young to receive.  I dont know how this may have affected his health.
I will not be going back. Users/thisheatiskillingme

20071210 01:56:34 nbsp My cat (who passed away at age 18), my last dog, and my current dog are (or have been) clients of the Aggie Animal Clinic.  All the vets here (including Jeep) and caring, compassionate doctors.  Jeep spends time at UC Davis keeping up on the latest in veterinary medicine.  I have nothing but complete confidence in them.  Rather than forcing my dog(s) to be examined on a stainless steel table (as my first dog was at the Davis Animal Hospital), Jeep and the other vets sit on the floor with us and comfort the scared animals as much as they can.  They are great explaining pet health care, and when there is a medical problem, they explain the issue in terms I can understand and offer the alternatives that are available for treatment (and costs and explained up front).  While I am sure there are other good veterinarian practices in the region, I highly recommend the Aggie Animal Clinic.  And when I compare the costs of health care for me for a simple procedure versus some serious doctoring for one of my pets, I am astounded that medical professionals can charge so little.  It is clear that these vets love the animals they treat and do so without trying to milk pet owners for maximum profit.  And for those on limited incomes, they have frequent low cost clinics.

20080929 15:36:04 nbsp Aggie is fantastic.  The vets are very good and very nice, and they know their stuff.  In some cases their prices are a little high, but their standard of care is also excellent during procedures.  I take my cat there, and my girlfriend worked there for some time.  Highly recommended.

20100215 09:17:02 nbsp Hands down, Aggie Animal is the best vet clinic I have ever seen  and Ive seen many. We have been going there for several years, and they have worked with us on every level. They worked with us to thoroughly research and care for two of our animals mysterious conditions  and yes, they did sit down on the floor because thats where I was sitting. When it became clear that we were going to lose animals, they supported us emotionally, compassionate at every step. They worked with us when we had to take an animal to UC, Davis because it was after hours, and they consulted with them on a baffling condition. They work very, very hard and with utter dedication. They charge a tiny fraction of what my doctor charged for identical procedures for myself; theres no way any of them are in it for money! They have my everlasting gratitude. They are my role models in their commitment to compassion even when being compassionate is very inconvenient and costly. Users/tmcrae
