UC Davis affiliates are issued AggieCards to identify themselves as people associated with the university. UCDMC affiliates have a different card. AggieCards replaced the older style Reg card reg cards in Fall 2010 for students; they are optional for faculty, staff, visiting scholars, and retirees. In addition to identifying university affiliates, AggieCards can also be used as US Bank ATM/Debit cards if you open up a US Bank student checking account.

Warning: US Bank conducts a hard credit pull if you open an account with them. This is the worst type of credit inquiry. This lowers your credit score and can damage your credit rating. So be careful about opening accounts with them.

You can get an AggieCard in 161 Memorial Union, on the first floor across the hall from the MU Information Center between the hours of 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.

There is a $15 charge to replace a lost AggieCard.

A valid AggieCard can be used to:
  Check out books from Campus Library Libraries including: Shields Library Shields, Shields Library Reserves Reserves, Physical Sciences Library Physical Sciences and Engineering, Health Sciences Library Carlson Health Sciences and movies from Hart Hall.
  Ride Unitrans and Yolobus, if youre a registered undergraduate. Undergraduate student fees pay for unlimited bus riding on these services.
  Gain admission to the ARC if you are a registered student (your student fees pay for a membership) or you have purchased a membership.
  Get into your Residence halls dorm or the 24 Hour Reading Room.
  Buy stuff with money from your US Bank student checking account at any place with an wiki:wikipedia:Interlink_(interbank_network) Interlink terminal. This feature is only available if you open up a US Bank student checking account. The card can be used to get cash at an ATM or can be used to make PIN based purchases. It cannot be used for signature purchases like a credit card.
  Swipe in to the Dining Commons if you have a meal plan.
  Buy food at the Silo & Davis_Food_Coop Davis Food Coop with Aggie Cash.
  Identify yourself when using credit card at the Coffee House, Trudys, the Silo, the UC Davis Bookstore Bookstore, and more.
  Charge stuff to your student account at UC Davis Bookstore campus bookstores, provided you have a second form of photo ID, and are spending more than $5.
  Charge stuff at the Bike Barn such as repairs and merchandise as long as the purchase is over $5.

Additionally, many places will give you a student discount on goods and services if you show them a student ID (like the AggieCard). Some Frat Parties also use AggieCards to keep nonstudents out. If you want to verify that an AggieCard belongs to a registered student, the Registrar has a https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/validation/index.cfm website. This is how the ASUCD Elections Committee verifies that signatures on petitions belong to currently registered students.
