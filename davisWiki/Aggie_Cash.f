The Aggie Cash account is located right on the UC Davis Aggie Card ID Card and can be used by students, faculty, and staff. Aggie Cash can be used to eat at popular (and heck, even unpopular) restaurants on and off campus. You can cows deposit any amount of money into your Aggie Cash account. It can save about 10% at certain places (mainly on campus) and most of the time does not get charged sales tax.

It was formerly known as the Off Campus Meal Plan. It was a rebranding for Munch Money.

IMPORTANT UPDATE:  After the 20132014 School Year the off campus aggie cash program will end, meaning that there will be no off campus vendors accepting aggie cash, after June 13 2014.

The offcampus network of Aggie Cash will be discontinued on June 13, 2014. Click here for frequently asked questions about this program change.

12/11/07  Is this page really up to date?  I have a meal plan and occasionally convert swipes to aggie cash; I went to pita pit once and they would not accept it for whatever reason, I think woodstocks did the same to me too.  An up to date page on currently accepting eateries would be nice. JeffreyOropeza
  Its up to you to do it, same as every other thing on the wiki.

20080408 16:29:42 nbsp Id like an update as well Users/AnnaF
  Somebody needs to do it... somebody just like you!

20081206 08:14:43 nbsp I dont get the point of this.  It may make sense if, say, putting $10 on the card gave $13 in aggie cash, but how is this any different from a debit card?? Users/RohiniJasavala

20081207 17:24:23 nbsp aggie cash at the subway by the train station has a machine that doesnt work according to the guy there anyways too. But you can get discounts places with aggie cash, so its different than a debit card Users/AnnaF

20091117 12:34:33 nbsp Are you sure you guys have Aggie Cash, not Gold Plus? Users/maranda
  Im pretty sure that is the confusion. It is annoying how the Gold Plus was advertised as Aggie Cash at some point. Users/hankim
   Yeah, is there a Gold Plus page?  Maybe that would help clear up some confusion. Users/maranda

20101005 22:08:06 nbsp I edited the list to represent what is on the official website: http://dining.ucdavis.edu/myaggiecash/MyAggieCash/myaggiecash.com/locations.html

If there are any changes needed to be made, please make them.  Users/BmetalV
