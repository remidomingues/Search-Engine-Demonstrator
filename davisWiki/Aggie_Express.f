A word about Aggie Express from a previous employee:

Aggie Express closed its doors at the end of August, 2012. Its owner, Mohammad Mostafavi, was greatly interested in the betterment and empowering of Davis communityatlarge. Indeed, his favorite aspect of owning and operating Aggie Express resided in the relationships he forged with those who frequented the store. It was my own experience, in working for Mohammad, that many people asked about his whereabouts whenever he was not there, and asked me to pass on their greetings to him in his absence. Whenever he was there, he was able to strike up a conversation with many of the customers who came in, whether it was their first time in the store or their twentieth.

Mohammads desire was for the community to continue pursuing greener alternatives and solutions to our current ecological challenges. This, in fact, was a major reason why he opened Aggie Express: to present the community with the option of recycling their ink cartridges and toner rather than having to go and buy a new cartridge whenever their printer ran out of ink. He hopes, in light of Aggie Express passing, that the city of Davis will continue to pursue these (and other) alternative solutions for the sake of a more sustainable future.

Thank you to all of our customers who frequented the shop over the years, and to all those in the city of Davis whom Mohammad, I, and our other coworkers were able to befriend in our time spent working at Aggie Express. Thank you, everyone, for all of your business and kindness. We appreciate you all.

Sincerely,

The Team at Aggie Express




20071114 21:35:03 nbsp The owner is a nice, friendly, personable guy.  I felt good about buying my ink there, and it was cheaper than it was on the internet (though also generic). Users/MissL

20080709 23:59:04 nbsp Isnt this now a textbook store? Users/MaryLieth

20080710 00:04:59 nbsp You might be thinking of Culpepper Used Books Culpepper, which is directly behind this store, around the corner. Users/JoePomidor

20081022 12:51:48 nbsp This man that owns store is more than help full just a great man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Users/Brians

20081118 10:53:17 nbsp really helpful and fair prices too.  Users/inu

20081120 23:49:15 nbsp Mohammed, the man who runs the store, is super nice and really helpful. If youre one of those people that needs to ship something but needs someone else to box it correctly and ship it correctly, he is the guy. I cant tell you how many times Ive gone there and hes provided nothing but personal service. And the toner??? Wow, super cheap. I almost bought cartridges elsewhere. So glad I didnt. Users/condemned2bfree

20090223 15:11:42 nbsp A friend pointed me to AE via the wiki and Im glad he did.  I also had excellent, friendly service from Mohammed while shipping my sisters birthday gift via fedex.  Ill be back. Users/JamesShearer

20090304 16:28:06 nbsp Very nice guy, as others have said. Ive only shipped through him, so I cant say if his prices are competitive, but he gets the job done. Users/Ash

20090406 17:08:06 nbsp Can anyone tell me how much it is to refill ink from here? I have Dell in Cartridge type T5029. I want to see if this location is cheaper than Office max... Users/YuJinChoi
  I dont know off hand, but if you call the store, he will tell you.  Users/condemned2bfree

20090531 19:56:41 nbsp I have sent things from this store and it was fine, but I bought one of their dell friendly cartridges of black ink and it doesnt work very well on my printer. I cant turn in assignments with every other line unreadable. I would not recommend buying their cartridges.

Update: I brought a sample of what the printing job was looking like, and the cartridge. He replaced the cartridge, and made sure I knew how to install it in my printer correctly. I would buy from this store again.  Users/willowspirit10
  This happened once out of the many cartridges Ive purchased from there, and I returned it and he gave me a replacement no questions asked. In fact, he warns you that sometimes theres a dud, and hes happy to replace it. I cant tell you how much $$$ Ive saved purchasing used cartridges.  Users/condemned2bfree

20100205 17:42:25 nbsp The owner of Aggie Express is easily the sweetest man ever! I lost my credit card today at the store, and he tried very hard to contact me so I can get my card! I also sent some packages with him and he gets everything done efficiently, and with great service! Users/essyyun
  THAT is what makes the wiki great  recognizing the tiny, nondirectly business things that make somebody a loyal fan of a place.  Glad you got your card, and  wow!  this guy has a solid love within the community! wj

20100508 01:14:06 nbsp Another great experience with the owner.  I had 2 inks filled at the store (saved total of $20).  When I got it home it wouldnt print.  I called and the owner researched my printer to see if there were known errors.  Then I brought them back in for him to look at. He worked some magic. I went home, and the cartridge worked!!

He also told me if it ends up not working he would refund.  His quote if it doesnt work for you, it doesnt work for me.  What a business Philosophy.  Thanks for great service! Users/toolej

20100526 09:36:05 nbsp Great return policy! ) theyll take any exchange or return granted you have the receipt and its returned in the same condition! nooooooooooooo questions asked! Users/ichliebecarebear

20101025 14:32:11 nbsp Just stopped by today to ship a package after reading these reviews (and the horror stories of other places), the owner was not there, but the person working was honest, helpful and didnt push any additional services, granted I already had boxed/taped my package, so I cant say if they charge or not for those. I would definitely come back without hesitation. Users/theyangster

20101220 13:53:07 nbsp I wish they would have told me that there is a charge to use your credit card. The counter person didnt even mention it and I only noticed it after I got the receipt. Very sneaky!!!! Users/Venk

20110703 23:59:47 nbsp a couple weeks ago, i purchased two printer cartridges for my HP printer. the guy at the front told me that refurbished cartridges were the same quality, just not filled by HP themselves. i bought one in black and one in color. i just opened the color cartridge today and i tried printing practice tests for my midterm, and theres no color at all! what a waste of money! i dont have my receipt anymore, so idk if i can get a refund.  Users/xsnickerdoodle
 I got a problem cartridge there several years ago and he replaced it a couple weeks later with no hassle whatsoever. Users/TomGarberson

20110925 11:43:25 nbsp Went there to get some personal papers notarized. All was required that in the appropriate box I should be identified by passport or drivers license to be alive. Period. Mohamed insisted to read my personal papers before notarizing, which I didnt let him. He is rude, sneaky, and misinformed. Would not recommend doing business with him Users/PTBan
  Notarization of Incomplete Documents: A notary may not notarize a document that is incomplete. If presented with a document for notarization, which the notary public knows from his or her experience to be incomplete or is without doubt on its face incomplete, the notary must refuse to notarize the document. (Government Code section 8205) on Page 16 of Notary Handbook, Published by: Debora Bowen, Secretary of State, Notary Public Section 2011. Mohammad

20120225 10:46:31 nbsp Its 10:44 on a Saturday and no one is here. Theres no sign on the door saying its supposed to be closed today. Either they changed their hours which needs to be updated on this site and their website or someone didnt show up for work. Guess Im gonna have to drive all the way down to the post office.
