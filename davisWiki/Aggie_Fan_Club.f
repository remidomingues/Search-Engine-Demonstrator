One of the clothing stores in town. They carry items with the Aggie logo.  They also make special order clothing with greek letters on them.

The store has closed, but its sister store in Woodland, CA remains open.

20070501 08:46:33 nbsp There is a sign on the door saying that the store is moving in May, but if I recall correctly it didnt say where the store is moving to.  I didnt have a pen and paper with me, so there may be more details on the sign. Users/CovertProfessor
