The Fight Song of the UC Davis University of California at Davis. Though most students (At least those who arent in the Aggie Band) have no idea what the lyrics to it are, the  Aggie Pack has been working to train and teach all incoming freshmen the song. Unfortunately, Aggie Packs lyrics screen has some small errors, irking the band to no end.  Today enough of the students actually sing the words at basketball games for it to be heard throughout the ARC Pavilion. Rumor has it if you sing the fight song when checking in at games you will receive tube socks. This is one of the Aggie Songs.

{{{Lift up your voices, nows the time to sing.
This is the day the Victory Bell will ring.
Loyal Aggies, all for one.
Never stopping til weve won,
Because the Mustang will show our team the way to fight,
Charging the enemy with all his might. Lets go.
Lets win. Todays the day The Aggies will fight!
Fight! Fight!}}}


A rendition can be found on the Aggie Bands website at http://camb.ucdavis.edu/camb/multimedia/sounds.html and can be heard at the end of every Aggie Band performance.

The song references the Victory Bell and the UC Davis mascot, the Mustang. In recent years, the word Mustang has been emphasized/shouted a bit louder when the song is sung, to reinforce that its the official mascot.
