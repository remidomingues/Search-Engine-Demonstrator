During the 20052006 academic year, The Foreign Correspondent was a column in the The California Aggie on page 2, that runs alongside Users/MichaelGiardina Michael Giardina. When Ryan P. Fuller served as editor and chief, this column space was reserved for Guest Columns; after the columnist who used to write there was fired/quit. However, this space was later reserved for students studying abroad when the paper was under the leadership of Daniel Stone.

Under the leadership of 20062007 Editor in Chief Peter Hamilton, the Foreign Correspondent was eliminated on May 26 and likely will not be returning in the fall.
