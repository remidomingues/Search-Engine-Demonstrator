Aggie Garden offers onebedroom garden style apartments for $800/month, and the security deposit is $400 March 2005. The complex is on Unitrans P/Q bus line. There are 24 units at this complex, and a small private parking lot for the residents. The apartments are pretty spacious for 1bedroom apartments, with a walkin closet and a wooden desk built into the bedrooms, and a builtin bookshelf above the desk. Residents are encouraged to grow potted plants on their patios and balconies to beautify the surroundings.

The complex is managed by a lady by the name of Grace, and she is in the process of improving the landscaping around and inside the complex. She says that mostly grad students, couples, and postdocs stay at the complex, so it is free of the usual noisiness found in many Davis apartment complexes. Grace says that she prefers to rent single bedroom apartments because of the kind of residents it attracts. Additionally, although Highway 113 is nearby, it may sometimes not be heard from the complex.

20060505 08:54:59 nbsp Manager is friendly but can not get a hold of them when needed. They are almost never around. Office hours dont exist. They come in whenever they want. Complex is pretty decent. Laundry is on the small side. Office, laundry, and pool are gated. You need keys to get in. All one bedroom apartment with mostly grad students living in them. Small parking lot. Quiet. Overall a nice place to live, but dont expect the management to be around when you need them. She has assistants who live around the complex, but they too are almost never around. Good luck. Users/StudentAtDavis
  Although I agree from living here that the management is slow to respond, it seems that the person above was not willing to find out what the deal was with the gates. I have never encountered any locked gates or doors. But for a while, the gate that faces Arthur street was locked at night because some students living across the street were coming in at night to use the pool and frequently left a mess behind. You also do not need keys for the laundry, and there hardly are any laundry conflicts because the complex only has 24 units  2 washers and 2 dryers seem to be plenty for the complex. And Ive got a lot of clothes.
 But I feel that I must add a big concurrance to the observation that the manager is slow to respond to apartment issues  a big builtin shelf in the bedroom fell off the wall, and as of this posting it has been a week and a half and nothing has happened. Makes it hard to lead a normal life when theres a huge shelf in the middle of ones bedroom. Ugh Users/KarlMogel

20080326 20:51:56 nbsp I thought they were going to post about this, but I guess they didnt. Some of the apartments at this complex are a mess. My cat kept catching mice and rats, which were also scurrying around in the walls. My neighbor had the ceiling collapse on them while they were in the bathtub, and they still didnt get all their deposit back.

As I mentioned before, the shelving unit fell off the wall one day, and the management told me to keep it in the apartment. After a short amount of time I got fed up and put the shelf outside. When it fell, it broke some of our stuff, and chipped a family heirloom, and Grace refused to pay for any of it. It may have just been our building, so if you decide to take a chance with Aggie Garden Apartments, do not live in units 2124.

The place looked nice, and was pleasant, but theres something messed up about the condition of the place. Nice to have your landlord literally driving a luxury car while ceilings and shelves are falling down on people. Users/KarlMogel

20090905 22:05:27 nbsp Lovely, quiet little complex with a beautiful pool and really neat floorplans.  None of the units, however, has central ac/heat. Users/deeray82

20111121 19:49:11 nbsp Roman, the apartment manager, is the best landlord Ive ever had, Ive lived here for three years. He remodeled our bathroom for free when he was doing yearly upgrades on the vacant apartments that were getting new tenants. Id recommend this complex to anyone. Users/SovietSonya
