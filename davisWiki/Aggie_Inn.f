20070228 13:36:36 nbsp I stayed here in 2006 while homeless on Moving Day. I had the corner room on the bottom floor looking at the 1st/B St. intersection. It was quiet and nice. Continental breakfast in the morning was bagels, muffins and cereal with juice and coffee. I didnt utilize many of the other advertised amenities, but after living for three years without cable, it was lovely to watch TNT and TBS.  Users/ElleWeber

20080428 20:27:27 nbsp Very nice place to stay. Free wireless internet as well. I stayed here for a few days when I visited campus. Very nice rooms and fancy looking/feeling. Highly recommended, although a bit pricey. Must be the mature landscaping. Users/BrandonBarrette
