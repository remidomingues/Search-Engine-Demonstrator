 The Aggie Public Arts Committee 
The Aggie Public Arts Committee (APAC) is a committee under the ASUCD Associated Students of the University of California, Davis (ASUCD). It was created in 2010 to help promote and facilitate the installation of public art on campus and in the greater Davis community. The mission of the Aggie Public Arts Committee is to enable the UCD community an experience that is enhanced with the beauty of art, culture and free expression on campus.

The Aggie Public Arts Committee defines “public art” as artwork that is created for the public to experience. Specifically, APAC wants public art to represent the UCD community though themes of community, history, education, love, culture, vision, curiosity, and tolerance. The Committee believes that public art should enliven an area and contribute to UCD community pride and identity.

 Functions of the Committee: 
  Receive proposals of sculptures, murals, paintings, photographs and other art mediums from students/staff/alumni/other groups affiliated with the university in order to review and potentially approve for installation on campus.
  Contribute to the cultural enrichment of the UCD student body by adding art to public spaces that is aesthetically pleasing, thought provoking, visually stimulating, and of enduring value.
  Work as a liaison between artists, students passionate about art and the ASUCD
  Provide an outlet for students of all skill levels, interests and backgrounds to be involved with the creation and installation of artwork on campus and in the Davis community.
  Ensure that public art is incorporated into UCD long term plans for future campus projects, expansion and development.
  Work through all appropriate means to encourage public art.
