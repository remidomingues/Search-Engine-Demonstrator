Aggie Reuse Store is a nonprofit organizations nonprofit organization.

The mission of the Aggie Reuse Store is to divert materials from the landfill and to redistribute them at low cost for reuse or repurposing. Its essentially a minithrift shop inside of the MU, and a great place to grab some cheap crafting supplies.

Background
Aggie ReStore comes out of the work of UC Davis Design professor Ann Savageau who collects campus and community waste for use by students in her sustainable design class. Over the last couple of years, Professor Savageau has found the amount of materials overwhelming but their creative reuse potential limitless. Aggie ReStore hopes that salvaging some of these items from the trash will benefit people affected by rising tuition and living costs while also supporting Professor Savageau’s original mission to spread environmental awareness through creative reuse.

Your donations help us achieve our mission to both provide students with a variety of low cost goods and foster creative reuse on campus. If you have unwanted items, send an email to aggierestore@asucd.ucdavis.edu to arrange a pick up or drop off of your donations. Proceeds go back into store operations and future programming.

20120408 17:53:30 nbsp Im so happy a shop like the Aggie ReStore exists on campus! Its fantastic conceptually and there is always a wide variety of materials on sale. Everything is cheaply priced as well. Ive left there on many occasions with my hands full of things to get crafty with.

My only complaint is that the hours are pretty short, so by the time Im finished with class the place is closed.  Users/V
