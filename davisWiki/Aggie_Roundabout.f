At the intersection of West Quad and Shields Avenue is the original painted rendition of the Aggie Logo. Aggie Roundabouts seem as good as any other name for these additions to the campus.

20062007 ASUCD President Kareem Salem, the UCD administration, and the Aggie Pack coordinated together to have six Bike Circle bike circles on campus painted with different UC Davis logos.

In addition, there is a Go Ags! logo in the roundabout at the intersection of Shields Avenue and East Quad.




I am wondering how much this cost. Also, Im curious about the process used to stencil this massive logo on the ground. It wouldve been neat to watch it being done. Users/EliseKane

  It would be cool if they planted one on the circular lawn south of Mrak Hall, or if they planted a rendition of the Seal Of The University in a variety of different colored ground cover. Users/JasonAller
