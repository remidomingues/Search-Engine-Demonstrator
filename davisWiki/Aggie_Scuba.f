The Scuba Club at UC Davis, otherwise known as Aggie Scuba, is UCDs sole local resource for students and faculty interested in diving. For those certified, the club offers Club Dives once a month at a variety of locations, usually in beautiful Monterey, CA. On occasion, larger club trips are organized, such as a trip in Fall 2011 in which Aggie Scuba met up with the CSU SLO Scuba Club and chartered a boat to dive the Channel Islands more than 3 hours off the Southern California Coast.

If you are interested in getting certified as a SCUBA diver, Aggie Scuba can help with that too! While they will not directly certify you, they will point you towards shops in the local area (30 minutes drive either way). All About Scuba in Fairfield, CA sponsors the club by giving steep discounts to its members on both certification and gear purchases/rentals. As long as you have the interest and drive, Aggie Scuba will make every effort to help you get certified.

If you would like to attend a meeting, check up on the Facebook page, or shoot the club an email! Meetings are once a month to reduce impact to member schedules, naturally, they would rather spend more time diving then meeting!
