## Hey, Jason... you need to leave the double vertical lines (the ||) at the front and end of each line or else the wiki wont know to format it as a table. Also, the markup like the Address() macro are needed to place your business on the wiki map.  It is a good idea to leave that kind of stuff when youre editing the entry.

  20080302 20:43:28 nbsp I went at this place visible distance from redrum burger.He doesnt rip you off like other places and his price for smog is right.Honest and very efficient guy.He is the owner and smog technician, they open on sundays also.I will have my other two cars smogged at this place mate. Users/lewinsky
  20080304 22:21:43 nbsp Had my truck smogged here today and he was very pleasant,neatly dressed took care of me.It took him about 15 to 20 mins to smog my truck while i was waiting.Their waiting room is so clean and you can walk to the park towards downtown while he is doing the smog inspection.He even explained me how clean was the emissions coming out the exhaust of my old truck. Users/prethy

20080313 16:15:52 nbsp The service was fast.  I went to In and Out and back and it was done in around 15 minutes.  The price was reasonable and he even offered a free retest if my car failed (it had failed a smog test previously).  The offer for a free retest sealed the deal, since the last place that failed me would charge again.   Users/GraceAn

20080319 09:55:06 nbsp I have an older vehicle that runs on propane. I took it to a couple of places and they told me that they couldnt smog it! I asked them why and they said that they had never done it before and didnt want to attempt it either. I then took it to Aggie Smog and he got it done in less that 20 minutes! Users/Taz

20080324 03:31:56 nbsp I got my car smogged here a couple days ago.  Its a oneman operation, and the owner/technician is very friendly.  I like to support small businesses, and the price was reasonable too.  In addition to getting 10$ off using the coupon listed here, I also got an additional student discount.  The owner is a great guy, and I would recommend Aggie Smog for a reasonably priced and quick smog check.   Users/mrchau

20080406 13:19:06 nbsp I just got back from Aggie Smog and I am pleased. Im new to this whole smog check requirement, so I decided to try out this place cause its new. Users/Jasen was really nice and helpful and he gave me a student discount on top of the $15 off coupon. I highly recommend this place, I dropped off my car and walked around downtown. Less than 25 minutes later I got a call that it was done. Very professional and quick.  Users/BrandonBarrette

20080415 23:27:07 nbsp I got my car smog tested here and I was very impressed.  I called ahead of time to see whether he was busy or not.  He finished in under 15 minutes.  I will definitely go back when I need to get my car retested. Users/AmandaAbughosh

20080420 12:43:08 nbsp this guy is courteous, fast, and friendly.  OPEN on Sundays Users/matt31

20080510 10:40:32 nbsp This is the only place to go in Davis for testonly smog checks.  Jasen is extremely courteous and takes the time to explain your test results or, in the case of the person before me, what to have fixed before you come back for a free retest.  Jasen also doesnt charge extra for the new evap test on pre95 cars.  Ive been to all the other testonly businesses in Davis and found the employees to either be indifferent or just plain rude.   Users/mchevy

20080523 15:16:08 nbsp I went on a Friday morning and only had to wait about 30 minutes, then my car was done.  There was only one person there waiting when I came in.  The technician, who I think was the owner as well, was very polite.  The waiting room is small, but clean and comfortable.  Check their website  I found a $15 coupon there which they happily accepted. Users/MicheleTobias

20080624 13:50:21 nbsp I went to Aggie Smog on a Tuesday to get my truck smogged, and there was no wait. He is polite and honest, not to mention extremely quick. Only 15 minutes and I was on my way! I highly recommend him.  Users/bjb2455

20080709 20:00:27 nbsp I went here yesterday and was out of there in 20 minutes, and Jason honored the $15 coupon and gave me the student discount.  Very pleased. Users/MatthewPearson

20080713 15:25:16 nbsp I was a bit skeptical about all the positive comments I saw here. I decided to take my Lexus RX300 here for a smog test.  It turned out to be a disaster, 25 minutes into the test Jason came back and told me that the car can be not tested due to transmission problem.  My car drives fine and I did not experience any shift problem. I took my car to advance auto for smog test and the car passed the test without any transmission problem. The tech told me that my car has a nondisengageable 4wheel drive.  A two speed idle test should be performed instead of putting it on the dyno. I was shocked and hoping that my car is not damaged in any way due to Aggie incompetency. This guy sure does not know what he is doing......donâ€™t be fools by the reviews on this page. Take your car to a experience shop!
This guy is dishonest, why denied the facts. I will never take my car there. Advance auto sure knows what they doing, they will always have my bussiness.
Why all the positive and no negative comments? This guy is a fraud! He writes his own reviews and posted them under different alias.
 Users/rjohal

20080714 08:11:27 nbsp To whoever posted the last comment.Firstly i never came across a RX300 vehicle that i had a problem smogging.I do know that 4 wheel rx300 does have nondisengageable traction control,therefore TSI test has to be performed.I have smogged alot of vehicles like this.My records show i have not written any invoice showing a rx300 vehicle coming to the shop in the past 3 weeks.Maybe this person does not like seeing all this positive comments.I am the only smog tech in this shop who has never come across this issues. Users/jasen

20080714 10:39:36 nbsp Went here mainly because its a small shop, and I know what its like trying to be in business for yourself. I took in one of my project cars.  The Tech, was very helpful and very fast.  He explained what I need to do to get my car to pass, and said to bring it back after I fix the problems (almost there) to retest for free. This guy is good. Ill bring all my cars to him in the future. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080728 16:44:15 nbsp Attention to all readers of these reviews and existing and prospective customers of Aggie Smog  I am writing this in regards to the negative comments posted by rjohal. After reading his reviews, I can definitely tell that this guy knows what hes talking about, considering all those technical terms that one would never hear from their smog tech. I know for a fact that he is either a smog tech himself, working for Advance Auto repair, which is right across from Aggie Smog, or he is just one of Jasons relatives who is jealous of Jasons success in his business and cannot mind his own business. Think about it  hes the only person who left a negative review here, and hes saying dont be fooled by the reviews on this page! Hello! Theres a 12:1 ratio here! RJohal is the fool himself! I also know for a fact that he will come back to this page to answer back to anyone who has replied to his post, just like he did on 20080719 12:31:59. Get a life, you loser! Users/Taz

20080801 13:04:27 nbsp After reading all the positive comments I thought Id give this place a try. I recently bought a Jaguar XJ8 and took it over to Aggie Smog for the emmisions test. The process took him approximately 15 minutes while I went to grab some coffee around the corner. When I got back he had all the paperwork ready to go and even explained to me what the data means. He also offered some preventative maintenance tips that would help me keep the vehicle in great condition. Not too many people give advice without something in return.
After that experience I decided to take my 1992 Toyota Tercel to Aggie Smog. I explained to him that I was donating the vehicle to my brother. According to the Jasen, it did not require a smog check since the transfer was within the immediate family. That is the type of integrity all businessmen should show. A lot of places would have performed the test and charged me for it, knowing that it was not required. Heck, half of them probably wouldnt be aware of the fact that it was not required.

This guy is an A+ business man and knows the value of his customer base. He is on top of his game plan and a step ahead of the system. The business is easy to find and has many amenities nearby. Fast, honest and reliable service that you can count on. Keep up the good work Jasen. Users/Jagxj8

20080807 08:57:39 nbsp According to the website, the prices for cars and pick up trucks are $66.75                                                     plus $8.25 for the certificate. With the $15 coupon, thats about the same price as everywhere else in Davis.  Users/TinaBorjas

20080825 16:28:41 nbsp I decided to give this place a shot after hearing all the good things from my friends and family. As they had stated everything was correct!! I was really surprised by the whole experience, I didnt think a a new business like this could be so up to date and on top of that have a worlds best customer service. As I drove up to the shop I was greeted by Jasen and he asked what he could help me with. As he kindly told me to wait in the the waiting room and I helped my self to some water and candies he pulled my car in and started the diagnostic tests. After about 1520 minutes he came in and told me that everyhting looked good and my 2000 maxima had passed!! he explained to me briefly what he had done and what the results meant. I felt like I was in a doctors office accept being scared..lol.. Jasen is very knowleable in the smog business he knows what he is doing. I loved the whole experience and not forget his shop is located in the heart of Davis, very easy place to get in an out of. I really liked his honesty and his friendly business skills kuddos to you jasen. I had a wonderful expereince and cant wait to take my other family cars to him and I cant wait till my 07 Yukon is eligible for smog check so I can hand over to a tech who knows what he is doing and not feel scared but feel very comfortable like family...  Users/SRangee

20080911 15:17:34 nbsp Just got a smog check on my 95 Honda Civic.  Cost with coupon was $60, and it took 18 minutes.  Im very satisfied. Users/BrendanConnors

20081013 18:02:00 nbsp i brought my 94 mercedes c280 in today and he was very clear and fair about the smog test.  everything was taken care of in a quick fashion.  overall great service. A+ Users/noogooyen

20081014 11:18:41 nbsp Jasen was extremely friendly and efficient. There was only about a 15 minute wait and the waiting room is really nice. I just took my 1991 Corolla for a smog inspection and I would recommend Aggie Smog to anyone.  Users/jesstar

20081031 13:21:18 nbsp Got my car smogged here. went to prove the good reputations and they were all true ;).  Users/superdavis

20081125 09:24:26 nbsp I just took my 2003 CRV to get smog checked here, based on the good comments on the wiki.  I had a great experience!  It took about 15 minutes.  I walked over to Borders for a coffee and the owner called me on my cell phone as soon as it was done. With the coupon the price was $60.  Friendly service.  Highly recommended. Users/SuzanneM

20081212 16:19:00 nbsp Prompt service, reasonable rates, clean and courteous. Excellent! Users/DonShor

20081222 17:11:13 nbsp I dont usually leave comments, but this time I will.
Overall, the guy is fine: does his job fast and clean. However, I dont think he is any different from the rest of the guys that are out to get your money.
I came in for a smog check having my engine light on and asked him what are my chances of passing. He replied that it all depends on the system, but in the end my car failed due to my engine light being on, and as it turn out this is one of the first things they check. So, why do you say that it depends on the system if you know that when the engine light is illuminated  the car automatically fails smog?
In the end I asked him if I could just clear the codes and come back, but he told me to get the car repaired and then come back for a retest, otherwise, according to him, I wont pass. Apparently, Ive been around cars longer than he has, as I went home, cleared the codes, drove to the nearest smog check station and PASSED. NO mechanics, NO extra expenses on unnecessary repairs.

The conclusion is as follows:
If you dont have any problems with your car  this guy isnt better or worse than any other smog shops. Otherwise, find yourself  another shop, cause Jasen will send you spending you money for no reason. Users/bayer044

20081223 13:38:55 nbsp Very well said,the last comment here.The smog inspection is a valid test the reveals why your vehicle failed overall smog inspection,in your case check engine light that is part of visual and functional obd tests that is done half way of the the tests.That tests are determined visually and functionally by communicating with the vehiles ecm/pcm to check for any stored codes,or unsuccessfully completed obd 2 monitors.If your vehicles has failed that process,yes it fails the overall inspection.This is part of the test.We as a smogtest only station have to direct any failed inspection to any licensed smog and repair station so that it is diagnosed and repaired right.Vehicle owner can also do the repairs themselves if they want to and have it smogged again to pass the overall smog test.In your case you just cleared the codes and drove it to nearby smog station and it passed,but you did not diagnose or found the cause of the problem that is triggering that check engine light.Chances are the check engine light will come on if the it is not diagnosed or repaired the right way.
In conclusion we smog test only stations only do official smog inspections,we do not diagnose or repair any emissionsrelated repairs on vehicles.We refer motorists to specific test and repair facilities.
Here we offer a freeretest within 30 days if your vehicle fails the initial smog inspection. Users/jasen

20081230 14:54:41 nbsp They were super helpful in figuring out what was wrong with my car, and the guy that works there is really cute.  Users/FloridianPlywood

20090117 11:44:07 nbsp Very fast and efficient service.  Took 1015 minutes.  Guy was very polite and checked my coolant FREE OF CHARGE,(this place does not do repairs, so there was no motive)and gave suggestions as to what I should do.  Wonderful service, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!  Users/KMeo

20090129 12:19:40 nbsp I had a good experience here. The technician/owner seems like a nice guy with a good attitude. Service was quick. He was recommended by a mechanic I trust, Bob Redfield. Users/Cedric


20090210 09:07:41 nbsp Just to follow up with some comments here regarding check engine light on.Once the smog inspection is in progress and when it comes to inspect a vehicle for visual and functional test,the results has to be entered either pass or fail on any emission controls.On obd 2 or 1996 and up cars a functional test is performed where the analyzer reads codes,monitors from the vehicles pcm and commands a pass/fail under that functional tests.If you are not sure if your car will pass or fail with the check engine light on when at the smog station ask the tech ahead if you have any doubts regarding such issues.It is up to you if you want the tech to go ahead and do the smog inspection. Test only stations do not diagnose or perform emission related repairs.As a driver/owner of a vehicle,when you see a check engine light on on the dash panel it is your responsibility to have the car diagnosed at a repair station or if the owner can do it himself if he is capable.In conclusion if your vehicle has a check engine light on have it checked out before going for a smog check.Smog test is a ca official test,not a grade one spelling test. This site is always helpful and will answer alot of questions  http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/obdprog/obdfaq.htm Users/jasen

20090421 17:34:20 nbsp Very nice and friendly guy. Charged $60 because I was a return customer. Highly recommended. Users/patco

20090520 15:30:58 nbsp Just had a straightforward and generally pleasant experience here today. Called ahead to see what the wait was like (two people waiting, might be half an hour), dropped off the car then walked over to Rocknasium the gym to burn an half an hour or so. Car was ready sooner than expected and the gent behind the counter was polite and answered several procedural questions I had.  Users/KevinChin

20090612 14:35:28 nbsp Came in, filled out some paperwork, used the $15 coupon, waited 15 minutes tops for my car.  I didnt pass because of a loose part in the engine, but the owner (Jason) explained and pointed it out.  He also gave me a list of possible repair places.  Came back when I got it repaired, didnt pay for the 2nd smog test except for the passing certificate.  Ill recommend this place. Users/strawberry

20090721 19:30:00 nbsp I had a great experience with this place!  I was in the process of selling my car, and just needed the smog before I could finalize the deal.  Id never had a car smogged before, but the guy working there, Jason, made it really simple for me.  After I failed my initial test (its a really old car) he recommended a few things I might try to fix it up a bit in order to get it to pass.  They give a free retest within 30 days of failing the first one, and Im happy to say that my car finally passed, and I just sold it.  The test was relatively cheap (compared to other prices in Davis) and fast, and he was very helpful.  Id recommend him to anyone needing to get their car smogged. Users/buss013

20090722 16:26:28 nbsp took my 99 yukon with 200k+ miles here, I was in and out in 20 minutes.  great service.  with the consumer guide $20 off coupon it was $57 even!  Great service, fast, good price, and a passing smog cert!!!  Users/Carsonsig

20100307 09:40:46 nbsp I tried to go here, but they arent good about keeping hours on the weekends. I tried going on Sat 2/20 around 2pm and found a sign saying they were closing that day at noon. Tried again yesterday (Sat 3/6) at around 3pm and they were closed. Noticed on the sign that they are open the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, so I tried again this morning (3/7) at 9:15am. Closed again, so I went to EZ smog (which was open). Sorry Aggie Smog, you lost a customer. Users/Dani

20100307 09:46:42 nbsp Doing what I said Id do, removing Vlams ad hominem comment. Users/JimStewart

20100307 11:02:16 nbsp I thought this page would be a snarky comment on the smog in Davis like the Essence of Davis page :)

(I know theres no smog in Davis which is why it wouldve been even more humorous!) Users/AlexanderHo

20100308 15:42:08 nbsp Dani....I am so sorry about 3/6/2010.I had to close early that day around 2:30pm.I had to attend a funeral.There was a note on the left side of the window.We dont open on sundays anymore.Once again i apologize for inconvience. Users/jasen

20100309 13:27:53 nbsp First class smog testing service. I was in and out in about 15 minutes. It cost only 55 bucks with coupon, friendly mechanic, oh, and a passing smog certificate. I would recommend this place without hesitation, unlike another Davis test facility off F and Covell where the mechanic laughed at me when I told him Id driven for a while to warm up the car. Not sure what I find funnier  the fact the other place lost my business, or that they didnt get the chance to fail my car based on what would have been erroneous readings if Id brought it in cold. Anyway, go with Aggie Smog  theres no reason to go anyplace else. Users/MelDraper


20100427 12:57:18 nbsp I went here yesterday during my lunch break, because I got a recommendation from Jon at Triple A Automotive.  He was definitely right!   The guy who runs this place was very friendly and nice.  He smoged my car in about 1520 minutes while I ate my lunch in the office.  He also took the time to answer a bunch of questions I had afterwards.  Highly recommend this place, and will be returning next time I need to.    Users/JessicaAdams

20100520 09:31:12 nbsp I would recommend that you call before going. We tried to stop by on a Wed. at 3:30 and he was closed with a sign saying he would reopen the next day. Users/RachelD

20100811 09:11:24 nbsp The hours on wiki say 86 and the hours on their website say the same. I cant remember what the shop says, but the sign definitely says 8am and might say open until 6pm, but it might also be 5:30pm. Anyway, I went there at 5pm on a Monday and they were not open for some 3day span. Fair enough. But I went in the day after that span was over at 5pm and the place was closed up and dark with the CLOSED sign on. WTF?! So I went in the next morning at 8:10am and the same thing!! I asked the neighboring business if Aggie Smog was even still in business, since I was having serious doubts, and they said it usually opens at about 9. Some serious business fail, there. Post your goddamn hours of ACTUAL operation already!! Anyway, such poor work ethic led me to take my business to another shop.  Users/DanaMace
  Sometimes it takes a gentle nudge to get things done. Unfortunately, many businesses still feel the Wiki is a tertiary priority, at best, which is sad since it has the ability to reach so many. However, after you comments, the owners apparently heard something and have posted new hours right here on the Wiki. Gentle nudging..  Users/Wesone Wes

20100904 19:09:59 nbsp Excellent service as usual. Great advice for how to get our 1984 Toyota pickup to pass; we did it, it worked. And the price was reasonable. Thanks again Jasen! Users/DonShor

20110506 15:10:28 nbsp I tried going here twice during business hours and they werent open either time. The first time was a Wednesday about 40 minutes before closing (by the hours on the window, which state 5:00 rather than 5:30) and there was a closed sign, so I figured theyd just closed early and Id come back another time. Today though it was 2:00pm and there was no closed sign  just a locked door and dark window. I tried calling to see if maybe someone was in or I could at least leave a message asking when they would be open, but the phone just rang. It doesnt seem like theres any answering machine, and I definitely had the right number since I could hear the ringing coming from inside the office, too.

Maybe I just had bad luck, but from the comments it looks like some other people have had this problem as well. Users/BrittS

20110509 10:47:47 nbsp @ BrittsWe had to close early because of some issues with the machine on thursday and friday.There was a note on the window.Sorry for the inconvience. Users/jasen

20110815 20:34:51 nbsp Hands Down. Best place to get your car smog. I went to EZ smog the first time because I didnt know aggie smog was closed on Sundays. I failed the first time due to NOx and timing/idle speed. Did my retest and still failed both NOx and idle speed and i know i adjusted the timing and idle speed... I didnt expect them to tell me anything because its a test only check, but i was hoping theyd tell me something to fix the problem. Then I went to aggie smog and right off the back I could tell Jasen was there to help you pass. Jasen helped me pass my timing check by simply putting a mark on the pulley because the machine couldnt read the degrees (something EZ Smog would have never done or even told me about). I still didnt pass smog due to my NOx, but Jasen told me the problem. He actually took the time to explain to me what needed to be done, something i doubt many companies would not do. Anyways to keep it short, I finally passed smog today and i couldnt have done it without Jasens help. He definitely wants the best for everyone. You cant really beat that kind of customer service.  Thank you Jasen!

btw. he help me a lot more than what was written above.  Users/JohnE

20111129 10:27:57 nbsp took my 21 year old truck to be smogged today at a required test only place. Jasen was friendly and took the coupon I printed from Little Green Coupon machine. I had to wait a day while his machine was being serviced. Whole procedure went very quickly. Most importantly, I PASSED!!!! I suggest calling ahead, as I did, to make sure the machine is ready. Will definitely go back when I need my smog done again in 2 years. Users/HeatherF

20111208 16:29:56 nbsp Great place. Jasen is very nice. I showed him the printed wiki discount coupon, and instead of $10, I got $15 discount. Ten minutes later I had my car back and passed. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely go back again next year. Users/JeroenPost

20120119 17:40:45 nbsp I came in last week during a break from class to get a smog test for my car. There were two other people ahead of me but I still was able to go in and out of the place in less than 30 minutes. The guy working there was very nice and gave me a student discount on top of the coupon I got from the Little Green Coupon Book. Great service. I would come again. Users/DMendez

20120204 15:02:33 nbsp  I really didnt expect my best customer service experience in memory to come from a smog check only place. He refused to take my money the first two times I went there because he visually inspected my car and knew it was going to fail. The first time because my check engine light was on which is apparently an automatic fail. He suggested it was likely an 02 sensor and it was. The second time was for a different reason that would take too much typing to explain. Anyways, I think most places would take my money even if they knew I was going to fail. The actual smog check itself took less time than I could walk across the street, eat a cheeseburger at InNOut, and walk back (15 minutes).  Users/MikeyCrews

20121231 12:50:06 nbsp Two years ago got my smog done at Jasens shop and he has done repairs on my car as well. So when smog was due again my first thought was to go to Jasens shop and get it done since i liked the service provided and trusted him with my car. Today i walked out of his shop filled with disappointment and confusion. Jasen denied to service my car with NO Reason provided. I asked him why wouldnt he service my car? He said personal reasons. I found Jasens behaviour unprofessional and rude.  I believe that he should provide me with a valid reason and an apology. Just wanted to share my experience today with the returning customers and the future ones.  Users/Ashe

Jasen was very helpful, and genuinely wants each car to pass. He provided very insightful advice and also gave me a second free retest when the number showed that we were getting close. I did a slightly older car and since I paid cash he gave me a discount. Im pleased even thou Davis itself is in a smog2 standard zone. Daubert

20130322 21:10:47 nbsp Best Place Ever! the guy is super nice and actually cares that you pass your smog check. He actually went out of his way to help fix and make sure i pass my smog check (even with 2 cars waiting behind me). Any other place would have just took my money and wouldnt care if i failed. This guy was very considerate and generous. This place really deserve good business. It was also very cheap too since he gave me a discount for being a student. Users/bobjonesbobjones

20140310 18:09:47 nbsp First smog test in Davis While my car actually passed the smog test, he failed me because of the check engine light. Honestly he was rude on the way in, and he could have just told me before charging $68 that he would fail me regardless. In other cities smog checks are cheaper, and they arent out to fail people. He actually bragged that he failed three people that day.  Users/JoeBruin

20140311 07:53:41 nbsp  The smog inspection is a valid test the reveals why your vehicle failed overall smog inspection,in your case check engine light that is part of visual and functional obd tests that is done half way of the the tests.That tests are determined visually and functionally by communicating with the vehiles ecm/pcm to check for any stored codes,or unsuccessfully completed obd 2 monitors.If your vehicles has failed that process,yes it fails the overall inspection.This is part of the test.We as a smogtest only station have to direct any failed inspection to any licensed smog and repair station so that it is diagnosed and repaired right.Vehicle owner can also do the repairs themselves if they want to and have it smogged again to pass the overall smog test.I follow inspections by the laws and regulations of state of california and intructions via inspection anayzler In conclusion we smog test only stations only do official smog inspections,we do not diagnose or repair any emissionsrelated repairs on vehicles.We refer motorists to specific test and repair facilities.
Here we offer a freeretest within 30 days if your vehicle fails the initial smog inspection. Users/jasen
