Davisville Management Company provides complimentary highspeed wireless Internet service throughout the common areas of its related apartment complexes in Davis. The wireless (WiFi) network is intended to be used for entertainment purposes by residents and their guests free of charge.

The speed at which an individual can connect is dependent on many factors including:
  the quality of the wireless adapter;
  the distance from the access point;
  obstruction(s) between access point and computer;
  the number of users on the system; and
  the intensity of all users combined downloading at a given moment.

Davisville Management Company does not guarantee 24/7 Internet availability and does not make any representations of an end user’s Internet access speed because factors affecting WiFi access speed vary substantially with the conditions described above. Since the internet is an important part of everyones life, it is a good investment for individuals to have an alternate method of connecting to the Internet for times when the complimentary WiFi is not available. Often the WiFi in the clubhouses will continue to operate even if an access point within the apartment complex is interrupted.

To maximize everyones enjoyment of the complimentary WiFi service, there are a few simple rules to observe:

  The WiFi service connection may not be used for business uses or illegal activity;
  The WiFi service connection may not be used for file sharing with programs like Kazaa, Bearshare, Napster, etc.;

Management also reserves the right to update the rules at any time by written notice. It is strongly recommended to run an antivirus program and maintain a firewall on your computers.

Inspections – Apartments are inspected a minimum of three times.

  PreMoveout Inspection.  Two weeks prior to vacating of the rental unit, Aggie Square will offer a premoveout inspection.  This inspection allows the rental manager to highlight any potential cleaning or damage issues and provides ample opportunity for the renter to remedy those issues.

20050822 20:04:56 nbsp Dont like the managers.  They act like youre wasting their time every time you come in to talk to them.  Other than that, its pretty nice all around the complex.  Plenty of parking, and its real quiet. Users/MindyYang

20050921 23:51:33 nbsp oh yeah, these people are real shady with the security deposit, too.  my apartment was spotless in the end and my roommates barely lived there.  they still managed to make us pay for carpet and more paint jobs that were supposedly needed.  somehow the bill came out to be $460! Users/MindyYang

20051129 13:26:45 nbsp Charged me $250 dollars to clean my apartment after move out. It was practically spotless. I couldve hired a housecleaner to clean it for less than $50. What a scam. They also replaced the carpet even though it could have been cleaned. They told me not to clean it because they do it anyway. They replaced it without even attempting to clean it. If you live here, TAKE PICTURES to avoid being screwed. Users/ChrisMay

20070921 15:28:36 nbsp Yeah, I just got charged way overboard for painting. 250 Labor and 150 Paint. Thats how much youd pay if you wanted to change the color on your entire place.

Not to mention it hadnt been painted when I moved in. There were pinholes everywhere. $400 bucks for painting? Dont even dream of getting your deposit back here. Users/T

20070921 15:32:14 nbsp I dont know if they can charge you for a regular paiting, unless there was damage caused to the walls by the resident. But, it might be in the lease. Check out the Renters Rights page for links and info. Users/JamesSchwab

20090730 00:35:49 nbsp I like this place. I used to live in Pinecrest and just didnt like it. After two years the manager still didnt know I lived there. Here one of the managers is really nice (I think there are multiple and I dont really know the others). I dont go into the office much and she still is well aware of who I am and whats going on and shes always ready to chat a bit, sometimes a little too much, but hey, I get to feeling she cares. The rent is a bit high but with utilities included and the good location it seems reasonable.... also relative to other places in Davis. The interiors are pretty nice too, though I lucked out and got a bunch of new stuff (fixtures, showerhead, caulking, carpets) on movein. But i live on the Parque Plaza side and i feel like they might sequester the hooligans over here.... its like... this 50 foot stretch of parking lot is the Davis ghetto... well i twas last year but most of my neighbors moved... curious to see what this years neighbors have in store for me  Users/hitobito

20090816 00:57:48 nbsp Issues falling onto deaf ears is fine.  Its the sneer of arrogance and misplaced selfworth that gets to me.  The manager is evil!  My roommates and I all took turns on different days to remind her that our shower needed repairs.  Each time, one of us would come back reporting that same sneer and how it irritating it is when we know we send her rent checks every month!  Her Mexican handymen were cool though.  I decided to ask them about repairs directly rather than through her, and they did it for us out of pity and actual embarrassment that they were not notified.  Funny how they took the apartment complexs reputation more to heart than SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY PAID TO DO IT.  Take pictures.  Ripped us off on our deposit, too. Users/Lee85
 Do you think they werent also paid? I sure wouldnt do that for free.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

All the people are money hungry, rude, and selfish people. deposit was taken more than half off of some overly expensive labor. everything was fine, but stupid management loves marking things as dirty. walls are thin as paper. any other complex is much better than this one alone. Users/denisefleming

20110218 10:12:37 nbsp I am posting this so there is a recent review of this place.

I rate it a 9/10. I chose this apartment because I was looking for a 2 bedroom place for two people that allowed cats and also had central AC and was close to campus. I looked at almost every complex in Davis and picked this one. I havent moved out yet so we shall see how the moveout process goes.

The Good:
1. If you are looking for a 2 bedroom, this is one of the nicest complexes you get for a lower price. Our unit is 2 bed 1 bath and we pay $1220
2.There are three buslines to choose from: F, G, J
3.Its a very short bike ride to campus, its perhaps only a mile and a straight shot down Anderson
4. Its right across the street from Savemart and a short walk to the Marketplace (Safeway)
5. There is AMPLE PARKING. I have never had a problem with parking, there is enough for all residents and you get one permit per person on the lease. My guests have always been able to find parking on Alvarado.
6. The leasesigning process was super easy: no cosigners required
7. The manager (MariJean) is super nice. Any problems weve had have been resolved promptly. We have had no experiences with rudeness.
8. Its a quiet complex
9.Its close to the green belt paths for nice walking or jogging

The Bad/Not So Good:
1. The deposit is really high. Its much higher than the other places weve looked
2. The gym is very small and feels crowded if there is anyone but you there! But youve got the ARC so its not a huge deal
3. They dont allow dogs
4. There are not washers/dryers in the unit. But, there is an onsite laundry facility.

What I like about the unit itself:
1. Its light and open. The kitchens have white cabinets, the carpeting is light and the dualpane windows let in a lot of light. Its not dark and dreary like many apartments. It seems very wellmaintained.
2. The bathroom set up is unusual. There is the counter/sink, and behind a door to your left is a tub/shower, and to your right is the toilet. I like this set up because you can take as long a shower as you want without having to worry about hogging up the restroom.
3. The heater is super efficient. We only need to run it for about 10 minutes to get our bedrooms warmed up.
4. There is a storage room. Its great for keeping the vacuum and for us the perfect spot to keep the cat box.

 Users/DianaK

20110714 21:31:55 nbsp The entire experience of living here was overshadowed by the highhanded and arrogant management, which pretty much defined the experience as very unpleasant.  This was the last apartment I lived in before starting grad school, and Id say avoid.  Its not horrible, but there are much better apartment complexes out there.  The units are pretty small for the rental rates, especially the living room/kitchen, which is bad if you like to furnish your apartment/have people over.  They dont use the Davis Model Lease.  The location is good, but its located in a neighborhood with plenty of good apartments, and honestly thats the best thing going for it.  Its not worth it to deal with the condescending management at this complex. Users/MatthewCCoker

20110803 19:39:38 nbsp Hi! Ive lived in a 2 bedroom/1 bath for almost a year and it has been a really pleasant experience! At first, the little things about the apartment like the color of the cabinets to the huge closet in the back were ignored, but as time went on, Ive grown to appreciate these little attentions to detail and have made my stay here at AS very enjoyable. As a student, I liked the quiet community atmosphere (but there are small parties on the weekend!) and the cleanliness of community amenities. The BBQ area is very convenient (no charcoal, just turn it on!) and you can reserve the nicely decorated clubhouse to host an event. The manager was open to talking about any issues that came up during the year and recognized me within several weeks of moving in! I love to cook so a nice kitchen is a must! Here, the kitchen is roomy (not like the galleylike ones at other apartments) and well maintained (new looking appliances, modern look). Locationwise, it was very central because it is close to freeway onramps and is across the street from Anderson Plaza (Quickly, pizza, supermarket). I think, for the price (~610/room), its a good option for those who have a friend or two to live with :)

The cons, though seemingly miniscule, are: big spiders around the awnings (but its not really anything they can do about it... its part of living outdoors) and hearing ambulances if you live close to the Covell side (you dont really hear cars because the complexs windows are more or less sound proof in that regard).

Despite the short list of cons, I still think AS is a good place to live in North Davis! Cheers and thanks for reading :) Users/AI

20110829 15:37:43 nbsp When I was apartment searching, I read through all of the Davis Wiki comment sections for all of the apartments I was interested in. If you dont listen to any other comments, please absorb this one: Dont live here.  Users/Anony252

20120826 16:49:37 nbsp I want to echo both the positives and negatives that others have discussed about living here.
Personally, my roommate and I were overcharged for cleaning fees (we were billed for carpeting, new paint, and general cleaning which totaled an astonishing $1,200) and I had to send two letters before someone addressed my problems. I had to threaten to take them to small claims court before I heard back from someone; after that process we got most of our money back.
The pros of this place are:
clean, affordable, spacious apartments for two people
close to the major G/J lines, as well as the F
easy access for biking to campus (dont take Anderson! Use Oak st!!)
close to the Safeway/marketplace, the Savemart/Sushi Unlimited place, and the Davis Greenbelt for walking/biking
lots of parking and street parking for people visiting
place to park your bike right outside (providing your neighbors dont use them all)

Cons:
management will constantly treat you like you are sophomores who are living on their own for the first time. Mostly annoying because my roommate and I were older and responsible. Still, worth pointing out there is a lot of hand holding for repair orders, notifications, rules, etc compared to other places
initial deposit is quite high compared to other complexes (and our moveout process was a pain)

I wouldnt live here again due to the constant barrage of things from the management, but for new apartment renters it might be a good place. Users/omnipotentdude

20130522 16:55:58 nbsp This is the worst place to live! Managers are arrogant and very rude. Management is too cheap to invest in better exercising equipments and everything looks rundown. This is the 21st century and we are still using coins for laundry machines and dryers 0_o? Such a hassle to always come see their old wrinkly faces to exchange money for laundry. It seems to be a nuisance to them when a tenant comes in to ask questions or ask for repairs. My asian roommate came in to ask about a possibility of renewing her lease for the upcoming year and the evil landlord told her to leave because she didnt schedule an appointment, and clearly they were not busy at the moment. These ladies are a bunch of arrogant, stupid, and racists people who always look down on minorities and treat their tenants like trash. I just wanted to inform you all before you guys dig a deeper hole for yourselves. Lesson learned....never choose AGGIE SQUARE APARTMENTS!!! Users/SarahBrown

20130528 15:52:01 nbsp wow what a bunch of hypersensitive people. Ive been here for three years, and the managers are perfectly friendly. Repairs are done same/next day, and rates are great given the space youre given. The kitchen and living room are huge. Yes you need quarters for the machines, big deal...welcome to life outside the dorms. No, the managers arent your parents and wont kiss your feet every time you grant them the pleasure of your company.  Users/BrianBusemeyer

20130529 15:42:16 nbsp We are surprised and confused by the above comment from SarahBrown and we suspect it may be a malicious hoax. We have searched our records back to 2005 and have no record of having a tenant by the name of Sarah Brown. We are also unaware of any situation in which someone was asked to leave.  We would like to be able to serve everyone at once, but sometimes it is not possible depending upon what is going on at the time. All of our residents are very important to us and we really try to serve everyone in a very respectful manner.
The personal attacks directed toward the staff and the absurd racistrelated comments are hurtful and completely unacceptable. We are very proud of the diversity in all the complexes that we manage and we consider that diversity an important component that contributes to a stronger community.
As far as the condition of the complex goes, the recent improvements include: new higher power WiFi antennas and overall internet system upgrade, new highefficiency laundry machines, exterior paint job, new windows, new cabinet hardware, new dining room fixtures, new energyefficient kitchen lighting, stainless steel BBQs for tenant use, etc.  Currently we are in the progress of installing new front doors and bathroom vanity light fixtures. We strive to keep the complex in good repair and work hard to meet or exceed resident expectations and our high standards. Many of these upgrades have been made based upon comments and suggestions made by our residents.
If the comment above was a joke, then you sure nailed us good! However, if this comment was made by a resident using a fake name, please come meet with us so we can attempt to resolve your anger toward us. We would hate to see you so upset over something you heard second hand and we desire the opportunity to discuss and hopefully resolve any outstanding issues. We attempt to make every effort to make Aggie Square a great place to live and we are always willing to listen to constructive comments, especially ones that may lead to community wide improvements for everyone.
