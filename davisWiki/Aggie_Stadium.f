Aggie Stadium is a multiuse sports facility home to football and womens lacrosse. It is located on 20 acres west of La Rue Road, just north of the Health Sciences Complex.

The stadium seats 10,743 and was designed to be able to expand to a capacity 30,000. It features a modern press box, the Bob Foster Team Center, a synthetic turf field, concessions, and restroom facilities. The scoreboard draws a whopping 61 kW of power, including 47 kW for a Daktronics ProStar VideoPlus LED video display, which IET Mediaworks Mediaworks Video sometimes operates during games.

For the 2007 season, all games were held during the day, as there were no stadium lights. Stadium lights were installed on May 29, 2008 and all 2008 home football games are scheduled as evening games (except the Causeway Classic, an afternoon game). According to a Dateline UC Davis http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id10402&fu053008 article, there are a total of 172 light fixtures rated at 1500 watts each and 8 rated at 2000 watts (which can operate by generator in the event of a power outage). Fortyfive lights are mounted on each of four 120 ft poles. Total, the lighting system uses 274 kW of power. The stadiums sound system is driven by a rack filled with 3 kW and 1.8 kW audio amplifiers.

The stadium is also notable because the Scooter Cop has been sighted there on multiple occasions.

Naming rights for the stadium itself are priced at $10 million and have not been sold yet.

Construction began in 2005. The first game played in the stadium was a womens lacrosse game in early 2007. It officially opened on September 1, 2007 with the 2007 Aggie football season against Western Washington University. The stadium was formally dedicated October 13, 2007.

Funding for the $31 million stadium was provided in part by the the Facilities and Campus Enhancement Initiative, a fee increase passed by students in 1999. This covered roughly twothirds of the cost, with the rest coming from private donations and campus funds.

Aggie Pack, tired of squeezing their staff into the Athletics Annex, decided to take over the press box for some extra office space sometime in 2008. Yes, they really plan on moving out before each game and moving back in afterwards.

Construction

  In reverse order, newest to oldest:


 
By Fall of 2005, ravenous construction equipment had dug a giant hole at the stadium site, presumably the size of one (1) MultiUse Stadium. It would be a sweet place to take a dirt bike.


 
On 20050124, the California Aggie reported that the UC Regents had voted to http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id7107 approve the construction of the stadium.



Does anyone know what the university is going to do about the cows over here? I cant imagine theyre going to be happy with all the added noise and traffic the stadium will bring... Users/TonyMagagna

I cant imagine spectators in the stadium are going to be too happy smelling cowdung wafting in from tercero either Users/JamesDawe

Maybe the cow smell is supposed to add to the intimidation during football games. Users/GiladGurantz
  Brings new meaning to hometown advantage. Our Aggies are used to it, whereas the visiting team will be busy holding their breath. We could station cows and pigs around the stadium during football games. This could be a significant advantage...

Supposing you dont want to live down the cow town designation...  Users/JustinCummins

20060624 15:35:32 nbsp the cows dont smell that much Users/RohiniJasavala

20070721 19:31:44 nbsp Wait, i thought this stadium WAS for the cows. There was a big descrimination lawsuit going on not too long ago, where cows complained as residents of Davis, they dont get anything near what students get. Then, they settled for a stadium. and it is taking longer than expected because cows cant come into agreement about what kind of grass to use. Some like the africa (sweeter) kind, and some like the asian (a little bitter).  Users/KevinW

20070821 12:25:57 nbsp As big and great as the stadium is supposed to be, they didnt build the press box big enough to allow KDVS sportscasters space inside... Good planning. Users/ElisaHough

20070821 12:31:35 nbsp Have they found money for lights yet? Users/JamesSchwab

20070821 14:50:58 nbsp I heard the stadium is going to be totally ecofriendly, everything sold there compostable or recyclable with receptacles for both.  No trashcans. Users/AllisonEriksen

20070821 18:28:14 nbsp The money for lights has arrived, but it came in a little to late. With only a limited number of companies that build lights and the fact they they have to be custom made and ordered, dont expect them to be up for the 2007 season. Users/ChrisPerry

20070822 10:42:06 nbsp Does anyone know why they keep watering the big field on the corner of Hutch & LaRue to encourage the weeds to grow?  I vaguely remember hearing about a fun zone but I dont know what that would be. Users/ScottWeintraub

20071027 12:22:50 nbsp do they serve beer at the games? Users/JackkiCox
 If youre a VIP, there is a lounge you can go to downstairs from the press box where you can booze it up. I dont know what kinds of booze are served nor am I certain of the cost.

20080118 03:05:42 nbsp Is there something wrong with the lights from Toomey Field that they cant be used here? Users/NickSchmalenberger
 There are two issues with using the lights from Toomey. The first is that Toomey isnt being retired. Its still used for field and track events, among other things. Toomey still needs the lights because some events still happen at night there. The second is that each one of those lights is a custom job. Sure, theyd work, but their configuration would probably be suboptimal.  Users/WilliamLewis

20080218 13:45:15 nbsp Does anyone know why a track was not included with the stadium? Users/JeremyOgul
        $$ Users/JamesSchwab
        While money may have been a serious motivation, it was also advertised that without a track the seats could be much closer to the field. Recall that at Toomey Field the temporary endzone grandstands were actually within the track oval on top of the areas used for high jump, etc during track season. Users/RyanCoates

20081005 14:28:39 nbsp My husband and I just attended a game  it was great fun and very easy to get to. Users/AcMach

20110918 18:49:19 nbsp We sat in the grassy end zone area at last nights game. Its a fairly steep incline, but a good place to the kids to run and roll around. I know its stadium food, but it was awful. The soft pretzels tasted like they had been frozen for years and barely reheated. Same for the popcorn. We decided against the severely burned hotdogs and the cheezinacan nachos. Never mind the prices. I wish a university that prides itself on food, nutrition, and sustainability could provide decent fare at the game. Users/NoelBruening

20111111 14:16:13 nbsp I love the grass seats by the endzones. We need another scoreboard though. Users/BryceH

20120526 11:15:07 nbsp Theres a certain emptiness about this place every time Ive been to an event here. The football games just havent been as lively as they were back at Toomey. Everything just feels a bit... spaced out at this place.  Users/CecilioPadilla
