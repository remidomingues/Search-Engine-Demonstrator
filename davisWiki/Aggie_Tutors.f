Tutormatcher was started in 2003 in Davis, CA under the name Aggie Tutors by Craig Shacklett, a UC Davis Sophomore. Craig had tutored a variety of students and subjects while attending high school in the bay area and had earned a reputation from local teachers as someone that could dramatically improve students’ grades and train them to become exceptional students.  Aggie Tutors still operates in the Davis region with support from Tutormatcher.

Parents loved having a young tutor/mentor that their children could look to as a role model. Referrals were pouring in and soon Craig had to start turning away potential clients. That’s when he had the idea, “if I hire friendly, likable people and train them to tutor in the same techniques that I used, there would be no limit to how many students we could help.”

Using a stringent selection process, Craig put together a staff of incredibly talented college students and trained them to be exceptional tutors. Using only wordofmouth advertising, Craig’s new tutoring service expanded to one of the most wellknown and respected in the area.
We feel that we have perfected the formula for helping our clients become the successful and ambitious students that their parents know they can be. That is why we are bringing this opportunity to your area. Take advantage of your local resources and help your child today!
