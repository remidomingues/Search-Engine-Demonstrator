Aggies Barber Shop is a Hair Salons and Barber Shops Barber shop located in Downtown Davis next to Tommy Js/Froggys. As one can see from the comments below, the establishment can be a mixed bag of good/bad haircuts and friendly/cold service, so you might want to try them out if you want a story you can trust. Prices are low to average, but there is a charge for using ones credit card.

Aggies Barber Shop offers the rare straight razor shaving service. Full face shaves are $25 (and it takes forty minutes) and only performed by the most senior staff. However, men receive complementary neck shaves after a haircut. A straight razor shave with hot lather is an enjoyable and relaxing act and the complementary neck (and possibly sideburn) shave is one of this barber shops most attractive attributes to its patrons.

Signs are posted in the shop that cell phones are not allowed on the premises (due to their disruptive nature). Some signs claim a fee of a few dollars for having a cellular phone ring during service. Although the policy is reported to be enforced by the staff, it is nearly never necessary.

Aggies Barber Shop does not take appointments for haircuts.

20050611 12:34:12 nbsp I used to frequent this place religiously because I thought they did a great job.  A year later I came back to get my haircut for an important job interview and I made sure the stylist knew that.  Afterwards my friends, and gf all told me I should go get my money back because the barber didnt listen to me at all and gave me what he though every kid in college wants, short hair all the way up to the top of your head.  Manager would NOT give me money back, and I have a job interview in 3 days and no idea what to do short of shaving my head. Users/KaVa

20050617 04:49:33 nbsp I cant always drive home to my favorite barber, so when i first moved to Davis I tried a bunch of barbers, this was my least favorite (disappointing as I enjoyed the shave). The male asian barber (kind of rotund?) cut my hair, when I got home (my mirror is close) I realized that my hair was completely lopsided. I went back the next day, and he did fix it up, but it was so lopsided I have no idea how someone with that experience could makea mistake that large. Currently am enjoying the Barbers at Davis Barber Shop Users/AlvinTsao

20050625 16:43:11 nbsp QUALITY. Top notch. I got the old lady and she gave me a hell of a cut. At the end too they lather up your neck with HOT cream and shave you oldschool with the blade and all. Ill go there again for sure. Users/MattJojola

20050826 03:04:44 nbsp Im with matty on this one. The old lady hooked me up. i had been going to the davis barber shop forever, but had a few bad expiriances. I finnaly went here and it was night and day. I cant speak for any of the other barbers but the women i had was great. i think here name was Jannene or something like that. Users/AlexEley

20051003 12:44:59 nbsp This is my standard haircut shop in Davis. The barbers are all very helpful and double check on some instructions just to make sure you understand what youre getting yourself into. Some barbers are chatty and others arent so much but its always a pleasant experience. My quick buzz cut costs $14 and although there are cheaper places, I trust this place and you cant beat the shaving cream/razor/aftershave at the end of the cut. Excellent place! Users/LiRic

20051119 16:52:41 nbsp Because of a previous good experience here with a friendly guy in his 60s, I came back for a haircut a few days before my brothers wedding.  Unfortunately, the friendly older guy wasnt there, and I ended up paying ~$14 for a muchtooshort haircut with some kind of unsolicited hair product oddly reminiscent of pig fat. The moral of this story: if your barber opens a bottle of something that smells like ham, dont let a language barrier prevent you from stopping him before he smears it on your head. Also, if your girlfriend still lets you share her pillow even though your head reeks of ham, you should marry her. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060519 10:57:54 nbsp I got the worst haircut of my life from these people. I asked for my (admittedly longish) hair to be cut about three inches overall, and for my goatee to be trimmed but left longish. The barber cutting my hair COMPLETELY ignored my instructions, gave me damn near a buzz cut, and trimmed my poor goatee out of existance. I was so angry and upset that I didnt get my hair cut again for six years. True story. I dont remember the name of the barber that did this to me, but it was an older lady who was DEFINITELY unpleasant. Users/BigDave

20060802 14:09:42 nbsp Some barbers here are better than others, I highly recomend the nice older lady by the window, she is excellent. Users/JoeRunnels

20060803 13:53:46 nbsp Be VERY specific and let your stylist know EXACTLY what you want! Users/DipanPatel

20060815 22:29:58 nbsp I hate giving away this secret, but the lady with the long blonde hair, Jeanene, gives an amazing haircut. Users/CameronMenezes

20061007 09:35:37 nbsp Janeene was my favorite, but as of 10/8/06 she no longer works there. I had Jackie (The owner) cut my hair and she did an awesome job. Users/PeterAnselmo

20061213 21:36:49 nbsp The asian guy is by far the best barber at this place.  The first time I went in I got a decent haircut and was very happy.  The second time the asian guy cut my hair and he even suggested I cut it a certain way.  It turned out great and the price here is amazing. Users/JohnHumperdinkle

20070107 11:13:59 nbsp Just visited the shop and it currently has a sign up that says they are closed on sundays. Users/BlairGoss

20070525 02:01:28 nbsp the hot shave you get with the haircut is awesome Users/StevenDaubert

20070612 08:49:26 nbsp The owner lady is a Nazi. She has had a lot of problems in her personal life and she tends to take it out on her customers. When I was there once, she turned to one of her customers and said I already have my customers. I dont need you. I dont even wanna hear you talk. so dont get into any arguments whatsoever with her. Actually, I recommend not going there at all because her employees are pretty scared of her too, and slightest comment could tick her off. I go there because of the young dude that gives really nice haircuts.  Users/KevinW

20080202 16:56:25 nbsp Got a haircut with some good scissor work all over.  Only problem is that my hair is super straight so when they cut my bangs in a straight line I looked like a goof.  They didnt really know how to accomodate that so that was definitely a negative.  Guy was youngish with dark hair, big dude, had tats.  Complementary hot shaving cream shave down is on point. Users/smacktooth

20080226 15:59:29 nbsp The Aggie Barber Shop is hit and miss, depending on the Barber. Ive been going there for 7 years now. When I was an undergrad there was a young Hispanic guy that always got it perfect and everyone would wait for him.  Currently,  Janeene is my choice.  If shes not there, then I return another day.  She was gone for awhile and they kept rotating rookie barbers that were no good except for one, Stephanie, who was awesome!  I would always request her, but then she left. I was devastated...but hey life moves on. So, heres the breakdown (take it from a regular): Janeene always gets it right.  The Asian male gets it right with short buzz cuts.  Jackie, the lady by the window, is hit and miss because she does not take her time and does not pay attention to the minor details...which makes a huge difference.  The Hispanic male is good, not great.  So, now you know. Users/lrenteria

20080315 16:30:24 nbsp Do you remember those old barbershops with good humor and conversation with your barber and friends while getting a good haircut?  Well, THIS PLACE IS NOT IT!  My daughter and I went in today so I could get a haircut and the owner got really snarky about us chatting.  Not loud or untoward, but just chatting and making jokes about my past haircuts.  They did not even have the courtesy to tell me as a customer but instead got on my daughters case.  After that experience, they lost a customer.  This is a place for the meek. Users/IanMcKinnon

20080315 16:32:59 nbsp I forgot to add, and to add insult to injury, this is one of the few place I know in Davis that adds a buck to your bill for using a credit card. Users/IanMcKinnon

20080320 09:56:03 nbsp I went here twice. The first time I had an older lady who took 45 minutes to cut my hair, then the second time I had a younger guy who kept getting distracted while cutting my hair. Nonetheless, I did not go back again. I could pay the same amount at a quick haircut place and it would only take 15 minutes of my time. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080520 14:09:56 nbsp It surprises me to hear so many unhappy comments about the shop and its owner.  Ive been going to Aggies Barber shop for ten years and have never had a bad experience.  Previously I tried the other shops in town and found them to seem to not want my business.  As for the owner, for the last year or so she is the only one that cuts my hair.  She always does an excellent job, tending to my sideburns and bushy eyebrows without me having to ask.  She is a bit on the quiet side for a barber, but Ive never had a problem having a conversation with her.   Users/JimStewart

20080609 02:51:37 nbsp I started going here when I am going to college because it is the cheapest with the highest quality. I have only had my hair cut by the Asian barber when Ive gone, and he might not be the greatest English speaker in the world but he knows what hes doing. He always makes sure my hair is just how I want it when he is finished. Then they hot lather shave your neck and sideburns then add a splash of aftershave. Just like in the good ol days. I recommend this place for anyone who doesnt want to pay $50 bucks for a dang haircut at some fancy salon  its always around $15 here  and get a quality hair cut at the same time.  Users/JeremyDutch

20081114 10:12:35 nbsp I have long curly/wavy hair.  Over the years Ive come to the conclusion that every barber I ever go to would butcher it, so might as well go with something cheap or shave it.  After reading many reviews of all the barber shops in Davis, I decided to come here.  Yesterday Thomas (Asian) gave me a hell of a hair cut, exactly what I wanted and looks really good...I am very pleased with the results, and it was fairly quick and only.  Their rates are usually $13$15 but I guess because Ive got curly hair they charged me $20, but I dont care cause Im happy with it. Users/Joeprunc

20081117 18:33:45 nbsp Thanks for completely disregarding what I asked for, deciding my all my hair needed to be cut off because its curly, and then doing it without asking if that would be ok. Really, worst haircut Ive had in a long time. Im a diehard tipper, but I had to stiff them on this one. Users/NickP

20090204 17:44:35 nbsp Man that straight razor is awesome, I just got another solid cut today. Dyan was behind the sheers, and I will return Users/StevenDaubert

20090213 17:36:45 nbsp Barbers to me are kind of like Dental Hygienists.  I fear both but only think about changing when either I have a very negative experience or when Im forced to see someone other than my usual decent person.

Ive had experiences with a few of the current barbers at Aggies Barber Shop and have come to the conclusion that Thomas (the asian) is the only guy I can trust insofar as hes consistent (though he cuts a little shorter than Id like in front).  The other barbers pay less attention to detail (sometimes carelessly so) and my only experience with the lady close to the window (owner?) was that she used the clippers to really take out her aggression on my scalp.  Now, I wait for anyone but her (even if shes free and none of the others are)  thats how much it stuck with me.

Needing haircuts the past time or two and not finding Thomas there, I tried others and was disappointed.  Im still looking for the one who just gets it 95100% right.  But I must admit, Im sheepish about correcting barbers, so Im likely just as culpable for the outcome too. Users/BrettCoder

20090221 14:18:52 nbsp Got my first haircut in Davis here today. I must say Im impressed. I went in with basically no clear idea of what I wanted my hair to look like other than shorter and Dyan basically took care of it. Before she finished up with the straight shave (which every guy knows is awesome if hes ever had one), she asked how I liked the haircut. I felt the front was still a little long and she agreed and shortened it up for me. Good oldschool barber shop atmosphere and a decent price ($15 for me since she used scissors; I believe its $13 for clippers). Im a rather quiet person and I loathe small talk so Im happy that she didnt force any conversation about the weather or anything like that. She did, however, inquire enough to find out that Im a freshman and gave me a freshman freebie. Its a little booklet with different types and colors of sticky notes  quite a nice gesture if you ask me. I usually like to try new places and things but I think Ill just return here next time I need a haircut.  Users/kennethlyons

20091005 20:22:36 nbsp i am not happy with my haircut, one side of the fade is more curved while the other is straight up and on top it is lopsided....... Users/aznstryder712

20100424 22:47:29 nbsp Very nice place to get a cut.  I am very picky about how I get my haircut  I want a high and tight flattop, and many people dont seem to be able to do it correctly.  Dyan  made sure that not only was the top equally cut, but she spent a lot of time making sure that my requirements were met  and she did not disappoint.  Was very pleased with the shaving portion as well  this was a REAL barber shop experience for myself.  Will definitely go back. Users/Kacarab

20100708 16:08:51 nbsp Great quality! Great customer service. Detail oriented. Have been going here for the last 12yrs, never a bad experience. Have to agree, the HOT cream and oldschool blade are the best!! Users/ilmlopez

20100708 19:07:10 nbsp Thinking about letting the scraggly chin/facial hair grow back a bit just so I can get another straight razor shave here... Similar to a facial for women, its a bit of mana from heaven for men. Users/WesOne

20110502 20:30:39 nbsp took my son there last week to get a hair cut, I ask the guy working there if he was good with cutting long hair. He said yes no problem. but I asked him again he said yes very good, i cut with scissors end result. he had NO IDEA how to cut hair with scissors. maybe he is good with buzzcuts. but dont go here if you want any kind of stylish cut.

20110510 18:49:23 nbsp Lets just say this is my second time setting my foot upon this shop and I will never be back again. The owner was a rude bee and ignored me for a while and when she finally acknowledged my existence she got snarky and said in a condescending tone, What do you want?. I told her I needed a trim and she rudely told me to wait. Still standing, I asked her where do I sit, in one of the hair cutting chairs or the waiting room. And again, she got very rude and simply told me to wait out there. I sat down for a second, very humiliated, got up and left. Never will I be back here, the lady was an old hag that shouldnt be running a business. The only reason I came back here was because one of her other employees did an okay job and as a college student it was a convenient place to go. Users/NoelleSanders

20110530 00:15:03 nbsp I think that this is the best barber shop in Davis and one of the best I have ever found.  The owner ensures that all of the barbers know what they are doing.  Shes a very nice person and has bent oer backwards to accomodate her barbers.  She also has provided an opportunity to step back in time.  When I walk in, I feel like I have been transported back to the 50s or 60s with the interesting decor.

Most importantly, Ive always gotten a good haircut at a good price.

20111122 12:17:03 nbsp                         SUCKS hard and RUDE barber.

This is my first visit, so there might be some communication problem, so the barber dont actually understand what hair cut I want. So he gave me an unwanted hair cut. If at this moment, I have not asked for change it for a better hair cut, it would be much better now. But I asked, then he changed the hair cut, and it is even for worse. Even at this moment, I am just unsatisfied, not so unhappy about this barber. When I said I am unsatisfied with the hair cut, the barber got really angry, and he even said that I am giving him much trouble. Even his every move is like with anger, I was kinda worried whether he will hit me.. and I felt really unwelcomed in this shop.

One way to ruin peoples lives is to ruin their hair,
If you want to commit suicide,
come to this shop.
Satisfaction Guaranteed.

20120206 11:04:33 nbsp Great quality for such an affordable price.  Got my longish hair trimmed down nice and neat, and the hot lathered straight razor at the end seals the deal.  So far, have had only the Asian lady cut my hair there, but she did an excellent job.  This cost less than a hair cut in my hometown, and this is Davis too.  Overall, highly recommended. Users/MitchDavis

20120615 20:51:30 nbsp I really wish I could say I had a good experience here, but I just cant. The barber was a nice guy but certain things just made it unpleasant. For starters, after I sat down and told him what I wanted done, he belched right in my ear. I know its a natural human function but no effort was made to cover the sound...or smell. Second, he asked if I wanted him to trim my beard and I said no. He then proceeded to trim the sides of my beard. One one hand cool, on the other I clearly said no. Finally, I wish he would have asked if I wanted the hot cream shave everyone raves about, because I would have said no but he did it anyway. At first, it was nice. The foam was warm and felt kind of good, but it also felt off. I didnt realize until I left that the reason it felt off was because he cut my neck several times with his straight razor. Others who saw it seemed quite shocked by the cuts so they must have been worse than I could tell. I didnt move because I was nervous of the blade, so the excuse that I moved causing the cuts wouldnt apply. The haircut itself wasnt anything spectacular either but I still paid $15 and tipped him well. Looking back I regret this visit and I wont be returning. Users/DanielCordova

20121206 23:46:53 nbsp After being a regular customer for 2+ years, I will not be coming here anymore.  My last two experiences here were subpar in both service and respect, which is very aggravating for a regular (and one who always tips extremely well).  I would hope that the staff understands that my time is just as precious as theirs.  The last time I came in for a haircut, I waited for about 45 minutes before I could see my barber (and, she was the only one working at the time anyway, so preference is irrelevant in this case).  When its due time for me to come up and get my hair cut, one of the senior staff, Thomas, tells my barber that she must take her break.  She tells him that she can quickly cut my hair and that it would be no problem, but he insisted that she take her break.  I have no problem with employees being required to take breaks after working for so many hours; what I DO have a problem with is how he told her: You need to take a break; he can wait, its fine.  I was really irked to hear this, but after waiting for as long as I did, I might as well have sucked it up and waited some more. Yes, after waiting 45 minutes, I had to wait another 20 or so before I could get my haircut.  It wouldnt have been so bad had he offered to cut my hair instead, but of course, he took another client as he told her this, so I had to keep on waiting.

It was apparent that she did hurry with her break, and she did get ready for me quickly.  Unfortunately, she did a rushed job on my hair, and it wasnt what I had told her what I wanted; parts of my hair were uneven too, and I didnt notice this until AFTER I left their shop.  I may have waited an hour to get my hair cut, but when it comes to my hair actually being cut, I can stand to wait another hour, as long as the job is done the way I asked.  As much as I liked the shave at the end, I will be on the hunt for a new place to be a regular.   Users/Kacarab
