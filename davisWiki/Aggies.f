Students at UC Davis are often called Aggies because of the Schools schools College of Agriculture agricultural reputation, though the official mascot is a mustang named Gunrock. As a result, many businesses around town have the word Aggie in their name (e.g. Aggie Inn, Aggie Square, Aggie Nails, etc). The name of the UC Davis newspaper is The California Aggie, also commonly called The Aggie by students.

From the UC Davis News & Notes, 1997: STUDENTS SAY NEIGH TO MUSTANG

A cows cow? A mustang? An Aggie? You might say that the UC Davis mascot has had an identity crisis of late. But now a group of students is attempting to remedy that.

A student body vote on a referendum in February 1997 declared the Aggie the winner ....
Adding to the confusion was a student vote taken in 1993 that, by a slim margin, named the cow as mascot. And while apparently there is no official policy specifying how to go about changing the universitys mascot, a lack of administrative and alumni approval of the cow design left the matter languishing without any consensus.

....
The name Aggie does, indeed, have a long history at UC Davis. A 1922 editorial in the University Farm Agricola, predecessor to The California Aggie, said, Up till now our men here have been known as the Davis Farmers. In practically all the agricultural colleges of the United States, Aggies is the name used. . . . The name has a college air, a football air, about it. . . . Lets call ourselves the Aggies. Hasnt it a winning sound to it? A few years later, the mustanginspired by a famous Thoroughbred stallion named Gunrockwas adopted as the symbol for UC Davis athletic teams and used interchangeably with Aggie.

Of the nearly 3,000 students voting .... 75 percent called for the Aggie to replace the mustang.....

Students at http://www.tamu.edu/ Texas A&M University and http://www.usu.edu/ Utah State University are also notable Aggies among the 24 US schools who use the name (or at least those who are listed on wiki:wikipedia:Aggie Wikipedia).
