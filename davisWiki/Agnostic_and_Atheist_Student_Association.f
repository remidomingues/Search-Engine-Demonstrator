The Agnostic and Atheist Student Association, or AgASA is a Student organizations campus organization with the purpose of fostering a community for the many agnostics, secularists, skeptics, and atheists at UC Davis. AgASA’s ideal community is inclusive: atheists, agnostics, and others of goodwill who would like to join. AgASA conducts a variety of activities, including social events, community service, regular meetings, and fundraisers, with the following goals:

 To generate opportunities to meet people and build friendships both within AgASA and with others in the broader UCD community.
 To provide a safe environment for atheists, agnostics, and others to share ideas and concerns.
 To promote collaboration for good works and activism to serve the disadvantaged and the oppressed.
 To promote a favorable public image of atheists and agnostics, and public awareness and understanding of legal and cultural issues of significance to atheists and agnostics.

AgASA is not devoted to any particular school of thought. The group serves primarily as a meeting place for people who identify, for one reason or another, as atheists or agnostics. The meetings are discussion based and the organization has no agenda. What the group focuses on is a function of what the present individuals discuss. This is an important part of how AgASA functions.

There is currently no process for official membership in the Agnostic and Atheist Student Association. Generally those who consider themselves members are either members of AgASAs http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200395326 facebook group or regularly attend the meetings. The meetings are open to the campus, community, and beyond.

History


AgASA was formed in the Fall of 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, as a response to what was perceived as very aggressive and deceptive marketing on the part of some of the Christianity Christian organizations on campus. The group was founded by three people, all of whom have now moved out of Davis and on to other things.  Founder, Bryce Kuklok, class of 2004, designed the official logo of AgASA to be a Jesus fish on a plate ready to be eaten. His reasoning in starting the organization was that there were no fewer than a dozen religious organizations present on what was supposed to be a secular public campus, yet there was no outlet for the godless, who were bombarded on a daily basis by the rhetoric and propaganda of faith based groups.  The original intended name of AgASA was Aggie Agnostics, but in a move inconsistent with the reality of other student groups present on campus, Bryce was barred from using the term Aggie.

The groups former president was Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke, who aspired to restart the club several times during the 20022003 school year.  In the midwinter quarter of 2005, Kris held a meeting and people actually showed up and were interested in getting AgASA going again!  After officer elections and official affiliation with larger Agnostic and Atheist groups (such as http://www.secularstudents.org Secular Student Alliance and http://www.rthoughtsrfree.org/aof.htm Atheists and Other Freethinkers), the new board is excited to start having fun and meeting new agnostics and atheists hidden in the Davis community. Arash Khosrowshahi was a former Student Advisor.

See, e.g., http://history.vineyard.net/pledge.htm The Pledge of Allegiance  A Short History. I make this comment because of the above rally, which says we need to remove the phrase under God from the Pledge.  I think it would be more accurate to say that some would like to see the U.S. restore the pledge to its original, preCommunistparanoia, separationof churchandstate version.  Users/CovertProfessor

20080709 15:30:10 nbsp I think its a great idea to trumpet the successes of atheists and agnostics, but what about pointing out that none of the wars, genocides, or other terrors perpetrated throughout history have ever had an atheist at the helm. Stalins massacres are the only exception I can think of. Users/ArthurFrane
          I think you are right about Stalin. Im hard pressed to come up with another example.  Also, I think I read somewhere that athiests comprise something like less than 1% of the convicts on Death Row.  Have you ever noticed that all these rapists, murderers, child molesters, etc. all purport to have found Jesus and are all religious now?  They always do that thing where they proclaim that they were lost and saved by the Loooooord!  Somehow, I always find this ironic. Users/CurlyGirl26
          I certainly agree that there are many wars, genocides, murders, etc done either as justified by religion (e.g. several current conflicts in the middle east and Africa) or instigated under other pretenses by people who are overtly religious (e.g. the current Iraq war), it cannot be said that atheists have never caused war or committed genocide.  All Communist regimes are explicitly athiest and often antagonistic to religion.  Thus, it is not only Stalin, but all Soviet, N. Korean, and http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/geneva/chinareligionstate.htm Chinese actions are done by athiests.  Tibetans would probably want to be added to the list of those oppressed by Atheists.  Pol Pot, dictator of Cambodia and instigator of a million dead, was antireligion and would probably be an athiest if I bothered to investigate enough to confirm that.  Several other dictators almost certainly are, as well.  Several members of the atomic bomb Manhattan Project were agnostic or atheist, whether the bomb is evil or not is debatable, but it certainly has become mixed up in religion since.     It is still unquestionably true that religion has caused much suffering, and the religious are often willing to harm others more than their religion should allow.  Although agnostics/atheists would probably be better on average, being areligious doesnt mean that person will not commit atrocities  Users/NotTires
          The Wikipedia article on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism state atheism has several examples of what I call atheist theocracies. For example, Pol Pots regime killed religious people and destroyed Buddhist temples and artifacts. Muslims were forced to eat pork. Et cetera. All the horrible atrocities common to theocracies — repression of the freedoms of conscience, thought, speech, assembly, press, religion, nonreligion — have occurred in officially atheist nations. This is why I value the ideal of a secular state, a government that diligently works to makes sure that it does not favor, promote, or in any shape or form exert the slightest pressure supporting or opposing any religion or nonreligion (Teaching evolution does not count because it is a theory composed of a set of logical postulates supported by mountains of evidence. Teaching that the lack of evidence for god means that people should become atheists does count because it is nothing else other than an antireligious attack.) Users/RaymondCrawford

20090519 00:13:44  nbsp Just curious: did the artist create the AGASA logo (pictured at the top right of this page) on a Friday? Users/SolidSender

20090523 17:07:40 nbsp SolidSender, I dont think many of the current AgASA members have much of an idea who created that logo, much less which day of the week it was created on. But what we do know is that it was very tongue in cheek. We now have a new logo. Ill work on uploading it now. Users/Shiva
  I was one of the charter members (20012002 school year). While I do not recall the name of the original designer, I do remember that the original banner bearing the logo was in the possession of Bryce Kuklok, one of the original officers of AGASA, for quite some time. It may very well have been his design, or that of either Casey Davis or Margaret Lewis, also original officers. I also do not recall what day of the week it was completed, but I can confirm that it was indeed meant to be tongue in cheek.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

20090524 10:45:23 nbsp We still have the original banner. That things an antique... Users/Shiva
   Just was wondering if the artist who created the logo is a lapsed Catholic, since, you know, they are only allowed to eat fish on otherwise meatless Fridays. Whether they do the other days of the week would perhaps depend on the quality of the cuisine in the restaurants featuring Friday Fish Specials for the penitents. Users/SolidSender
      (Note: the above comment was somewhat corrected since this reply was made) You have it backwards.  Roman Catholic tradition forbids the eating of meat on Fridays, and fish are an exception (they, along with rabbit meat, are not considered meat for the purpose of the observation).  Thats why the soup of the day is usually clam chowder on Friday and there are so many Friday fish specials (especially where there is a heavy Catholic population).  It is a tradition rather than edict; the idea is to observe some kind of penance, and the definition now lies in the locales Episcopal Conference.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, who isnt Catholic, but thinks cultural traditions are interesting.
   Definitely food for thought, Jabberwokky. But why do the Episcopals have anything to do with Catholic diets? Users/SolidSender
     They dont.  An Episcopal Conference is the name of all the Bishops in a given area within the Roman Catholic Church.  In some respects they are similar to the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodox, except of course, Papal Decree always wins.  Honestly, if youre interested in this kind of stuff (meaning AASA), its worth learning about these organizations just because youll come to realize they are outgrowths of tribes, nations and empires, often motivated by things similar to what motivates todays secular political and volunteer organizations.  Of course, Im a history buff, so I kind of come at it from that direction.  jw
     Also, it occurred to me theres a possibility some people might not recognize that as an http://www.google.com/search?qIchthys Ichthys, which is why the AASA emblem always bothered me: defining agnosticism and atheism as contrary (dining on) or even in any way related to a Christan emblem seems to demean and belittle agnostics and atheists.  It also either excludes Christian agnostics (and to a certain extent all theist agnostics) or implies that the group is devoted to Christian agnosticism.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
     Well, if they put up the logo, that simply shows, perhaps, their shortsightedness in interpreting the logo. Ive seen fish with the word Darwin squeezed inside the sketched body, as if consumed. Perhaps this logo is an elaboration in that symbolic direction in reverse? Users/SolidSender
          I think you might miss my point.  It is that they are defining their group by a purported relationship to a particular religion rather than the quite excellent body of agnostic and atheistic works, most of which have nothing to do with that religion.  Its a bit like a roleplaying club creating a logo of a deflated football.  Okay, sure... many roleplayers might dislike football, but there is some overlap (a la Christian agnosticism), and youre now defining yourself as being a group merely opposed to a particular facet of something that is not really in direct opposition.  Plus, theyre merely selecting the flavor (sport or religion) that happens to be popular locally and at this period in history.  It assumes an opposition which is antagonistic, and that rubs me the same way as the preachers with signs: Your ideas are stupid, and I am not only right, I am invoking an image (hell, consumption of your icon of belief) that I will win in the end.  There is no symbol here of the beliefs of the group, just a symbol of this other team in our hometown is wrong, and they are going to lose to us. jw
          Your observation is relevant to group when it was founded but doesnt reflect the groups current members, meetings and activities. The current logo expresses dissatisfaction with religion in a much broader sense. Users/ScottMorgan
             And again, it is still implying that the clubs identity is defined by religion.  Is this an antireligion club or a proagnosticism and atheism club?  The new icon still identifies the group by the relationship to religion, and makes it look like the club is solely a conversion effort to save the believers with no interest in the actual subject of agnostic or atheistic ideas.   jw
   jw: very interesting to follow your thinking in response to my comment above. I was making a little fun taking the image of a fish on a plate flanked by knife and fork literally. (and then the fish having digested DARWIN, which is definitely food for thought:)  But youve gone much further, placing the intent of the the poster/creator of that image in a political context: namely how it symbolizes an attitude of Us vs. Them. Which plays into the whole long sorry history of religious strife. I would have thought atheists or agnostics would have been more of independent thinkers, without depending for definition of their movement by others which its members declare they are against. I also agree that the new logo continues the Us vs. Them paradigm. Users/SolidSender

20090530 01:05:36 nbsp Looking at the history section of this page, it appears that the group was created as a response to the evangelical groups on campus.  In that sense, the groups identity and (current?) mission appear to be defined as a counterpoint to the campus religious groups.  In that context, it seems like a logo that shows the group as an alternative to the campus religious groups is appropriate for it.  The old logo also makes sense, since the groups that evangelize on campus are virtually all Christian groups. Users/IDoNotExist
     Yes.  Which would define this group not as an group devoted to agnostic and atheist schools of thought (which would span certain religious schools), but as atheistagnostics and atheists against religion, which is a very different group.  To go back to the example above, the difference between a roleplaying group that focuses on playing roleplaying games versus nonsports fan roleplayers against football, who focus on trying to eliminate football.  Im just curious as to which it is... theres a big difference between identifying yourself as a group who is prosomething and focuses on it (and there is certainly a very wide set of excellent agnostic and atheist philosophies, writings and speakers to explore) versus a group that is antianother group and focuses on combating them.  The title of the group seems to imply the former, the logo the latter, and that split is what Ive been wondering about since the beginning of this (now long) thread.  What is this group? jw
   The Unitarians, the majority of whom are atheist and agnostic, pride themselves on inclusiveness and openmindedness. No matter what a potential members backgroundAtheist, Agnostic, Pagan, Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or any other denomination, or nondenominationthe Unitarian Church opens its doors for the purposes of questioning and discussion. The idea, as far as I understand it, after having attended some discussions and heard a few lectures out at their church on Patwin Road in far West Davis, is selfdiscovery. They seem to be so pro that theres not much time left over for anti Users/SolidSender
   Im in no way an expert on this.  But if someone is an atheist or agnostic (especially atheist), it does seem a little bit strange to me that they would want to go to a church, since that would imply some sort of religious belief.  (It is my understanding that Unitarians are following a religion or some sort of religious belief system  correct me if Im wrong.)  But the definition of an atheist is someone who believes that there is no god.  So why would they go to a church?  In response to Jabberwockys question, Im wondering if there is actually an atheist school of thought.  The label atheist applies to anyone who does not believe in a deity by definition.  Thats a lot of people, and they surely dont all believe in the same thing (to do so would be more of a religion!), other than the lack of a deity.  To use your previous analogy, this would be more like a group of nonfootball players, some of whom dont care whether or not anyone else plays football, some of whom played football in the past and then decided that they didnt like the game, and some of whom would really prefer it if football didnt exist at all.  Of those, some might be role players and others might not, but there wouldnt be a uniform urge to role play among the nonfootball fans.  :)   Users/IDoNotExist
         You seem to not quite understand the distinctions between atheist, agnostic, theist and deist and how they relate and overlap.  The fact that there are a large number of religious agnostics, not to mention nontheist churches like Christian atheism and many other similar philosophies, gives a reason to have a group that discusses such schools of thought.  The fact that you are unaware of them pretty much shows that there is a probably a need for a proagnostic/atheist group that focuses on these subjects, educating people who are interested in these very deep subjects and the many forms of agnostic and atheistic thought.  These topics have many excellent writings dating back centuries and also contemporary authors and speakers who are available to come to campus should a group like this one work on inviting them.  The other option is for such a group to focus on countering theist and deist thought... the antagonistic, oppositional posture that also tends to exclude many people who would fit into the group were it simply proagnostic/atheist.  My question is if they have such a posture as their symbolism and history seems to imply, or if they are focused on their own subject (and thus include the full range of agnostic and atheist thought).  It is very simple: are they, as a group, proagnostic/atheist or antireligion?  Since there is a major difference between the two, not to mention quite a large number of schools of thought that fall into the overlap and are excluded in one case but not the other  plus the large number of people who are simply antireligion with no interest in actual atheism or agnosticism  it is a fairly interesting distinction. jw


20090530 10:40:27 nbsp Could it not be both simultaneously?  Although Im not sure that it would have to be against another group to have the objective of countering the objectives of that other group. Users/IDoNotExist

20090602 17:50:31 nbsp jw
Your observation about the current and former logo is correct in that it refers to religion. I myself wasnt very happy about that when we were sketching and discussing new logos, but this is what the majority voted on, so this is what it is.
That being said, I wouldnt use the logo to try and decipher the purpose and intentions of the group because thats not what the logo was created to do anyway. Its just meant to serve as a visual representation of what most of us currently feel, but it certainly is not a definition for the group, and it can always be changed just like the last one was. To refer to your questions, we are not devoted to any school of thought. AgASA serves primarily as a meeting place for people who identify, for one reason or another, as atheists or agnostics. The meetings are discussionbased and there is no agenda in our organization. In this sense its not possible to say what AgASA is about because anything goes. If AgASA were some sort of atheist activist or atheist educational group it would ceratinly be worth critisizing that true atheistic thought is so often overshadowed by or confused with antitheism  the distinction you pointed out regarding being antireligion versus being atheist is valid. But since AgASA has no central mission it can only reflect what the members put into it at any given time. The fact that atheism is heavily involved with theism is a phenomenon that currently spans beyond AgASA. That is what the socalled atheist world revolves around right now, for better or for worse. But the point I want to emphasize very strongly is that if AgASA isnt focused on true atheistic schools of thought or on religious agnosticism, thats only because theres no one at the meetings talking about those things. But talking about it is as easy as showing up. Thats how AgASA works. Im definitely willing to discuss this further.

    Excellent reply!  Its detailed, honest and from an active member of the group, which is what I was hoping for.  Id be suspect if there were any claim that a agnostic/atheist student group at any US college didnt have at least a segment of antitheists, and its not really a big deal; I was just wondering if there was any actual discussion of agnostic and atheist concepts (or at least the opportunity for such).  Im really glad the organization (at least in you) seems to recognize the greater picture, and if the functional truth is that the discussions seem to run in certain patterns, well, thats where the interest happens to lie.  I was kind of getting an odd vibe from the iconography juxtaposed with the aims of the group, which is why I was hoping somebody from the group itself would answer my questions.  It would be great if you could take your reply and rewrite it a bit and put it up into the top of the entry.  It explains what the general mindset is in direct terms (the current writeup is a bit wishywashy, probably to avoid complaint) and what to expect at a meeting, items that are very useful for both prospective members and also as a historical record to look back in a couple years at how the group has evolved.  In short, you made clear the realities of the group, something that was frustrating me about the current writeup.  Thanks again for taking the time to answer.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
   A rewrite is a good idea for the historical record, if only to clarify what members of the group feel about their logo. Itto someone happening by this DavisWiki pagecould appear at first glance to send an antagonistic message different from the clarification Shiva gives. Users/SolidSender

20090729 10:51:50 nbsp Atheists and Gnostics are right in most of their thinking

It has been common among religious believers to look with misgiving to atheists and Gnostics, and to think that they are mistaken; however, in many instances the opposite is the truth; some religious beliefs are not just irrelevant, but baseless. The “God” of main line traditions simply does not exist. I accepted the challenge of finding the One who may be recognized even by Gnostics and atheists: the Existence itself, “AllThatIs.” If something is there, that is God. Look at the book “Christianity Reformed From ist Roots  A life centered in God” (Amazon.com). I am confident that some of your friends will be relieved of the illusion, as I did myself.

20090927 12:37:59 nbsp My hero, Ayn Rand was an atheist. Shes a famous author and proponent of objectivism. 

Your hero suggest that selfishness is a virtue. Not only that but that altruism is counter to reason.  Users/upisdown

20090928 11:21:40 nbsp Do you have a comment about that or have you somehow countered that just by repeating it? Users/Shiva

           I assumed that believing selfishness was a virtue was absurd enough to speak for itself. Altruism was naturally selected into humans so it must be at the very least somewhat beneficial so the burden of proof that it isnt lies on Rand supporters. It is a pretty short sighted ideology and most proponents havent really thought it out (Much like religious people and their logically contradictory religions) because libertarianism put to any scrutiny falls apart rather quickly. Unregulated capitalism tends towards monopolies (There are several historic examples) which results in unchecked power.  If you want to defend libertarianism I would be happy to have a nice and friendly debate over it.   Users/upisdown

20091004 00:45:17 nbsp No, it doesnt necessarily speak for itself. Im not a libertarian and would do a disservice to both sides of the argument if I were to try and defend libertarianism. Furthermore, Rand wasnt a libertarian, but I dont necessarily wish to defend her either. What I will say is that I have read some of her work and much of it makes sense. Rands idea that selfishness is a virtue is exactly the argument that you cant really love someone until you love yourself; that you arent really giving anybody anything unless you assign value to yourself first, and she elaboreates on this quite clearly. Most people would agree with that notion and often do. But just because Rand literally calls it selfishness, people run with the connotation that implies she believes selfindulgence and disregard are virtues (which she does not), and in my experience, most people who attribute her to this philosophy have never read her work. Rands position on altruism is also very understandable. Capitalism isnt the only thing susceptible to corruption. Where there is altruism there is often abuse  just look at religion! Overall Im not terribly interested in this debate because I dont have any burden of proof over my personal convictions and owe nobody an explanation. Like I said, Im not here to defend Ayn Rand completely, but shes not as crazy or shortsighted as you think, and neither am I. Cheers. Users/Shiva

    It is my understanding that the definitions for selfishness and altruism used by Rand were simply misused or twisted to fit her argument. For example the the concept of altruism under her definition was not practiced or supported by any major moral philosopher. Here are some quotes of her twisted version of altruism.

The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence, and that selfsacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value. (Lexicon, p. 4)

The irreducible primary of altruism ... is selfsacrifice – ... which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good. (Lexicon, p. 5)

Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, and any action taken for ones own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of an action is the only criterion of moral value – and so long as that beneficiary is anybody other than oneself, anything goes. (Lexicon, p. 5, emphasis on any, only and anything added)

Altruism holds death as its ultimate goal and standard of value. (Lexicon, p. 7)

Rand has created a doctrine of altruism to be at odds with her egotism and naturally knocking down this strawman makes egoism look good. However to be an alternative to egoism altruism has to be an ethical theory however that is not true. The term altruism simply labels practices, dispositions or motivations recommended by different ethical theories as appropriate for certain kinds of occasions. Altruism is not more of an ethical theory than is courage.

Rands concept of altruism was entirely made up. It was a doctrine that was not held by any major moral thinker at the time and specifically the people she claimed were proponents of alturism such as Marx, Kant, Rawls, Mill, Spencer or Dewey. Not a single one maintained that that the interest of the individual are of NO importance, that service to others is the only justification for existence or that anything goes as long as one is benfitting other people than themselves.

Ironically even though Rand is a atheist she made a flimsy teleological argument for the reason selfishness was a virtue (a humans own life is the standard of value). These were based of outdated biological principals. Since this is the purpose of humans she supposes that there are no conflicts among rational people in a rational society which is wrong. But why does she suppose this clearly absurd argument?

I think the core of the answer can be found in the observation that if there are any genuine conflicts of interest, then her commitment to egoism would require her to endorse the violation of the rights that she also favors. Or, conversely, her commitment to rights would require her to endorse someone’s acting against his own interests.

Understandably, Rand did not want to be caught on either side of this trouble and so denied the premise that there was ever any conflict of rational interests. By denying it she could maintain both that each person should always serve his own interests and that rights should never be violated. Or so, at least, it appears.

Nonetheless, the claim that rational interests never conflict is pretty obviously false. Moreover, I think most Objectivists recognize that it is false. They show this by their willingness to interpret what Rand said about the lack of conflict between rational interests as true in context? – where the context is normal, nonemergency situations. What they say is that rational interests never conflict except in emergencies.

This, however, is not helpful unless there is some independent way of determining that some situation is an emergency apart from the fact that rational interests conflict there. Without that, the claim that rational interests never conflict except in emergencies just reduces to the claim that rational interests never conflict except when they do. True, no doubt, but not enlightening.

I dont think she was exactly saying what Buddhist preach that one must love themselves to love others (which is based on entirely different principals). In fact I dont think she was ever exactly saying anything considering how contradictory her definitions are. I think she was speculating a utopian reality in which everyone acted rationally (in their own self interest) and magically no one would have conflict with one another.

I have issue linking altruism with religion. I feel there is no inherent link between religion and altruism. In fact altruism is one the redeeming qualities of religion when it is actually practiced and it certainly does not have a monopoly on it.

(Unregulated) Capitalism is certainly not the only thing susceptible to corruption however nor did I say it was in my argument. This was a strawman.

As for libertarianism, while she may not have started libertarianism her work is most definitely used to support it. It is closely tied to libertarianism and the conservative movement such as Jesus (or his writers) is to Christianity. While Jesus may not have been a Christian his works played a major role in the movement. Often libertarians support her arguments without knowing what its contents are so I feel the critique of libertarianism is relevant and necessary. And I believe with this argument I can say both Ayn Rand and Libertarianism are crazy and short sighted. I try to avoid logical fallacies, ad homs in debating but I apologize if any slipped. I never intended to call or suggest you are short sighted or crazy. Users/upisdown

20091024 12:59:05 nbsp I was able to relate to a lot of what Rand said because I had the experience of living in a society that was almost identical to the one she criticized. She grew up in one, too, in Russia, and I grew up in it in Iran, and maybe thats what it takes to realize that the altruism that she criticizes is not a philosophical construct that never existed, but a reality for many people. This is how I enjoy her work, and in no other sense, so I cant disagree with or argue with any of the things youve written because thats not my perspective or approach toward her work. What I will point out, though, is that judging by how much youve written, apparently your initial argument didnt speak for itself as much as youd assumed, and that was what I was trying to get at in the first place. I was just hoping you would back up your argument. Thanks for doing that. Users/Shiva

20100314 22:37:02 nbsp Has anyone thought about boycotting overtly religious corporations who donate to pro religious policies and leaders? It seems that if you want to effectively have a voice and ever hope to have an openly atheist president we need to avoid giving money to people who think that being an atheist should precluded from politics. If we let Republican and Religious people staff courts we effectively lose any hope of appealing to the rationality of our system.

Examples are Hilton Hotel(Donated a lot of money to prop 8 supporters), In N Out (Look at bottom of the soda cup and political contributions), Woodstock pizza (Bottom of the box and they are kinda phony since they have a the same insert area special for every different UC location.) I sure with some thought and research a great list could be created. If people actually follow the boycott it effectively stops cashflow into religious control and directs it to rational people.

We live in a capitalism more importantly than a representative republic so every dollar you spend you are voting so why vote against your own interest?

Just a thought. Users/upisdown

20100409 06:51:18 nbsp As this page is in the #1 listing  Agnostic & Atheist  on the Spiritual Organizations page it prompts the question of why Agnostic and Atheists is considered spiritual since a significant portion of its participants dont consider themselves spiritual. Would perhaps Spiritual Related be a better category?  (Also are all churches spiritual?) Users/BruceHansen

20100513 14:01:15 nbsp Well, its kind of our own fault, Bruce. Where would you categorize NonOliveOilEaters but under Olive Oil? Thats kind of a joke...In the Center for Student Involvement organization list were listed under religious. I guess we cant ask for our own category, but I wonder where the philosophy club is categorized. Maybe there should be an ideology category... Users/Shiva
