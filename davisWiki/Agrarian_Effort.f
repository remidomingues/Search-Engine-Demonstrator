Agrarian Effort, or Ag Effort for short, is one of three On Campus Coops. It features a large organic Gardening garden behind the house which grows things like produce, native plants and flowers. They also vegetarian options dont eat meat and love to compost. The Coop is owned by Student Housing, but run by students. The rent is fairly inexpensive, but members are responsible for household and gardening chores. If youre interested in joining the coop, you should stop by for dinner some time, served at 7 pm, Sunday through Thursday.

Ag Effort was founded in 1969 when UCD offered the 4 houses which are now the On Campus Coops and The House to student clubs. These craftsman style houses were originally located on A street and inhabited by professors, but were moved to make room for new construction on the east side of campus.

The student club Agrarian Action was given Temporary Building 15 and over an acre of land to use. The Student Housing office was built on a significant portion of the clubs land in the early 1990s, but nearly 2/3 of an acre are still used as organic gardens by the On Campus Coops Tri Coop community.

Coop members were instrumental in founding several local institutions including the Davis Farmers Market, the Sunwise Coop, SCHA, and the Davis Food Coop.


Its my understanding that it was Davis Student Coop that started Sunwise. This should probably go on their pageUsers/ColinWalsh
  Its possible that the divisions among residents of TriCoops were just as rigid then as now ;^) So, DSC should get credit, but perhaps not to the exclusion of any for Ag Effort. Users/DougWalter
