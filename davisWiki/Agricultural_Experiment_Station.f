The Agricultural Experiment Station is not a specific place, as the name might imply. It is a program of UC Agriculture and Natural Resources that employs researchers from UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and UC Riverside. These researchers often work with Cooperative Extension specialists and farm advisers. At UC Davis, many AES researchers are professors within the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and the School of Veterinary Medicine. Generally AES provides funding for these professors to carry out research over the summer so that they dont have to teach summer school.
