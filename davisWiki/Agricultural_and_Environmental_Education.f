Agricultural and Environmental Education (AEE) is a major offered by the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences as of 2010. This major prepares students to enter a teacher credential program in either science or agricultural and environmental education. Students in AEE take classes on a variety of subjects including animal science, plant sciences plant science, soil science, environmental horticulture, economics, and environmental science and policy environmental science. Students are able to specialize in an area of their interest.

It is very flexible with its graduation requirements. You are not limited to the courses offered on the list given in the catalogue. I would strongly advise checking in with your advisor or the Animal Science Office to make sure your courses are compatible.

If you plan on going into the credentials program for agriculture, you will need 2000 hours of agricultural experience,after high school graduation. However, you do not need these hours to graduate with your Bachelors.
