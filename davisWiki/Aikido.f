Aikido was founded in Japan in the early 1920s by wiki:WikiPedia:Morihei Ueshiba (O sensei). The Founder was a famous martial artist well versed in handtohand combat and weaponry who sought spiritual enlightenment through practices that tuned him into the Universal Energy. He achieved his quest and created Aikido as a way to reconcile the world. O Sensei had many disciples throughout the time of his training, and each disciple learned Aikido at a different stage of its development. Some disciples have formed their own traditions within the art of Aikido, based upon where Aikido had developed during the time that they were training with O Sensei. Some prominent disciples of O sensei include:
