Aikido Institute Davis says their mission is to promote peaceful and harmonious human relations by disseminating Aikido and similar arts such as Tai Chi and Yoga that foster personal growth and help individuals tune in to the universal spirit.

Aikido Institute Davis is a member of the Takemusu Aikido Association, which is recognized by the Aikido World Headquarters in Japan. Our training curriculum leads to dan (black belt) ranks issued by Headquarters. The Association consist of about 25 schools that promote the teachings of the Founder as passed on to us by his closest disciple, Saito Morihiro Sensei, 9th dan. The association is part of a vast international network of hundreds of dojos that promote Saito Senseis teaching. Our School is also closely associated with the established Aikido Institute Oakland. For more information, see http://www.takemusu.org/ and http://www.aikidoinstitute.org/.

Kids classes are Monday and Wednesday nights for ages 814 years. The noncompetitive atmosphere focuses on awareness, respect, fitness, and fun. You can come by and watch or try a class for free.

We are dedicated to carrying on the teachings of Saito Sensei but also welcome sincere Aikido students of all styles.
