20071109 17:14:42 nbsp Thanks for the welcome and kind words!  I think Ill just leave that stuff in the entry, sos to not make the main article unreadable.  I dont know how to make a link from the main article to my portion of the page (for instance, on the word advice, or if its even possible, but if you could enlighten me, Ill do that.
Thanks, Users/AirporterDriverPete

20080930 00:09:54 nbsp What up Pete! Users/StevenDaubert

20090521 15:46:45 nbsp Ignoring my comment about the airporter for a moment, I am going to ask the person in question for clarification and update my post accordingly when next I see him.  Ive just got to know, what is your position at the airporter? If youre a driver, do they really pay so well they could keep you for 12 years? Users/MasonMurray

20090521 15:52:46 nbsp Oh, and if in the meanwhile you would like to take down mine and your post on the subject, I would not object.  Also, for font changes you have to use 2 single quotes for italics, if you use a double quote it will not work. Users/MasonMurray

20090521 23:11:19 nbsp Hey there Mason.  Im a driver, and I make 8.50 an hour, plus tips.  Tips average out to about $30 a day,
so that means about 12.50 an hour when all is said and done.  Enough to keep me for 12 years?  Interesting
question.  Without the tip money, perhaps not.  I do work in the office occasionally, maybe twice a year.

To put the driver wage in perspective though, when I started here in 1997, the starting hourly wage was $4.75.

And I have to figure in the fact that I actually love my job!

Regarding fonts and italics, I know youre trying to tell me something about how my posts appear here,
and I think I know what youre talking about, but Im not sure.  My  posts come out doublespaced,
for some reason.  But Im not trying to italicize or anything.  Tell me how to right this, please!

   I think Ive mentioned this to you (if not, I apologize), but you keep hitting Enter at the end of each line of text, as if it were a typewriter.  Just keep typing and the words with automatically wrap themselves.  You probably get something similar in emails you send as well.  In general, only hit Enter at the end of a paragraph (and on the wiki, you likely want to hit it twice to put some space between the two paragraphs).  If thats not clear, just let me know.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
   Also, one of your posts caused every post after it to be italicized, and the date to be in regular font because of a typo where you used {{{}}} rather than {{{}}}. Im not sure you can see the difference, but the 2nd one is 2 single quotes, as the first one is a double quote.  Fonts are edited by placing single quotes before and after the text to be edited, as noted in the Editing quickhelp underneath the edit box.  Users/MasonMurray

20090523 08:28:44 nbsp Thanks Evan (or thanks again as the case may be), and Mason.  Ill try to keep it in mind.  Goes against my typing instincts!  Pete Users/AirporterDriverPete

20090825 19:17:56 nbsp The Questions page might have pointed you to an alternative place to ask you question about the house. Users/JasonAller

20100103 02:06:05 nbsp Pete you da man btw â™¥ Users/StevenDaubert

20100315 17:50:34 nbsp looking good, might need to thumbnail it though! Users/StevenDaubert

20100315 18:23:21 nbsp Thanks Steve, I noticed!   Users/AirporterDriverPete

20100516 02:58:13 nbsp Your music reminds me of Stan Rogers, have you heard of him? I really like it, I plan to buy your album the next time Im downtown. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100516 17:16:34 nbsp Had never heard of Stan Rogers until now, but theres some of his stuff on youtube.  He reminds me a bit of Gordon Lightfoot, both musically and lyrically, who Ive been accused of sounding like, so I guess I see what youre saying!  AirporterDriverPete Users/AirporterDriverPete

20100516 18:07:26 nbsp I especially like your song about the Sunol Grade, I drive it about once a month in my 1984 Toyota Pickup. The geography of it has always interested me, and those silly two Mission Blvd exits :) I also like the part of 80 around American Canyon Road for a place where you can really let it out (at least in my pickup, not too fast!). Thanks! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100516 22:31:19 nbsp Im only on the Sunol Grade about once a year.  The traffic reports are what inspired the song.  Always something bad.  I agree about American Canyon, my favorite part of the daily ride to SFO. Careful of the CHP on the eastbound onramp, I guess you know that.  And thanks for the kind words about the music!  Users/AirporterDriverPete

20100716 13:25:11 nbsp I bought your album yesterday, its great! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100722 17:06:35 nbsp Alright!  Much appreciated, thanks Nick! Users/AirporterDriverPete

20110624 18:04:33 nbsp Im taking the time to Thank Davis Air porter. I flew into SFO yesterday from a messed up Delta flight only to find out that we had reserved the shuttle service a day late. Oops! I guess consumers screw up too! this is last thing you want to hear after flying across the country. Sorry Sir but you booked our service for tomorrow. Well thanks to Davis Air porter they rescheduled my ride and picked me up. That was only part of my positive experience. My driver was one in a million. It was clear he cares. It was the small things like remembering my name and everyone Elses in the Van. Asking if we were comfortable and following up with us during the ride. The traffic was horrible but our experienced driver new the short cuts. Yes, he was concerned about the time we had to spend in traffic making sure I was comfortable as he apologized for the traffic, very sincere. I cant say enough it has been a long time since I had met and spent time with such a guilty person wanting to please his customer. I would use the drivers name but I guess I was to jet lagged to remember. Thank you again for being there when I needed you. The service and the ride was very enjoyable after a hard day of travel. Too my driver, I hope you enjoy your new bike! Users/ChrisLaManna

20110624 22:03:49 nbsp To ChrisLaManna, thanks so much for your nice words.  You actually sent them to my wiki page, so Im bouncing it over to the Davis Airporter wiki page.  Thanks,
Users/AirporterDriverPete

20110624 22:26:03 nbsp I saw this guy gassing up the Davis Airporter van at like 11:45 at night, I asked if he was Pete he said no Pete is a hippie

20110625 20:01:37 nbsp Thanks Steve.  Yeah, I guess its true.  I dont even bathe! Users/AirporterDriverPete
