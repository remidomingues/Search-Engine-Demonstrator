 Philosophy 
Quoted from his website...

At Aisu Pop, we believe in making flavors you can be proud of eating. In a world of massproduced and uninspired fruit pops, we aim to produce flavors that will both delight and challenge your palate.

 Sample list of flavors 
Its all about the flavor with these popsicles. Some flavors, like Strawberry Coconut, are available at every market. Other flavors are only available during the early spring or late fall. Still others havent been seen for two years, and you may have to ask very nicely before hell make them again. But do ask. This is a local business, and it responds to the local market (thats you).

Farmers Market Chef
New to the Saturday Davis Farmers Market Farmers Market: Jaymes is serving up brunch as the Farmers Market Chef! All of his ingredients come from either the farmers market vendors or from the Davis Food Coop.

Debuting on Saturday, March 3rd (aka Pig Day), the Market Chef serves up Pancake Tacos with pancakes, eggs, and bacon or sausage, yummy fruit drinks, and a few popsicle flavors to get us ready for the summer season.

Best of all, though, are his new french doughnuts or beignets. They come in two sizes, small and large. Small is great for kids, or to try them for the first time. Im pretty sure youll soon be buying the Large size, though. Bring some friends to the market and share. A oneofa kind product and food experience not available anywhere else in Davis.

This Weeks Menu
The great thing about the Market Chefs menu is that it changes all the time to fit whats in season at the Market. Sometimes it changed even more often to fit the Chefs mood :)

There is a definite Southern flare to many of the Market Chefs menu items. Authentic greens, real gumbo, and red beans and rice have all graced the menu and delighted and surprised anyone who had given up hope of ever having Southernstyle food in the town of Davis.

Heres a sample list of recent menu items:
On one Saturday in the spring, the menu item was the best sandwich ever commercially available in Davis. Salmon, spring greens, marinated beets, and eggsalad on a grilled baguette. However, that was the first and last time that the Best Sandwich Ever was served.

Several times in the summer, red beans & rice with a fried egg and a side of greens showed up on the menu.
On Saturday, July 28th, a fried green tomato BLT was on the brunch menu. WhistleStop cafe style. Yummy.
On Saturday, August 18th, it was an eggsalad sandwich with smoked salmon. (A la Best Sandwich Ever but minus the marinated beets).
