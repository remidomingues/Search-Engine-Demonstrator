20130621 14:52:04 nbsp Hi, and welcome to the wiki!  I noticed youve been changing the available flavors on the Yogurtland page.  Just a suggestion, but you might find it easier to list the flavors that are always available and the flavors that swap in and out, or, if there are no flavors always available, then just try to make a complete list of all flavors and say that which ones are available may change.  It would make things easier for you, and perhaps a bit clearer for the customer. Users/CovertProfessor

20130903 15:21:30 nbsp Please respond to critical comments on business, dont delete them.  The wiki business pages are About businesses, not For them. Users/JudithTruman

20130903 15:29:55 nbsp The comment has been restored. Please dont remove it. Thank you. Users/PeteB

20130905 18:54:36 nbsp Usually what happens is that anyone is free to add their opinion on the talk page and then the majority opinion is carried out.  So far a few people seem to be in favor of deletion.  If there is no more activity on the talk page in a few hours or tomorrow Ill suggest a deletion and then users can weigh in and hopefully it will be resolved. Users/LoriOrf

20130905 20:19:14 nbsp What LoriOrf said is right... if you ever disagree with another editor about how to edit a page, or just have a question about how to edit a page, the thing to do is to create a Talk page and to discuss the issue with other editors.  I guess you saw that the Yogurtland/Talk page was already created, and everyone seems to agree (me included) that the comment should be deleted.  And now I see that someone has gone and done that.  So, issue resolved!  But again, if you have concerns about an edit in the future, just use the Talk page.  Thanks for working within wiki guidelines! Users/CovertProfessor

20130906 15:56:48 nbsp Sure, glad to help out.  Once one understands that the wiki is a collaborative editing project with the goal of documenting Davis, everything else should make more sense. Users/CovertProfessor
