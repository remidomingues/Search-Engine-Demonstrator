20130118 12:52:09 nbsp I LOVE Akasha!  I started out going here for physical reasons (crosstraining, forced stretching...) but now go for many other reasons (mindbody, overall holistic health).  I was going to one class routinely each week because I loved the teacher, then went another day and loved that teacher, and another, etc... and now find myself going a few times/week.  All of the teachers are awesome.  They are supportive, encouraging, fun, humorous, knowledgeable, helpful, and real.  Im so glad I decided to try this place out, as I definitely plan to keep going back.   Users/Ferd

20131014 21:59:22 nbsp The classes offered here are not even remotely all levels. It is nonstop Vinyasa (flowing through poses rapidly, holding the asanas for one breath only) and the instructors seem to have no concept of how challenging crow pose, for example, is for a beginner yogi. I have some experience with yoga, not a lot, so I was able to mostly keep up, but being a beginner would be ridiculous. They dont explain or demonstrate poses, they just go a mile a minute and youre expected to know what to do.  At both classes Ive been to they BLAST music, and its not meditation/yoga friendly music, its crazy upbeat, distracting, and overwhelmingly loud. The girls doing classes here really seem to see yoga as a workout, and thats it (my friend who took a class here last year in Dec actually had an instructor that yelled out LIFT THAT LEG HIGHER, CMON! WORK OFF THAT THANKSGIVING DINNER! Yoga is about mindfulness, and reconnecting with your inner self through breathfueled asanas, you shouldnt be shocked into pushing yourself to burn more calories, boot camp style. So tacky. Akasha, in my opinion, is one of those studios practicing the worst kind of culturallyappropriated American yoga that has no semblance to its origins as a spiritual, holistic practice. Its all 20 something girls in pricey yogawear looking to get ripped, which is fine for them, but this place obviously isnt for everyone.  Users/Peta
