 Davis AlAnon Family Groups Meeting Schedule 

AlAnon, Alateen and AlAnon Adult Child of Alcoholics Meetings

These AlAnon meetings are part of the Davis AlAnon Family Groups; as such, we follow the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AlAnon.  In adherence to the AlAnon Traditions our groups are Anonymous and the only requirement for membership is that there be a problem of alcoholism in a relative or friend.  You may request a meeting schedule to be mailed to you by calling (530) 7586907 or by emailing alanonfamilygroups@gmail.com .

There are programs available for those dealing with addictions to alcohol or drugs which are separate from AlAnon.

Meeting Schedule



Davis Community Church is a large complex and, while we do put out signs, sometimes it can take a few minutes to locate the rooms.  A map of Davis Community Church can be found here: File(Davis Community Church Map.pdf). While the church address is on C Street, the church requests that we access the meeting rooms from D street, between 4th and 5th.
