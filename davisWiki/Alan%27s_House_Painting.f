20090501 16:40:51 nbsp Brian Neslon at Alans is the best!  I called Alan’s House Painting with an immediate request to paint a backyard trellis and a few doors. The service we received was outstanding. Brian was always on time for appointments, totally professional and most importantly competent and knowledgeable! He got the job done beautifully in record time and the cost was completely reasonable. I HIGHLY recommend Alans House Painting and will defiantly hire them again. FIVE STARS. Users/aemitch
