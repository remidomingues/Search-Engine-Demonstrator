First off, your movies suck, Mr. SmitheeFootnote(For those who dont know, this editors account name is a cinematic pseudonym).  Regal is banal, true, but they have turned around quite a few local theaters that were otherwise simply going to close.  I do wish you the best of luck with your boycott, in that Id vastly prefer more options.  One of the dream goals that my wife and I share is owning a small independent theater in a college town, if only to bring in the likes of Sergeant York and Roman Holiday interspersed with dumb little works like the Torchy Blane series to screen.  Put Danny Kaye back up where he belongs.  And of course The Wizard of Oz and The Rocky Horror Picture Show with full audience participation.    I doubt it would ever make money, but it would be a hell of a fun way to retire.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
