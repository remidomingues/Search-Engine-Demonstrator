Alateen is is a fellowship of young AlAnonFootnote(While Alanon is often written without the hypen, AlAnon is the correct way to write it.) members, usually teenagers, whose lives have been affected by someone elses drinking.

Alateen is not a recovery program for teenagers who are struggling with an addiction to alcohol, although everyone whose life has been affected by alcohol will welcomed warmly.  Twelve step recovery programs are available to deal with addictions such as http://www.aa.org/ Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Footnote(AA is a 12step recovery programs available to teens or adults seeking support in recovery from alcoholism.).

This Alateen support group meeting is part of the AlAnon Davis AlAnon Family Groups; as such, we follow the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AlAnon.  In adherence to the AlAnon Traditions our groups are Anonymous.  Alateen is part of AlAnon, which helps families and friends of alcoholics recover from the effects of living with the problem drinking of a relative or friend. Alateen groups are sponsored by AlAnon members.  The only requirement for membership is that there be a problem of alcoholism in a relative or friend.

There is both an AlAnon meeting for adults and an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at the same place and time as this Alateen meeting. You can find the full Davis AlAnon Family Groups Meeting Schedule at AlAnon.  Additional information about AlAnon or Alateen may be found here: http://www.alanon.alateen.org/ Alanon/Alateen .

Come join other teenagers, sharing in their experience, strength and hope.
