20060828 17:45:24 nbsp Al has a great show on KDVS. He always sounds excited to be on the air and it sounds very professional. Being involved in a community that I love like KDVS certainly increases the liklihood of getting my endorsement. Plus, Ive seen Al talk very well at city hall. Im excited about his candidacy.
