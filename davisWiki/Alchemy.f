Alchemy is a class offered sometimes through the experimental college.  It is taught by Users/DavidPoole and Users/~ LucasMacdonald.  This sixweek course acts as an introduction to the near mystical occult practices of alchemy. The class discusses European and modern alchemies, however it focuses on a more cosmopolitan view.
The class was initially offered in Spring of 2007, but due to scheduling errors, and a failure to meet the minimum number of students, the class has been canceled until Fall.


Totally unrelated but, I saw part of a PBS piece on Newton and went into some of the Alchemy researches he conducted while he was also inventing modern physics, mathematics, astronomy, and other things.  Users/rocksanddirt
 Actually, that was stuff I mentioned in the class. There are many remains of Alchemy in modern cultures and sciences. ~Users/davidpoole
