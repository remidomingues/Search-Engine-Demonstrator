Alcohol by The Barenaked Ladies




Alcohol is in beer, wine and liquor, and often just refers to those beverages in general.  It can be found in bars and retail locations. In the very distant past, it was found in saloons until banned by law.  Up until the early 1980s it was impossible to buy alcohol outside of bars in Davis.  For more on this, see Town History. The California Penal Code Section http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID40496118546+12+0+0&WAISactionretrieve 172 has some convoluted language about where various forms of alcohol can be sold in geographic relation to universities.  In 2002 Davis passed an open container ordinance, banning consumption of alcohol from most public areas.

Youll see a group of strungout people just itching to get their morning fix  tired grad students calling it a night, drunk undergrads, local alcoholics, etc.  And youll occasionally run into someone whos just been released from the drunk tank and is exceptionally bitter.  Great drinking buddies. And then offer them a http://gincocktails.net/ginsling gin sling, and watch them look confused for a second.

  Users/JulieEickhof is one of the few to appreciate a nice cold http://www.heineken.com/usa/WOH/SplashPage/SplashPage.aspx?ReturnURL  Heineken.
  Users/AlexLubinski loves anything from the http://www.newbelgium.com/ New Belgium Brewing Company, most often http://www.newbelgium.com/beers_ft.php Fat Tire.
  Users/KenjiYamada swears by Sudwerk Doppel Bock, the beer that doesnt fuck around.
  Users/ZacharyNorwood knows, with objective certainty, in accordance with the dictates of logical positivism and scientific foundationalism, that genuine Belgian, Trappist ales are the best of all beers. If after tasting a quality Trappist alehttp://www.chimay.com/ Chimay, http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/index2.html Westvleteren, or http://www.trappistwestmalle.be/content/IEFunction.aspx?FPage&ID43&Langnl Westmalle, for exampleyou gag and grimace with disgust, then youre announcing to the world that you have an unrefined palate on account of habituating to beers bottomtenth, namely, Bud, Coors, MGD, and Heineken! But not to worry, good citizen. If you were to develop a liking for this type of beer, youd soon run out of money, for its too dang expensive to enjoy regularly unless you enjoy the profligate benefits of bourgeoisification. For now, Ill have to stick with comparatively cheaper approximations, such as http://www.unibroue.com/products/fin.cfm La Fin Du Monde, even though its slowly driving me into debtors prison.
  Users/JudithTruman enjoys http://www.lindemans.be/htmluk/UKlambik.html  Peach Lambic, a nifty wheat beer with peach juice.  It undergoes a secondary fermentation with wild yeasts, and thus has a sour taste that harmonizes with the sweet fruitiness of the peach.  Opening a bottle requires both a bottle opener and a corkscrew.  Lambics can be found at Nugget in peach, cherry, raspberry, and blackcurrant variations.
  Users/CarlosOverstreet would suggest any one of http://www.paulaner.de/ Paulaners hefeweizens if you can find them.
  Users/KyleAmbroff loves Stone IPA. Unfortunately it is hard to find in Davis. Nugget usually has a bomber available.
  Users/CaseyBarc has many favorite beers.  A list of these beers is found http://www.ratebeer.com/ViewUser216414.htm here
  users/JoePomidor is a sucker for Blue Moon.
  Users/WilliamLewis likes Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout.
  Users/ascapoccia enjoys a nice Sapporo or a hefeweizen on a hot day, and a Guinness, black and tan (half Guiness, half Harp), or a Murphys on a cold day. Belguim beers are really nice as well.
  Users/parker loves winter beers!  Try to get down on Lagunitas Brown Shugga or Samuel Adams Winter Lager.
  Users/ScottMeehleib highly recommends http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971 Pliny the Elder from Aggie Liquor or the locally based http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/219/1080 Doppel Bock from Sudwerk.

   Depends where, if youre drunk, and whats your age.  Just having alcohol (a simple beer can) when underage can grab ya a Minor in Possession  $250. Users/EdWins ES 20050802

20051115 23:40:29 nbsp Question: How true is it that lowcost alcohol can make you puke or get sicker than costly liquor and when you drink low cost alcohol in excess it terrible hangovers that arent associated with high price alcohol? Is this 100% true? If so, why exactly? Tannins and such? Besides taste, whats really the difference between the $37 bottle of gin and the $6 bottle? Users/MichaelGiardina
  A more expensive bottle of gin will usually have less impurities such as sugar in it... the main cause of a hangover is dehydration which sugar is sure to cause Users/DqQuez
    How does sugar cause dehydration?  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen 20060125
      It doesnt; otherwise wed have CocaCola hangovers.  Alcohol interferes with AntiDiuretic Hormone, so more of our bodys water goes into the toilet than we can spare (it isnt just the liquid you drink that makes you go to the bathroom a lot).  Then you add in the differences in electrolytes and enzymes and such, plus any water lost from dancing or breathing through your mouth while passed out, and youre really short on water in the morning.  There is some indication that impurities have something to do with hangovers BUT sugar isnt one, and these impurities arent from cheapness but from tasterelated byproducts seen in red vs. white wine or bourbon vs. vodka, so even expensive brandy would have more than cheap vodka.  I suspect that lowcost alcohol would be drunk more quickly and afforded in greater quantity; it also is less likely to be savored or had with food.  The price difference is largely taste, quality of ingredients and process, and marketing.  A lot of the price in famous brand alcohol is advertising and prestige.  In vodka, which is supposed to be tasteless, youre drinking more advertising than alcohol. Users/NotTires
         Surprisingly I know this, yet I dont even drink. Users/TusharRawat
  It certainly has a correlation, but I have a feeling there is no causation.  People buying cheap hootch do so to get drunk hard and fast.  That gives you a hangover.  People buying an expensive bottle of anything  from your $37 gin to a $400 bottle of scotch  are generally buying it to savor rather than get drunk.  They drink it more slowly and in smaller amounts, and that will prevent a hangover.  Doing the same with a $6 bottle of gin would work, but most $6 bottles of anything arent exactly worth savoring. Users/JabberWokky
         Beware of anything in a plastic bottle is my credo.  I have had bad experiences with $9 handles. Ughhh Users/ChrisWaterstraat

20060716 15:30:06 nbsp Does this mean if I drink water between each alchoholic drink I wont have any adverse affects? Users/SharlaDaly
  It depends on how much you drink, how much food youve eaten, and how much water you drink; if you drink a lot of alcohol, even if youve had a lot of water youll probably still have a hangover but it wont be as bad as it would have been if you hadnt had water. If you drink alcohol on an empty stomach and dont drink any water, chances are higher that youll be hungover later. The best way to avoid adverse affects is to not drink too much, but water and food will also help. A good rule of thumb is drink on a full stomach and follow each alcoholic beverage with a glass of water.

20061020 00:56:55 nbsp Theres a CHEAP place at Travis Air Force Base next to the minimall. Most of the prices will be cheaper than stores outside the base, but there are rarely any more expensive because everything is taxfree. Theres also a huge selection to choose from :) Of course, youd need a military ID card to get in..... Users/RitchieLee
