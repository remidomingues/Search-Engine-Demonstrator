20120319 12:45:09 nbsp Thanks for the welcome! Ive really enjoyed my time at King Hall so far. The student body and the faculty have a close and friendly relationship and the general atmosphere is much more inviting than other law schools I applied to. Of course, well have to see how I feel after finals in May :) Users/AlexHirsch
