Born and raised in Hong Kong, I spent most of my teenage years in San Francisco Bay Area and then went to UC Davis for my higher education. After earning a completely useless BA in English, Im now meandering around Hong Kong, happily fleecing off my parents. And oh, I love slash, too (dont ask if you dont know what it is).

I have an http://litalex.livejournal.com LJ, if anyones interested.
