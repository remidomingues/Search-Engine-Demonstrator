In Progress list:
  Solar food dehydrator, if I can find those blueprints I have all the parts  found at least a diagram to follow, just need an absorbing element and the glass now.
   12/22/07 Update, just needs a clear cover now. Something transparent of the glass, plexi, lexan variety about 3x4
   12/08 Done in time for winter...
  Davis wiki Map update using http://openlayers.org OpenLayers  Im looking for volunteers to help, I know how to do it just need people with time to help implement.
   12/22/07 New branch in the wiki:sycamore svn for mapping. Trying to get a test server up to see if my example map page works.
   12/08 Ready to start testing in the real world, want to help make map markers or pretty up the template? check out the wiki:sycamore:Mapping Mapping Upgrade

To do list:(Message me if you want to learn/help)
  Build a backyard Biodigester, I have plans from a professor in New Zealand who builds these with small farmers in south eastern asia.
  Bike Trailer, after I learn to weld.
  Bike Rack made of old Bicycles, also after I learn to weld sometime soon.
  Solar Oven, saw an old oven by a dumpster today, thought the inside shell might be a good start to this project.

Tabled for later
  Sustainable Desk, while not all reused materials this is an experiment in green building materials. So far I plan to pick up some wheat straw board, and Ive got some bicycle inner tubes for bumpers. This is a hard project since Im trying to build a desk with enough space for a 17 CRT, 1921 LCD, 2 Laptops, a scanner and some scribble space, and yes I realize that much electronics is not sustainable but its how I do things like the edit the wiki and make Sustainable Modern Media.
   Got a free desk instead, reuse always comes 1st.

20071026 07:09:08 nbsp re: IRC.  No worries.  I had been watching it for awhile, noticed it had stabilized and was just tightening up the scattered points.  Ill leave it be. Users/JabberWokky

20071114 08:13:58 nbsp Howdy Alex.  If you use the Mailto() macro, you can present obfuscated email addresses to nonlogged in users (much like you had them), and nice working links to logged in users.  See http://daviswiki.org/GLOBAL/tshirt?actiondiff&version214&version113 my edit here for an example. (Im guessing from your interests I dont need to explain any further, but if you have questions, just ask, or you can read about them in the help documentation). Users/JabberWokky

20071114 16:05:57 nbsp I had much the same problem... I almost filed a bug report because I tested it in IE, and it didnt work.  Then I realized I wasnt logged in. Users/JabberWokky

20071222 00:07:01 nbsp Alex, I thought you built the solar dehydrator already! Users/DanielConstable

20080228 01:06:32 nbsp Odd.  I changed some global wiki settings, but it doesnt like that address. Users/JabberWokky

20081105 13:52:14 nbsp whatsup alex. im definitely interested in solar ovens and solar dehydrators. ive already built a small scale solar oven, out of cardboard and aluminum foil and glass, based off solar joes sunstar design. im interested in building a larger scale solar oven as well as solar dehydrator. let me know what progress youve made on yours, and maybe we can work together to build this big solar oven. im going to be working with some other people to build a big solar oven (box cooker probably) on a bike trailer, to have solar potlucks in the spring. hollar back! peace~b Users/BrennanBird

20091110 11:29:56 nbsp I noticed you added November 19 to GLOBAL. Does that mean Nov 19 of every year (like xmas is always Dec 25) or did you just mean 2008? Dont forget to add the year for onetime events. Users/SteveDavison

20110817 03:56:46 nbsp Alex, new topic: Do you have any experience of GIS mapping of historical data sets onto OpenLayers or Google Map, where historical maps of towns and counties have been digitally imaged and spread over modern maps?   Users/ColinGreenstreet
  Yes that usually involves, digitizing, georegistration and reprojection. Or the eyeball method sometimes called rubbersheeting where you pull on the corners and twist until it fits. If its public data look at Cartagen Knitter or Metacarta Georeferencer (Online tools).
