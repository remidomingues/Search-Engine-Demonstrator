Describe Users/AlexShenko here.

Thats exactly how things work here Alex!  Thanks for the help on Our House, but dont be surprised if it gets changed a few more times.  ;)DM

To echo David, hes absolutely right.  This is a classic wiki, meaning built by the community (as opposed Wikipedia, which just uses wiki software for a specific project).  So there arent any absolute rules, per se (other than a few imposed by the IRS for nonprofit status), but rather just traditions that (hopefully) help everybody work together.  So dont worry about anything; although a couple people can bark occasionally, most people here are pretty friendly.  Welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
