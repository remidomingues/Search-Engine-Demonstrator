That guy who always wears a Hats hat, except when he has to wash his hair, get a haircut, or is in Spiritual Organizations church (might get told by some lady that hes not being respectful, but he probably thinks to himself that if he has to take his hat off they should have to put theirs on.  He is also part Swedish, but the only Swedish he knows is the Swedish Chef Song.
