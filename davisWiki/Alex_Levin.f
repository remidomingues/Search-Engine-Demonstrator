Alex is a Music Scene musician and KDVS DJs KDVS DJ. He is currently studying abroad in the Netherlands.

On the Underground is Alex Levins stunning debut album. Hes learned his lessons well from instrumental masters John Fahey and Leo Kottke, and he also lets in a lot of other influences in making this wonderfully diverse album. I love that he pays homage to these influences, such as by naming some of his songs Song for Townes and Requiem for Fahey, but does not imitate them shamelessly, and instead develops his own vision. Milly Gilly shows off his slide work and is filled with many rich nuances. Southern Town, the sole song with vocals, is a class, solidly constructed singersongwriter piece. Catching the Westbound is complex outside of a strictly folk mode. Lucky Strike has perhaps the most beautiful musical theme on the album. Mojo Blues does new, interesting things with as triedandtrue a style as the blues. Free Coffee is a careful, gentle reprieve from some of the harderedged songs. Off the Grid is cited by Alex as his Sonic Youthinspired song, and it is filled with subtleties and has a driving rhythm worthy of the band. Furthermore, five different guitars were used in recording the album, which lends it even greater texture. Finally, hes giving it away for free, a true artist. There is not an album that I am inspired to recommend more than On the Underground.
