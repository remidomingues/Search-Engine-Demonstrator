 Candidate Statement 

My name is Alex Vahdat, and I am the candidate for fiscal responsibility and transparency in government. Over the past year, ASUCD has mired itself in frivolousness with needless committees and organizations such as the committee on committees and the Campus Outreach and Organizing Office. The associationÂ’s problems do not stem from lack of outreach or poor image; rather, they stem from a failure to address the fundamental responsibilities of the association. I am the candidate that represents a back to basics approach to fix these problems. Through informed decisionmaking, responsibility in spending, and sensible goals, I believe that these issues affecting the association are curable.

I am currently a 3rd year double majoring in Political Science and Economics. I have been involved in multiple campus organizations and have been following the Senate closely for over a year. I am a brother of Delta Sigma Pi, the international business fraternity on campus, where I was the marketing chair for two quarters and vice president of scholarship and awards. In addition to the fraternity, I was the former assistant business manager of The California Aggie. My name is Alex Vahdat and I am running independently for ASUCD Senate.
