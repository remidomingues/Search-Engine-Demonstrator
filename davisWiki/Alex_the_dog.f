Alex is a Dogs dog.  Dog dog dog dog.  Oh sure, he leaps on toys in a very catlike way, and is learning to be fascinated with sniffing cat butts, but I swear to you he walks like a dog, barks like a dog, eats like a dog and poops like a dog.

Alex is a Frankendog. If I say hes a mutt, people start playing the what breeds is he? game.  He probably wont stop mutating for another few months.

See Fig. 1, above.  I found Alex on March 22nd, 2005  skinny, exhausted, rescued from being driven off by a cat while in search of his primary source of nourishment  cat poop.  You may not know this, but cat poop protein levels approach those of dry kibble.  Note that he looks like a skinny, exhausted Lab puppy.  I think he weighed about 10 or 15 pounds.  It felt like 10 when I picked him up, but it felt closer to 15 a mile and a half later.  He had no collar, and when I put him down to see if hed walk he just lay there.  He did have the strength to lick my face as I carried him, but mostly was limp on my shoulder.

Its hard to tell in the photo, but his fur was smooth, silky, and closer to chocolate than black.  All his baby teeth were out, but his adult teeth had not completely grown in yet.  Still lots of gum without teeth.  The vet who gave him his first shots estimated his age at about 6 months.  Note the binocular case behind him and the size of his paws for comparison to:

Fig. 2.  This picture was taken this morning.  Alex started having food allergies almost immediately.  At this point the only things he can eat without losing fur on his back 40 is Royal Canin Sensible Choice Lamb and Rice puppy formula and cat poop; the only treats that dont make him stay up all night itching are Charlee Bear Dog Treats and plain rawhide.

When he was neutered, either stress or an allergic reaction caused nearly all his undercoat to fall out.  This left him looking like hed had a fullbody mohawk.  His fur has changed to a thin salt and pepper coat, a coarse black mane across his back and shoulders, a lions tail, a terriers face and floppy ears.  His fur seems to change color and texture every couple months.  The only constant has been the fur on his ears and the white patch on his chest.

7/8/05 I swear the fur growing on his hindquarters is coming in grey. Alex, PLEASE pick a color and stick with it.  Youre going to drive me insane.

As weird looking as he is, people gaze into his eyes and melt. You have been warned.

8/7/05 Alex has gone missing. Hes was last seen near The Worst Intersection In Davis, and is probably around there, somewhere along Olive Drive, or near Borders or Arboretum the arboretum. If you find him, please contact Users/BlancheNonken or Users/JessicaLuedtke.

20050707 11:11:30 nbsp Alex looks very cuddly!  My dad has a Frankendog of sorts, too.  When he got her a few months ago she was a timid, skinny, scared little white creature with matted hair.  Now shes an outgoing, demanding little oinker/sausage dog who has my dad waiting on her hand and foot and cutting her hair into cute little mohawks, haha! Theyre actually starting to look alike!

20050707 11:25:30 nbsp Thank you!  Today we passed a milestone  he sat quietly and let Darcy give him a nosekiss.  Darcy is part Maine Coon, definitely not frail and delicate, and likes dogs.   Oh, and sure, banana bread it is.  Where can I bring a sample for Bakery approval? Users/BlancheNonken

20050707 11:25:54 nbsp One more thing: Im still looking for Davislocal boarding for Alex; if any of you in dogfriendly apartments are considering my request, please note that Ill pay whatever pet deposit your place requires in order to make this happen.
