20070928 21:05:51 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. You might want to to take a look around the wiki a bit. Users/Graham.Freeman Graham  actually knows quite a bit about this wiki and the purpose of the comment macro. Users/JasonAller

20070928 21:19:26 nbsp i went ahead and removed my post, and his. there is no sense in starting a flame war, which is what it seems like he was aiming for. You can post a reply without being confrontational, and everyone can be courteous.

Since he elected not to do so, i figured it best to avoid the situation entirely and just remove the post & subsequent flame. Users/Alexander1975

20070928 21:32:07 nbsp Hi, Alexander,

Im sorry if you felt that I was trying to flame you  that wasnt my intention.  I do tend to be rather blunt, but I feel thats a virtue.  Not everyone agrees.  :)

Ive spent enough time on Davis Wiki and other Wiki Spot wikis, both in terms of the content and in terms of the behindthescenes tasks, that Ive come to feel strongly that negative and positive comments about a person or entity really do need to have substance and a bonafide identity standing behind them.  Its easy to trashtalk someone or something if youre sure that your own reputation isnt at stake, but when youre posting under your own real name then you have an incentive to think more about what you write.  This is a community, after all, and communities thrive only when neighbors know each other.

FWIW, Id be saying essentially the same thing if a Blockbuster apologist came on and started posting anonymous nonspecific glowing reviews. Users/Graham.Freeman

20070928 21:57:55 nbsp I understand your point of view. My intent wasnt to ingender ill will. In all fairness, there are enough negative comments about blockbuster to where one more from me would be like throwing water on a fish. Users/Alexander1975

20070929 21:38:08 nbsp Garbage.  Dont use your real name.  Feel free to edit and comment on other pages too.   Users/EdWins
