Goodbye, Davis!  Its been nice knowing you for five years!

Hello there!  Ive been in Davis for quite a while.  Still bike to work, still plinkin away on Davis Wiki, still takin on the challenges of life as I figure out where I go next.

I take pictures.  I dump a truckload of new pictures every so often for the wiki.  I love the exercise, but I really need to make a mental note to stop eating out every time I go downtown.  It gets expensive.

You can spot me working at the Rite Aid on Russell Blvd.  feel free to say Hi from DavisWiki! Ill be totally pleased.  Youll also spot me cooking stuff in the apartment.



  Hi, I think I was kind of a jerk to you at Rite Aid once, so I apologize. If you have no idea what I am talking about, never mind.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100414 23:54:09 nbsp I havent seen the red, white, and blue ones in a bit. They might have been loaners until they got the ones labeled as Unitrans buses? http://daviswiki.org/Unitrans_Buses Users/hankim
