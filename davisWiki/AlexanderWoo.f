I am a postdoc (officially a Visiting Research Assistant Professor) in the Department of Mathematics.  I seem to be slowly becoming a Davis Friends Meeting Quaker (though not in any official sense).  I am still a half decent classical piano player.  Given my attitude towards photographs, you are not likely to see one of me anytime soon.

I will be permanently leaving Davis within a few days.

 Quote of the Indefinite Time Period 

I dont think it would have all got me quite so down if just once in a whilejust once in a whilethere was at least some polite little perfunctory implication that knowledge should lead to wisdom, and that if it doesnt, its just a disgusting waste of time!
