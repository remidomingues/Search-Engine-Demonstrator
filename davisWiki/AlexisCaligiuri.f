20130422 10:41:15 nbsp Alexis what is your favorite star trek series and what are some of the animes you peep? Users/StevenDaubert
   My favorite series is TOS, then TNG and then VOY. I actually have a science officers uniform from the original series! My anime tastes are very immature I especially love traditional Magical Girl and Hetalia, though I strive to be among the gentler, calmer, less psychopathic members of the fanbase of the latter. AC
     If you havent given it a shot, check out the fourth season of Enterprise.  The change when Manny Coto took the series over is startling,  and as a fan of TOS, was absolutely perfect (other than the horrible finale).  I say this because I know Trek fans who couldnt get into Enterprise and missed out on the fourth season refocus.  Coto wraps the prior plotlines in a couple episodes and then launches headlong into classic Trek themes and concepts.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
      Yeah, that was me.  I think I only made it through two seasons of Enterprise, and that was after surviving all of Voyager, which had its moments but was not my favorite.  (My ordering is TNG, DS9, TOS.  Someone could probably do a psychological analysis of different peoples Trek orderings).   Users/CovertProfessor
       I agree about the psychology of Trek preference!  I only made it through the first two seasons of Enterprise I couldnt stand the Temporal Cold War storyline or the crews initial incompetence. But I will be sure to check out the fourth season! My only other gripe about that show was the fact that they put a coherent song as the theme song. They were singing the words. Why would they do that?! AC

20130927 16:15:56 nbsp It was nice meeting you! I would love the chance to get to know you better and continue nerding out re: metaphysics of star trek... Users/StevenDaubert
  Definitely! Would you be up for coffee and trek talk sometime? Or should I just keep buying crepes? Or both? AC
  yeah sounds good. Do you have a caffeine preference or would Cloud forest Cafe Cloud Forest do? I was brought back to the crepe for a few more weeks b/c the 3 Degrees of Davis normal guy got injured. Owner usually departs by 14:00 if you come by after then I can hook it up! Daubert
 Cloud Forest sounds great! What day/time works for you? And I will definitely have to hit up the crepe! :) AC
    Sometime that is conducive to actually kicking it instead of rushing... Next weekend in the early afternoon? Daubert
     Next Saturday around 2pm sound good? AC
      fantastic  rendezvous around 2 ~SD

AC: I totally forgot to ask what your middle name was, also when get your bike & finish midterms here is a list of stuff to go check out... The Dominoes which are part of Northstar Greenbelt, Oxford Circle Park Big Kids Park & the Arroyo Park UFO East D has Slide Hill Park Slide Hill. In South D check out Willowcreek Greenbelt & the home/castle occupied by the partial inventor of the artificial heart (he did a valve and a right ventricle?) South of El Macero . There are other noteworthy spots but this is a good start to exploring Davis ~Daubert
  Thanks! AC
