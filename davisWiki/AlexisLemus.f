Currently a beginning editor for wiki and wiki alike. I work for Asian Auto Care as a Marketing Agent and for Cutco Knives. If you know me, feel free to stop by and edit or leave a comment of my page.

20081113 16:38:35 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Alexis, and Welcome to the Wiki welcome to Davis Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the information to Asian Auto Care, but traditionally removing peoples reviews is frowned upon.  Ive restored the reviews you removed, and you might want to take a look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide for business owners by clicking here.  Its an informal list of tips and hints that the community has put together that might give you some ideas of how to respond in a more positive manner to negative reviews.

20081113 13:49:17 nbsp Also, placing tons of links on the Explore page is a bit unfair to the rest of the businesses in Davis.  In some circles it would be called Spam... you might want to discuss edits to the Front Page until you get a hang of how the wiki works.  If you have any questions, theres an entire community of editors here to help you out. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081113 14:08:15 nbsp Hey, all you had to say was that there are new owners.  The old comments get archived, not deleted in that case.  It appears that the name is still Care, not Club... did the name of the business change?   It seems, however that the last reviews are from after the ownership change, if it happened in Spring.  If you would like, I can move those reviews over for you.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081113 14:22:54 nbsp um how can i contact you? Users/AlexisLemus

20081113 14:23:38 nbsp well the problem is that we believe that the business has negative comments because of the previous owners Users/AlexisLemus

20081113 17:29:14 nbsp Well, you can always call me (I missed you in chat, sorry about that)... but Im just one editor (just like youre an editor now), and its not up to just me.  There are People loads of other editors involved, and I cant speak for all of them.  I just happened to be the one who noticed that you were removing reviews.  Actually, to be precise, another editor noticed and sent me a text message pointing out that you were removing other peoples reviews.  If you want some help or advice, Id be happy to talk to you.  The wiki community tends to keep all past reviews, even for Departed Businesses businesses that closed down years ago... the wiki is a resource for the community of Davis, not a simple business listing site.  As a result, when a business changes hands, the old reviews are archived for historical reasons, not deleted.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081113 15:22:07 nbsp ok, um, so I just made a new page for the site and for the new club our shop is going to open, is that ok, oh and i also put a link about the club in the wiki news. Should i take that link off? Users/AlexisLemus

20081113 22:06:44 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please review the Copyrights page regarding some of the images youve uploaded of cars. Users/JasonAller

20081114 12:06:53 nbsp Apparently some people feel the way you are wording the page reads more like an advertisement than just statements of facts about the business. Perhaps you could have a facts / info up top and then a message to potential customers from you below clearly marked? You could also always make another page for the car club as well!

Welcome to the wiki btw! Users/StevenDaubert

20081114 12:07:37 nbsp Howdy, its not that the page is really bad, in any way, it just doesnt stick with the (generally) NPOV balanced format that the wiki follows. Its not very strict, but most pages on the wiki dont look like they were written by the owners or a marketing firm. I figured I would put in the flags so that other people in the community take that into account when they are editing the page, and then eventually either a happy medium will be reached and the flag will be removed, or they will decide that its unnecessary and remove it themselves. Users/JoePomidor

20081114 12:11:29 nbsp Im not Joe! Im Daubert! Users/StevenDaubert

20081114 12:15:10 nbsp because I am me! Joe is someone else, I was just answering your question that you asked to joe.

Feel free to ask questions about the wiki if you have them! Users/StevenDaubert

20081114 15:01:51 nbsp Hey, Alexis... did you get permission from CarWalls.com to release that photo of the Accord on Asian Auto Club to the Wiki?  Check out the Copyrights entry for details, but all the photos on the wiki are free for anybody to use, so the original copyright holder has to agree to that.  Thats why there was a photo request on one of the entries: so somebody could go down and take a photo themselves so the photo was free to use. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081117 11:13:00 nbsp I reverted the Asian Auto Care and Asian Auto Club deletes you made; your comments said that the owner wants to recreate them without the page sounding like an ad. Its great that the owner wants to get involved with DavisWiki. A couple things about your comment: one, since the entries can be edited and changed without having to delete them, its better to keep them up and available so that if someone needs to reference them, the information is available. Two, because those entries can be edited by anyone, the owner should be aware that the entry might not end up exactly how s/he wants  its likely other DavisWikians will get involved and make edits of their own.
