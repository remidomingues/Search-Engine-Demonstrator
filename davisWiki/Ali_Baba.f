Ali Baba Cafe is a wonderful little Persian restaurant two blocks from campus on 3rd Street and A Street.  During lunch times the place gets packed. Ali Baba serves pita wraps, burritos, sandwiches, salads, Hamburgers burgers (cheeseburgers especially), and has daily lunch specials. The burgers are on the greasier side of the spectrum, a plus for some.

 Daily Specials 


Monday: Istanbuli Polo (Curry Rice, Chicken, & Green Beans)
Tuesday: Gheymeh Polo (Basmati Rice with Chicken & Lentils)
Wednesday: Bagheli Polo (Dill & Lima Bean Rice with Curry Chicken & Onion)
Thursday: Gourmet Sabzy (Basmati Rice with Chicken & Spinach)
Friday, Saturday, & Sunday: Fesenjan (Basmati Rice with Pomegranate, Walnut, and Chicken)

The daily specials are $5.49 plus tax, are ready in an instant, and taste very good. Make sure you mix in the yogurt they give you  its delicious! Also, you can order a halforder of the specials that runs much cheaper and gives you nearly as much food  they give you as much sauce but less rice. They have a red hot sauce that you can put on the rice to kick it up a notch.

Their menu lists http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyros gyros, sandwiches, burritos, cheeseburgers, Indian dishes (i.e. chicken and green peas in curry rice), onion rings, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyros baba ganouj, salads, and more. They are a Jack of all trades (where else can you get a Veggie Burrito, Falafel, and a Cheeseburger?). No sushi though.

The regulars (owners?) are always relaxing inside, playing backgammon against each other.  Ali Baba is perhaps the backgammon capital of the area.

Also offering Mediterranean food (gyros, falafel, kebabs, dolmas,...) is Sams Mediterranean, which is just a block down the street. Both are very popular, but Ali Baba may get slightly more business due to its proximity to campus and the fact that they take credit cards and Sams doesnt. However, because of this, your food generally comes out faster at Sams. Because both restaurants are so close in quality and location, there seems to be a bit of a rivalry; some people swear by Sams Mediterranean, others swear by Ali Baba, but most are just excited that we have two great Mediterranean joints so close to campus.

Ali Baba offers free WiFi Hot Spots wireless internet.

Ali Baba changed ownership in June, 2008. It was renovated in late November/early December 2008.  The walls have been painted bright colors, the floor has been redone, there are new (and much nicer) tables and chairs, and there are new menu signs over the counter.  The exterior was redone, too.  Those that like the holeinthewall look will miss the old decor, but its hard not to see this as a drastic improvement in ambiance.  It was renovated again in 2011, around the same time they obtained a liquor license.

Another thing to note is that they charge 35 cents to run a credit card as of 8/2011.

20080127 20:16:01 nbsp The burgers are good. Users/GregWebb

20080206 11:58:39 nbsp I ordered their special today, which was the Baghali Polo...dill and lima beans mixed with rice and a side of chicken curry.  I used to hate the way dill smelled and tasted, but this one was more of a lightly fragrant smell rather than the really heavy smell that I was used to.  The rice was light yet very flavorful, and the chicken was tender and well flavored by the curry.  You should definitely mix the yogurt sauce into the rice; it really adds to the flavor. Users/wootywoo

20080219 22:56:54 nbsp Good falafel sandwich (much better than Sams which has soggy falafel).  I agree with the other comments that the service is slow, but the food is hot and cooked to order so I dont mind! Users/mj

20080318 15:58:04 nbsp Two notes. Firstly, they never seem to change their specials.. ever, which is amusing. Secondly, they used to have good onion rings.. but now they dont, early march I went there expecting some nice deep fried battered crispy onion greasy deliciousness, but sadly was served some reconstituted premade stuff that they had heated in their fryer. I felt a bit gyped.  Users/DavidPoole

20080319 00:18:20 nbsp I believe the specials correspond to a certain day of the week.  For example, you will find the same special every Thursday.  Perhaps you tend to visit on the same day each week. Users/IDoNotExist

    I believe it has been the same 5 dishes for at least the past 17 years.  Users/JimEvans

20080406 09:43:10 nbsp The food here is good and inexpensive.  Definitely a good place to eat. Users/IDoNotExist

20080414 18:45:01 nbsp the specials are really good! especially the tuesday special, as well as the friday (pomegranite special). you can even order 1/2 special which is still a lot of food. i also highly recommend the burgers. if you do not want a lot of toppings you can always request that they be taken off, there are a lot of good combinations.
PS. davidpoole, the onion rings are cooked the same way they have always been  Users/ReginaGunn

20080418 19:08:35 nbsp I got the Veggie Special today at 11:00. The cook down was 25 minutes but I had nothing to do so I was not in a rush. You can grab a copy of the Aggie while you wait for your food. The Veggie Special is a cup of sweet curry with potatoes, carrots, and lima beans with a huge rice and a small cup of non sweet yogurt. The food is very good considering the price is just a little under $6. If you are healthy, you can divide the Veggie Special into two portions (share with a friend or take out) and still be full. Good place if you dont mind the long wait.  Users/justinhu

20080422 12:55:39 nbsp for about $8 I got a REALLY dry and sort of gross salmon burger, fries and a drink. Compared to other salmon burgers that I have paid the same amount or less for, I was REALLY disappointed to say the least...disgusted might better convey my feelings. However, I LOVE Ali Babas falafel and regular burgers, so I cant say that the entire restaurant is bad, in fact its pretty good. The service is faster around lunch time and their fries are great (I dont like a lot of salt so I think their choice, but adding salt might be a good idea for some people).

My advice for first time, or anytime, Ali Babagoers, get ANYTHING on the menu BUT the salmon burger...gah.  Users/ArianeMetz

20080511 11:50:19 nbsp Ive been to Ali Baba a couple of times now, and I like the food there.  The gyro I had was pretty good, and the dolmas were the best Ive ever had.  Last time I ordered the gyro burrito and got waaaaaaaay more than I expected.  It was the biggest burrito Ive ever seen.  It was also very tasty, and how could you pass up a bottle of Sierra Nevada for 1.50!!!  Hell, all their bottles are a 1.50.  Good food and cheap beer, what more could you want? Users/JasonA

20080614 03:54:38 nbsp Ali Babas Bacon Cheeseburger  delicious. and they dont put stupid onion rings on it like the fast food places. Users/KellyCorcoran

20080823 01:19:13 nbsp I absolutley love Ali Babas! Ive been going here for the longest time, my parents took me ever since I was a toddler. I can remember it going from different owners, and its various remodels. I just recently went there again after not having been there for a long while. It is absolutley the best place for Persian food (im persian) other than my dad. Highly recommend the Fesenjun, which is Fridays special. Its this pomegranate walnut sauce with chicken. To die for. They give you wayyy more than you can eat, and just the right price.  Users/natalie0927

20081015 21:20:49 nbsp I think they may have changed their hours.  They were not open when I biked by last Sunday (before 9 PM).  Anybody know their new hours? Users/IDoNotExist

20081015 21:33:22 nbsp We really, really miss their burgers.   Users/EdWins

20081107 18:10:26 nbsp Hi everyone,
My name is Ali and Im the new owner of ALI BABA.
Im remodeling the restaurant and its going to look great, Im very excited. Ali Baba will be closed Nov. 27th30th.
Im planning on having an opening party with music and everything $5. Please let me know what you think, as your
feedbacks are greatly appreciated. I hope to make your visit to Ali Baba a lot more pleasant.
Thanks again,
Ali

p.s. feel free to contact me, my email is: alismoghaddam@gmail.com Users/alismoghaddam

  I hope the remodel goes smoothly, Yesterday I had a mushroom cheeseburger which was excellent and today as well as the day before last I had the feta cheesburger with bacon. Both times it was wonderful.  Users/StevenDaubert

  Hey Ali, its good to see that youre having a reopening.  I met you not long after you actually took on ownership, but I doubt you remember me since it was quite a while ago.  Let me know if you have any flyers that youd like to distribute and Ill help get them around downtown. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081108 11:35:24 nbsp Are you the new owner (as of some time this summer), or the new new owner?  ie. Did Ali Baba change hands again after Darish sold it? Users/IDoNotExist
I dont think so, but Ali is the current owner and its always nice to see business owners on the wiki!  Users/StevenDaubert

20081109 17:04:12 nbsp SunjeetBaadkar, I actually do remember you, if I recall correctly you either work or own a bookstore, right? Users/alismoghaddam

  Awesome memory, my friend!  Yes, I work at the independent bookstore downtown. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081110 23:57:04 nbsp I went to Ali Babas last week with a few friends. To my dismay, they were out of their delicious Onion Rings (on a Friday night, A FRIDAY NIGHT!?)!!! I wasnt VERY hungry, so I ordered a Greek salad (which has NOTHING on Crepevilles, and was honestly kind of expensive). In the end, I needed to get some salt, and again, I was bitterly let down. THEY HAD DONE AWAY WITH THEIR STEAK FRIES! OH THE HUMANITY! Now they have (obviously prefrozen) crinklecut fries...oh I was so sad!! I will definitely go back to Ali Babas for their deliciously oniony falafel...but for now they have disappointed me. Aree Rating: 7/10.  Users/ArianeMetz

 As of December 17th, they had the steak fries.  I was there to get an appetizer platter that night (see my other comment below) and during the wait had got some of the fries. Users/SunjeetBaadkar


20081118 11:40:43 nbsp I should have heeded the comments and got a burger.  I ordered the falafel sandwich to go  wrong move.  Old lettuce and no tzaziki sauce.  Falafels were soft, not crunchy.  I was quite disappointed since I had my mouth all set for tzaziki sauce.  Oh well.  The place smelled of old grease too.  Open a door or window!! Users/Zabadu
  Falafel sandwiches rarely have tzaziki, rather they are prepared with a tahini sauce. Tzaziki is a Greek yogurt based sauce, not middle eastern. Users/ScottWeintraub

20081203 18:32:01 nbsp  Service is toooooooo slow! I used to go there for lunch but ever since this year, they seem to have changed things around. I used to be in and out of there in under 10 minutes (take away orders). Now it takes too long and management is pretty much incompetent . Whatever happened to the beer?? Burgers and Brew is the way to go now even for lunch.  Users/Smithhammond

20081203 18:43:30 nbsp Ive found that since the management changed, it takes exactly the same amount of time to get my food as it did before.  The time is primarily dependent on how long it takes the cook to make whatever you ordered.  Its the same cook.  Only the people at the counter have changed. Users/IDoNotExist
  Actually you are mistaken. The cooks are different. It used to be this guy called corneelio now its a different guy. I remember him very well and he used to be fast and always took care my orders (#3 on wheat).

20081204 11:57:51 nbsp Can someone tell me if they serve Kabob Khoobedeh and how good it is? Users/condemned2bfree
  Nevermind. Went for lunch today. It was excellent. Try the Kubideh Kabob if youre a meateater. Its not the best Ive ever had. The rice could use some taste, but the meat was grilled fairly well  very slightly overcooked, but excellent nonetheless because of how juicy it was. The service is good. Some dishes you have to wait for 1015 minutes but thats to be expected for food like that. The guy at the counter is very nice. Gazoye irani ghalee goubeh (Persian food is very good!) Users/condemned2bfree
Hell, yea it is!  Beh Salemati!Users/CurlyGirl26
 It looks like they no longer serve Kubideh Kabob as of this update (May 2011), but the person at the counter said they were bringing it back.  That was dissapointing because that is my favorite persian food item.  I will keep a look out.  users/ChrisDietrich

20081226 11:23:06 nbsp Well Scott, in Los Angeles, where the falafel is good, you get a version of a tzaziki  a yogurt based sauce.  However, even if they did have it, I wouldnt go back  the place smelled badly of old grease. Users/Zabadu
   Im sure that many places around the country often serve tzatziki with eastern Middle East cuisine.  It just doesnt happen to be actually part of that regions traditional cuisine.  Its tasty, but expecting it is silly.  Slide on down to Café Méditerranée where the menu is based on a region a bit farther west and you can both get falafel and tzatziki. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081226 11:54:34 nbsp I came here for an emergency (for lack of a better term) run for food for a small gathering.  I needed a platter of different finger foods in a short amount of time.  After patiently spending some minutes discussing the options with me, the onsite owner worked out a great platter of various vegetarian and nonvegetarian options at a decent price.  About 15 minutes later, the entire thing was ready to go.  The platter (which consisted of various kebabs, dolmas, falafel, etc) was a hit and was completely consumed over the course of the night. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090106 23:23:15 nbsp I like the remodel!  Also, it seems that the restaurant has been reestablished in nonEuclidian space.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20090114 00:36:15 nbsp Theyve renovated the place and it looks a lot better than before. They have a filafel wrap that is ivery/i similar to the kind they serve at Sams right across the street. They prepare their filafel pieces a little differently though, and I actually prefer Ali Babas version. Not bad for $5. Plus they have a buy 10 get one free card. I dont know if they still give those out, though.  Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090211 20:43:23 nbsp Both the quality of the food and the atmosphere of Ali Baba have improved substantially since Ali took it over and rennovated it.  Recommended. Users/IDoNotExist

20090219 20:44:38 nbsp Their burgers are definitely worth their price, their fries are amazing, and their Wednesday Special rice is wonderful. I never take rice back home from a restaurant, but this was my first exception. Users/JonathanChee

20090529 03:11:59 nbsp its impossible to get something wrong, all the food here seems so wonderful. i love the daily special with lima beans and dill weed in the rice. that is just soooooooooo freakin delicious. i normally hate dill too. the lamb kebabs are soooooooo succulent, pour some lemon to take off grease and bring out the flavors. Oh and i love how they give you yogurt when you ask for it. hmmmmmmm. i havent tried their burgers, but im curious now! the prices are very reasonable. it may not seem so because the restaurant leans more toward being quaint than elegant. but the food speaks for itself. Users/chand3123k

20090614 12:49:45 nbsp mmmmm food here is so good and the service is always friendly, especially the guy there.  Users/skinnyfatgirl

20090621 01:02:12 nbsp I like the new environment. I usually get the feta burger, but ive also had a chicken salad here. Both very good and reasonably priced. I would be interested if they added additional persian dishes to the menu.  Users/Babhari

20090716 21:38:25 nbsp The kebabs are pretty good and it was very cool to find out that one of the cashiers out front is from my neighbprhood back home. Users/BryceH

20090723 14:57:23 nbsp Went there recently after a loonng hiatus after reading of the recent renovation. The cook still very creepily ogles the female patrons, and the chicken chunks in the lunch specials still has pink in the middle. Probably wont go back again. Users/AnnieSirrah

20090726 19:41:18 nbsp Recently decided to check this place out after many years living in Davis, and extremely happy and wish found it earlier!  We dont go out to each much, but recently weve been going here about once a week.  The daily specials are super good and their burgers are amazing!  the bacon is incredible!  The fries are awesome and seasoned with cinnamon and something else (anyone know what it is?), and thick cut.  You only need to get the small fries for two people if you get other food, as the portions are really big.  super chill staff, free drinks after 5pm, and good music on the ipod.  great stuff and pretty cheap for students! Users/ADP

20090823 14:37:19 nbsp Im a huge fan of the Aggie Kebab over the Greek Salad.  A bit pricey for an everyday meal, but absolutely satisfying and filling. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091111 11:04:15 nbsp The Feta Burgers are the best in town (even after Burgers and Brew opened) and the Spinach Special on Thursdays is amazing. The owner is often on site and has an excellent attitude. Users/GJC02

20091205 15:40:10 nbsp Nice People working here. It is very cramped though.  I like their Wednesday special a lot. They need to do something about their bathroom though, the door doesnt even lock! Users/JSlice

20100213 20:25:20 nbsp I do not recommend this place.  I ordered the Thursday special, and it arrived before we had the chance to sit down at our table.  I didnt realize that I was ordering fast food, but it wasnt much more than that.  Both the chicken AND spinach were definitely out of a can (you know the flavor), which from the first bite was a huge disappointment.  Overall, the waitress was nice, but the food was far from good.  We tried this place b/c of the good reviews on here, but we wont eat here again. Users/ibirdie

20100318 18:12:59 nbsp I am not a fan of the Styrofoam plates, cups, bowls etc but the food is good. My boyfriend loves the burritos because they are bigger than Chipotle, cheaper, and have more flavor. The salads are pretty good, and the specials are good prices. My personal favorite is the grilled cheese because it comes with tomato soup and a salad only for $5. The food quality varies from time to time but I have never had a bad experience. If youre looking for somewhere quick and consistent in quality, ali baba is the place  Users/cj2012aggie

20100412 18:30:38 nbsp The Aggie Kebab is seriously the best meal in Davis. Why? Sit down and listen. Yeah it sounds basic (just grilled chicken and rice right lol??) Well shut the hell up because it is unbelievably satisfying and delicious. Get it like I do, all rice with grilled onions and feta cheese. Eating it is the closest thing to a religious experience I have ever had in my whole life. All for around $8? Get the hell out of here, this is the best value in food in Davis and probably in North America. The owner Ali is tight as hell too, he knows what is up. I just ate the meal again and said out loud to myself God damn after every few bites, its that good. You better eat there Users/LoooongBusRide

20100528 20:22:13 nbsp Its all true about the burgers.  So good!  The charness of the meat contrasts wonderfully with the cool ingredients, and to my mind that is what makes a great burger.  I cant believe Ive lived here 10 years and hadnt tried them before, although I had tried other items (like the Fesenjoon ;)  This is now my favorite burger in Davis  edging out Cafe Bernardos.  I also really liked the fries with cinnamon on them. Users/ZannGates

20100606 14:48:42 nbsp I just had a Falafel Wrap here at Ali Babas and it was delicious.  I recommend getting one of the side sauces to dip the wrap.  A+ Users/Darkfallin

20100731 00:21:53 nbsp I love their feta burgers (although they could probably use more feta), and I used to get their gyro burritos all the time (do they still have those?). The fesanjon is also really good. Judith once ordered a HUGE cup (a gallon, maybe?) of freshsqueezed orange juice which was delicious and took about half an hour to prepare. She says it also totally skewed her data for the Nutrition 10 trackyourfoodintakeforaweek project. Sadly, they do not offer freshsqueezed orange juice anymore; presumably we drank all of it. Users/BarnabasTruman

20100926 17:16:07 nbsp Really good food at relatively cheap prices. Also not a fan of the styrofoam, but hopefully if enough people mention it theyll change? The vegetarian special (on the board on the left wall) is always a good choice.  Users/Kipusa

20101005 19:23:06 nbsp I love Ali Babas, especially for their chicken burrito!  Its awesome that it comes with cinnamon chicken, wheat tortilla (without having to request it), and great veggies, cheese, and rice.  I also love their bacon cheeseburger when Im in that beefy mood.  Probably the Davis eatery Ill miss the most after graduation.  Users/MichaelS

20101010 15:42:15 nbsp The aggie kebabs here are insanely delicious. You have to get it with grilled onions on top too. The chicken is unbelievably tender and flavorful, havent tried anything else here yet because I can never bring myself to order anything else but this is easily one of the best restaurants in davis. Users/JennyAdler

20101018 21:43:39 nbsp Ummm, starting today this place is starting to charge a 20 cents surcharge for credit card use... shady.... Users/Wiiman

20110104 21:57:55 nbsp TERRIBLE. My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant on 1/3/11 and ordered the Monday special, Falafel Sandwich, Hot Soup, Hummus, and Baba Ganouj. The Falafels were burnt, the Special was just dry chicken on dry mexican rice, the Hot soup was Basically tomato soup with some spice, and the hummus and baba ganouj were not very good either. Worst Place I have eaten. The sushi restaurant across the street was much better. Do not waste your money here. Users/RichCar

20110108 11:24:40 nbsp I recently had lunch here with two old friends. I really do not know why I never went here earlier...it was fantastic! I got the Aggie kebab with half salad, half rice. The chicken was tender and wonderfully marinated. I had been a little worried about the lemon or onion overpowering everything else, but it ended up being perfect. The salad dressing is AMAZING. Period. Im not a big veggie eater, but if you put that dressing on pretty much anything, Id probably eat it. Also, for the price of the plate, there was a good amount of food, and would actually have been too much had I not skipped breakfast that day. I am hoping to go on a weekend, soon, because the weekend special sounds perfectly suited for me with the tart fruit, nut, chicken combo being one of my favorites! Users/Anja

20110113 13:28:48 nbsp Like many others, I frequently get the Aggie Kabob. It is almost always great and delicious. Make sure you get it with grilled onions. However the falafels seem to have gone downhill, the last two times they have been really burnt/hard. Ill still go to Alis for the Aggie Kabob but Sams falafel has my vote. Users/Sar58

20110203 20:38:23 nbsp I love this place. I dont think you can go wrong with any of the specials and they are relatively inexpensive compared to their competitors nearby. I have also had their burritos, grilled cheese, soups and salad and cant complain about any of them. I agree with the above reviews that the aggie kabob is especially good. My favorite special is the walnut/pomegranate chicken I believe its on Fridays and Saturdays. The owner is always really friendly and I dont have a single bad thing to say about this restaurant.  Users/cj2012aggie

20110409 21:08:20 nbsp Nice and tidy little restaurant. Both the man and the lady that work at the counter (at least on Saturday nights) are extremely nice. I strolled into the restaurant cluelessly, and after staring at the menu for a while, he figured I was new. Thus, he proceeded in kindheartedly helping me find a meal perfect for the night. I ordered the suggested food items, payed (using a CampusCred voucher, w00t!), and waited for at most 10 minutes before my food was DELIVERED to me. The only problem I had was that my lamb gyros was soggy :( It was quite good though, and the onion rings were incredibly fresh. Unfortunately, neither of them tasted spectacular to me; just didnt suit my taste buds. The lamb inside the gyros were delicious, but that was about it. The onion rings arent your classic onion rings; they taste a bit different, and not how I like them. Dont let me discourage you from trying it though :) Everything was worth trying.

Oh, for those of you new to this restaurant, you actually have to go to the counter and order, as well as seat yourself. I didnt know this at first, haha. Felt like a fool :3 Oh wells. :P

Overall, good experience, nice restaurant, the gyros and onion rings just arent my choice food items. Will come here again and try their weekend special :D Users/KimberlyKitHom

20110521 13:34:01 nbsp This place is disgusting, and I will never come back. I ordered a falafel wrap, and my boyfriend ordered lamb over rice. My wrap was tasteless and overloaded with the white sauce (tahini?) It basically felt like I was drinking it. The falafel itself was just soso, a bit dry and not even as good as the falafel Ive made at home from an instant mix. The lamb over rice was the worst part. It looked like stringy, dried meat that was slightly burnt and covered in grease, all laid out over dry, old rice. His dish was about about $12$13, if I remember correctly. For that price, it should at least be edible. I was in a rush to get back to school, so on the way out we let them know that we werent very happy with the lamb dish. The man working at the counter sort of shrugged in response. No apology, nothing. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy.  Users/blee

20110527 20:35:10 nbsp are they no longer giving a drink for the daily specials? the last two timse i went, i didnt get a drink.. today i actually asked if the special came with a drink and he said no. anyone? Users/SallyVo

20110727 23:37:55 nbsp Customer service quality has been decreasing every time I go there. Also, they charge you extra than what the actual price says! The receipt doesnt state how much the tax is, but if you total it in your head, they charge you some cents more. I never complained because it was always less than a dollar, but it just shows you how shady these businesses can be.  Users/stephaniesun

20110731 22:32:46 nbsp The Aggie Kabob with grilled onions is fantastic.  Users/JanaShute

20110816 16:28:32 nbsp Even if the food isnt spectacular, the customer service is enough to keep me coming back. Ali Baba also supports many organizations on campus via fundraising events, and the owner is extremely nice. They have AC too, which is nice. :D  Users/PaulV

20110822 18:22:02 nbsp Ali Baba is a wonderful place to restaurants eat, study spots study, or just hang out. The owner is very personable, knows the regulars, and treats every customer like a friend. And the hummus is BOMB.  :)   Users/Krissywissypoo

20120121 09:55:09 nbsp The Soda Cup I got had spiders spider webs on it. The guy Ali was a creep to the girls I came here with, staring like a perv. I will not be back.  Users/MikeMorrison

20120316 20:09:52 nbsp I love this place! As a vegetarians vegetarian its really hard to come by healthy filling meals at restaurants. Ali babas prices are great, and the food is amazing!!! Not to mention the super nice guy working behind the counter. The place looks great after the renovation work done not too long ago. I highly recommend the veggie platter. Its so big you and take home leftovers too! Users/NeeloferKarimyar

20120607 18:48:12 nbsp Great place to eat in Davis.  Been eating here for years on a weekly basis: feasibly priced and many options.  I havent eaten here for a couple months, however, since they changed the recipe of the veggie special.  Used to taste awesome, then it started tasting bad.  Anyone know if they switched back to the old recipe?  Users/ToddU
