What is an Alicia?

Alicia delights in creepy things.  She pretended to gnaw on my leg once and Ive since decided she would make for a terrifying zombie.

She has presence on the KDVS local airwaves as DJ Tigerlilly where she cohosts The Periodic Table of Fun with her life partner, Users/megswarts Meg.
