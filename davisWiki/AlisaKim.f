I GRADUATED! Still live in Davis, working in the Yang Lab and Williams Lab at UCDs Dept. of Entomology. I now spend a lot of time working but am still (sort of) living the college life, living in a house with 4 other people and picking up volunteer shifts at the Craft Center and the Student Farms as well has hopefully soon the Food Coop. You can now find me shopping at the Coop, at my house, working with some milkweeds on farms on the outskirts of Davis, driving all those random research roads on west campus, and only sometimes hiding.
