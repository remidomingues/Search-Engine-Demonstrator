I work at the Wildlife Health Center, part of School of Veterinary Medicine VetMed at UC Davis, doing their publications (print and electronic). I keep a blog, http://magpienest.org/feathersofhope/ Feathers of Hope, with my partner (we are Pica and Numenius there) which explores nature and place (and some baseball: go Giants!). We were founding members of the http://www.magpienest.org/scgibin/wiki.pl Ecotone Wiki.
