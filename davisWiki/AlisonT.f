20081029 14:52:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Alison and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the edit to the Gender and Sexuality Commission entry.  Many editors on the wiki are trying to keep a historical record, so Users/JasonAller Jason readded the 2007 commissioner list.  That was theres a sense of who came before in the future.  If you know any older commissioners, it would be great if you added them (or any history, either on that entry or anywhere else in the wiki).  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
