Platform Issues:

LIBRARY BUDGET CUTS AND ADVOCACY
I am concerned with divestment from our university’s libraries. Recent budget cuts have caused our library’s national ranking to drop dramatically. Though the cost of our education is increasing, the quality of our degrees is decreasing. I will write resolutions to support the efforts of the library worker’s union and student grassroots movement as well as advocate to administration to increase the library’s budget for longer hours, more books on reserve, and more subscriptions to scholarly journals.

MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT
I will also work to enhance student life on campus by advocating for increased publicity budgets for the ASUCD Entertainment Council and the KDVS campus radio station. I will work with Entertainment Council (EC) on innovative events that utilize free student resources like “Hometown Nights”: Concerts at Davis featuring bands from UCD student’s hometowns. Students can recommend groups from back home to come perform. I will aim to serve as the Senate Representative to the Campus Media Board, where I will focus on providing The Aggie with more advisors and opportunities for sensitivity training that will improve their journalistic practices.

ART AND DESIGN STUDENTS
As a former Design student, I have been personally affected by the budget cuts and decreased course offerings. As a senator, I will propose a special committee for Arts and Design to address the effect of budget cuts on these majors and institutionalize communication between Art and Design professors with the UCD bookstore. This committee should also help publicize art and design exhibits on campus to the larger UCD student population.

SERVE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS ON CAMPUS
As senator, I will introduce and support bills requesting funding for identity based community leadership retreats and culture weeks. I would like to write a senate bill to request funding to make a pregnant undergrad resource guide, which would be made available to student housing, the WRRC, and HEP. This resource guide will promote retention of pregnant undergrads by compiling all the resources available on campus for housing, childcare, lactation, and PELPing, information that is currently hidden under a web of bureaucracy. I will also work on programs to raise student awareness of the discriminatory practices of the FDA and blood drives on campus.

Any questions, concerns, or volunteers, please email me at: Alison4Senate@gmail.com

Thanks for your support!

 Official Candidate Ballot Statement 

Hello Everyone! My name is Alison Tanner. I am a third year Women & Gender Studies major, minoring in Writing, Education, and Political Science, and I am from San Jose, California. If elected senator I will work to advocate against cuts to our libraries, increase entertainment options on campus, and serve underrepresented communities on campus. For nearly two years I have served on the ASUCD Gender and Sexualities Commission, during which time I have acted as a liaison to the Entertainment Council and authored two Senate resolutions, which both passed unanimously. I have also devoted my time to volunteering at the Cross Cultural Center and the Women’s Resource and Research Center. I am prepared to serve our diverse student body as an ASUCD Senator and advocate for underrepresented communities on campus. I am concerned with divestment from our university’s libraries. Recent budget cuts have caused our library’s national ranking to drop dramatically. Though the cost of our education is increasing, the quality of our degrees is decreasing. I will write resolutions to support the efforts of the library worker’s union and student grassroots movement as well as advocate to administration to increase the library’s budget. As a former Design student, I have been personally affected by budget cuts and decreased course offerings. As a senator, I will propose a special committee for Arts and Design to address the effect of budget cuts and institutionalize communication between Art and Design professors with the UCD bookstore to decrease supply costs. This committee will also work to raise awareness in the general Davis community about free and lowcost entertainment on campus provided by these departments. I will also enhance student life on campus will by advocating for increased publicity budgets for the ASUCD Entertainment Council (EC) and the KDVS campus radio station. I will work with EC on innovative events that utilize free student resources like “Hometown Nights”: Concerts at Davis featuring bands from UCD student’s hometowns. Students can recommend bands from back home to come perform in Davis. Lastly, I hope to remain an advocate for underrepresented communities on campus. I would like to draft a Senate bill to fund the creation of a pregnant undergrad resource guide, to be made available to student housing and the WRRC, which will outline the resources available to students with families. I will also work on educational programs to raise awareness on campus about the discriminatory practices of the FDA and blood drives. Finally, I hope to work with TAPS to support commuter students by creating a system to display free spaces in the large parking structures, so students can spend less time searching for parking and more time in class. I will also introduce any funding bills presented to me by identitybased communities for leadership retreats and culture weeks. I am dedicated to creating change on the UC Davis campus and I know that, if given the chance, I can serve all students as your ASUCD Senator. Thank you.
