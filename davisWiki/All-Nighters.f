 Paperwriting 

Pulling an allnighter is a rite of passage that separates Procrastinating procrastinators from those students who study and write papers in a timely fashion.  The root of most Procrastinating procrastination is perfectionism.  OR laziness.  Or both.  But generally, even if a paper is due the next day, a Procrastinating procrastinating perfectionist wont even get started until late into the Night Time night, because he/she lacks the inspiration to write The perfect paper that perfect paper.  Inspiration and desperation, at a certain hour, become interchangeable.  So by about 3am, the wheels of creativity turn out 710 pages, double spaced.  So what if it has 1.5 margins and is in Courier, the largest font known to TrueType or Postscript fonts?

 Testtaking 

While allnighters can be essential for paperwriting, they are actually counterproductive for most types of studying.  If someone knows the material fairly well, and pulls an allnighter to perfect their knowledge, their ensuing loss of mental clarity due to lack of sleep probably morethanoffsets their increased knowledge due to a night of studying.  However, this can produce a net gain, if the student never actually went to class.
  I can attest from my undergrad days taking certain liberal arts classes that the cramming allnighter can be quite effective. If you are sufficiently motivated, you can in fact read 400 pages of psych text in two nights of reading, and still get an A on the material (assuming of course that there are 800 people in the class, so the only conceivable test type is multiple choice. Never try this if it is an essay test). Users/EricKlein
  Dude, actually reading 800 pages is the most inefficient way of studying for a psych test Ive ever heard of.  But okay, maybe it works for multiple choice tests. Users/JaimeRaba jr
  Well, perhaps, but it does work. If the only material for the class is the textbook, and youve already been to all the lectures and sections, then just reading all of the text actually crams quite a lot of useful test info into your head. Of course, I suspect this wouldnt work for most people, but I have a pretty good memory, and read fairly fast.  Users/EricKlein
  This strategy applies very well to HUM1 and SOC3. The finals are essays but you can get away with reading all the required text right before the final and get an A.  Users/TerencePhan
  From my degree in Psychology, I learned very early on about memory and cognition. The brain requires sleep in order for memories to solidify. Studies have been done that show that students who had a period of sleep in between studying and test taking scored higher on tests than students who stayed up all night studying. It seemed unusual at first that those who studied less the night before did better on tests. The period of sleep allowed the memories to be consolidated and resulted in better recall and better analytical thinking. The students who spent all night studying wasted their time by not getting memory solidifying sleep. In my other Psychology courses I also learned that studying small amounts throughout the quarter was better than waiting until the night before to study for tests. Psychology majors study smart not hard. We know all about memory techniques and reducing stress by not waiting until the last minute. Studying Psychology was never a chore, as it was something that I learned to apply throughout life. Studying a little everyday really made everything easier and then when the test came along, I already had everything down. I wish that more students would take Psychology courses. The information in many of the Psychology classes at Davis really changed my view of life and opened my eyes to everything from studying, to handling stress, life situations, dealing with other people, and even what to do with my life. Looking back, I wouldnt have changed a thing. I would be a totally different person if I had never taken all of those Psychology courses. Users/MaxLucas

 Sugar 
Unlike caffeine and other energy boosters, sugar has never been scientifically proven to give someone more energy than other carbohydrate rich foods (i.e. pasta) for even a short period of time (http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id1658232&page2 sugar does not make kids hyper story). However, some students still claim that sugar, if consumed in regular intervals, will keep you energized and awake.  However, if you fail to continually introduce sugar into your body, you will quickly become sleepy.  Essentially, your body reacts to a large dose of sugar by raising your insulin levels, which has the direct effect of fatigue and lethargy.

 Caffeine 
Caffeine is an essential part of maintaining the allnighter.  Unlike sugar, it can keep you going all night without the risk of sudden fatigue.  However one must be mindful of the caffeine source.  If someone drinks REGULAR soda, such as Mountain Dew or Coke, they run the risk of an insulin surge once the sugar is metabolized.  This CAN (although not necessarily) be dramatic enough an effect to offset the caffeine.  Some people describe the insulin versus caffeine reaction as very alert tiredness.  Diet soda, however, does not contain sugar.  While it tastes somewhat gross, if you drink it somewhat regularly, your taste buds will desensitize to its sharp aftertaste.  Another trick is to squeeze lemon or lime into your diet soda  you can also buy a bottle of RealLemon or RealLime. What matters with caffeine is that you use it consistently.  While this might not apply to an essay or project, it does for exams. If you study with caffeine, take the test with caffeine. Dont stay up studying with Coffee coffee and then take the test without it.

 Sugarfree caffeine sources 
   Diet soda
       Diet Mountain Dew  This citrusy soft drink contains enough lime flavor to make the aspartame undetectable.  It tastes slightly better than regular Mountain Dew because it has more lime and less orange flavor.
       Diet Red Bull  Tastes horrible.  Some people have other ideas.  However, highly effective.
       Some people claim that diet sodas containing Splenda makes them lethargic.
     A word of caution with diets and artificial sweeteners, they contain http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame Aspartame which may be more harmful to you than the mere effects of caffeine; seriously, this is bad stuff.
   NoDoze  be careful with these.  these can make your stomach hurt SO bad.
   Careful with these. As few as 20 can kill some people. :)
   Tea  Avoid caffeinefree tea.  Theoretically the caffeine in tea has a slightly different molecular composition than caffeine in other things.  It affects certain people somewhat differently. Green tea gives less of crash after the caffeine wears off as compared to coffee.
   Black coffee  or add a nonsugar sweetener.
   Espresso shots  very effect, but be wary of upset tummies.
   Chocolate covered espresso beans  great idea, but watch out for the sugar content.
   Excedrin  advanced medicine for pain.  Has plenty of caffeine.  Dont take too much, but it also helps take care of the headache and neckache you probably have already.

 Exercise 
Though it sounds bizarre, one way to quickly get your endorphins pumping and your adrenaline shooting through your body is to exercise. Going on a quick jog for about 15 minutes can get you wired for awhile, and make it difficult to fall asleep even if you try. A jog followed by an energy drink or another dose of Caffeine caffeine can leave you wired for hours.  This is also a great way to wake yourself up if you catch yourself falling asleep as the words in your reading become blurred, or you are making multiple typos in your attempt for The Perfect Paper the perfect paper. Be careful: know your limits. If you are extremely out of shape, then maybe try an 8 minute jog or so. Whatever you do, dont go for an intense workout that will tire you out, just one that will keep you on your toes.

 Sleep 
A Quick Nap is theoretically possible.  Some allnight avatars can actually take 45 minute power naps so they can sustain themselves all night without the use of additives.  However, most people cannot do this.  This ultimately causes people to sleep through alarms and miss finals, deadlines and other horrible consequences.  This ultimately results in claims of rare, spontaneous illnesses and the http://www.cis.gsu.edu/~dstraub/Courses/Grandma.htm death of grandparents quarter after quarter. Food poisoning is a popular one, due to its unprovable nature.  (Some purists claim that even a short nap takes away the honorable designation of pulling an allnighter.)
  I once stayed up for two nights straight working on a final project for a class. I finished the project at 8am on the morning it was due (I had to present at 11am or so), so I went home to have a shower. After the shower, I sat down on the bed, and the next thing I knew, it was 12:30, well after class was over. Quite luckily, my professor had a sense of humor about it, and since I went straight to his office to present it to him in person, everything worked out OK, but still the stuff nightmares are made of. Moral of the story: if you REALLY need to stay up, dont ever do anything that could even make you comfortable enough to fall asleep. Once you are tired enough to have your mind spontaneously stop thinking, sleep can strike at any time. Users/EricKlein
  Ive found anything less than three hours is worse than not sleeping at all, since it just makes you crave what youre missing and slows down your spinning head. Plus the sleep is always fitful with dreams about failing to wakeup again.  Users/AmeliaCarlson aec
  I agree.  Three hours can work wonderfully, though.  Its long enough to refresh your mind to some degree, as you can actually dream during three hours  expect dreams about your paper though.  Ive never actually pulled an allnighter, due to the fact that I usually think sleep deprivation effects will be worse.  But this Friday I went to sleep at 3AM, woke up at 6AM, finished my project, and still managed to stay awake until 1AM the next day.  Note that when you wake up, youll probably want to take a hot shower to start up your metabolism.  Users/BrentLaabs

Users/KrisFricke

All nighters can be really valuable for getting things done, but make sure what youre staying up for is due the next day.  Many have fallen ill to pointless all nighers!  This is especially likely to happen if you skip class a lot.

One trick I use for staying awake during those late nights is chewing peppermint gum. Peppermint is a natural stimulant, and it works if you need to wake up quickly. I also use Burts Bees lip balm (with peppermint) regularly. Users/AnnaHamilton

20060214 17:03:21 nbsp Under 30 minutes or above 3 hours any amount of sleep in the middle just makes you groggy. Of course, the accidental allnighter is best: absorbed in the material or working in the studio, you realize its starting to get light outside and youre ravenously hungry. Users/TorreyaCummings

20060317 06:24:06 nbsp Thanks for the Advice....This week has been a string of All Nighters for me, and as its 6:15 am right now, you can see that I just finished one. Luckily i slept from 5am to 5pm yesterday, giving me the energy to be awake from 5 to 6... Users/MaxMikalonis

20070207 02:19:17 nbsp I had more allnighters than sleep nights in high school.  College is awesome, I sleep more.  This is only my 4th all nighter but its hard to keep track sometimes...I heart calculus. Users/GregWebb

20080506 06:08:22 nbsp Im on one right now.  The sun is coming up and I feel fine, and all Ive had is some Powerade.  I think the trick is that when you feel yourself drifting away, indulge yourself, but only for a short nap.  I crashed at 2 and awoke at 3 feeling refreshed, and I still am.  But I guess I wont know how effective this session has been until the test, which is still over four hours away. Users/RichardYeh

20080712 13:14:36 nbsp I once stayed awake for 5 days in order to get a project done.  My friends told me that I was going insane and forced me to sleep.  I found afterward that I had been talking to inanimate objects and the conversation was less then coherent. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
