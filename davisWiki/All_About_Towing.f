All About Towing is one of several businesses in Davis to provide towing services. If your car breaks down, you may want to call them to tow it to an automobile repair auto shop. Visit their web site at http://www.allabouttowing.us.  At the request of a property owner or the police, they may also tow and store your vehicle if it is parked illegally.

20061202 16:57:37 nbsp Avoid this company at all costs.  The driver (and presumably the owner) is a complete jerk, and takes any and every opportunity to levy charge after charge on college students who dont have a spare $300 laying around.  If your car is towed on Friday night, you have the choice to wait until Monday to pick it up, in which case hell charge you for two days of storage, or if you want it back the next morning, hell charge you an afterhours fee, which ends up costing the same as leaving it there all weekend.

20070529 03:52:32 nbsp Cruel company! Their fees are ridiculous!
In my apt complex, there are a few parking spots that serve as Future Resident Parking until 6pm, when they become normal guest spots. I parked there on a Saturday at 5:47pm thinking it was only going to be a few minutes till 6 anyway. Well at 6:12pm, I noticed my car was gone. The only way they knew I wasnt a future resident was because the leasing office was closed at the time!
I really felt sorry for the owner of the red car parked next to me. When I was out in the parking lot, the tow truck returned to remove the red car, which was parked next to mine.  It was as if the tow truck driver took down the license plate of the red car before 6pm, towed my car, then came back AFTER 6pm to tow the other car!
I understand that I broke the rules a little and parked where I shouldnt have but how could these moneygrubbers be so stiff!? When I went to bail my car out, I had to pay almost $300 in towing & storage fees because I couldnt pick it up till Monday.  They were so rude too. They acted so cold and really treated me like a criminal.. I guess I was a criminal in a way, but youd think they could give some college students a break, especially for parking 13 minutes in an office spot.
Oh why couldnt Johnnys Towing Service tow me instead?  Users/BenjaminCatabas

20071114 12:00:41 nbsp Most people never have their vehicles towed and stored. We are called the bad guys and many other things by the owners of the vehicles that get towed and stored.  It is the poor decisions that the vehicle owners make that lead to the vehicle being towed.  If the irresponsible owner fails to renew their registration, drives while intoxicated, or drives without a license the police departments will have us tow the vehicle.  We are the good guys to the police departments who keep our roadways safe.  If the inconsiderate driver parks in a restricted location, they should expect that their vehicle will be towed.  We are the good guys to businesses who want to provide parking spaces to their customers.  We are the good guys to tenants who want access to their reserved parking spaces.  We are the good guys to apartment complex managers that need to get the fire lanes open for emergency equipment and the handicapped spaces open for people with special needs.

As to the postings on this web site, we do not show that we ever towed a vehicle for Cameron Young, Steve Carson, Jeff Ito or Ann Thi Nguyen (possibly the same person with different aliases).  We do show that we towed Erick Boehm’s and Benjamin Catabas’s vehicles.  The tenant on Drake Drive that pays for the reserved parking space requested that we tow Erik’s car out of their space.  The manager of the apartment complex on 5th Street had us tow Benjamin’s car for parking in a reserved space.

Yes, towing rates are expensive, but operating a towing business is expensive, especially in Davis.  Real estate is expensive.  Business and residential rental rates, insurance, gasoline, vehicle maintenance and repair, wages, and providing 24/7 service are also expensive.  Consequently it is expensive to live and operate a business in Davis.

So bottom line, it is the driver’s poor decisions that initiate their vehicle being towed.  Obey the laws and heed the warning signs and your car won’t be towed.  If you make the wrong choices, your vehicle may be towed.  If your vehicle is towed, it will be expensive to get it back, but stop complaining and take responsibility for your actions.  But most importantly, make the right decisions and you will probably never have your vehicle towed.

    I agree people should be considerate & not park in assigned spaces but Office Parking hours were from 6am6pm. Offices closed at 4pm on Saturdays (Perhaps Greystone shouldve given me my money back). I parked at 5:47. My tow receipt says I was towed at 6pm. I thought I was past this little incident but I found my receipt while cleaning my desk today... and whenever I see that $280, its dumb but it still really pops my corn! Users/BenjaminCatabas

If you were towed illegally, the property owner who had you towed is liable for twice what you were charged (dont take it out on the tow truck guys, theyre just doing as asked).
If you catch them towing you before they leave the property, they must release your vehicle for half price (if you ask).
If they damage your vehicle, they are liable for repairs. Users/JenniferKucich

20081104 14:18:24 nbsp I actually had a really great experience with this company this morning.  My car was towed last night due to the assholes at Cartridge World, and they released my vehicle to me for free because they said their driver only waited 58 minutes to tow my vehicle and he had to wait 60 minutes.  I think they were really just being nice due to the amount of times I called them and was fighting my case. Users/AllanRae

20090115 14:59:50 nbsp $220 to tow a car a few blocks is excessive.  The problem is, the people who ask for a vehicle to be towed dont care how much it costs, and the vehicle owner has no control over the price of the towing.  Therefore... Randy can charge whatever the heck he wants without having anyone regulate his pricing.  There should be oversight for businesses like this.   Users/MTills

I disagree. If someone had the right to tow you, as in, you were in their spot that they probably pay for, then you deserve to be towed. I towed people at Greystone because I would have had someone in my spot everyday if I didnt. Seriously, be considerate. AmLin
Yeah, people really shouldnt park in reserved spots.. they do deserve to be towed. However, I can think of 3 times when I went door to door asking who parked in my spot because Id rather they moved their car rather than deal with the nightmare that is All About Towing. I say: use towing as a deserved consequence, but also as a last resort.

20090424 15:21:23 nbsp All About Incompetence: they towed my car even though Im a RESIDENT with a VALID PERMIT! I live in Allegre Apartments and recently got a new car. I dont have license plates for it yet, so I got a temporary permit from the office until the plates come in. I put the permit in clear and plain sight and it explicitly states Allegre Temporary Parking Permit with a permit number on it. Whats more? Just two nights before, I caught one of their workers looking at my car around 1 a.m. with a flashlight. I walked up to him and he asked me if it was my car. When I said yes, he went on to explain to me how I needed a permit to park there. I just pointed to the temporary permit on the windshield and went back inside to my place. Then just last night, I decided to walk outside to check on my car, and it was gone. I immediately knew what happened, called the tow company, and went to retrieve my car at about 2 a.m. They didnt charge me anything because they knew it was their mistake.

The guy who towed my car gave me some BS excuse about how they werent familiar with the temporary permit. The funny thing is, I had my moms 10 year old car up here for two weeks which also had a temporary permit, and that car magically never got towed. I feel like they try to prey on new cars because they need some way to make money and they bank on the chance that people wont get their permits right away. Even if theyre not familiar with the permit, I would hope these people at the minimum know how to read. Half of the fault should probably go to their equally incompetent partners, the Patrol Plus rentacops, who were most likely the ones who called in the tow company on my car. What a mess.

On the plus side, they resister you once you get towed, so if they tow you again, they will call you.  Users/tmmeadow

20100211 17:24:28 nbsp Last I checked, a company presenting an authorization to tow a car from a complex under a general Authorization agreement with the complex CANNOT be an affiliate of the tow company that performs the service. This is outlined in California Vehicle Code 22658 linked at the top of the page.
What they do is the complex contracts out with Patrol Plus to authorize tows of invalid vehicles afterhours. By law, they need to make a written authorization to tow. In theory, Patrol Plus patrols the complexes they have contract with and calls in the tow when they find a violator. What actually happens (Per admittance of a tow operator) is that the tow company does the patrolling, finds a violator, and calls Patrol Plus to give them authorization to tow. I have caught them in the act doing it and they have openly admitted it before two other witnesses.
CVC 22658 is your best friend, learn it, know it, love it, it is written VERY specifically to protect you from abusive towing. Users/edwin.nielsen
  I dont see how it is abusive towing if there was a parking violation. The law seems to have just forced apartment complexes to hire a middleman that does not get paid on the number of cars towed. A better solution would be to let people whose cars get towed for ridiculous reasons take the towing company to court for a sum of money that provides compensation for lost wages and inconvenience. This way, complexes wont have to pay for a service that they really do not need if towing companies do the patrolling and only use Patrol Plus to get authorization. Getting rid of the middleman would not cause any problems if towers have to be able to prove that the car towed was in violation or else risk losing a large sum of money. The cost is probably passed onto renters as well. Just two cents from an advocate of the devil. Users/hankim

20100211 19:18:39 nbsp Abuse is because the intent of the law is that the landlord (or agent of) requests the tow. So, an advocate of the tenants (who pay to keep the place running and maintained) keeps unauthorized cars out. This should imply that an advocate for tenants should be able to notify the tenants if their car is being towed. Whereas an associate of the tow company would have no knowledge or access to such knowledge as to if it is a tenants car being towed or not. That is the purpose of that part of the law, and the exact kind of abuse taking place in Davis now with these two companies. The laws writing was to prevent the no permit  tow mentality of patrolling tow trucks, but now all they do is have a 3rd party authorizing it. edit: and how the hell do you do that bullet replay, anyway?Users/edwin.nielsen
  You just double click the text and edit. You need to put an asterisk before the text though. If the towing company were to call the agent of the apartment complex for authorization to tow a car, should the agent not inform the towing company if the car belongs to a resident or not if the apartment complex wanted tenant cars to be able to park without a permit? Apartment complexes do warn residents that cars without a parking permit will get towed. Because this is specifically stated in the parking lot, towing a car without a permit does not seem like abuse, even if the car belongs to a tenant. And if the cars of residents were kept from being towed even if the car is without a permit, this just opens up the parking lot to abuse by residents who decide to let their friends borrow their passes for a while, which in turn inconveniences others who are actually authorized to use the lot.  Users/hankim
   My impression is that the problem isnt that cars without permits get towed, but that a tow truck company is the one doing the patrolling.  Predatory towing is incredibly common and there have been several attempts in the state legislature to curtail it.  If I recall correctly, an illegal tow makes the tow company liable for something like 4x the bill.  The problem, unfortunately, is that you have to pay them to get your car back, even if they towed illegally.  If you dont pay it, they can sell your car after 30 days, apply the proceeds from the sale toward the bill you owe them (I think the legal limit is something like $70 or 80 per day in the lot, plus a couple hundred for the initial tow), and then send the remaining balance to collections.  Towing companies have a LOT of protection which makes it incredibly easy for them to abuse their power.  If you see one violating the law, you should absolutely report them.  If you personally get screwed by them, you should have a word with the CA Attorney Generals office, the BBB, and of course the DPD. Users/TomGarberson
    I know the problems that can arise from predatory towing. That is why I believe that wrongfully towing a car should have such a huge punishment that towing companies would think twice before doing something stupid. I just dont think that towing a car without a permit, especially if signs are everywhere, is predatory. Users/hankim

20100219 16:14:23 nbsp In response to Edwin,as an employee of All About Towing I resent the implication that anything was, or is done outside the guidelines of cvc 22658,in the course of our providing service to the complexes we service.We patrol disabled spaces, firelanes, entrances and exits, and yes resident only throughout the night so tenants that have a right to park in the spaces set appart for them, can. We are the best friend your car has if you properly display your parking permit your managment provided you.The intent of the legislation revising cvc 22658 was to insure the tow is authorized by the management or agent at the time tow, and that the price charged is accordance with all law enforcement towing and storage fees.

20101015 14:14:12 nbsp Dear Edwin thanks a lot for posting your comments here. The problem is the weakness of CA law in regard of towing; unfortunately CA law does not apply much more restricted law about towing as some other states do. There are many technicality codes in state law that the judges in small claim court are not beware of, or not train for. Also since the counties collect business taxes from these companies it is much difficult to win your case in the court. Also plaintiff has a difficult time to challenge the judge. Personally I believe that the state should apply more restricted law for towing and increase the fine of illegal tow by at least 20x the bill. In this case 20X of the original bill would be $ 4400 which provides the plaintiff with better opportunities to spend money on attorney for consultation. As it is obvious in this page the company does lots of violations and fraud. In CA and most part of the USA we need a towing reform.    Users/joedavis

20110301 13:58:43 nbsp I think this is the towing company that patrols the Hoa Viet lot. If it is, back in late 2007 they definitively violated CVC 22658 (h), charging over $220 dollars when they hadnt even started to tow the car yet. CVC 22658 clearly states that they are not allowed to charge storage fees and are only allowed to charge half of the actual towing charge unless your vehicle has started transit. I later found out that their towing fee was only around $180, so legally all they could charge was $90 not the full $180 plus a $40 storage fee. This is a lesson, know the CVC 22658 before parking in this town. We parked the car in front of the restaurant while they were closed in the morning and were going to eat at the restaurant right when they opened for lunch. We arrived to the spot right before the restaurant opened to watch our car getting attached to a tow truck. Not sure if this was the restaurants fault or the tow truck companies fault, but they shouldnt be allowed to tow paying customers, and certainly not brake the law by violating CVC 22658 h.

20110517 16:17:05 nbsp I was in an automobile accident on a busy overpass in Davis. Your driver, Mark, made a bad situation quite tolerable. He arrived at the scene within minutes and handled the situation with expertise.  He quickly got my truck out of the busy intersection and was concerned with my safety. He then went out of his way to explain my towing options. He was very professional, knowledgeable and careful towing my vehicle. My vehicle was towed out of town, so I was his passenger for a long haul. Mark made me feel totally at ease throughout the entire ordeal. I would highly recommend Mark for your towing needs.
 Users/DLP

20110523 01:38:16 nbsp If you are having automobile troubles, call these guys. My motorcycle and I got in a wreck last week and Mark was kind enough to tell me my options (pay now vs later, warning of storage fees at his lot, etc).  He was very understanding, and walked me through everything. He also only charged me for 30 minutes of labor instead of a full hour.

If your vehicle is towed because you parked where you werent supposed to, please understand that they are just doing their job. But if youre in trouble and need a tow, theyre professional, personable, and more than reasonable on price.   Users/CelesteIi

This was my second towing from them and my car was just there for 2 days and I did not receive any notification. Had they called or notified me somehow, I would have really appreciated it since I would have saved money on the storage fees. But overall, they maintained their professionalism, were organized and friendly, and even apologized I hadnt been transferred to someone that could help me right away when I first called (the lady said to call back later when someone would be in the office). No damages done to my car either, so Im glad about their service in that respect. And just a note, they dont accept checks, so make sure you have cash or a credit/debit card on hand!

20110807 13:56:59 nbsp I called All About Towing last night when my car died.  They were very friendly on the phone, and quoted me a price.  Mark, the tow guy, arrived very quickly and was extremely helpful.  He offered to try a jump first (which was a reduced cost), before towing.  The jump didnt work out, but Mark stuck to his original price quote, and did not add on any extra fees for jumping the car.  He is also full of stories and quite entertaining, making a lousy situation not feel so bad.  In the end, he also gave me a ride home.  Overall, I found this towing company to be fast, friendly, reliable and professional.  Of course, if you park somewhere where you are not allowed to park, you should probably expect that you will be paying for a tow.  That is just the way it works.  Read the signs. Users/BrookeRoberts

I finally called All About Towing, and they said they could help out right away.  The person that assisted me, Mark, was there within 20 minutes, and he drove from Vacaville.  He was patient while we waited for a friend to pick up others in my car and take them back to Davis.  We then went and dropped my car off at a repair shop in Davis, and even gave me a ride back home.  He even took care of the paperwork so this could be covered by my insurance company.  Overall it was a great relief to be helped out so fast by their staff and by someone nice and professional like Mark, who really went out of his way to help.  Dont hesitate to contact them first, and directly, if you run into any trouble! Users/MHess

  Glen, I am a little confused about your posting.  I have a few questions.  First, what city and state are you located in?   Second, in California, to lawfully tow a vehicle from a parking lot, the owner of the property, their representative or a tenant in control of the property must request the tow and then sign for having the vehicle towed.  Do you own, manage or rent the property?    Third, when an unauthorized vehicle is towed and stored from private property, the towing company will bill the registered owner of the vehicle for the fees.    Fourth, do you own the cars?  If not, why would the towing company return the vehicles to you and not the registered owners?  Fifth, have you contacted your local law enforcement agency?  They may be able to help you.

20140127 08:30:27 nbsp My tire got shredded on the freeway, I called for assistance and Mark responded very quickly. He put on the spare and then we moved to a safe location to complete paperwork. Mark was very professional and concerned with my safety. He was knowledgeable and recommended a place nearby to get my tire replaced. It was a great experience. Users/reneemcsweeney

20140129 13:31:04 nbsp Great company!  They proved to be true to their logo, Fast, Friendly Service.  I was having one of THOSE mornings this morning!  You know the kind?! The kind of morning when you are already late for work, and then you go and lock your keys in your car!!  It was not until I safely dropped my daughter off at school that I realized on my walk back to my car that I did not have my keys!  Much to my dismay, I quickly realized that I had locked them in my car by accident in my rush!  Luckily I still had my cell phone in my pocket so I could call my insurance company. Well, my insurance company told me it would be 2 hours before they could get someone out to help me!  I could not wait 2 hours, so I goggled roadside assistance davis ca and All About Towing came up.  I called them and they assured me that they could indeed help retrieve my keys out of my locked car!  They charged a small fee to do so, but well worth it!  Mark arrived to help me within 10 minutes, with a friendly demeanor, and had me on my way back to work a.s.a.p.!  I would definitely recommend this company to help you with any roadside assistance you may need! Users/Shaninis

20140302 20:50:08 nbsp First of all I would like to say that Mark provided a very fast, friendly service.  I locked my keys in the car, I called my road side service and I was informed that it was going to take 45 minutes.  I gave them my address.  Marked called me shortly to confirm my address, he asked me if I was in a safe spot and I told him that I was but I was cold and my keys were locked in the car.  He told me not to worry and that he would make it ASAP.  He actually  made it within 15 minutes, instead of the original 45 that my road side service said.  He was not creepy or annoying at all.  He was very respectful, friendly, and provided great service.  I would highly recommend Mark to anyone.   Users/almaerojas

20140325 14:41:36 nbsp My experience with All About Towing was nothing but positive! After having to deal with a dead car followed by useless roadside assistance, I called All About Towing to help get my car to the nearest repair shop. Mark Wohlgemuth showed up at my apartment complex at his earliest convenience and was immediately helpful and friendly. He talked to my insurance company so that I wouldnt have to pay for the second assistance call outofpocket, was kind enough to give my car a jump and assess the battery and alternator, and even followed me to the repair shop to make sure that my car made it there without any issues. Mark was extremely understanding of my situation and made the whole ordeal much less stressful overall. I definitely know who Ill be calling if I run into any more car problems in the future. Thank you!! Users/nicmik

20140523 17:22:38 nbsp I ran out of gas today on the freeway in Davis like a knucklehead.  I thought I could make it, but I didnt.  Anyways, used google and found All About Towing and gave them a call.  I got a response to my location in less than ten minutes!  Very nice!  Mark gave me gas, directed me to the next exit and finished up my payment in a safe location off the freeway.  All in all, Mark saved my ass today...thank you brother.

I must say, I was pretty alarmed to see all the knucklehead posts above whining about towing and storage fees.  Im not that old, but the entitlement exhibited makes me Lee Trevino.  Hey kids...park legally, immediately pick your car up if you get towed and thank your mom and dad for paying for your tuition, room, board, car, tow fees, etc... Users/DaveReece

20140731 12:42:11 nbsp Mark is the best! He got to my car in about 10 minutes after I called which really saved me some nerves while I was freaking out on the parking lot wondering what is that smoke coming off my car! I really appreciate that he wasnt only professional, but also super friendly, which is very important in such stressful situation. On the way to the repair shop, Mark gave me a lot of good advises about  local car services and how to take care of my car, which I thought is really nice since I just moved here and dont know anyone. Thank you Mark! I highly recommend All about towing to everyone!  Users/IrinaKoryakina
