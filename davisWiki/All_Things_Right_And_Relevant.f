All Things Right And Relevant is a large consignment store in which all profits go towards funding mental health programs in Yolo County. Its partnered with the R & R Thrift next door. It has a novel pricing system where every tag has three prices each associated with a date range. The longer an item sits on the shelf, the cheaper it is.  If the item expires (passes the latest date on the tag) or isnt of high enough quality, it goes next door to R & R Thrift.

They stock furniture, collectibles, as well as clothing for men, women and children.  They also sell a generous selection of Sees candies.

The store is operated by mental health clients.

 Consigning 

Consigning is a quick and easy way to get a little money from items you no longer need or want.

R&R accepts gift quality items for consignment. Clothing should be in excellent condition, clean, pressed, and in season and style.  Nonclothing items should be in good repair, clean, and free of dust and dirt.

They do not accept unframed prints, bed parts and mattresses, used computers, televisions, fax machines, other electronic equipment, used electrical equipment, nonfunctional appliances, radio and stereo equipment, telephones or answering machines, typewriters, hair dryers, curling irons, childrens toys with wheels or multiple parts, or anything with a value less than $2.00. They only accept 10 things per person, per consignment day. They also only accept seasonal clothing (i.e. no winter clothing accepted in spring).

Anything that doesnt meet consignment guidelines is considered a donation to R&R. They do not review items at the time of consignment, so dont consign anything youre not prepared to donate! You can call to get your consignment balance over the phone.

Normal consignment hours are Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday from 11:00 until 1:00 and again on Thursday from 67 p.m. if they have space in the store.  Go to the consignment door (between them and R&R Thrift), get a pink (for clothing) or blue (for everything else) consignment sheet, and fill it out. You can take extras home to fill out ahead of time, or print the sheet off of their website (www.rrconsignments.org). Put clothing on the clear plastic hangers provided, then hang them on the rack inside the door (or wherever the volunteers direct you). Pin the consignment sheet to one of the items with a provided clothespin.

Proceeds from the sale of consigned items are split 46/54 between the consignor and R&R, respectively. This is calculated using the actual cost the item sold for, so if it sells on a sale day, youll get less. Payment is made via cash or check at the register. If your item is not sold, you may pick it up anytime within 29 days from the time its consigned. After 29 days, they become property of R&R.

20090724 22:21:31 nbsp I havent sold anything on consignment here but I do want to put in a plug for this shop because they have nice stuff and take the time to organize and arrange it well.  I also like the sliding scale price where it goes down after a certain date.  I shop here, even with higher prices than other thrift stores, because I like that they support a variety of local organizations and even staff some members who benefit from those organizations.  I think it is fine they are picky about protocol on how to make a donation, it saves everybodys time in the long run! Thanks for being in Davis, R&R. Users/dandysgirl

20091013 14:21:26 nbsp I gave Right and Relevant some of my clothes to sell on consignment.  When I went to check on my items they were not on the racks (I searched every piece of clothing in the place) and they had not sold the items that were missing.  Basically I had two pairs of shoes and a pair of designer jeans stolen.  I told a family friend who used to volunteer there and she told me it happens there all the time.  The employees are aware of the problem and they even know who the thieves are.  They feel if people are stealing they really must need the items.  Hey managementif people are selling their clothes they must need the money as well.  Also, do people in need, need to have designer jeans and expensive shoes?  There is a thrift store right next store.  I warn you, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CLOTHES!  The store Nina and Tom, located at 129 E Street, just recently started doing consignment.  When I took clothes to Nina and Tom they sold two pieces in the first hour they were there!!  Once again, if you dont want your clothes stolen DO NOT GO TO ALL THING RIGHT AND RELEVANT! Users/Bear47

20091103 06:18:39 nbsp I am new at consigning with R & R and I have to agree with most of the comments. I have consigned brand new merchandise with tags and very slightly worn clothing, only to not see it on the racks or on my account.  I am saddened by this type of business because I drive pretty far for the cause. Also, the last couple of times I have been in there they have not been giving out print outs on what has been sold.  Shame, Shame, Shame Users/jackieshowel

20091120 14:51:43 nbsp I dont consign, I just brought stuff there and was happy to find a used Coach bag for $8! :) They do have great stuff sometimes.  Users/val

20091203 07:23:02 nbsp I am really grateful that Nina and Tom have realized how much Davis needed a better consignment store. They tell you what theyll take right at the door and call you if your things dont sell. Its a much more honest model (and I think as a result theyre going to attract more and more of the better clothing in Davis used clothing supply). No one has to worry about their best consignments being pilfered anymore! Users/calvin2

20100107 20:29:30 nbsp I have been in here several times.  The selection is not very good and it is pricey because it is consignment shop.  The clothes are usually cheaper brands and more for an older crowd. Go to SPCA thrift.  R&R is a much better space, but the selection at SPCA is far better.   By the way, the employees here are not very friendly at all.  Often they wont even acknowledge you when you enter or are shopping in the store.  Users/stodd84

20100127 17:46:01 nbsp They offered to hold my bicycle pannier, which they referred to as a No Backpack Policy backpack, at the counter while I shopped. I declined their offer and left instead. I guess they can be added to the list of businesses that it isnt convenient to shop at if you are on bike and dont have a car to leave you possessions in. Users/JasonAller

20100127 17:53:19 nbsp I cant imagine why anyone would ever consign anything here, as they say right up front that they basically feel that they have the right to just take anything they want for any reason and call it a donation.

Not a bad place to shop, however.  I bought a very nice silver dish here for a very good price.  Im guessing it was a donation. Users/rfrazier

20100128 18:00:43 nbsp I am currently volunteering here and I am impressed at how many people actually shop/ consign here. I didnt know this place existed until about a month ago. Just to clear up some stink on the consignments. The volunteers/ staff who are determining whether or not your items are worthy for consignment are very honest people. I personally have witnessed the process they go through to decide whether or not the items will be consigned. A lot of the time there are good items declined because the consignee failed to make sure the clothing was washed etc. If the clothing has anything wrong with it, they will not put it on the floor to sell.

20100217 14:21:00 nbsp All Things Right and Relevant is grateful for the chance to respond to the concerns expressed in wiki’s comments
Our employees and volunteers work to process an enormous number of items within a 24hour period. Many items consigned are not acceptable. Even new items with tags can be rejected for stains, missing buttons or broken zippers. We do not accept these items in R&R Thrift; they are sent to other charities.
We are trying to accommodate our consigners by offering them a precheck so consignors will know which items are accepted for consignment.
We have taken away the consignment fees.
We are addressing theft issues, including, beginning in March, monitoring our dressing rooms.
If problems arise, tell us. We may not be able to solve everything, but if you don’t tell us what’s wrong, we can’t solve anything.
Come in and ask to speak to the manager.

20100217 18:34:11 nbsp I started volunteering at R&R almost a year ago.  It has been an extremely positive experience for me. I have met customers, employees, and other volunteers most of whom feel like a warm and welcoming family. The people who work there are honest, caring, and really conscientious about consignors items and issues. In this busy place it is common to hear people say this is my favorite store. I also consign some things occasionally and have never been treated unfairly.  Im impressed by R&Rs response to some pretty harsh criticism. They are actively and openly addressing issues while continuing to keep their focus on the mental health programs they help fund. Im proud and grateful to work there. Thanks R&R!  Barb Users/BBBMac

20100323 13:45:16 nbsp Youve heard of Nightmare on Elm St? R&R is nightmare on 8th St.  Truth is I really do like buying things there, but they are so anal about the rules there that its ridiculous!  And the rules change....sometimes arbitrarily. I have a friend who use to volunteer there and felt like they were sticklers with the rules for consigners but then priced and placed things in a very unfair manner.  I just spend over and hour there trying to consign stuff and then they would not let me use $1.20 that was in my account because I didnt have my ID with me (thats the first time theyve asked for ID in 8 years). Then when I started to get upset about the process, the staffer trying to sound empathic but sounding more like a psychology parody said, you seem like youre having a hard day. LOL  Well, duh...  I felt the precious minutes of my life being wasted....Time for a new game plan! Users/deetales

20100711 07:10:21 nbsp I havent sold anything here, though I have at My Sisters Closet in Woodland, so I get the jist.
Even though I KNOW its a consignment shop, why, oh why, was there a $3,000 CHAIR IN THERE?! It wasnt vintage, it had no stats on why it should be that much. Whaaat. Someones asking for way too much. I did however, find a nice faux leather (nonbranded, though :/) teal purse there for like $8, that was a really bitchin deal. Users/Mogitha

20100716 17:24:42 nbsp Caution! I consigned a beautiful new coat here, with the tags still on, and it disappeared. Based on comments below I believe that staff/volunteers grabbed it and returned it to the store I bought it at, pocketing the money. I dont go there anymore, which is a shame because they do have a lot of nice stuff. Users/JasperD

20130630 01:17:03 nbsp I got a lot of nice maternity clothes here when I was pregnant. Users/AmyHuey

20140204 12:33:50 nbsp Just completed my first consignment experience...and Im delighted!  It was quick and easy to submit my 20 items over the course of two days, and I just picked up a check for $55. Way better than a yard sale!!  Users/Linda
