This is the userpage that represents Allegre Management. They have been asked not to use organizational accounts but only care about the business they work for... Ergo Jaymes Latch and Pat Michelier use this account to whitewash the Allegre page and respond to any comments or questions posted on the Alegre page.  We also have James Rocha and Ryan Rocha who work maintenance and may work in the office from time to time.

If you have any questions or concerns, PLEASE CALL US or come straight to the office.  We are very big about communication here, and it is easier for us to work on the personal level so that we may accurately diagnose and solve any problems or issues you may have.

Tell Ryan I said Hi Daubert


20100108 14:55:21 nbsp Please be careful with your use of terms like slander. It has a very specific meaning that Im sure your lawyer can explain to you. For future reference, defamation put into a fixed form is libel. In any case, unnecessarily and incorrectly invoking law around here is frowned upon.

Anyway, if you have documentation that information someone posted here is false, by all means post it. If you have sued someone and won over something they posted here, reference the case. Merely saying that something is wrong and you have proof and not presenting the proof is not enough to remove somebodys edits unless they are clearly false standing on their own. You are free to rebut anything anyone says and I suggest you do so where you feel that is appropriate rather than just deleting things you dont like.

20100519 17:03:29 nbsp I have seen some people who have dogs here.... Users/cutechristine

20100717 15:50:06 nbsp This is an account that is run by the two managers of Allegre, they promise to use it for Allegre related updates only. Previously this was used by female employee of Allegre and she does not reflect in any ways shape or form the current management Users/StevenDaubert
  The problem with that is that they have as much identity as Users/AllegreSucks does at that point. I dont think it is fair to complain about anonymous one hit wonders when employees hide behind the role accounts that JabberWokky has nicely stated create an aura of exceptional voice. Users/JasonAller

20101001 09:54:30 nbsp Hello! I noticed that you said something on one of your edits that implied that you would delete someone elses comment if they didnt add more info, or something like that. Just a heads up: that comment will get readded. Youre doing a good job by responding to the comments, and I think it will show people that the management is responsive and tries very hard to fix problems, but deleting comments will only look bad and make people mistrust the management more. Users/JoePomidor
     In order for DavisWiki to be effective (especially in the case of a vendor), dont you think that comments should have a direction and purpose when they are posted?  I would rather see negative comments than vague comments, because I can respond effectively to a negative comment and rectify the issue.  With a vague comment, Im not sure what I can do and all it does is make the place look bad, nothing else.  If the poster has a legitimate reason for making us look bad, that sucks, but thats a reality that we cannot escape.  Richard

20101018 19:26:13 nbsp AllegreApartmentsplease be aware Users/Reneng did NOT want his comments removed. I am restoring them. Users/PeterBoulay

20101018 20:01:07 nbsp Richard—the apartment page is not your page. It is a community based page and the person referenced in the previous notes Users/Reneng requested the comments be restored so I assisted him. We have no way of identifying which Users/Reneng it is. Your issue is with the person who requested itplease direct your concern there: Users/Reneng. Thx for the note. Users/PeterBoulay

20101018 20:10:04 nbsp Hey, Richard.  I created a very simple, starting entry for JCA Management, Inc..  Its based on what I could find, but Im sure you know more that could expand on what is there (or correct the assumption that JCA only handles Allégre).  Id normally do a deeper search, but I figured you would know more than boring records. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101021 12:00:52 nbsp Hey Richard, I would probably drop that comment on the /talk page to get peoples feedback on it.  Im guessing that there will be some opposition to completely deleting the comments.  What might be a good solution, though would be bumping them over to an archive page with a note saying essentially what youve just said: that theres nothing in your records to indicate the person ever lived there (legally).  If you want to go ahead and make a /talk page there, Ill repeat this suggestion there. Users/TomGarberson

20101021 12:23:21 nbsp Makes sense.  The whole thing has been really strange.  Ill be curious to see whether (s)he actually tries to work it out (in which case I assume most of what happens from here on out will remain confidential) or not. Users/TomGarberson

20101021 13:01:00 nbsp I know you retracted your request, but to make it clear: it isnt my content, and I dont have any special rights to it.  You have just as much right to edit content as I do.  Just like all other community editors have the right to it.  Wiki content is owned and managed by the community.  Ive just been editing a long time and (hopefully) have learned what works well.  Experience is great, and I share what I have seen and what I have learned to try to help find positive outcomes, but it doesnt confer more actual rights to content than somebody who signs up today.   Users/JabberWokky

20101021 13:34:04 nbsp No problem, and it makes sense to discuss stuff like that with other editors.  I just wanted to be clear, as sometimes wiki advice or opinions is mistaken for authority.  Especially when its in the middle of chaos and everybody is trying to find a solution (or just calm things down). Users/JabberWokky

20101028 16:48:20 nbsp Normally silly is liked on the Wiki. There are plenty of serious pages like the Zombie Attack Response Guide but on most pages, humor is accepted. Users/hankim
  Wait, you probably already knew that. Did not read the name you signed with on the comment. Now I feel like a douche. Thanks for making me feel like a douche. Users/hankim

20101028 16:54:46 nbsp No, but youre Users/RickJames a regular on the Wiki, right?  Users/hankim

20101028 19:37:17 nbsp What Han said.  About silliness on the wiki, that is.  Not the other stuff. Users/CovertProfessor

20101030 15:03:12 nbsp Sure, Richard, Id be happy to.  Ill bump the whole thing over to the /talk page first, to see what people think of just deleting (which I tend to think would be OK in this case) versus archiving.  We can figure it out from there, once its off the main Allegre page. Users/TomGarberson

20101030 15:16:47 nbsp Would you mind glancing over the Allegre page and the /talk page to see if I got everything, and managed to avoid pulling anything that wasnt related to renneng? Users/TomGarberson

20101122 09:34:31 nbsp Id just like to once again encourage you guys to use separate accounts.  It could still easily reflect your affiliation with Allegre.  JamesAtAllegre, RichardAtAllegre, and PatAtAllegre, for instance.  It just works better within the Wikis system.  As far as organizational accounts go, you folks are pretty good about identifying the person leaving a comment or response, but if nothing else, itd be a good example to other organizations which are less... scrupulous?  Forthcoming?  Whatever the appropriate term, individual accounts are simply better for the wiki community. Users/TomGarberson

20110216 13:01:02 nbsp Ban discussion started:  Users/Reneng/Ban Users/PeterBoulay

20110216 21:54:42 nbsp I am representing 0910 Allegre apt tenants (my roomates and myself) and I just sent you an email. Please be understood we do have a valid case to leave comments there. The lease we signed was a DAvis modle lease.  I will wait for your response.  Users/Reneng

20130205 15:28:58 nbsp the management at Allegre apt is the best i have had in the four years ive been in Davis. things get fixed when you want and everyone is pretty laid back and kick its or just minds there own business.i would put Allegre apt drew ave davis ca  in the top 10!!!

20130620 14:14:34 nbsp I noticed that you mention a blatant lie on the Allegre Apartment page that you would like to have removed.  The proper procedure is to create a Talk page for the Allegre page by clicking on the Talk icon at the top.  See Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner for further details. Users/CovertProfessor

20130620 16:26:43 nbsp Allegre Staff: Both this account and users/everythingpink are using the same IP addressdue to the changes made by everythingpink I am assuming the same person(s) are using both accts (if Im incorrect please say so). Wiki editors have realized that Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts (accounts not tied to one particular person, but instead to a faceless organization) were causing problems on the wiki, and decided to disallow such accounts.  So, I would ask that you close the Users/AllegreApartments account and reopen one under your name or continue to use only the users/everythingpink account.  To do this, click settings in the upper right hand corner, change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and then press Save.  Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under a new username. For further information please read Welcome to the Wiki. Users/PeteB

20130621 16:02:30 nbsp To Allegre staff: The recent posters Users/SLOWYOUROLL on Almondwood Apartments has the same IP as yourself (98.244.45.179) and Users/EverythingPink. Honestly this is kind of suspicious. If you are setting up accounts to demean other apartment complexes please stop. Wiki users can see where the posts come from and it just makes your staff look very poor if indeed you are doing this. Users/PeteB
