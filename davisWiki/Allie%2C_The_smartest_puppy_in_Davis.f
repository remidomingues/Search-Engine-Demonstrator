Hi, my name is Allie, The Puppy.  People sometimes shorten it to just Allie.  I left my previous owners when I realized I was smarter than them (No joke, they didnt even try to find me).  After I was brought to the http://www.spcamc.org/ SPCA I found this guy named Users/PeterAnselmo Peter & his Girlfriend Megan to go home with.  They knew how to speak dog really well (Megan is a trainer for PetsMart), so now I am much happier.  I am the selfproclaimed smartest puppy in Davis.  Any puppy who wants to challenge that can step up to the plate.  After only a week and a half with my new people, I know my name, come when called, sit, shake, lie down, stay, wave byebye, and will hit a moving target on command.  I also dont chew furniture, and I get along great with the Bianca the coolest guinea pig in town resident guinea pig.  Heck, I can even write a wiki entry for myself.

My owners never met my parents, so they dont know what breed I am.  Most people think Im a combination of Border Collie & Springer Spaniel.  Some people also see Aussie, Jack Russell Terrier, and Beagle in me.  By the fact that I learn quickly, and try to herd other dogs, Id have to agree with the Border/Aussie bit.  But the confusing thing is I was born without a tail.  No, it wasnt cut off, I simply never had one.  I like to wiggle my butt when Im excited instead.  I also like to sit on things.  My favorite things to sit on are the feet of people that visit us.

I like to meet other dogs!  Please have your people call my people and well arrange some playtime.
