Allison serves coffee to bitchy people for employment eight hours a day...after which she serves pizza to more bitchy people in hoping to make the grocery stores grocery money and to pay off the electric bills...she has a man who refuses to be photography photographed, lets just say that he looks like a mountain man and he works at Kinkos.

Allison Corrington does not attend UC Davis school in Davis, but visits regularly to enjoy the sunshine and eat at Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks.
