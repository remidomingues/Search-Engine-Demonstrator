Hi, Im Allison and Im a 3rd year UC Davis student transplanted from UC Santa Cruz. Im a French major and Im really enjoying myself so far.

I like riding my bike around town, hooping at the ARC and out on the Quad on sunny days, and spending time with my guinea pig, Pumpkin Pumpkin.

I am Level 1 and Level 2 certified HoopGirl instructor, and I would love to bring my classes to more areas in Davis! Please let me know if you would be interested in taking classes, or if you know of a place where I can teach classes. I teach at the UCD ARC, but due to low enrollment, my class was canceled this quarter. I will be holding weekly meetings most likely on Wednesday afternoons where you can come and hoop and hang out. Ill be posting more about this soon, either here or my website.  Check out my website at http://www.bloomhoops.com/

Also, if youre interested in learning more about hooping and hoopdance, feel free to email me! allison@bloomhoops.com

Lastly, if youd like to purchase a hoop, you can check out my site for all the colors and styles I can make. I also sell hoops at Whole Earth Festival, so come and say hi!

What is HoopGirl, you ask? HoopGirl was created by Christabel Zamor, and its a kind of dance with hula hoops. Its a very energizing and sassy sort of dance, and its something that Im very passionate about. I discovered hooping Feb. 2007, after taking a class at UCSC with Heather Troy, a certified HoopGirl instructor. Its really fun, and I think its an awesome way for you to connect with you body. If you wanna know more, go to the HoopGirl website; http://www.hoopgirl.com/ .




I can custom make hoops to your size and color preferences. Here are a few that Ive made:
