Haircut: $35 december 2006


20060121 19:34:12 nbsp Jessica, the owner of the salon, does an amazing haircut job!  If you have wavy or curly hair (like me), shell do an incredible job!  In addition to the haircut itself, the way she styled it afterward (which seemed simple enough) was great!  Other places that have done my hair dont really seem to ever get layers right, much less make it look nice when its dry.  I definitely recommend the place!  Its a good investment, especially if you dont get you hair cut much and dont mind splurging on yourself (and who doesnt). Users/AndreaPasiliao

20060303 11:25:12 nbsp I went there about two weeks ago and they did a horrible job. For those who have straight and fine hair, dont go here! they cant cut for shit. They dont know how to layer and they sure as hell dont know how to cut evenly! It is not worth it to pay 30 bucks and come out looking like a complete idiot!! i had to get my hair recut because it was so bad! Users/WalnutNg

20060511 13:25:16 nbsp I have been in before to get my eyebrows done and was satisfied with their service, but I have to say that today I got the worst leg wax of my life. They use cheap wax that didnt pull the hair out instead just broke it. My legs feel just as stubbly as they would if I had shaved about 5 days ago. I was so upset that I asked for a refund. I will not be patronizing their establishment again. Users/HannahReff

20060516 19:33:13 nbsp I used to go tanning here and Ive gotten a facial and eyebrow threading job (which I highly recommend over waxing) here. I love this place :) Its like a girls best friend. I have yet to get a haircut here someday! Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060628 17:13:43 nbsp I went here for a Brazilian wax, after not getting one in almost 2 years.  The lady did a great job and it didnt even hurt that bad.  She was a little more talkative than I would have liked, I mean I dont really feel like talking when youre ripping hair off of me, but she was still a sweetheart and knows what shes doing. Users/HillaryLaFever

20060808 14:33:05 nbsp I called for an appointment and was able to get in the next day. I didnt know specifically what cut I wanted, but I did know what kind of effect I wanted from the cut. I relayed this to Jessica, and she did a great job. She was with me every step of the way and I got a great haircut. The only downside was having her leave me to answer a question a customer had about shampoo, but its understandable because this woman really, really knows her stuff.  Users/HelenDahlberg

20060912 11:21:17 nbsp I went back for another Brazilian and Back Facial and the skinny Persian girl was my attendant this time.  I was a little sad about not having my previous attendant, but this girl also did an outstanding job and customized the facial after asking my more questions than Ive known other salons to ask.  Jessica obviously has a strict policy in who she hires, because everyone who works here is great at their job! Users/HillaryLaFever

20060918 23:12:35 nbsp I got my hair fixed after a different salon didnt do my hair exactly like I wanted. She really knows her stuff, especially with wavy hair, and is very intent and through. The only bummer was that they charged me full even though she just trimmed the back of my hair completely dry in about 15 minutes.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20060923 22:54:19 nbsp I got my back waxed by Jessica. She was so quick and gentle. I didnâ€™t even feel any pain. I have gotten it done from other spas in past but this was the best experience. I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back.   Users/NaveenJaunk

I went to Allure Beauty Salon for the first time and got my hair colored and hi lited.  They did an awesome job, I love the way my hair looks.  I highly recommend them.  Oh yah... I got my eyebrows waxed and it barely hurt and eyebrows have nice arch.  I will go back again soon.

20070213 23:00:51 nbsp I hate this place! they absolutely do not know how to wax eyebrows!!! I have been there before and It was not that great and I thought i would give them another chance....and to my surprise it was even worst than the eyebrow waxing that i had gotten done by jessica. I got it done by some new girl there and she sucks! I am never going back to them again until they can hire people who can actually wax eyebrows! I am so pissed and wished that i never paid them for their crappy job! Users/ChristinaLor

20070402 20:34:24 nbsp I went in today to try the standing tanning booth. I expected to talk to a lady about tanning since ive never been and to my surprise a middle aged man was running the register/main counter! it was a bit weird and he seemed to have some trouble understanding/answering my questions. good thing another worker (a lady) came up to me and was able to answer my questions and give me advice about tanning. I paid $14 for these stupid eye protecting stickers that the guy basically made me buy and for 5 mintues of tanning. the lady told me that for a first time tan no one should tan more than 5mins. they have a flat rate of $12.99 for the stand up tanning booth. the maximum amount of mins. is 12. in the end i felt ripped off, 5 mins of tanning with minimal results. they do have a built in radio in the tanning booth which i thought was cool. overall the people there were friendly.  Users/AmyYang

20070516 04:23:21 nbsp DO NOT recommend. One of the worst hair cuts EVER.  At first I thought this place was a godsend because of the eyebrow threading, but the hairs grow right back within days...so unless you have a special occasion youre better off plucking/waxing.  They use very cheap products...99cents stuff... so dont expect quality when you come here.  I asked for their advertised lash enhacement and I was expecting something new and exciting, only to have the owner Jessica pull out a box of those drugstore fake eyelash singles and try to charge 30 bucks, so I said no thanks! Users/christinegallo

20070625 21:38:21 nbsp Their pedicures are more sanitary than those at other salons because they use a bowl that is sterilized for each person. But at $35 and in a plastic chair, its not worth it.  Users/MandiPeterson

20070707 01:38:29 nbsp Very bad experiences.  Went in for eyebrow waxing and no one could do it even though they were sitting around drinking soda, so I made an apppointment and went back in 2 days later.  They kept me waiting while they sat in the back room chatting and walking out occasionally to see if I was still there.  After 15 minutes of this, I told the receptionist/cashier to let them know that my time was valuable and that I would not be backnot to purchase products, not for services, not for anything.  She just looked at me.  Honestly, I dont know how these business in Davis manage to stay open at all.  Dont bother with this place.  For eyebrow waxing, go to the beauty supply and buy your own for a fraction of the price and for a much more sanitary experience. Users/trma

20070716 15:09:59 nbsp Please do NOT get your eyebrows threaded here. I only get mine threaded and was looking for a place in Davis. I thought it was amazing to find a place so quick, but the lady here ruined my eyebrows. She didnt even get all the hairs around my eyebrows, and thinned my eyebrows SO much. Also didnt care to match my eyebrows so they each looked different. I now drive over an hour to go home to the Bay Area to get my eyebrows done instead of ever returning here. Absolutely terrible and disappointing! Users/CAkita

20070807 17:32:45 nbsp I was in here today to buy some shampoo and was surprised to see that it is totally remodeled, under new ownership and now called Ninas Studio. It looks a lot better and the girls working were really nice and helpful! Users/MPeterson

20071005 15:10:54 nbsp Im sad they closed :( I always had my brows threaded there and Jessica did a wonderful job! If anyone knows anywhere else to have threading done in Davis, please let me know!  Users/Rachelottlinger

20071005 15:24:44 nbsp if you call ninas studio, ask for Marjan, she does excellent threading Users/NinasStudio

20071005 15:28:11 nbsp Oh thank you! Users/Rachelottlinger
