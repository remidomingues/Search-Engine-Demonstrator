  This wall echoes the shape of the old North Channel

  reflect the sediment deposition in the floodplain.

I mean, if you are going to make a lowlevel rammed earth wall in a park, right next to similarlyshaped playground equipment, shouldnt you expect and maybe even welcome some youthful public interaction with your Art?

20060120 12:27:30 nbsp Interactability as the Citys like to call it is a consideration that is always taken into the design of my work. Just look at any of the other projects as examples. Ultimately, the risk assessment is left up to the City and generally their decision to not to allow climbing is made based on past experience. Please do not climb on Art work is unfortunately a sad truth that exists in the state of California. I might add, that when it comes to public art this restrictive climate does not exist in many other parts of the country or the word. Users/TroyCorliss
