AllyAnaheim is a thirdyear (??......in theory, but not in practice. In practice, shes a fifthyear) transfer students transfer student at UC Davis. Her major is Uc Davis English Department English, but everchanging, and currently shes checking out Microbiology and International Relations. Shes new to the Davis Wiki wiki, but finds it ohso helpful in checking out Davis! She generally uses it to pick restaurants but has been known to look at People pages like that of Users/RobRoy and Users/CovertProfessor CovertProfessor and quirky pages like Bathrooms. By the way, AllyA is an Alias, and so she finds it strangely appropriate to speak about herself in the thirdperson.

A little history
Ally is from Colorado, but has lived in New Mexico, Hawaii, New Zealand, and California (obviously, but wiki:SouthLakeTahoe South Lake Tahoe as well).  She hasnt been in any one place for longer than six months since she was sixteen, so this whole Davis yearround thing is strange and unfamiliar territory for her.  Also, AllyA grew up in the Restaurants restaurant business, and greatly values Fast, Friendly, Competent service at the businesses she frequents.  When its good she tipping tips well, when its bad she still tipping tips well, but unhappily so. Now, shell be able to remark about the good/bad service to a semicaptive audience, and this thrills her. Can you feel the excitement?

Some things AllyAnaheim is a fan of include:

  The crunchy noise her shoes make when she walks in the snow
  The Snow, Snow Sports Skiing, snowMen
  Mountains, Oceans, and shes learning to appreciate The Flats
  Surfing, SCUBA, Swimming
  Singing while driving, Dancing while drinking The Graduate !SALSA!, and People that can do both, or either, well..or not so well.
  TravelingTravelingTraveling
  Food Good Food, Beer Dark Beer, and Wine Cheap Wine
  Reading....often used to Procrastination procrastinate, Allys notorious downfall
  New Friends, Funny People, Liberals
  Sustainability Green stylelivin......but only to an extent (She also loves to Driving drive)
  Smiling
