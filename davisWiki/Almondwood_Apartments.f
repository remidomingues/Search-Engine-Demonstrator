The speed at which an individual can connect is dependent on many factors including:
  the quality of the wireless adapter;

  the number of users on the system; and
  the intensity of all users combined downloading at a given moment.

Davisville Management Company does not guarantee 24/7 Internet availability and does not make any representations of an end user’s Internet access speed because factors affecting WiFi access speed vary substantially with the conditions described above.

  For older reviews, read the Almondwood Apartments/Archive Archive Page for Comments from 20052008

20090224 20:21:35 nbsp Im thinking of living here next year and am making plans with some friends. But I was wondering if electricity and internet are included in the price for an apartment (3 bed 2 bath townhouse to be exact). Also, any reviews or tips would be appreciated. Thanks.  Users/LanyardLad

Electricity and internet are not included in the rent as of 20082009.

20090224 21:27:51 nbsp I didnt live here (my girlfriend did), but they will hurt you on the security deposit (which is around a full months rent), no matter how clean you make the place (and this place was clean, like there wasnt a single bit of dust or dirt anywhere in the entire place, they moved the fridge, everything). Their deposits are some of the highest in all of Davis, and even if you clean the place A LOT they will still find ways to take at least 1/3rd of it away, but often they dont even clean the place very well when youre moving in. If you have already signed a lease and are stuck moving in to this place (which I STRONGLY advise against) then please, cover thy arse and take a ton of photos when you move in, with the time / date etc. and keep a hold of them for move out so they dont take any more of your $$$. Also, there are definitely partiers about, but most complexes will be like that, but problems do occur if the party spills out of the apartment across the way from yours and onto the relatively small walkway, and if its a warm spring day and you cant shut your window or have to face high AC costs, then it can be a bad situation. You do have to pay for your own electricity / gas (so hot water and Heating / AC), and definitely internet (but you have to pay for that in most places that arent The Colleges at La Rue The Colleges or on campus housing, my advice would be to grab a 69 month combo package from comcast. Also, fyi, there are several students employed by the complex as some type of assistant, and while I believe some of the positive reviews are genuine, they could also be from the plants. Several of my friends had pest problems and unclean apartments when they moved in, and then still had significant sums docked when they departed, even though they left the place in better shape than they found it. If you are renting a townhouse (twostory) then expect high electricity costs from heating it up in the winter and cooling down in the summer.

Please dont let this be your first apartment experience, unless you want you want a bad one.

But, you will never have troubles finding uncovered parking, the pool and hot tub are quite nice, if you get in there before it closes no ones going to kick you out, its right next to The Marketplace so you can always get to Safeway or a variety of other places for cheap(er) food, and the G/J lines are kinda amazing. But, you can get all this and more at a place that wont screw you over if you look a little harder. Personally, though I know they have higher rents, and lets not even get into their politics, Tandem Properties will generally be upfront and honest with you, and their deposit and rental policies are quite fair.

Again, I didnt live there, but I did spend a big chunk of time over there and remember the issues my s.o. had to go through when leaving. In the end the roommates didnt fight the deposit because it would have taken too much effort, but basically JUST DONT DO IT.

Ill be following this page if anyone else has any questions.
Users/MaxMikalonis M.
PS: Also, if you look @ Nicole Huffs http://daviswiki.org/Users/NicoleHuff?actionuserinfo User Info then it looks like shes acting as if she lives in both Almondwood and Fountain Circle, which if you notice that they both are managed by Davisville Management Company raises the shadiness factor up another notch. I mean, Nicole cant be renting at both places and comment in the first person on the same day, so one of them must be a lie, or shes employed by the company (which would explain her dazzling opinion on the management in both complexes from Fountain Circle: I dont understand why everyone says that Laura is such a bitch and all that, she is always pleasant to me when I go in the office. Ive never had any problems with her. —NicoleHuff).

20090304 11:33:33 nbsp This is in reply to the entry made by M. about my posts.

I am employed by Almondwood Apartments, which is managed by Davisville Management Company. My primary working location is at Almondwood, but in the year I have worked here I have filled in at Fountain Circle, maybe 610 days.  As and office assistant I do interact with Laura, and she is pleasant. I also have witnessed her interact with tenants and have never seen her doing anything she is accused of.   Most of my interactions with Laura are in a nonwork related scenario.  I was planning on leasing at Fountain Circle before I finally settled at Almondwood and remember speaking to her numerous times and she was pleasant.  In my other post I never claimed to live at Fountain Circle, I was merely commenting on my experiences interacting with the management, but perhaps I did not make it clear the context of these encounters, that of a coworker and prospective tenant.
 Users/NicoleHuff

20090320 14:34:25 nbsp In my most recent conversation with the manager, Julia, she was spectacularly rude. She yelled and implied that I was an idiot. She then referred me to her manager, who repeatedly interrupted me, and yelled Whats your problem? into the phone. All because I wanted to clarify something about my lease.  Users/anywherebuthere

20090513 13:24:33 nbsp Dont live here, the manager, Julia, is a huge bitch. Ive been here almost a year and the last time I ever saw her was when I signed the lease. She never told us about closing the pool and hot tub for 2 months in the winter. They entered our apartment to cut a small bush that was growing in our patio unit unannounced. Now that there are horrible weeds growing, they dont care. They are closing the pool AGAIN to do more repairs that obviously couldnt be finished in 2 months. The email on her business card was wrong, and never supplied us with a correct one. Ive heard numerous times of Julia being rude to other tenants. I hate this place, Im so upset I moved here, Im paying way to much for no service. Dont move here. Users/Jess510

20090629 00:12:12 nbsp {{{^}}} No idea what the above poster is talking about.  Julia is extremely nice and polite, and my whole apartment can attest to that.  Ive lived at Almondwood for two years and loved it; the area is nice, repairs are prompt, and the manager is very nice and helpful.  Highly recommended, dont let some of the unusually negative comments throw you off.

The security deposit thing, however, is indeed true (quite high). Users/Col

20090717 09:47:12 nbsp Im not sure what Jess510 is talking about, Julia has always been very kind, courteous and professional  by far the best apartment manager Ive ever had in Davis. The place is pretty nice. Its a little older, but the one bedroom apt is spacious with a walk in closet. The only real cons are the old sinks and counters  especially in the bathroom  think 1980s fixtures. Otherwise Ive really liked living here. The walls are thin and its easy to hear the upstairs neighbor walk from room to room, but overall, Ive been quite happy. Im not an owner or manager and as you can see from my profile, Ive been quite critical of other apartment complexes in the past. Hope this helps. Users/DaveCar

20090810 14:29:25 nbsp Unfortunately the sauna no longer exists.  The last three managers have no idea exactly when it broke, but it has been useless for ages!  Im sorry about that, but I updated the page to show this :).  The apartment complex really is a good one, I lived there for 4 years and still work for Julia during Turnover.  They try their best to find the best vendors so every cent of the security deposit that can be returned will be returned.     Users/CarissaBrehm

20090825 19:31:49 nbsp I have been living in a 3 bedroom townhouse for a year in Almondwood, and will be moving out on Sept 1st, 09. It has been fairly good. the manager julia is a bit quirky and humors. (seems like shes clueless at times) But shes been helpful for any problems weve had. Both her and the maintenance has been real good to us. Anytime we had issues from something leaking or something breaking, she filed a work order and someone showed up to fix it within a day or so. (I think the guys name is Gary, hes been quite polite.) And in regards to electrical costs, its expensive. You dont need to pay for water or trash, but you do pay PGE for electricity. It looks like the AC, Heater, and Water Heater are all electric, so its a pretty high bill if you dont try to conserve as much as you need too! And the security deposit is pretty darn high. ($1500 for our 3 Bedroom Town House). From what the office told me, if there isnt any major damages to the apartment, they will just charge for cleaning. This will cost about $150 on average. So yes its a lot, but if you clean up everything they shouldnt charge anymore. And as someone suggested best thing to do is take photos of everything on a digital camera and just save it to a CD or DVD right when you move in during the inspection. When you move out if they do have any issues with anything, you can show them the pictures with the timestamp. That should solve those issues! Overall fairly good experience. I had some loud neighbors in the same building that were quite loud at night, sometimes annoying. But location rocks, near marketplace, and J+G bus line. Cant beat that. Plus you can bike to campus in about 10 mins on average. So overall good. I havent lived anywhere else, so dont know if something else can be better! :) Users/dennis54

20100930 19:50:38 nbsp dont even bother cleaning the apt when you plan to move out. i myself, am an extremely meticulous and thrifty person, so i cleaned the apt and practically made it new. the security deposit came back. i received 45% of my original deposit. ridiculous.

otherwise the apts are located in a very convenient location. only a few steps away from the bus stops on alvarado, and right across the street from savemart or safeway(in opposite directions).

this place is aight. that is all. Users/mushroomdreamer

20101001 19:07:09 nbsp lived here for two years. moved to a new place because we are down sizing (Thank God we did). This place has been alright, but can always improve. Maintenance is fairly fast and the maintenance guy is really nice. We often kept to ourselves. this is a place for college students  so expect partying and drinking every now and then. expect the hot tub to be busy (even at night past ten). The only thing i was a bit upset with is that once we were soon going to leave, they decided to come and upgrade our apartment. For instance, they put a new floor, new carpet, new tub... ya, the whole thing because we were moving. they commented that our apartment was an older model. everyone else had a new model already. geez, I was all paying the same rate as everyone else with a two bedroom, but i was stuck with an older model when they could have replaced it a while back. Oh well, thats how this place roll. Anyways, regarding the super high security deposit  yes, expect to lose about 400  500 dollars in cleaning!!!! Therefore, my biggest tip, dont clean. Just move all your stuff out, but dont bother cleaning because it is coming out of your deposit anyways. Other than that, bus stop and stores are just a walk over. Not bad at all. However, this place could have afford to put in a washer and dryer in every apartment since they charge such a high increasing rate every year.... but they probably wont do this. Oh, expect the laundry area to be super pack on Sundays and Saturdays. one of the few things i enjoyed was the long pool. it was nice. :) happy apartment shopping  Users/ChiYang

20101002 14:26:27 nbsp I lived here for a year with a couple of roommates.  The place was a little dingy, but most things operated.  Maintenance guy is very nice; sometimes fixes things in a mickey mouse sort of fashion.  I thoroughly cleaned before leaving, including paint touch ups the whole works, and still was charged for a medium clean. Deposits are HUGE and expect to get less than half back if your carpet has to be cleaned.  When moving in, be extremely meticulous about what is broken/damaged/missing; one of our screens was never replaced and the person doing check in had to bed told to write that it was bent.  Overall a good experience, but I would probably not live here again due to high deposits and high cleaning costs. Users/StaceyHorn

20101127 18:26:29 nbsp Nice apartments, nice maintenance staff, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. The manager, Julia, refused to give me a copy of my lease when I lived here until I quoted the section of California Civil Code she was violating by refusing. She is very nice as long as you dont try to stand up for your rights, but God help you if you demand that they hold up their end of the deal legally. She tried to give me a copy of the next years lease instead of my current lease, and insisted I was not allowed to have a dog, despite the fact that my lease included a pet agreement stating that pets were allowed (no restrictions on type of pet were mentioned either in writing or when I talked to the manager at movein). She said that the next years lease stated that dogs were not allowed and that, on that basis, she would evict me if I got a dog (despite an existing pet agreement and pet deposit paid  and never returned  for a pet that had moved out).

I asked to speak to her supervisor. When I called, the supervisor ridiculed me and yelled at me, using phrases like Whats your problem? I just dont understand whats wrong with you. I was calm and polite, and had to ask her several times not to raise her voice at me. I made clear that I simply wanted to express my concern at Julias refusal to give me a copy of my lease, and her insistence on requiring adherence to a future lease rather than my current lease.

The other manager (I think her name was Nicole  perhaps this was the NicoleHuff mentioned below) advised me to illegally evict a roommate who was caught stealing from other roommates by intentionally damaging the front door lock, so it would need to be replaced, and not giving this tenant a key. They advised that we do this only after removing all of her belongings and placing them on the sidewalk outside the apartment. Need I mention that this is completely illegal? I later found out from the police that, had I followed her advice, I would have been subject to some pretty major fines.

Overall, I found the management to be rude and illinformed.

That being said, the apartment was large and in good condition, and the maintenance staff were friendly and prompt. Of course, for $2,800/month for a 4bedroom townhouse, they had better be.  Users/MeganCleary


20101204 11:44:49 nbsp The holiday season is really great at Almondwood Apartments.  The manager just hosted a nice dinner for all the tenants and everyone had a great time.  The food was delicious (and they even gave away prizes!).    Users/Donkey

20101211 11:57:20 nbsp These apartments are wonderful. Clean and spacious, Ive lived here for several years now and the management is fantastic. Any time I had something broken in the apartment it got fixed promptly and the maintenance man is really nice. Julia (the manager) is super sweet and I have never had any problems. I wish I could live here longer but Im moving away soon now that Im almost graduated and I wanted to leave my mark! I loved my time here but its time for more people to enjoy it ). Users/kburnett

20101227 12:02:03 nbsp Just when I thought Almondwood Apartment Management and their parent company Davisville Management couldn’t be any less caring about their tenets, they took it up a notch!  I spent five hours on December 26th with the elderly sister of my even more elderly 76 year old neighbor in my apartment and the police and coroner going in and out during that time because my neighbor, Vivian, had been found dead.  Of course, my neighbor’s death was terrible, but Almondwood and Davisville’s mismanagement of the situation surpassed the litany of previous mismanagement on their part.

When my neighbor’s sister called the Almondwood emergency number, and let’s be clear that I asked her twice if she was sure she called the emergency number, she got a voicemail to which she left a message about the concern of her sister and the voicemail was not returned.  When she called same said number and actually got the on call person, she was told that the on call person had been out of town which is why she did not get a return call.  She was then told that her concern about not being able to contact her 76 year old sister did not constitute an emergency!!!

When I called Janna of Davisville Management this morning for an explanation of how a situation like this would not constitute an emergency I was, as usual, blown off.  When I was beside myself and stated that as a result of their inaction, Vivian lay there for probably two days, to which was replied that we don’t know that for sure.  Perhaps Janna doesn’t, but I got the blow by blow play yesterday, as I took the police to the mailboxes to see how much mail had accumulated, as Vivian’s sister told the police and coroner that Vivian had not shown up for her hair appointment and she had not been able to reach her on the phone for several days to confirm Christmas dinner together.  But as Janna stated to me “You are not on the coroners list as a person of authority.”  She is right, I am just the person who lived next to Vivian for 12+ years, who was like a little grandma to me and who I cared for deeply.
 Users/dancer

20110213 12:21:30 nbsp IN REPLY TO THE ABOVE COMMENT FROM DANCER:
	This is the emergency maintenance employee and I wish to address the comments listed above by username dancer. This event was tragic and heartbreaking. I have lived her for three years so of course I knew the tenant that passed and she was one of the sweetest little old ladies I’ve ever met. She would always wave to me when we passed in the parking lot. To read this comment above was a great shock to all involved because it couldn’t be any farther from the truth. Whether misinformed or simply angry, the comment above was designed to cast an even more negative light on an already tragic event.
The sister of tenant has been very gracious and has thrown no blame to management whatsoever. So this comment from dancer was quite surprising. The comment above states that we deliberately did not respond to the calls and messages left by the sister saying it was “not an emergency”, this is completely false. The sister had called the front office on a Friday night after closing and left a message saying that her sister had missed a hair appointment that day and that she would like someone to contact her. The outgoing message in the office states that if you have a maintenance emergency to call the maintenance emergency number. The sister did this a day and half later on Sunday. The first call I received from the sister on the emergency maintenance line was addressed immediately. The police were called straightaway. It was a very emotional and saddening event for all of us who knew the tenant. For the above comment to claim we do not care for our tenants is hurtful and incorrect in the extreme.
 Users/klmarkee

20110216 16:31:49 nbsp In reply to the reply on my post.  There was another neighbor there the first time that Vivians sister called the emergency number, not the apartments office number.  Also, when Vivians sister came on the 26th and had called ahead of time to tell the emergency contact person she was coming.  When she arrived and knocked on the door she was told she would have to wait til the contact person got dressed.  And in the five hours that I spent with Vivians sister, the police and coronor, I did not once see any of the concerned Almondwood management come by to assist in any manner.

So now it seems that we are playing tit for tat at the apartments.  I received a notice from the manager yesterday because I had left a bag of garbage just outside my door yesterday morning before I ran off to work and had the note on my door quoting on of the Almondwood rules of not leaving debris on porches and balconies that night when I go home.  Granted, I did leave it out and it is a bad habit, but my norm is to throw it in the trash when I get home in the eve.  I would not be so peaved about this because I did in fact break the rules.  However, the managements enforcement of the rules is, to say the least, spotty!  For example, I told the manager at the end of summer or beginning of fall about my upstairs neighbor leaving an old fishtank full of gross algae filled water on their balcony, but that still sits there and with the rain has overflowed onto my porch area just below and she has done nothing about it.

Another example is the parking problem that I told her about in either Sept or Oct and explain that much of the covered parking was being taken by nonresidents.  I was told she would put out a notice and as far as I could see, no notice went out.  So when I talked to her again about the parking just recently and told her I saw someone riding in with their bike to put into their truck to leave, so quite obviously he was using our covered parking to park in while he was at school.  Now the problem has gotten even worse since we talked the second time.

At one point I could find no covered parking and parked in a spot designated for motorcycle parking (that has gone unused for two years now and this was right after I put up my first comment here.)  Of course there was a note that said You are in a no parking zone!  Please move your car or it will be towed!  First of all it was a parking spot not a no parking zone and had the management taken care of the problem when I first asked them to, three months previously I would not have taken the spot. So for the next week I went out the  parking lot to take a tally on how many cars were parked in the covered parking without resident stickers.  On 1/8 @ 11:45 am 37 cars w/o resident stickers, one of which was in the managers spot; 1/9 @ 8:30 am 40 w/o resident stickers one from LaSalle; 1/11 @ 10pm 38 w/o resident stickers 3 from LaSalle; 1/12 @ 7:30pm 36 w/o resident stickers 5 from LaSalle, 1/13 @ 6:30pm 33 w/o resident stickers 3 from LaSalle.  I want to emphasize that I only took a count of the covered parking and not the rest of the lot that was filled with more nonresident cars! Also, someone from the LaSalle side of our complex had left notes on three the LaSalle cars stating the management had been notified.  But of course two of the cars were still sitting there the next day and one the day after that.

Then there was about 6 years of myself and another neighbor fighting with management about closing the pool area at the time the rules stated so that the folks who actually work for a living dont have to go out and tell people to get out of the pool area in the wee hours of the morning. (They have been doing this on a regular basis now.)  And frankly I could go on, but I wont.  Although, the typical reaction of management, as seen by the reply to my first post, is to attack the complainers and not solve the problems.  I fully expect more retaliation as a result of this post.

Now Almondwood is giving out free coffee in the mornings and having barbeques at night to attract new residents in.  It would be really great if they would put their efforts into solving the problems the current residents have and not rip off the out going residents for cleaning fees. Users/dancer

20110906 15:04:54 nbsp The security deposit at this apartment complex is high for Davis ($1000).  I lived by myself in a 1bedroom at Almondwood and wanted to get back 100% of my security deposit, if possible, although this hasnt been my experience fir renting apartments in Davis.  The manger, Julia, was very friendly and did a prewalk through with me to point out things that I would get dinged on if I didnt clean this was as detail oriented as taking off the globes around the lights and cleaning out dirt, as well as cleaning the plastic seal in the inside of your fridge.  It was a LOT of work, but the management worked with me and made it possible to get back ALL of my deposit!

If you are willing to put in some work, and will take the time to do a prewalk through, theres a good chance you can get back most if not all of the high deposit.  Also, keep in mind that youre going to half to jump through the same hoops for most apartment complexes in Davis; at least the manager here was willing to work with me.   Users/cep

20120122 12:38:00 nbsp My friends and I lived in a 3 bedroom flat here for 2 years. Thank god we decided to live somewhere new (not saying where, but there are better places out there...), because I absolutely love my new place. Almondwood was my first experience living in an apartment, so I didnt know what to expect. Well, I can tell you that we spent more money living here than we shouldve.

So after the first year, the managers usually give you incentive to stay another year or two by discounting your rent. However, they still raised our rent. The discount was that it wasnt raised to the amount others would have to pay if they were firsttimers at Almondwood. At my current apartment, the landlord offered to let us keep our already low rental rate, and NOT charge us more.

The deposit is pretty high, and they intend to take a lot of it from you. My housemates and my Dad and I spent hours cleaning that place before moving out, and they still took a lot of our deposit. My dad cleaned the patio spotless, and they still charged us for it. The walls in our apartment were fine, but they charged us $300 for paint. They charged us $170 for cleaning. My dad is a property manager, and he says they charged us unjustly.

I emailed the manager our concerns. It took a couple of weeks for her to forward my message to the main office, and then the main office never got back to me:
Julia from Almondwood Apts. forwarded you inquiry to me at our downtown office.  I apologize if there has been a delay in responding, but unfortunately your last email did not make it here!  I will be happy to pull your file and look into this matter right away.  I will be getting back to you shortly.
Thank you for your patience.

We are a little confused by your post that states you are still waiting for a response to your email.  Janna really attempts to make sure residents are happy and satisfied. Janna is still out on medical leave but I will have her forward the reply emails back to you when she returns. I will do my best to reply to you so you dont feel overlooked.



After your email made it to her, Janna did respond and she gave me hard copies of emails between you and her including the following:

Hello again Ashley,

I have had a chance to review your file and find that the charges seem to be in accordance with what was noted at the moveout walk through. The cleaning that needed to be done to bring the unit back to the same level of cleanliness as it was when you moved in was only the Light Cleaning level. If any cleaning is needed, a level of Light, Medium, or Heavy is assessed by the inspector and approved by the cleaning vender. The cleaning that was needed in unit #29 were, in part, the windows, the window tracks, the range, the refrigerator, the light fixtures, mirrors, bathtub, shower surround, to name a few items. We were able to get it passed as a Light Clean because it was not filthy, but did require work in each part of the unit.

The painting was also needed in each part of the room on a Partial basis (both flat and semigloss), and that cost both labor and material, we do split with you due to the length of your occupancy.

The receipts sent to you were copies of those provided by the venders. If you have any further questions or need more information, please feel free to give me a call or write back to me. Thank you.

 ~Janna

Thanks Janna!



We offer all of our residents an opportunity for a prewalk through to help assess the level of cleanliness, this is especially helpful with several residents in a big unit. We also provide a detailed checklist to assist in the process and to serve as a roadmap to a full refund. As a property manager and business owner, your fathers set of standards may be different than we utilize here at Almondwood when we prepare a unit for our residents. The customary approach is that apartments should be returned with the same level of cleanliness that had at the beginning of the lease. The amount of work necessary to prepare a unit is driven by the standards we follow to provide the apartment to the next resident just like the ones that applied at the beginning of your lease. If you would like to come in and discuss this again, we would be happy to meet with you. We would sure like to move forward on a positive note. Thank you.

20120925 19:51:39 nbsp Almondwood is actually pretty decent, which is saying a lot for an apartment complex. They actually maintain your apartment as their stuff breaks instead of waiting until the end of the lease to charge you an arm and a leg for it (some things my room mate broke which was no fault of their own, and they repaired for no cost anyway) We were only charged 400 dollars on moving out, for the standard ridiculous cleaning rate, carpet cleaning, repainting what doesnt really need to be repainted, etc. Thats to be expected from any apartment complex. The only gripe I had was that they charged us for the screens that were already warped when we moved in, but whatever.

Overall Id give them an 8/10, solid place to live, especially after my traumatic experience at Tanglewood. Users/sundeimasu

20130104 17:23:01 nbsp I lived here 1011 in a 2br/1.5ba, and I didnt enjoy my stay. The carpets are very old (I heard they were from the 80s?). I also thought the office hours were ridiculous, if ever kept. I had seen many a FedEx deliverer waiting outside their office, and I myself had waited an hour during their listed office hours for them. On another occasion, I saw someone else waiting in front of the office when I got back from class and again when I left for class an hour later.

Its a great location (next to Safeway and Petco and Savemart), and I did like that the kitchen had a shelf which seemed like it couldve been really useful). I heard that the year after I was there, they also increased laundry prices. They also have a small workout room and study room, but the study rooms close at 10 (which for some students, especially during finals, isnt that useful) and was rather dark for a study room.

For me, the cons outweighed the pros so I didnt enjoy living here, but I have a friend, who doesnt have packages delivered or have to deal with management (i.e., he goes home every weekend) and he seems to not mind it there at all. I generally recommend against living here. Users/HannahToru

20130607 14:51:05 nbsp I have lived at Almondwood Apartments for almost four years now. I must say I do not care much for the new Manager Hilary. She closes the office early before 5:00PM before the closing time and she is not  friendly .  She really has a way of talking down to people. I really liked the old manager Julia and Gary. It just does not feel like the same Almondwood anymore. Users/jjmonroe

20130613 11:56:37 nbsp MY GOD ARE THEY EVER IN THE OFFICE?! Sooooooo annoying. Users/Machbee

20130614 14:24:43 nbsp We know that it is often difficult when there is a change in management personnel (especially when Julia was with us for nine years and Gary, five years), but we have confidence that Hilary is trying her best as an experienced manager to perform her job with friendliness and diplomacy.  Hilary is required to occasionally leave the office for brief periods to come to the main office, to go to the bank, or she may lock the office to walk the property or meet with someone.  We have also had her going to our other properties for training.  We apologize if this may have caused you an inconvenience.  We should be back to our posted scheduled hours within the next week or so.  If you do come to the office and find it not open, you are always welcome to call me at Davisville (5307585800) and I will always be happy to assist you.
We value our residents and sincerely want the opportunity to resolve any issues any of our residents may have with management.  We pride ourselves in maintaining staff that is caring and responsive to our residents’ needs and we won’t settle for anything less.  We respectfully request the opportunity to meet and discuss any issue that is bothering you.  We hope you give us the chance to meet or exceed the high standards you are used to. We were not able to find your contact information on our roster but we do believe your comments were based upon your true feelings. Please call Hilary and let her know who you are so she can buy you a latte at Pete’s and restart on a positive note and give you the individual attention you deserve.  Thank you.

20130621 14:54:39 nbsp I am not one to write online reviews, but I signed up for a Daviswiki account just to do so.  Here is goes:

First and foremost, I am a resident at Almondwood Apartments, and have been for only the last year.  To say the least, I am MORE than disappointed in the management choices Janna has decided to implement on the complex.  Julia was a fantastic manager.  She was friendly, she smiled every time I came in, and it generally felt like she cared about her residents.  I was sad when she left, but was pleasantly surprised with the younger manager they chose to replace her with.  Although I dont remember her name (she was there for such a short time), she was always smiling, loved to spark up a conversation and was just generally down to earth.  I was surprised when they replaced her with the cakefaced blonde that is now in the office.

Leave it to Almondwood to ruin a good thing.

Lets just say I am NOT impressed with Hilary, nor the way shes been running the show.  She has a cold demeanor to her  whenever I stop by the office (thats if shes ACTUALLY there), I feel unwelcomed  almost as though I am a nuisance to her.  It doesnt look like any of the staff is happy  especially the maintenance man, who has to deal with both Janna and Hilary.  Every time he comes over for a work order, he looks stressed, unhappy and rushed.  One time I recalled him getting multiple phone calls in the middle of him installing a new fixture in my apartment for what seemed like other jobs he needed to do.  It was 4:30pm.  It looks like hes definitely getting the buttend of the entire deal.

Here are a few other reasons why this place sucks:
Ive heard that packages are regularly stolen from the LOCKED parcel boxes outside by the mail boxes.
There are crazy older residents who will yell at you from their balcony if youre in the pool or hot tub a minute after 10pm.
Shady stuff happens in the back parking lot by the storage units...strange people loitering, cars showing up at all hours of the night, and NO ONE there to monitor the activity.  I feel uncomfortable sometimes to be alone in my OWN home.
Ive heard from multiple past residents that they will completely and utterly SCREW you with your security deposit...which is ONE MONTHS RENT.

Although I thought I was making a good choice by moving into this seemingly nice complex, I found out quickly that this place is shady and was not what it looks like on paper and online.  If it werent so hard to sublet an overlyexpensive room far from campus, I would have gotten out of here a long time ago...but now Im stuck waiting until summer ends, and when Ill inevitably be screwed out a majority  if not all  of my security deposit.

Just a word of advice to the naive sophomores looking for a place straight out of the dorms (or anyone for that matter!) DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE.  You are MUCH better off getting a house with a bunch of your friends so you dont have to constantly deal with the crap that these people will put you through.

 Users/SLOWYOUROLL

20130628 08:24:20 nbsp Hello Slowyouroll,
I am concerned about the negative things you mentioned that you heard from others, but I can confirm that there have been no reports of anyone stealing from the US Mail box or of creepers in the back since I have been here. If you notice or experience any of these things please let me know ASAP and we can check our camera system footage to see if it was caught on tape. The night manager has not reported seeing any recent activity around the storage area during his walks around the property at night. Please don’t write me off based on secondhand information you heard somewhere about things that may have happened before I was associated with this property.
I understand that the past few months have been a little busy with the interior upgrade projects. We have a maintenance team working on installing new light fixtures and cabinet hardware. In addition, we have had some new countertops going in by a subcontractor who only installs the countertops; we then install the new sinks, faucets and garbage disposals.
I have not noticed any of the maintenance team under stress, but based upon your comments I asked Rafael if he needed additional assistance and he said that he is happy and has plenty of help. The only recent hectic times were related to a few days when new countertops were being installed and he was concerned because he wanted to make sure no one had to go without a kitchen sink overnight. We were having scheduling issues with the contractor and the calls were probably related to the schedule updates he was waiting for. We really appreciate how much Rafael cares about the residents and we have a lot of respect for him and his valuable contributions to our community.
I know it will take a little time to develop the kind of friendships I desire to have with everyone, but my past experience leads me to believe it will be worth the effort. I respectfully request that you let me have the opportunity to prove to you how much I care about the residents here at Almondwood  Apartments. I am planning to throw a resident appreciation BBQ for everyone on the 8th of July. Please come out and start getting to know me and feel free to bring your friends and family.
Thanks and see you at the BBQ! :)  

20131108 12:59:23 nbsp Slowyourroll, I digress.
   Hilary handles her position very professionally. I have never felt belittled when talking with her, unlike the previous manager. Aside from that, Hilary is approachable and understanding. To everyone who wants to move to Almondwood, do it. Dont get discouraged from the comments in June, because you have to take into consideration that when everyone moves out and moves in, the maintenance crew has to fix up the apartments for the new tenants. Of course theyll be super busy.

I have never ran into any problems with my packages, you can always request to have the package left in the office if it makes you feel better. I have never seen suspicious people at night in the parking lot. And most of the cars driving through and the people walking in the parking lot late at night are RESIDENTS of the apartment complex, who are just on their way back from wherever or on their way out.(If it makes you feel any safer, there are police cars that patrol the area on the weekends when parties happen).  I honestly think this apartment is worth the money I pay each month (especially cause its next to Safeway, restaurants, CVS, the bus stops, etc). If you cant take care of your place, then obviously you shouldnt expect your deposit back in full.

The maintenance crew that Almondwood has here is simply the best. Theyre very friendly and fix your apartment very quickly and nicely.
