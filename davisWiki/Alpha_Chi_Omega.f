Alpha Chi Omega, or ΑΧΩ, is a Sororities sorority at UC Davis located at Address(137 C Street).  Although they are a sorority in the sense that they admit only women, they traditionally refer to themselves as a fraternity because their organization predates the term.  One of the few Greek Life Greek houses located downtown, it finds its home on the corner of C Street and 2nd Street behind the Fast and Easy Mart.  The structure is a white Colonial Revival home, a Historic Places City Merit Resource originally built for pioneer Matthew Clancy.

Alpha Chi Omega was founded on October 15, 1885, at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. Professor James Hamilton Howe, Dean of the Music School, invited seven young women from the school to attend a meeting for the purpose of forming a society. The first appearance of the seven founders  Anna Allen, Olive Burnett, Bertha Deniston, Amy DuBois, Nellie Gamble, Bessie Grooms and Estelle Leonard was in Meharry Hall, wearing scarlet and olive green ribbon streamers attached to their dresses.

Alpha Chi Omegas Founders chose Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, because they were forming the first fraternity in the school of music. Since they thought they might also be founding the last such fraternity, Omega seemed appropriate. Kai, meaning and, was added to form the beginning and the end. Kai was soon changed to Chi, a letter of the Greek alphabet.
