 A Christian Sorority 

http://web.mac.com/bfrannyd/alphadeltachi/Welcome.html Alpha Delta Chi (ADX) is the Christian sorority at UC Davis. The Nu Chapter has been in Davis since 1992 and has a current active membership of approximately 15 women.


ADX girls can be found all over Campus in a variety of majors and activities. You will often see ADX girls praying at the Memorial Union: Flagpole flagpole at noon, swing dancing at the Midtown Stomp with College Life, studying at Starbucks, tabling for 1000 Wells Project Davis 1000 Wells, or working out at the ARC.

ADX also partners with Alpha Gamma Omega (AGO) for events such as the Charity Classic flag football tournament, Coins for Change (supporting http://lls.org/hm_lls Leukemia and Lymphoma research) and Refuge, a lowkey worship night held every Wednesday night at 9:45pm at the AGO house (310 Parkway Circle).


ADX also has fabulous formals and semiformals each year, as well as an annual Christmas party with their brother fraternity, Alpha Gamma Omega.

ADX currently does not have a house but meets weekly at the Davis Chinese Christian Church on Anderson Road, behind Rite Aid.

ADX will have Rush again Spring Quarter, 2010. Check out our http://www.alphadeltachi.net website and http://adxnu.blogspot.com/ blog for pictures, updates, and information about events!
