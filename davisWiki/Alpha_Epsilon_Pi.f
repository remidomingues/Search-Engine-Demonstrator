The UC Davis chapter of AEPi had a cumulative GPA of 3.2 (number 1 for all fraternities), 76 active brothers (number 1 for all fraternities), placed first in Arrowjam and raised over $7,000 for Shaare Zedek childrens hospital. Somehow we still found time to throw the sickest parties... and this was just last year.



Alpha Epsilon Pi or ΑΕΠ was founded at New York University in 1913 and remains the largest social fraternity in California and New York and the largest Jewish fraternity in the world. Ever since our foundation, we have been dedicated to developing college men who portray our ideals in leadership, honesty, loyalty, and brotherhood. AEPi is the only remaining Jewish fraternity in the United States.

At UC Davis, ΑΕΠ has become the largest force in the Greek system. With over 70 active brothers, the most on campus, ΑΕΠ has an extremely extensive and creative social calendar with events every week and a professional house chef who cooks homestyle meals. We go on weekend retreats and overnight formals as well as summer trips to Israel and across the country. We have the strongest fraternal alumni network and a large fraternity house downtown located across from Toomey Field.

Not only does ΑΕΠ host topnotch themed parties, we also hold philanthropy events every quarter to raise money for Shaare Zedek Childrens Medical Hospital located in Jerusalem, which provides aid for children on both sides of the middle east conflict. This past 2010 school year ΑΕΠ is proud to announce that we raised $7000 for the hospital with our events Dumps for Dollars and Mediterranean Night.

ΑΕΠ competes in nearly every intramural sport, including flag football, soccer, basketball and innertube water polo. ΑΕΠ also hosts pickup basketball every Saturday afternoon at our basketball court in our backyard.

This past school year ΑΕΠ placed first out of all fraternities with a 3.2 cumulative GPA.

ΑΕΠ is active on campus, in the Greek system, and in the Jewish community.

We have brothers involved in practically every aspect of campus life. There are currently 10 AEPi brothers currently working at the campus coffee house (coho). Other brothers currently work for student leadership, the interfraternal greek council (IFC), The California Aggie, the ARC, Hillel house, and many other on campus jobs. We have brothers on the Davis Cycling Team, the Frisbee team, and the Taekwondo team.

AEPi is proud to say that we are one of the loudest Jewish voices on campus. We often host talks on Israel at our house and our brothers proudly walk every year on campus at the Walk to Remember holocaust walk. We work closely with Hillel and many brothers work there as interns, Shabbat service leaders, or Kosher cooks.

Not only does AEPi hold our own philanthropies, we contribute and participate in other Greek philanthropic events. From Alpha Phis King of Hearts to DG dodgeball, we participate and contribute money to help support fellow greeks. AEPi prides itself in maintaining good relationships with other greek organizations and often holds events with such organizations. This past spring we participated in The Clothesline Project with Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Psi Epsilon to raise awareness of sexual assault on college campuses.

This past winter AEPi participated in Pi Beta Phis philanthropy dance competition called Arrowjam. We worked hard practicing for months and finally took home 1st place! Check out our performance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?vgjyUB0sHWYc

In 2009 AEPi hosted Iration (http://www.youtube.com/watch?vfTK1YbRHL2I&featurerelated), and plan to host many more concerts in 2010 and 2011.

AEPi has many notable alumni ranging from the creator of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to the former president of CocaCola, to the musicians Simon and Garfunkel, to two Nobel prize winners in medicine. Other notable alumni include Wolf Blitzer, Jerry Lewis, Gene Wilder, and Richard Lewis.

No one could tell me where my soul might be; I searched for God, but He eluded me; I sought my brother out and found all three.
