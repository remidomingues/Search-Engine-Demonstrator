 Activities 
  We as brothers of AGO pray at noon everyday.
  We have our annual AllAGO Pismo Flag Football Tournament every October, hosted by the Kappa Chapter, as well as our own Winter Football classic here in Davis,
 where all teams compete for a huge, awesome trophy and all proceeds go to the Invisible Children Foundation.
  We have awesome exchanges with the spectacular Panhellenic Sororities of UC Davis, as well as many events with our sister sorority Alpha Delta Chi.
  We have a 10 bedroom house on campus, which is cheaper to live in than dorms or apartments. Its also clean on a regular basis. Stop by and check us out!
  We host Mens Bible Study(which is open to nonGreeks as well) Wednesdays at 8:30pm and hold worship (Refuge) after at 10:00pm
  We are a Brotherhood that stands for Honor, Service, Integrity, Creativity, Truth, Leadership, Competition, Love, and Respect, united under Christ.

No, were not your average fraternity. Though we do know how to parties party (believe me, weve been doing it for 2000 years) we stand for what we believe and hold strong to our values. We are a group of men who come from many different backgrounds and beliefs, and we respect the beliefs of others. We provide an alternative to the stereotypical fraternity lifestyle, while still having a great time and getting the most out of the college experience. Feel free to stop by and check us out anytime, our door is always open and we would love to get to know you!

It has been my experience living next door to this organization that they were not communicative with their neighbors whether being politely addressed in passing or about issues relating to noise or other community disturbances. I had no idea, however, when I made the comment on this page about dancing, that dancing was actually prohibited. Ironic!  Users/KarlMogel

For a Christcentered fraternity, you would think that they would be friendly, neighborly, open and inviting... but no. I lived right next to them and they are extremely reclusive and downright rude. By the way, women and girls are not interchangeable terms. Users/ArielaHaro

I understand we have that stigma of being reclusive, but not all of us are like that. I know a number of guys living at the coop, Ive stopped by whenever they have parties, I think theyre fun. I think a lot of guys are just shy too, so you cant really blame em for not being open and inviting. Users/MattNewgren

20060912 09:31:38 nbsp NO DANCING??!!!! !!! ??!!! Last time I checked, all of our anscestors have used dance as a ritual to connect with spirit. Dancing is a divine practice that for many of us is the easiest way of praying. Our bodies are sacred. There is no God of love that would condemn dancing! Let us all be free to dance and love and live! Users/YogaGal

20061203 21:57:23 nbsp I think that the men of AGO are awesome. I dont know about the naysayers. The dancing thing is just an old bylaw from the founders way back in the day.  Users/SoCalGal

20090511 00:20:33 nbsp AGO has consistently had the least noise complaints of all the fraternities on campus. Look it up!  users/joexcore

20090615 23:16:09 nbsp AGO seems like a cool group. Just please dont confuse them with the nonfrat college christian groups like DCF, Intervarsity, Campus Crusade, College Life, Koinania, or any of the oncampus christian fellowships. Theres a big difference between AGO and those other christian groups. Users/BryceH
