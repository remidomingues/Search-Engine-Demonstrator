 About Us 
Alpha Sigma Phi was founded at Yale University in 1845 under scholarly principles. We believe that by encouraging our members to take on roles of leadership, campus participation, and brotherhood, we can inspire them to become better men. Not only do we strive to better ourselves and our community, we want to be the fraternity of choice for discerning young men by offering them many different opportunities including leadership development, community service, academic assistance, athletics events, and an amazing social experience. We also take special pride in our brotherhood and the strong bond that brings all of us in Alpha Sigma Phi together.

Were new to campus, but weve been working hard to make our voice heard. Unlike other larger and more rooted fraternities, new brothers can make a difference and be involved in how our fraternity runs. In fact, a fair amount of our officers (including our President) were only pledged in last fall (Fall Quarter 2012).

Our hope is that during this rush week, we will see new faces and meet new individuals who are willing and want to be a part of our brotherhood experience.

 Serenades 
We started as a singing fraternity. Though not all our brothers are musically talented or trained, we have made sure to go out and sing our hearts out to various sororities, serenading them in the process. They love us for it and it is a whole lot of fun!
