AFC was started by former Campus Cinema employee & movie buff Users/JamesHirsh James Hirsh during the Fall of 2002.  After Hirsh graduated in 2003, the club was run by Rob Roy and others in the Pirate Ship.  The club used to meet every Wednesday at 8:30 pm in 2 Wellman where they would show alternative films.  There has been little mention of its activity as of late, but we can always hope the club will pop up again. The http://alternativefilmclub.tripod.com/ Alternative Film Club has exposed many a student to all sorts of cool, entertaining films.

Recently, SPAC has added to its organization application forms questions regarding film viewings: are going to show a film or not? And if you do, what is the purpose? And most importantly: do you have permission to show the film? Have you contacted the people who own the copyright? So, this said, the Alternative Film Club is not likely to be revived.

Film buffs, check out Retro Film Revival.  Sacramentos Crest Theatre also runs a yearly event called http://www.trashfilmorgy.com/ Trash Film Orgy.

As quoted in The California Aggie (10/28/02):

Irene Park: They show interesting movies, not like the kind you see in the theaters. They are just amusing.

Liz Rard: They show a good variety of films, more than just what is considered mainstream. They show stuff not everyone will like. Its good to be offended.

Rachel Maximo: Its a good chance to meet people and make friends. Its a club for the people. You get to see movies you havent seen before for free. So come and watch  you have nothing to lose.

Anneliese Kaufman: Its not formal; you dont have to be a member; you dont have to do anything. Just come and watch the movies.


  Now why dont we have an unofficial Alternative Film Club? The meetings could be held anywhere like an apartments apartment or somebodies suite dorm at the Cuarto Residence Halls or something. Id think that as long as we do it in this form then we could claim its for home and personal use Im only an incoming freshman but Id think there would have to be a way to get around the rules a little bit here. ~Users/NathanielJarrett

20050901 15:25:07 nbsp Well, you can only fit so many people in a cuarto dorm, and the sound and picture will probably suck. What you can do is find out when 2 Wellman is unoccupied, and hold renegade AFC showings in there. However, if someone else has reserved the room or needs to clean it, you get kicked out. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050901 15:33:22 nbsp while I was busy with Moving Day I came across an old flyer for the old AFC with James, from 20022003, I believe. :p I brought my copy of This is Spinal Tap for viewing once, the French subtitles strangely got left on. Users/IrenePark

20050914 14:20:37 nbsp Im just back from spending 5 years in Central Europe and the Balkans and have a ton of foreign films Id love to show.  Im good for the underground approach at that hall.  Shall we set a meeting date and see if we can get a few people to show up to at least talk the idea over? Users/AaronBurda

20050915 13:20:41 nbsp The problem with scheduling renegade meetings is that its hard to know what the schedule of the room is going to be free. Users/ArlenAbraham

DateTime() Paraphrasing a lot of what Users/IrenePark sent me in an email, unless we want to get into a lot of legal stuff about publicly showing a film, contacting copy right owners, etc. we have to make our showings a non public viewing but at the same time push the boundaries of that as far as we possibly can.  We wouldnt be able to do promotion of any event officially but word of mouth would probably more than suffice (as well as the wiki).  In terms of location, since we cant officially ask for permission to use some equipment (that would require copyright permission) wed have to do it with a nod and a wink from either some professor/graduate student who knows the schedule of a room and can tell us when nothing will be going on there for 3 hours.  As long as there is no promotion, no donations/fees, no major problems for the department (including cleaning up) and nothing is official with the clubs organization we may be able to find somebody to help us.  Other than that I think wed have to have a really small club of max 15 people and watch films at somebodies place (not a bad alternative, although somewhat restrictive). Users/AaronBurda
  Im not sure that it would be impossible to get copyright permission from studios, but then, I havent tried yet.  but I mean, what do those Anime clubs do when they show their stuff (assuming thats what they do)? Need to do more research on policies and who holds what copyrights, etc. Users/IrenePark
    Pretty much everything the anime club shows isnt even licensed in the US. Users/JevanGray Jevan
  Good news, I did a little googling and found out how to get public use films for universities.  http://www.swank.com/ is the company that most organizations use.  You can get some legal info at http://www.haverford.edu/av/copyright/pubperform.html  According to swank, almost all major US universities have an account with them.  I searched their film archive and it seems they have a quite diverse selection.  It kind of seemed that it doesnt take long for them to ship you the DVD once you order it (a week max).  There werent any prices online except for The passion of Christ which you can show at your church to less than a thousand people for $75 for one showing.  Hopefully that is fairly representative of the prices.  I sent them an email asking how to get an account, how to find out what the prices are and if UC Davis already has an account.  If this works out then we could definitely do everything official and borrow an auditorium. Users/AaronBurda
    Swank is where the http://resnet.ucdavis.edu/Cable/movies.htm Student Housing Movie Channel gets their flicks. Users/JevanGray Jevan

20050915 22:55:11 nbsp Swank seems a bit extreem for a film club. Maybe what youre looking to do, Aaron, is revive Campus Cinema... Users/ArlenAbraham

  I think we have three option, any of which I would be cool for doing, the first is just going to somebodies apartment and watching a good film, people could take turns picking the film.  The problem of course is finding somebody with a large enough room, decent television and where we wont be disturbed.  Second we could do an underground showing in a free classroom/auditorium.  As discussed this has its downsides but may also be doable.  Third we can actually get the film from Swank and do a legit minor public showing, this would be feasible if we had at least 15 people, everybody paid $5 and presumably getting permission for a room then should be fairly easy.  This assumes the films are only $75 for minor public showings, which I think may not be the case.  Or lastly, we could do option three but just for The passion of Christ and show it over and over again each month..... ;) If Im missing anything....put it up.  Users/AaronBurda

20050917 09:48:56 nbsp What medium does swank give you? Is it a 35mm reel? Id be willing to pay $5 to see something in 35, but i dont (currently) know how to run a projector. That being said, someone at my IET Mediaworks place of work could probably teach me. Users/ArlenAbraham
  I would imagine that it would be DVD but that is just a guess.  We could probably get 35mm but it would be a lot more expensive.  When I think about it, its probably best to start with a minimalist approach (my initial enthusiasm for swank aside) and just get together and watch a few films in somebodies living room.  When we get to the point where its crowded we can look at expanding our little club. Users/AaronBurda

20050920 10:00:38 nbsp Since were starting out small, do we want to set a date/pick a film/pick a location for a first meeting? If we all show up at lecture hall A and theres a class or something, we can always walk to lecture hall B. Also, do we plan on doing any nonwiki/nonwordofmouth advertising? Users/ArlenAbraham
  Hi Arlen, sorry for not replying sooner.  A couple of friends of mine at the Graduate School of Managment have formed a small group that will be showing films using one of the classrooms and projectors.  The School didnt ask anything about copyright issues and it is in a classroom so hopefully that qualifies as a nonpublic showing.  Anyway, we watched one film last night (with popcorn and drinks) and everything seemed to go ok.  About eight people from the GSM showed up and a couple more have expressed interest.  I am going to start posting dates when well be having films on my wiki home page so if anybody is interested just show up (or contact me and Ill give you more info).  The films are picked each week by someone who thinks they have something good to show.  The GSM up to this point has said its fine, although they wanted to think about it so we may get the boot in the future... Users/AaronBurda

20051016 21:19:45 nbsp I came across this jewel and felt I had to share it with you, my Wiki friends.
