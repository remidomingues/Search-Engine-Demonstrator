Alvarado Parkside is a centrallylocated quiet apartment community with affordable apartments and townhouses managed by StarCrossed Properties. All of the comments state that this is a very quiet place to live, since most of the residents are families with children and some very studious academics. Residents have commented that maintenance is quick, with the new management company making lots of small improvements. One cool feature of Alvarado Parkside Apartments is that they have a community vegetable gardens garden. Some residents of singlefamily homes have their own garden plots in their front and back yards, but it is rare to seen vegetable gardens at apartment complexes.

Although technically in North Davis, Alvarado Parkside is conveniently located in the center of town near three major shopping centers, the Greenbelt and lots of parks. If the big trees dont obscure them, this is probably an awesome place to watch the ever popular July 4th Fireworks.

 Internet Access 

The free internet provided by Instaconnect is pretty unreliable. Also, the technical support is not available to address issues as they come up. If you call Instaconnect technical support you can leave a message and they are very good about calling you back a few days later. Unfortunately, this is not useful for fixing problems immediately. The wireless network has poor signal, frequent outages, and is slow. To use a wireless device you must first register it through the property manager. This is fine if you have only one computer, but if you have multiple devices such as phones, gaming systems, and laptops, you must register each individually using the MAC address of that device. On some devices, the MAC address may not be obvious. If your friend comes over and wants to use the wireless network using his/her phone or laptop you would have to register the device first with the property manager. The registration is fast if the manger is home and willing to do it right away, but often she will simply wait until the evening or may not be home. Expect to purchase internet service separately if you live here and want reliable internet. It is obvious from the many networks throughout the complex that many residents chose to set up their own.

20060331 16:37:52 nbsp Ive been living here for 6 months, and I think I can make something of a review.  The current manager, Dianne is very good at her job, friendly and efficient.  Shes easily available and very accomodating.  The owner of the complex does all the maitnence, he is also friendly, and will always get the work done promptly.  Mostly famillies of internationals, it skews more towards families then the other complexes in davis.  The apartments are moderately sized, with sloping cielings in the bedrooms.  They are very well lit, and quite pleasent.  The weakest part of the apratment is the small kitchn and shelving areas. Ive had to get creative with storage, escpecially since I enjoy cooking and cooking gagdetry.  Its Quite, and the tenants are uniformly friendly.  Recomended. Users/CharlesGeorge

20080224 15:15:02 nbsp is there laundry in the apartments or is it a laundry room Users/WeiChun

20080822 22:36:23 nbsp I wished I had found this place earlier. Rent is cheap for this quaint apartment. Neighbors are very nice mostly families as said before. The manager lives at the complex so if anything happens you can easily contact her. The owner is a very kind man as well and helps out a lot. They will fix anything by the next day! The rooms upstairs are the best because of the high ceilings. Bus is easy to take and its only a 10 minute bike ride. Yes there is a laundry room. Laundry is cheap to do here only $1 altogether! And the pool is always so clean! Users/Terry

20090401 15:55:04 nbsp THE GOOD: Ive lived here for almost a year now and I love this place its great. Im actually in the process of renewing my lease. Rent is cheaper than most places (1,090 for two bedroom 1 bathroom). There is a laundry room thats not really crowded, and laundry is cheap! Theres a pool. The F line stops right in front of the apartment complex. Its relatively quiet. Not many students live here this apartment mostly houses families, professors, and graduate students, but Im an undergrad and I love it. No roaches or rats or fleas or anything much. The maintenance is very very helpful, they respond quickly and they are really nice. A lot of trees surround the apartment so the apartment is always naturally warm in the winter time and cool in the summer time. Also the apartment is like 57 minutes away from Savemart.

MODERATE: However if you are the party type this is probably not the apartment complex for you.

THE BAD: There is somewhat of a quiet hours here since many families have kids who need to sleep early, but my roommate listen to music loud all the time and weve never gotten any complaints.

I highly reccomend it :)

20100301 15:25:34 nbsp I lived at Alvarado PS for 4 years.  As has been written before: nice neighbors & nice management & very little noise. No problems after moving out. The town houses have huge storage space available and the kitchen cabinets are plenty there.  They have gardening plots !!!
As it is the rule for Davis apartments, very little is really new or modern there (~30 years old).  I guess this is an aspect one simply has to get used to in Davis.  All in all though these apartments are highly recommended.

(The laundry and dryer machines are in a laundry room  it is accessible even in night time with a key, then) Users/mikelarsen

20110105 22:29:12 nbsp I have been living here since August and really love it. The apartments are big and the management is nice. We recently switched over to StarCrossed management and they seem great. Tonight at 9:30pm I called the apartments to tell them we were having an issue with our toilet and by 10 Hanz and Tom (new complex owner) were at my door. Tom fixed up our problem and was very respectful and friendly. This is a great complex and I highly recommend it!  Users/RitikaSharma

20110506 12:17:40 nbsp Ive been living here for 4 years; its a great place to liveconvenient, quiet, relatively cheap, great neighbors (a lot of families, a lot of contract scientists at UCD), and the apartments have a great floorplan, very livable space.  Above all, management is great.  This is true of the new management, StarCrossed, too.  Theyve been making various little improvements since they bought the place a few months ago.  One of those improvements created a noise problem in my apartment (a waterpump that improved hot water supply to other apartments, but made a very annoying humming sound in my livingroom).  Tom (the property manager) and the onsite managers were fantasticthey responded quickly, were relentless in trying multiple different solutions, and resolved the issue completely within a relatively short time, despite it being a stubborn and expensive problem to fix.  I was seriously impressed both by their actions and their attitude.  These are the people you want managing your livingspace.  All in all: I doubt youre going to find a better place to rent in Davis; grab it if you get the chance. Users/EdwardDickinson

20110601 01:39:32 nbsp Aww, me and my family used to live here a long time ago when I was a weelittle kid. Im so happy to come across the wiki of this place and see the front to our old apartment right there as the main picture! Oh nostalgia... Theres this small little patch of grass that was perfect for playing catch and stuff a little west of that pool. So many memories. Good times, good times... Users/CecilioPadilla
