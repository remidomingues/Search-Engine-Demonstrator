20070713 16:52:57 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Ive noticed that you removed your signature from a few of the comments you contributed. In general it is best to leave the signature attached as the http://daviswiki.org/Woodland?actiondiff&version285&version184 page history will still show who added the comment, but it is less work for other people to have to go back through the page history looking to see who added it. When making changes to the content of an article obviously this suggestion doesnt apply. Users/JasonAller
