Alyssa graduated from UC Davis in 2009, one of the last Medieval Studies majors and a true Roddyite.  She recently abandoned dreams of continuing in academia in favor of more practical pursuitsnamely trying for a law degree.  She enjoys reading, and watching films.  She is what is sometimes known as a movie buff; during her tenure at Davis, far too much of her money from home was spent on movie rentals at 49er Video.  She also watches regular old television, though she admits that it rots ones brain, particularly shows like American Dad and Family Guy, which she is ashamed to admit that she loves.  She has ceased watching House, which she once loved, as it has of late become far more dangerously brainrotting than the other two combined.

As to shows not currently in syndication, she is enamoured of British comedies like Blackadder and Red Dwarf, and she is a consummate Trekkie.

She is ethnically Judaism Jewish.

She often misses living at Pinon Apartments, where she lived whilst a student at Davis.

If youre watching House because Chase is hot, its brainrotting.  But the dialogue approaches Oscar Wilde at times... this jury member votes not brainrotting.   Users/JabberWokky jw
