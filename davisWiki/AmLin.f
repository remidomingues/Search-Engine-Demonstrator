AmLin loves Davis, the town really grew on her in the 7 years she lived there while getting her BS in Nutrition Science and MS in Nutritional Biology. She currenty resides in Woodland (Davis evil twin as someone on Wiki called it...seems a bit harsh) because she could actually afford a house there. For now, shes happy living in Woodland, eating in Davis, and working in Sacramento at the Network for a Healthy California. Her favorite Wiki activity is commenting on FOOD!

Cart bounties are worked out amongst vendors who shag them! People are really constantly sideshowing in woodland?  Users/StevenDaubert

In my previous neighborhood, which was very family oriented and near a large park, yes, every night I could hear street racing, sideshowing, you name it. Since moving to a neighborhood thats still basically a construction zone, I havent seen any of this, but dont yet know if that will be the case at some point. I have no idea what the appeal is of this type of behavior. Users/AmLin
