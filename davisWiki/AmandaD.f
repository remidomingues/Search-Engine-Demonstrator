20110309 08:37:34 nbsp There are several pages that are pretty insensitive in the way they approach topicsTragic Events and Town Characters being prime examples.  One thing to bear in mind, though, is that Davis Wiki doesnt try to be an encyclopedia.  Rather than striving to present things from a neutral point of view, leaving all opinion out of it, it tries to collect many opinions and represent many points of view.  That happens through collaborative editing and, in the case of disagreement, a bit of discussion.  Rewriting the entry, as you did, is the perfect approach.  If others disagree with your edit, they can make the changes they feel appropriate.  If theres a conflict of opinion, usually a brief discussion leads to a compromise that represents both sides.

In other words... thanks for editing!  If youre interested in reading about the point of view issue, theres a lengthy discussion on the Neutral Point of View page. Users/TomGarberson

20110314 02:49:34 nbsp Thanks for the comment. I know that wikidavis isnt an encyclopedia, or trying to be one, but I believe that a neutral point of view is an important thing for an information reference. I also know that that is a lot to ask sometimes. I just hope that articles can maintain a polite and neutral tone, and opinions can be saved for comments. Wishful thinking I guess, lol.
