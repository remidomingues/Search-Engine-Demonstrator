Amaranth is a  Music Scene band that features Pinche Hector (exbackups), Gary (exlist), Javier (exbackups) and Roxy (girl drummer).  I hear them a lot cause they practice in the garage, Users/TheRadish Radish says they sound like Interpol.  I would say they sound like a more punk version of Radiohead, they do some interesting stuff.  Even if you dont like the music, Hector always puts on a good show.

Not to be confused with http://www.myspace.com/amaranthdudes these guys who have been in Hella and are from Nevada City
