 Candidate Statement 

What’s up Aggies!

My name is Amelia Helland, and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the NOW slate. I am a thirdyear Applied Statistics major from Granite Bay, California. Currently, I am the Vice Chair of the External Affairs commission, an intern to the ASUCD President, the treasurer of the Simply Being Meditation and Yoga club, and a part of the Contact Improvisation Dance club.

At the top of the list of reasons to elect me an ASUCD Senator, is the fact that I truly care about the people and the environment of our campus. I LOVE DAVIS! Being a student here has been a great experience so far, but I believe that there is always room for improvement. If elected, here are a few of the ideas I would like to see at UC Davis:

FIND WHAT STUDENTS NEED
We don’t know how accessible ASUCD is to our student body. That is, we don’t know to what extent students use the resources of our Association. I want to work with the Davis Honors Challenge to develop a market research study of student needs, habits, and expectations of our student government and its units. This will provide student leaders a more accurate idea of how we can represent the students here on campus.

STRENGTHEN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS AND ADVOCACY COMMITTEE
This is a new special committee that was created last year to protect the basic, fundamental right of all students to be free from sexual harassment and assault by challenging the dominant paradigms that constitute rape culture. I would like to be the Senator appointed to the committee so that I can work to help ensure that its resources reach students.

I look forward to serving you and the Davis community in the future. Please remember to vote AMELIA HELLAND #1 AND NOW #26 for ASUCD Senate and WONDERS/GHAI for ASUCD President and Vice President on February 1821 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
