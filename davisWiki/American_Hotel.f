American Hotel was a Davisville hotels hotel in existence as early as 1870. In 1872, the hotel was home to the towns first library which operated from one of the rooms upstairs. The library was operated by Mrs. Marden and Mrs. Crawford, two women whose husbands worked in the hotel business.  In 1878, W. H. Marden purchased the hotel, and it became known as the Marden House. It was a twostory building that underwent a few expansions, eventually containing a total of 35 rooms. Before the town had a dedicated plank jail structure, the American Hotel was also used to detain lawbreakers.  The hotel stood about where KetMoRee is now.
