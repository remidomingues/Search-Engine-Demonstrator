Sim City Pizza Planning Party

  Each March the APA hosts the Sim City Pizza Planning Party where we make citys on pizzas a la the sim city computer game.
  First, you build your city.  Put in parks, industrial, commercial, whatever scale and whatever theme you like.
  The computer game has disasters like earthquakes, fires, nuclear meltdowns.
  We have disasters like the oven and the mouth
  Perhaps the most famous disaster of all was at the 2005 party where CRD student Carrie Harvilla built San Francisco on a pizza, baked it in the over (to simulate the great earthquake of 1909) then poured on vodka and lit it to simulate the subsequent fires.
  Get your ideas ready for the 2007 party!
