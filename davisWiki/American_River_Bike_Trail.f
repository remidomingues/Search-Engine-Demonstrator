Temporary Partial Closure  Due to a recent railroad trestle fire on March 15, 2007, a portion of the trail is closed just to the West of Business 80FootNote(http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/139226.html).  There is no planned reopening at this time.

The American River Bike Trail connects Folsom Lake and Old Sacramento and is the site for the annual wiki:sacramento:Eppies_Great_Race Eppies Great Race triathlon. The official name is the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail, and it is part of the coasttocoast American Discovery Trail.  Roughly http://www.saccycle.com/bikewaymaps/map6.htm 33 miles long, it is set away from major metropolitan areas, providing a peaceful and beautiful getaway. The trail officially starts in Discovery Park at mile marker zero, and heads due East to Beals Point (about where mile marker 32 would be). Mile markers appear every halfmile along the trail. The distance between Old Sacramento and mile marker zero is roughly one mile, bringing the total endtoend trip to almost 33 miles. Open to foottraffic and Bicycles cyclists, the trail is also one of the few places in Sacramento to formally allow horses. A 15 MPH speed limit is in effect. Be aware that the offroad trails are not for bikes, even if you have the best mountain bike in the world. You will be cited and possibly fined if caught.  Likewise, citations are commonly issued for walking dogs or riding horses on the paved bike trail, walking dogs off their leash, and not cleaning up after your dog. The trail is maintained by the county of Sacramento.

The trail follows the wiki:sacramento:American_River_Parkway American River Parkway and loops over the American River a number of times, hence its name. Although it used to be a series of disjointed smaller trails, integration of those trails have made the path what it is now. Because the path runs through some secluded areas and is rife with homeless camps, crime along the trail is not uncommon  bring a friend to enjoy the scenery and for safety. Users should be especially aware of the high risk of rape along the trail.

Any person can enjoy the trail  from novices to experts. There are several campgrounds and access points, as well as water fountains, so short trips are as easy to plan as ones that go to Folsom and back.
