Amicis East Coast Pizzeria serves thin delicious pizza and other Italian dishes quickly and with service that matches the quality of the food.


20070711 00:03:03 nbsp I just went, and let me say, I am ... starving. I split a Large NY pizza with someone. The crust and greasiness were welcomely on the ball, and they get mad props for that. But $18.75 was way too much for a 15 cheese pie, and Im still really really hungry. Kind of like buying a California burrito and getting something the size of a Taco Bell 7 layer burrito. East coast pizza is thin, but it makes up its calories in diameter. In NY, your average pie is 18 inches or higher. If you do the math, thats about 1.5 as much dough and 1.5 as much cheese as what I had tonight. Actually, make that 3 times as much cheese there was very little on what I ate. On the positive end, it did taste good (as per personal preference, I added a shake of oregano), they were very quick, and their menu has some interesting varieties. Ill probably return for their Fried Eggplant pizza. Users/CraigBrozinsky

I sometimes get delivery from Amicis to my apartment in Vacaville because theyre prompt and have free delivery. I wouldnt go out of my way to eat here from Davis, but it might be worth a stop if youre in the area to go to the outlets.

Also, make sure you stick to the pizza! We made the mistake of getting pasta one time, and the pasta was mediocre at best and pretty expensive. We were very disappointed. Users/bear
