Sup. I graduated from UCD in 2008 with a double major in Physics and Mathematics. Now Im a graduate student in Physics at UCSB. One day when I have free time I hope to take up maintenance of the Santa Barbara wiki on wikispot. Im also one of the people that maintains the server atop which this site runs.



Amit smells!! :P  Users/NatalieKitchiner

Is there any way you could get pictures of the inside of the Crocker Lab for the Wiki?  I want to see that cyclotron!  Users/MattJurach

Most of the interesting parts are embedded in concrete, but Ill see what I can do. :)  AV

20060821 18:34:19 nbsp you are suck. Users/JessicaYang

20061021 08:25:10 nbsp Purely in the interests of keeping people informed (and for historical reasons down the road), it might be a good idea to do a one paragraph update somewhere (System Info?) on the why and where (SR > SF) of the server move. Users/JabberWokky

20061022 05:59:32 nbsp JW:  Im too tired to really do this justice, but heres a semicoherent rambling summary of what, why, and where:  Cernio Technology Cooperative Cernio is a coop, which means its interests are directly aligned with those of its member/customers.  Weve been ecstatically happy with the customer service at Sonic.net, but we found that we would get better pricing, network connectivity, logistical arrangements, and pricing if we moved from the halfcab in SR to a full cabinet at the 200 Paul datacenter in San Francisco.  This was no small undertaking, and has been in the works since mid2006.  (We finally reached an agreement with the new vendor and started moving equipment in early October 06.)

Weve already seen a 50% reduction in costs, and will likely see even greater efficiency gains in the next 90 days.  Ive been subsidizing the costs of colocating Davis Wiki, and now the actual expenses are closer to (but still a little higher than) the $50/mo that DWiki pays.  Since Davis Wiki gets member pricing (thanks to Philiip), when Cernios costs on Davis Wikis colocation drops below $50/mo Davis Wiki will end up paying that lesser amount.

The server that handles Davis Wiki was one of the last to move, and Amit and I worked within our limited resources to ensure that the negative impact of the move was minimal.  For example, even though we changed DNS records (and had already set a low TTL), we implemented an HTTP proxy from the old IP to the new one to ensure that users of lowquality yet popular ISPs like Comcast and ATT/SBC/Yahoo could still see the site before their DNS caches finally expire.  However, we didnt have a good way to ensure that the site contents stayed up while the server was in the back of Amits Volvo during the drive from SR to SF.  We would have preferred to mirror the site (even readonly) at the new location to smooth this transition, but we found that doing so was going to take at least 4 hours longer than expected.  We have ideas on how to implement that for future events  Amit can explain further.

All in all, it was an important and worthwhile transition, and overall it went very well.  As usual, Amit and Philip were great to work with  thanks, guys! Users/GrahamFreeman

20070301 22:49:34 nbsp I met you once a long time ago.  We established we are both goons.  You probably established that I am an annoying drunk, but I did not figure that out until a couple months ago. Users/BradBenedict

20140813 09:30:15 nbsp Hey Amit, I would like to create a group but my email is already associated with my personal wiki page.  Can I change my personal page to the group page?  I dont need a personal wiki page as I have more than enough social media pages.  Let me know if I can do this.  I am trying to set up a page for Davis residents who like to skin and scuba dive so we can exchange info and share rides to the coast.  Thanks,
Pete Users/PeterFuszard
