The Amnesty International Davis Community Chapter (Group 21) is a community organizations community organization that works in partnership with people from across the world standing up for humanity and human rights. The purpose of Amnesty International is to protect people wherever justice, freedom, truth and dignity are denied. We investigate and expose abuses, educate and mobilize the public, and help transform societies to create a safer, more just world.

The Davis Community Chapter meets regularly to write letters, present films, host speakers and organize other actions on behalf of victims of human rights violations. Reflecting the five current national priorities of Amnesty International USA, the Davis Community Chapter presently works for human rights victories in Darfur, Abolishing the Death Penalty, the Counter Terror with Justice campaign, Prisoners of Conscience, and the Stop Violence Against Women campaign.  They also belong to the local Progressive Coalition.
