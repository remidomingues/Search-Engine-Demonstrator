 Candidate Statement 

Hey Aggies!

My name is Amrit Kaur Sahota and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the NOW slate. I am a thirdyear Biological Sciences major with an emphasis in NPB from Elk Grove, CA.  I am currently the Student Manager of the Community Service Resource Center, president of the UC Davis Global Environmental Brigades and an advocate of domestic violence and sexual assault awareness.  My experience as an undergraduate at this university has inspired me to help enhance the Aggie experience for my peers.  I wish for them to enjoy their time as Aggies and leave UC Davis ready to take on the world to accomplish all of their endeavors.

I am running for ASUCD Senate with NOW because I know we are strong advocates of change and possess the open ears and minds required to best serve our campus.  As a senator I will strive to accomplish the following platforms:

RENOVATE AND EXPAND OUR INTERVIEW FACILITY
The University of California, Davis is a renowned public university and continues to provide us with access to impressive employers from around the world. As a student employee of the Internship and Career Center (ICC), I am familiar with the recent shift of the interview facility from the Alumni Center to South Hall.  Currently, the ICC just began the lengthy renovation project and I want to ensure the renovations have proper funds and meet students’ needs.  Currently, there are barely enough interview spaces to fit employers on an average day. Our campus must be prepared to adequately host a larger number of employers after career fairs and an increase in the average number of employers in the future as our economy continues to grow.  By collaborating with the ICC during the renovation project, I will advocate for the establishment of adequate facilities and resources to ensure students’ voices are being heard.

RAISE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS
Did you know individuals between 16 and 24 years of age are 3 times more likely to be involved in a domestically violent relationship?  This age group is the vast majority of our community.  As a student with healthrelated career goals, I have learned that prevention is the most powerful tool.  In order to prevent students from becoming victims, I want to bring a domestic violence and sexual assault awareness week to campus in order to publicize available resources, educate our community, and empower victims to stand up against domestic violence and sexual assault.  I believe taking a public stand against these issues will provide the community and victims with a support system to foster a safe campus community here at UC Davis.
