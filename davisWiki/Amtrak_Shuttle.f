The Amtrak Shuttle is a special service that picks up passengers from the Amtrak Train Station and drops them off anywhere in Davis.  20 passenger cutaways are used for the shuttle, which are the same vehicles used by Tipsy Taxi. The shuttle is very popular with freshman because they are not allowed to have cars while living in the dorms.

The shuttle leaves the Amtrak Station at 6:10 pm, 7:15 pm, and 8:45 pm, which is about 15 minutes after trains from the Bay Area are scheduled to arrive in Davis. The shuttle runs only on Sundays and selected holidays. Check the http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu/schedule/calendar/ Unitrans Service Calendar  for the exact dates that it runs. The fare is $1.00 unless you have an undergraduate Aggie card or other valid Unitrans pass.
