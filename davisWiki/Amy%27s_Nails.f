20090503 11:54:45 nbsp I came here for the first time on Friday, May 1st. The lady was kind and took me in right away to do my french manicure. Shes very attentive to the details and my nails came out looking great! As with everyone else, I received the bonus card, buffer, and nail file! I really like them and am likely to return!

20090519 22:03:22 nbsp I havent been back in awhile but I dont hate this place. The salon has ZERO ambiance and the huge mirrors in front of the foot spas are lessthan ideal, but overall I was happy with my pedi. I have been frequenting this new and fabulous spa at the Woodland Mall for the past few months, but if I am ever in Davis looking for a pedi I will definitely consider this place again!

20091027 17:48:52 nbsp nice people but environment is so so, like a hole in the wall so so. not as man colors to choose from compared to other salons but mani/pedi are adequate. you get you own files and buffer to take home and back so that minimizes germs. prices are good, college student good. nothing compares to sf salons but this is where i go when im in davis Users/tapioca.queen

20100711 22:22:04 nbsp I went here 3 months ago to get a manicure/pedicure and they were great! The lasted a long time! (about 2 weeks). I went here 2 weeks ago and this place is now called Amys Nails with a new owner and same prices. Looks the same on the outside but they made remodeled it a bit to be more spacious inside.

20100823 20:01:47 nbsp I just moved in Davis with my BF and I was looking for a Pedicure/Manicure shop.  And I found Amys Nails.  The place was really clean and Amy was very nice and friendly.  My nails are also gorgeous and I love them. My BF too! BTW Amy and her family are the new owner of the place. They seem to be a hard working family too. Users/camelliajoun

20110103 17:05:38 nbsp My friend came home extremely upset after having her acrylics removed here. Instead of soaking her nails in nail polish remover, her acrylics were removed with pliers! She complained about how much it hurt the entire time but kept being told that this was completely normal. They do a wonderful job with nail designs and manicures, but I would stay away from getting your acrylics removed here.   Users/hyangdan
