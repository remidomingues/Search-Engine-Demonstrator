20080606 15:05:04 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Amy... Im a bit confused... is your practice still in business?  The web site seems to indicate it, although you deleted the entry.  The wiki has a tradition of maintaining entries on departed businesses, even those that ceased to exist decades ago, in an effort to document the history of the town.  If youre still in practice, of course, then a current entry would be relevant.  Are you still in practice? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
