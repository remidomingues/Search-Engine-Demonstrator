 Compared to some of my friends, who seem to have much higher standards and/or more delicate tastebuds, I wouldnt say Im much of a food connoisseur or food snob. But, as you can see, I dont have places like The Old Teahouse or Quickly listed under highly recommends, mostly because my experiences with those two have been mixed and inconsistent. But I can say Ive always enjoyed the tapioca in iced coffee or iced thai tea from Thai 2k. :) I havent been to KetMoRee yet though.  AC

20100130 10:20:48 nbsp Hey Amy, I know Im replying to your comment a year and a half too late probably (haha) but no, Rita never stopped by unannounced. She would either call to let us know shed be coming, or if she did come by, it was just to say hello or to repair something. I know a lot of my neighbors had issues, but I lived there for three years and thought it was fine.  Users/AliPezeshkpour
