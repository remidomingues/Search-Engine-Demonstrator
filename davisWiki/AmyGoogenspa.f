20070806 19:50:39 nbsp I noticed your comment on the Blockbuster page and wondered if you ever filed a complaint.  If you filed it with the management (esp. in the Downtown store) know that it didnt get there because when I worked there she couldnt have cared less what customers thought.  I urge you (and anyone else you know who has complaints) to call the corporation.  I doubt theyll do anything (they treat their employees as bad as their customers) but its worth a shot.  I tried really hard when I was employed to treat customers right but was actively discouraged because it often took too long.  Thanks, from a former (and very disgruntled) employee Users/Naomi
