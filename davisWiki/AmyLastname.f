I think the daviswiki is pretty cool, and I dont even know how to use it very well.  I bet it would be more fun if I knew what was going on.

Im kind of silly, you see.  I dont like having my last name on the internet.  I had an account with daviswiki a while ago to post stuff, but I dont know where it went.  Maybe it was deleted because I didnt put my last name on there.  Dont delete me this time, wiki people!

When I was younger, my Grandmother used to tell me Dont meet internet people or give out information!  They will murder you!

My Grandma is a silly silly lady.  I love her.  Though, at times, Im still a little scared of the internet.  Thanks Grammy.

Since then, I have met Users/SallyHensel and Users/JillBenciWoodward from the internet, and Im still here.  I <3 both a lot.

I sometimes when I wonder around campus, and I see familiar faces, but I cant tell if theyre from REAL LIFE!! or from internet land.   If Im with Sally, I usually whisper I SEE INTERNET PEOPLE! and we giggle and get a little freaked out.

I did a lot of the research found here: Housing Guide and Apartments and other people on the wiki did a good job adding more/making it look pretty since I dont have any decent html skillz.  If you want further information about what I know about housing/apartments, let me know.  I went around looking at apartments for about 12 months during my spare time.  Ive seen a lot of them and I took pretty extensive notes on the places I saw.

Im pretty fun if you know me in real, nondigiform life.


AFAIK, accounts are never deleted.  Users/ArlenAbraham

I simply love your style of prose!  Its so succinct and seemingly incoherent yet it holds.  Write some more!  Users/ChristopherMckenzie
