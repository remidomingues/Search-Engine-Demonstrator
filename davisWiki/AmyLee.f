Im a student at UC Davis. I am also a resident of The Turtle House (link? gosh, Ive lived here since before Mike finished building the porch!).  I share my apartment this year with my awesome roomie Users/JeremyRoss Jeremy Ross, though I do have some pretty awesome housemates also.

I love reading reviews on the Wiki of establishments in town, especially suggestions on what to order at restaurants!  I find most of them to be pretty darn accurate and very helpful.  Some of my favorite dishes in Davis come from suggestions of Wikizens.  Occasionally I contribute my own suggestions and experiences and hope that other people find them useful!

Top 3 Chinese Restaurants in town (most authentic in my opinion):
  Hometown Chinese Food
  Shanghai Town
  Davis Noodle City Noodle City


On an unrelated note: How do you reply with a bullet point? Im still learning editing options! oh and Ive actually tried Pacos in Woodland before and they are pretty good!

20070905 17:20:52 nbsp To reply with a bullet point, hit Edit, and then put an asterisk ({{{}}}) in front of the text that you are going to write. (Plus a space between the asterisk and your text) Usually, people indent with each new response to help with continuity  to do this just put in spaces before the asterisk. Just one space will do for a single response, each additional space intents it further. Users/KarlMogel

 lets give this a try! oh and I was just talking to my roommate Jeremy Ross, who just moved into my apartment at TH, and you know him too! Users/AmyLee

20070905 18:47:04 nbsp    Dang! Thats a pretty useful tip (which I failed to retain reading any of the other pages). Users/DougWalter
  Asterisk in front of the text... Sorry to experiement on your page, Amy.
  haha no problem, I found the tip useful too! Amy

20070905 21:40:50 nbsp There are more really cool things you can do on the Help pages  more than I currently know how to do or use. Did you know you can make footnotes... I just learned that while experimenting on one of my own wikis hosted through wiki:Wikispot!

Haha, its a small city indeed, that Davis. Im quickly discovering that Madison is a small city too, 250,000peoplesmall. Tell Jeremy I said hi, and Madison has crazy preachers too. Or will, now that the undergrads are here. Users/KarlMogel

20070920 04:11:25 nbsp okay, so every time I edit my comment on the Dos page the quotes turn to that AAAAAAA symbol?? and gets worse! Can someone help me out with that, Im not sure how to get rid of it? Do I need to re paste my comment? Thanks! Users/AmyLee

20070920 08:08:24 nbsp Were you editing your comments in Microsoft Word and then pasting them in? If so go and turn off the smart quotes in Word. Users/JasonAller

20070920 16:26:43 nbsp Well, there was a lot of random stuff in both posts.  I wanted to read them (or thought I did) so I edited it primarily so I could!  But anyway, youre welcome! Users/WesHardaker

20071006 15:31:37 nbsp Hi Amy!!! haha i loved our AIM conversation via my boyfriend yesterday. lol, and thanks to your profile i now know how to reply with a bullet point too! yay!  Users/WeMo

20071007 08:50:15 nbsp Glad you enjoyed Shanghai Town Ive tried probably every item on the red menu at this point, but a great strategy is to go when its crowded, look around and say, Ill have what theyre having! Or listen to what I said on their wiki page :) Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071015 21:03:23 nbsp Sorry, Id love to know where to get that too! My best suggestion is to type in Shabu Shabu with Sacramento or Yolo County. Only time Ive really had it is in Japan... Users/AlvinTsao
