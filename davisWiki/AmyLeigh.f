I moved to Davis from the Bay Area in the fall of 08. I work at the Department of Mental Health in Sactown and I love it :).


My interests include:
Sushi buffets and burritos from Guad
Psychology
Classical novels
Gardening (to some extent, although living in an apartment kinda limits your options here)
Punk concerts
Concerts of any kind (music is better when experienced live)
