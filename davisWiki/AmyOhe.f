This user exists somewhere in California, as it has been driven out of the village of Davis for having exceeded 225 educational units. Rejoice!

It prefers warm, dry conditions in all seasons.
Its native food source is anything edible, cheap, and hopefully delicious.
It probably would eat green eggs and ham.
It really likes fruit.
If you encounter a wild Amy, try waving your arms and appearing large, as that will frighten it.


And the nonnative food source? jw
