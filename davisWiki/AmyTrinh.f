Greetings!
You must be really bored to even look at this page, since I do not participate in editing many pages on the Davis wiki. (This is something I take personal pride in.)

Bare bones list:

UC Davis Senior (09) Major: History, Enviromental Hort (greenhouse propagation), and possibly Education

Occupation(s):
  old: Assistant for Plant Sciences at http://daviswiki.org/Plant_Science_Teaching_Facility The Bowley Headhouse. (TA for PLB 1)
  Current: Conductor for Unitrans. (See photo.)
Hobbies: Being Clumsy, Wikiwhoring http://www.wikipedia.com, tteas, fantasy novels , and video games(DDR, Singstar, Pump it up, and Katamari)

Update: I have a plot now at the Experimental College Garden. I just need to find the time to weed it. And also find a rototiller (and possibly someone who can operate it without losing an appendage).
