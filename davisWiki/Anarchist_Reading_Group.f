The Anarchist Reading Group is a community group in Davis that reads Anarchy Anarchist material and discusses the previous readings in weekly meetings. Previously the group had met on Sundays at the Davis Branch Library Davis Public Library. Their first meeting was on Sunday, February 6, 2005, and are still in a formative phase for the group.   Newcomers are always welcome.

No membership is required, there are no true leaders, and any additional projects that this group might undertake are still up for debate.  They also have a http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blue_scarf/ yahoo group.

As of Summer of 2008, its unsure whether this group is still active.

20080606 12:35:20 nbsp I would guess theyre lazy and/or antiorganizing anarchists, judging from the fact that they dont seem to have done anything besides come up with a name, schedule a meeting, and establish a yahoogroup.  Im going to go out on a limb here and say it doesnt exist anymore if it ever did. Users/PhilSpear

20080606 17:51:04 nbsp I cant help but think that Davis and anarchists are mutually exclusive.  Just the same, I might go to the meeting. Users/JimStewart
