The Anchor String & Whistle Band was a Folk/Contra Dance/Celtic Revival Music Scene band in Davis from about 1978 to 1981. We used to gig about two or three times a week during the spring and summer. It was an open band, with people joining for a gig or two. Dick Holdstock was a regular as well as Mark Stringhammer, Paul Books, Janet Kurnick, and Brian Brown. Our one claim to fame was we opened for Jean Ritchie at the Palms.
