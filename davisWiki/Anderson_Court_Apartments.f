20090124 05:08:17 nbsp No real reviews yet. Ill post a quick one. Ive lived here for the past few months, Everything is pretty nice. Apartments recently remodeled. Much more attractive looking then most other apartments in Davis. Very spacious living areas: Kitchen is one of the largest Ive seen for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom place. Rent is decent, and apartment is extremely close to campus. Less than a mile. I would bike everyday in warm weather. G, J, Q, and i think B lines run near, so very good access to Unitrans. Havent used the pools/spa/gym/study lounge yet. Plan to use the pools in summer. Dont know where the study lounge is though. Anderson and Drake are basically the same thing. Parking is decent, never had a problem not finding one. Just wish their was slightly more space. Always feel like ill hit a car turning corners and backing out. Wish their was another outlet to the street/towards Drake apartments. Maintenance is pretty quick as well, pretty responsive to all requests. Your Gas utility is included by the complex, meaning your heating is free  amazing! Everything seems to work as well. No broken plugs or anything. Overall pretty good. One of the nicest to find in Davis. Went out on a whim and believed the model, it is actually a pretty accurate model. Just resigned for another year. Check them out early, apartments go really fast. Heard there is also a low turnover rate. Note: Only Anderson was remodeled recently, Drake apartments seem decent (from my friends places) but arent as new/nice looking. Users/mperkel

20090126 14:00:32 nbsp Just a heads up to the current residents: The gym has been remodeled with brand new equipment and the study lounge that is located upstairs from the gym now has wireless internet. Also, someone mentioned that the Drake had not yet been remodeled, but they have and include all the same upgrades as the Anderson Court Apartments. Users/kerrieschultz

20090312 16:22:12 nbsp We regret to inform you that there have been seven daytime breakins in a four block radius. Typically, this is occurring during the day, when nobody is home. The perpetrator has been entering the apartments by drilling a hole in the sliding glass door locks. We are working closely with the Davis Police Department, as are other apartment communities that have been affected. We are participating in the Crime Free Multi Housing Program offered by the Davis Police Department. This multifaceted program is being offered to apartment complexes across the community to combat crime.

There has been a crime alert notice from the Police Department emailed to all residents. To help lessen the threat of sliding glass door entry, we are installing additional security devices to the sliding glass doors in all ground floor units on Friday, March 13th. As an added precaution, we advise all residents to close and lock all doors and windows whenever leaving their apartment, even for short trips to the laundry room. It is up to each resident to keep their apartments as secure as possible. Please report any suspicious behavior and come to the office with any questions you may have.

20090312 22:20:23 nbsp Does anyone else notice that like half of all the outdoor lights dont work. Whether its in hallways or in the parking lot, this place is pitch black in soooo many places at night Users/FlakCannon

20090314 11:44:54 nbsp Dear residents, thank you for your continuing cooperation during this matter. The additional security devices have been installed on the sliding glass doors of all downstairs units. Please check to ensure installation and that each roommate understands the proper way to utilize the new device. If you have any questions, please contact the office as soon as possible.  Users/andersoncourtmanagement

20090314 14:32:44 nbsp Just complaints about the parking lot itself.
I am scared while turning corners someone is going to come flying around and hit me. Also fearing sudden backups.
I think a big problem is that tree in the middle of the parking lot towards the office, that should be removed.
As well as the parallel parking on the side of those apartments, getting rid of those would allow more room to drive and possibly prevent a head on accident.
Another thing that bothers me, is Drake and Anderson are the same management, why not open that gate to allow cars use of both entrances. I should be able to enter the Anderson lot from Apple street.
thx Users/mperkel

20091201 14:17:58 nbsp We are having an OPEN HOUSE on Friday, December 4th. Refreshments will be served, our model will open for viewing, and we will be giving guided tours. Before you make any decisions about where to live next year, stop by for a tour. Users/andersoncourtmanagement

20100611 15:43:56 nbsp Leasing for Fall with Amazing Deals! We have great movein specials running right now on one and two bedroom apartments. Free rent and reduced deposits! . We hope to see you soon! Users/kristenatdna

20101001 21:43:56 nbspIve recently moved here and while I find the place enjoyable, I have a HUGE problem with the parking. Like mperkel I have had problems with the parallel parking. Ive hit the cars parked in those areas twice. Luckily, there wasnt any damage caused to my car or the other owners car so there was never a need to report the incident.

The parking lot is already narrow so Im not sure why the apartment complex added those spots, especially since theres still plenty of parking available. I really hope the complex considers removing those parking spots.  Users/IndulgentReader

20110426 22:55:58 nbsp I am so surprised to see that not a lot of people have reviewed Anderson Court because its actually a really nice place to live, although i dont think its popular or commonly known, but I know Drake is (odd). Anyways, I have been living here for almost about a year (one year lease 1011) and my roommate and I really enjoy it so far! We live in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom flat and its pretty spacious compared to other places we have visited. Like the other reviewer, the kitchen is actually really nice and big, plus that and the doorway are wooden floors, while the rest of the apt is carpeted. Our bedrooms are big as well, considering we dont share, we both have extra space for anything (we have full size beds too!). Since AC/heating is free, we totally take advantage of that, and our PG&E bill usually only comes out to $2025 or less a month for electricity. Sadly, our internet (COMCAST) sucks ass, getting disconnected at least 5 times a day, but I dont think its the complexs fault or I dont know, ive gotten so used to it. The only thing we do have to complain about is that sometimes our water in the bathroom/tub turns brown when you first turn it on, but after letting it run for a minute or less, its fine. I guess the pipes are old? I dont know, but they should try to do something about that. Also my roommates rooms AC/heat vent is broken and they tried fixing it but I guess its a lost cost. The walls are thin, I hear my neighbors a lot and Im sure they hear us too, but the complex is generally really quiet ( I dont think any parties have gone on here, or I never hear anything).

The best reasons for why we really, really like Anderson Court is because they give out guest parking permits!!!! This is a HUGE plus because whenever my boyfriend comes to visit, friends, or family, I can just get a guest permit for them to park in the lot, instead of parking across Savemart or the residential areas a block away. Another big reason why we like this complex is because the management is SOOO NICE. Oh my god, I know other complexes usually give out donuts, bagels, coffee, or candy during finals week but here, they give out HELLA stuff. I remember they had bagels with cream cheese, soda/juice, water bottles, cuties, NACHOS, candy, pizza, etc., and the best part is that they dont only give it out during finals/midterm weeks, but they give it out on random days or like first/last week of school, and holidays. I remember last week, there was pasta out, but I had to run for the bus so i couldnt get any! The management team (usually two girls and one guy) are SOO nice in general, I never had a problem or disagreement with them. Also, maintenance is really quick as well, and you can always see them around during office hours. Also, they text you when you have a package waiting in their office, which is really nice, so I never not received my mail/packages before which I know has happened loads of times for other people at other complexes. You can also rent the vacuum for free at the office if you just moved in and didnt buy one yet, this is what me and my roommate did. They always have giveaways or lottery where you can get stuff like a t.v. or a free months rent.

My roommate and I are really sad we arent going to be here next school year because were getting more roommates and so we need a house. Were gonna miss Anderson Court! This is a realy great place to live, we recommend it ) Users/stephanielee

20110823 23:16:06 nbsp For the sake of time and space, I will break my review into sections.

Personal Background: I live in the twobedroom townhouse here in Anderson court. I have lived here for one school year. (I have spend nearly a month looking for apartments before choosing Anderson Court)

Pricing: AC is priced competitively given the location and amenities. Their recent remodeling have greatly propelled AC as one of the nicer apartments. This is definitely not the cheapest apartment complex found in Davis, but it’s a very good bang for the buck. For the townhouse, you will be looking to pay a little less than $500.00 for your own room. (Including utilities 2011) The place looks brand new when I first moved in. Although the construction quality of the wood floors, doors, cabinets are budget at best. (Which makes sense for the price of rent itself)

Location: You have marketplace and Anderson plaza within walking distance. It’s pretty lively here. Chevron gas station is literally right in front of you and shell is just across the street with an autoshop. My only complaint with AC is that it not that close to campus. It’s a 10 min bike ride to campus at a steady pace.

Bus Lines: J,G,B,F,Q (I’m pretty sure P does too) passes your area so if you don’t have a car/bike waiting for the bus is not that bad. Although be aware that it does get awfully crowded during the school year if you are too lazy to ride your bike.
Apartment: as far as I know but AC and Drake was remodeled and the place looks spanking new. Thick double pane windows, wood flooring in the kitchen area. One thing that I must mention regarding the townhouse (at least for AC) is that the kitchen is in the front and the living room is located at the back of the townhouse. This is great because the living room is practically another bedroom without a door. Whoever designed that is a genius.Negatives. The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors quiet well.  The little back around behind the apartment is creepy and easy targets for thieves. From what I heard there was a string of break ins because the back sliding door didn’t lock properly. Basically it’s a small alleyway and each townhouse gets a mini backyard(my roommate had his bike stolen recently) There should be a locked gate there so not just anyone can walk in there and take stuff.  The room right above the kitchen turns into an oven when somebody is cooking downstairs.

Amenities:
	2 pools. The Pool on Anderson is 38 feet deep and the one on drake is 36 plus a hot tub. The gym have 34 machines and a TV. The lounge/study room looks great but I only been there a handful of times during the year so I can’t comment on it too much.

Staff:
	No problems with management. Very nice, very professional. They also have random days where they have food, coffee, and other foods to bribe us into liking them more. It’s a little something extra that they don’t need to do and I appreciate their effort. Repair guys are always on the ball and will address your repairs the very next day. However, I am not a fan of the leaf blower at 10am and the dump truck coming at 9am

Parking: Parking is heavily enforced here. They WILL tow you if you don’t have a permit or a gust parking pass. They do not mess around. Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is up to you.  They also have curiosity patrol that swings by once or twice each night (Although it looks like they are there to check for permits rather than our actual security). WARNING: PARKING IS TIGHT. If you have a fancy car, I advise you to park at the very back to avoid being clipped. My girlfriends car is an unfortunate victim of tight spaces/tenants inability to park their cars.

Security concerns: The alley between the townhouses needs a lock gate. Personally I think thats huge security risk. There have been a string of robberies near that area including Anderson/Darke, but mostly due to students leaving their doors/windows opened or unlocked. ( lock your doors and windows and dont have your expensive toys visible)

Hope this helps.

Update:

I was a little surprised when we got our security deposit back. My housemates and I spend a substantial amount of time cleaning our apartment prior to moving out but we lost a good chunk of our deposit due to cleaning.  Maybe they repaint the entire apartment regardless of how well its kept. This is probably why when I first moved in the place looks brand new.

20111004 10:19:24 nbsp I lived here last year in a 2 bedroom apartment.  While living here, the management was helpful and prompt. They offered free food on certain days of the week and was overall nice and friendly.

That being said, I am appalled by they way they handled everything after we moved out.  My roommate and I paid $500 for the deposit.  We expected to get at least some of it back, but much to our shock, they say that we actually owe them.  According to the deposit summary, we owe them $363 for cleaning fees and painting and another $192 for having lived there until the end of our lease.  The $192 I understand because of the way our lease is, but the cleaning fees are ridiculous.  My roommate and I thoroughly cleaned our apartment prior to moving out.  Everything in the apartment was left the way it was when we first moved in.  They claim that they had to clean the entire place after we left.  If we had known that they would be charging us for cleaning our apartment, we wouldnt have bothered cleaning up before leaving.  Our apartment was used as a model apartment on more than one occasion over the course of the year, so it was kept clean throughout the duration of our stay.  In addition to our own cleanup, whatever cleaning they did have to do in preparation for the new residents was minimal at most and in no way would accrue to a cost of $363.  If I had known that this is how they would treat us, I would have left a warning to prospective residents early on.

Everything from the management to the apartments themselves arent what they seem.  They give off the appearance of being nice and new, but if you look a little closer youll see that its just a poor attempt to cover whats underneath.  The original layer of old linoleum, the cheap pieces of wood siding along the walls are still there, hidden by the poorly measured and roughly cut pieces of hardwood flooring and layers upon layers of cheap white paint.  Just brushing against the wall leaves black stains.  The doors dont fit into the door frames properly and the windows allow moisture in during the wet season allowing mold to grow along the sides.  Dont get me wrong, its a nice place to live in during the year and youre treated kindly, but be prepared to be swindled out of your deposit when you move out. Users/SharonLee

I lived at Anderson Court Apartments this past year and had mixed to negative feelings. There are definitely positive aspects to living there but there are also a whole lot of NEGATIVES.

Pros: The office and maintenance staff were always friendly and prompt when handling apartment issues. Fun activites and contests were held throughout the year. Residents have 2 large pools to access (Anderson and Drake are connected and owned by the same property owner so Anderson Court residents can use their amenities as well). Also, there are various laundry facilities located throughout the complex so you’re never caught in a bad situation when all the machines in the laundry room are taken.

Cons: While living there, burglaries occurred nearly 5 times throughout our stay which was strange because the complex employs a security company. What does this security company do if they’re not walking around the complex making sure nothing is amiss? They’re in the parking lot recording which cars are parked without a permit. After which, they call the local tow truck company to tow away vehicles and then proceed to hang out in their cars. I find it interesting that I witnessed them doing this at about the same time a burglary was reported to have taken place in the complex. I never ever saw them patrolling outside of the parking lots. In addition, they have HORRIBLE parking. It’s very limited and very narrow. If someone can’t find parking, I recommend parking on Apple Lane. Lastly, they completely rob you of your security deposit. My roommate and I were not students. We were UCD employees and worked in Davis and Sacramento. We were not home often but always maintained a clean apartment. In fact, our apartment was used twice as a model apartment. The first time they came in and took pictures and the second time they brought in UCD Housing representatives to take a short tour to see what the apartments were like as they were considering renting out several units for UCD housing. After moving out, we learned that they were charging us the full amount for cleaning, painting and labor. I have NEVER had this experience. My roommate and I previously lived at The Colleges at La Rue for 4 years and received our full deposit back plus interest when we moved out. We have always been clean and made sure to thoroughly clean the apartment prior to moving out. Due to all of this, I will NEVER recommend this apartment to anyone. Users/LyndaLe

 In response to the two statements above:
	We would like to thank Lynda and Sharon for allowing us to show your apartment throughout the year. We also invite you both to make an appointment to discuss your cleaning and painting charges and to clarify your rent owed from September 1 through the end of your lease.Users/KMSchultz
