There is a building next to Mace Boulevard, near where it crosses over Interstate 80, that is surrounded by very tall and noticeable palm trees.  There is a sign there that reads Anderson Farms Co.  This company is involved in rice production and employs about 100 people. Current estimates show this company has an annual revenue of 4,600,000. If there is more information about this company, please add it!

Anderson Farms also has many cats. A few years ago they had about 75 Feral Cats, they were TNRd, but many of them were sick, and some died before they were trapped, some after, and some had to be humanely euthanized because they were suffering, and in pain. There are now about 2025 cats there.
