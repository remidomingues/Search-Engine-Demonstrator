20061211 11:26:16 nbsp We had one half of our houses windows replaced by Anderson Glass.  As soon as we can afford the rest AG will replace the remaining half.  Darren and Matt did a very thorough job, from planning (local companies have the best knowlege of Davis building code) through the framing and finish work.   Users/RobiPochapin

20091107 12:40:55 nbsp We just had our old aluminum windows and sliding door replaced with vinyl doublepane by Anderson. Although it took a little bit of time to get a date set for an estimate, once that happened everything moved very quickly. The work was completed in a day, and the windows look great! Darrin and the guys are very friendly and professional, are very good at what they do, and their prices are competitive. I would definitely hire them again!  Users/EmilyTho

20100812 10:00:30 nbsp After weeks of attempting to get a contractor out to our house with no luck, a friend suggested we try Anderson Glass. Darrin was so helpful and came out the next day to give us a quote. Our new screen doors were installed shortly after and were very happy with the results. Users/EmmyMelton

20110104 11:38:05 nbsp A quick call to this place for a broken front window and they had someone out within 30 minutes of my call, Very friendly staff and good prices. About 80 for labor and 40 for the actual window glass, single pane standard window. Highly recommend this company  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20140502 10:10:47 nbsp This review is about repairing auto glass. I went to Anderson Glass because I have been happy with their work in the past, but that was for other types of glass or plexiglass.  I had a tiny crack in my windshield.  I would have just ignored it except that it was in front of the drivers right shoulder and at eye level.  Now the crack is gone, but instead I have two very obvious dots that are every bit as bad as the crack was. I asked if there was anything they could do to make the dots less obvious and they said no in a rude way.   They should have offered to refund my money.  If you need auto glass repaired, you should go somewhere else.  Users/SusanSlaughter
