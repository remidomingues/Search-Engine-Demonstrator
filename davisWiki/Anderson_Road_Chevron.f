They have both Gas Stations gas and food... what a treat!

This stations gas is routinely 1520 cents higher than the nearby AM/PM Arco AM/PM, but is competitive with the Davis Shell Shell station across the street. A benefit of this station is that they accept credit cards.



20090515 20:11:44 nbsp the guy here is an AHOLE. i filled up but their credit machine was down and somehow he didnt have a merchant id to give to the computer. he made me go to the atm machine that charges me a fee + my bank a fee. He promised to repay that amount but then changed his mind to only the atm fee, not the bank fee. argued for a looooong time before he gave me the rest. hes super rude and acted as if it was my fault that my credit card was bad... even though it was obviously the machine.
