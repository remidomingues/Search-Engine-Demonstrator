20120505 09:55:08 nbsp Hi, you might notice I restored the comment you deleted on the Sterling Pointe Apartments page.  I did this because it is typically frowned upon to delete other peoples comments.  However, I agree that it is super shady, and I put a warning above it so people know it is probably a shill. Have a lovely day! Users/LoriOrf
