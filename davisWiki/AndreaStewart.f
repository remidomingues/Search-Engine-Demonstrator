About: Welcome to my wiki page!  Its about time!  I graduated UC Davis in 2004 with a Bachelors in Economics.  I worked for Target for a short time, during which a piece of my soul was sucked away.  I now work as an office monkey for the state government in Sacramento and I commute from Davis.  I also work parttime as a freelance illustrator, and I am finishing the rough draft to my first novel.  My lifetime goal is to write novels fulltime and be allowed to illustrate their covers.

I currently own, or am owned by, two very mischievous cats, Amazu and Zorro, and two cockatiels.  Once in a while, I host nerdtastic events at my apartment, including Star Trek: TNG marathons (complete with drinking game!), themed potlucks, LAN parties, a LotR marathon, Mafia games, etc., etc.

If you see me around, feel free to say hi!  In the time I have left over, I enjoy devouring books whole, swimming, hiking, backpacking, $1 bottle nights at Sudwerk, and going to movies on their opening nights (I love the enthusiasm).

About my Art:

I work in a variety of mediums  digital, colored pencil, pencil, acrylics, oils, and watercolor.  Like most artists, Ive been drawing as long as I can remember, and painting nearly as long as that.  Digital paintings, such as Helen, I create by using a pressuresensitive tablet, stylus, and Adobe Photoshop CS.  Its very much like painting traditionally (I use the same techniques as I do with oils), except the output appears on a screen instead of a canvas.

I used to accept commissions for portraits/landscapes/whatever, but I am currently working on putting together a portfolio in order to get book cover work.  I may still accept work if a) I could put it in my portfolio, b) you offer me a heinous sum of money, or c) you have something to trade.  Im interested in electronic gadgets (a laptop, specifically), car help, and other artwork.  I tend to sell my originals pretty fast.  The only ones I have available at the moment are Dance of Blades and Hedgewitch.

About my Writing:
Errrr...uhhhh...Lets start out broad and work our way in.  Im working on a fantasy epic.  Its set in a Moroccoish country ruled by an oligarchy of three Seats.  Things get...complicated.  The plot of the first book is dominated by the struggle for the First Seat  the most powerful position in the country, and, at the start of this book, the only ruling position available due to a military coup.  The subplots (all tied in to the main plot) involve a class struggle, a race on the brink of extinction, and a boy who, unknowingly, holds the key to a secret longburied in the countrys past.

One sentence summary:  Rajheem, orphan and minstrel, becomes inadvertently caught up in the violent political struggles of his country.

There.  That just about says it all.

Helen, the woman in my painting above, is the primary antagonist in my story.  Im very fond of her.

About my Office Monkeying: I spend 8 hours/day swinging in a jungle gym and eating bananas.  Sometimes I get coffee.


   Glad you commented on the Taliesin the Cat Taliesin Cat page.  It left me curious to check out yours, and I had a chance to see your awesome art!  Great pictures!   Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
   I think your art is awesome too. The picture of Helen reminds me of something from Terry Goodkind, have you ever read anything by him?   Users/NickSchmalenberger
