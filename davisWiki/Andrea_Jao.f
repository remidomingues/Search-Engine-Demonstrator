 Candidate Statement 

Hey Aggies!

My name is Andrea Jao, I am a third year international relations and economics double major. I have been involved in ASUCD since my sophomore year. I have worked with both the city of Davis community and oncampus clubs, serving as a commissioner for the External Affairs Council and as a member of the Outreach Assembly.

Aside from the fancy titles, I am just a student like you. As students, we juggle between classes, clubs, friends, etc. while trying to make the college experience a blast. Sometimes it gets tough. And, we can all use some help here and there. As commissioner, you learn just how many resources and opportunities ASUCD has available. I was inspired – if there was only someone who would bridge students’ needs with those resources, students could benefit so much more! I decided, and now I know I can! I am organized, analytical, and synergetic. I seek to first understand our community. I want to help ASUCD to help you succeed, which is why I am running for the senate. I have the experiences, and I have the devotion to do even more. You and I and the ASUCD, we can do this college thing together! We can face challenges. We can get through the stress. We can have a way to voice our needs and have it heard! So dear Aggies, let me serve you – let me represent YOU because together, we can do so much more!

1) MORE TEST MATERIALS VENDING MACHINES.

Running late to your midterm but don’t have a scantron? In need of a bluebook for your final at 8 am but the bookstore is closed? Testing materials vending machines will be a convenient supplement to our campus. You will be able to purchase testing materials from more places than just the MU or Olson.

2) RESOURCES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND ACTIVE OUTREACH TO CLUBS.

Our student clubs frequently need extra support or a place to voice their concerns. However, on a large campus such as UC Davis, there may oftentimes be a disconnect between resources and needs. Even when there is a bridge, it might not be an easy one to get across.

As a senator, I intend on actively outreaching to student clubs to understand their oncampus experiences, listen to their suggestions, and voice their concerns. I will do so through utilizing and cooperating with existing ASUCD commissions and units that already work with clubs on various aspects and for various schoolwide events. There needs to be a first step to create a sufficient and permanent exchange of knowledge between ASUCD and clubs in order to improve future cooperation.

Applying for funds shouldn’t be complicated. Becoming a sports club and gaining school backing should not be met with difficult hurdles. Reserving event and practice spaces should not be a headache. Ultimately, clubs should feel more supported and that acquiring resources and opportunities are easy and straightforward.

Vote ANDREA JAO #1 Senate,

SMART #26, and FIGUEROA/KAPPES for ASUCD President/VP!
