20120206 12:03:37 nbsp I worked with Andrea 3 1/2 years ago and landed a wonderful job with the university. She helped tune my resume and cover letter, provided insight on how to navigate the screening process and helped me prepare for interviews. She was honest, responsive and professional, and I feel I would not be in my current job without her guidance. Users/JohnONeill
