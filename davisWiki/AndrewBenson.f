 About Me 

Hello, Im Andrew. Im a UCD undergrad in my third year, double majoring in Political SciencePublic Service and Economics. Ive been in an intern in the state legislature and Congress. I currently work for the California Energy Commission in Sacramento. Im a total politics junky and policy wonk.

Im from SoCal originally, but I love it here in Davis. SOOOOO glad I picked it over Berkeley, though the Regents Schoalrship that UCD offered me also made the decision quite easy. Being close to Sacramentobut in a quaint, bikeable small town is great.

Other miscellaneous things about me:
  I used to play viola in the UCDSO, but I stopped as of this year. The time commitment was becoming a drag; there have been so many classes that I havent been able to take because of  schedule conflicts with rehearsal.
  I also play violin, bass guitar, and ocarina (on the iPhone, that is, lol).
  Im a fanatic of strategy gamesboard games and computer games, alike. Settlers of Catan, Risk, Carcasonne, Age of Empires, Civilization... I could go on and on.
  I like to keep in shape by running, swimming laps, and hitting the gym.
  I cant go 20 minutes without thinking or saying something ironic.

I enjoy messing with peoples perceptions:
  Depending on what Im wearing for the day, I dress like a SoCal surf rat but Ive been extremely academicallyfocused my entire life.
  People who first get to know me think Im uptight, but I get enjoy getting drunk at parties, I dont mind when other people smoke pot around me, and go on random adventures for the hell of it.
  Im gay, but I pass as straight without even trying. Coming out was pretty much a complete surprise to everyone I know.
  Im a total nerd, but Im also quite fit.

Oh, and one other thing: Im single and quite eager to change that. Meeting gay guys who are my type here in Davis has proven to be quite the challenge. Any advice or interest on how to fix that is quite appreciated ;)
