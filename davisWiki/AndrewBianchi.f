What if we dont use facebook? Can one wiki you as a means of contact?  Users/StevenDaubert
  Good question. If anyone not on facebook feels the need to contact me, my email can be found on the UC Davis people search, but I do check wiki every now and then. Andrew

Yep... just copy and paste it.  If youre doing it for a public entry (restaurant reviews, etc), the rule of thumb that was figured out a couple years ago was one year back, rounded up, cut off at the calendar year or a management changeover.  Thats keeping it simple and a calendar year cut off is arbitrary enough to not be an issue of where to cut the reviews off.  When I do it, I tend to use the formatting from Nobu Hiro, but theres a slight variation here and there by different editors.  Of course, if youre just talking about personal comments, all this is moot. Users/JabberWokky

Follow the advice you give others and hold yourself to it as well. You defend a friend yet you go as far as to make a claim that I would call the cops because of a campaign? Users/GregWebb
