 In the Beginning ... 

He was born and he lives. Men and women speculate that he was born in Houston Texas, but some claim he was born in former Czechoslovakia and forged his birth certificate so that he could run for president.

 The Plot Thickens! 

He went to wiki:dentonwiki:UNT North Texas. He also plays the cello.

 ... and Today 

He has a B.S. degree in mathematics. He started wiki:dentonwiki DentonWiki. I also heard a rumor that hes going to live in Africa!

20100914 18:48:13 nbsp Good luck with DentonWiki. Youve guys got quite a bit of content already.... definitely off to a good start! What kinds of plans are you making for community outreach?  Users/WilliamLewis

20100924 08:15:22 nbsp Somehow missed this comment for ten days. Anyways, my superlong community outreach comment:

The beginning was mostly netbased. First, before even starting the wiki, I ran a campaign on Facebook. That way about a hundred people were actively aware and liked the idea before they even saw a site. Then I made the site all green and shiny, and got Ritch and Novas help adding some content, before announcing the site to those people who had joined the Facebook group. Additional campaigning has taken place on Facebook and LiveJournal. Ritch made two funny YouTube videos about DentonWiki (a tutorial and a general statement of purpose), which were broadcast through those media.

We began doing some reallife outreach concurrently. So far weve done flyering on both wiki:dentonwiki:The Square and the wiki:dentonwiki:University of North Texas UNT campus and held a DentonWiki Day on the square where some people who hadnt been involved before got to walk around with the group, take photos of locations, and brainstorm.

Ive got a few other people on board I do know (Ritch, Nova, Erin, Michael) and already a couple active editors who have contacted me since that I didnt (Alex, Josh).

So, future ideas: I plans to organize and give a few quick talks at meeting of UNTbased groups to show off the site, explain the purpose, and give a basic demonstration of how to edit articles (on campus I have contacts, and the meeting rooms have projectors). We also plan to hold a larger DentonWiki Day and an editing party. Eventually, wed like a group that gets together regularly to have meetings where they discuss and edit the wiki together. Also planning to keep up and possibly expand netbased outreach.

Concerns: These strategies mostly contact college students, who though are in general more tech savvy are also just one part of the Denton community. Note the already complete documentation of the bars versus the near absence of articles on other important subjects. Also, Im already not in Denton most of the time and am leaving the continent at the beginning of next year, so Ill have to hand all this over to other people.

So ... yeah. Any helpful suggestions or criticisms? Users/AndrewBroz
   For year one, dont worry about a heavy college demographic, just keep a steady hand in making sure the content doesnt get student focused.  Youll get lots of content that way, and most editors will understand that it is the DentonWiki, not the UNT Wiki.  After you get content and have something to bring to other groups, youre going to have a much more memorable impression (youll have something to show, rather than describing theory and referring to other wikis).  Never underestimate the impact of seeing local information and feeling you have a connection to the content.  The hurdle tends to be the concept that you can edit it.  You might want to read Cut that comment bar out for some content growth patterns that can have long term social editing consequences.   Trust the community; it tends to pay off.
