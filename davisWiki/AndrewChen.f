I was an Undergraduate Students undergrad and Grad Students grad student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCD. I have since moved to Folsom.

 Things I miss about Davis/UCD 
 1. Bicycling  Gas is expensive.
 1. Palms Playhouse  My favorite concert venue.
 1. KDVS  Its just not the same listening online.
 1. Kerberos Login  No more NewsBank access :(
 1. Mondavi Center  1/2off student tickets to amazing shows.

20051217 00:06:18 nbsp Im not really a fan of side by siding. It does make better use of screen space, but it greatly reduces flexibility. I think a best of both worlds approach would be to put photos to the right of the template information. My 2 cents. Users/SteveDavison
  Even with photos on the right, there can still be considerable blank space between the info and the photos. Subway was pretty horrible with everything in one column.  AndrewChen

20060115 18:50:34 nbsp Thank you for fixing the formatting on the index table on the People page. It looks much better. Users/JasonAller

20060604 13:31:32 nbsp The original map was cut off there, and I wasnt sure.  If you know an official statement of the boundaries, post it to the Zip Codes entry and Ill update the map.  Otherwise, Ill update it in a few days with at least your corrections. Users/JabberWokky

20060802 16:02:22 nbsp Try contacting Harps Etc. in Walnut Creek for a regulator recommendation.  The store has a 50+ instrument inventory, so they probably know somebody.  http://harpsetc.com/contactus.php Users/JudithTruman

20060827 08:25:21 nbsp Hi, Andrew.  Thanks for creating the UCD language program pages!  I renamed them because at first glance I thought Italian what?   Italian restauarants?  Italian people?  A group of people who get together to speak Italian for fun?  {click}   Oh, an Italian language program at UCD. Users/GrahamFreeman

20070501 00:38:44 nbsp Thanks, that gives me requester private data is incorrect. The letter I remember said something like people are excited about this one tree, but all trees die and forests as a whole are more important. Does newsbank have any sort of permalink for articles? I havent used it  very much, maybe I can look for it at the Davis branch of the county library or Shields. Or microfilm even, it should be from January or February 2006. Thanks again. Users/NickSchmalenberger
