Andrew Harrison is a 4thyear Medieval Studies major (yes that is a real thing) from the nearby small town of Loomis, CA. He used to major in Computer Science before realizing that he doesnt care about Big O, divideandconquer algorithms and memorizing 9,001 network acronyms, though sometimes he misses programming.  He takes the most pleasure in the littlest activities, and thus his ultimate goal in life is to play video games, read books, eat food and hang out with friends until he dies from a surfeit of fun (or lampreys, whichever happens first).

Andrew, as mentioned above, has a passion for video games of the roleplaying persuasion, but hell play just about anything.  Hes also into other nerdy activities such as Dungeons and Dragons.  When his insomnia isnt kicking in, Andrew is an Olympic sleeper.

The Harrison family has a history with UC Davis (both parents, 2 aunts and a brother have attended) and Andrew is the latest little Harrison to attend.  Andrew lives in Portage Bay Apartments, where he is very satisfied with the friendly atmosphere, beautiful grounds and saintly apartment manager.

Andrew encourages you to game nicely, not to kill people for their sniper rifle and to keep in mind that corpse humping is very gauche.

20070923 07:50:42 nbsp Thanks for answering the question. If you take a look around at some of the other pages on the wiki you might get some ideas about how to make the Halo page relevant. Dont worry too much that it got deleted, it can always be reverted back into existence or recreated. Take a look for instance at DDR or some of the other game pages. Users/JasonAller

20070923 10:51:06 nbsp Sorry about deleting your pae, it is just a habit of mine, perhaps making a page on halo in the sense of the community of players in Davis, you may even want to start a club or something for video games, use wellman hall perhaps, with a few xboxes hooked into a nice network switch it could be fun. As for a gaming club, DRAGON is the only one I know of, but there is likely another one out there, SPAC should have a list somewhere of all the registered clubs. ~DavePoole oh and welcome to the wiki.

20081122 11:39:28 nbsp I hope its not too late...

There is a 4th Ed. D&D game running regularly at DRAGON. Im not in it and not affiliated with it, because I do not like 4th Ed. at all. In fact I do not even know whos running it. One of my friends played in it for a while, but switch games so I believe there is an open seat.
Just drop by some time and ask! Users/MasonMurray
