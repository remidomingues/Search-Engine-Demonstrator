This is me. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v173/matedog/kink4.jpg

I graduated the spring of 2005 with a degree in engineering civil engineering but Im sticking around for another year. I had a show for two quarters at KDVS. Im also known as one of the Drum Whores at UC Davis, playing in many bands in the last four years. In some circles, Im known as Cadillac Jonze. Since graduating, Ive upped my livejournal whoredom due to boredom at work
