AndrewPeake has a page on the wiki




Im not convinced that it was a mistake, considering the amount of LEAD promotion shes been doing. Users/JosephBleckman

Id like to be able to trust that, but in this case considering her campaign so far, I dont think I can. Users/JosephBleckman

I wanted to clarify how your last name was pronounce so I wouldnt mispronounce in conversation.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

so do you think the petition is futile given your, Rob and Arlens efforts? A coop cafe sounds AMAZING given that it preserves the lounge feel of Roma. Users/EliseKane

Thats a great idea! Im glad. ) Users/EliseKane

p.s. Maybe you guys can start a wiki page for the cause because this and facebook are the first forums I thought of to approach. Im not usually such an activist in these cases but I do love the Roma feeling, so the coop sounds fantastic.

20080528 21:05:57 nbsp Hi Andrew! Thanks for your message. I tried to condense all of the info, especially on Eddie Lees page, to protect him or whosever page it is. I think that since its been a year (or more, in the cases of some of the other pages I edited), we should really move on from this stuff on the wiki. I dont get why we have to keep stuff up online, even if it true, for things that really are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things. I dont know whats true and whats not, and I think thats a problem. How were you involved in the situation? Maybe you can shed some more light on it for me. Users/PS2

   The wiki is a good longterm medium.  Its interesting to read about past issues.  For perspective: you cant dig through the Aggie archives and remove old stories.  The wiki is a local resource and reflects local things (small potatoes).  Users/PhilipNeustrom
