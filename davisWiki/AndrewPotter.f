I was a transfer student here in 2007 before getting a BS in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Now Im in the PhD program in the same department. My studies are mostly in Computer Architecture, but I try to keep strong on my CS fundamentals. I also like to read Science Fiction and Fantasy novels, listen to Vocaloid music, and am generally up for going out to any sort of state historical park. Or any outdoor activity. Or any activity. I need to get out of the house more often!

 My Undergrad Program 
I double majored in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. It seemed like a cool idea at the time. But it was really a pain (the stress was literally physically painful at times); so much so I cant really say its worth it. If you find some random class interesting, it might be a better idea to just audit it if you dont need it.

For aspiring computer engineers, I would suggest cutting back on the DSP and EM classes and instead pick up the advanced device physics and circuits courses, particularly the digital circuits/VLSI stuff. And overall it really sucks to take more than 4 classes a quarter. If you want to overachieve, I would suggest getting involved with research instead; if you have half a clue, any research group can find something for you to do. You just need to speak up!

But here is what I took:

Spring 2009:
EEC130B  Electromagetics II. Better than 130A in that there is more new material to learn. Downside: More new material to learn.
EEC152  Digital Signal Processing. The lab is a fucking nightmarethe board never does what it should!
EEC171  Parallel Computer Architecture. I was frightened that this class would be a lot of work, but it is pretty chill. I highly recommend this class  goes into depth on modern architecture design. Best undergrad class in the major!
EEC181  Application Specific Processor. I took this the first time it was offered. Not sure what to say.

Winter 2009:
ECS 122A  Algorithms. This class is 95% a repeat of ECS 60. I guess it is important if you didnt get it the first time around, but a snoozefest if you did.
EEC130A  Electromagnetism I. Basically a repeat of physics.
EEC151  Instrumentation. This class is good for analog folks I guess. Its basically about LabVIEW and opamps.
EEC172  Microcontrollers  Thats what this class is really about: Using a microcontroller to interface with stuff. The prelab quizes are killer.
EEC183  Verification of Digital Systems. What can I say? This is an easy class, but does involve some work at the beginning when you make your CPU.
EEC 281  VLSI for DSP w/ Baas. Awesome class.

Fall Quarter 2008:
ECS 150  Operating Systems. Pretty much what you would expect: screwing around with schedulers and crap.
EEC 150B  Signals and Systems II, a first course in DSP. It is more about the math that you will need later for DSP.
EEC 170  Computer Architecture. This is where you learn how you take an ALU and build the stuff around it to make a CPU.
EEC 196  Issues in Engineering Design, snooze.
EEC 250  Linear Systems and Signals. They might as well call this Linear Algebra.
POL 114  Quantitative Analysis of Political Data, or more affectionately, Stats for Polisci, lol.

Spring Quarter 2008:
EEC 180B  Digital Systems II. Lectures were about how FPGAs work and.. um..  stuff. If you kick ass at boolean logic, then this class is a snoozer. The class introduces Verilog programming, but IMHO doesnt say enough about best practices. In retrospect, A LOT of digital design interview questions come out of this class, so take in as much as you can!
EEC 150A  Signals and Systems I. The content is just a recap of differential equations and Laplace transforms, and leads up to the Fourier transform. If you like math youll like this class.
EEC 110A  Electronic Circuits I. Seems easy enough until you have to remember everything for the final.
ENG 117A  Shakespeare: Early Works. My professor is great, very interesting lectures. twas fun, but I got Bs on my essays. I guess Im not very insightful.
UWP 104A  Reports and Technical Writing with Dr Sententia. Twothumbs up, take this class; helped me impress my bosses during my summer internship.

Winter Quarter 2008:
EEC 100  Circuits II with Chang.
EEC 140A  Device Physics I.
EEC 180A  Digital Systems I with alAsaad. If you know your boolean algebra, you will do very well in this class. EEs who dont know Boolean from Boole have more trouble.
ENG 190  Professional Responsibilities of Engineers. Lots of applicable information, but the 1.5 hour lectures do drag.

Fall Quarter 2007:
STA 120  Probability for Engineers with Jimmy Jiang. Very straightforward course on Probability.  Was a little on the easy sidemaybe I should have taken 131A?
PHY 9D  Modern Physics with Dr. Harris. Excellent professor. Not too overwhelming if you keep up with your homework.
ECE 70  Assembly Language with ChenNee Chuah. Covers MIPS architecture. A good chunk of the course is on binary number representationstwos compliment and IEEE floating point. The other focus is stack and frame pointers. In the end we wrote a TAL assembler in TAL. It was fun, but I would have done better if I had spent more time testing my code.
ECS 60  Data Structures and Algorithms with Sean Davis. Good times, look forward to much thinking and programming. The homework sets usually had 1 or 2 nontrivial problems as well, so get started on everything in this class early.

Summer II 2007:
Math 22B  Easy if your teacher treats the class like its full of engineers, tough if your teacher treats you like math majors.
ENG 6  Too easy. You just have to learn to use  MATLAB. Basic trig is used, thats about it. Oh, do yourself a favor and use MATLAB in all your other engineering classes after this. That way you wont be a graduating senior in EE who only knows how to plot things in Excel.

20091125 00:53:55 nbsp Yup, I was. I swear Im not one of the crazies asking for UCD to be a sanctuary campus or an official apology for something that hasnt been properly investigated. ) Users/WilliamLewis

20091125 01:00:31 nbsp I used the protest to procrastinate writing a paper. Oops, looks like another allnighter. \ Users/WilliamLewis
