  Thanks! This is my first wiki, but so far it seems like I havent messed it up too badly. Im working on reading all of the introductory stuff this week. Users/AndrewWaag

20101007 10:14:33 nbsp Hi Andrew, would you be interested in having the Davis Peoples Free School post your free events on their winter calender? for more info, daviswiki.org/dpfs Users/BrettAnneBalamuth

20101018 14:25:12 nbsp Hey, I renamed the Student Investors and Entrepreneurs entry and corrected all links on the wiki to it.  If you look through the organizations, they are pretty much always simply the name of the organization (that goes for pretty much all wiki content).  Keeping it predictable helps people find the entry so it doesnt get duplicated and is easier to link.  A search for SIE still brings it up as the top match.  On a different but related topic, I also created a new entry, Past Student Organizations.  If you could double check that my characterization of what happened to the Junior Investors and Entrepreneurs group is correct, Id appreciate it (and of course, feel free to correct it!).
