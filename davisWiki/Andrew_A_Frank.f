Image(andyfrank.jpg, thumbnail, 250, right,Photo by Sylvia Wright, UC Davis.)Andrew Alfonso Frank (Andy Frank) is a professor in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at UC Davis who is working on electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles.


Andy Frank is the inventor of the plugin hybrid electric vehicle (http://mae.ucdavis.edu/faculty/frank/frankphevdefinitions.html PHEV a.k.a. REEV or EREV).  His vehicle research programs have been instrumental in the development of the hybrid vehicle as a viable commercial technology.  Other programs under his watch have included the Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) team, and several super mileage vehicles that set world records of 3300 mpg on gasoline and 2200 mpg on M85 Methanol gasoline blend.  Dr. Frank and his students produced record winning PlugIn Hybrid Vehicles, including a Ford Taurus PHEV that got 68 mpg and a Chevrolet Suburban PHEV that got 32 mpg. Both of these vehicles got 60 miles of All Electric Range. Andy has also worked closely with the late Paul MacReady of AeroVironment, a Monrovia, CA based company responsible for the development of the GM EV1, as well as various human and solar powered aircraft.  It is rumored that he has, or once had, the worlds only Porsche pickup (a modified Porsche 914.)

Andy Frank is also Chief Technology Officer at http://localwiki.net/dixon/Efficient_Drivetrains_Inc Efficient Drivetrains Inc (EDI). They have licensed Andys patents on invention of the PHEV from UC Davis and are working on their commercial development.

Andy drives the Volt plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) as his only car.  He goes to work every day in Dixon 15 miles from his house in Davis along I80 at speeds sometimes topping out close to 80 mph.  In addition, daily errands to the grocery, hardware and drug stores are run in the Volt. Andy recharges his Volt at home and at work with a simple, inexpensive 110 volt charger. With an electric range of 35 miles, Andys Volt runs purely on electricity on most work days, but automatically switches to running on gasoline whenever a longer distance is driven. There is no sacrifice in the utility of the PHEV compared to the conventional car.

Andys Volt now has traveled a total of 23,000 miles, 70% on electricity and 30% on gasoline. The Volt has traveled 16,400 miles on electricity. The electric use is about .350 kiloWatthrs/mile. At a cost of electricity of $.13/kiloWatthrs in California the Volt costs $.05 per mile when running on electricity. The Volt has traveled 6600 miles on gasoline and used 175 gallons of gasoline at a fuel economy of 38 mpg. With recent gas prices of about $4/gallon fuel costs for the Volt are $.11 per mile when running on gas. Thus, fuel costs are dramatically lower for the Chevy Volt PHEV than for a conventional gas engine car.

In the US our electricity is generated mostly from domestic power sources, so powering our cars with electricity reduces our dependence upon imported crude oil. If everyone were to buy PHEVs like the Volt, this country could become energy independent, using mostly solar and wind power to generate the electricity to run our cars and trucks within about 15 years. As we modernize our electric power grid to use more renewable, green power sources in the future this will also reduce the pollution and greenhouse gases that we produce from our vehicles. Andy and his wife are planning to add photovoltaic solar panels to his roof at home in the near future. The best place to add solar is at your place of work where you normally park your car during the daylight hours.  Andy will try to convince his employer that it would be to the companys advantage to have 400 square feet of solar panels in the front of their south facing building!!  Then the electric cars owned by the employees can be charged on green, renewable, nonpolluting solar power.

Q: One of the Eco Barons you showcase, Professor Andy Frank, has been working for decades to perfect a plugin hybrid car. Why has Detroit been so ambivalent about this innovation, and will their current financial woes finally force them to embrace it?
A: As Andy Frank sees it, Detroit has been slow to embrace electric and plugin hybrid cars out of fear of change, out of arrogance, and because selling a clean, zeroemissions electric car that really works would make all their other products look dirty and inefficient. This is why the Big Three has continually claimed that electric cars were impractical, even though Frank has been building great prototypes for years (sometimes under contract with the same Detroit automakers). The truth is that technology is no longer a barrier, and that practical electric and plugin hybrid cars could have long ago been the standard had Detroit put is marketing muscle behind the idea.

A plugin hybrid can recharge its batteries from a domestic power supply. For short, everyday journeys the vehicles can operate almost entirely on battery power, reducing fuel costs and emissions. Widespread adoption of plugin hybrids could also have implications for energy distribution, as the vehicles could act as an energy store when plugged in and not in use.

The value of the dollar has been going down internationally because we’re shipping so much of our money abroad to buy oil, Frank said. The plugin hybrid gives us a chance to stop using oil and start using domestic energy sources. He also adds that these innovative breakthroughs can pave the way for global change. Once we shift from using oil to using electricity, we can start supplying the electricity by solar and wind, Frank said.
