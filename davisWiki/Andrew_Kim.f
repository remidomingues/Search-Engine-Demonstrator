Fall 2007 Election


 Candidate Statement 

I am ANDREW KIM and I am running for the ASUCD SENATE. ASUCD has been described to me as a system that is occasionally counterproductive and ineffective because of its’ party divisions and disagreements. HOWEVER, I WANT TO REMIND OUR CAMPUS that there are more things that can unite us, then divide us; AND this is my mission as your senator. My goal is to unite our campus, on common goals and interests, which can bring hope to this once fragile system and ultimately unite AGGIES by promoting a new definition of SCHOOL SPIRIT AND PRIDE. (For instance, cheaper parking permits by pushing for better summer school incentives, quarterly ASUCD sponsored academic events, and establishing an event planning committee.) I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE that to unite our CAMPUS, to UNITE AGGIES, we must take a practical and realistic approach to serving our campus’s needs. Moreover, being involved in campus as a member of the GREEK community, an intern for Senator Eric Friedman, a commissioner for Internal Affairs Commission, and an INTERN FOR CALPIRG, helped me realize that practical change is the only way we can truly serve our campus and community. GOD BLESS, and VOTE ANDREW KIM FOR ASUCD SENATE.


20071002 00:00:57 nbsp I met Andrew today at IAC, spoke to him later outside the MU.  He is a really nice guy, very passionate, and I hope to see him do well this election. Users/GregWebb

20071112 17:33:15 nbsp I spoke to Andrew about all of his platform issues and though I found him to be pleasant conversation, at least two of his issues seem redundant (and the third is lacking causality). Users/DanXie

20071114 07:28:36 nbsp As an IAC Internal Affairs Commissioner, Andrew Kim decided how to vote on Eric Friedmans reprisal bill by looking at Cem Turhal, who nodded to vote yes.  Such a partisan vote on a frivolous matter doesnt give me confidence in him as a potential Senator. Users/BrentLaabs

20071114 22:32:43 nbsp Andrew  is a really nice guy, very passionate... I agree Greg, but if he cant make an independent decision as a committee member, he should NOT be elected as a ASUCD senator. If ones gonna be in a position of power, they need to be able to think independently. Part of being a leader, of any kind, is making decisions that YOU, not a peer (though if youre representing a constituency, you may want their opinion), feel is the right one.  If Kim is elected, although hes part of GO, hes representing the interests of ALL of the students of UC Davis, not just veteran GO members. Users/MattBlair

20071114 22:52:18 nbsp Matt took the words out of my mouth, I was very disappointed with Andrew yesterday. Users/GregWebb

20071118 13:34:29 nbsp I may agree partially with what you are saying, but that entire room is biased and Laabs you made it into a joke.  Show some respect for the undergrads that sit in that room and dont come back, your air guitar is not a neccessary addition. Users/HSeigenfeld
 Brent Laabs is like the village elder that has all the answers, so yes he should be there  its a public meeting.  He wasnt airguitaring out of disrespect, the room needed that.  We were seeing a bill that was essentially one of where the legislature was acting like the judiciary.  I voted against the bill because of that, not because there was bias in the room.  And I would also say that the bill in question was the joke.  Users/GregWebb

20071118 15:18:12 nbsp Greg Webb you are more of a joke than Brent Laabs, and if Brent Laabs is th village elder we are in an whole world of hurt.  I am a sophmore and find it an amusing to pick apart the weak and emotional displays of the man that is such an inept graduate student that he must spend his time blundering through undergraduate politics.  I have no problem with inviting a qualified member of the graduate student body togive advice and insight, but that person has yet to show up and certainly is not Bent Laabs Users/HSeigenfeld
 Apparently nobody told you that Brent did his undergrad here at Davis and never stopped being involved with ASUCD. It isnt a case of him looking for stuff to do because he was bored with his research. wl
Regardless of what you view, at least Laabs and Webb have made an effort to instill some sort of change on this campus through their ASUCD involvement.  I cant say the same for you Seigenfeld, and further, I was contemplating correcting your typoes, but they prove a point about you in themselves, so I think Ill leave them.  users/Eliyani

20071118 17:32:26 nbsp They may try to change, and I thank you for not incorrectly establishing they have made a positive attempt, for their actions have only had negative results.  Users/HSeigenfeld

Can you assert what you believe to be negative changes?  I like to see some substantiation to claims rendered, though I havent seen any from you so far.  users/Eliyani

Brent Laabs practically singlehandedly rewrote the elections codes, and made amendments to clean up elections following every scandal, and that is in fact positive change except when groups refuse to abide by them. Users/MaxMikalonis MM

20071118 17:55:44 nbsp You may disapprove of Laabs actions H., but he certainly isnt inept. Sure he can come off as brash and uncouth somtimes, but he is far from inept. Inept implies he doesnt do his job. His blundering thorugh undergraduate politics is part of his job as the External Chair of the GSA and the ASUCD Historian, at least his attendance of committee meetings would be. A word like inept would more fittingly apply to the outgoing GO senators who followed through on approximately one campaign promise out of fourteen. Feel free to correct me on that point, I have no problem with admitting a mistake.

I dont know much about Mr. Webbs ASUCD involvement, but I doubt it deserves your tactless ad hominem attack.

Anyhow, I dont see how Laabs actions change the fact that Kim was unqualified to be an ASUCD senator.Users/MattBlair

20071118 18:27:09 nbsp I am confused as to what fourteen promises you are refering to, the reason for this confusion is the statement that they have only accomplished one.

I apologize for my ad hominem attack, but I am tired of misrepresentations in public place.  If anything postings on this and other pages should go through some level of critique and correction before being made ready to the public.

In regards to Andrews decision it did not change anything and as the vote showed it was extremely partisan, on both sides.

So please to anyone reading do not aid in the petty squabble, I would request you only clear up inaccuracies shamelessly related to the public. Users/HSeigenfeld
  As I wrote in the Jesse Rosales comments area, the alternative to having a moderator is increased participation from more of the community. If you truly feel that people such as Users/BrentLaabs and Users/GregWebb are spreading misinformation, then we will need other knowledgeable users on the Davis Wiki to exist and write the factual information (I am not saying these 2 people have done this, but as you can see this can be a subjective decision given multiple opinions). So, since there will be no moderation in the foreseeable future, I would encourage you, and others like you, to continue participating.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

20071118 18:43:23 nbsp Three nonLEAD commissioners, including myself, voted with LEAD on this one.  It wasnt partisan at all, the two GO commissioners voted to support Eric Friedman.  If they had a legitimate reason for their vote they should have brought it up.  The two GO commissioners did not speak during discussion and have not indicated why they voted the way they did.  Its silly partisanship on their part, in my opinion. Users/GregWebb

20071118 19:22:53 nbsp Greg you openly support lead and so do the other members of that room aside from the two GO members. Users/HSeigenfeld
  Regardless of if we support LEAD or not, the people that voted against Friedmans bill gave reasons for doing so.  Bleckman and Kim did not.  GW
         A bad bill is a bad bill. Calling it a partisan attack is a cop out. Users/JimSchwab

20071118 21:13:51 nbsp Please stop commenting on events you were not privy to, no offense, but it being a bad bill is not the question at hand Users/HSeigenfeld
     Then thats your problem, the quality of the bill is what should be debated, not political bickering.  Users/JamesSchwab
     Who is privy to what? I dont get it.  Privy to an IAC meeting?  ph
