Thus the reason that theres a list of trusted editors to manage them.  Although they cant be edited, if theres a really bad mistake, Ive gone in and copied and reposted them with changes.

As for the Real Estate entry, Im hoping that after two weeks or so, the spammers stop trying.  There were just so many, it was pretty clear it was on a list of URLs to vandalize.  Users/JabberWokky
