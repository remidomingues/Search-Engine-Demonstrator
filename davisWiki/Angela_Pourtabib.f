Hailed from the lands of Marin, Angela Pourtabib arrived at UC Davis with high hopes. She became the President of the Davis College Democrats for the 20052006 school year, and was the Executive Director of the DCD until she graduated in Winter 2007.  She cares deeply about strengthening the voice of Democrats on campus and wants to provide an outlet for estranged Democrats who want to perpetuate Democratic ideals and fight for social justice!

For anyone who cares, she also works for Supervisor Mariko Yamada of the 4th District of Yolo County as her Assistant Deputy. Interesting job, you should ask her about it sometime... ;) Oh, and she still is backing Edwards for the Democratic Nom! :)
