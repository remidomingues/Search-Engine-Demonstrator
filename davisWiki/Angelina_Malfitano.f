December 12, 1983  May 30, 2006

Angelina Malfitano was one of the Student Assistants to the Chancellor with her partner in crime, Eric Zamora.  She was short, loud, and always ready for social justice.  She was previously the Community Intern at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center 0405, Chair of the ASUCD Gender and Sexuality Commission 0304, and did random stuff like drumming in the California Aggie Marching BandUh Cal Aggie Marching Banduh! and checking email compulsively. Her motto, TANG! which stands for Take care of yourself, Ask why?, No regrets, and be Genuine, is painted on an upper wall of the LGBTRC LGBT Resource Center.

On Tuesday, May 30th at 9:13am Angelina Malfitano died in a car accident on wiki:wikipedia:State Route 12 (California) Highway 12 near Rio Vista. She is buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, 2200 East 18th street in wiki:wikipedia:Antioch, California Antioch, CA her home town.

There is a http://www.legacy.com/SFGate/GB/GuestbookView.aspx?PersonId17966831 Guest Book set up to leave memories and notes. The UCD Womens Resource and Research Center has a http://wrrc.ucdavis.edu/Angelina_Malfitano/ webpage dedicated to Angelina.

On the second anniversary of her passing, the ASUCD Senate passed a resolution requesting that the ASUCD Conference Room be renamed to the Angelina Malfitano Conference Room.  The request was approved by the Chancellor, and the room where her commission met (sometimes) now bears her name.


In late September 2005 Angelina wrote a short essay entitled Believing in the Power of Your Impact:

 I went on an adventure this summer, to Washington, D.C., where the grownups and politicians play. I was chosen as an organizing fellow for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and I was going to make the most of my experience. I remembered to pack my positive attitude, my smile, my camera, and my bottom line to facilitate growth and change in myself and others.

 Within the first week on the job, I was sent to New York City to take part in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Celebrations. As I marched down the historic streets, hundreds of thousands of strangers smiled back at me as I offered them hope for equality. I handed out stickers to willing strangers, urging them to “Create Change.” Then, in the middle of my jaunt down 5th Avenue, my coworkers started shouting for me. “Hey Angelina, somebody in the crowd is asking for you.” Me? I don’t know anybody in New York City! I have never even left California! Excitedly, I raced around to the opposite side of the parade, and sure enough I found a familiar face in the sea of my beautiful community. I saw my mentor, the student leader who embraced me and showed me how to rise up on campus three years ago. The student who taught me how important it is to fight for gender, sexual, racial, ethnic, class, religious, and any and all other forms of freedom and equality. In that moment, I realized that his guidance is what eventually led me to the New York City Pride Parade on this random day in June. He had influenced me to take risks like going to Washington, D.C., or even to become the Student Assistant to the Chancellor. And here we were, together, experiencing the progress of the community, our lives, and our connection.

 Experiences like these are genuine and reaffirming. They remind me that we are all connected. I believe we all have the capacity to impact each other. Just like the stickers I distributed at the parade, as individuals we must accept the responsibility and the POSSIBILITY to create change. Then, as a community, as UC Davis, as students, the impact is farreaching and tangible. Join me in believing in the power of your impact as a mentor and a teacher and an individual in this world.

20060725 17:33:40 nbsp Angelina was a saint. I believe her biggest miracle happened at her funeral, where, in a Catholic church, an LGBT rainbow flag flew during the ceremony. I have never seen that before and probably never will again, but its testimony to her work in the queer community. Users/JamesSchwab
