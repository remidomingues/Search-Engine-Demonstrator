20101008 12:32:14 nbsp Very thorough dentist.  She doesnt miss a thing.  Had a chip on one of my front bottom tooth fixed (a difficult place to fix a chip) and it looks awsome!  You cant tell anything ever happened.  She also made sure to fix it so that the filling part wouldnt come off if I happen to take a bite of something hard.  I am really pleased with her work.  Highly recomend! Users/sarahbea
