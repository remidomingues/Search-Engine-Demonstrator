Angies Beauty Salon is a fullservice beauty salon and is one of several Hair Salons and Barber Shops in Davis. Hair cuts are $15 for men and $17 and up for women. They do highlights, deep conditions, full color and waxing. Walkins are welcome.

In February of 2006 Angies underwent a significant remodel. The business now occupies the front of the building, in addition to the side it had before. Furthermore, they appear to have more windows, new floors, new paint— it looks drastically better. Dare I say, like a real salon.

In 2010, Silvia, Anamaria, and Mela, who had been stylists at Angies Beauty Salon, opened up their own salon  Expressions Hair Design.

20060302 17:07:54 nbsp I loved the haircut I got here! Do not be fooled by its ooutward appearence these people are REALLY REALLY great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Users/JenniferDhaliwal

20060305 13:36:08 nbsp I had a great experience here. Its a very casual atmosphere, but they do a great job. Id suggest bringing photos or pictures of what youd like to have done, and you cant beat the prices. They also take walkins regularly. Users/KatieBauer

20060417 21:31:34 nbsp I love Angies all of the girls are wonderful and the remodel looks great. Users/JackieCaro

20060627 15:08:05 nbsp After having my haircut ruined at another salon in another state, I decided to go for a cheap haircut in case they couldnt fix it I wouldnt be out too much.  Angies did a great job, I dont know her name but the owner did my hair and it looked great, she worked with the messed up layers and it ended up looking exactly how I had explained it.  She was kind of hard to understand with her hispanic accent, but she knows what she doing and she definitely could get away with charging more for how talented she is. Users/HillaryLaFever

20060805 22:23:53 nbsp I got a fabulous haircut here. I decided to go for a new look and it went here based on the great reviews and the stylist did what I wanted and she told me how to maintain my style. I highly recommend this place. Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060810 13:29:08 nbsp I just got a haircut there and it was the WORST haircut experience I have ever had!  They didnt wash my hair, which was surprising, but not a big deal if the haircut had turned out good.  Then the woman cutting my hair kept talking to her coworker the entire time  I felt like I had to remind her that I was there so she wouldnt forget what she was doing!  All I wanted was for the layers in my hair to be evened out a little, but she made them so much worse, now I have one extremely short layer and one extremely long layer.  I definitely will not go back.   Users/DieterZamboni

20060818 14:58:08 nbsp After moving to Davis I consulted daviswiki for a salon when my hair started to look a little bushy. I usually pay $55 a cut and it takes my stylist like 2 hours to cut my freakin hair. I went down to Angies (30 minutes notice for an appointment) and got a wonderful cut for $13! Sweet! Users/JackeryRoehrig

20060914 15:56:55 nbsp I like this place! They charge very little for good hair cuts. Everyone was very friendly and they didnt require a hairwashing. Users/RathyMarie

20060920 14:01:27 nbsp I was looking for a decent priced hair salon and gave Angies a try. I only paid 90$ got three different hair colors put in and a cut. This is the best price I have ever had for the quality of work she did. Angie was fast and efficient, I was very pleased. It was also fun to listen to all the Espanol.  Users/SonjaSchaff

20070115 21:20:40 nbsp I went in today to cut off 10 of hair for Locks of Love. The woman (Angie, I believe), was amazing. She knew exactly what I wanted and the cut was PERFECT. She knew exactly how to make my hair do exactly what I wanted it to! You might want to make an appointment, though. Also, haircuts are now $14 and up. Mine cost $16 for a shoulderlength cut with some layering. Users/MeganCleary

20070308 15:35:58 nbsp I went in today to layer my hair and it turned out perfect! The lady didnt talk much but I like that she was just concentrating on my hair. For just the layers it cost me $16. Users/NicoleBush

20070402 22:53:37 nbsp Angie’s was recently joined by another great profesional stylist, Mela. She has been cutting my hair for the last seven years. I know her since she used to work at We Care Hair, and let me tell you every time I think I can trust my hair to someone else I always go back to her so she can fix it.  Users/CarlosAlvarado

20070418 18:26:45 nbsp Cut/Color. The staff was exceptional the best experience out of many salon I have been to. Everyone was extremely friendly and I absolutely love my hair! Users/MeagnOwens

20070504 15:53:59 nbsp I went to Angies today just to have the dead ends trimmed off (there were a lot in many layers) and she did a fantastic job! I am trying to grow out my layers, all of which had dead ends and she got rid of them all. And the price: $16! Well, its hard to beat the service for the price! Users/AmberMacdonald

20070504 15:54:18 nbsp Oh, and Angie was my stylist. Users/AmberMacdonald

20070601 22:28:25 nbsp I really enjoy the atmosphere I got my hair cut they dry and style it too Anamarie I think she is the owner was my stylist I really like my cut the price great  I recomend Anamarie. Users/teresa

20070609 12:12:25 nbsp I went a couple of years ago and had a good experience.  I went again today, and it was great.  I didnt even have an appointment, but I didnt have to wait at all, and my hair looks cute. Users/KateBaker

20070803 15:13:08 nbsp I read all the rave reviews, so I popped over to try out Angies for myself. I dont know who my stylist was, but I didnt like my experience. My stylist kept dropping the combs and spilled something all over at one point and had to stop to clean it up. Also, she did the one thing that annoys me the most: she parted my hair in the middle to cut it. Now it looks odd when I return it to its natural part on the side. Yes, it was inexpensive at $16, but I was not impressed with the service, nor am I happy with my cut.  Users/LauraKaroly

20070907 01:30:18 nbsp EXCELLENT HAIR CUTS!!!!i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.Everyone do a great job and is only $14.00 dollars for mens all the girls are very nice . Users/thomasdimer

20071004 22:40:14 nbsp Very happy with all the hair dresses everyone there is really nice. Great hair cuts and fantastic sense of humor. A guys is only $14.00 dollars for hair cuts. Users/davidchang

20071118 17:10:04 nbsp I had a wonderful expeience at Angies salon . If youre a guy came to this salon.Walkins are welcome and Ive never waited long time Users/Franktovar

20071219 01:56:43 nbsp I went on a Monday around 1pm and it was busy. I had to wait an hour. Majority of the clientele (at least at the time I went) were older women getting their hair dyed or whatever. Although the person who worked on me was friendly, I did not like my hair cut. At first, my hair was cut unevenly, and after I had told her what to do to fix it, results were still bad. I would have been better off cutting it myself. Do what another person had suggested above, and bring in a picture for them to see. Otherwise, dont expect them to create something that would look good on you. Users/at86

20080131 11:30:20 nbsp Atmosphere was very relaxed.  The haircut was decent, a little choppy.  After reading all the great comments, I was expecting more.  It felt like I had to guide my stylist and tell her exactly what to do.  Decent experience, nothing worth raving about.  Probably wont go back.     Users/JennaChen

20080430 10:51:46 nbsp Great haircut for only 16 bucks! :) I had Sylvia do mine and it came out really, really well. Ive never been there for hair dye jobs but a friend of mine has aka SonjaSchaff and her hairs always cute. Users/simplyg00d

20080716 23:51:47 nbsp I had a great hair cut this is my 2th time Anamaria cut my hair and I loved .I really recommend you .If you dont like to wait you can make and appointment too. Users/marissacampos

20081010 17:14:00 nbsp I had my hair cut by Sylvia my first time. She isnt really good at layering my hair and she doesnt know how to cut side bangs. It was presentable but nothing great. My roommate got her haircut by Angie and it looked really good on her. So I went to Angie the second time. Angie asked me who cut my hair before because the layers were uneven but I didnt tell her it was Sylvia. Go to Angie if youre looking for a better haircut... but I wont come back here again. I think Connie from Kosmos is significantly better at cutting modern hair.  Users/PSL

20081023 21:21:43 nbsp I just got a great cut like always. Everybody is fantastic I like this place they are very professionals.I highly recommend this place.    Users/trinni

20081024 21:28:11 nbsp AMAZING

I moved to Davis from SF to attend UCD about 3years ago. For the first few months I was here, I traveled back to SF just to get my hair done. (If youre looking for someone in SF, email me... I know JUST the right girl!). But that got expensive. So I decided to go to Angies because of the good reviews it got, and was recommended by a friend.

I have been going to Angies for over 3 years now, and I never want to go anywhere else. I found the perfect place for me that can handle my college budget!

I have to tell all of you that it truly is a GREAT place! It is a very friendly and relaxing environment. They make you feel at home the second you walk in the door, and the quality of the service is tremendous. whether its a hair cut or coloring, you always come out looking fabulous. thats true with all of the stylists. i have had my hair cut by at least 3 of the stylists, and i have never disliked how it was cut. they are very good about talking with you first and discussing what you want. even as they are cutting, they check to make sure it is to your liking and are willing to make any changes. and when youre done, everyone compliments you on how great you look. granted, im sure thats part of promoting the biz, but they are always very genuine about it. the pricing is VERY reasonable. overall, this place is a very fun and comfortable environment. Trust me if you go you will always be in good hands.

20090202 19:37:38 nbsp just went today. got my hair cut by Mela. Shes very nice and very gentle with my hair. She concentrated on the style I wanted and discussed lengths of shortness with me. I recommend this place for affordable and comfort. I had long hair and chopped into something short and simple with bangs. all for $17. plus, Im glad they take walk in. I just walked in and got my haircut :) Users/ChiYang

20090214 16:20:35 nbsp My friend and I were looking for inexpensive haircuts in Davis. We were able to walk right in and be seen immediately, which is not what Im used to (I usually make appointments). The place is kinda small and looks like a house, which was offsetting until we peeked into the window and saw that all the stylists had cute hair (which is how I judge the quality of salons). Usually I have trouble finding a decent stylist because I am a woman who prefers very short spiky hair, which is hard to do correctly (you need a razor, etc) and Im used to paying $30+ for good cuts. The woman who cut my hair here did just as good a job as any expensive place, and for $15 (she gave me a $2 discount for having short hair). I was very impressed. I picked out a picture and she helped me customize it to what I wanted my hair to look like, and it was exactly what I wanted. I will definitely go back. Dont be turned off by it looking small, by people looking like they arent busy, or by the fact that everyone in there speaks Spanish constantly (though I speak a little bit of Spanish, so for me it felt homey). Im very pleased to have found a good stylist on a college student budget. Oh, and my friend loves her haircut too. Users/philoinferno

20090217 22:27:24 nbsp update I actually wont be back to this location, my haircut grew out very quickly last time due to the poor cutting and their prices keep rising. Users/simplyg00d

20090227 22:54:11 nbsp I love my hair cut just what I want!and only $17 dollars. Users/tomasa

20090427 15:39:31 nbsp Just went two days ago. I got somebody to cut my hair right when I walked in.. The lady did a nice job. Not too talkative (so not distracting herself), yet very careful to follow directions and always ask before doing something drastic. Im Korean and used to go to Korean hair salons in LA, but there were non in Davis.. I went to New Fashion Salon a few months ago and the cut was okay (not too bad) but they really gave me TOO MUCH layers, my hair was messy! But now, I got rid of all my layers at Angies. I love it! At New Fashion, I specifically asked for little layers but she gave me so much, so Angies was heaven for me! I highly recommend here. They follow directions well and its so cheap! Only $17 for a haircut!  Users/YuJinChoi

20090430 22:09:10 nbsp What I can said I love my hair cut and I pay only $17 dollars new style new look soooo great. Users/anny

20090526 02:18:18 nbsp AMAZING the best haircut I have ever had. The ladies are super nice and not only is it a great cut but it feels like you are only in there for a few minutes.  Users/ddavis

20090608 02:28:28 nbsp A friend recommended this place, and I went due to the cheap pricing. The salon looks nice and homely inside, the stylists spoke spanish the entire time. They werent the friendliest, but whatever. The haircut was EXTREMELY quick  I asked for layers, and I barely saw any. I wont be going back here, ever again. Users/shopaholic

20090612 11:15:28 nbsp I have gone to Angies several times in that past and was satisfied with my hair cut for the price I paid. Recently I went in without an appointment and Slyvia cut my hair.  I had a picture of what I wanted (which was a long bob with side swept bangs) and when she finished, I ended up looking like Kate from Jon & Kate + 8. Not what I wanted.  Short of that, it didnt look good or even. I had to fix it myself with scissors at home. I should have asked for my money back.  Angie is much better.  I highly recommend her. Avoid Sylvia.  She seems unhappy like she doesnt like her job and maybe needs to move on to another career. Users/JenniferGreen

20090824 21:21:42 nbsp The place got remodeled a couple of years ago and it looks great. They always make you feel welcomed even without an appointment and try to fit you in their tight schedule. They are really nice and ususally talk among each other wich makes you think they enjoy being there. I can not believe how low are the prices. I have long curly hair and use three tones of color which takes close to three hours to do. It always takes me a week ahead appointment and close to $300 at other salons and they did it here for $100 the moment I walked in. The results were identical to other expensive salons. I highly recommend this place. I also witnessed a very annoying and moody girl doing her hair there for her brothers wedding and Sylvia was extremely nice, and accomodating, making all the changes she requested. The girl brought a picture and decided during the service that she wanted to do several changes from the original picture. The girl looked really happy at the end, and I could not believe how much time, effort, and patience Sylvia put into making her happy for the very low price they charged her.  Users/Maga

20090926 16:32:32 nbsp Angie is a professional. My hair are thick and curly and many hair salons dont know how to cut this type of hair. Angie cut them so fast(25 minutes I was out)and she did exactly what I wanted + she straighten them and its only for 17$. She is the best hair stylist I have experienced in US so far. Thank you Angie! Users/Adelina

20091028 20:50:38 nbsp My husband was a customer there and was very dissatisfied,  He answered his cell phone when I called him for a medical emergency and was charged $5.  The owner was rude and obnoxious.  Not a great cut either. Buyer beware. Users/kbowen100


20100109 15:12:12 nbsp I saw this place across the street when I was at the CoOp and decided to try it out, especially seeing that they only charge $15 for a haircut! I made an appointment for the next day and was very satisfied with the service. They were ready for me when I got there and the haircut took only 15 minutes. Ive got long curly hair and they styled it really well, especially given the price and amount of time it took. I guess for womens cuts it must be $17, because thats what my final price was but hey, thats pretty great! Ill definitely be going back from here on out. Users/mlesblues

20100314 16:55:30 nbsp I went there a while back and took in a picture that came from one of those hair magazine (that even had instructions attach to it with what to ask for).  I showed the pic to Anamaria b/c she was the one doing my hair and restated the specifics from the magazine cutout.  She glanced at it for a second then set it down, never looking at it again, and gave me a completely different cut that was choppy and uneven.  Sure their prices are cheap, but you get what you pay for...cheap and crappy service.  Im better off getting my hair cut for free at those beauty school, at lease they do an accurate job in following instructions and requests. Not surprise theyre closing, well see how their new business do if the service stays the same. Users/kikao

20100315 21:59:01 nbsp I highly recommend this place i like all the girls everyone thats my hair for years and i always happy and all the times i changes my style . Users/Estelamantoya

20100326 11:20:58 nbsp The worst haircut Ive ever had!! I have thick, long straight hair and I asked my stylist  Angie  to put some layers in so that it didnt look too flat and straight. I even brought a photo of what I wanted my hair to look like. Should have been a simple, pretty generic layered cut. She proceeded to razor cut layers that started up by my ears and left the bottom of my hair super thin and straggly. I literally cried when I got home and looked at my hair. It took months to grow out and look seminormal. Also, during the cut she talked to her coworker/friend the whole time and pretty much ignored me until the end. Users/AmyLeigh

20100420 08:30:31 nbsp I just got my hair cut yesterday Fabulous
I got exactly what I asked for and my hair looks great!
I had got to anthor place last week and they did a horrible job, but Anamaria I belive was her name fixed it! I was soooo relieved! The place was kid of small but I guess who cares when your hair comes out looking GREAT!

I will be returning!  Users/JessicaMorgan

20100427 16:33:56 nbsp I have long hair and I got my hair cut here recently.  Angie is nice, shop is great, prices are great, but unfortunately, one of the stylists cut my hair too short.  This is the second time this has happened in Davis, Im just posting this so people see that no shop is perfect. Users/Darkfallin

20100505 17:14:44 nbsp Ive been here 3 times. The first 2 times I brought in a picture and explained how I wanted my hair done. I dont remember who did my hair, but she only got the basic shape of the hairstyle from the picture, and not much else. I went again today without a picture, and explicitly said several times that I wanted sideswept bangs. She didnt seem to know what those were and didnt quite cut my bangs the way I wanted. Thankfully, they still turned out okay when I went back home to adjust and style them myself.

In short, go here because theyre friendly and cheap, but not if youre looking for a new style. Users/AlishaTran

20100516 04:36:34 nbsp Ive been here about 5 times total, maybe 4, but out of those times I had 3 bad haircuts and with 3 different ladies. Theyre great and friendly, but dont really talk to you and instead to each other. In Spanish. Ive brought in pictures and one picture had a bunch of layers. The woman removed all of my layers and I ended up with a straight, boring haircut. I looked like Donna from That 70s Show. Not fun. I ended up going elsewhere to get it fixed. Users/HannahFolkes

20100808 14:17:56 nbsp Angie is amazing! I have had my hair cut multiple times here. I bring in a picture and she does it really quick and straightens my hair after for only $17. I used to pay over $60 for the same cut at pure beauty. Angie is wonderful and I will keep going to this place after I leave Davis.  Users/serafina

20110216 My husband and I have been going to this salon for 10 years. Angie is a very good hair dresser and her prices are fair. The salon in not stuffy but very welcoming. Users/LuzCamacho
