20100808 14:17:56 nbsp Angie is amazing! I have had my hair cut multiple times here. I bring in a picture and she does it really quick and straightens my hair after for only $17. I used to pay over $60 for the same cut at pure beauty. Angie is wonderful and I will keep going to this place after I leave Davis.  Users/serafina

20100812 01:36:56 nbsp I dont know about the new management, But I went in January/Feburary of 2010 and it was the worst haircut I have ever received. A straight forward bob. I even let her choose the length. Not only did she not wash my hair, she bluntly cut my hair and left me with chunky layers and uneven bangs. I didnt ask her to fix it. I paid her and went straight to another salon. Users/HonestJane

20100824 22:39:00 nbsp Serafina is totally right... when she states that Angie is amazing! Im one of these people that likes changing their look all the time, from coloring to highlights; longer hair to shorter, sometimes different color extensions and different style cuts. And everytime Angie just understands what I want. and like every good stylist Angie gives me feed back on what products best suits my hair to have healthy hair.  Users/ElizabethL

20100824 22:40:52 nbsp Also wanted to add, that if you havent been there since May; the place looks totally different from the inside!  Users/ElizabethL

20100910 11:29:40 nbsp I have been going to Angie for 3 years now and absolutely love her! She is very fast, inexpensive, and does great highlights and cuts. My boyfriend also goes to her and says she is the best! I worked in a salon in san diego for 5 years so I am very picky when it comes to hairstylists....I highly recommend angie! Users/dpvballr

20101016 17:42:35 nbsp It was not that great......My hair was cut way too short, much more than what I asked for and she didnt even try to talk to me. But the worst part is that it only took her 5mins to do it too. It was cheap for a reason, I think Im going back to the other hair salons in Davis.   Users/JoJoBells

20101107 22:24:55 nbsp Not worth it (at least for girls). Nuff said.
DONT GO THERE. Users/EunahOh

20110716 01:54:15 nbsp There are a lot of elitist salons in Davis. Maybe some of these women went to other salons where they were soothed with wine and pricey lists of services, and they left feeling a bit numb and very flattered, and I think that can be fun too! I like Angie because her salon is clean, she always looks impeccable, she always treats me with respect (never talks about the other salons in davis, never asks questions), gives me a great haircut, and only charges me 17 dollars. Worthy of a 20 percent tip! I forgot to mention, she is always smiling, and her salon is ALWAYS busy! Also, if you want a good haircut, do a little homework about what style is best for you before you head for the stylist; then you always will be (mostly!) in control of your haircuts destiny! Its not like youre bound and gagged, sister!:) Users/MT

20111209 08:45:15 nbsp Im getting loads of compliments on my latest hair cut at Angies. For $17 plus tip, Ive gotten a really fantastic cut. Its hard for a lot of people to give up their expensive hair cuts and try something cheaper, but Angie is miles above Supercuts. She talked with me about how my last (very expensive) hair cut wasnt working for me and did a great job of fixing it and still giving it some edge. Loved the straightening at the end, too! Thats actually something I can replicate at home, rather than the admittedly awesome but impossible to duplicate blowout and style I receive after a more expensive cut and shampoo.
Angie and her family are also incredibly sweet people and make you feel right at home. Im so glad I took the plunge! Ill definitely be back. Users/LilyS

  20120411 Just took the plunge and got highlights here, too. Best money I ever spent on my hair! For $80 Angie did partial (but really closer to full) highlights, toner, and a trim. Great product, and the color turned out amazing because she really took the time to make sure she knew exactly what I wanted. Im hooked! Users/LilyS

20120730 17:43:16 nbsp I showed her a picture that was about a year old of myself and asked to get bangs just like the picture and a trim for the rest. She barely glanced at the photo before cutting my hair.  She finished in 5 minutes but it wasnt what I asked for. She keeps saying its just like the picture but it was completely different, in length and type of bangs.  While she was cutting and drying my hair, she was very rough when she brushed it and could feel the hairs being pulled out of my scalp.  She burned my ear while straightening, and still cutting even after she said she was done and had put me in the styling station.  The end results were nice, but not what I asked for. If you dont know exactly what you want, then she would be an adequate hair stylist to see.  Users/Angelaarpaia
