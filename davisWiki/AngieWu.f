20120224 17:42:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  I formatted your email address using the wikis funky little email macro.  It creates a clickable display on screen so its easy for people to email you, but it doesnt show up as an email address in searches, so bots and whatnot shouldnt be able to pick up on it and spam you.  The formats a little odd: {{{Mailto(name AT domain DOT com)}}} comes out as Mailto(name AT domain DOT com). Users/TomGarberson
