This creation has been there for several months already, though it seems to be in less repair recently.

I saw a sleepy stray calico Cats cat curled up inside the walls of the temple complex today! It was awfully cute. Spooked and ran away before I could get a picture though.  Users/BarnabasTruman

I happened to be in this area of campus yesterday (November 5, 2010) and the ruins are still there! Most of the earthworks have long since washed away in the rain, but the skeletal framework of twigs and planks yet stand. Users/BarnabasTruman
