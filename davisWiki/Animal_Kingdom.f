Animal Kingdom offered supplies for small critters, fish, birds, dogs & cats, including premium foods and a section of bulk foods & treats. If you could not find a specific product for your pet, they could special order items for customers at no extra cost.

Specializing in birds, Animal Kingdom also sold a wide variety of pets including snakes, lizards, turtles and chameleons, dumbo and fancy rats, English mice, hamsters, rabbits, and chinchillas. The store also sold feeder rats & mice, crickets, mealworms, waxworms, and super worms for your reptiles needs.

In 2005, a kitten rescue program was initiated at the store, and kittens could be adopted for $99 (this includes vet fees for spay/neuter, immunizations, and deworming).

If youre looking for a dog, see Dogs for a listing of dog resources.

They had a dogbathing station you can rent to doityourself for a dog bath.  Nice to have a place where you can get warm water, shampoo, towels, dryer, etc to groom your dogpal in cold weather!



Great selection of crickets and mealworms.  Good prices on them too.  I dont recommend the rats for live feeding of snakes though, the ones found at other pet stores (ie. Petco) are much more docile.  Both times that I bought one from Animal Kingdom the rats bit our snake.  Even for rats as pets though, they are too fiesty, probably because they breed them themselves.  Users/JenniferLaFever

This place and Pet Cetera are the only 2 places in Davis that sells live fish food. (tubifex and daphnia) It is a little bit pricier than petco but they offer more variety of fish.

20060220 17:32:09 nbsp I went in to ask about filters for a small tank, and they sold me a small pumphead, saying it was a filter.  Also my fault, as I should have checked and not just trusted.  But they took it back fine, a different person said sorry, and they all were very kind and polite.  I liked this place.   Users/EdWins ES

20060329 10:54:39 nbsp They have Canidae! And other natural/organic pet food choices. Users/LaurenMcNees

20060513 15:20:55 nbsp I went in here to inquire about getting another reptile, and the selection was very small.  However, I starting thinking about rats and the cashier was very knowledgable and friendly.  Also, the carry Solid Gold pet food, the BEST in holistic food. Users/AllisonEriksen

20060605 18:57:22 nbsp they sell oxbow products! also, their cavy cuisine (guinea pig food) is cheaper than the oxbow websites if you get it by the pound from the bins.  the only problem i have with this place is that often there are two dogs (an employees?) fighting in the aisles and leaping about with their teeth bared, and since it is a very cramped store i think that amounts to some sort of risk for customers. first time i went in there one rushed me and started barking furiously. i almost had a heart attack!

20061109 19:10:28 nbsp It sucked. Users/MirandaClemings

20061212 00:55:34 nbsp They carry the best quality pet food so that is why I go there But MAN do I wish they would clean up that darn store! I know it is a pet store, but come on does it HAVE to stink to holy heaven???  Users/NoelWasicki

20070302 19:05:06 nbsp Hehe, one of the dogs walked over, picked himself out a treat, and followed us around the store, it was cute.  Its a bit messy, but they have a couple cool small animal products I havent really seen elsewhere.  Users/EdWins ES

20070523 22:40:16 nbsp Today when I was in they had a petition on their sales counter claiming that their landlord was terminating their lease because they were a pet store, and seeking public support. I signed, and hope AK can stick around. This seems really odd, though: why not just raise the rent, instead of terminating the lease? Anyone have any more info? Users/MattCzarnowski

20070622 13:15:04 nbsp They are so friendly!  Theyre willing to order pet food for you if they dont have any currently in stock and without any extra cost.  Plus, they sometimes have a pet dog there who wanders around with you as you explore the store.  I agree though, that it usually smells pretty bad. Users/LihuaLu

20070721 19:42:59 nbsp do you know if they do fish exchanges? Users/VietNguyen

20070724 12:36:31 nbsp Animal Kingdom is gone, and they cant find a suitable place to relocate to.  Which means (aside from aquatic pets) the only place in within city limits to get pets and supplies is Petco.  Yay, Davis! Users/LeightonHinkley

Not quite true (but the trend certainly is towards fewer pet stores), Ace does sell rodents and rabbits.  Users/JimEvans

20070731 19:54:58 nbsp Sadly they are closing...they initially were moving, but alas they are no more...I went by today (7/31/07)and they had a few rats and an empty cage or two for sale. Users/CStevens

20070807 14:42:48 nbsp I just want to second the recommendation for Ace. They now seem to carry the Oxbow line of pet products. If everyone who was going to AK starts shopping there, maybe we can request and get all the products they dont currently carry. Users/MattCzarnowski

20070807 16:06:07 nbsp Teriyaki Express and Animal Kingdom both gone.  Davis is slouching towards mediocrity one greedy landlord at a time. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20080202 10:55:56 nbsp well. my mom was jennifer, the rat/groomer lady. and if you were one of those people who got rung up by a little girl. that little girl was me. and those two dogs were my moms and her best friends. so i apologize. recently i went to petco and saw rats that were DYING! they couldnt breathe, and theyre cages were filthy. yess, we bred our own rats and they are very good quality. unlike petco, we actually took care of our animals. but after about 2005 i admit the place started to go downhill. because my family moved and animal kingdom only had one owner to run it. so you cant really blame them. and comparing animal kingdom to petco is a major insult. we had about every brand of pet food that you could ever think of. and from most of these comments, most of you looked very pleased.

and yes we did have a petition. i was there visiting and i couldnt believe the shape that the store was in. i signed it. and the thing is..the landlord was racist. he had a thing against asian people. and video city closed also. i think..and that was ran by my best friends parents. and they were asian. and the sears, had lots of asians, and they kept on getting fired. and they couldnt raise the rent because thats what theyve been doing all these years.

before my mom and her best friend bought the store..the owner was incredibly stupid.
he kept on getting suid and the place was TERRIBLY filthy. im sorry, but we made animal kingdom 10x better.

and complain about the hygene more. let me see you clean up a after about 100 animals everynight!
would you rather have it stink, or have animals that die the next day. thats what i thought.
and dont say, they shouldve hired more employees.
well, the employees didnt know how to take care of animals!

so complain more people, and i will give you an explaination to everything because seriously people,
you dont know what goes on behind that counter.

P.S the dogs were our pets that were trained to be guard dogs. Users/lissayermom
