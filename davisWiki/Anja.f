I grew up in Davis, and am currently going to Columbia College in South Carolina for a B.A. in dance education with certification. Im still very much a Davisite at heart, though!

Dancing Dance and music have been my passions from a very early age, so most everything I do ties into those in some way or another. Im mostly a homebody, so youre not likely to see me out and about or at any sort of nightlife scene. Yes, I live under a rock, and Im darn proud of it, too! Ive done my fair share of traveling, culminating in a year abroad in Ireland with visits to several other European countries. Aside from the performing arts, I really enjoy curling up with a book or a movie, or fooling around online. I have quite eclectic tastes when it comes to all of my hobbies and interests, and I like to try to keep an open mind to new perspectives on them.

My interests include, but are not limited to (and in no particular order):

Dance  ballet, tap, bellydance, modern, jazz, musical theater, ballroom, hip hop, lyrical, Irish
Music  baroque, classical, Broadway, pop, R&B, easy listening, new age, rock, celtic, world, middle eastern, vocal, jazz
Books  fantasy, nonfiction, historical fiction, biographies, beauty, history, poetry, crafts, modern fiction, scifi, thriller/mystery, romance
Movies  just about everything. Theres very few movies Ive seen so far that I dislike
Food  Im a rather picky eater, and my tastes tend to lean towards the simple. Not a huge veggie fan, but Im getting better.
