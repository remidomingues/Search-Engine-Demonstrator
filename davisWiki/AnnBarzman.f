Hi my name is Ann Barzman and I am a student at UC Davis. Currently I am part of the Davis Dollars team helping with Business Planning and Community Outreach.


20110915 12:41:40 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for editing under your real name and adding info to the wiki.  Im a little concerned by the linking of Davis Dollars on the pages for all of the businesses that accept them.  It seems a bit promotional to me.  On the other hand, its relevant information.  Is DD a nonprofit?  The Wiki is pretty heavily restricted in being used promotionally by its agreement with the IRS.  That said, I do appreciate that youve added links in a way that isnt aggressively promotional or anything like that!  I started a talk page on the issue over at Davis Dollars/Talkmaybe you could add a little info there? Users/TomGarberson
