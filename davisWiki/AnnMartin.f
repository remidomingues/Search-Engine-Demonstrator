20130409 18:44:22 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Welcome to the Wiki, Ann! About the Yelp comments we usually dont like the entire comment posted here. The better way (in my opinion) is to just post the links on the page instead and people can read it their on their own. :) Users/PeteB

20130409 18:50:12 nbsp AnnI removed the text of the Yelp reviews from your page and linked them in the headers instead Users/PeteB

20130410 13:17:05 nbsp AnnIm sorry but due to the size of the article we cant make it bigger as itll take up the entire page Users/PeteB
 Actually I think the problem might be in the original file.  The properties show it as a 181x166 pixel image.  If you can upload a larger copy, that may solve the problem.  JT
