Then describe the Wiki Animals animal here!

Some ideas: What do you like best about your pet? What do you not like? How old is it in human years? What is the funniest/strangest/most remarkable thing it has done? Would you recommend this breed to others? Whats involved in caring for this type of animal (does it have to be walked, milked, sheared)? What costs (food, vaccinations, etc.)? Are there restrictions on where/who can own it? Who should not get this type of pet? Is it childfriendly? Furniturefriendly?
