20090804 15:50:23 nbsp I had a full body massage on 8.3.09.  The environment was very relaxing and Ann employed excellent massage techniques.  She communicates well and made sure I was receiving the most out of the massage therapy session.  I am a competitive cyclist and look forward to seeing how massage therapy can add to my cycling career.  I will definitely incorporate massage therapy into my schedule. Users/MicheleFeikert

20090804 22:00:21 nbsp My massage with Ann was amazing!  Ann is very professional, we first had a thorough checkin conversation covering my expectations and my specific needs/condition, then followed a great massage.  Ann applies the perfect amount of pressure: its there when you need it, and its subtle when you want it to be so, all thanks to the right amount of communication through the massage.  I am dealing with pelvis/hips problems affecting my knee and my cycling and running.  Anns massage helped me loosen up and my knee felt much better afterward.  Looking forward to a regular massage from Ann. Users/SandrineJ

20120112 15:22:46 nbsp Ann is a fantastic massage therapist. Her extensive knowledge of human anatomy, along with her intuition allows her to work on all the right knots. Her technique is highly effective, ranging from gentle to deep pressure. I appreciate her series package of 3 massages, truly an awesome value. I highly recommend Ann!

20120403 10:18:04 nbsp Ann gave me an excellent massage. She was responsive, observant, and communicative the whole time, so that the massage was continually tailored towards my tastes and my needs. My needs, in this case, was relief from some serious knots and aches Id racked up at my computer. Anns massage relaxed me, worked out most of my tension, and reset me after a week of hard work. I came in barely wanting to sit up, and I left feeling like a million bucks! I visited her at Gerner Chiropractic, and the environment was energetic, fun, and welcoming. Ill definitely go back.

20130930 13:17:57 nbsp I got a massage from Ann after running a marathon. She was very communicative, making sure I was getting the treatment I wanted. I preferred to be mashed pretty hard and Ann was strong enough to do it. We also discussed the effects running was having on my system and how to keep healthy.  Users/ScottB
