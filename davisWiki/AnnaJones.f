Annas Haiku Reviews of Nugget Desserts

Key Lime Cheesecake

While it sounds yummy,
Its gummy and way too sweet.
A disappointment.

Fudge Brownie

There has never been
A more delicious brownie.
Way hard to resist.

Pumpkin Bar

I am sad this is
Only around in the fall,
But its worth the wait.

Chocolate Eclair

I think this one is
Pretty decent, but nothing
To write home about

Macaroons

I never even
Knew I liked macaroons but
It seems I do. Yep.
