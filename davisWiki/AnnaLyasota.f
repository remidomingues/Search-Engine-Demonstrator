20080916 17:35:22 nbsp I copied the note you left on Users/NotSure NotSures user page over to Floor Store of Davis so others could see that you responded; I also want to say thanks for getting involved on DavisWiki and for listening to feedback and learning about how to interact with the wiki community. I know it can be frustrating dealing with negative and possibly false reviews, but hopefully this situation will be worked out in a timely fashion. Negative reviews wont have as much of an effect if the business gets involved in a positive way.  Users/ElleWeber
