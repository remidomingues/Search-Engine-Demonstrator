My Name is Dina Connor and I am one of the owners of the Laundry Lounge.  Our customers satisfaction is VERY important to us!  We DO in fact have hot water.  When we took over, there were a lot of machine maintenance issues to be dealt with.  If you find that a machines water is not hot enough, PLEASE come and tell us!  We can see if there is a clog in the hot water line or if the machines temperature controls need to be adjusted.  We can also provide you with a free wash (or washes) if things are not up to par.  I invite you to come back for a free wash on us.  I will leave a coupon with your name on it, up front, just ask myself, Max the other owner, or our staff for it the next time you come in!  Feel free to grab my business card and contact me anytime!
Thanks! Users/dina2901
