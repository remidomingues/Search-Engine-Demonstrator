Anonymous HIV testing means your identity is unknown. Unlike Confidential HIV Testing, anonymous testing does not associate a persons name with the test or the test results.  Instead, you use a pseudonym or a code number to retrieve your results.  The sample taken for anonymous testing can be from a finger prick for blood or an oral swab that the patient does on him or herself.
