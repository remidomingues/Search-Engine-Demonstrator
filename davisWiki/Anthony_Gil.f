 Candidate Statement 

Hey Aggies!

My name ANTHONY GIL and I running with the NOW Slate to be your next ASUCD Senator. I am a second year Computer Science and Communications doublemajor from San Jose, CA. I have been involved in ASUCD since my first year and currently hold the position as Intern to the ASUCD President Carly Sandstrom.

My goal while in office is to make sure all student have a voice and are heard by their student government.  I am extremely passionate about advocating on behalf of all students to our Association and university and I am excited to do so. If elected, I seek to accomplish the following platforms:

INSTALL MORE HYDRATION STATIONS
Many students possess a reusable water bottle, however, there is a serious shortage of hydration stations on campus where those bottles can be refilled. I plan to install more hydration stations in areas such as _ and continue to improve access to tap water on campus. Both of these initiatives would support the use of reusable drinking containers and reduces the purchase and disposal of singleuse plastic water bottles. This would provide support to our campus goals to reduce waste, improve tap water accessibility, and foster a sustainable culture.  In addition, I plan to work with campus departments and administration to institutionalize future bottle refill stations as part of any new construction projects.

IMPROVE ASUCD MOBILE APP
The future of our campus is in the age of technology and its what is going to drive us forward in keeping us connected as ONE campus. Most students are unaware of the ASUCD mobile application and many are unsatisfied with it. The app has significant potential and I seek to grow it to its fullest. For example, I want to include a list a student organizations as well as their contact information in order provide students with easier access to stay involved.

Remember to vote ANTHONY GIL #1 and NOW #26 for ASUCD Senate and WONDERS/GHAI for ASUCD President and Vice President on February 18  21 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
