Stillers Antique Bizzare was a bars bar and grill in Hotel Aggie in business from around Davis Timeline/1960 1968 until the early Davis Timeline/1980 1980s,  replacing Debos Pizza, and in turn replaced by La Esperanza.  It had great food, especially Bobbys Chilli, a BIG basket of fries, onion rings, big bar burgers, and pizza.  It was also quite dark, with candles in wine bottles on long, heavy tables, with benches. As the name suggests, the place was decorated with curiosities of olden times.

Renes picture hung behind the bar.

Founded by Don Frank, later owned by Milt & Jane Eberle, who owned the hotel.

They hosted lots of music, including: The Family Tree (Law School), Scott van Ling, The Vet School Band. Robert Crumb R. (truckin) Crumb playing his banjo. Bill Mahoney and many more.  Open mike nights, movies Sunday nights. A post outside the front door rowdies got wrapped around.

And if the nightly musical talent wasnt sustaining your interest, there was a selection of board games and pool tables.

The AB was a forerunner for The Graduate The Grad (table styles), the Cantina Del Cabo Cabo (food and ambiance).  The Circle AB, (now Pine Trails) was related.

Others on G Street at the time: Wooden Ship (Froggys), Honorable Gees, The Club, The Abby. On F Street: Mousies.

Where the Grad is: Jekel & Hydes? A lounge on Olive Drive with a padded door.
