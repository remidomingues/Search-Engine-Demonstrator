The term Antiques designates a class of consumer good that is generally old.  Antiquing is the shopping hobby of scouting around flea markets and garage sales in hopes of finding a serendipitous bargain.  Antiquing is also the woodworking technique of distressing an item so as to give the appearance of being well worn from age and use.  Antique items differ from vintage by wording custom; clothes are vintage, furniture is antique.  An antique store is also not a consignment store; consignment is a middleman between seller and buyer, whereas antiques vendors are the direct seller.  Antique stores contain a variety of wares.  This typically includes a lot of wooden itemsfurniture like dining tables with chairs, end tables, coffee tables, dressers, sideboard hutches, plant stands, Hoosier cabinets, bookshelves.  There are often lamps, bowls on crocheted doilies, paintings in frames, silverplate decorative bowls, sterling silver spoons, pressed glass items, and sets of dinnerware, teacups, and wineglasses.  Sometimes there are old books, musical instruments, or costume jewelryit depends on the preferences of the proprietor as to what goods are stocked.  It is fairly likely that there will be artificial fruit somewhere in the store.
