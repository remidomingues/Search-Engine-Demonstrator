CLOSING: The store is selling everything at discount prices and accepting offers. Theyll close their doors before the end of March.

Antiques Plus Sell & Buy is a great addition to downtown Davis. Normans prices are amazing (meaning low, not high) and he will tell you where he got his stock  including important information regarding the background and authenticity of each piece. Mirrors, stained glass, jewelry, art artwork  he has it all. If you want to give a gift that is tasteful, interesting and beautiful, this is the place to shop.

The place is beautifully laid out and has a good, varied selection, but the jewelry is a STEAL. All real materials and designs so unique that if you paid for them new, even made out of fake metal, it would be more. However Norm does get in other things (like pocketwatches, which are notably missing) that he sells on ebay so if you want him to look for something for you just ask. Hes traveled all over the world and speaks several languages.

Norman has fantastic energy, and his shop has some beautiful and unusual items and a beautiful layout, so you can enjoy your shopping visit. Feel comfortable asking questions, hes easygoing, personable and funny. Jewelry, crystal, furniture, art and more. Youll love his style, personality and feel as if you were engaging a knowledgeable and entertaining friend. He has created a layout thats easy to navigate,spacious and yet filled with beautiful items and articles of interest, so you feel comfortable taking our time and able to access and admire things thoroughly.

20091217 19:57:55 nbsp I am seriously addicted to this place for their jewelry. The place is beautifully laid out and has a good, varied selection, but the jewelry is a STEAL. All real materials and designs so unique that if I paid for them new, even made out of fake metal, it would be more. However he (Norm) does get in other things (like pocketwatches, which are notably missing) that he sells on ebay so if you want him to look for something for you just ask. Hes traveled all over the world and speaks several languages, and I appreciate that too. Users/dizzyditz

20111209 19:15:04 nbsp This place is completely grand, it is full of items that you would never expect to find anywhere. The lady that works there during the day is very helpful and always have your best interest at heart. Full of old stuff that make you just want to buy everything. Everything is neatly setup like you would find it in your own home. I love it. Users/XavierAlexisGarcia

20121013 17:46:22 nbsp Walked in there because I love antiques and wanted to look around,.but didnt feel the slightest bit welcomed. Not sure if its a racial thing or if the lady just couldnt be bothered. Oh well, nice place though. Users/kg18
