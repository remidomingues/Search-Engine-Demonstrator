Antlers was born in Davis, California in 2005 with only a few birth defects. Easily repaired by noninvasive surgery, Antlers was one of the sweatiest Music Scene bands in Davis. After numerous shows in the area, bad weather, delayed practice spaces, and fumigated garages forced them to relocate to Oakland, California. They have recently completed a composition of songs that will soon be released on some form, and take approximately 3,667 seconds to inhale. Dont worry though, Antlers has done a lot of inhaling as well.
