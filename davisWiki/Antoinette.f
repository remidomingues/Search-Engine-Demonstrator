 Hi there! My name is Antoinette Van Dewark, Im new to Avant Garde Studio, and cant be more excited to start working in this beautiful city of Davis. Ive always known that Ive wanted to do hair, I love Up Dos the more the merrier. Specializing in color, I love adding my own personal touch to make your hair a custom work of art. Ive attended numerous Toni and Guy cut classes, as well as assisting Loreal and Farmesi Color Specialtists. Im thrilled to be opening up my business with this new area, in such a goregous salon. So come by and check out all the great services Avant Garde Studio has to offer!




20120820 11:49:20 nbsp I have only been to Antoinette once now and I know that I definitely want to be on her client list! She may be new to the salon, but she definitely knows what she is doing. Her best quality is how much she cares for customers/clients. She listened very well to what I wanted, and patiently answered every question I asked about certain hairstyles with easytounderstand howtos and tips. I HIGHLY recommend giving this woman your business! Users/ZarreenAli

20120903 11:11:44 nbsp I wasnt very familiar with ombre highlights, so I did some research and showed Antoinette what I liked. She fully understood what I was looking for and clarified what would be best for my hair type. My hair came out exactly as I wanted, and was very pleased and impressed with how Antoinette was able to replicate the look I showed her. The color came out exactly as I wanted, and I love that she understood and was able to give me a new hair color that still looked natural on me. Its important for me to feel I can trust a stylist with color, and I can definitely trust that Antoinette knows what shes doing when it comes to ombre. She is also a very sweet person with excellent customer service and will go out of her way to make sure she understands the hair style youre looking for. Thanks! I will be looking forward to my next ombre! Users/marthapietrucha
