While it may or may not be true that Davis is built on one gigantic ant hill, its fair to say that if you live in Davis long enough, sooner or later you will have a major ant invasion.

In terms of food, ants seek out proteins and sugars... Theyre not really interested in lettuce and other foods lacking these two groups. Jello (though not the sugarfree variety) seems to provide ants with both of what they crave! Filling up on their bounty, the accordionlike plating surrounding the ants abdomen expands as the creature fills its two stomachs; one stomach is for personal use, while the other, known as the crop, provides food for others in the colony. Once theyve found a food source, ants will secrete a chemical trail from their abdomen to provide a path back to the source for the rest of the nest. Back at the nest, ants will share tasters from their crop, and the rush is on! The rest of the colony caravans out to the food source to fill up and provide food for other friends back at the nest.

Sometimes ants will also forage for water, lapping up spilled contact solution, or drinking straight from the tap.


The ants you will most likely find are Californias favorite invasive Hymenopteran, Linepithema humile. The common name for this ant is the Argentine Ant, owing to its country of origin. Because only one colony was imported, (hopefully by accident) the ants lack the genetic diversity to differentiate between colonies and will form huge polydomous nests, meaning they have multiple queens. Argentine Ants in Davis, Redding, and Los Angeles would consider each other sisters and join forces against us.

They have ousted most native ants and have found a niche picking up after the crumbs we leave behind, like unpaid janitors.  They will descend upon and ravage the dinner we left on the floor while we went to the bathroom, or crawl through the threads of a poorly sealed jar of honey and spoil it. They are so small and numerous that they can attack and kill entire Honeybees honeybee hives!

 Help! Invasion! 


  Disrupt the chemical trail using ammoniabased products such as window cleaners.
  Use a QTip and put Vaseline in all the holes and cracks you see them come into.  Its safe, nontoxic for your house, ants hate it and wont cross it, and it doesnt dry out, so it keeps on protecting!!
  A solution made by dissolving aspirin in water seems to dissuade the buggers, they also hate hot chili oil.
  Bait does seem to help a lot.  The primary problem with bait is that it takes a few days before they stop coming around after you get them the bait.  But, its better than spraying nasty chemicals.  So, soap, bait and a clean house are the best bets.
  Recent http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060331153612.htm research at UCSD has found that irrigating the ground attracts Argentine ants. When you stop irrigating, they move out. Therefore, if you want to keep these ants away from your house, let the ground dry up around it. That might mean digging up your ornamentals and replacing them with droughttolerant natives.
