One year in the ancient past, Cardozorama entered a float in Picnic Day that consisted of a flatbed pickup with a vertical pole.  Oh yeah, and they hired an exotic dancer to entertain using this set.  Needless to say Cardozorama had a bit of a muchdeserved image problem for several decades, but in the last decade, it has greatly improved its image.

The name is in honor of wiki:WikiPedia:Benjamin_N._Cardozo Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo.
