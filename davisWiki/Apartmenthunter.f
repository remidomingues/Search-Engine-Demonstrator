Howdy, Mr. (or Ms.) Hunter, and Welcome to the Wiki!  You might want to reconsider using this account, and possibly instead Importance of using your RealName sign up under the name your friends call you.  This account name makes sense now, but once you find an apartment, it will be sort of odd.  Plus it is kind of difficult to get to know you.  Should we call you Appy?

20070826 23:30:45 nbsp i liked your comment about the workers at restaurants on the thai bistros page.  You mentioned that thai bistro was the most authentic thai food in davis.  I was wandering if you have ever been to thai recipes? Ive been told its more authentic than thai bistro, but i have never been to thailand nor grown up with someone who cooked thai food in their family.    Users/MattHh
