Apartments are things in which most nonfreshman students live (except engineering students, who live in Kemper Hall). Some apartments can be found just a block away from campus, but those closest to campus are usually older. While we try to list as many apartment complexes as weve seen around town, many of the smaller and older complexes only advertise through a property management firm, or by word of mouth. Rent in Davis can be as low as $250 or so if you share a room; take a look at our Rental Housing Guide for tips on housing within Davis and things to consider for firsttime renters. Davis provides affordable housing to low income individuals through the Section 8 Voucher program, and some low income rental communities are offered through Community Housing Opportunities Corporation CHOC  participating apartment complexes are identified. Apartment complexes that are known to offer monthmonth leases are marked also offers monthmonth, but most leases in Davis are annual agreements; some complexes offer 6 month leases and a few may offer an 11 month lease with an optional 12th month. Before the end of your lease, you will be asked to sign a lease renewal. Again, please take a look at our Rental Housing Guide for a more rounded picture of the rental housing situation in Davis.

When comparing rents, be sure to ask what utilities and city services are included. Many Davis apartments charge a separate fee for water usage, garbage service, or sewer service on top of the rent. It is called the NWP bill (National Water and Power bill). This bill is not issued based on how much water you use. Instead, you pay for a percentage of what the complex as a whole uses. A place that offers free Internet and cable may not be quite the deal it seems when you have to pay for your water too. Its also worth considering what kinds of neighbors you would like to have. Some complexes (especially those closest to campus) have reputations as sophomore dorms or have a mix of students while others have higher populations of nonstudents. Other things to consider: Is there a noisy leafblower which will disturb you? Is it near a street (so you will be woken by morning garbage and recycling trucks)? Is it on the ground floor (so you will have no privacy people looking in your windows as they pass by)?

Some complexes have pretty nice managers and maintenance staff, but some owners can be a bit Shadiness Factor shady  if you end up living at these places you may need to know your tenant rights.  On moving day apartment Dumpster Diving dumpsters are ransacked and the town turns to chaos.  One of the best things you can do is make friends with the maintenance crew.  Usually just acknowledging their existence when you see them is sufficient for this purpose.  Once they get to know you, they will often be much better about making timely repairs.

Many apartments in Davis take advantage of students inexperience in identifying quality housing, low incomes, high demand, and a lack of good alternatives within the Davis housing market.  Examples of this (as noted throughout this wiki) include poor maintenance response time, poorly maintained apartments, Bad Apartment Design low construction quality, low quality furnishings, leases that begin and end on exactly the same day throughout Davis, failure to return security deposits in the time required by law, and generally poor treatment of residents. (Note that there is substantial variation in these issues among different apartments.)  If you are looking for housing, or if you are currently renting at a complex, be sure that your apartment meets suitable housing standards.

It is a very good idea to consider renters insurance, which will protect your possessions.  If your apartment is broken into and all your expensive items are taken, or if a neighbor sets their kitchen on fire and your electronics die of smoke inhalation, you are otherwise simply out of luck.
