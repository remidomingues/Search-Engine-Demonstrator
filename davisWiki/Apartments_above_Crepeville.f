20080601 13:17:35 nbsp I remember when Davisville first got dirt roads installed.  My, that was a big improvement.  The horses didnt have to step over as much stuff in the fields, and when your horse broke down, it was much easier to call for a toe (hoof) truck to replace your flat shoes.

But that was nothing compared to the sight of the dinosaurs who roamed around here 150 million years ago.  Back then, the Sierras were just starting to get pushed up, and you cleared your own road with your dinosaur.  (I had one of the new, fuel efficient, herbivores that used 10 times less energy than some of the meat eaters because you could convert the plants directly to energy.  Unfortunately, those were big and ungainly, and I eventually traded in my old dinosaur of a dinosaur for a new, small, mammal.  Then the meteor hit, and everyone realized that climate change wasnt just something that the scientists were talking about.)

I remember when Crepevilles building wasnt there too... Users/IDoNotExist
