My name is Evan Edwards, but even my wife calls me Wokky, short for my nickname, JabberWokky.  We generally use Importance of Using Your RealName real names around here, but even if you choose to be anonymous, Id highly recommend you not use the name of your business.  We dont know who you are when you do that, and just like Davis itself, were a friendly (and bike friendly) community.  Its up to you, but Ill go ahead and encourage you to create a new account with your name so we can all say hi when we see you on the street.  Also the redirect from your user entry makes things even more difficult... its hard to talk to a neighbor when they keep kicking you to their business entry.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20070925 15:51:40 nbsp You seem to also be naming the entry about Apex to a shorter, more marketingfocused URL.  Keep in mind that the Davis Wiki is a resource for everybody, and the entry is written by and intended to serve the community, not just the business itself. Users/JabberWokky

20070925 17:40:49 nbsp I agree  When commenting on other pages, it would seem that Apex Cycles & Service is standing behind those comments, and not the person who wrote them. The distinction is small considering that the person running this account is probably the owner of the company, however, you can see how this runs awry when a user representing a company is commenting on the page of another company, trying to pull business. (See http://daviswiki.org/B%26L_Bike_Shop?actiondiff&version238&version135 this edit.) ApexBikes, as you seem to be an account for the owner of Apex Cycles & Service, please consider using your Importance of using your RealName RealName. Users/KarlMogel

20070926 15:24:16 nbsp Please use your real name and respect the fact that this is a community resource, not your private web hosting service.  thanks. Users/Graham.Freeman

20070926 16:18:52 nbsp how do I change my user name so it reflects who I am am, besides what I do? Users/ApexBikes

20070926 16:49:20 nbsp I suggest reregistering with your name and dump the pseudonym. Thats the easiest way. Users/KarlMogel

20070926 20:03:41 nbsp Wont this person have trouble if s/he tries to register a new account using the same email address as the ApexBikes account? Users/Graham.Freeman
  Yes, they may have to go to the settings link in the upper corner and disable their existing account before creating the new one. Users/JasonAller

20070926 20:04:34 nbsp Thanks, Apex Person, for your willingness to respect our wiki community norms.  :) Users/Graham.Freeman
