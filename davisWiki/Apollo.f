This work preserves an early welded metal sculpture by
the artist that stood on campus from the early 1960s
until 1982.  Deteriorating from metal rot, the piece was
reworked by the artist and cast in bronze with funds
provided by the office of the chancellor. Ralph Johnson
taught in the Department of Art from 1957 until 1988.
