You see to be wanting to start race fights on the wiki. Please refer to Wiki Ethics. We dont need extremely controversial, off topic things here. Race talk is fine but can be contributed to through Race & Ethnicity. Also, as an aside, please refrain from using fuck and other objectionable language on this family oriented website if possible. EDIT: I realize I just said shit, sorry for the heated emotional language.  JH

20050821 19:16:01 nbsp Just curious: what could you say to us at the next BBQ that you cant tell us (or show us) online?  Were willing to listen to whatever argument you can make. Users/BrentLaabs

20050825 06:12:40 nbsp Hey, cool picture!  Thats a Tiger Mosquito.  I know because in the early 90s, I was the first person to identify a Tiger Mosquito in Palm Beach County, Florida.  Captured and brought it in, too.  I have always liked biology, especially microbio, and the Tiger was a new disease vector entering the state at the time.  (Yes, I am a geek). Users/JabberWokky

20050825 10:09:49 nbsp Hey, Apollo... I rendered your addition to Ruths page down to the facts.  If you want, revert, but I have a feeling it will wind up being reworked a bit to have a bit less vitrol.  (My favorite quote was something along the lines of After the panel of scientists left the meeting got much more relaxed.  Overall, Im happy, although we didnt get any real answers.  Heh. Users/JabberWokky

20050918 23:11:57 nbsp I didnt remove your comment, but I can see why the comment was removed. It would be one thing if you were suggesting that Bistro 33 has discriminatory hiring practices, or is committing sexual harassment with their employees. Otherwise, that kind of a comment is a big invasion of privacy. I dont see how anyones sex life is appropriate content for the Wiki Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050924 13:25:45 nbsp are you seriously getting sued for libel? because that would be awesome. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050925 22:44:43 nbsp Id throw information on Condoms on the Sex page. Users/BrentLaabs

20050926 00:07:28 nbsp no, itd be bad for the wiki dumbass, unless you think prior review is cool. besides two of my friends got hired and none of them were banged, yet, so i retracted the claim, for now. Users/ApolloStumpy

20050926 03:49:03 nbsp Why do you insist on making stupid pages? Just because you had a thought doesnt mean it belongs on the wiki. Users/TravisGrathwell

20051002 11:58:48 nbsp you can find out Redrums health dept. records by calling (530)6668646 id be interested to hear them too!  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051002 16:12:16 nbsp whats your obsession with Walmart? Users/EdWins ES

20051003 11:15:54 nbsp This guy is a trolls troll. Users/JackHaskel

20051004 08:40:27 nbsp DavisWiki is not intended to be bias free.  Where did you get that idea?  Wikipedia has a funky NPOV rule, but this isnt Wikipedia (you can tell by the logo in the upper left hand corner) ;) Users/JabberWokky

20051023 22:34:08 nbsp Go waste your obviously large amounts of free time on something else, jackass. Users/DylanBeaudette

20051023 22:36:16 nbsp Hey guy, please stop being so rude all the time.  Youre harshing my mellow, man. Users/MikeIvanov

20051026 20:01:22 nbsp Do you ever say anything nice? Users/KenjiYamada

20051029 23:59:44 nbsp Youre awesome. Keep up the good work. Users/RoyWright

20051030 04:51:45 nbsp i apologize if my lack of perfect grammar at such an early hour offended you. if you always have something to defend your statements, why dont you simply state them instead of getting agressive? with your troll name and attitude on this wiki, you shouldnt be surprised by the widespread hatred of you here. atleast put your real name down, no ones going to physically attack you in public or anything, with a real name well atleast take you a little more seriously. and yes, i should so be banned for using bad grammar. because we dont have editing options. Users/MichelleAccurso

20051117 22:58:28 nbsp Sex Offenders:  The list is not complete and there is no need to duplicate it as it can be found on their website, which is mandiated to be updated. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051118 21:10:19 nbsp While the majority of the 24 listed sex offenders committed a crime against a minor 14 years old or younger, I dont think its worth noting (in the way you wrote it, at least) as its akin to saying that the majority of convicted burglars have broken and entered.  Its not surprising, as these are convicted sex offenders.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051219 01:01:41 nbsp Your Ikea edits cracked me up.  Users/EdWins ES

20060114 16:23:45 nbsp Re: Commons Grounds wifi.  2Mbps vs. 11Mbps vs. 54Mbps is irrelevant when the uplink is 1.5Mbps or slower.  Whats your rationale for changing my edit?  (Im not trying to be confrontational  just want to discuss.) Users/GrahamFreeman

20060124 13:39:10 nbsp Have you been to any restaurants in Davis that arent staffed by assholes and jerks?  Serving you must be a real treat.  You have no clue what you are talking about regarding food and drink yet consider your wait staff jerks and assholes when your food is not to your exact liking.  Ever consider sending food back or asking for it to be made differently, or perhaps reading the menu or asking what is in the item before ordering it?  Youll save yourself and your server a hell of a lot of trouble and headache.    Users/JeffSpeckles

20060130 22:22:02 nbsp Are insults and flame wars necessary?  Users/DavisWikiGnome

20060201 00:16:14 nbsp I am sorry if it looks like I am creating a manifesto. I am just creating a page for my party, which is not done yet, so it looks like propoganda now. But in a week, it will look better. But if that bugs you, Ill change it so nothing will be there until the final product Users/MichaelMolnar

20060208 11:05:52 nbsp I love the writeup for the Featured Page.  Witty and well linked. Users/JabberWokky
