Apple Inc. makes computers, consumer electronics, and software. It is also one of the worlds largest music retailersFootNote(http://www.news.com/iTunesoutsellstraditionalmusicstores/21001027_35965314.html). Apple is well known for its successful marketing strategy and heavy emphasis on proprietary software. Apple commands a 8.1%FootNote(http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/10/17/apples_u_s_mac_market_share_rises_to_8_1_percent_in_q3.html) market share in personal computers, but boasts a 74%FootNote(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod) market share in the US for digital music players (the iPod).

Okay, now that the corporate speak and sales and market figures are out of the way, lets be honest: Davis has a sweaty torrid love affair with little bits of glass and metal with that iconic applewithabite.  Apple products are highly popular among college students (and thus highly visible in college towns) to start out with, and are also popular on the west coast, and finally have a shine of anticorporate outsider appeal (which, like any such halo, is hotly contested by some people).  That comes together to make Apple products quite the popular item among Davis residents.  And outside Davis  as of July 2011 it has http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/applemoremoneyfederalgovernment163023405.html more cash reserves than the U.S.

The Davis Mac Users Group has been around for years, and offers monthly meetings, a citywide Mac discussion email list, and a range of members from the experienced to the new user.

Davis has been featured in in several iPhone and iPod Touch applications. DavisTrans displays Unitrans transit information including bus location and schedule information. Davis Routes displays an overview of the entire community, and gives the user access to a speedometer and route mapping while they ride their bicycle. The realtime civic engagement tool, UC Davis Campus Reporter, allows users to identify civic issues (potholes, graffiti, snow removal) and report them to facilities management. Check out UC Davis Mobile for a look at a campus map and class schedules.

If youre tired of proprietary corporate operating systems from Microsoft and Apple, Linux is an free, open source, community programed operating system. Most Linux distros (distributions) run nicely on Macintosh hardware and are particularly good for use on older equipment that has been declared obsolete by Windows and OS X performance specs.

Before Davis Wiki was even placed online, Wiki History when it was first being created, it lived aboard an iBook G4.  Since then, quite a bit of development of the software side of things has been done on Apple laptops.

20060410 22:02:36 nbsp Ive heard bad things about the
 quality of build of apple laptops.  I know a few people who have had them break repeatedly. Users/ZacMorris

20070210 10:50:08 nbsp I had an iBook G3 that was an absolute lemon and wouldnt work, even after 5 logic board swaps (wtf?). Im rather happy with my current PowerBook G4, though. Ive only had a few problems and they have been repaired promptly. Users/WilliamLewis

20070212 20:32:10 nbsp My PowerBook has broken.  Three times.  All three times, Apple has agreed to pay for repair, even after the computer went beyond warranty.  There is a key to dealing with these Apple peopleâ€”one key is staying on the phone with them as long as it takes.  The other key?  Well, message me your specific problem and Ill help you get your computer fixed. Users/GreggAlexander

20070515 00:22:35 nbsp Well, I love all the Mac bashing, but we have 3 mac laptops, one Imac and 3 older macs (including a mac classic).  All work perfectly.  My son had a pc because he was worried about game programs, but since getting his mac he says he wont ever go back.  They may be more expensive, but theyre totally worth it! Users/Davidlm

20070515 10:53:18 nbsp Ive had five Macintoshes over the course of mumble years.  The last two were laptops; my current laptop is over three years old.  Ive had minimal problems with any of these machines. Users/CovertProfessor

20071101 21:19:31 nbsp Ive finally had enough of the bad support from Apple.  I always advise my clients to avoid vendor lockin lest they suffer from the lack of choice; its time I took my own advice.  So, I just ordered a tablet PC on which Ill run Ubuntu.  Now it wont matter that Apple will take at least a week  possibly a month  to fix the latest hardware failure on my MacBook Pro, nor will it matter that Apple continues to try to prevent me from using my iPod with other software besides iTunes.  Buhbye! Users/Graham.Freeman

20081127 20:24:45 nbsp I love my macbook.  Users/Jeserah

20081221 16:02:04 nbsp I loved your macbook.  It was very tasty.  munch munch Users/IDoNotExist

20081221 16:08:52 nbsp On vendor lockin, Im not sure that you have much advantage with going with a regular PC maker over Apple.  For example, if you order your PC from Dell, you are locked into Dells service and support (unless you decide to buy your own replacement parts instead of using Dells components.)  Most computers from PC makers ship only with Windows, so you are locked into both Microsoft and your hardware vendor for service.  Of course, you can, as you mentioned, put Linux or another OS on your PC.  But you can also do this with any modern Mac.  In fact, unlike a PC, you can also run OS X (legally, with proper support and updates) on your Mac.  You can not do this on a regular PC.  So on a regular PC, you are locked into fewer choices of operating systems.  Consumer Reports regularly rates Apples hardware as having the fewest problems.  That doesnt mean that you will never have a problem  just that you have a lower probability of having one. Users/IDoNotExist
  I cant comment on other manufacturers, but HP allows you to upgrade hard drives, ram, and even WAN cards, without invalidating your warranty. Also, your point about being able to install OS X seems odd to me, since the message seems to be that Apple makes it illegal, and unsupported, for you to install it on anything other than their proprietary hardware. That sounds like a lockin to me. At this point it seems to me that a persons choice of computer is based solely on their own preference. There doesnt seem to be any major innate superiority. I mostly choose PCs because i am used to them and because I cannot stand Macs insufferable commercials. Users/JoePomidor

20081221 18:21:00 nbsp On legality: OS X is licensed for use with Apple branded computers.  Whether or not that is enforceable may be tested in court one of these days, but for now, that is the case.

On warranties: Apple allows you to upgrade everything too without invalidating your warranty.  They wont cover third party components in their warranty.  ie.  If you buy a third party hard drive and it goes bad, they will repair or replace your computer, but wont fix the third party hard drive, because they didnt supply it.  Some PC vendors will not support your machine if you run Linux, or even if you install any third party software, even if the fault is with the hardware, unless you reimage your machine with their install disk.

On lockin: If you want to run OS X, you have to use Apple hardware.  (There are a few ways around this that may or may not be legal.  Those havent been tested in court, and are unsupported by Apple, but people do use them.)  However, this doesnt lock you to Apples hardware OR software.  There is a Windows, Linux, and OS X all have programs that will read and modify data created on each others platforms (including Microsoft Office documents).  Moving your data between platforms is as easy as transferring your data between machines using your favorite method.  In that sense, the underlying OS and hardware is irrelevant, so long as it meets your needs.  I totally agree that you should go with whatever you feel most comfortable with.  You can also run Windows and Linux simultaneously, at nearly full speed, on your Mac alongside OS X if you really need to.  I should note that Microsoft has repeatedly found itself in antitrust suits in the US and EU for leveraging proprietary and hidden functionality tied to Windows to lock people into using Windows.

My personal experience has been that Apples hardware has been more reliable than than of other vendors, and also more reliable than my own home built hardware.  I run many different machines in many different configurations with many different operating systems.  The easiest to maintain, by far, are the OS X boxes, followed by the Linux systems.  I find myself putting much more time into maintaining my Windows systems (ie. keeping them up to date with security patches) than I actually spend using them!  It also takes me the least time to make an OS X box do what I want it to, and I get the best performance on most things that I do with OS X (again, with Linux in second place and Windows last.)  There are also many nice features on OS X that I use heavily that simply have no equivalent on Windows (although they can usually be replicated with some effort on Linux).

If you are looking for the very cheapest system, you probably wont find it from Apple.  Apple doesnt want to sell to the very low end of the market, because it isnt profitable.  Many people argue that you can get a Windows system more cheaply than a Mac, and that is true if the systems do not have equivalent hardware (again, because there are no Macs at the very low end of the market.)  If you price out systems with nearly identical hardware, the Macs are usually priced about the same, and sometimes for quite a bit less (check out the Mac Pro vs. Dells 8 core Xeon workstations.)  Thats a business decision on Apples part on which part of the market they want to pursue.  Many people dont agree with it, but Apple has remained extremely profitable while companies like Dell are now in deep trouble, so it looks like a viable strategy.

If you are looking for the best system, that really depends on what you are doing with it.  For certain tasks, Id recommend Linux over OS X, and for some, Windows might be the best choice (if you mainly want to play games, for example).  For the sorts of tasks that most people do, Id recommend OS X.  Many people dual boot Windows on Macs for games, or Linux on Windows boxes for development work.

If you are very security conscious, I would recommend OS X to most people.  For people who are very security conscious, dont mind lots of additional work, and are technically savvy, OpenBSD or FreeBSD might even be a good choice.  I would not recommend those for most people though.  While I probably know as many people at all skill levels with Macs as PCs, it is always the PC users who have the virus infested machines, spyware, adware, and other problems, never the Mac or Linux users.  If you are even more security conscious, I would recommend turning off your computer and picking up a good book.  :)

On the commercials: I find them very entertaining, but obviously some people dont like them.  Microsoft recently responded to the ads by calling its operating system chewy and delicious, and comparing it to dress shoes and churros.  (Really!  It did!)  Im not sure why this would get me to use Windows, even if churros are very tasty, since I dont usually try to eat my operating system.  But why chose your software based on an advertising campaign?
