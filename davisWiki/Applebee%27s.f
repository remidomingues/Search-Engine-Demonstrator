Applebees is a chain restaurants restaurant that serves Americana type food and sports a Bars bar. It is currently the largest casual dining restaurant chain in the world. Their prices range from $6.99 Lunch Specials lunch combos to $17 rib/steak dinners.  Some dispute this particular Applebees quality compared to other chain restaurants. The Applebees chain by was bought by IHOP Corp. on November 29, 2007. IHOP decided to franchise Applebees. What this means that the restaurants are sold to local owners throughout the country and those local owners pay Applebees to use the company name on the restaurants. The local owner pays Applebees a percentage of the profits from the restaurants. This particular Applebees has been acquired by Apple American Group which is a local franchise owner. Like some other franchised restaurants, some Applebees dishes are microwaved as part of the cooking process.

Several of their entrees are from inauthentic Cajun Cuisine Cajun or Cajuninspired recipes. They are all terrible. They are most popular for their burgers, steak steaks and sizzling skillet entrees. They have a very large menu that changes regularly incorporating seasonal fruits and vegetables, and have a whole menu page devoted to items under 550 calories. They also feature a full service bar.

happy hour specials Happy hours  are:
  MondayFriday 3pm6pm & 9pmclose

An http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/20050421/cover.asp article written for the Sacramento News & Review  took place at the Davis Applebees. The reporter was there to infiltrate a local group of white supremacists who met for dinner there. The article generated http://www.sfist.com/archives/2005/05/03/sacto_weekly_asked_for_retraction.php a very mild scandal as to how it was presented.

Like all Applebees restaurants, part of their shtick is that they have lots of random junk on the walls, like posters, sports equipment, musical instruments, etc.  Some of this is obviously provided by the chain headquarters (many different restaurant locations have most of the exact same decor), but each chain also has a lot of local memorabilia.  This includes photos of the fire department, davis police department, and the DHS Football high school football team.

Beginning April 2013 they will be undergoing a remodel which features new lighting, decor, and seating adding a much more modern and vibrant feel. They will remain open during remodel and are auctioning the memorabilia that currently adorns the walls including vintage posters, fun bar signs, and a carousel horse, as well as the chairs and the tiffany lamps.

They regularly hold special late night events, including discounted food and drinks that revolve around the theme. Upcoming events include:
  04182013 Cowboy Night  featuring line dancing on the patio
  05052013 Cinco de Mayo Party
  TBA Tiki Party

20050523 11:48:03 nbsp Notsoaffectionately known as Crapplebees.  The few times I have been there, the food arrived lukewarm and the service was about the same. users/AlexPomeranz

20050523 12:18:08 nbsp Why is it, that whenever chains are introduced into Davis, they always pick the worst one?  Hmm... TGI Fridays?  Chilis?  No, lets do Applebees...!   users/JaimeRaba

20050524 02:43:53 nbsp I have no reference, but I swear that the print version of the interview was longer and made it clear that the supremacists he interviewed lived several hours away, up in the foothills or mountains.  They arent local  at least no more so than someone from Chico is local (its all relative). users/JabberWokky

20051212 13:18:45 nbsp We actually had a good experience we were 3 adults and a kid with bueger, steak, salad and kids menu (and desert) it was defintly a good experience, actually better than we expected... users/GilCo

20051212 14:46:28 nbsp Been there once.  Not keen on the flavor or presentation. users/JudithTruman

20051212 17:59:12 nbsp It is not the best AppleBees in the world, but many people have reported that its much improved since it opened.  Anyone know if they have any happy hour specials?  Or perhaps they do well enough drawing on the freeway crowd. users/JaimeRaba

20051216 10:15:50 nbsp Its meh here... Its what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  I rarely eat here. users/JoAnnaRich

20060305 20:43:14 nbsp Wow, not happy with this place.  This is my first (and last) time eating at this Applebees, and its certainly soured any future experience with the chain.  (1) Chilis is better.  And cheaper.  Nuff said.  (2) I got the babyback ribs, and they came with fries, cole slaw, and baked beans.  Only problem: while eating said cole slaw, I found a bestby date sticker.  And it was expired.  The tag read Best By Feb 24 06 but I was eating it on March 3rd.  (3)  I told the waitress, she told the manager, the manager came out and embarrassed me in front of all my friends, making a big scene about Were you the one who got the suprise?  He then very creepily said that I should wait and thered be a surprise for me.  This surprise was apparently an unorderedicedtea charge on the bill, and only $3.00 off from my meal.  I promptly talked to the waitress, and she removed the charge for my dinner.  (4)  Pathetic. users/JulieEickhof

20060306 19:19:08 nbsp dont eat here, its bad for your soul users/AviBirns

20060402 10:03:30  nbsp Ahhh, Applebees.  Every time I go there, they never fail to disappoint me.  The latest is no exception.  So you are probably asking, So why do you go there if you are always disappointed?  The answer is...I just dont know.  Perhaps it is the fact that maybe the last time was a fluke and that there was only one less than satisfactory meal servered that day and that kharma decided that I were to be the recipient of said meal.  Or perhaps that I have a tendency to block out any unpleasant event from my memory allowing me to constantly learn from my mistakes...and then forget.  Here is the rundown:

   To begin with, our waitress was fantastic.  Very nice, refilled my soft drink without asking, and didnt stop by the table for the obligatory so how is your meal question while our mouths were full.  No complaints on service.  Unfortunately, she committed the cardinal error of suggested selling.  First she recommended two different tasty and icecold drinks, then she recommended two different delicious appetizers, then two different delicious main courses, and finally two different delicious desserts. By using the word delicious, I was thinking she was recommending items from a different restaurant.

   I ordered the Black and Blue burger with fries thinking, how hard would it be to messup a burger???  Apparently, not that hard at all for Applebees.  It seems that Applebees has been able to alter the timespace continuum.  For no sooner than the waitress walked back to deliver the order to the kitchen, the order arrived at our table.  Since I was with a group of people, and nobody mentioned a fainting incident to me, I felt that the order arrived way too fast to be fresh. They could give lessons to McDonalds.  It was easy to tell that the only thing on the plate that was fresh was the toasting on the bun.  Everything else had that precooked and keptwarm taste, texture, and appearance.  The burger was dry and tasteless. The only thing that prevented the burger patty from being used as a hockey puck was that it was a little too soft for a hockey puck. The black part of the burger (spicy seasonings???) were nowhere to be found.  The blue cheese sauce resembled and tasted like lumpy mayonnaise.  The oneinch thick slice of red onion made the burger taste like an onion sandwich rather than a hamburger.  I had to constantly add ketchup (catsup) to choke the thing down.  The french fries were just as dated as the burger.  Not enough ketchup at the table to make them taste good.

Overall, another disappointing visit to Applebees.  I recommend that if you want a good burger, go elsewhere.  Try The Graduate for a better burger experience. users/GruntledMonkey

20060402 10:53:49 nbsp drinks here are expensive!  I would say youre better off going to Dennys. users/RohiniJasavala

20060623 13:58:01 nbsp If you absolutely MUST eat at an Applebees, go to the one in Woodland (in the same shopping center as WalMart (1790 E. Main Street)).  Its much better.  I had lunch at the one in Woodland with my company and the food was not only edible, but it was actually halfway decent.  I cant say that about the three or so time Ive been to the Davis one. users/AlexPomeranz

20060911 13:20:04 nbsp How bout we go get kicked out of an Applebees? users/AmyGoogenspa

20061001 16:37:49 nbsp Half price appetizers after 9 oclock. Appetizers are nothing special but worth the reduced prices I think. users/RyanBaldini

20061108 20:47:12 nbsp I dont know why but we had the baby back ribs here, and they flavored it realy weird. different from any other applenees ribs I have ever had. anyway, it was barely edible users/AnnThiNguyen

20070309 10:36:33 nbsp I know for a fact that Applebees never makes food ahead of time, or precooked. A bad burger just happens sometimes, but all the food Ive eaten here has been fresh and good. Ordering food to go there is way better than waiting half an hour and paying more at Murder Burger. Sometimes the waitstaff isnt great, but the management is really nice and helpful.    users/SonnyStack

20070403 21:02:26 nbsp I like Applebees in Davis, very nice :) Users/jamesqi

20070509 00:47:01 nbsp If you have to go there, get the riblets platter! Users/MikeHubby

20070511 19:16:30 nbsp I like this place. Occasionally the food isnt perfect, but the half off appetizers and dollar beers after 9 are great. Once I got cold wings, once I had shredded chips. They fixed both in a timely manner. Its not super expensive, and I like their boneless wings much more than Chilis. Although you have no choice in server, Chadwick and Lauren are the greatest. My only beef with Applebees was the healthy sounding burger on Chibatta bread with some green sauce that was terrible. Whatever tho, appetizers rock. Bring back 1/2 off appetizers on weekends!!! ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Users/William.Peacock

20070521 20:35:52 nbsp Go to IHOP, jesus this place is horrible. Users/AlexKang

20070716 22:22:59 nbsp I have been going there for 4 years about 3 times per year and food is ok different, Hey is it me or does Horatio sanz work three every time i go there there is a waiter that looks just like Horatio sanz ? Users/dickjones

20070716 23:02:16 nbsp Haha, Ive noticed that before too (a guy that looks like Horatio Sanz).  Im not a big fan of Applebees overall.  I went once in a large group, about 22 to 25 people, and had a surprisingly good waiter  the guy actually managed/offered to do individual tabs.  I think we ended up with 5 different tabs for our group (split it by table to make it easy for us). Never saw that guy again though.  The food is alright, nothing special. A bit pricey overall.  I swear they charge different prices for drinks though  when it was just me and my girlfriend, her Midori Sour cost over a dollar less compared to when ordered in that big group.  We havent gone there much in the last 4 or 5 years, much less order that many drinks (a few times during happy hour), but had gone enough to notice that everyones drink seemed to be marked up.  It was $7.something for a Midori Sour, yeah right!   Users/EdWins

20070717 13:33:40 nbsp yes haratio sanz is there this guy would win a look alike contest easy , as for the Drinks same thing happened to us a few times different charges strange , just a average place it is very hard to get good service there it seams like anyway i will go there again for the Indochinese chicken salad that is very good and sweet Users/dickjones

20070718 16:11:04 nbsp Applebees was recently purchased by IHOP.  Not that it will change anything. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070718 21:42:36 nbsp I went here with a group of fellow Unitrans people. Similar to another review written here, the food arrived lukewarm. My friends fruitshake showed up with the water separated from the pulverized fruit. Obviously, they had left it standing for a very long time before they brought it out. The crab cakes I ordered were burnt and crummy. The ribs my other friend ordered were ridiculously mushy like baby food. Im just glad Unitrans paid for the meal in full. I will not and would not return. Users/AlexQuan

20070803 15:35:02 nbsp This place is great just to stay local average food but like i said if want to stay local it is good i love the chicken salad  Users/Brians

20070902 01:44:10 nbsp I kind of feel that half the description on this page being about the scandal hurts the reputation of this place. I mean, how was Applebees supposed to know that they were going to come there?  It seems unrelated to the establishment itself.  In any case I usually get milk shakes or ice cream here.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070914 13:23:21 nbsp does anyone know if they still have half off appetizers after 9? Users/MattHh

20071013 23:09:10 nbsp The last time we were there the waitress dropped silverware on the ground, waited for the customer to walk by and then put it back with the clean ones. Our drink order (which was tea and water) took fifteen minutes. The appetizers were still cold in the middle and our plates had food from the last patrons...........mmmm clean. Every time we tried to get the waiters attention to ask for more water we were ignored or maybe just not heard (intentionally). The obvious disdain for sanitation far outweighed their dislike of customers. I don’t think I will ever go here again or in good conscience let my friends.  Users/Hen

20071129 15:10:35 nbsp Ive loved this place for years. After 9pm, 1/2 off appetizers on weeknights.

Also, they changed managers a little while back and suddenly, the last time I went there, the food was even better than usual. I see a lot of hate on this page, but Ive only had one bad experience out of the many many times over the past few years that Ive gone there, and the waitress fixed it immediately. Try the maple brownie thing... I forgot the name, but it is uhhhhhmazing. Users/William.Peacock

20071216 11:43:01 nbsp I have been happy with this place except once when a friend and I went there for steak, I ordered the ny strip steak, but the size advertised in the menu did not resemble the actual item. I told the waiter and he did nothing. Being a frequent customer, I was shocked at the service that night. Other than this night I have been happy with the food. My favorites on the list include the sampler platter, artichoke and cheese dip, shrimp dishes, pasta, and mozarella sticks. The best thing here are the mixed drinks and the triple choc meltdown with icecream. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20071223 15:09:56 nbsp The staff here are ridiculously slow, I was in a few months back and that was the last time, me and my party waited 15minutes to be seated and the place was empty and then after waiting 20minutes at our table we left due to no one being interested in serving us! The drinks are over priced and have no alcohol in them. Chilis all the way, might be a 20minute drive but thats what you wait at applebees before you even get looked at. Users/DavisResident23

20080217 18:54:09 nbsp It was alright, but keep in mind that I never really liked Applebees to begin with. The food is mediocre and overly priced. I usually like that one side dish, the mashed potatoes with cheese, but theyve ruined that for me.

Ive also tried their combo meals  the ones that are supposed to be a deal but when you see the actual dish its a lot smaller portioned than they make it out to be. Users/feichuhuya

20080330 14:35:34 nbsp Is it just me or does the place just keep getting worse?  It seems like every time I go there, the service gets worse, food is less tasty, the portions are smaller, etc, etc. I like their booths, but the food is bland and boring.  And its rather expensive for what youre getting.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080623 21:33:04 nbsp A group of four of us went there for dinner on a Monday night.  We had average service (cant expect too much from Applebees).  I ordered the the NY Strip and asked for it to be cooked RARE.  It came out MEDIUM.  I know it wasnt the servers fault and made sure that they knew that.  I returned it and said that I would wait for a RARE steak.  The manager (I beleive his name was Rayn who shouldnt be a manager and you will find out why with what happened next) ended up bringing out the steak.  I started cutting into the steak and what do you know?  It was still MEDIUM.  I told him that this wasnt RARE.  Before I could say anything else, he chimes in with these exact words, Im sorry (he wasnt sorry, just sorry that he got me as a guest) but with the health code laws we are not allowed to cook rare.  First of all that was a line of bulls@t (you big dooshbag)!!  Second of all, if that were true, which it isnt, then dont have your servers ask if we want rare, medium rare, medium, or well done you effen retard!  I then asked him what he was going to do about me not getting my steak the way I wanted it.  He replies Im sorry (again).  I can offer you a free dessert?  Im thinking, what the f does this have to do with dessert?  I then walked out.  Users/sytucd

20080623 21:45:25 nbsp Actually, there is in fact a fairly widespread requirement that meat be cooked to a http://www.emd.saccounty.net/Documents/Info/TIMETEMP.MAP.htm certain internal temperature. This is designed to prevent the spread of E. Coli and other foodborne illnesses. I think that the people at Applebees responded in an acceptable manner, given the situation they are in as a chain restaurant with their own set of internal regulations. Users/JoePomidor
   Ignoring that that is for Sacramento County, there are no regulations (even on that page) for steak, which should be okay to serve raw.  Note also that sushi is verboten according to that document, which makes me suspect that it is not at all a legal document.  My wife and I have eaten rare beef all over Northern California with no issues other than one very amusing incident, so unless things have changed recently, Im guessing the manager was just trying to save another steak or leaning on an internal rule that they never normally enforce (as the server put it in rare, and requested it again  specifically rare  and had it come out both times claiming to be rare). Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080624 12:57:18 nbsp Upon revisiting the site, I found that that requirement is for pork, poultry, and ground beef. In any event, it was meant to illustrate that there are such requirements. Users/JoePomidor
   I require you to send me $1000.  Of course, that has no enforcement or legal standing.  Neither do these, as far as I can tell.  In fact, the way this document is linked to http://www.emd.saccounty.net/faqs.htm on the FAQ entry seems to indicate that this is phrased as what we think is required to be safe, not what is required by law that restaurants must follow.  I am not at all saying I have special knowledge about this, just that that document really looks like suggested guidelines, not a statutory requirement of restaurants (consumer law or public health attorneys should feel free to correct me).  In fact, places that grind their own beef routinely advertise and make a big deal that they will serve rare burgers (since its the cross contamination with other ground meats thats the issue, not the beef itself), including restaurants in Sacramento county.  Again, it says seafood must be cooked as well... which, if this were a legal requirement, would outlaw all sushi restaurants.  In short, I think thats a temperatures required to kill germs that we suggest you use and not temperatures restaurants are required to use.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
    I see what you mean now. Given that, I have still seen many restaurants that refuse to cook below a certain level of doneness, and I am not surprised that Applebees is one of them. I think their response to this customer was not unreasonable, although if they do list rare as an option, as sytucd says, then that is definitely a little sketchy.  users/JoePomidor
       The big nonsteakhouse chains are most likely to not allow meat to be served rare, so it wouldnt surprise me if there is an in store regulation (that way they can tolerate a little sloppiness in the supply chain).  The thing thats off with this story is the fact that the order went in twice as rare and was accepted as such.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080630 19:39:11 nbsp I like Applebees but for this particular location, I think the tastiness of the food is a hit or miss. But still a good place to go when you want to eat out. Users/sweetsoni

20080705 19:10:06 nbsp I detect some Davis snobbery in these posts.  This place has great burgers.  The beef is seasoned well, and its as juicy as they come.  Fries are tasty but are usually lukewarm.  Its kind of pricey though.  A burger and fries will set you back 10 bucks.     Users/JimBob

20080712 13:05:04 nbsp I have a friends who likes this place, so I end up here pretty regularly, and I wholly recommend the Teriyaki Buffalo Wings. They are made almost entirely from deliciousness. Users/JoePomidor

20080720 01:12:36 nbsp Its not the best place in Davis to eat, but it can relieve you from hunger. I recommend their ultimate trio, its a pretty good deal. Users/cnk.midori

20081116 20:37:47 nbsp a decent long island i guess. They can pour em kinda weak. on thursdays they have happy hour all night which means cheaper drinks, draughts & appetizers and it can be fun then  Users/Chrissapher

20090204 15:29:32 nbsp Niel (one of the main bartenders) is awesome. We always try to get there before happy hour ends which is like 6pm so we rush on in and Niel is always hurrying to get in our order so we get the happy hour deals. And he always remembers our drinks. Hes got his own regulars there. I love the food too!  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090519 12:43:26 nbsp Our visits are all about one man...Stephan. best freaking waiter ever. Users/patrick82

20090531 09:08:50 nbsp I come here pretty often, its right next to my work and open late, both of which are good for me.
Some of my favorites are the fried shrimp, the fajita rollup, the blondie dessert, and the strawberry sparkling limeade. The fried chicken salad and apple chicken salad are both very good too, make for a nice meal after a late shift.
The staff is very friendly, though sometimes they seem a bit hurried. It can also be very slow if you come late, just before closing (unless its a Friday with happy hour and whatnot)... but theyre really nice about letting people stay late.
If youre looking for fancy eats, not the place. But its convenient and a nice place to get together with friends, even on a budget. Users/KBathory

20090727 17:58:27 nbsp Food: its typical American food (w/ some strange take on Asian food)
Tasteness: medium  something we can all cook if we werent so lazy.
Service: get ready to wait! (I use to think once my party and I order our food they would then go outside and harvest the food)
Would I return: Not anytime soon.

20091017 03:35:38 nbsp This is one of the worst places i have ever went to for dinner. my housemates and myself were hungry and decided to eat at applebees. not only did they get our orders wrong, but they got it wrong TWICE!! they thought we ordered 1 dish when we ordered 3 and when they fixed it, they only gave us 2 of that order. not only was the service bad, but the food itself was not very pleasant. it looked like food that had been left over night and microwaved. after i ate half of my order, i just couldnt continue eating. in fact, none of my housemates finished their meals either. after that, i started feeling sick and had to use the bathroom TWICE in an hour or two. i am definitely NEVER returning to Applebee EVER AGAIN. this will be my FIRST and LAST time eating at Applebees. Users/Jacko

20091229 12:25:02 nbsp This isnt real food.  Not much taste and lots of calories.   Users/stodd84

20100302 18:48:25 nbsp Service is slow/lacking, food is mediocre,tad pricey. The happy hour appetizers are fantastic deals though ($4 buffalo wings anyone?). Generally would advise avoiding unless it is in the late night and you are without any options  though Id personally just go to the 24hr McDonalds drivethrough before trekking out to Applebees... Users/blastoff

20100325 16:43:37 nbsp I like applebees. Just not the one in Davis. I continue to go becasue it is close and easy but I preffer the one in woodland and would choose any other similar franchise if there was one in town. The service is always good but the food is never prepared well and is almost never hot. Users/JoeRandom

20100421 12:39:43 nbsp the hostess  is very welcoming.....id rather have them be the server than the actually servers. the new host is cool....i dont know her name but shes short and Filipino... also the other asian girl as well.....   Users/Karenchuuk

20100609 23:02:55 nbsp Applebees is now open until midnight on weekdays. Amanda is one of their new bartenders. Amanda is a model (no surprise considering shes beautiful) and works
most evenings to supplement her income. Theyve hired several new servers who seem to be doing a good job.  Users/nowhereman

20100703 00:44:57 nbsp If you dont know what applebees tastes like you should probably just break down and give it a try. Its part of the American experience, although not necessarily a good part. The food ranges from mediocre to pretty decent, with an occasional the cooks in back fed this up. Aside from that there isnt really a whole lot to distinguish one applebees from the next, so all that really counts is the service. Ive been to this location twice, both times a couple years ago. The first time the service was excellent. I was in a large group (2030ish) and I dont even think we had made prior reservations (although I do believe we called ahead to check for tables). The staff was friendly and very accommodating, sitting us up in the back patio area by ourselves. The second time around I went with two other friends. There was an order mix up and a member of our group eventually got into an argument with the staff, leading to us being dismissed from the restaurant. I would tend to think that the first time around is more representative of their service, but Im sure order mixups are not uncommon and if I recall correctly the management didnt exactly deal with it in a conciliatory fashion, although we probably didnt help the situation any. Overall, its an applebees. Mediocre food, typically decent service, and cheap enough to be convenient while being costly enough to try to fool you into thinking its a real restaurant.  Users/tjpeck

20100706 16:00:44 nbsp Things seem to be going downhill since I posted a positive review last month.
The food has always been average, but the bar was starting to show signs of
life with the addition of superstars like Amanda and rotating shifts. The GM
is ignoring customer and employee feedback and giving busy closing shifts
to guys who are just soso bartenders. Too bad! Better to ask for a booth
than sit at the bar. The new table servers are cool.

20100814 12:10:33 nbsp Applebees seems to be for the off the freeway crowd... like a Fairfield or Dixon chain restaurant. The last time I went in there it was full of fat out of shape 50 year old white men in shorts, sneakers and Jesus Loves You tee shirts and their incredibly homely spandex wives and dysfunctional children...

Oh yeah, the service was highly dysfunctional, as well...

Unless I am invisible, in which case a ditzy waitress could walk by us 8 times without noticing breathing customers... Do you think you are impressing customers with actual money by ignoring them for a half hour? Is that why white supremacists choose Applebees for their meetings? You can meet for at least 30 minutes without being disturbed or your conversation overheard...  Then when the water arrives you are guaranteed 40 minutes more to plan your next hate event before the waitress comes back?

Maybe she was doing us a favor, trying to get us to give up and leave before the incredibly room temperature food did arrive...  How something can be greasy AND cold is beyond me.... Well I could have gone down to Safeway and bought the Hungry Man BBQ dinner and had better cold food. How does this place stay in business? Oh yeah... all the fat families off of the freeway.

20110224 23:12:25 nbsp Food was loaded! with sodium. Steak was way overcooked...shoe leather. Broccoli was wilted and tasted like a salt shaker. Drinks were literally short, i.e., there was about an inch missing from the cheaper happy hour drink. The sign above the door says welcome back which is ironic considering that all their customers must be first timers. Stole the glass for redemption!  Users/AlexHinxmann

20110302 11:19:45 nbsp Sadly, I didnt much care for Applebees food. I thought I remembered them being decent, but their food may have gone down since the last time I was there (a few years ago). Users/Ravyn

20110304 21:29:12 nbsp Check your drinks/straw before you take a sip. I went there about 2 weeks ago and ordered a margarita 10 minutes before happy hour. When I got it (30 minutes into happy hour), I took a sip and then discovered a nasty SPIDER in my mouth. Dont know if it was in the straw or in the cup but it was there. The managers excuse: we changed the light bulbs in the bar earlier today which I considered a bullshit excuse. Disgusting experience. And this happened on my birthday. I will never come back here again.  Users/IzzyC

20110315 17:01:15 nbsp I recently tried the hot wings at Applebees for the first time.  I was really surprisedthey were excellent.  Very flavorful, very peppery.  Maybe a tiny bit on the oily/greasy side, but it was very slight.  The sauce was deliciousI got the hot buffalo which is hot as a habanero according to the menu.  Dont be fooledits no hotter than a typical Buffalo sauce, but quite delicious. Users/TomGarberson

20110330 21:38:16 nbsp Went there for the endless soup and salad last week.  I liked it but for some reason it took them a very very long time to get our food out.  COME ON its only soup and salad.  I dunno what happens in the kitchen because i have never worked in a restaurant before but im just thinking the soup and salad must be made in a mass quantity and all the waitress needed to do was to scoop it up onto the bowl and plate.  maybe they wanted us to get full from the bread sticks or something.

20110517 22:20:59 nbsp Always great service here, though can be slow sometimes at night. Thats fine by me, if I drop in near midnight I expect things to lag a bit. The new (by Davis standards) manager seems to be doing a great job. Ive talked to him a few times and have been consistently impressed with his proactivity.

As to the food, its what one should expect from a chain restaurant of this sort. Nothing particularly impressive, a little expensive, but rather convenient. Ive never had any bad food, and Im rather hooked on their salads.

Ive probably eaten at Applebees more often than anyone in town who doesnt work there... because MY work shares their parking lot, of course! Its really nice to be able to grab something when Im starving during work and nothings open when I get done except fast food, IHOP, or Applebees. I dont do nonInnOut fast food and, sorry, but I work at a hotel that serves breakfast every day. I cant stand the smell of waffles and pancakes these days. That leaves Applebees. Luckily Ive never left there disappointed.

That said, I dont understand most of the complaints in here. Its not some artisinal bistro. Get over it. Users/KBathory

20130412 22:27:51 nbsp I work at Applebees and the comments on this page may seem disheartening but its a fact that people dont typically leave comments when theyve had a good experience. Only people whove been the unlucky ones. I work here and I still eat here everyday. Food is great, servers are fun, efficient, and knowledgeable. Come by and give us a try. My name is Stephanie. Ask for me if youre visiting in the early afternoon :) Users/StephanieCall
