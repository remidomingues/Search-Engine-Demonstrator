Applied Physics is a majors major offered by the UC Davis Physics physics department.  There are six concentrations to choose from: Computational Physics, Chemical Physics, Materials Science, Physical Oceanography, Atmospheric Physics, and Geophysics.  Many of these may be similar to other UC Davis majors, but are aimed from a physical perspective.  For instance, the chemistry department also offers a degree in Chemical Physics, but the chemistry degree requires more chemistry, while the physics degree requires more physics.
