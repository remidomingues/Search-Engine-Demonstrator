The Department of Applied Science had a long history. It http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/ucd/ucddepartmentshutteredasmorebudgetcutsloom/ got the ax and was closed July 1, 2011 as a cost saving measure.

One of its former chairs was Edward Teller.

Many of the undergraduate optics majors are involved in the Optics Club, a student chapter of both SPIE and OSA.

The Department of Applied Science has had a longstanding relationship with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  In fact, Applied Science even has a building at the lab: Hertz Hall.  Some of the professors have their own research labs in Livermore.  This is actually why the prefix for Applied Science classes is EAD: Engineering Applied Science Davis.  They used to teach classes in Livermore with the prefix EAL: Engineering Applied Science Livermore.  To the best of this writers knowledge, this is no longer done.

Majors
Computational Applied Science
The Computational Applied Science major focuses on the modeling of physical and engineering problems and numerical techniques for solving these problems.  This is a really new major that has not yet had its first graduating class.  Computational Applied Science is also offered as a minor. If you think this major sounds interesting, you should take EAD 2, Introduction to Applied Computational Science and Engineering.  This is a fourunit course offered in spring quarter.
Optical Science and Engineering Major Program
The Optical Science and Engineering major focuses on technology dealing with light.  This includes lasers, spectroscopy, fiber optic communications, imaging systems, and holography.  Graduates of the program have gone on to graduate school in optics, electrical engineering, and applied physics.  Many have also gone into industry at such companies as Northrup Grumman, Tinsley Labs, Zygo, JDS Uniphase, and Accenture.
Contrary to popular belief, optical engineering majors, with the rare exception, do not want to be optometrists or ophthalmologists.  If you want to go into one of these professions, you would probably be better off with a major that actually satisfies premed requirements.  The introductory class for this major is EAD 1, Optical Science and Engineering.  It is a four unit class offered in fall quarter.
