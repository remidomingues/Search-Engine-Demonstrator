These are student perspectives on the courses in Applied Science (EAD).  Optics majors also take many of their classes from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, so check out the ECE course Reviews as well.

 Optical Engineering Courses 

 1. Optical Science and Engineering 
This is generally taught seminar style.  Its not particularly difficult, and you get to learn all about what optical engineers actually do.  (Hint: not laser eye surgery.)

 108A. Optics I 
Geometric optics.  Lenses, ray tracing, aberrations, etc.  Lots of geometry.

 108B. Optics II 
Wave Optics.  Transmission, diffraction, etc.  More E&M than 108A.

 161. Optical Design 
Senior design project, though nothing stops you from taking it as a junior.  This is going to be turned into a twoquarter series, which is good since ten weeks wasnt really enough to accomplish as much as we wanted to.

 165. Statistical and Quantum Optics 
I hope you remember some of PChemistry Chem.  This material is pretty hard conceptually.

 166. Lasers and Nonlinear Optics 
What selfrespecting optics major doesnt love lasers?

 167. Fourier Optics 
The homework assignments take a lot of time, but start early.  Ive heard that this is really important material if youre going on to graduate school.

 170. Optical Spectroscopy: Concepts and Instrumentation 
Learn a lot about NIST.  If you take this with McCurdy, he likes to go off on tangents that turn out to be really interesting.
