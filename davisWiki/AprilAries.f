I moved to Davis with my fiancé in September 2007.
We are both vegan & have been pleasantly surprised by all that Davis has to offer.

re: Cash, credit for orders $5.00+ (Thats illegal!!!)  Is it illegal? I see small businesses all over Davis that have a minimum amount required for CC charges.Users/AprilAries
    The major credit card companies (Visa, Master Card, etc) prohibit a minimum purchase requirement.  They are not supposed to do that under the terms of their contract as a merchant (http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/20010418a.asp link, http://blog.creditorweb.com/index.php/2007/12/13/visaminimumpurchaserequirementsnotallowed/ link).   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
      In addition, theres a code in California that makes it illegal for any place to charge extra or add a fee to a credit card purchase. IE, no +penalty pricing.  However, it is legal to offer discounts for the purpose of inducing payment by cash, check, or other means not involving the use of a credit card.  In brief summation: if they take visa, they should accept it without fee whether you want to charge 30 cents or 30 dollars.
   Theres a wikipage with all this info and some places listed: Credit Card Minimum Purchase

20090406 14:55:13 nbsp Thanks for the info. I had no idea it wasnt allowed. However, I can understand why some small businesses would want to set a minimum purchase amount though. I only asked if it was illegal because someone wrote Thats illegal! on Café Méditerranées page. It seemed odd to single them out when Ive seen minimum purchase requirements at lots of places.
