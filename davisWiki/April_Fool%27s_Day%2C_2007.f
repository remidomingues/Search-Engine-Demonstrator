 The Stage is Set 

We made the wiki look like it did when it was first started years ago on Users/PhilipNeustroms laptop.  See Wiki History for http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_History?actionFiles&doview&targetlaptop.png a screenshot to compare against!  Everything looked primitive and...awful.

Not only were edit controls hard to find, but the lack of a search bar drove some to frustration.

 The Curtain Rises on Our Stage 

On March 14th, Users/JabberWokky approached Users/JasonAller about a few April Fools Day ideas.  The second was to reveal to the world that they were, in fact, the same person.  Very quickly Users/PhilipNeustrom was involved and the plan became a day long slowly escalating event wherein admins would be banned, user entries would be vandalized, and various editors would have utter meltdowns.

Key to this is that for much of the time that JabberWokky has been editing the wiki he has not been present physically in California, even though he is still here in spirit. As such few people have physically met JabberWokky which left open the possibility that he was a sock puppet for the oft bearded and unphotographed Jason. The recent emergence of the Philip Neustrom Theory page gave the opportunity to make fun of taking edit counts as a strict measure of worth, and a gave a place to start the whole thing off.


This was born... The Banninating.  Or Braninating, if youre Users/GrahamFreeman Graham Freeman.

 
>Act One<
>wherein the rumblings of strife foreshadow the coming storm<

The day started off with a beautiful morning.  Flowers were in the air, the smell of birds on the wind... and http://daviswiki.org/Philip_Neustrom_Theory?actiondiff&version233&version126 a flame war was going on about stats.  It started when JabberWokky uploaded a graph and asserted that he would get to 10,000 edits before Jason or Philip.  The argument quickly devolved into arguments over what constituted legitimate edits, and ended with a http://daviswiki.org/JabberWokky?actionFiles&doview&targetJabberWokkys_Contribution.JPG fecal photo (warning: icky photo) resulting in Jason being banned, his user entry in an http://daviswiki.org/JasonAller?actionrecall&version314 odd state.

With the stage set, the players stepped into the shadows for the second phase.  It should be noted that Users/JessicaLuedtke and Users/BrentLaabs contacted Jason and JabberWokky at this point to acknowledge the prank.  Nobody stepped forward to defend Jason (which we had thought would occur), so the early afternoon progressed without further controversy.

>Act Two<
>wherein subtlety is the name of the game<

In the early evening, JabberWokky started posting very Jasonesque entries, including memorial plaques and Sue Christoffersen Bench memorial benches.  Then JabberWokky resumed more typical edits, linking and formatting... but from a Davis IP.  We figured somebody would notice for sure, but as time went on, we had to call upon Users/BrentLaabs to step up on stage.  At this point, Jason, Philip and Jabber were in #dw41 on IRC.

     You there, you want to be Victim #2?   Get on stage!  Okay, wear this hat, take this script and walk through that door when I say What link through yonder entry breaks?

Brent proceeded to change football to soccer several times on the illustrious Toilet Papering page, which eventually translated into a flame war between the two.  Both accused the other of not being in Davis, and this fight finally escalated to the page Petition to Ban Brent Laabs (a reference to Ban Steven Ostrowski).  This page was renamed to Petition to Get Stick out of Jabber Wokkys Ass, and with a dash of nazi furries, Brent was banned for being a sockpuppet of Jason Aller.

>Act Three<
>wherein every editor jumps on the pile and Philip raises the hammer<

...fill er out...

Philip may have made the best single edit comment in DavisWiki history with: banned JabberWokky.hes same person as JasonAller, who was banned by JabberWokky.  He then explained in BannedGroup/Talk:

  Okay, I sort of let this go for a long while, as Ive had private conversations with both JasonAller and JabberWokky. When I first confronted JasonAller about the issue — that it appears JasonAller and JabberWokky are indeed the same person — he remarked that it was simply a mistake. Over the course of a couple weeks of discussion with him he came to admit that he believes he has a case of a spilt personally.

  Now, I hadnt seen it get in the way until now, so I sort of let it go. But its gone way, way too far. Seeing as JasonAller has been banned, it only makes sense to ban his sockpuppet, JabberWokky. They are, in fact, the same person. Its really easy to see by looking at their IP addresses, etc.

  Users/JessicaLuedtke added: Ive long been convinced JabberWokky doesnt really exist, as Ive never met him in real life. I have, however, met JasonAller. I believe you are correct.

>Act Four<
>wherein the king yells Gangbang!<

A flurry of edits followed, including:
   Users/JessicaLuedtke hilariously labeled All Things Right And Relevant with a relevance tag, and disputed UC Davis as being irrelevant due to being outside city limits.  It was shortly seconded by Users/JosephBleckman who promptly deleted it.  The entry, not the campus.
  Users/PhilipNeustrom questioned the relevance of Stub.

 Our apologies to anyone who didnt look 
 at the calendar and see that it was April Fools Day! 


20070402 00:39:14 nbsp Admin wars and inside jokes. Hilarious. Users/AndrewChen
  Hilarious like a car crash, or like a three legged dog? Users/TravisGrathwell

20070402 00:56:14 nbsp Ill admit, you had me (and probably at least half of the other Wikizens observing what was going on) fooled.  That Front Page was a 180degree turn from the true format in terms of user friendliness and organization.  A joke wellexecuted, I must say, but its nice to have the old format back, as well as clarification that Users/JabberWokky and Users/JasonAller are, in fact, different people. Users/LeonardMarque

20070402 01:49:02 nbsp HHRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SNORRRRRK BWAAAAAAAAAA HAHAHAHAHAAHA!!

Sweetness. Users/KarlMogel

20070402 06:29:05 nbsp I almost reverted JWs page to the fecal photo yesterday afternoon.  That was a classic! Users/DavidGrundler

20070402 07:21:49 nbsp This page has no relevance to Davis.  Vote for deletion. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070402 14:38:42 nbsp Man, I missed all the fun.  I just saw the deleted pages Proposal to Ban BrentLaabs, et. al.  What a crackup. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20070402 14:51:12 nbsp Still checking the April Fools edits, and still laughing. Way better than the idea I cooked up, which didnt have time to implement, and wouldnt have been as funny here as on wikispot. Users/KarlMogel

20070402 16:01:13 nbsp In the morning, I thought someone had hacked the wiki as an April Fools joke. I visited again later when the banning was beginning and thought it was YOUR April Fools prank. Then I visited later and had doubts again  I thought that maybe you guys were having problems executing it and that the annoyances were serious. Then I changed my mind again and realized... no, no, it definitely has to be a prank. (Yes, I can be naive sometimes.) It was fun to watch, especially nearing midnight. My favorite part was when Jessica marked UC Davis as irrelevant and Joseph deleted it.  Users/NumiaCairaguas

20070402 18:18:35 nbsp I took a look at the layout and instantly realized it was April fools day, but good work Users/StevenDaubert

20070405 16:39:18 nbsp haha you guys had me fooled for a small bit.  But even after i realized it was a prank i still wanted my search bar back. Users/MattHh

20070412 02:38:04 nbsp Philip, I thought we had this figured out last year  what happened to our magnificent secret plan? Users/ChristopherMckenzie
    Philip was busy working on April 2007 Wiki Update Really Big Things.  Its a testament to his sense of humor that he lent a hand to this years events at all. Users/JabberWokky jw
    I think we need a secret page on the wiki where we have a list of a bunch of ideas so theyre never forgotten :)  Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Under the new system we can do that with security settings. Yay ~DavePoole

20070412 19:19:19 nbsp Was the fact that the random page was always Xanga a statment of some variety? Users/CraigFergus
