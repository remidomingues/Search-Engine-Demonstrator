Welcome to the Wiki Goodbye! You are now leaving the community wiki for Davis, California, USA!  This is the final page on the Wiki.  You must turn around and go back to see the rest of the Wiki.  This project was an interconnected Wiki Community community effort to explore, discuss and compile anything and everything about Davis  especially the big, irritating things. This entire site was maintained by the people who used it: Anyone could have edited this website!  We hope you enjoyed your stay.

If youre new, you should have checked out the Introduction.  Or perhaps tried reading a random page: RandomPage  But do you listen to directions?  No.

Davis Wiki has been part of the local community Wiki History for over five years and is a April 2007 Wiki Update founding site of the wiki:wikispot Wiki Spot project, which provides a home and interconnectivity for all kinds of wiki projects.  Welcome to the wiki Goodbye from the wiki!  Dont you wish you spent more time Wiki/April Fools Day, 2010/You could have explored here?



##   Community Alerts
##  Before enabling a community alert consider if it would be better as a Featured Page or Event.  Community alerts are ultrahigh profile emergency notices regarding very time sensitive and temporary items such as boil water orders, weather alerts or a missing child.  Try to keep them limited to items that the people living in Davis should all be alerted to, no matter who they are.  Think of it as the Wiki emergency broadcast system.
## To Enable a community alert, use:
##Include(Community Alert, Community Alert, left, 48%)Include(Featured Page, Featured Page, right)
## Otherwise, use:

##Include(Featured Page, Featured Page, right)
##Include(Election Results, Election Results, right)

 Hints for Editing 
A good place to start was by checking out the Davis Wiki Guide.

A Wiki is a linked set of pages that anybody can edit and contribute to if they have the time, access to internet, and a computer.  wiki:WikiPedia: Wikipedia is the prime example of a successful wiki project.  Also, check out wiki:Wiki:WhyWikiWorks Why Wiki Works for some information on the philosophy of wiki.

If you want to practice editing you can play around in the Wiki Sand Box, or you may first want to check out our FAQ.  We also have a list of All Pages in the wiki.

Feel free to come back some time and make new pages  and try to remember to link them.  Also, if you dont know where to start or dont have any ideas, check out To Do.

To see the most recent edits made you could have looked at the Recent Changes page. Also, we hope you checked your userpage as people might have left you comments on there.
