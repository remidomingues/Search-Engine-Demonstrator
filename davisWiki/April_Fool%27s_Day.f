In the grand internet tradition of altering websites on the first of April, the Davis Wiki changes each year to a bizarre reinterpretation of itself.  Familiar editors also mockingly quit or change their personal pages to strange antiversions of their profile.

So far there have been:

  2005  Wiki/April Fools Day, 2005 The MSN Buyout
  2006  Wiki/April Fools Day, 2006 The MySpace Spoof
  2007  Wiki/April Fools Day, 2007 The Edit Count Banning (Branning), and CSS
  2008  Wiki/April Fools Day, 2008 Domain loss and vandals
  2010  Wiki/April Fools Day, 2010 The Front Page is the Back Page
  2011  ǝbɐd ʇuoɹɟ
