The Davis Aquadarts Swim Team  is Davis competitive youth Swimming swim team and has a history of being one of the finest teams in Sierra Nevada swimming. The Aquadarts receive coached swim sessions at three area pools: Civic Center Pool, Manor Pool and Community Pool. Both morning and afterschool practice sessions are held around typical K12 school hours, and various age groups meet between three and nine times per week. The youngest Aquadarts are third grade and below, while the oldest Aquadarts are in high school; beyond that, swimmers will probably enter the Davis Aquatic Masters program.

Because this is a competitive swim team, the schedule is also arranged around competition seasons  visit their website for more information on seasons. Aquadart families are also required to participate in fundraising efforts and contribute a minimum number of volunteer service hours in addition to paying membership dues.
