Laurie Loving, M.S.W., is certified as a Watsu Practitioner by the Worldwide Aquatic Bodyworkers Association. She trained in massage at the Massage Therapy Institute in Davis. Aquatic bodywork relieves her own symptoms from fibromyalgia, a pain and fatigue syndrome. Her intention is to cocreate with you an environment of safety, trust and healing.

Warm water (96 degrees) relaxes tight muscles and allows your spine and joints to move freely. Clinical studies have shown that Watsu is beneficial for stress relief and chronic pain and stiffness conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, MS, Parkinsons, stroke and more. Recipients love the relief they feel from pain, stiffness and emotional tension.

Services are provided in a 12ft diameter therapy pool in the back yard of a private home in east Davis. The pool is surrounded by a tall, white yurt and tropical plants that adds additional privacy and beauty. The pool is chlorinefree and uses a copperionization system for sparkling, clear water.

The aesthetics, especially at sundown, are as beautiful and relaxing as the rest of the treatment. Thank you!! Users/NatalieBenjamin
