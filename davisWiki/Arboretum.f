According the http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/ official UC Davis Arboretum site, the UC Davis Arboretum (Known as The Arb to some locals) is:

     a living Museums museum
     an outdoor classroom
     a public garden with over 2,400 kinds of trees and plants
     a beautiful place for active recreation or peaceful contemplation

Might I also add:
     a romantic place to take a Good Ideas For Dates date on an evening walk
     a great place to unwind and relax
     an area to get some fresh air and exercise
     one of the best picnic spots in all of Davis
     home of the Arboretum Folk Music Jam Session

The UC Davis Arboretum occupies 100 acres of land along the south edge of campus, along the banks of Arboretum Waterway Arboretum Waterway, on the old north channel of Putah Creek. It was established in 1936 to help young biologists at UC Davis learn the plants of California. The paths of the Arboretum make a walking and running loop that is about 3.5 miles long.

For those with an interest in gardening, the plants of California, or local wildlife, the garden has over 31,000 trees and plants. Many of the plants have plant labels or nearby signs, describing the collection. The Arboretum is free and open seven days a week, 365 days a year.

Frequently, guided tours and workshops are offered for the public or special groups. For teachers, there are programs especially designed for student groups. Visits to the UC Davis Arboretum are popular field trips for local K12 schools and community colleges. UC Davis students and faculty also host science cafes, music, theatre performances, readings, or art events in the Arboretum that are open to the public, for free or for very low cost.

Highlights include the Carolee Shields White Flower Garden—designed in the style of the moon viewing gardens in Japan and India that feature white flowers to reflect the light of the full moon, a new Native American Contemplative Garden, which honors the native Patwin people who lived on here, along Putah Creek, and the shady T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove, a grove of coast redwoods that were planted by UC Davis student volunteers in the 1930s.

Although people from the local area and from the entire region enjoy visiting the UC Davis Arboretum for runs, walks, and learning more about gardening, it is also a scientific museum, with nationally important research collections of oaks and acacias. You will often see UC Davis classes or faculty researchers out in the gardens— more than 100 classes on campus use the Arboretum, and it is an busy site for student and faculty research projects about plants, water, and wildlife.

Without gate fees, the UC Davis Arboretum depends on community support. The http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/join_the_friends.aspx Friends of the Davis Arboretum is made up of supporters of the Arboretum. Since the 1970s, the Friends— who came together to protect the Arboretum, after all funding to the garden was cut and all staff were laid off during a UC Davis budget crisis— have been hosting fundraising plant sales in the spring and fall, and organizing volunteers who work together with the staff all year in weekly teams or as part of large, onetime community work days to keep the Arboretum gardens, nursery, events, and office tasks running smoothly.

 Arboretum Waterway The Waterway 


For the most part, the entire Arboretum Waterway Arboretum waterway is 4 feet deep from one end to the other. All storm water runoff from the main
campus enters the waterway and incidental runoff from landscape irrigation is the only other source of inflow. The waterway holds about 11 million gallons of water and is about 10 acres in area. It was constructed in 1969 along the historic channel of the North Fork of Putah Creek.

Some areas, like Lake Spafford (location: 38.3215N by 121.4449W) were widened to create some variation in the waterway.
F. Edwin Spafford served as ASUCD President in 1953 and he made many lasting contributions to the University of California and
to the Davis campus from 1954 until his retirement in 1987. His wife, Lois Spafford gave $20,000 to establish the Ed and Lois Spafford Endowed Arboretum Maintenance Fund and the lake was named in Ed Spaffords honor.

There is a working Arboretum Boathouse boathouse at the body of water west of Putah Creek Lodge.

 The Plant Collections 


The collections include over 31,000 plants adapted to a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The 2,421 taxa in the collection represent 156 plant families that are arranged in a series of gardens from different geographic areas, plant groups, or horticultural themes. The plants in the Arboretum are maintained by Arboretum staff members in combination with over 200 active http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/volunteer.aspx volunteers.

 Animal life 

Some of the animals that can be spotted in the arboretum include: Butterflies & Moths butterflies, ducks, frogs, Canada Geese geese, cormorants, Raptors raptors (hawks), peacocks, herons & egrets, rabbits, squirrels, fish, Honeybees bees, and turtles. See also: Town Wildlife


One omnipresent creature in the arboretum area (and the nearby sections of Davis and the UC Davis campus) is the Ducks Mallard duck. The ducks feed on grubs in the grassy areas surrounding the waterways of the arboretum and on the scummy substance that lines the bottom of the waterways. If grubs and scum were all the ducks had to feed upon, there would be quite a few less of them (see the page on Ducks for info on overfeeding).



In the spring of 2010 some North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) took up residence in the Arboretum waterway, to the surprise and delight of visitors. Their presence in the waterway is a bit of a mystery, since it is a closed body of water. Look for them near the Native American Contemplative Garden and the Acacia Collection Eric E. Conn Acacia Collection where they have been seen playing and swimming.

They schlep across a fence and at least 40 feet to go from North Davis drainage pond to North Davis pond, so anything is possible Daubert


 What to do there 
Arboretum paths are popular with Walking Distance walkers, joggers, and Bicycling bicyclists. The main path is a 3.5 mile loop. The lawns at the west end near the Shields Oak Grove Peter J. Shields Oak Grove are perfect for informal games and picnics. Picnic tables are located behind Putah Creek Lodge and in the T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove. ValleyWise Garden The Storer Garden and Arboretum Gazebo White Flower Garden at the west end of the Arboretum and the  Arboretum Terrace Arboretum Terrace Garden at the east end are level and most easily accessible to wheelchairs and people with limited mobility.

Most of the arboretum is not lit by streetlights at night, but crime in the Davis area is rare and the arboretum is, generally speaking,a safe place to spend time, even after dark.  With the arboretums connection to the South Davis Bike Path, it makes a useful bikefriendly route to thecore of the Campus UC Davis campus from South Davis.

The Arboretums public education programs include guided tours, family nature programs, talks by artists, scholars, and scientists, music and theater performances, classes and workshops. Check the http://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/calendar.aspx calendar on the Arboretum website for details.

UC Daviss annual Picnic Day holds one major event in the arboretum: the Picnic Day Battle Of The Bands.  Not to be missed!

20081222 14:47:30 nbsp The arboretum is very pretty but they have a sign for every single redbud tree, while many other species go unnamed.  Why is this? Users/tierramor
  The redbud collection (one of the largest in the country) was named in honor of Arboretum superintendent Warren G. Roberts Redbud Collection Warren Roberts just a couple of years ago, I think.  The signs were likely placed in conjunction with that event.  I remember a lot of public interest in the redbuds around that time, too.  Users/DukeMcAdow
