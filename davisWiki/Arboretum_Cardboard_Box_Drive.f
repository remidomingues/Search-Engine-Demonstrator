The Arboretum UC Davis Arboretum needs cardboard boxes for the upcoming October plant sale, especially cardboard flat boxes! If you have boxes to give, know where to find them, or are willing to collect a few for us  wed appreciate the help!

Please message Users/ChristyMarsden, the volunteer coordinating the cardboard collections, if you can help! She can pick them up or drop them off for you (currently, she resides in Casitas, so it may be easier to get to).

All cardboard boxes can be dropped off at the gates of the new nursery, located on La Rue Road across from the Vet Med facilities.
