The Arboretum Nurseries Nursery is managed by the Friends of the UC Davis Arboretum. It is located by VMTH, near the Unitrans yard, north of the Arboretum.

Plant Faire
Occasionally, they have plant sales. You can find flowering plants, herbs, native grasses, desert plants, small trees, orchids, and tons of other nice plants. Most are outdoor, but some do well indoors, too. The people who run the nursery sales will gladly give you advice if you ask for it. Botany club members also help set up the event. The prices are reasonable, members of the Friends of the UC Davis Arboretum receive a 10% discount on plants, at these events the cost of membership is reduced by five dollars and they have a buy one get one free deal. Some local businesses give discounts to cardcarrying Arboretum members.

Public sales are held regularly in the spring and fall. There are membersonly sales before the public sales, but you can join at the door.

Sometimes they need Arboretum Cardboard Box Drive cardboard boxes for plant sales.

 New Location 
In the Spring of 2008 a new location for the nursery was constructed closer to the west end of the arboretum.
