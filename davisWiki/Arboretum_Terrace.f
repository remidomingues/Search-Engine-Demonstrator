The Arboretum Terrace Garden and Lois Crowe Patio is a Mediterraneanstyle garden for Californias Central Valley, featuring vinecovered pergolas, decorative paving, and cooling fountains. Visitors can learn about Valleywise gardening: how to create a beautiful garden, reduce their use of water, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and provide a refuge for birds and butterflies, using Arboretum AllStars plants and garden techniques adapted to local growing conditions. The patio is named for Lois Crowe, an Arboretum docent with a special interest in Mediterranean garden style.

There are plenty of chairs and tables to Study Spots study at. It is sandwiched between E Street and the Train Tracks train tracks. The Arboretum Terrace is especially busy during weekends and on days with nice weather. Kids especially like to play around the fountains.
