Putah Creek is the primary drainage for the Davis area. Putah Creek no longer flows through Campus campus, as the the creek was diverted to the south of Davis. The Waste Water Treatment Plant discharges its effluent into the south branch of Putah Creek.

The segment of the Putah Creek which used to flow through the UC Davis Arboretum, is now called the Arboretum Waterway, and it enhances the beauty of the setting, despite the concrete walls. The waterway runs southwest from the Borders parking lot and Solano Park towards the UC Davis Equestrian Center. Lake Spafford is one of the many sites on this nonflowing section of waterway, near Mrak Hall. Every few years (nope, it was only done once in ~1992), this section of previously natural creek is drained for cleaning, and many Bicycling Tips stolen bicycles are recovered. There are several Arboretum Bridges arboretum bridges and a Arboretum Dock dock.

Many claim that Putah descends from a local Native American word.  However, more amusement is generated from the fact that puta in Spanish means whore.
