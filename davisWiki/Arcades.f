Arcades are something of a dying breed of Videogaming.  Many gamers got their start on arcade games during a time when console based gaming couldnt compare to what you saw in arcades.  As technology progressed however, home gaming became more and more advanced and at the same became less and less expensive.  Sadly, the popularity of home gaming has ultimately killed the arcade industry making arcades an increasingly rare sight for the past 10 years.

Arcade games are still very popular amongst gamers.  Many of the more popular arcade games have been ported over to consoles, many of which are very faithful recreations of the original.  Still, playing arcade games at home doesnt match the feel of a real arcade, with the lights, noise and community of people gathering around someone who is about to beat a game or get to a level youve never even seen before.  You also dont get to see the latest gimmickry in arcade technology such as ridable motorcycles, shooting games and the extremely rare 360 degree flight simulator (http://www.system16.com/sega/hrdw_r360.html Sega R360).

And nothing, but nothing, can match the feeling of when you were seven years old and beat the snot out of some twentysomething in a good fighting game, or blew the doors off someone in a good racing game.  Of course, as you got older and started getting your own butt kicked by kids that were your age, justice was served.

Today it is very hard to find a proper arcade.  Most of the arcade games youll find are in a sad state of disrepair, buttons and joysticks broken and have bad screen burn.  They are often found in a dark corner of a restaurant or (worse) a bar by the bathrooms.

Heres a list of local places that have arcade games.  If you are familiar with the arcade please give a short review of their selection and quality of upkeep.  Please update if you discover more places.

Local Arcades

  MU Games Area  Largest arcade in Davis
  wiki:sacramento:Country Club Lanes in Sacramento
  Scandia Family Fun Center Scandia Family Fun Centers in Sacramento and Fairfield

 The Memorial Union Renewal project, set to begin January 2015, will remove all arcade machines from the MU in lieu of freetoplay (for students) console systems and TVs. Due to a bookstore expansion, there will also be less space for gaming in this area than currently is available. The machines will likely go to the bargain barn around that time, so make sure to get on their listserv if youre interested.

Note: Video Poker poker, et al. is not a proper arcade game.  I would argue against DDR being a proper arcade game but Ill give it a little leeway.

Id love to hear your argument against Dance Dance Revolution DDR being a proper arcade game.  Have you checked out any arcades in Japan recently?  While they have plenty of traditional arcade games, DDR style games are the ones I saw played the most Users/JevanGray Jevan

Yes, I know they love those types of games.  However they became popular towards the end of the arcade era here in the states and arent exactly what I would consider a proper arcade game.  As I said, Ill give them leeway as they are found in many arcades.  I just dont think they fit the description I think of when I think of an arcade game, being 27 years old I grew up going to arcades and saw them come in as all my favorite games were disappearing...  Users/HollywoOd

Video Poker doesnt qualify as an arcade game because it incorporates gambling; DDR is as much an arcade game as your favorite light gun game.  Users/GeoffJohnson Comments

20050219 15:48:12 nbsp I was in junior high during the golden age of arcades. Davis had quite a few places to play, the longestrunning and best being the nowdefunct The Library on G Street. We used to tell our parents we were going to the library like good little kids... heh heh... Now with MAME, PS2, Gamecube, etc., etc. the cabinet games arent gonna come back. Shame... Users/CentralDavisite

20050222 13:34:12 nbsp Yes I remember and loved The Library...however I remember that what is now the Katmandu kitchen used to be a pizza joint and they were the first in town to carry Street Fighter Users/JamesSchwab

20050222 23:30:10 nbsp I never cared for Round Table Pizza (where Kathmandu is now). The video game place on the corner of 3rd and G where the Tibetan store is now had a pretty good selection. There was a tiny arcade in the space where the Hotdogger is now; while the woman that ran it was nice, she didnt have a huge selection (obviously! Tiny space!). I was never big on the martial arts games more on the games of 19791985.  Users/CentralDavisite
20050222 23:31:26 nbsp shouldnt this be called arcades? plural? Users/ArlenAbraham
