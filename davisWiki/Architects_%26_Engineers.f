A&E, or Architects and Engineers is a campus unit that plans and oversees all University Construction. Ironically they are located off campus next to Schilling Robotics. They used to be located on campus just north of EU III.

Their http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu website is really pretty and useful.

They have been improving their construction recycling and have achieved over 50% diversion of construction waste campus wide. The Mathematical Sciences Building has diverted 90% of their waste.

A master list of current construction projects can be found on the http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu/Projweb/ProjectStatus.nsf/MasterProject?OpenView project tracker.  Are any of these LEED certified green buildings?

See also other architects.


How does one calculate the diversion rate for a construction project? Or for all construction on the campus as a whole for that matter? Do remodels count? Does concrete broken out in the site preparation phase count in the total?  Users/JasonAller

20080605 11:09:29 nbsp Oh and by the way, theres lots of architects and engineers in Davis not associated with this group.  A better name might be UCD Architects and Engineers Unit.  Users/JimStewart

20140120 15:03:05 nbsp A&E changed its name to Design and Construction Management some years ago.  Same folks, same location (255 Cousteau Place).  The old website (http://www.ae.ucdavis.edu/index.htm) still exists, and looks to be just an older graphic implementation of the new one (http://dcm.ucdavis.edu/). Users/JimFrame
