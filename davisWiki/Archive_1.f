20050330 17:21:09 nbsp What is the difference between a page ABOUT a business and a page BY a business and obviously geared towards advertising?  How do we (or should we) deal with the later type of page?  I had this question in response to some recent postings, but I just want to see what people have to say about it.  I imagine this will be a more frequent concern as the wiki becomes more well known.  (please forgive if this has been discussed before) Users/CarlMcCabe
    Is this with reference to Chabad? (no Users/CarlMcCabe cm) From my POV (as the guy whos maintaining the Chabad page) Chabad would have a lowtraffic, singlepage presence just about anywhere it set up. As such it makes almost no sense to create a Chabad site anywhere else. I understand the rule that pages arent going to be mouthpieces for a single organization, but its kind of unlikely that Chabad will do anything controversial, so this is almost entirely a moot point. If it does get controversial, and we decide we want a mouthpiece, then Ill figure out about moving the site somewhere where thats not collaboratively edited.  Users/KenBloom
    There is no difference.  A business owner has equal right to edit their entry as you do.  That goes both ways  you can add your views, and they can add theirs.  A couple businesses have been listing specials and deals (one of the cell phone stores updates their deals fairly often).  Thats a good thing  its more information on the Wiki, and constant updating keeps the information current and useful.  If they started deleting bad reviews, they would be behaving as a poor editor (it doesnt require a business owner to do this  Saul deleted a few when he first arrived)... and poor editing often is best combated through education rather than a kneejerk reaction.   Users/JabberWokky
    You make a good point.  I hadnt thought of it like that. Users/CarlMcCabe cm
 20050330 17:32:03 nbsp Im not entirely sure what to do myself.   I myself have used the wiki to advertise different things on campus.  No one owns a page in the wiki, so it can be edited to represent multiple viewpoints.  And most of us Wikivangelists will be able to keep this place from turning into Davis411, so I wouldnt worry.  Just edit what you think is excessively onesided, and hopefully people who have had dealings with the business will come by and add their points of view.

 Of course, another option is to let businesses have home pages, much like the CamelCase pages that pretty much belong to individual users.  That resolved a lot of the issues during the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election. Users/BrentLaabs

 Theyre probably just not aware of the daviswiki, but it amazes me how tolerant businesses have been of negative comments. Ive only been on the Wiki since January, but Ive never seen an instance of a business owner trying to remove something bad. hmmm... maybe I should test the waters by listing where I found a bandaid in a tunafish sandwich? Anyway, due to their controversial and transient nature, dualpagerepresentation made perfect sense for the elections. However, for more stable businesses, I fear that dualrepresentation would clutter and confuse things greatly. Naive searches might lead people only to the biased business owners page rather than the objective community based one. Users/CraigBrozinsky
 20050330 17:43:08 nbsp Businesses can advertise all they want on the page for their business, but content about the business is more important and should be placed higher on the page than the advertisements. Users/MikeIvanov
   Also, like anything, its important to know who is saying what.  Italics, bullets, and sections ({{{ like this }}}) can help.

20050406 14:52:29 nbsp what if some pictures on pages are shitty, whats the policy on changing them to something better? i dont want to get anyones panties in a twist if i replace pictures Users/MattJojola
   the wiki is all about panty twisting Users/ArlenAbraham
   If I took the shitty pictures, feel free to replace them!  Trying to make a page better is almost always a good thing
   feel free to replace my shitty pictures too.  i think a lot of photos were put up just to fill a void.  theres a lot that should be replaced.  and i wear boxers, but youre not allowed to twist them. Users/CarlMcCabe cm

20050424 23:31:55 nbsp Davis Wiki is officially a success!  Why, you ask?  Because someone bought up http://www.daviswiki.com/.  Users/BrentLaabs

20050426 22:47:09 nbsp Very cool new map detail! The only thing that troubles me is that Visor Lady is mapped outside of Griffin Lounge and is clearly infringing on the turf of the Old Guys at the MU. Someone should fix that before a fight breaks out. Users/JackHaskel
   Thats because of increased detail.  Anyone can fix it. :)
    I know, I know. Just thought it was funny in a really nerdy and lame sort of way.

20050514 19:55:45 nbsp Any chance we could get the Wiki Weather weather forecast some nice icons and put it somewhere important?  Its not like the black bar at the top does very much.  But really just a display on the front page would be nice. Users/BrentLaabs

 We were considering adding some weather icons, but if we do that we would rather use a live xml weather feed. Users/MikeIvanov

20050621 20:39:10 nbsp Ive got an etiquette question. When is it ok to create a user page for a user who doesnt have one? How much information is it ok to put on there about them? Is anything already available on the internet fair game to put on pages about people (both user pages and people pages)? Users/JasonAller
  Heres my personal opinion. I avoid putting anything not accessible from a google search, would jeopardize someones job, or isnt observable by any passerby. Also, for people whos usernames are aliases, consider that they might be using aliases to protect their anonymity. You might want to ask those folks if its okay first. Using these rules, Ive avoided putting anything about Users/BarnabasTruman or anything that would embarrass any of my colleagues in the Psychology. Ive also refrained from putting the last name of Visor Lady. Well, actually I dont know her full name, but if I did, I wouldnt write it.

20050706 23:23:29 nbsp Um, just curious what people think.  Users/SchminkerTons has Do not edit this page on his user page.  That seems sorta bizarre and counter to the purpose of wikiwiki.  Candidate for speedy deletion? Users/BrentLaabs
 20050707 01:30:32 nbsp Its a personal page, so I dont see a point in deleting it.  Probably just a joke, anyway.  Who cares? Users/MikeIvanov

20050708 18:54:26 nbsp Someone wrote a Firefox search extension a while back (I cant seem to find it anymore.) If that person is still around, could they perhaps write a similar extension to search ucdavis.edu? Users/MarkWetter

20050714 13:45:19 nbsp So, subpages can be denoted by the name Original Page/Sub page name.  Then, you can write {{{/Sub page name}}} as a shortcut to the longer page name of {{{Original page/Sub page name}}}  Ive noticed that were sort of using this as the naming convention for sub pages, and we used to use a colon ({{{stuff: other stuff}}}).  For talk pages, which we seem to be moving to in some cases, should they be named {{{Talk/Original page name}}} or {{{Original page name/Talk}}}? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050724 21:17:16 nbsp While it is great that people are putting so much work into cleaning up Wanted Pages, is it really a good idea to put up a page with very little or no useful information simply for the sake of getting it off Wanted Pages? The problem with this is that its a lot less likely that someone who actually has knowledge of or interest in researching the subject will notice that the information is needed. If we do continue eliminating wanted pages in this manner, perhaps adding a statement including the word stub would be useful so that people can easily search for pages that need to be filled out. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20050724 21:20:12 nbsp From what Ive seen people are quick to start adding new stuff or shooting down my pages. From there you can tell what pages really are wanted or not. Users/JimSchwab
 20050724 22:49:43 nbsp At Jim:  Those of us who have been around the wiki long enough know if a page already exists or not, which is why were pretty quick on editing/killing new entries.  Youll be that way soon enough, Im sure  especially because you have an excellent knowledge of Davis history growing up here and all.
 At Phil:  Id like to see {{{../Subpage}}} implemented so its easy to link between subpages on the same level.  This was sort of an issue with all of the ASUCD Elections pages. Users/BrentLaabs

20050727 22:05:46 nbsp Theres an increasing trend to use the events board for repeating events.  This has the plus of showing up in my xml feed when sometimes i wish i knew what there was to do tonight in terms of both repeating and nonrepeating events in one list.  however, obviously that is the exception rather than rule.  However, the rule doesnt seem to be enforced.  Any thoughts? Users/JaimeRaba
  2006105 Okay, this is a very late addition to this discussion, but I noticed the same thing today, especially the addition of several very large images. For example, the Grad has posted the same large image on a weekly basis. How about a pixel size limit to events postings, e.g. please thumbnail images or something? It makes it very difficult to scroll through the events listing as a user when KDVS for which I have the utmost respect posts half a dozen large band images. Users/Alphadog

On 8.24.05 I cleaned out some Talk pages for entries that had become stable.  Since the format for Talk pages has changed, here are the missing entries should they be needed in the future:

Talk:Traditions, Talk:Ben & Jerrys, Talk:Ari Kalfayan, Talk:Gender and Sexuality Commission, Talk:Davis Players Society

20050826 14:25:12 nbsp Does anyone object to changing the purpose of the mystery page to include the question of what. It seems there are plenty of things people see around town that are really anomalous (flowers, people, etc.). This could also encourage wiki contributions that would otherwise have been avoided due to lack of namage. Users/CraigBrozinsky
 Is this covered by or identify its contents? Users/ArlenAbraham

20050826 nbsp (discussion moved here from Davis Farmers Market)

I do not want to delete them, because I am not 100% certain, but I do not think you can post pictures of children on the internet without their parents permission. Anyone know? Users/JimSchwab

 I would say maybe the one with three little boys would be questioning, if that were true. The other one you cant see their faces. Users/MichelleAccurso

 I occasionally work as an escort for the Planned Parenthood clinic, walking clients and staff in and out of the building. The protesters use to take pictures of the children, until the police came and told them not too. I have no idea what they would do with the pics, but the pics they took of me, well they put those on the internet. Maybe one of our expert lawyers will know. Users/JimSchwab

  it is completely legal to take pictures of people in PUBLIC places and post them without their permission. And anyway, think of it from a practical viewpoint...whats the worry? That some child molester knows that boys, without any identifying information, sometimes congregate at the Farmers Market? Is that something he/she needed DavisWiki to find out?  Users/ApolloStumpy

 I think the law is different for children, I believe you need there parents permission. I just dont want Phillip or Mike to get in trouble. Users/Jimschwab

 Think of the absurdity of such a law. Everytime you take a picture at a public place, youd have to make sure that no children unrelated to you were in the frame, or else you could never distribute that picture over the internet. Think about newspaper coverage of events...do you honestly think that the photographer went out and got every single parents permission for every child who appeared in a parade photograph? There is no such law. If people dont want it to be known that their kids go to public events, then dont take them there.  AS

  I may be talking about an old topic, but Ill add some information on this. Im a professional photographer, and the laws in the USA are something I know a bit about. As long as you are standing on publicly accessible ground, you can photograph whatever or whoever you like, and you do not need permission from parents, children, etc. There are two exceptions to this. First, you cannot take a photograph of someone, if that person has what is called reasonable expectation of privacy. This means it is not acceptable to use a telephoto lens to photograph someone through their bedroom window. Similarly, if a child were having its diapers changed, and the parents were attempting, reasonably, to shield the child from view, it would be considered a private moment and is therefore protected. On the other hand, a naked child running around in a fountain would be fair game for the photographer. The second exception to public photography is that, in some cases, it is illegal to photograph nuclear power facilities or military installations. Odd, but true. Anyway, I provide this information for you because, in this era of heightened concerns about security, photographers are being told more and more that they are not allowed to do what they are indeed allowed to do. For more information on this, you can refer to the http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm Photographers Bill of Rights; I keep a copy of this in each one of my camera bags.Users/BarryRice


20050914 12:53:23 nbsp I think that it is sad how brainwashed we have become in our worship of copyright law. Must we all cow down whenever congress decides to change it because it helps some corporation? With the current climate, the public (or even private) library never could come into existance! Users/SteveDavison
  We chose http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ the most liberal creative commons license to put all of Davis Wiki under.  We say, on the bottom of every page, Everything you see (unless noted otherwise) is under this liberal license, and this means you can do anything with it as long as you credit the source to davis wiki/specific author.  Many other places restrict their content in such a way that it cannot be placed on Davis Wiki unless we note that it falls under a different, more restrictive license (such as use this for whatever as long as you dont make money off of it).  Otherwise wed be telling people Hey, this image from the california aggie can be used for whatever purpose and in any way, because we say its under the superliberal license unless we state otherwise.  Stating otherwise can be annoying, but its necessary othewise the integrity of our resource  as a free resource for all to use in any way  becomes suspect.

  As for contributing outright copyrighted material with no usage license at all and without permission:  that can only be here as long as its considered fair use of the material under US law.

  By putting everything on Davis Wiki under such a liberal license we allow an amazing amount of usage.  Talk about usage of material on Davis Wiki is a part of keeping the resource free. Users/PhilipNeustrom

    That was my frustration with the current state of copyright law and how things that were historically in the public commons have been coopted by corporate interests, not a suggestion that we not follow the law. I have no complaint with the Creative Commons license, or with Davis Wiki. This is a topic that could be discussed for some time. Users/SteveDavison

20050918 23:35:28 nbsp as long as ive been on the wiki, people have been responsible in what they post and have reverted stuff they deemed inappropriate. what were to happen if someone were to post a really inappropriate thing to the wiki. something that would be harmful to find even in the pages history. for instance, some celebritys phone number, the answers to an exam, Libel libelous info intended to inflict harm on an individual, outing someone, etc? has that ever happened on here or on other wikis, and what is the policy should it happen? Users/CraigBrozinsky
  What do you think it should be?  Most of the time courts rule that those who provide services are not necessarily responsible for those who use them.  So, this would be a case in which it was clear that there is a misuse and the nonremoval of something is deemed a violation of some law or another? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  I was thinking in terms of moral obligation rather than legal obligation. In either case, I dont have a clear answer. On the one hand, its easy to intellectualize the Wiki as a noholdsbarred freespeech tool. On the other hand, when things become personal, I think a lot of people would want material permanently removed. Users/CraigBrozinsky cb
  I probably shouldnt note this, but if you edit a page >100 times (see http://www.daviswiki.org/ASUCD_Senate?actioninfo this one, some of the history appears to be lost.  This may not actually be the case.  You can also do fun stuff with combinations of moves, deletes and reverts that I havent been able to recover info from, but those might have been fixed.  Users/BrentLaabs
    The history isnt lost, its just not displayed (yet).  As for any combination of deleting and renaming, let me know if there are any problems in this respect from now on (because there shouldnt be). Users/PhilipNeustrom
  The >100 edit bug has been fixed. There will be a memory hole feature in the next software update. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050925 12:13:38 nbsp Was just looking at some of the recent Hoa Viet revision wars. I feel that we should have factual content, positive and negative, on the top part of the page and then in the Comments section, opinions (positive and negative) should follow. I propose these as guidelines about what content goes where. The great thing about the Wiki is that we can see the good, bad, and ugly. I do want to see the GOOD as well as the BAD. Users/SteveDavison
  You should fix it, then!  I think it was reverted because something was deleted that someone thought valuable without being integrated elsewhere in the page? Users/PhilipNeustrom
    The Hoa Viet page got me thinking about what the proper thing to do would be; it was just an example. I felt there was no need for me to jump into the fray. My point above was to recommend factsaboveComments/OpinionbelowComments as a basic style goal.

20051015 00:59:43 nbsp shrug... I dont think the Bistro 33 page would seem so bad if it was just reorganized and cleaned up a bit.  There is just a lot of crap on the page currently... for example the multiple comments all dealing with the http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/09/30/FrontPage/NewBistro.Has.Old.Problems1321175.shtml candlestick incident that take up almost 20 lines could be greatly pared down or possibly even removed completely.  The offtopic comments could be removed and the informational ones could be worked into the pages body text.  Thatd do a lot to help right there, though itd still leave a bunch of reviews/user experiences.  But I dont think its that bad for a page to have lots of review like comments, as long as theyre in the proper place (ie: after all the factual informational stuff).  I dont think length alone should determine the necessity of a talk page. Users/JevanGray

20051020 06:24:17 nbsp Just a general musing: Ive observed several times how 1) Someone sees a need and  adds to a page or creates a new page), 2) Others see it in Recent Changes, then jump on it and edit it, 3) the original intent is lost and the content veers off into something unrecognizable, 4) the page is deleted as having no merit taking the meritorious original seed with it. The subject is much larger than Wiki, it is one of group dynamics, and a worthy subject of study. Users/SteveDavison

20051029 16:23:25 nbsp I can imagine the day, not far off, when every business in Davis has a page here. Users/SteveDavison

20051029 16:26:24 nbsp Something Ive been thinking about: Would it make sense to have task groups which might meet, plan a page (perhaps one requiring indepth research) and create it? In other words, folks that might get together for a project vs. everyone just doing their own? Users/SteveDavison

20051114 02:48:34 nbsp Question: What do you guys think about Craigs idea to create pages, CraigBrozinsky:RestaurantReviewsstyle pages that mirror the content of Restaurants but with personal opinions. Is this something the community wants more of? I.E Arlen:RestaurantReview, Neustrom:Reviews, etc?
 Michael, you bring up a good point, and I should clarify that I was somewhat conflicted in making that page. On the one hand, my review page isnt something thats set up to be edited by others, comments section aside. Thats makes it admittedly unwikilike, and im 100% open to comments for the pages continuation or removal. On the one hand, I felt it useful because I make enough restaurant comments to warrant some kind of a calibration and summary page. Im harsh (but fair) on lots of reviews, and I find it useful for people to understand thats a general bias on my part. Also, Im hesitant to leave a vague comment such as i liked it or eh, okay or an overly smarmy comment on a page if I dont have more evidence to back it up. Finally, with regards to one of my particularly nasty reviews, I felt that putting the info on the individual page was largely a historical point, and would do more damage to the business than was really fair. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051125  Just noticed the Wiki is listed on an http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/Current/ official UC Davis web site. In fact, its the only nonucdavis resource listed, I take that as an acknowledgment of accomplishment. Users/SteveDavison

20051214 11:01:13 nbsp recently, there seems to be a lot of strange editing behavior on the wiki. where would be a good place to discourage wiki:WikiPedia:Sock_puppet sock puppets? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051223 11:22:50 nbsp The Davis Wiki needs to have a vision statement; a sense of what it should become. Perhaps a steering committee which would meet regularly and evaluate the current state and future goals. (Im just floating ideas for thoughts & feedback.) Users/SteveDavison
  Other than for code development or socializing, what would be the purpose? i may be misinterpreting your suggestions, but i kind of like the way things are no bureaucracy, no explicit group of people making decisions for the rest, and a generally laid back attitude.  Users/CraigBrozinsky
    I think you are misinterpreting me slightly. All I am suggesting is that we discuss the future rather than just blindly waiting. As far as no explicit group of people making decisions, thats already not the case: there is an explicit group who know the root password. Making it 100% democratic is probably undesirable. Users/SteveDavison
  Philip and I have discussed this, and neither of us think its a good idea to put the wiki into the hands of any sort of committee.  We have discussed our vision and goals, but its probably not such a good idea to try to steer something like the wiki, but we tried to point it in a positive direction to start with. Users/MikeIvanov
    It doesnt have to be a private matter. For instance, if Philip or others created a page Wiki/Future and started a discussion of what the Wiki could be, I think that would be a good thing. Should the Wiki be mostly for UCD students or should effort be made to broaden its community outreach? Should every Davis business be listed here? Is the intention to have it grow several fold or stay sort of asis? Or is the plan just to be totally handsoff and see what happens? In any case, I think some clear thinking is always a good thing. Users/SteveDavison
     Clear thinking is definitely a good thing.  I would suggest that you create the page you mentioned, put down your ideas, and see what happens.  I think it might be useful to talk about where we are and where we are headed, but I would caution that perhaps we dont want to have too many guidelines and intentions.  Still, if you have ideas, by all means put them down and lets have a discussion.  To sum it up:
>Image(editor.png)<

  Im open to anything.  In the code/server sense, I think having some sort of small yet established group that is responsible for maintence of the site (at a highlevel), is probably a good idea for longterm growth of the site.  Users/ArlenAbrahams been looking into nonprofit status.  By simply declaring nonprofit we have to create an entity, so this will probably have to happen.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060126 21:28:06 nbsp The HUB (the Davis High School newspaper) has recently had an article about Daviswiki. Though this may sound like a good way to promote the wiki, there is a good chance that there will be an uprise in the next month of useless edits and teenage userpages which will probably link to MySpace, Livejournal, Xanga and others of the like. Brace yourself. I heard something funny recently as well. Some high schools students refer to the wiki as the new MySpace. I dont see the resemblance, but some people really do think thats what it is. haha. Users/JohnDudek
  Shit. Users/GrahamFreeman

  If people treat the wiki soley to host myspace type pages on, we can always just edit their pages to be more relevant, right? Users/JosephBleckman
    Agreed... relevant userpages are one thing, blatant ooh lookitme Im so popular socalled profiles are ickyew. Users/CindySperry
          The non comment part of Mr. Keys profile seems quite exceptionally good, although his Daily Random Fact things way too myspace/blog like for my likings. Users/JosephBleckman
    The problem with editing MySpacetype pages is that MySpacetype users tend to spend inordinate amounts of time on the internet. Users/RoyWright

  I think user pages are user pages. So what if they want fluff on their page? I think it only makes that user look bad or useless or whatever. All we can really do it maybe add some links and hope they dont get deleted. I say the more people using the wiki the better. Ive heard from so many people who used the wiki to find an apartment or look up some late night food, even if they dont sign up and edit. And I think that means weve done our job. So who cares if someones on it and not doing anything? Theres not a whole lot of... censorship? authority? theres really no rules that says you need to do X amount of edits for every X amount of days/weeks/months youre on the wiki, theres no rules saying how many links you have to have on your personal page, so let people do what they want. Its their page that will suck and not yours. Users/michelleaccurso

20060131 17:04:04 nbsp We had 21 minutes of downtime due to another user on our system ungracefully restarting our webserver.  Everything should be fine now. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060218 03:50:39 nbsp I feel that people should not be included on the Wiki map. If you were to look for someone, wouldnt you just go to their personal page and find out where they lived? The extra dots also contribute to clutter on the map. While this isnt a problem now, it could get worse as more users join or forget to update their Map locations since most students move every year. People who leave the wiki (or Davis) might forget to delete their location as well, contributing to more clutter. Users/DussonYeung
  Good point. People dots would be cool if they were live, but at this point, they just add clutter. Ill go delete myself now.  Users/ArlenAbraham

  Theres a People category on the map, so filtering them out shouldnt be difficult.

20060618 09:58:09 nbsp I think the number of fake accounts used to trash/promote businesses, especially restaurants, is getting out of hand. The new user info feature is handy, should we just delete suspicious activity? If people only make one edit to one page, and then never edit again, it could be legitimate, but its likely fake. How do we tell the real people apart from the people who work for mountain mikes? Users/ArlenAbraham

20060720 13:04:50 nbsp should Todays Events be admin only? i cant see why someone would need to edit that. Users/ArlenAbraham

I am terribly concerned about the open ended debate pages.  These are increasing in number and are open ended.  Unlike Talk pages such as {{{Cults/Talk}}} which debate over specific points and then are deleted, these are debates over eternal issues.  As I wrote in an entry that indexed and proposed several new ongoing debates:

  Debating on a Wiki is only a little less stupid than using a wrench to pound a nail.  The Wiki is designed to coallate information and to that end hosts closed target debates that are deleted when over.  Opened ended debates cant be deleted and combed over for information to place in an entry.  When are you going to delete these to produce third person entries that have specific relevance to Davis and are useful to visitors?  This entry is quite possibly one of the most deadly to the Wiki, producing volumes of material illsuited to the Wiki itself.  Much better that this go to one of the sites http://davisforums.com/ intended for http://ucdavis.livejournal.com/ debate.  Users/JabberWokky

These started with the Abortion Debate monstrosity.  Are we seriously expecting to come to a conclusion on that issue and produce some sort of breakthough entry that satisfies all?  Does it seem likely that the ongoing debate on Abortion will be resolved on this Wiki?  They have long since passed debating wording and points of the Abortion entry... its now a free for all discussion that seems to have no end.  And unlike discussion threads on http://ucdavis.livejournal.com/ UCDavis LiveJournal, they will never have any end.  Six months, six years from now, they will still be growing (and splitting and mutating).  When do you call the discussion done and delete it?  Unlike forums designed for debate, these always grow and will devour the actual entries that the Wiki is here for.

I would delete these, but I think thats a big enough discussion to have the community weigh in.  To contrast with the debates Im worried about, this isnt an open debate: its a specific issue, and Id like to have a community decision... and then action, at which point this is deleted.
  I also think those pages are dumb, but a lot of people like standing on top of soap boxes. One thing that I dont know is how visible those pages are to JoeUser who doesnt obsessively watch Recent Changes. While I think the pages are dumb, Im not sure deleting them is the best idea. People use the wiki as a fourm because its easy to use, lots of people use it, and people like to argue. We could go around wantonly deleting pointless debate, but more pointless debate would just grow back. I think what we need to is attack this beast slowly. I dont have a plan of action here, but perhaps we can start by making a page on why people shouldnt have open ended debates, then deleting or sumarizing existing pages. For example on the abortion page, we can have a link to something like discussion and then the discussion page can talk about why discussing abortion on the wiki is pointless. I think a lot of people are going to object to this plan. The wiki has the potential to be an instrument for social change, and some people feel that abortion should be illegal in davis and will try their damnedest to make this happen. I want to see choice voting happen, and I would probably participate in a discussion on choice voting. Is a discussion about choice voting ok on the wiki? How do we decide what discussion is relevant and what is not? The Measure X page was huge and didnt really accomplish anything. Pages like Measure X and abortion become so large that they only serve the people actively involved in discussion. Ugh, now im rambling...  Users/ArlenAbraham

  I may be best to discuss removing specific things rather than to say that any debate or discussion on the wiki is pointless.  Lets try and avoid making Davis Wiki boring.  While I generally agree that debate about certain things, such as vegetarianism, arent really locally relevant, there are a number of global issues that folks may feel are relevant to Davis itself or would like to maybe discuss with Davis itself.  But its probably best to have these dealt with on a casebycase basis? Users/PhilipNeustrom


     Oh, I agree totally.  Debate on the Wiki is very important, and Im not looking to just stomp on everything calling itself a Debate.  Thats why I referred to a good debate (Cult/Talk)... there are several more, some of which have lasted for a long long time and are chaotic  Measure X is a good example of using the Wiki as a Forum for a Davis issue.  Im referring to open debates about nonWiki, nonDavis issues.  Yes, they need to be approached on a case by case basis.  Im bringing it up because the rapid appearance of several that are, in my mind, starting to cross out of the domain of the Wiki.  As I say, that line is one that the community should draw together, and (somewhat ironically), Im trying to start debate on the issue to feel out the opinions of others.  Fundamentally, Im worrying about the long view  what the shape of the Wiki will look like in, say, 2010.  Rather than thinking about an edit of a specific entry, Im thinking what series of edits can be done to prune and shape a growing, organic whole into a better end result.  Talk pages or long blocks of comments are fantastic because people know they will dwindle and disappear, enriching the entry.  Reviews (a specific form of comment) stand alone as a sampling of individual opinions without compromise.  Debates on Davis issues function as minutes of a town hall open forum, a record of the zeitgeist of the community on certain issues.  But even the real world town forums should not lapse into tangents too far astray.  Mosquito spraying or Measure X, yes.  Even Too damn Hot... makes perfect sense (my earlier comment regarding it was in the heat of passion on the issue).  The Wiki should have character.  But Ive always been leery of Abortion Debate as a topic too far astray from that town hall meeting qualification.  Having a General Debate on the topic of Food or an unprompted debate on Vegetarianism vs. Omnivorism worries me that the scope of debate has exited the boundaries of what is appropriate  what is prompted for by the needs of the Wiki.  DavisWiki is not Google Groups or Blogger.  Unless the community just likes debating on the Wiki and feel thats a path the site should take... in which case Ill be perfectly happy with it.  But I worry that debate has become the purpose, rather than debate having a purpose... which is a very subtle and very fundamental shift which I feel will have profound effects on the shape of the Wiki as a whole.

I think that even global issues can be made relevant to Davis.  Such as the juvenile justice page.  It started out to be just a general page about juvenile justice (prompted by the Halema Buzayan stuff), but then someone made the comment that it should have local things added to it.  This prompted me to search for and find all the local (Yolo County) information on how juvenile justice works.  I had to call and ask people for some information and other information came from minutes of meetings, websites of various government offices, etc.  Some of it still needs work, such as the Juvenile Justice Commission  there is nothing on any website.  I think that Im going to end up having to go over to the Probation Department to get information on what they actually do. Users/SharlaDaly

  Sharla  you posted this while I was writing the above.  Seed topics have always been something Ive seen as important and defended; Juvenile Justice is certainly a example of a excellent topic.  I even think colors can be turned into the basis for good Davis relevant entries.  Im talking about chatter between a few people that just goes back and forth about topics unrelated to Davis, the Wiki, and have no general intent other than as a place to chat. Hopefully my above comment clarifies what I was referring to. Users/JabberWokky jw

20060730 18:47:51 nbsp Are there any guidelines for citing/acknowledging sources? No one seems to do it and we dont have the same verifiability policy as Wikipedia, but it feels wrong to use info from, say, the Enterprise and not acknowledge it. Users/AndrewChen
   It probably should be done.  Theres a footnote macro just perfect for that... before the macro accepted links (the Dark Days), I used to use the following format: During the 19th annual Dixon Lambtown USA mutton bustin competition, the winner stayed on a bucking lamb for 5.35 seconds. ( http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/07/30/news/154new0.txt Source ).  You can see that format here and there... either that or the footnote macro should be decided on for the Wiki Style Guide. Users/JabberWokky jw

20061018 16:40:36 nbsp Currently I find the default commenting method rather difficult to parse when scanning a page. I was thinking perhaps altering how comments worked to split them into logical sections. Something as simple as a positive comment area and a negative comment area with separate buttons for both would make it a lot easier to read. Granted I have yet to look into the backend of a Wiki so the ease of such a change I am not currently sure of. Users/KevinRobinson

Should included notices (Photo Request, Stub, etc) go at the top or bottom of the entry?  Wikipedia uses the top, presumably so they stand out more.  Since some of ours (like Photo Request) sit on entries for quite awhile, and a placement at the top detracts from the entry.  Id say they should go at the bottom in general, as they stand out quite nicely on their own, and thus dont get in the way when a visitor (especially a nonwiki savvy one) reads the entry.  STOP and Copy/Paste would probably be exceptions, as they indicate far more serious notifications that affect the entry and should be known before the entry is read (that theres a dispute, or that the content may not be legal to use elsewhere).

    I think it should depend on how relevant the business is to the Davis community. If its a business that has plenty of others of its type in the Davis Area, it might not be that notable, but if it was very distinctive and played a key nitch in the Davis community (like a sole BBQ place in the area, or something like that) than it is worth remembering. If we start keeping tabs on all departed businesses in the region it would, I think, be equivient to expanding the scope of this wiki.

20070817 21:34:49 nbsp As of late, quite a few people have created pages on the wikispot hub that were intended for DavisWiki. What is probably happening is that they follow help links (which are interwiki links) and then they get to work on the hub w/o realizing that they have gone to another wiki. Its good to put the basic help docs on the hub for new wikis to use. However, I believe that this whole interwiki confusion would be resolved by keeping copies of all the help docs on dwiki. Users/WilliamLewis

    Is it just new accounts, though?  If so, it is probably the case that they create the account (on the hub) and then dont go back to Davis Wiki  they just create the page on the hub.

I think there is a problem here with people making comments about businesses (correct or not) where the businesses do not know how to respond.  One business owner complained to me for half an hour on the phone that the comments on the wiki had been destroying their business, as they were a franchise and the company that they franchised from was threatening to take away part of their franchise.  (Note: I never mentioned the wiki, and in fact I found them because they were listed on the wiki!)  I also dont think that the comments on the wiki were likely to be inaccurate, as they reflected my experience when I used that business many years ago.  But the point is that they didnt understand how to address the issues raised on the wiki  either by changing how their business operates to address those issues, or by explaining what was happening on the wiki.  Even after I explained to them how they could respond on the wiki itself, they didnt post anything.  They may not understand how to, or may not even be comfortable with using computers.  In any case, things do get a bit one sided  people post often when they have complaints, but not so often when they are satisfied.  And most businesses dont know how to respond, even though they could.  It seems important to change the situation so that businesses that need to improve can do so, and so that those that dont can address negative comments.  Perhaps a suggestions section for each business would allow people to recommend improvements to how they operate or in their customer service?  Perhaps something else?  Im really not sure what the best solution is here... Users/IDoNotExist

20080404 09:25:42 nbsp There has been a good deal of work put into business outreach, although it will perpetually be an ongoing effort.  The problem is that the badmouthing is associated with the wiki because it is visible here, as opposed to sidewalk conversations.  See Welcome to the Wiki for some effort that has gone into outreach, and the business owners section for specifically business oriented outreach.  Users/JasonAller Jason has also put together some print materials and presentations for business groups.  Empowering the businesses makes more sense than quieting the consumersFootnote(Except in one very specific case which has been batted around in email and really should be brought up on the wiki, which Ill do in the next day or two).  Why should a comment or review on the wiki be treated any differently than a persons comment or review elsewhere... on a blog, a newspaper or an email?  Better Business Bureau works in the same way as the wiki  collect complaints and allow businesses a chance to answer to them.  Yes, wiki reviews tend to be more critical (so do the BBB reports), but then the wiki isnt depending on the local businesses for advertising... check out the reviews in the Enterprise or Aggie of local restaurants (which are their paying clients) versus their reviews of movies.  There seems to be a feeling of you cant say bad things about me in print, no matter if it is true or not among quite a few businesses.

The wiki is also not a business/consumer binary system... it is merely an subject/individual system, and that is important to remember lest we fall into a group vs. group view.  The wiki reveals the opinions of the people in the community.  That opinion is almost never going to be purely positive, and there are going to be people dead set against the practices or aesthetics of the business.  Should the community not be given a voice?  If so, who should be allowed to review (or even write)?  Of course there are obnoxious edge examples involving people with a personal stake, and winnowing those out is part of how the wiki works.   Outreach to businesses is a key factor as well... feel free to help! Users/JabberWokky

20080404 10:03:47 nbsp I definitely dont think that anyone should be silenced!  The wiki is a very good thing, and most of the comments are probably fair.  Id really like to see businesses improve based on feedback in the wiki.  The goal is to improve things for everyone, right?  I do feel bad though reading things like the attacks on the owner of the Village Bakery.  Maybe they are valid.  Maybe they arent.  I really dont know, as I have no involvement with that business.  But how am I to tell?  Theres apparently one or more angry workers and an angry owner, and no evidence supporting either side.  Who do I believe?  (And not just in this particular case.)

In most cases though, I dont see the businesses responding.  Are they aware of the wiki?  Do they know how to respond?   Users/IDoNotExist

    There probably isnt a simple answer.  The edge cases have to be taken one by one, and if editors disagree, then it gets discussed.  It is hard to delete a comment, and it should be.  The only real place where there could be more activity is outreach, and even then some people dont use computers at all, while some simply wont want to participate in a group they cant control.  There will be some nasty cases of people butting heads... just like off the wiki.  If there werent, the wiki probably wouldnt be a good reflection of Davis.  There are some very nasty things on the wiki that do jibe with my personal experience.  If I hadnt seen actions by a business owner, I would have thought it was an outlandish accusation.  In other cases, a very serious claim was made, questioned, and then followed up with several people saying that the same thing happened to them.  Just like in real life, figuring out whose reviews to trust, and who to trust on serious claims is a social thing, not a technical issue (other than outing chicanery like sockpuppets  which can occur in real life And all my friends agree!). jw

 You can grab a date from Wiki history. The site went public on October 27, 2004. As for the number of pages on this wiki, look at the bottom of recent changes. Were currently at 12,582 pages. This number includes pages that some might not consider content, like redirects, talk pages, and user pages, so take that number with a grain of salt. Good luck with your presentation! WilliamLewis
    Perfect. Thanks!Users/BarryRice

20081216 15:16:55 nbsp Ok, I have a question for you all. I recently discovered what I think is unethical activity. One business listing contained very positive reviews by 2 separate people. Those SAME people made negative reviews on a competitors listing within days of the positive listing. Upon further investigation, those people have only made comments about these two listings (+ for one and  for the other). Also, the negative comments appear to be completely unfounded as a later independent comment confirms an opposite experience.

This to me screams unethical activity as it appears that somebody is manipulating the wiki for business gain (Im sure not for the first time). Ive made this clear by commenting on the original listing but another user removes my comments and claims that I should keep discussions limited to the business not to the users (but this is clearly about the business!).

What to do? Users/DrWang
   I agree with you  tagging information about a review that is not obvious is important.  Not everybody agrees.   I saw the back and forth edit and let it go.   If you want to raise it as an issue for group discussion, there is a Talk icon on every page.  Go to the page that has the edit you are disputing, and click the Talk icon.  Youll start a new entry with the suffix Talk to discuss the content of the main entry.  You are basically opening a something for discussion.  If its just one editor, you could also just talk to that editor directly by adding a comment on their profile (click their signature).  Sometimes its just a nuance that they took issue with... or they misread what you were saying.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090107 16:40:46 nbsp Thoughts on archiving versus deleting old comments?  I randomly go through sometimes and move older comments to a new page, typically Restaurant/200X Reviews.  Personally, I think a lot of older comments should be junked.  Many are side comments or questions, and I think that theyre the kind of thing that can be removed with time. Oftentimes they just are overlooked, which is why they hang around so long.   Whereas actual reviews of the place should stay on the archived page, as people can see a progression or what have you.  For example, http://daviswiki.org/The_Graduate/2005_and_2006_Reviews this page.  I think several of these can be deleted. But others might think its nifty to see later on.  So again, anyone have opinions on archiving versus deleting (some) old comments? Users/EdWins
    Years ago, a goal was to try to integrate everything. People would delete 10 to 15 older reviews and add a paragraph to the entry trying to sum up some viewpoints.    It seems over the years wiki usage changed, and the resulting buildup of comments is whats leading me to archive things (else a page is too darn long).  I still think a lot of things can be deleted though without really losing any value. (Again, theres a lot of small stuff thats just overlooked).   Users/Edwins ES

20090622 14:34:16 nbsp Is there any chance of redemption on the wiki when a business has garnered mixed reviews?  The naysayers will likely never change their opinions and the supporters watch miserably as business dwindles (in spite of their numbers and the fact that the original problem maybe no longer exists...)  Is there any way to deal with this, for exampke in the way that 3 years after a car accident, you get your record cleaned up and can start afresh?  Or do businesses just have to drag dead baggage around with them until the end of time? Users/WendySmyerYu
  Generally (after ~12 years) the old comments get archived. This puts them on a separate page, and the pages are generally organized by year. Thus, if I see a bad review on a page from 2007, but I also see that all of the reviews in the past six months are good, then I will assume that the business has improved in the interim. However, the wiki is a changing entity, as viewed in the discussion directly above this one, and it may become practice to delete very old reviews, as opposed to archiving them. One of the really big moves that can set a business apart, at least in my eyes, is for a representative of the business to respond to the negative comments. Even if the original commenter is being unreasonable, this shows that the business is working toward an understanding. Also, in those situations where the commenter is being unreasonable, it is usually pretty obvious to third parties how much of the problem is on the business end, and how much is from the customer. But the main point is that the wiki is not incredibly old, and is just now entering the point where we will have to figure out what to do with comments from 35 years in the past. Whether they are deleted, archived, or integrated into the main body of the entry, it is pretty clear if a business has changed their tune over time.
  Let us know which business you feel has unreasonably been criticized...  Ive provided feedback that at times was probably both unwarranted praise and at others unwarranted criticism.  Ill give any business a second try, although it takes a sincere attempt by the owner or employees to reach out to customers for me to come back for a second try.  I much prefer posting praise to criticism!  Users/ScottLay
  Im referring to the Davis Aikikai  not a typical productoriented business  classes are offered through the EC.  If you refer to the wiki page, there are two instances of negative feedback which weve been wondering how to deal with.  In the first case, the reviewer remained anonymous and in the second case the reviewer only sat in once on part of a class.  In the meantime we currently have a dozen very happy students (not counting the ones who have recently left only because circumstances took them out of Davis).  Of course were all aware of everyones right to have an opinion and express it, but at the same time, theres the sense that further responses will come across as merely defensiveness since the criticism is pointed at the instructors teaching style.  Accusations of abusiveness are pretty severe and serve, intentionally, only to turn people away.  We can argue pedagogy with critics until were blue, I guess, but if its any indication of a difference in perspective, my daughter (who is 12) takes the class (and is completely happy) and I have no second thoughts about her being in that environment at all.  As a dojo we are a great community  it extends out of the class, and is balanced with humor and serious attention and kindness on everyones parts, including the instructor.

20090716 21:27:29 nbsp I strongly feel that the Davis Wiki should support ssl, in lay terms, let users use https (i.e. https://daviswiki.org) in addition to plain old http. Many websites support both (even gmail, for instance). Ive set up sites to do this, it doesnt cost any more and only takes an hour or so to do. It does stop people from sniffing your account password either from a network or a wireless connection. Its transparent to most users; only if people type https do they get a secure connection. Users/SteveDavison

   Just so you know, the Wiki does use SSL, but only when logging in or at other such secure points in the session. jw

   We use SSL on login so your password isnt sent in plaintext over the wire.  The cookie is sent over standard HTTP after, though.  I believe theres no way around this other than keeping (or allowing) people to stay in {{{https}}} constantly.  Most every other website works this same way.  Gmail, for instance, logs you in via https but you can steal someones session by stealing all their nonhttps cookies (though I suspect gmail checks the end user IP and requires a peak at the SSL cookies thereafter).   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091125 08:53:13 nbsp The Daviswiki seems to have two modes, description and discussion. It is both a guide to Davis and a bulletin board for Davis, and I think the more separate these aspects are, the less effective the wiki is in reflecting Davis. Both encourage and contribute to each other, and contributors are the same in the wiki as a whole. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  I agree with this.  Incidentally, there are three modes: there is also metadiscussion about the wiki itself.  Distancing that from the other two makes sense to me, simply to keep the focus on Davis rather than the wiki.  Incidentally, thats not a strict rule: occasionally the meta discussion turns into a neat little insight into the community of Davis when it is more about the people than the wiki.   Incidentally, the idea of two modes is distressing.  Even very Target polarizing topics can have a writeup that expresses and respects the various viewpoints without degrading into a sterile bulleted list of pros and cons.  To foster a strong community voice in the wiki demands three things: people being willing to empathetically rewrite points they disagree with in a manner to insert their points (i.e., respect what you dont agree with), people being bold enough to state their points (which is a scary threshold), and a community that helps support people crossing that threshold rather than nitpicking edits.  There has been quite a bit of the latter this year, toward both new editors and experienced editors (its had a chilling effect on my own editing recently).  To empower all individuals of a community, there needs to be encouragement and guidance... and the willingness to accept actions that arent ideal to foster familiarity and comfort with the mechanisms of the wiki, technical and social, and also to encourage expanding the set of working traditions with new ideas that can only come from an editor fumbling around trying to figure out what works.   jw

An interesting article on the health of Wikipedia, which could translate to the health of this wiki as well:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8382477.stm

   Wikipedia and the Davis Wiki have radically different editor characteristics.  In the course of a year, one in seven Davis residents will contribute to the wiki.  Wikipedia has something like 50k (that range) editors over all time with millions+ of visitors a day.  They have some cultural and technical barriers to entry.  We have those too (anything does), but theyre far far lesser.  I think, for a lot of stuff, Wikipedia comparisons are kinda pointless.

   Also, an interesting tangent: Wikipedia essentially never gets positive press, despite being insanely useful and really rather fantastic.  The press jumps on nearly any story that paints them in a somewhat negative light.  Ive noticed this over the past four years or so.  Im not entirely sure why it is.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

The trend Ive noticed is that wiki growth has slowed heavily.  That probably means that weve just covered most aspects of life in Davis, the pages are becoming stable, and the wiki is becoming mature.  Theres nothing wrong with that, but as we approach some level of completeness, it seems important to keep people interested in contributing.   Users/IDoNotExist

   Perhaps the reason why Wikipedia gets negative press has to do with the fact that publishers of some newspapers also publish encyclopedias in book form. Reporters know where their paychecks come from and slant their stories accordingly.   Users/MaxLucas

I based my assertion about growth rates on the number of new pages that I see added per day.  Its not a scientific analysis, but if someone wants to graph and post the wikis growth rate, Im sure that would be helpful.  Note that at some point, this MUST happen, as there will be a wiki page on everything.  Before that happens, it is likely that a lot of people looking for a specific page will find one already there, and thus not add a new one.   Users/IDoNotExist
   The graph has been made, which is why Jason pointed out you shouldnt assume its slowing.  He made the graph.  Ive done a couple kick around stats over the years, and its not stabilizing.  As for the idea that the wiki will stop growing, that assumes that there will be no new bands, frats, city elections, professors, restaurants, land use controversies and that ASUCD becomes a peaceful and stable organization.  In short, the wiki stops growing at some point after Davis (and UC Davis) has ceased changing in any way.  I doubt that will occur soon.  It also assumes that there are no future changes and radical reinventions of how the wiki itself works.  Thats also unlikely as people come up with new ideas to rework existing content that grows, splits and is constantly reworked. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100105 13:36:22 nbsp Dear Oracle, my name is Chris. I own Mojo Flow Studio. The last time I changed my wiki page, I got into some hot water, so I thought Id run this by you first.

When my little business opened, we were in search of a business model. We have tried lots of ideas, and most of them havent worked. The Davis Wiki now contains some of the remnants of our past efforts. For example, the Wiki page Dance Baby Dance is about an activity that took place five times, about a year ago at our studio, and then disappeared. The Wiki page for Boogie Woogie Baby is similarly about an activity that happened about eight times, then was discontinued months ago. (In my defense, I didnt create either of these pages.)

Id also like to point out that the page Moms in motion concerns an activity (not related to my studio) that was discontinued a couple years ago. I know this because about a year ago I tracked down the person who was going to do this, and she lives in Santa Barbara now (as I recall). She told me that the Moms in Motion group was an idea she had that never actually did anything.

I understand that the philosophy of the Wiki is to serve as an archive for Davis information, but I suggest that some of this information can be so out of date that it becomes deceptive. For example, I spend probably a half hour at my computer tracking down the Moms in Motion person, only to find out that it never happened.

So I suggest the Davis Wiki might look at the issue of whether information can be out of date to the point that it doesnt belong here.

On a related subject, my business has decided to focus more on one activity: Pilates Flow Fitness. I was wondering what the Wiki group would think if I started a Wiki page devoted specifically to this one activity, and moved some of my Mojo Flow Studio Wiki page material over to this new page?

Thanks, Chris Pike (owner Mojo Flow Studio)

Im sure it was made in good faith but to me it just seems... a bit... stiff. Thoughts? Users/EBT
   There is no perfect way to do stuff like that.  If you go out on a limb and start encouraging and helping people, youre going to make mistakes and have miscommunication.  Its just a consequence of making the effort.  It looks fine to me, but then, Ive accused people of being really laughably obvious sockpuppets... and then had a few conversations with them later, where it was clear that they just happened to show up at the perfectly wrong time.  You will make mistakes, and you will come across wrong... unless you stay absolutely silent.  If everybody did that, we wouldnt have the wiki.  So dont worry about making mistakes, just do the best that you can and know that when you do get slammed because youre misinterpreted, or if you read a situation wrong, there are plenty of people who appreciated all the times you got it right and helped them out.   Youll also get better the more times you do it.  In short, it looks fine, and that kind of outreach is both a tricky thing to do and a really important aspect of how the wiki community helps and encourages each other.   Im sure Im not alone in appreciating your effort. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
    I agree with jw.  It doesnt seem sarcastic or condescending to me, but if the person in question takes it that way, its just yet another internet miscommunication.  They happen.  As for the edit on the Davis page... to me the problem isnt its stiffness, but rather the randomness of the polo link.  Then again, maybe thats OK.  cp
    Alrighty. Thanks for the feedback, both of you.




Running like a Business
    This thread was moved from Wiki Community/Future/Software Features


Almost all of the suggestions above are Editorrelated features, and almost none of them would benefit the common enduser. I think a focus on easeofuse for the average user, rather than niceties for the most common editors, would be a good thing to take into consideration before making suggestions, and before putting time into building any of the above. Very little has been done to make it easier for the average user, who may not be computer literate, to contribute. This may not be a business, but it needs to start getting run like a business in many respects. Users/GarrettGallegos
  Why does Wiki Spot need to be run like a business? And how would it be run like a business? wl
   I didnt say it needs to be run like a business, I said get run like a business in many respect  big difference there WL. FOR EXAMPLE: dont complain to users about formatting or too many edits (ie. treat them GOOD  LIKE CUSTOMERS  dont complain  dont treat them just like WoW users who are pissing you off  its quicker for you to fix mistakes than to complain to other users about their formatting). Also, focus on EASEOFUSE  ultimately what you want is IDENTICAL to many goals of a business  MOST # OF USERS  EASY AS POSSIBLE TO USE  Maximum payout from the website. This has a LOT in common with a business, once you get a reality check youll realize why. The end goal  $$$  is different, but that shouldnt affect your website goals. But apparently some developers just want to focus on development for the sake of development, not easyofuse and features for endusers. gg

20110323 18:53:22 nbsp Whups.  I just did a bad thing.  I just administrative deleted an edit I made to BruceHansens page.  I added a comment, intending to post an image of a table, but accidentally posted a URL to some porn (although it sounds lame, its actually from a Google image search for Barry Bonds mistress, who is going to testify about the size of his testicular shrinkage, which was a news bit on the radio about 10 minutes ago).  Wrong URL in the clipboard.  When I deleted it, I clicked the delete permanantly and hide from Recent Changes checkboxes in my haste... had I given it even a seconds thought, I would realize that, as most people cant do that, its an absolute abuse of admin abilities.  As soon as I hit delete, I groaned and came over here for full disclosure... which is pretty much more embarrassing than had I just deleted it normally.  Still, ethically, I gotta come clean, even the trivial stuff.  I apologize to the community; it was an act in haste and with no forethought.

For the record, permadeletes occur only about once a year (if that  it may have been two years since the last one) and tend to be for some idiot posting child porn.  Users/JabberWokky

  Clearly you will have to ban yourself. Existentially, I dont know if that is possible. Users/DonShor
      If the community supported it, I would actually do that.  Im stubborn like that.  jw

20110516 21:47:02 nbsp hey Users/yoyo
 Sup yo... yo.

20110926 13:07:11 nbsp I just admin reverted a phone number off of Users/CovertProfessors profile to remove it from the history.  WesP posted the private phone number of somebody not on the wiki.  I did so because it has been wiki tradition to do so, especially when it involves a third partys privacy who is not on the wiki (in the past, there have been stalkers posting Social Security Numbers, people posting addresses to other peoples private residences announcing a party, etc). Users/JabberWokky

20110927 19:47:41 nbsp Is there a way to post a photo from one entry to another without saving and reuploading? I was trying to post some pictures from the old manholes page on to the new, but it doesnt seem to be working for me. Users/ScottMeehleib
 There is a hackish way you can do it. Upload it to a page that only has the photo and include() that page on other pages. I dont think that it is worth it, though. People have been complaining about this for years. sigh Users/WilliamLewis

20120110 12:13:36 nbsp There was a reported stalking/threatening of one user of the wiki by another.  Although not directly related to the wiki, and the threats occurred in email, some of it happened here.  As I have only heard one side of the story and dont have access to the emails, I cannot be sure, but the postings seem to jibe with escalating emotion, and started to point out more and more personal information in an intimidating manner.   However after speaking on the phone to a coworker of the victim Im a little pissed right now, so in case its coloring my reading, Im holding off on anything else and would like some feedback.  If you can put together what Im saying, you should have the wiki skills needed to figure out who was involved and go back through the edit histories.  Please also have the tact not to contact the victim, should you figure out who it is. Users/JabberWokky
 I dont see enough information on the wiki to come to any conclusions. As you say, it looks like much of the potentially objectionable things happened off wiki. In the absence of any concrete information about these alleged threats, we should wait and see. If you see these threats and agree that they constitute unambiguous or thinly veiled threats of physical violence, I would support banning the user who made them indefinitely. Users/WilliamLewis

20120604 00:40:37 nbsp I was reading one of the reverted talk pages, and I thought that http://daviswiki.org/Bowerbird_Remodeling_and_Construction/Talk?actiondiff&version233&version132 angry man has a point: Maybe we really shouldnt be broadcasting the talk pages to search engines.  Any chance that we could add {{{Disallow: //Talk$}}} to {{{robots.txt}}}? Users/BrentLaabs

  Talks disallowed in robots .txt is a great idea, especially with the patch talk page shenanis, people are pointing to them expecting substance when its just talk, about a page, about something in Davis Daubert
  I very strongly agree. Users/DonShor
  This is a good idea. For reference right now, all diffs, info pages, and old versions of pages are hidden from google with <meta namerobots contentnoindex,nofollow>. Changing robots.txt is simple but inconsistent with what we do right now. Not that it matters. If Philip would accept the patch to sycamore, it might be nice to have an include that would allow us to turn this on for arbitrary pages along with the blanket hiding of talk pages with by method. Users/WilliamLewis
  I generally agree with talk pages not appearing on search engines. However, somewhat unrelated, when people or businesses threaten lawsuits, frivolous or otherwise, I think it is in the best interest of Wiki (and Davis) that that we document that and make the allegations clear to the world(search engines). That sort of thing has a very chilling effect on speech and I worry about it.  Users/MikeyCrews
    I agree with not having the Talk pages come up on the search engines, since they are not meant to be wiki content but only editorial discussion.  However, I am also tempted to agree with MC that threats should be noted  or at least, Id like to end this little episode with some sense that the business owner in question realizes that his behavior is not acceptable.   Users/CovertProfessor
      Should search engines index active editorial discussions?  It is an open process, and there is a link there for a reason, so perhaps that should be public.  jw, playing devils advocate for the sake of examining the assumption.
       It seems like they are public enough.  They can be seen on Recent Changes or by anyone who notices that the Talk icon is active.  Sometimes we even link to the Talk page from the main page if we are particularly trying to draw attention.  But the Patch suggestion  hey, everyone, join in!  could have been a disaster if anyone actually read Patch.  People would have largely missed the point that it was meant to be a discussion about the page and not about the issue.  I am not saying that only seasoned editors should use Talk pages, but one should at least understand what their purpose is.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120922 12:29:30 nbsp Id like to start moving pages about things located in woodland to the actual Woodland wiki (and putting crosswiki links in the appropriate places of course).  Might I run into resistance? Users/ScottRitchie

20121223 19:52:55 nbsp Hello, can someone help me out. I need to linked a restaurant menu? I already have the pictures but I cant figure out how to do it. Users/DGlez
  Sure, whats the restaurant?  If it is for Taqueria El Burrito, the menu is linked from it already  you can just edit the menu page, same as the page for the restaurant.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20130730 11:18:57 nbsp Dear, Wiki. Im concerned the popularity of this wonderful tool is fading.  Im the owner of a small business (pilates for bodies) and it has been well over a year since somebody left a review of my business.  By contrast, Ive had four or five yelp review in the same time. In fact, the Yelp salesperson called me up, and as part of his pitch he said, You know, the Davis Wiki is going out of fashion, and you should advertise on Yelp.  In notice, also that this discussion board hasnt had a comment in all of 2013.  So Im concerned.  Maybe it is time to regroup, and question assumptions and ideology, and ask how this can get bigger.  You might need a budged, and to pay people to pass flyers around town for example.  Sincerely, Chris Users/crpike

Its funny that the local yelp shill knows to try and sell around the wiki. The wiki loves you and doesnt need your money to advertise. Davis Wiki still crushes anyone when it comes to the lerkers looking for info. As far as discussion sitting still this is just general discussion individual discussions are usually handled page for page. ~SD
