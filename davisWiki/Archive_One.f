20041214 07:01:32 nbsp I fixed {{{RandomQuote}}} to work right.  Just so you know thats why its displaying nonweirdly.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041214 18:27:52 nbsp Is your location updater using the Wireless internet at the place or do you have to do it by hand?  Thats pretty sweet!  I can filter the updates to that page out of Recent Changes if you want (might be cool if you use it a lot?)  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041214 18:43:49 nbsp Its a bash script that checks the SSID and uses that to determine location.  It can also be called with a set of keywords for other locations (to override the SSID detect).  Im likely going to turn it into a nice library so it can be used to automatically update anything on the wiki (WAP interface for breaking news?  Who knows...)   Users/JabberWokky

20041215 11:27:03 nbsp Thanks for the heads up.  I made it not dump an error but it still doesnt work just right.  Mikell likely fix it because he knows the Recent Changes stuff better than I.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041216 15:04:50 nbsp hey, could you revert The THE Controversy to my version?  I think on pages with just discussion that a comment box ends up marginalizing the structure?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041216 15:10:43 nbsp The Location Updater is insanely great.  Can you do a writeup about what you did?  Users/MikeIvanov

20041216 15:29:57 nbsp Philip  I was editing the page when you saved yours, I believe.  I was trying to figure out what you had added (in terms of comments).  No problem  Ill revert the format and insert my comment.  Users/JabberWokky

20041216 15:31:35 nbsp MikeIvanov  No problem.  Its a bash script calling curl, which means you need OSX or Linux.  Once you have it, the only hard part is getting your MoinMoin key from your cookies.  Users/JabberWokky

20041217 22:17:23 nbsp Jabber, you should put a picture up! We know where you are at any minute of the day but we dont even know what you look like.  Users/JackHaskel

20041228 00:49:50 nbsp hey, thanks for hosting my song, the power chord ballad of the turtle. im sure your server has crashed a million times already due to the web traffic it has caused. Users/RaynatoCastro

20050112 09:23:02 nbsp The GSA is a nationwide organization, with chapters in high schools across the country. Users/BevSykes

20050115 23:53:25 nbsp It is possible that theres something wrong with the search, as I rebuilt the index this morning.  However, everything seemed to match up perfectly after the database was rebuilt (e.g. the number of pages indexed was the same as the number of pages in the wiki).  Let me know if there is a specific problem instance.  (I dont remember there being a Hings page until today) Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050121 13:33:43 nbsp thanks for reverting wiki ethics. Youre my hero! Users/CaptainRush

20050121 14:19:49 nbsp     Could very well be a lie too. Square brackets are a widely recognized way to delimit editorial comments made after the fact. Spelling corrections and simple rewordings can really help. Changing the meaning will likely engender resentment, mistrust and misunderstanding. When in doubt dont make the change.  If you are sure that a change will not change the meaning then I see fixing spelling and grammar as being courteous.  Changing the meaning is always bad.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050121 17:03:24 nbsp I was very very very wary of any changes to that particular page.  I also think that grammar and spelling mistakes carry information about the person you are speaking with.  If I see a very unlikely fact, I am much more inclined to believe the person who says I am certain that is true; I witnessed it myself versus d00d! u r 5m0k1n!! Eye 5aw 1T HAPPENZEZEZ!!!1!11oneoneone.  This is only in cases where you are dealing directly with a tree of comments, otherwise, correct away.  Keep in mind, I reverted to a mistake of mine.  At any rate, Im not rabid about this issue and Im perfectly content to leave the rereversion alone, but now you know my rationale. Users/JabberWokky

20050121 18:16:25 nbsp I see what youre saying.  Its not cutanddry, definitely.  But if the text is attributed and is an important part of the page then it only makes good readabilitysense to have it spelled/grammarered properly. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050121 18:25:22 nbsp Sorry if I edited a comment. Was it embeded in the text of a page? I purposely did not correct any misspelling I saw a name attatched to. Users/AmeliaCarlson

20050124 13:50:27 nbsp JabberWocky, I know that this isnt UCDavis only. My edit comment on Hotels was a reminder to the other contributers that this site doesnt just concern students. Users/KenBloom

20050210 12:00:47 nbsp are you sure about that crop dusting fact (that pesticides are harmless)? Im sure the MSDS incudes all sorts of precautions such as do not spray on humans. theres a reason farm workers wear long pants, long shirts, gloves, hats and bandanas. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050211 00:54:12 nbsp Arlen  For long term exposure, yes.  Dental xrays are harmless to the patient.  But the dentist or tech who takes 16 to 20 a day have to walk around behind a lead lined wall to avoid exposure.  Unless youre getting dusted on a daily basis, its not going to cause instant death.  Or even slow death. Users/JabberWokky

20050222 00:31:09 nbsp as awesome as that location thing is, im just kinda creeped out knowing that youve just turned on your computer in dixon. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050222 01:39:53 nbsp I really really need to document and upload that puppy for general use.  Theres a Wiki ID code that needs to be fished out of your browser, and thats the only tricky bit.  I need to write something to pull it automatically (youd have to enter your Wiki username and password once).  I wrote it so it would work on both Linux and OSX. Users/JabberWokky

20050226 19:41:10 nbsp I think its cool that you watch Father Ted!...Im not a fascist.  Im a priest.  Fascists dress up in black and tell people what to do.  Whereas priests...More drink! Users/MiriamKaufman

20050321 00:39:23 nbsp Thanks much for the changes on Cost Plus World Market. Youll probably see other arguments like this from me (bias makes me batty). Ill add a comment when I get to it. :) SS

20050321 01:55:15 nbsp Sorry, never read Lovecraft myself.  I took the spelling from the wikipedia.  Personally I find C. a little scary  kinda drives me crazy.  Except in plushie form  stuffed Cthulhus are so cute. Users/BrentLaabs

20050322 12:00:34 nbsp jw, what the fuck is going on? Users/ArlenAbraham
   No worries  somebody ran a goofy script to mess with the site.  I banned the user, called Users/MikeIvanov Mike, who banned the IP, and a bunch of really cool users like Users/AmeliaCarlson all got together and undid the damage.  The impressive part is not what he did, but how everybody came together and fixed it by hand faster than he did the damage with a script.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20050322 12:15:02 nbsp No problemo, just glad I happened to be on when Users/RobertMorris he started the edting; I dont think he realized it wasnt only making pages wider but screwing with images etc... (or else hell be back to finish the rest of the alphabet.) Users/AmeliaCarlson
   I caught him when he was in the Cs and blocked him.  Thanks for all the revert work.  Right now theres no tool to undo a users mass changes.  Users/PhilipNeustrom is now working on one.  In the meantime, you wield a mighty mouse... thanks for all the work reverting the damage.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20050322 15:22:09 nbsp who the hell was robert morris Users/JimSchwab
   Doesnt matter.  Hes done.    Users/JabberWokky jw

20050322 15:36:58 nbsp Do you actually play the violin? SS
   Yes.  And I just got a new one today.  Interesting timing to ask me that.  I am very rusty, having not played in about two years, but Sarah and I just got two new violins for her to learn on and myself to get caught back up on.  There are people who genuinely like my guitar (Ive played guitar in a few bands), and Ive been told that I have a pretty good singing voice (Ive... uhh... played guitar in a few bands), and Ive ben threatening to show up at Roma on Thursday one of the days.   Users/JabberWokky jw
  I could trade guitar lessons for violin lessons. Or you could just pay me. :) Actually, could you IM me? I cant find you on yahoo IM and do not know your AIM name. SS

20050323 18:09:09 nbsp Hey Evan, whats up with the nospace pages like TitleIndex and FindPage?  If theyre defined in the markup, we should just change the markup.  As it is, theyre mostly duplicates of actual pages, such as Title Index, etc.  They should be deleted.  Let me know what you think. Users/MikeIvanov
   Replied to your page.

20050323 18:31:07 nbsp That appears to be a lie. Users/MikeIvanov
   Darn past tense.

20050324 09:34:37 nbsp Were looking for an apartment in Davis.  Is The Arbors loud because of the freeway and train tracks? Thanks! Users/MonicaWilliams
   Im second row in from the tracks.  I cant really hear the freeway at all.  If I open my window, I can hear the trains, but with the window closed, you can only hear the train horns (which applies pretty much anywhere in town even fairly close to the tracks).  It is certainly not loud in my opinion.

20050327 13:22:00 nbsp you sound quite interesting :) Users/MarieHuynh
   Only when playing fluglehorn.  Otherwise, I am as boring as the number 8.2  Very boring number that... all not quite 8, but not sure I want to be 9, easily expressed in both a fraction and decimal.  Very mundane indeed.

20050329 18:39:07 nbsp That is an amazing rosemary shot! Actually, its the image of the bee that really blows me away. You must have a steady hand and a fast digital camera. Users/AlphaDog

20050403 11:06:02 nbsp JW, i went through and changed all the wikipedia and wikiwiki links to interwiki links. i didnt necessarily agree with all of them, i just changed them. i know that overlinking to other wikis is a bad idea, but valuable in some aspects. rather than controversy i think we should name the section what not to do. thoughts? Users/ArlenAbraham
   I actually like the interwiki links, and think they are a very good idea.  Im just trying to be the brakes on something that could get way out of control.  When I went through and removed a bunch of them, it was surgical, not a sweeping action.  I also created stubs for some of the links (in places where it would be better to have local pages rather than link to Wikipedia pages).  In others, I reproduced the content, but with a DavisWiki focus.   Users/JabberWokky

20050403 11:08:55 nbsp p.s. if you got one of http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS5204496011.html these implanted, your tracker could track you instead of your laptop. creepy. Users/ArlenAbraham
   I have an iPaq with Linux on it.  Ive thought about that.  Much more useful would be the first step to that  using my GPS and laptop and mapping the open WiFi APs in town with a chart for signal strength.  Its on my backburner TODO list.  Users/JabberWokky

20050405 00:05:30 nbsp its a franchise so im not going to lose my job over this. And if they do ask my boss to fire me, well then Ill sue like mad. And they got some deep pockets in vermont. Users/RobRoy

20050406 15:11:42 nbsp Wombat was a Wombat long before we became addicted to In A Fix,  I swear! Users/SummerSong

20050418 00:26:51 nbsp JW, just so you know. Every girl who I know, when asked about Sigma Chi, calls it the date rape frat. I dont know how it started but even people on GASC have said it. But you are TOTALLY right in that there should be proof but this is an awkward topic. Well see how this goes. At least it is getting more people using the wiki, even if it is just to defend their frat Users/RobRoy

20050418 11:50:56 nbsp I wasnt making accusations, rather poiting out that the frat is known as the date rape frat. i dont know if the name is deserved, but i for sure will stand behind the name being given. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Im perfectly happy with the commentary and think that if such things are being said, they should be mentioned in the entry.  Id be against removing it.  I just didnt want it to appear a casual slam page, but rather an entry about the frat that contains some serious charges.  jw

20050418 17:27:55 nbsp Thanks for the vote of support! It will be interesting to see if and what others decide to contribute. Hopefully it will be a good learning point. Users/AlphaDog

20050420 10:58:01 nbsp Can you link the article pointing out the fraud aspect of the Wendys finger story? I read something suggestive, but not definitive.  Users/CraigBrozinsky
   Yeah  suggestive only, as they have not made an official we are are focusing our investigation on the theory of... statement.  AFAIK, there is no official statement, but the actions of the investigators are focusing on searching her house and questioning her friends and neighbors, and thus it is a reasonable assumption.  I reworded it slightly to make it more clear which are facts versus which are conclusions.  jw

20050503 08:01:00 nbsp I have an appointment with Student Judicial Affairs on Wednesday.  I just assume that SJA contacted me because of the Aggie, because their Marketing Director threatened to have me arrested.  However, it could be about something totally unrelated  I really dont know, as I havent done anything immoral or harmful lately. Users/BrentLaabs

20050519 11:02:17 nbsp Morning! After I did all the asmundson links and research, I thought Id just put cross references in the ones that I was pretty sure about and figured Id do the fullon research in the next day or so. If you look at the city of davis link I included on the vigfus asmundson page, youll likely find the references needed to follow up on the stubs I created... just dont have time to do the search right now. Feel free to revert if they make you uncomfortable and Ill doubtlesss get back to them soon. Users/AlphaDog

20050523 14:17:52 nbsp Sorry for the late reply... just saw your comment on feeding the ducks today. Heres are a couple refs re ducks & susceptibility to fungal problems, though I dont think either were the ref I used when I posted the comment http://www.wires.org.au/docs/let_nature_feed_itself.pdf http://www.liveducks.com/bread.html. While its true that small amounts of bread in the diet are probably fine though nutritionally questionable, in park settings I think you get a lot of people tossing bread of questionable quality in the water and in volumes that end up growing in already skanky water. There will prob always be those who insist that they fed the ducks as a kid and none of em ever died, but the dangers should still be pointed out nonetheless. My 2 Users/AlphaDog

20050824 10:27:20 nbsp Hi JeffSpeckelsthenotanastronaut, Wokky, Evan, insert moniker of your choice.  You make a good point about inherent weakness of the wiki system with your criticism of Robs retelling of the infamous G St. Eye Incident. I believe most reasonably intelligent folks take the info in the wiki with a grain of salt, and with that attitude, they realize that stories such as this are open to research and correction. As it happens, in this particular case there probably isnt anything to research, since the incident didnt lead to any arrests on the night of the brawl, or, to my knowledge, at any point thereafter (something I would most likely have heard about, since I worked with Bouncer X during that time period). Just for clarifications sake, Rob does have the basic facts right, although the only verification the rest of the world has for it comes from people like myself who were there when it happened. Does a story like this really have to make a police blotter to gain veracity? Users/BigDave
   Im not JeffSpeckels  he seems to have edited his personal page so it looks like I might be him.  Robs a pretty good source, in my opinion.  I dont always agree with him, but hes not the type to omit important information.   Users/JabberWokky

20050824 10:28:25 nbsp On a totally unrelated subject, you and I look a whole lot alike, like a fair amount of the same stuff, and both play guitar. Perhaps this explains why people keep telling me I have a doppelganger somewhere in Davis. And why I keep getting called Evan. Users/BigDave
   Now thats possible  but I have just recently moved to Pennsylvania, so you get the town.  Unless I return, in which case well share on a road by road basis.  ;)  Users/JabberWokky

20050830 18:38:38 nbsp re: police misconduct page.. you know this for sure? I was going by the article: the couple somehow got the impression that an attempt was made to lure the girl to the car. That information was relayed to Davis police officers.  Especially if his parents were in the front seats and the ones who tried to talk to her, I dont see why hed be the one reported.

20051005 07:29:37 nbsp I look forward to the day when wiki authorship is represented by a wider age range.  But that will never happen while comments like those on the Senior Citizens page exist.

20051121 20:15:36 nbsp Howdy, Mr. That. The idea of a Wiki is that everybody works together to create pages. This page, the Explore page and every other page is a cooperative effort. If youd let people discuss some of the issues going on rather than deleting their comments and undoing their changes without any conversation, it would probably be a good idea. Edits are cooperative and in order to do that, they really have to be discussed. Nobody is fucking with your edits, they are merely doing the same thing you are doing  editing the pages of the Wiki. Everybody is equal here, which means they are editing, exactly as you are editing (although with different opinions at times). If you disagree with somebody elses edit, the best thing to do is discuss it with them... which is what people have been trying to do with you on this page.  jw  
  Exactly my point, I couldnt agree with you more. Perhaps I was a bit too harsh with Users/PhilipNeustrom Mr. Neustrom. My apologies. One thing you can be sure of is that it will never happen again. Users/SorryAboutThat Remorseful Editor

20051130 15:47:24 nbsp I noticed you changed my page.  I would appreciate it if you would leave my page the way i meant it to be.  I  was upset that you modified my page in such a way.  I wanted the page to be like that, with spelling like that, and without references to Davis Wildlife and enjoying the public.  So if you could leave my page alone, that would be great.  thanks JeromeJohnson

20051130 16:21:05 nbsp The anonymous edits were getting out of hand, I thought. Seperation was pretty good, but it looked like there was some discussion wanting to happen (negative comments to the positive comments, etc). A talk (eg experiences) page seemed like a logical step, considering the partisan nature of the topic... everyone wants to refute everyone elses experiences and what have you, so I figure when the activity dies down well end up with a few worthwhile comments to integrate. If you think leaving the whole mess on the main page is preferable, I will defer to you. Also, I doubt Jerome is really an old black man who attends high school as his IP sugguests.... if he is, oh boy. BALEET. Users/DomenicSantangelo

However, my plans to do that were interupted when my page was deleted.  anyway, im gonna put it back, and hopefully add my knowledge to some other pages. JeromeJohnson

20051203 15:03:27 nbsp I used the Users/ArlenAbraham arlen handle back when i didnt think there would be more than one arlen (my kerberos login is arlen), then i checked the directory and lo and behold, there were two more arlens! it was only a matter of time before one of the other came along and http://daviswiki.org/Nobu_Hiro?actionhighlight&valuearlenkwong edited something. Users/ArlenAbraham

20051207 22:09:12 nbsp You changed my sentence about the birth control pill as being abortifacient by saying the birth control pill is not abortifacient during normal usage. Well unless all usage is abnormal, than I believe you are incorrect. I do not know where you get your facts but this website is where I find my facts. http://www.epm.org/articles/bcp3300.html#_edn1 One of the effects of the pill is that it thickens the uterine lining and therefore any fertilized egg (a human person in my mind) has a problem with trying to implant. Therefore, in some cases, the human person dies when it cannot implant. Abortion. This is not simply when the pill is misused. The pill does not always prevent the sperm and the egg from meeting. In those cases, abortion can occur and that is while a person is using the birth control pill normally. Unless you have a good case against that, I am going to change it back. Users/ColinWen

20051209 19:54:32 nbsp Ok but it is deceptive to say normal usage because there is no usage of hormonal birth control where an abortion will absolutely not occur. All normal usage has the possibility of an abortion each time there is intercourse even if that is not the purpose. But I understand your point. They can but do not always cause abortions. By the way, the morning after pill can cause an abortion like this abortion website points out. http://www.nyabortion.com/birthcontrol/themorningpill.shtml They dont admit that the pill can cause an abortion but they tell you that it can prevent an egg from implanting in the uterine wall like the birth control pill does. For me, an abortion, at least in my book, is the ending of a pregnancy anytime after fertilization. Therefore the morning after pill can cause an abortion. Sorry, not to bring the argument to your page. But can we change the wording normal usage? I think simply having potentially abortifacient explains your point clearly. Users/ColinWen

20051217 22:44:06 nbsp How about making IntegrateComments into a more general Needs refactoring?  Certain pages (Sams, Abortion debate, etc) need help, and the graphic is nice!

20051218 01:20:02 nbsp The fact that the creator was a nazisupporter has local relevance in that there are people who live here who might not want to shop at the store because of it. If you want to include the local news of the black woman, please link the article without making the link editoriallized. For example, it can say Local news about IKEA in Sacramento otherwise I will change it. SS

20051218 01:32:52 nbsp The proposed text is OK. The nazi ties are a little more elaborate than that. Im not sure which, but one or two of the articles I linked now in the IKEA/Talk page talk about his public friendship to an open and active nazisupporter. If you included that, I would consider the proposed text alright. SS

20051218 01:42:43 nbsp I dont. The only people making any real problems on the decision are Domenic and Michelle; Ive respected their perspective and tried to validate it by revising to what I considered what they wanted. Its obvious that from their continued persistance in changing what I say that they dont want anything but to provoke me. I also dont think its necessary to wait on putting in the new text. I am going to do it myself.  SS

20060113 13:12:43 nbsp So why are you reverting my Psychic revert and deleting all their comments? They were funny, cute, nonoffensive, noninsulting, and kind of clever. Thats why I restored them. It wasnt a war or meanspirited or such. Explain. Users/SteveDavison
  Likewise, its hardly worth getting into an argument over and Im not one to get into a pushandshove revert war, plus I have great respect for you... True it didnt directly add to the Psychic page, but it was kind of lighthearted, and I enjoyed it. Sometimes things can be offtopic, yet valuable for other reasons. Just look at all of human conversation; people digress into all sorts of interesting but obviously offtopic subjects. Yet we permit and enjoy these anecdotes anyway. The comments section is appropriate for these. Frankly, I think its fine for the Wiki to have these little diversions. Newspapers are full of them. The Wiki doesnt have to read like an academic journal or even an encyclopedia. If it was a long meaningless banter I would feel differently, but about three lines of joking can add some appropriate and desirable levity in right place. Thats my overly long discussion on the matter.

June 15, 2006  I just worry that making this page is setting an uncomfortable precedent. Mrs. Daly does not appear to be a public figure of any sort at the moment, therefore I believe she deserves the right to not have biographical pages made about her unless she wishes for it to be. Im assuming that if she wanted the information Mrs. Bailes has been posting in a central part of a page about herself than she would have put it on her userpage.
That said, you do raise a good point about the benefit of helping to show people how the delineation between the two types of person pages works, so I acquiesce on this matter for now. Its just not the kind of thing Id like to see sitting around on here for too long, if Mrs. Daly doesnt want it to be. Users/JosephBleckman

I purchased and posted the Davis Enterprise article where I am mentioned on the Sharla Daly page, if youd like to see it.  You can decide it attending a meeting of the HRC qualifies me as a public figure.  SharlaDaly

I supported my original entry with a quote from the local newspaper.  I try to soften it by removing the alleged unethical behavior part.  Now shes trying to imply that everything was hunkydory.  Last night I verified with three different people that were on the commission at the time that there was a meeting scheduled to discuss removing her has the Chair, but she resigned before it happened.  If I have to get agendas, I can try.  But the newspaper article alone should substantiate the entry.    Users/SharlaDaly

20070202 05:47:05 nbsp I would disagree that the WikiPedia article is more informative because it mostly says I did it! from one city and Me too from another (sheep), while the Scotsman provides a thoughtful analysis. Also, if you are going to link to WikiPedia, try to use the wiki link. You have said that Daviswiki is not like WikiPedia because it does not require npov or objectivity, so I should tell you that I have often found WikiPedia talk pages more informative than their corresponding articles. I think this applies to Daviswiki also with regard to it being a form of communication and not just a Davis reference thing. You might not like to admit it, but Daviswiki is mostly a message board. Its wiki nature allows for it to be fairly well organized and for useful information to be easier to find, but most of the material is message board type stuff.

Which brings me to the issue of insulting language in Daviswiki articles. I feel somewhat more justified in insulting things that happen in Davis than other places because that is what Daviswiki is about and it is where I have lived all my life. If somebody can explain to me in detail why flashmobs are good then I am willing to be convinced, but if it is the sort of thing where if you dont already get it you are not going to, then I am not going to and will be annoyed. That is my point of view and I edit the wiki as such. When people communicate with me, including arguing, I learn from them and my point of view becomes broader, so I take most opportunities. Thank you for everything I have learned from you and I look forward to learning more in the future. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070212 06:32:16 nbsp Why does Mount Lassen need to be compared to Yellowstone? Iceland has geothermal stuff too, but we arent comparing it to Iceland. I knew about geothermal things at Mount Lassen and http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/gey_0.html The Geysers before I had ever heard of Yellowstone, and I am sure there are people in Europe who know that Iceland has geothermal activity but dont know about Yellowstone. The page presents Lassen as a more convenient alternative to Yellowstone, which in my opinion is not useful, because it is based on an assumption about other peoples ignorance. If yellowstone is what people want then they probably want to run over or get run over by buffalo and other things that Lassen doesnt have. They are different places and some similarities that they may have are a coincidence.

A google search for geothermal area lists Iceland first, then Nevada, California, Hawaii, New Zealand, and The Azores. Yellowstone is not even in the top ten, so it is not really famous for geothermal things in general. It is more famous for geysers (links two, three, and seven on google), but Lassen does not have wiki:WikiPedia:Geothermal_areas_in_Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park any true geysers. So somebody with a typical expectation for Yellowstone (geysers, buffalo) would probably not be interested in Lassen. Users/NickSchmalenberger

I understand the shuffling around of information for it makes the wiki more useful from the point of view of someone that does not identify as Native American or South Asian. Unfortunately, the grouping of ethnicity and cultures can give the impression that people who identify as those identities are being pushed aside, to be further ignored. The grouping of the orgs does make sense, but the pages with the descriptions and also academic programs (which should not fall under the title organizations) should remain. What do you think?

Theres barely anything on the Woodlands Restaurants page so its rather bare, but I do agree with Luke, Hawaiin food, especially traditional, wouldnt fall under what most people consider to be American food, despite its political/geographic state lines :P   And if it were to pop up, Id likely want Cajun to have its own category too, its definitely an established subset, style, and type of food.  I love Cajun cuisine.  Users/Edwins ES
  Heh, I didnt think it was this big a deal.  For both of you:  Im fine with a subcategory, and I didnt think it was a political statement.  I was merely trying to keep the total number of categories down and limit the number of categories with a single entry.  It was layout/readability that made me initially place it into American (with a comment).  Im perfectly happy with splitting out various cuisines, in fact I also considered a Diner category for Dons Diner, but instead stuck it into American for the exact same reason I tossed Ono Teriyaki into American: to keep those categories concise (since they each would/are the only entry in that category).  If I had added Ludys now, I likely would have tossed it in there as well.  I only corrected Edwins entry because I had already added Ono the day before, and it was listed twice when he added it again.  I gave my rationale for placing it where I did, and you both disagreed, which is fine by me.  It gets a distinct category.  Users/JabberWokky
     Thanks for the explanation; not a big deal, really, I just misunderstood your deletion of the category and the comment about Hawaii being a state. There has been some recent controversy in Hawaii and Washington DC about the status of Native Hawaiians, and I mistakenly thought it was related to that.  Users/DukeMcAdow
        Not at all, I wasnt even aware of any controversy.  The comment owes more to a comedy skit (Kids in the Hall?) involving somebody insisting that Canada was a state. And Jason is right (hint, hint, to the person who currently lives in Woodland), if Woodland had a full Wiki, there would be plenty of room for a massive restaurants entry and there would be no reason to try and keep it concise.  Users/JabberWokky
   If only there was a woodland wiki, then they could solve this... Wed be able to have interwiki links and everything. Users/JasonAller

I totally understood your intentions, but I also had some cultrual issues that I wanted to bring in to the mix in addition to the streamlineing of the wiki. To tell you the truth, I am not too educated on South Asians in the community, but I felt that it was not right to have the page removed. I am glad that we have reached a compromise now that there is more information on there. In the end, i thought the page needed to be there and need time to grow. hopefully this will be useful in the future; i guess if one person uses it as a resource it would be well worth it.

20070830 01:55:23 nbsp Given the fact that you know totally rad edit techniques and secret commands unknown to me before now and your general elder statesmen status I will ask you this here rather than on the talk page. Why would you say that archiving something like that is a bad idea? If I had seen something like that when I had come across these concerns I wouldnt have pressed the matter. Like you said there should never be anything hard and fast in this type of things but a step for a hint for a clue that someone could quickly get pointed to when they see things they disagree with would be seem to me at least to be a helpful thing. Wikiethics is maybe a start (I didnt find anything deep enough to satisfy the questions I wanted but still the idea was there) but the discussion pages are incredibly ungainly and hard to follow. If this question gets pulled up often why shouldnt someone who knows what they are talking about create something in the same vein as the real name deal?

Anyway, beyond that I just want to say I meant no disrespect to the people who have put in hard work here.

  Yup.  Ronald, Alexander, Gabe, Steven and guy who no one knows.  So saith complete and utter rumor.  This might be a new living arrangement, or could be completely wrong.  I dont really care much, but Id heard before this all happened (before Gabe posted to the SfL entry) something about them being roommates or were going to be.  Again, I have no certainty, so you could well be right.  Nor does it terribly much matter, unless you are implying that Gabe doesnt exist.  jw

20070907 23:24:57 nbsp Im also pretty positive Gabe exists :P   I suppose someone could simply have asked. But if they were roommates, then the whole I cant believe Steve took it this far thing would be pretty completely out of the blue. As it is, I used to read Steves blog, and theres Ron is mentioned multiple times, originally a roommate found in AIM. Big surprise that Ron was a big part of Steves ASUCD stuff, since he ran for senate.  I cant really imagine Steve and Gabe as roommates with all that kind of stuff (despite his love for secrets, the political use is just too high to stealth it), and again, pretty sure the rumor is false. I suppose its possible one could simply ask, though I dont know where this even came from (just saw a comment on Karls saying they are roommates).  Users/EdWins

   It makes sense to warn people, it is specifically the assertion that what is bad for a developing fetus is bad (or as bad) for a grown human that I dont like.  Plenty of medications are fine for adults, plenty of diseases are really minor to adults, and plenty of recreational drugs are fine for adults.  But there are medications that arent even supposed to be handled by women who might be pregnant, some minor diseases have profound effects on developing fetuses, and picture a very pregnant woman passed out on a couch after playing Edward 40 hands.  Not quite the same thing as a healthy nonpregnant adult in the same position, eh?  Its not the mercury is bad part that I dont like, but rather the idea that adults and developing fetuses have the same medical needs and concerns.  Its just a sloppy assumption.    Users/JabberWokky

    Yeah, I got that, but why the mits?  (sorry, jw, to carry on this conversation on your page, but youd remarked about it, and now I am curious). Users/CovertProfessor
       My guess is its a Jewish thing, maybe something in Yiddish?  That, or less likely, a New York thing.  Somewhere in the roots.Users/Edwins ES
        Yeah, it means with in Yiddish  thus my comment above: Egg mit what?  Egg with what?  In other words, theyre calling these things Egg with  wtf does that mean?  what is the egg with?  and where does the s on the end of mit come from?  But Im sure its supposed to be Yiddish; Noahs loves to (pretend to) do the Yiddish/NY thing.  Users/CovertProfessor
           Ive lived in South Florida for years, worked in Boca Raton for years, spent months in Manhattan (my employer at the times parent company was there), and I dated a woman for quite awhile whose mother taught Yiddish at a synagogue.  I have never heard of Egg Mits, nor seen one.  Wolfie Cohen never had it on his menus (that I know of). ... BUT... as I type this, the possible answer occurs to me: I think it might be Egg mit Bagel?  The odd suffix is because of a pluralization of the casual term that had dropped the bagel part of the name.  It does strike as odd, however, and Noahs is the only place that seems to use the phrase quite like that.  Users/JabberWokky
            Ah, yes, that makes sense, and explains how there can be a plain egg mit, which seemed like a contradiction in terms.  No more contradictory than the Egg Mit Turkey Sausage & Cheese though... Users/CovertProfessor

Like how local wikis sprang up from Davis, but then when people moved farther away, such as myself, they started wikis in those cities.

20071123 22:05:27 nbsp Jabber,

The information contained on a website that has information about me must be subject to my review. This is not a newspaper. The editors of the wiki are not trained journalists, but rather members of the public. I have not been interviwed by anyone editing my wiki page. What if someone from the Sac Bee published a story about me, without interviewing me, misquoting me, and misrepresenting me? In the real world, this reporter would be subject to a lawsuit!

The issue is that my personal page comes up under a google search, and it is available for anyone in the world to see. So, since this website is about me, dont you think that I should be able to edit a website that is exclusively devoted to me and activities I am involved in?

This is nuts. I obviously cant control what others do, but in my mind this is an abuse of wiki priveldges. Is it any wonder why the real wikipedia doesnt allow anyone to just edit a page however they see fit? Thus, they are a relatively credible source.

Anyway, if people insist on changing my page, then I will insist that the page be taken down. Users/EricFriedman

20071123 23:01:51 nbsp Jabber,

I would argue that Im not a public figure insofar that I do not hold a public office (please see my brief in ASUCD Court Case 424344.

But, thats not the issue. Ive already  told you that a page that is ABOUT ME should be subject to my review! Please let me know who designated the two page policy, one for the public to edit, and one personal page. There is no difference between the two. Both are pages about a specific user.

If James Schwabs or anyone else for that matter wants to create a page called My view on Eric Friedman, interviews me and doesnt contain any slanderous material, I would not object.

You belive that anyone who runs for an elected office is subject to public scrutiny? I do as well, and believe me, I have recieved a lot. But, this does mean that I am subject to censorship! If James Schwab wants to make comments about the page in the comments section, I think that is acceptable.

This is really insane. Who is the webmaster of the wiki? Please let me know who is in charge of this so I can discuss this matter with him or her. Users/EricFriedman

20071123 23:57:43 nbsp Thx. I get a little protective about local businesses, so its good to have feedback. If that person had a user page, signed his/her name, etc., I suppose it wouldnt be unreasonable to put an entry about another theater at the Varsity page. But it just looked like a driveby posting as it was. Users/DonShor

20071124 00:27:55 nbsp Mr. Edwards,

Thank you for taking the time to explain to me the way the wiki works.

Now, let me tell you the way I work. I am not community property. No one owns me but me. The page that is about me is my property. There is no other way to look to at it. Under your reasoning, becasue I hold an elected office in the UC Davis student government, it is OK for people to slander my name? This is ludicrous. I am getting fed up with this.

I completely disagree with the Wikis philosophy and I want nothing to do with the wiki community.

I will be deleting my page. Do not recreate it. Or is this against the wiki principles? I do not want to be a part of the wiki if I am subject to slander and harrassment. Does that make sense? Do you understand?

 Users/EricFriedman

20071124 15:52:38 nbsp Jabber,

Why do you keep on comparing the Wiki to a newspaper? The Wiki and Newspapers are not the same at all.

Newspapers have journalists that do investigative work, that research articles. While some entries on the Wiki live up to this standard (mostly business entries), many entries about individuals or ASUCD politics do not. Please show me how a website that allows anyone who signs up to edit entries is analagous to a newspaper? Newspapers HIRE their staff and editors. They allow people to submit commentary, but all commentary is subject to the editors review. Maybe, you could make a claim that the wiki is analagous to the National Enquirer. That would be the closest connection I would see.

No one at the wiki clears posts. What if someone posts something wrong? You would say that other editors would catch it, right? But, what if no one else knows if a piece of information is accurate?

Previously, someone posted an entry on my page that was just not true. How can I guard against random people posting slanderous material on my page? Im not going to be roaming the wiki 24 hours a day. And, who do I have to compain to? No one. The community? Well, the community is mostly composed of my rivals in student government!

Do you see my point? Do you see the inequity that occurs here?

Your camparison of the wiki to a newspaper is seriously flawed and the philosophy of the wiki is seriously flawed as well.

So, I will continue to keep my account and I will continue to delete my page whenever I log on. This is the only solution I can see under these circumstances. Users/EricFriedman
 The comparison to the newspaper is to highlight the fact that you cant just demand that someone change something they wrote against you. The analogy is a bad one because of all the journalistic standards are confusing you. wl

20071218 11:12:12 nbsp How should we deal with the advertisements the apartment complexes put on their pages? I added announcement form management, but wasnt sure what else. Users/JamesSchwab
  Id kick the question to the Wiki Community.  Personally, I work with the acid test of is it helpful to the community, which makes sense for menus and specials on restaurants, and would probably apply to any open house or similar announcement.  The entry for Tandemonium is quite salesy right now, but thats to be expected with only one editor so far having poked at it.  Im going to give them serious credit for having included the link back to the Housing Guide and Apartments entry.  The difference between information about deals and spam is pretty much if theres input from everybody and its presented as an option alongside others versus hyperbole oneway we are your only solution information with no allowance for everybody (customers, mostly) to add their input.  So far, the person editing under AdobeManagement seems to be probusiness but not anticustomer (leaving reviews in place, keeping links to competitors).  A probusiness and procustomer (and proanybody else) policy seems to be the best way to serve all the parts of the Davis community.  (IMO, etc etc... this really should go to Wiki Community) jw

20071231 13:28:51 nbsp Are you sure there arent animated PNGs? How then does HimySyed upload all his animated tinylogos? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  They are gif files that were uploaded before the new feature that tests the filetype and corrects the extension.  Download one and run file: {{{tinylogo.png: GIF image data, version 89a, 16 x 16}}}.  There are a few proposed animated PNG formats (like APNG), but the MNG format is the official and most adopted solution, but it only has very light browser support (where PNG was a few years ago).  It wouldnt help in this case anyway, as it has a different mimetype and file extension so it would presumably be renamed as well (and wouldnt work in most browsers anyway).  Basically, unless there are other Konqueror users, Id be the only one to be able to see it (although KDE4 will run on OSX and Windows, Im not expecting a huge expansion in users overnight).  Mozilla removed support for MNG due to lack of real world use.  APNG was checked into Mozilla 3, but has since been officially rejected by the PNG working group, and it looks like it too will be removed.  libpng and libmng obviously support them, but browsers... not so much.  Basically, for animation, .gif is the only real world web solution (outside of things like flash and dhtml, obviously).  It has a tainted history, but is completely free now.  Unix itself came out of the biggest, nastiest monopoly around, but BSD and Linux arent tainted by their heritage... .gif probably deserves more respect than it gets for the niche it fills (at least now that it is patent free).  In a bizarre little twist, I had a dream about .gif last night.  Yeah, my REM rolls like that.  Users/JabberWokky
  Just double checked: wiki:wikipedia:Comparison of Web Browsers.  Konqueror is the only listed that supports any of the animated PNG formats. jw

20080108 10:08:56 nbsp LOL! I was sitting there thinking, why would he care what I wrote about Davis Nursery?  Ok: I think snarky comments about how bad their expresso is, how bad their cappuccino is, and how all Davis coffee shops serve bad expresso, are clearly a comment not an objective or even reasonable description of Mishkas. IMO it belongs in comments. I do have an aversion to unfounded negative comments about local businesses, as they have a tendency to affect the local business. In the comments section, the next person can simply refute it. I suppose I could have gone in and edited the text to say no, their expresso is great, and so is the expresso at other coffee shops in Davis, but I think you can see how that would be less effective.

20080224 03:19:31 nbsp A while ago I asked in the FAQ if it was possible to include video in an article.  I had specifically asked of it would be possible to use my own HTML code because thats what I do on my web site.  Obviously it would be a security big issue.  I thought about it more, and I think the method I describe below would work and could be interesting.

http://www.vidiac.com/websiteowner.aspx Vidiac offers a package that lets you upload video in pretty much the YouTube manner (Vidiac predates YouTube) but with better video quality.  If a Vidiacbased site was set up for a community (rather than national) then locals could upload video, and using http://www.streetfire.net/ StreetFire.nets method, they could insert a video/videotype command to embed the video.  (For details: http://forums.streetfire.net/showthread.php?t6941) Wiki would have to write the video/video routines, but Im sure StreetFire would help.  (Ive mentioned this to them.)  Anyway, for the authors of articles its easy, and thered be no security issues.

A localoriented videohosting service itself would be a good thing.  It would offer a place to upload content that is only of local interest, perhaps not even something that we would ever post on youtube.  If kids uploading things they want to show their friends is a concern, then more than likely theyd rather put it on youtube.  A local http://www.vidiac.com/websiteowner.aspx Vidiac site would be a place to host videos of things like city council meetings, high school sports, Davis Community cable productions, school plays, UCD videos, and of course videos that wiki authors would want to put in their articles.

Not sure how you came to the poop conclusion, especially if you had looked at the comment made for the edit(s). The problem with (rather, for) the Unitarian church is that the Ge0cities page wrongly list the Unitarian church as the site of a MA meeting. If the church name is spelled correctly on Wikidavis, the already too high relevance of that site to the church  and MA is greater on search engine results pages (SERPs), when Im trying to decrease the visibility the Ge0cities page. The church would also like the site to go away. Users/unstoner

First, Im throwing around poop (and no apology offered when objection made), then Im now spreading some unspecified lie with unspecified spam. Cant be sure of what is being insinuated. Good correct info cant be a lie or spam. Enough of the whine. I made edits made convoluted meet by odd restrictions and even odder and offthemark rationals. Silly as it seems, changing Wikidaviss policy is not worth the effort and, I hope, will be unneeded. Users/unstoner

Nothing misleading or dishonest was attempted and no fake information was added. By having the correct data and links on Wikidavis, the harm can be mitigated and possibly reversed while serving the community well. Moreover, the benefit to the site user is the first concern in all of this. The search engine issues are secondary, though legitimate, concerns. Nonetheless, Ive complied and made edits to meet curious sensibilities apparently more concerned with form than substance. I still have no idea what Lets not poop on neighbors means and the humor is hard to fathom.  If I took offense is not at issue, I did take offense, and was clear about it. Ill note that the still vague and broad accusation of posting lies and spam on Wikidavis has not been retracted. This makes the attempted humble apology hard to accept and appearing to be neither.

Apology and retraction accepted and since the content as it is serves good purposes  already reflected in SERPs , Ill consider everything else is resolved and the civil disagreements about SEO are now unimportant. Users/unstoner

20080307 09:10:37 nbsp Yeah, I should have... I was just muddling my way through it. :) Ill go back and fix them.  Users/ElleWeber

The yes or no question presumes a lot  such as I am manipulating SERPs, in a way that can do damage and the needs of the site user is diregarded and thwarted. On obscure search terms search engines will draw and associate keywords from URLs becuase they are not finding them in more visible locations. Consequently, to have Geo spelled out means Wikidavis is voting for a web site that is wrong and unfortuantely unremoveable. Youre suggesting that Wilkidavis should via associated keywords help it to show high in SERPs by naming it. To avoid doing that, while in no way misleading anyone  quite the oppipsite, in fact  and working to avoid spreading out of date inforation to people who truly need to have correct information, is a desired goal. The objection to this is hard to understand, and the interagoraty demand is unfair and should be withdrawn. With is the wrong and what is the harm? Users/unstoner

Youre not addressing any of the above and are likewise subject to the question. Are you trying to manipulate SERPs as well? (You started it. wont do as a defense). And, do you take responsiblity for the bad results you will cause and could easily prevent?  Users/unstoner

Wok, I know this response goes at least in part to someone else, but here it is. Its time to everyone to slow down. I have complied with the preference for not having it missspelled Ge0cities and have no intention to get into a revert war.  So a lot of the aruguments seems moot. Now why do we have to be explicit and actually name the wrong page enough for search engines to associate it with keywords, and thereby validate it, when the page as it is does the job very well? The community is informed, helped and not mislead in any way.  Your peference would have the unfortunate and opposite effect. As for getting the page down, I would do that in a heartbeat. I have already made attempts to do so. So how is this done?

P.S. Welcome to the web. Its sounds like you were hoping for something else. You cant abdicate the affect of Wikidavis, the idea is to make sure your side of the street is clean. Theres a good probability that search engine issues can become standard fare and that will oblige you to deal with them, albeit reluctantly. Users/unstoner

Anytime Jab, those little Wiki link icons sure look cute and add so much. ;} Users/unstoner

20080316 14:51:20 nbsp I guess I will once I figure out how to edit these pages properly (for example, how to reply to your comment without me using the comments thing to create a new comment). Ive mostly been commenting on stuff cause thats the easiest thing to do rather than editing pages. I am computer savvy, but not yet wikisavvy. However, your comment has motivated me to compile my Rolodex into a wikisuitable list. Any recommendations on how to post it would be appreciated. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

Well, Ol Jab, if your done telling me how to feel and presuming what I feel, heres my reply. Ill guess that your reacting to my saying it might be best and more courteous to ask what is the relevance first, rather than risk presuming from ignorance that there is none. Since that was the only comment directed to you, your reply seems completely out of proportion, especially when it goes as low as to include ridicule. More on that later. Your saying  I proposed a revision with an edit... is a contradiction and an attempt to have it both ways. You either propose an edit, or you at least signify it is a proposed edit. You did neither.  In your case, it seemed more than proposed when it was to remove not really relevant info.  Youve also falsely accused me of being combative about every edit! Besides being not so when several significant edits have not provoked alleged, unvaried combative  reactions (look up a few comments to see proof otherwise), this also ignores how quarrelsome and belligerent you have been  you may remember your heated yes or no interrogation, which centered around how to precisely refer to how the defunct Davis meeting which was so particularly contentious. Why should it be surprising that your most recent edit bring to mind another escalation on your part regarding almost the same issue as before?  What could be in doubt about my goals?  If you have solid basis to challenge them, please do, otherwise, youre on another fishing expedition.  Your only valid concern is whether the entries and edits of them are good or bad.  Im glad to hear Theres no disagreement here,  and that my explanatory comments seem to have had some good affect. Unfortunately, they have also prompted personal, patronizing and smug remarks like The sun still shines, somebody loves you.... I  imagine a subsequent retort of yours saying your still taking it way too seriously, Dude.  If your response was actually measured and patient as it pretends to be, I wouldnt have grounds to suggest the same of you. — Users/unstoner

Nah. You could apply your advice and just Apply compress, take two aspirin, place head between legs.  Any wonder why Im not eager to phone you?

Im all for a fresh start. Barring vociferous objections, Ill delete your comments from my user page tomorrow. If you were to delete mine, I think that would allow a lot of inside baseball to go away.

20080325 09:18:33 nbsp Id suggest the addition of a (free) WiFi field for the restaurant and business templates.  Its useful to know where you can get a connection when you are deciding where to go.  This would probably have to be retrofitted onto existing business and restaurant pages. Users/IDoNotExist

20080325 11:02:52 nbsp Ive added a few additional fields to the restaurants tab.  If people like them, is there a way to propagate them to the other restaurant wiki entries without doing so manually? Users/IDoNotExist

20080325 11:05:02 nbsp Not sure how the wiki backend is managed currently, but perhaps template fields could be autofilled from data in a database.  This would allow new fields to be added as needed, with changes reflected throughout the wiki where appropriate, without having to update every wiki page manually.  (Or does this already exist?) Users/IDoNotExist

20080325 11:12:45 nbsp An idea for an additional template: Map.  This would show the subject of the page on a google map plot (perhaps embedded in another wiki page?)

The advantage to using this spreadsheet is that all of the data is in one place, and people can easily eliminate any apartments that dont interest them.

 Well, I think its a matter of opinion either way you see it.  Some people believe using your real name online has such great importance that doing so puts them at risk of identity theft or what not (many people go so far as to do this in real life when leaving contact information, or lack thereof, at a business when its necessary for the customer to be contacted for whatever reason).  Then again, some people think that using your real name when saying something online has no significance either way and its a nonissue (sort of like how people make a single comment on Daviswiki and never log on again...or how someone tries to get an employee of a retail store fired by complaining to the persons superior just because they werent treated like a VIP or something).  So perhaps its both under and overestimated. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080518 19:15:34 nbsp Perhaps it should read then, The importance of using your RealName can not, and should not, be estimated, since such an estimate probably isnt particularly meaningful to anyone (unless you think it is, in which case, perhaps it should!)  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20080701 14:02:43 nbsp Oh, shoot.  I didnt even know there were DWiki pages for Bahai and Scientology!  I guess I made that assumption because Ive been editing of pages directed from the Lame Wiki Pages listing (in attempt to remedy some of these pages of their ills), and the Christianity one is at the very top under unsalvageable. So I guess I just assumed that those types of pages are frowned upon. This is what happens when I just jump into editing stuff that I dont really know anything about...  Plus, I havent been editing here for very long, since the wiki didnt become popular until right after I left for Santa Cruz.  Im still new to the site navigation and learning exactly what pages exist and what is still missing.

20080806 10:23:40 nbsp The fast that Im posting this comment here instead of on the Davis Wiki talk page is an example of why the following is true.  The wiki has grown sufficiently large that information on it is becoming difficult to find, even using the search function.  (For example, I just searched for 5 minutes for the wiki talk page, and couldnt find it!)  The search feature needs to be able to handle much more sophisticated searching  boolean searching, and metadata searching.  ie.

20080814 16:29:32 nbsp Hey, thanks for the  suggestion on my page. Im still relatively new and I thought if I made a mistake somewhere someone would catch me. I also fixed the photo on the SFBO page and made sure the image was released under creative commons. Even if I didnt change it, would there be any way for you to tell if I was cheating or not? Also, I think my argument about the people page not being alphabetical holds in a theoretical sense. If someone made a profile with only a first name, where would they put it? Same goes for someone who made a random name like butterfly. Yet, since most people have a first/last name combo, I guess the ordering system works in all practically, but its still a bit yucky.

20080820 10:36:33 nbsp Heh, no I actually think its for the better.  The amount people were buying in order to make the list was pretty obscene, like $20 worth per cup, which is just over 3 pounds each.  According to one of the sales people, one of the guys who made the list promptly puked up the whole thing in the garbage can directly outside the store.  I bet the contest became something of a liability for them, especially if people didnt quite make it outside before their bodies decided to reject that unfathomable amount of sugar and dairy product.

20080823 15:46:16 nbsp Re: City of Davis. The first sentence of the page indicates that the page is about the municipal government, not the community. In my opinion, Davis is not the same as the City of Davis. The latter is the formal government entity, and the former is what most people think of when they say Davis. Given that, theres nothing inaccurate about saying it is run by the City Manager and city staff, and governed by the City Council. I think adding bureaucratic infrastructure and city services is superfluous because that was already established in the first sentence. Users/JeremyOgul

20081014 11:00:09 nbsp Please stop putting your comment up on Roxies page. You are making false assumptions, and false accusations. If, indeed, you are monitoring IP addresses and invalidate a comment simply because it comes from the same IP address as a comment sent a few moments earlier, how then do you account for more than one person using the same computer? Or in the case of Roxie, the same hairstylist? And to base your accusation on the choice of wording seems extremely superficial. After all, how many different ways can you say I got a great haircut? TonyB and EGrace are a husband and wife; they use the same computer, and the same hairstylist. I dont know who the other two are, but you certainly are invalidating their comments. While you may be providing a service to some, you are not providing a service to Roxie. Please stop.

20081014 15:25:02 nbsp Evan, Thanks for taking the time to explain how some of this works. While in concept a wiki is a beautiful thing, in reality it can get a little muddled. While it purports to be an open environment, it really isnt because it is, in a sense, being policed. Even though it is being policed for the common good it can be misleading because, based on assumptions, along the way someone is judging someone else.
At any rate, thanks for clearing this up. I will tread more carefully in the future.

20081022 11:49:47 nbsp Thanks Jabberwokky, very interesting. Ill take time to peruse this page a little more later but I want to thank for your feedback on my page.  One of my strongest interests is can the web do local community? And do it well as pcs and other factors have destroyed a sense of locality in many areas although it seems to be returning now more and more...perhaps we just needed to have a sense of what it looks like to see nothing but corporate facades every which way you look and say, hey, dont want that!

Of course, its more complicated than that but over here in Sonoma/Marin/Napa counties I distribute cards and word of mouth for two aspiring local connectors.  First is http://www.waccobb.net and the second is called Aqus news, and is sign up only, not directly interactive, and linked with the Moose Lodge over here in Petaluma.  Its run by a guy named John Crowley who grew up in Scotland and was amazed at how dislocated Americans were from each other when he moved over here.  He does a nice job addressing this reality but both Wacco and Aqus still are limited in terms of usefulness by the amount of traffic they generate.

20081120 12:14:15 nbsp Its not all that different really. At the base of it, if a business owner wants to support something, they have every right to. In the same vein, so do their customers. Thats relatively simple. If that puts them at odds, it has nothing to do with them not being able to express their feelings, its simply a consequence of their differences.  I had a longer post, but I deleted most of it and went on a different track;  Some people may prefer to buy organic items. Or to buy fair trade items. Or to buy local to support local businesses (or because theyre against chain stores). Similarly, if given the choice, some may prefer to reward businesses with whose management they agree with on other sociopolitical issues.   Its really not all that much different of a reason to support or avoid a place, its very relative to what that particular consumer subset values.   Users/EdWins

  I agree. I enjoyed the comment and thought it made a good point (although I dont necessarily agree. Im all for good points I dont agree with. My comment right after it was not in response to yours, so your comment that I missed your point was slightly off the mark. I did make a direct reply but then removed it when your comment was removed). BTW: Its funny. I moved here this year from Pa., because my wife came to Davis for her first postdoc. Looks like our paths crisscrossed. Enjoy Pa. While I agree there are some similarities (I went to school at Lock Haven, which is about 30 minutes from State College), the differences seem to me more luminous now that Im here in Calif., and thus more memorable.

20081210 06:31:06 nbsp Evan,
Regarding my footnotetothefootnote on the Ryerson page and your comment about sarcasm, I could suggest that editors actually do a bit of digging before citing something. I added the expanded dates earlyish in the day and found Elle Webers odd footnote, not exactly disputing the facts, but casting doubt on them, later the same day. It took me no more than two minutes to locate four reliable sources for Ryersonss DOB, which I then weighed, as one must, even with official documents, against the other sources, which I then judged to be unreliable. What you called sarcasm was a minor goad to anyone reading it, including me, to actually look, weigh, and judge before stating (or disputing) a fact. And by the way, I never contradicted the fact that other sources give a different DOB, which is certainly an accurate statement, and thats why I didnt strike the original footnote.
And I really do like that footnote macro, though, now that Ive seen it in action!

20081221 16:28:58 nbsp Daubert moved your response to the comments. Not me. I actually did delete it from the entry earlier, he added it back.  It seemed silly to me that he thinks your response wasnt worthy of being in the entry, but his edits were.  So I decided to move his down as well, especially as it may just be random information that might not be correct (even if he considers it to be so), which is why I asked for some sort of verification from him. In simpler terms, decided to move the rest of the potential opinion down there until it proved itself (and again, couldnt delete as he added it back).  Users/EdWins
His response is worthy of being in the entry, I just wanted him to flesh out his statement more. Should I have just used the top of the entry as a discussion ground?  Users/StevenDaubert after reading the other half, it should be noted that I culled the random information from various reputable sources online (wikipedia and what they source) before making the addition in the 1st place.

20081228 14:38:16 nbsp Mr. Edwards, thank you for your comments and opinions.

This is for your reference, by the way:

TO: Mr. Nick Schmalenberger
CC: JabberWocky

Mr. Schmalenberger, I would appreciate it if you didnt get belligerent in your messages to me. It is offensive and unproductive toward our main cause, which is improving the wiki. I love Davis, as do you, so it would be in our best interests to treat each other with respect. Note that it is in conflict with Wiki Ethics  to use confrontational speech.

You mention that I removed the portion of the article just because you dont like it. This is a false assertion, per my explanation for you as to why I edited that entry (see comment above). If that is your interpretation of my reasoning, I apologize that you misunderstand me so vastly.

You state that the idea of pages having a purpose of informing the wiki public is BS. It is my opinion that you have missed the overarching objective of the wiki. I am also afraid that you have neglected to read the Wiki Introduction, which states that the wiki is a place for sharing, listening, learning, growing and exploring, and that it is a place to record Davis culture, places, and spots. I fully agree with your AND the wiki Intros sentiment that what the wiki contains and means is up to you. As a general rule you should contribute content you think will be helpful or insightful to others, but even this rule can be broken at times.

In removing Marie Huynhs anecdote, my objective was only toward improving the entry as a whole, and not toward removing a humanizing aspect of the entry. I still maintain that Huynhs anecdote is less of a humanizing aspect of the entry and more of an irrelevancy for the fact that it is NOT informative, as would be Jabberwockys example of there are particularly nice smelling flowers on the slope outside the store. (see Jabberwocky comment for reference.) Do what you will with the Frys page, however, because you clearly have a very deep attachment to Huynhs comment whereby you felt it necessary to contact me.

As for your citation of my Orgasmatron page, I am flattered that you expended such effort to find a page I created so as to back up your argument, because this gives me the opportunity to share with a fellow Davislover a great piece of town trivia: It just so happens that the Orgasmatrons sign has been up since the 1970s and was the location of all California Aggie photographic production predigital technology (note that this is a place or spot in Davis, as the Wiki Intro states). There are, of course, secrets about the room that I am not at liberty to divulge because they remain classified except for those in the know at The California Aggie. In essence, this page exists because as you say, I can relate to the text from my own experiences. Users/EliseKane

20081228 20:35:38 nbsp Oh, dont worry. I wasnt upset at all. It was barely a blip on the radar for me; I dont know about Schmalenberger, however. The fact that he made an issue of it in the first place and wrote so aggressively to me is a telltale sign that his feathers were rumpled. Poor guy.  Users/EliseKane

20090313 11:10:23 nbsp Hi, sorry if there was a misunderstanding.  I realized that I wanted to clear some facts up before i posted my comment, so i deleted it.  I also deleted a double posted comment.  I figured that was a mistake, but if it wasnt, sorry! Users/E.Liu

20090324 14:43:21 nbsp Thanks, JW!  I hadnt seen the Huel Houser thing.  God, this is going to be hilarious.  Im sure he just gets so excited about this.  Were talking about a guy that acts so excited over different sizes of gravel.

Thanks for the link to the Adam Carolla Podcast.  I subscribed on iTunes his first day. The cancellation of his show hit me hard.  At least hes podcasting. Id be going through Adam withdrawals.  Painful.

I think the podcasts are really good.  Its weird hearing him drop the eff bomb now.  Ive listened to him on terrestrial radio for more than 10 years, no swearing. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090424 17:18:35 nbsp I am simply asking that you not edit my businesses page. Is that too much to ask? I understand that people can edit it if they want at any time. I also understand that the only two people to edit it so far are you and williamlewis and that some alterations were made so that my pages wording could fit a preconceived idea of what a wiki page(which as you say can be made and edits by anyone) should be worded. Please do not edit my site unless there is a good reason.  Users/RealComputers

20090424 18:15:06 nbsp I understand that you anyone CAN change any wiki but that does not mean they HAVE to. Is this a wiki or is it just whats you guys approve? I dont get it, you say anyone can write anything (asuming its appropriate) but i cant have the word we on mine. You guys are super anal if this is how you treat people who are trying to use wiki.  Users/RealComputers

20090424 18:51:24 nbsp Well, I understand the idea of including multiple viewpoints, but I have been unable to find any documentary evidence that supports the idea that UCD is the next flagship campus. We are definitely considered UCs flagship campus for environmental studies (which is noted in all the press releases from UCD that go out on environmental issues), but if we were in the process of transforming into the next UCLA or Berkeley, that would be stated somewhere, either in a UCD press release or some UC Regents reports or something.

20090425 16:38:07 nbsp Im not operating under similar situations as him. I do not think that pages exist for promoting businesses, but thats what hes trying to do. Thats what hes attempting to use the page as. Since he has treated everyone with such contempt, we shouldnt allow him to use the community in such a way. Yes, the wiki loses something by not documenting his business. However, I believe that what is lost is infinitesimal. Users/WilliamLewis

20090514 11:18:16 nbsp My idea was to send the redirect from Organic to Davis, then add several links back to Woodland from the Davis page.  Theres been several comments regarding this on Woodland, and the general consensus seems to be that copypasteing is not the best option in that it... you know Im actually not sure.  But doesnt it seem a better option, considering Woodland wikis size that we cross link topics such as Organic rather than having one on each?  If the general consensus is not, I will gladly help transfer pages over.  I just feel this is more efficient.   Users/MasonMurray

20090703 22:00:16 nbsp I appreciate your comments and sincerity in wanting me to feel welcome, but from that first reaction I can say that I do not. However, I understand that people have used the Wiki in ways that are questionable and undesirable.  May I suggest asking me the validity and goals of said Wiki to understand if it is in fact a business that is simply being made aware to the community before assuming that I have similar motives as another individual.  While I seem to be having to defend my integrity without a proper welcome in the first place, let me clear it up by saying that I fully understand the concept of this community and the need for people to be actively involved (by editing entries, commenting, and so on) for DavisWiki to grow.

Sam

P.S. To clear up the IP address situation. My friend was with me in the same room as I was creating this Wiki. I used her input to help me create the page and she posted an honest review.

20090716 13:27:03 nbsp is a computer diagnostic not a service? Do you not have to pay for a computer diagnostic at other computer shops? Knowing whats wrong with a computer often enables people to fix the problem themselves. Actually quite often. Users/RealComputers

20090716 13:48:43 nbsp As stated, only diagnostics are free. A computer diagnostic is a service, one which you almost always have to pay for. I do not understand your problem with this. Can you exlpain why you are so against having free diagnostics under the free repair and support section? Just the other day I got a call from a guy with a broken laptop monitor. He wanted to do the repair himself but did not where to start. I gave him some advice, told him how to identify his laptops model number aswell as informed him on how to get a new one and what parts he should make sure are included. He was greatful and the service enabled him to get his own repairs underway. I did not charge him. Again, a diagnostic is a service, and I will offer free supprt or advice in the same sense as a free diagnostic. I dont know how to make it anymore clear. A diagnostic is clearly a service that enables users to repair their own machines, and I do it for free.  Users/RealComputers

20090716 13:50:59 nbsp If you want to be technical about it, the support or service is free but not the repair. The section is called free repair and support. I ofer free support.  Users/RealComputers

20090805 18:23:47 nbsp Welcome to the wiki. BTW, I have to scroll down like 5/6 of the way through the page to hit your comment bar. Odd. Users/WilliamLewis

20090806 13:23:04 nbsp I am having an issue. I would appriciate some help. User JimStewart has decided to start leaving comments about things that have nothing at all to do with computer or Real Computers the business on the real computer page. He seems to be unhappy that I restored something he deleted earlier on the computer repair page, which was an edit by williamlewis. I am not asking you to get involved in that, but I think its not appropriate for anyone to leave comments that have nothing to do with the services performed by a business on a business page. I feel, judging by the past, that JimStewart could easily start leaving more comments on that page and I dont want to start an edit war. A simply suggestion from you to him that he leave such comments on a different page, like my user page, would go a long way, asuming you agree that such comments should not be added to a business page.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:28:09 nbsp Yes he is free to edit whatever he want, however that was the result and of a long and drawn out edit war in which many people agreed that the best solution was to have the listing as it is now. Either way, I care more about keeping comments that have nothing to do with business off of business pages.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:29:59 nbsp When I made a wiki account, I did not realize that it would have been better to use my real name at the time. I just wanted to make a business listing. I would have choses a different user name if I had been more familiar with the wiki.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:32:12 nbsp You have offered to help me determine what is appropriate for wiki usage in the past .. I am trying to take you up on that. Do you think it is appropriate for people to write comments on a business page that have nothing at all to do with the business? I know I have made some people not like me in the wiki, not on purpose, but I am just trying to do what I think is right here.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:40:02 nbsp Im sure JimStewart did not comment on the business listing on accident, since he refered to me as the owner or real computers. I do think that having my user account under this name does help when I am actually talking/commenting to someone about computer repair, But I would be happy to change it if people have an issue with it. Thanks for the brief help. Also, I simply just dont think that the listing there is advertisment like, I think it just describes the main services offered, which is what the short descriptions are supposed to do.

20090806 13:46:19 nbsp I may really need your help now. As I feared this is probably going to start an edit war. JoePomidor has taken it upon himself to preserve the personal comment that JimStewart has left. Can you lock the real computer page for a few days or something, without any nonrelevent comments on it? Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:47:34 nbsp Hey...are you going to be returning to Davis any time soon?  Just curious.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20090806 13:49:23 nbsp Jabberwokky .. are you trying to tell me that you think that comment was more than a personal attack? Lets be real for a moment. JimStewart is one of the people who I may have offended unintentionally during some edit wars. You cant honestly believe that his motives are to help the wiki and not to just hurt me, can you? Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:51:41 nbsp Well you are an admin are you not? But I will not ask you for any further help at your request.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 13:54:07 nbsp Well I do care. I will not stand for personal attacks on my business page. If people want to insult me, fine, but not on the real computers page.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 14:04:26 nbsp Yes they have the right to, but that doesnt mean that unrelated business comments/personal attacks belong on a business page. I am not debating that they have the right, I know they have the right, just as I have the right to disagree with comments that have nothing to do with real computers being on the real computers page.  Users/RealComputers

20090806 15:37:59 nbsp Can I ask you for a quick opinion on a nonargumentative issue. I am trying to get a better grasp of what these business pages are supposed to be like. It has been suggested that the real computers page sucks and so I went and took a look at all the other computer repair pages and found that the real computers page seems to be more informative than any other. I figured that was a good thing but maybe the point is not to be informative about specifics?  Users/RealComputers

20090808 13:29:51 nbsp Hah! Or perhaps I should ask if fluffers fold? Either way, Im not into starch. Users/robinlaughlin

20090810 16:04:04 nbsp Yeah, the number certainly caught my eye.  Since I moved, Ive been zippin around LA on a Honda Metro.  A lot of fun, but its essential for my sanity.   Ill weep if splitting lanes ever becomes illegal in CA.  Users/EdWins

20090819 14:14:33 nbsp I believe that if someone is a clear sockpuppet you should just delete all their comments. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20090820 12:59:09 nbsp Could still be useful to have that information all in one place.  Also, looks like Chemistry lists 1.5 research groups, but they are a huge department.  I cant imagine that thats their whole research program! Users/IDoNotExist

20090915 14:29:18 nbsp I love your comment on the CCCC page, although I am astonished that it hasnt collapsed under its own weight into some kind of black hole of commentness. Users/JoePomidor


20090916 20:23:40 nbsp The current situation occurring with the dog trainer brings up a question I meant to ask a while ago.  A friend of mine is a business owner and did not want her page up at all.  She was looking into getting it removed but didnt want to start any sort of issues.  At the least, shed prefer to not have a comments page.  How can she go about making this happen? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090917 11:49:34 nbsp I added information about real computer being unaffiliated with other stores and basically restated what your comments on the page says. Can you please remove your comment? I feel it is very out of place and that it is information that no one needs.  Users/RealComputers

20090921 20:12:21 nbsp I figured as much after looking at some ips, I was gonna let you know tomorrow but your fast Users/StevenDaubert

20090921 23:32:31 nbsp I just wanted to stop by and thank you for all the hard work youre doing keeping the wiki flowing smoothly.  I figure you dont do it for praise or anything, I just wanted to let you know that many people appreciate it. Myself included.  Users/MasonMurray
I concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement  Users/StevenDaubert
  Thanks.  Were all in it together, and everybody adds what they can (with only a very few exceptions over the past years).  :)  jw

20090922 15:06:09 nbsp Thanks!  Ill put each map with their respective areas and such once Im satisfied enough :)  These were the kinds of maps I would have loved to have had during my apartment hunt in Davis.  Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090923 03:27:31 nbsp Books are nice, but isnt the sign in front of the building inherently more authoritative? Maybe there is some cartography cabal of ucd eggheads who are plotting to correct the sign someday soon? :) I think its especially funny whatever the consensus becomes here on the wiki, that its our very own picture contradicting us. I guess thats life with wiki... Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090923 04:02:25 nbsp Seriously though, we have often made decisions on the wiki to rename a page based on a sign in a picture on the page. If the sign is maintained by an authority on the topic of the page (business owner, university administration) then it is authoritative information on the topic. Which doesnt mean anybody needs to pay attention or care about the authority as such, so we should ultimately explain the whole issue and let people decide fully informed. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090923 08:09:38 nbsp Actually the fact that they were able to address me by name while hiding behind a pseudonym and only added profanity sort of proves my point. Users/JasonAller

20090925 14:58:22 nbsp I wanted to post this on the correct page for developers, but I cant remember what the page is called.  This is a method of reducing the impact of malicious users like the ones weve had recently...

Perhaps each time you get reverted by a gnome, you lose the ability to edit for some amount of time. That time starts very small, but doubles each time. Over time, if you are good and dont get reverted, your penalty gets reduced. If you start a revert war and get reverted by gnomes frequently, youll automagically lose your editing ability for quite some time, and the revert war will die almost immediately. Users/IDoNotExist

20090925 23:18:30 nbsp Hmmm...you might be right.  But wouldnt a gnome who reverts maliciously themselves be reverted, or become degnomified?  The penalty system requires trust in a small number of people who have known nonmalicious behavior.  Someone who violates that trust would rapidly not be considered worthy of the penalty producing power. Users/IDoNotExist

20090926 06:25:23 nbsp Hmmm...you could call it something else then.  Something that refers to people who have proven themselves trustworthy over time.  Snapes or Griffens, perhaps.  ;) Users/IDoNotExist

20091012 23:12:38 nbsp Perhaps Users/JonLi/Thomas Kuhns The Structures of Scientific Revolutions key excerpts this page should be black holed, too?  It seems a bit beyond fair use quotations. Users/CovertProfessor

20091013 15:57:02 nbsp I understand.   Users/CovertProfessor

20091018 16:51:33 nbsp Well, I got it 23 weeks ago, before seasonal flu had hit. It started with a rapidly developing fever (which eventually peaked around 103), and also body aches and general fatigue. I talked to an advice nurse through Kaiser, and she said that it was basically assured it was swine flu. They are actually discouraging folk from coming in, unless its an emergency, so I have a feeling that the incidence rate is grossly underreported. Users/JoePomidor

20091028 11:20:00 nbsp I have a business license. Also, please dont remove info about price matching. I have sent comments to the user who left the comments about licensing on the RC page. If he for some reason feels that his comments need to be displayed even though RC despite the fact that I have a business license for real computers, let him voice it himself.  Users/RealComputers

20091028 11:29:41 nbsp You dont have to like me but please erspect my right to remove comments that are state untrue idea directed to hurt my business; especially if they are left by a random person and not someone who has been a customer of mine. I have a business license. If you dont believe me I can prove it to you. Preserving comments that say that I do not have a license is not only confusing but mean spirited and i think you already know that. Ill ask you to do the same as I asked covertprofessor, please stay out of events that have to do with me as much as possible. You dont need to protect people comments or edits without even giving the origional author a chance to do it themselve. You take the control away from the users and that is just not ok. If the user wants his comments maintained, he will indicate. Since they are untrue, I imagine that he would mine and if he does then he is perserving untrue comments purely to try a belittle my business.  Users/RealComputers

20091029 00:06:34 nbsp nice poem on the featured page  an original? Users/TimMatthiessen

20091030 19:32:24 nbsp Sorry, I didnt see that you had banned him when I typed up my comment.  Ill be surprised, though, if a 24 hour ban is enough.  I really do think that he needs to be educated about what the wiki is for.  But as you know, multiple people (including you) have tried to explain it to him multiple times.  I dont know if he just doesnt get it or if he gets it and just doesnt care because his business is all that he cares about.  This is the basis for my suggestion to give him some time to show that he gets the idea of the wiki without being allowed to edit the computer repair pages (though the sockpuppeting today was not promising in that regard), similar to the idea of putting him on probationary status. Users/CovertProfessor

20091031 17:39:21 nbsp Cute! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091101 11:33:29 nbsp I like that noborder look.  Is there a way to do text flow around an image?  That could make the wiki really professional looking... Users/IDoNotExist

20091102 08:24:32 nbsp Why did you delete your nice comment on the ILD page? Users/CovertProfessor

20091102 09:27:24 nbsp Just in the interests of being precise, everything is copyrighted on the wiki. If it werent, our licenses wouldnt work and people could do whatever they wanted with the content.  Users/WilliamLewis

20091102 09:51:47 nbsp To me, what makes Davis a small town is that when I meet someone new, that person generally knows other people I know, or I soon find out that I run into that same person elsewhere.  While its hard to get used to if youve never experienced it before (and I never had), overall I find it quite nice.  Being a small town has its positives and negatives, just as being a large city does.  Personally, I hate large cities. Users/CovertProfessor

2009112 22:17:59 nbsp Jabberwokky? That looked so offkilter, and just weird, Ive bestirred myself to let you know
youve misspelled Jabberwocky (a poem about the Jabberwock actuallywhy you would nickname yourself for a poem about a burbling monster with eyes of flame is material for another comment) as in:

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  And the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
  The frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
  Long time the manxome foe he sought 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The vorpal blade went snickersnack!
He left it dead, and with its head
  He went galumphing back.

And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
  He chortled in his joy.


`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  And the mome raths outgrabe.

20091107 18:19:14 nbsp Eh, not really  Ive just been paying attention to recent events and wanted the wiki to reflect what had happened a little better.

I can see how my request may have been odd and I apologize if it was too demanding.  The intention was never that.

20091203 17:48:04 nbsp Why arent you editing?  We like what you do! Users/IDoNotExist
  Agreed!  Your voice and edits are very much needed around here.  And weve all gotten a bit of negative feedback  thats par for the course as editors disagree, right?   Users/CovertProfessor
    Thanks for the support.  There was a person who was quite thoughtfully negative about the work of active editors (and has been for quite awhile), and so Ive been thinking how will this change be perceived rather than how can I make this entry better when I click edit, and thats not a good mindset to contribute with.  Im not worried about it; Im not swearing off the wiki or anything.  Im just taking it slow for a bit.   jw
     Well, we all need our occasional slow periods.  But remember that not everyone may have agreed with the criticism you received.  cp

20091203 22:46:42 nbsp Has the ban on Brian been lifted? Users/IDoNotExist
  And if so, did it come with conditions?  I for one really need to see him editing pages other than the page for his company.  I think Ill have to go away from the wiki for awhile myself if he starts obsessively fiddling, fiddling, fiddling with that page and the general computer repair page again.  Users/CovertProfessor
    Thats pretty much up to the community and what it will tolerate.  Yes, his account is off the ban list.  Im loathe (but not unwilling) to enforce a permanent ban on a member of the Davis community who seems to not be malicious or willfully ignorant and who has not prompted a clear and active community consensus for a permanent ban.  An increasing length of time to temporary bans will admittedly turn into a de facto permanent ban.  As a side note, I also removed three CA Comcast IPs from the block list.  jw
     I agree that hes shown little sign of maliciousness.  Whether he is willfully ignorant... well, we shall see.  cp

20091204 16:15:32 nbsp Thanks for removing the spam on my user page from 11/6. I dont visit DWiki that much anymore. Users/TusharRawat

   Thanks.  It was a quick edit on the way out the door as I was standing there while Sarah collected a few things.  I was trying to keep things lighthearted while I was in pain.  I just walked back in the door, having had a CAT scan and an IV with morphine and some other pain med.  Turns out that, yes, it was a kidney stone, and Ill be fine.  I also had an infection, so Ive got some minor followup scheduled.  Its been an utterly amazingly painful couple of hours, and its something Ill never wish on anybody else.  I also now seriously respect how well pain medication works (and how wonderful my wife is).  In short: Kidney stones BAD.  jw

20091213 18:12:01 nbsp Thanks. On the Solo Dining link being removed, I had assumed it had just gotten removed during the revert from the other spam posts, but thanks for the howto on checking the changelog. I figured I should readd it to the main page so hopefully more people will see it in the longterm and contribute to it, but I understand where you guys are coming from.

20100110 13:18:02 nbsp Why link to frozen yogurt on the businesses that sell ice cream, rather than ice cream? Users/CovertProfessor

20100110 17:45:48 nbsp Thank you!  It just occurred to me that there is also gelato.  Do you think we need a frozen desserts page, or is that overkill?  I did create a desserts page awhile back, but that is pretty bare bones, so maybe frozen desserts is overkill. Users/CovertProfessor

20100110 18:51:59 nbsp Right, I created that dessert page.  Just forgotten what Id called it.  See, dessert is high priority.  As far as I am concerned, it is relevant to all the wiki pages.  But I make an effort to control myself. Users/CovertProfessor

20100110 19:50:33 nbsp Ah, ok.  I think I misunderstood your original motivation.  When I saw you linking to frozen yogurt from businesses whose primary product is ice cream, I thought ah, JW thinks that someone looking for ice cream might also be interested in frozen yogurt.  (I see now that that was not your intent  I think I missed the first comment that you left on my page today).  So then I thought, well, if you are interested in ice cream, you might also be interested in gelato  or, more generally, given interest any one of them, you might be interested in the other two.

So, now that Ive done it, what do you think?  It makes sense to me from the point of view of someone looking for something sweet and cold on a hot summer day. Users/CovertProfessor

20100110 20:33:51 nbsp I think it makes sense the way it is now, my original puzzlement notwithstanding.  I think its clear enough that its just a general comment about where to find more info on the cold, sweet stuff.  Plus it appeals to my sense of fairness that each points to the others.  Maybe its because I wouldnt mind, e.g., someone looking at the Baskin Robbins page discovering that there is a really cool gelato place just a couple of blocks away. Users/CovertProfessor

20100112 08:13:40 nbsp Did you mean a new person might prefer to use a comment box on Users/kimthegoodtwin? I dont disagree, but Im curious. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100113 18:09:15 nbsp Perhaps this is from a work computer at that place, but Jacqueline is http://daviswiki.org/Users/Jacquelyn9?actionuserinfo editing from the same IP as former noted shills/sockpuppets such as http://daviswiki.org/Users/LMarie?actionuserinfo this person who had a small convo (of some sort) with Jason, and this http://daviswiki.org/Users/CGovers?actionuserinfo account.  Users/EdWins

20100113 18:18:54 nbsp I added a comment to the talk page to make it a bigger discussion within the community  my assumption is that its likely a shared work computer, as theres actually three other editors with singlepurpose accounts coming from it. Guess I thought of sharing with you first since you always do the hardtodo personal outreach. Cheers! Users/EdWins

20100115 16:33:00 nbsp Thanks.  Given the comments on the other pages, it seems like there is some hope for him/her becoming a more productive wikizen. Users/CovertProfessor

JabberWokky publishes and syndicates coupons for a living (using a wiki engine, no less)... and so is staying out of {{{Bounty and Savings/Talk this discussion}}} (at least directly).  But he thinks its interesting to watch, and is curious nobody has raised the factFootnote(Hopefully this fact is less about coupons and more about wiki content) that the links are more designed to promote a secondary resource (the blog) rather than linking to the actual coupons and therefore connecting the community entry to the resource (coupon) itself.  With DLM, there is direct value from interviews and research (a la an Enterprise, SNR or SacBee link).  This is more like linking to an LJ post that links to an SNR article.

20100119 09:30:45 nbsp Hello. I have a small favor to ask. I added a small bit of info to the real computers page next to my phone number and I was hoping you could edit it to make the format/asthetics better, as I dont really know how to do that and I figure it would only take you a second.

20100121 12:21:10 nbsp Hello. I have an ussie that I would like some help with. Recently a customer left a comment/review on the real computer site that states that I deleted a years worth of data from her computer. This is 100% untrue however, I saved all of her files and infact still have them on my computer. She thinks that I deleted her emails but in reality she just needed to setup outlook again. This person is just old and knows basically nothing about computers, and there fore left a completely inaccurate account of what happened to her computer. I do not have this customers phone number or I would call her, explain the situation to her and ask her to remove her comment, and I dont think she is ever going to log in to daviswiki to see that I replied to her commment. I was hoping I could remove it from the page. If she does log in again and decides to readd it the I will not touch it but I dont think I should have to preserve a customers rant about how little confused they are, which is all this is because the customers documents were backed up in full including her emails. basically I am asking because I feel that it would be totally fine to remove because in reality I did save all of her data and can prove it, but I dont want to start and edit war here so please let me know your opinion on this.

20100121 12:29:26 nbsp I did reply and explain the situation but I still dont think that it needs to remain. It is simply a canse where a customer was confused about what happened to her computer, but I did not delete any of her data and I dont want other customers to think that that might happen. It has never happened. I mean, it is 100% untrue .. I really think I should be able to remove it. Its not to anyone benifit to have to read through the the whole thing because if they do they will just find that a customer was confused and thats all. Its not helpful info to anyone, But I was going to add some info in its place. Some kind of warning to people that if they have me reinstall windows on their computer, that means they will have to reconfigure a lot of stuff even though their files are all saved. Thats really all that could be benificial from this occurance.  Users/RealComputers

2000 would be a little bit before my time. Ive been a certified Magic Judge since 2004. My name is Riki Hayashi and if you dig around on the Internet you will find that have written over 150 articles on the game for various strategy sites. Most recently those articles have pertained to the judging side of things, and in that vein I find that using precise terminology is very important to avoid confusion and to educate players. Given that many Magic players will recognize me as Risky, I chose to emphasize the things like officiating that would resonate with my
I picked up the nickname Risky sometime around 200001. I think I started using it as my online name around 2002. Many Magic players who Ive gotten to know first through the Internet call me Risky.

20100127 11:50:00 nbsp By the way sorry if this is a bit of a contrary post, but I have a pet peeve regarding people who think any joke, however lacking in wit or inventiveness, is funny, so long as it involves a reference with a sufficiently narrow audience. I see the humor in the 2600 joke, and if it were the only one youd tried to explain to me I wouldnt be here, but I remember feeling a similar annoyance when you came to my page to explain the Wishburger joke. I also got that one, but the joke wasnt really relevent the fact is, the information regarding the wishburger was inaccurate, and a wishburger was never a secret item on the InnOut menu (regardless of how funny it would be if it were.) I let that one go at the time to avoid seeming like an ass, but I hope youll understand I dont want this to be a regular thing, you explaining helpfully that things are funny because theyre a reference to something else.

20100127 17:27:47 nbsp Ah... again. Im sorry. Id say lets start over, but Ill probably be an ass again in the future sometime, so well just start over after that one :P Not that I like being an ass, but you know... I havent figured out a good way not to be once in awhile. Anyway, as you seem to be already aware, my generation generally regards geek as a neutral or even positive quality, and thats how I meant it in my discussion page; it hadnt occurred to me that it would be considered an insult. And thank you and anyone who helped you for your work on the featured page. Its not the reason Im apologizing, but its awesome nonetheless. As far as the name of the school, it is Montessori Country Day (I havent read the talk page and only skimmed the feature, it looks like you got some of it figured out after your last post on my page). I dont know much about it other than what I found on the web; I emailed my friend who has children there and asked her to either edit the page or send me more information about it, if she knows anything. So... time to relax a little bit and stop complaining about everyone, I guess.

20100209 18:33:58 nbsp I think that the page needs some reorganizing. The general information should stay at the top, then the history and depledging information, and finally the pros and cons. I started trying to organize everything in my head and realized that this might take longer than I originally planned because some of the information there is in need of citation, which might be difficult because proving that the organization really did bring about their successes is not very easy (of course removing the ones that cannot be proven I feel would reflect my personal bias).

JABBERWOCKY
(from Through the LookingGlass and What Alice Found There, 1872)

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

All mimsy were the borogoves,

      And the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

      The frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand:

      Long time the manxome foe he sought —

So rested he by the Tumtum tree,

      And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,

      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,

Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,

      And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through

      The vorpal blade went snickersnack!

He left it dead, and with its head

      He went galumphing back.

And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?

      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!

O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!

      He chortled in his joy.

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;

All mimsy were the borogoves,

      And the mome raths outgrabe.

20100212 09:18:58 nbsp Your right about the tea list, I didnt notice that they didnt capitalize (on purpose I guess)  btw.  I thought it would be interesting to note that there was a band by the name of Blade Fetish  in my hometown of Santa Barbara, they only had one album entitled Absinthe (around 1993) and they had a song called Jabberwokky where they just sang the lyrics to the poem to music.  The music is droning goth heavy metal, but still a pretty interesting song.  See if you can find an mp3 on the internet, if not I could try to email it to you.  I always did like the poem, it is the only poem I ever took the time to memorize.  I hope you have also seen the Terry Gilliam movie Jabberwokky  I was always fond of that film. Users/DagonJones

20100314 21:08:16 nbsp http://theaggie.org/article/2010/03/12/chpreversesstatementontaseruseatcampusprotest The Aggie has the taser story. Where did the CHP say they used drive stun before that? I only recall seeing the whole aimed but not deployed because of a malfunction thing. Users/WilliamLewis
  I can not recall, but I distinctly remember it.  Quite possibly the SacBee live reporting chat room, which I can not find (and may not be online, which seems stupid).  Using a taser is a term subject to interpretation, as it generally means firing it, which they didnt do.  On the flip side, its highly questionable to say that none was used when one was used in drive stun mode.  I wish we could find the actual press releases or primary statements.  Bleah.  jw

20100314 21:12:23 nbsp Todays paper, front page: Contrary to its earlier accounts, the California Highway Patrol on Friday said an officer used a Taser on March 4 as police attempted to bar student protesters from Interstate 80.
A UC Davis student on the receiving end of that shock says she understands police were within their rights, but questioned why the CHP first said no Tasers were used.  She also said she feels sure other students were shocked with Tasers...
cont. on A11: ...one officer used a Taser to shock a protester with a drive stun: holding the weapon against the protester instead of firing darts and delivering the jolt through wires.
The same officer later tried to use the Taser again, but it malfunctioned, Williford said.

The person shocked was identified as Natalie Nadimi, and the article says she received jolts on the right arm, near her right ear and on her upper chest, she said.  She fell down and had trouble catching her breath.

Ok, gotta go now... hope that helps. Users/CovertProfessor
  Yes.  Have you seen anywhere the original statement that the CHP issued that denied a taser was used?  Im curious as to if the wording was misinterpreted by the press, if it is misleading as written or if it is simply outright incorrect (I want to say deceitful, but with them aware that the press plus a ton of cameras were there watching the whole thing, I cant imagine it could possibly be intentional deceit... if so, its not only deceit, but a case of horrifying stupidity, too).  On the other hand, a quick polling of involved officers with one person saying I tried to use my taser, but it malfunctioned could reasonably lead to an official statement that none was used.  Fuzzy and uncertain second hand reports with no primary statements available to the public and some of the news quickly vanishing into the ether as live reports close and articles are rewritten as events occurred.  I thought this whole internet thing would make things better.  ;)  jw
   Heres more of the article:  CHP Officer Marvin Williford said reporters were incorrectly told no Tasers were used because while the use of the Taser was recorded on the official report of the incident, it wasnt brought to the attention of the officers who deal with the media until later.
  CHP issued the news release Friday after the campus student newspaper, the California Aggie, and AggieTV produced photographs and video showing Nadimi being shocked.

I will give you my opinion based on what I can see from the films, of course it will be limited because there is often decay that can be seen visually but not on xrays.  also if you can tell me the type of fills that are recommended, they should look like #3 MO  or O or MOD  etc.  I would not worry too much about the bad reviews, even great dentists get some of those.

Let me spread my knowledge out, however discrete it may be. Users/RickJames

20101001 14:28:45 nbsp Oh.  The thing said it was reverted back to what it was before and as I saw it, which was to answer NO to everything.  It doesnt look good if you say that, especially since advice on answering those questions is banned from gun stores.  I dont think we want to be promoting gun ownership to people who cant answer for themselves on whether or not they are felons or mentally handicapped.  Thats what happened at that Virgina college.  The kid was lead on what to answer on the DROS forms, which then gave him access to a firearm.  If he had answered on his own, he may have answered truthfully and been forever denied a handgun.  I look at the edit as a safety issue. Users/RickJames

20101001 14:34:27 nbsp I agree with Rick James, bitch!  I mean, Evan.  While saying, answer NO on everything or youre screwed or dont bother doesnt actually tell anyone to lie on forms, it does sort of encourage it.  Public safety, keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous types, whatever the reason, I think its better to avoid suggesting that if you want a gun, you should answer NO to all of the questions. Users/TomGarberson
  I thought the store has to submit a background check request to the police who make sure the person is not lying on the form, so lying would not do any good anyway... Users/hankim

20101001 14:52:56 nbsp The problem is that people will read it as a way to cheat the system.  Theyll see it as if I answer all No, then Ill get a gun! rather than I can answer all No, therefore I can get a gun.  Its a subtle difference that speaks a lot. Users/RickJames

20101001 14:57:06 nbsp I read it a bit differently.  The actual text: Make sure to answer NO to the Yes/No questions (e.g. Have you ever been judged mentally incompetent? NO... Have you ever been convicted of a felony? NO...) Unless of course the answer is Yes. If it is, just leave. You cant buy a gun.  Maybe Im just cynical, but to me, it reads as first instructing you to fill it out in the negative, and second, explaining why the answer should be negative.  Theres a nod there to the idea that you should tell the truth, but it comes across as secondary to the main instruction (answer No).  Again, though, thats just my interpretation.  If it remains in its prior form, I think it should at least be accompanied with a warning that lying on the form is a felony. Users/TomGarberson

20101012 12:10:09 nbsp Good idea?  Not sure, I guess... I like the idea of having a compilation somewhere of people and businesses that helped shape Davis in its early days, though.  Plus, we have a lot of orphaned pages for historical people places that dont really fit anywhere else.  If they just get dumped into People or Departed Businesses, theyll essentially just disappear.  Im certainly open to other ideas.  This just seemed like a good way to compile some of that stuff, tie it into town history, and solve the whole orphaning thing. Users/TomGarberson
 I started a talk page for it to get ideas: HistoricDavis/Talk tg

20101012 12:52:32 nbsp Very good point re: photo requests.  My thought with this was more of a compilation, rather than a request for action, though.  Just crosslinking with town history (or a subpage) might be an alternative, making a list or set of lists manually.  Its twice as many edits, though, and Im not sure the result would be very different.  I also think it would be a shame to leave those pages floating in a relatively unconnected manner.  If we had more information on birth/death dates and dates of establishment/closure, putting them directly into the Davis Timeline would be really cool.  Based on what weve got, though, thats not really practical. Users/TomGarberson

20101012 13:42:47 nbsp Re: unknown set of years and narrowing things to a decade or individual year: that would probably work for getting the links in one place.  Itd be a beast to get it organized and make it look remotely decent, though.  In most cases, Jason included a year during which the people/places were extant, but existed during is a pretty difficult standard to work with on a timeline.  If topics were extant during more than one decade, do they appear in the unknown page for all relevant decades?  How do we sort date ranges if we know Item A was extant during 19141917, Item B was extant during 19131921, and Item C was extant during 19141920, but not whether any of them existed before or after that date?  It seems like you either come down to individual date headers for each item, or no headings, with a listing of items individually, much like an include list.

It seems to me that for uncertainties like that, it would be much easier to have an early Davis category or set of categories, by whatever name, to collect interesting people and places from Daviss early days.  If the terminology is too amorphous, it would be easy enough to set a somewhat arbitrary cutoff for the sake of simplicity.  1917, when City of Davis was incorporated; 1933, when population exploded in town due to the institution of a 4year degree program at University Farm; 1941, with the start of WWII.  Whatever. Users/TomGarberson

20101012 14:18:21 nbsp Ive only done a few orphaned pages so far.  I havent around for other stuff (or even finished the orphaned list). Users/TomGarberson

20101013 11:55:35 nbsp Personal, working (in flux) thoughts:

  Pink: Permanent Notice that is part of content.  Establishes the context before you read the rest of the page.
  Yellow: Major content notice (editor info that affects the whole entry) OR review toppers (HIPAA, etc., because pink would visually dominate too much)
  Yellow/Blue: Minor content notice (typically inline, or referring to one aspect of the entry, a discussion thread, two suspicious comments, etc) Users/JabberWokky

20101013 13:01:42 nbsp Since youre going gangbusters on cleaning up the includes, I thought I might mention one possible sort of include that crops up from time to time when a business has not quite closed, but has changed form enough to warrant a new page.  The business owner understandably gets upset if there is a departed business banner, or even the no longer exists banner.  So, what weve done (I think youve done some of these, too) is to create an ad hoc banner, such as the one that is on Angies Beauty Salon or Monticello Bistro (to name two Ive done recently).  What is key about these, I think, is that they link to the new business.  That makes it hard to create a generic include for such cases.  Can you think of a neater way to handle this, or do we just continue to make the ad hoc ones when we need to? Users/CovertProfessor
  How about an include with a moving van picture that explains that the business has either moved or changed its name and we can keep it general by keeping the details of the move or rename in the main body and then have the include tell the reader to scroll down? Users/hankim

20101013 13:15:45 nbsp That sounds promising. Users/CovertProfessor

20101013 17:08:47 nbsp I like the new pics for the includes.  A lot.  It might even be love... Im just so confused!  As for the parrot vs. dodo, I like (love?  gah!) both. Users/TomGarberson

20101013 17:45:07 nbsp The more birds on the wiki, the better. If it were a Carolina parakeet, it would be even more appropriate! Users/WilliamLewis

20101014 08:28:02 nbsp If I can resize the dodo, and make the background pink and all that then I think it would look good but as it stands the parrot looks much nicer.  I had to look up its metabolic processes are known only to historians to figure out what the reference was.  Clearly I need to brush up on my Monty Python. Users/DagonJones

  I dont disagree.  How are you planning to foster a positive resolution?  Demands seldom work well within a community of equals.  jw
  See the new discussion you opened for further comments. PeteB

20101018 21:00:00 nbsp (sorry putting this here now and going home to bed) My recommendation to deal with this in a positive manner is rather clear...simply dont allow the war to continue here. Its not productive for either side and the needed appropriate info is simply not being communicated in this medium. Reneng really needs to call the office and speak to them directly about the issue.  Users/PeterBoulay
  Yup. As I said, I dont disagree with that. jw

20101018 21:52:02 nbsp Yeah, I figured that out reading back over todays edits on the page.  Thanks for clarifying. Users/TomGarberson

20101019 12:57:02 nbsp JWstrongly recommend locking the  page to avoid his persistent habit of making legal threatsits not good for the Wiki. Users/PeterBoulay
 In a general sense, I agree.  We dont want legal threats on the wiki, but in my mind, thats mostly because of the deterrent effect thatll have on users.  In this particular case, that isnt an issue.  Im extremely curious to see how far hell take this. Users/TomGarberson
 Davis is full of  interesting  people.  Pretty much every community is.  Just let it go.  Theres no real damage being done to the wiki  just a couple oddball comments on user profiles  and Tom doesnt seem to mind.  If he does, hes perfectly capable of knowing how to voice his concern.  The Front Page is the wiki, not Recent Changes.  Although... Tom, please dont push it to the point where it becomes an actual issue.  Even if it is making you curious.  Escalation is a bad thing, mkay?  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

   Not true JW...I have received a couple emails over the past few hours from people asking why this is being allowed to continuepeople from Davis. Users/PeterBoulay

   God forbid you get an elderly person or one with a disability who needs a car to get around. This would make Davis nonliveable for them. Users/PeterBoulay
    Campus has made it work pretty well and is a much larger area (I think) than downtown.  Thered need to be more/better parking around downtown, and probably a new bus depot with additional routes connecting it with surrounding areas.  If you have a system for bringing in delivery vehicles, you can easily adapt it for handicapped access as well, I would think. Users/TomGarberson

what will the community decide if she never calls or responds? Users/DavidPlacencia

20110321 18:22:49 nbsp Please see the Wiki Community/Accusations/Talk page. Users/WesP

20110321 21:44:17 nbsp This is a reason I made the proposal/discussion page to begin with. I know for a fact there are more intelligent people out there (not an admission of being a cybermoron) who might be able to come up with better ideas.  I love the DavisWiki (insert obvious statement) but am tired, as many are, of the constant degradation of valid discussion turning into cyberbattles over opinion.   I know we can find a way to work together. After all, we all worked together to get the Wiki this far. Users/WesP

20110321 21:52:19 nbsp I tend to agree with the poll vs. votes aspect. A time constraint is also somewhat important as it doesnt take much to mar a reputation. On the flipside though, if the accusation were to be validated, we would want it to be made public as quickly as possible to allow people to make a genuinely informed decision as well. Users/WesP

20110321 22:05:30 nbsp It is my opinion (and only this for better or worse) that our little experiment only proves the point that we need to find a solution to the problem as a community.  One individual making the choice (by making an accusation or deleting a page/comment/partial comment) has too much power. Two individuals would only occasionally find neutral territory to decide. Three would often be decided upon by who the third tends to agree with most often. It has to be the community as a whole, with some type of time constraint. Users/WesP

20110321 22:27:03 nbsp Love the alterations to the Wiki Community/Accusations page. Users/WesP

20110321 22:33:14 nbsp After looking at recent changes every couple of hours tonight, I really hope the new wiki software has a means of tracking edits by multiple editors across multiple pages.  There seem to be interlocked conversations taking place on about 10 or 12 different pages tonight. Users/TomGarberson

20110322 00:12:52 nbsp No problem  Im all for free speech of course, but the hostility in his previous comments toward other users is downright scary, figured he could use a reminder. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110323 19:18:07 nbsp It was a really interesting article on the song Fridays social commentary about how Americans are addicted to oil because we are constantly kicking in the front seat and sitting in the back seat, and all that gas wasted while we decide which seat to take, but it really did not have anything to do with the Rebecca Black here in Davis. Users/hankim

20110324 10:14:43 nbsp Its gratifying to find another (former) watcher of Better Off Ted. Users/JoePomidor

20110325 11:29:28 nbsp So true.   I dont know ho Jason could do all the deletions and still be a part of other things (read cab dramas). I have been far too active on the Wiki lately, at least more active than before... burnout is an appropriate term for now.

Glad its so nice in Tenn., the weather here has been absolutely dreadful lately.  Take care man, hope you have a great weekend. Users/WesP

20110325 11:55:04 nbsp Hey Jabberwokky, Im sorry about all my clients posting on one time accounts.  Its actually getting kind of embarrassing at this point.  Im going to start encouraging them to do more edits now that they know how!   Users/Davidlm

20110327 06:47:21 nbsp Thanks for your help (and fast, as it is often) with Friendly Cab/Talk.  Thanks to the others too. Users/BruceHansen

20110327 10:57:34 nbsp I dont think its a double standard, its apples and oranges.  Businesses by default are wiki noteworthy, and so I think employees tend to generally be considered extensions or representatives of said company.  As an example, at Monticello it seems Rhonda is clearly the face of the restaurant, as a lot of comments are about her.  This is because of her association with the place.  I dont think the inverse is true, regarding calling out clients.  Mostly because unlike a business employee, a client is a standalone unit.  Simply put, eating dinner at XYZ or watching a movie or whatever isnt in and of itself, noteworthy and wouldnt warrant importance enough to be a wiki page.  Now, clearly there are bound to be exceptions of noteworthiness, and I think thats the real issue here (not a supposed double standard). If someone went buckwild and there was an article about it in the Enterprise or the Aggie...probably people might argue for it being on the wiki.  The real question Im seeing here is what type of source and level of reporting is necessary.  Does it have to be in a newspaper or blog of some level of importance?  Or do secondhand stories which some allege are close to heresay qualify?  Some businesses do have do not serve or dont accept checks from or these people are banned lists.  Would the wiki be ok with them making that information public? I have no idea, but one day those particular issues might pop up.

Im generally fine with people upset at an employee/business (when youre at work, you represent the company) as long as they stay away from the personal attacks. Im not comfortable with the inverse of calling out a random client, in general.  There have been times people have complained about a stylist or restaurant and then theyve been called out by said stylist/waiter in a response to their comment.  But I dont think Ive seen the business throw the first stone, really. And although this word is tossed up way too often on the wiki (libel), this is one of the few times Ive considered whether a party could allege it and not just be completely wrong.  In this case specifically, the stone throw is rather direct and the facebook link is in my eyes obviously only included with malignant intent (justified or not).  Users/EdWins
    I think Joshs intent is only halfmalignant. On one hand I think he wants to punish the girl; on the other hand, I think he legitimately wants to protect other local cab drivers from her by posting her name and likneness.  But it still amounts to hearsay because he didnt experience the incident directly so its a bad precedent to allow. SM

20110327 21:31:38 nbsp You are indeed very ecumenical. When I replied to you, I was referring to the collective voice of the Wiki as it has been expressed on Talk pages over the last few years. What you and I think has often not ended up being the outcome. There have been three discussions in the last couple of weeks that have gone in rather different directions. I have some hope about this, but.... Users/DonShor

20110327 22:12:21 nbsp I am all for main content being edited all the time, but I personally think comments (even though they are despised by most) should be unedited most of the time. I always thought of them as interviews or something with the locals or whatnot regarding a topic on the Wiki. Also, I know integration is always preferred, but I think comments are pretty darn important when it comes to opinionated content that people cannot come to a compromise on. For the primary source being in the history, my only problem with that is that nobody ever really looks at the history unless the user is a regular. Users/hankim

20110328 00:02:33 nbsp I think culling the wiki is usually pretty wrong, removing stuff just because there is apparently too much. Sometimes we need to remove things because they shouldnt be on the wiki in the first place, but I think just removing instead of rearranging is wrong. Yes this is more raw material as you say for other pages than easily readable itself, but being raw material doesnt make it good to delete either. Why not just keep it? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110328 00:31:12 nbsp Looking at deleting stuff on the wiki in the way of wikipedia, with deletionism vs inclusionism, we have a really useful test which is to ask if it is about Davis or not. I know the insane scope of wikipedia was one reason wikia was started, but Daviswiki already has a pretty limited and useful scope, I dont think it needs to be more limited than it already is. I think that crazy long debates about weird stuff are totally on topic for the wiki and do belong here, its just the way Davis is. Users/NickSchmalenberger
