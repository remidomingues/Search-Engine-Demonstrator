20110328 00:44:42 nbsp Lol! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110328 14:25:59 nbsp re: your comment on my page, thats a very good point and one that I didnt consider.  I agree that once youre out there, youre out there (nice photograph example,  I liked it). (and from here on I go in a completely different direction than your comment was about...)  However, I think theres still a disconnect when we talk about general notability on the wiki, as a practical thing.  If its a random Joe Schmoe doing something crazy, its hard to kind of fit that onto a wiki page.  Check out this pic of this random guy doesnt usually lend itself to a wiki page.  Maybe it will, I certainly think it can, but I dont think it has been for the most part.  If its an employee of a business doing something, it very quickly gets linked to the business. Thats not necessarily fair, but it seems to be a pretty common theme that while at work/on duty/in the uniform, whatever, you represent or are an extension of the business.  Its why so many people are censured/quit/fired for things some of them do on their own time while not even in uniform  a lot of places have a relatively strict code of content, on and off hours, and if you make the company look bad youre taking a big risk.   More specifically, if someone got a picture of an employee in a Blockbusters shirt and name tag getting drunk every now and then at G Street and then peeing on the sidewalk in broad daylight...thatll certainly attract a lot more attention, specifically to Blockbusters as a company, than the same picture of a random unknown undergrad.  Practically, its a lot easier to fit that picture onto the wiki than fit the same picture of an unknown guy.   The question being raised in my mind by those types of pictures is really the business association with the action, rather than the action itself, which isnt fair  but simply one of the ways the world often is. Hell, theres at least half a dozen examples in the news the last few months in which people have resigned or been fired based on something they said off the record which was inappropriate.  Its only noteworthy due to their position within or association with some organization/company.  And I guess thats kind of my overall point/thoughtrambles.  edit: to add more, I dont think thats necessarily too unfair thinking of the other side.  Many local businesses seem pretty proud to show community support or any number of good deeds that support the city and its people.  A picture of the drunk employee peeing in public has more notability and potential wiki worth due to the businesses ties within the community   it damages their neighborly status and reputation. To say the least, its a bit of a PR problem, whereas the random undergrad is unlinked to any specific thing and is only notable as an action being gross/wrong.  Theres more depth to the employee, because theyd ultimately be considered the extension/representative for the company.   More rambled thoughts, I guess.  Apologies for the stream of unconsciousness.  Id rather do anything right now than work on what needs to be done.  Users/EdWins

20110418 19:19:09 nbsp Totally actually. http://jama.amaassn.org/content/275/20/1590.abstract High blood pressure from sodium consumption only occurs within a small percentage of the population. Too much salt can lead to water retention and bloating, but just the right amount (a pinch or two on your potatoes or whatever) can help prevent dizziness and muscle cramps during a workout. If you sweat excessively like I do, proper salt consumption can even prevent diarrhea.  Users/hankim

20110420 13:36:41 nbsp I know what you mean. Spokespeople are very good at using careful language so you can interpret them a certain way without them technically lying. So if they say were checking into the allegations, youd think that means they didnt hear about them until now, when it might be possible they just never followed through the first time. Or the UCD spokesperson saying I was unaware of such a complaint could mean the letter was filed, but not with him and he didnt know until now. Or, maybe they never did receive it but you would think they would say that very clearly if that were true... I guess I have a cynical view of the whole thing though. Users/MeggoWaffle

Users/TomGarberson

20110424 23:38:20 nbsp I can try to answer your question, but before I do I need to get unstuck about the http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unfounded?r75 unfounded part.  How do we know it was unfounded?  Even if the witness isnt sure if something bad happened or not, perhaps something bad did happen.  Is it still unfounded if something bad did in fact happen? Users/CovertProfessor

20110425 00:06:06 nbsp I think Ill be able to think about this more clearly after a nights sleep... Ill try to write something then... Users/CovertProfessor

20110425 15:26:31 nbsp I am still trying to sort your your recent comments on my page, but I think this is whats going on.  Lets leave out the term unfounded, which I think we may be using differently.  There are stories that are internally inconsistent or lack content at all (fluffy).  I agree that those have no place on the wiki.  I think we both agree that personal attacks (ad hominems) have no place on the wiki either.  Then there are stories for which little evidence is provided, perhaps even with the teller admitting that he or she lacks complete evidence.  (I think those are the stories that you are calling unfounded; again, I think thats a misleading choice of words because it implies that the story is false or without foundation).  Lets call those stories thin.  Then I think that we have to consider whether, if the thin story were true, the repetition of the behavior on which the story was based would cause harm.  If so, then I think there is reason to keep it on the wiki.  However, I think there is also reason to point out the thinness of the evidence, any other mitigating circumstances, and testimony that seems to suggest that the accused otherwise behaves in an exemplary way.  Does that answer your question?? Users/CovertProfessor

20110515 21:56:35 nbsp I will not interact with William. Make him stop, please. You can contact me offWiki if you want to discuss this further. William is a detriment to the Davis Wiki. Users/DonShor

20110515 22:26:24 nbsp There is nothing to be decided here. The page must go. Disagree at your own peril. Its your time to waste. It is my understanding that the Davis Wiki is governed by a collaborative process of editors working together. Anyone who makes statements such as I have just quoted is not working with other editors. He is acting by fiat, and imperiously reverting anyone who disagrees with him. He then insults the other editors, repeatedly, and continues to revert. That is not acceptable behavior on the Davis Wiki. William has done this so many times, it is beyond an aberration. It is long past time for him to be removed from the Davis Wiki. Users/DonShor
 You know, if youre going to quote me, at least provide the context so people know what I actually said. What preceded your quote of me is as follows: If you want to argue about this and revert it back, fine. Its just going to be Bruce not getting it while tons of people try to explain why this page does not and never will work. Im tired of these things going on and people talking the issue to death. The point Im stating: http://daviswiki.org/Station/Talk?actioninfo this has gone on for months. Nobody but Bruce knows whats going on with the page. There are many irreparable flaws with the entire idea of the page pointed out by different people. Further discussion is pointless. Not that Im going to shut it down if it occurs (nor could I, even if I wanted to), but Im pointing out the obvious at this point that there is nothing more to say. I deleted the page, for which there is more than enough community support to do so, as a way to bring this issue to a close with less mess.

 I do not act by fiat or operate under the assumption that I own the wiki. I abide by community consensus where it exists, even if I think the result is undesirable or inconsistent with how the wiki has operated in the past. Im not going to go back and analyze all of my reversions Ive made on this wiki and others (there are close to 2000), but I can tell you now that they fall into several broad categories. Most of my reversions are undoing spam or other edits that are undisputedly abuse. Another large category or reversions are to undo things that perhaps could be argued, but are abuse under current wiki norms. For example, removing supported critical content or adding obvious astroturfing are against wiki norms, but the wiki has found this appropriate in some situations. Sometimes Ive done these reversions while discussion of the content is ongoing because the current state of the page is unacceptable under current community standards. Ive never engaged in reversions when the community consensus has dictated an outcome different from the one I advocated for.

 Its ironic that you accuse me of not working with the community when you yourself openly refuse to engage with me in any way. Im perfectly willing to work with you and I always have. Its time to get over your grudge, Don. That means no more ad hominem reversions restoring indefensible content simply because you dont like the way I work. It also means you have to be willing to discuss things with me and respond to my messages instead of deleting them without even a response.

 I am puzzled by your comment that I insult other editors. I am careful to attack arguments, actions, and alleged statements of fact, not people. Im sure Ive let a few drop here and there over the course of my nearly 10,000 edits, but those have been aimed at spammers, vandals, and editors like Ostrowski who were simply acting ridiculous. I would appreciate it if you would clarify and provide examples of insults that Ive thrown, be they in the categories Ive named (which I find acceptable, sorry) or otherwise. Users/WilliamLewis

20110515 23:28:10 nbsp I think the thing about station is less about the page than it really is about confusion over wiki usage.  Or to put it in the bet way, a unique perspective? An alternate vision?  I think several people have noticed that a lot of his edits focus on the wiki specifically. Especeially regarding links.

20110515 23:34:42 nbsp Hate this smartphone, comment attempt 4.  Base issue IMO is that hes trying to smooth the wiki out, and increase interwiki links with colored commentary/prose/poems depending on the page.  Everyone else sees it as useless packing material.

Human beings are influenced by interest (per Ben Franklin) and animals are influenced by instinct.  I think you are confusing love and hate as we humans use it.  These ducks are birds and they eat bread due to instinct, not love.  I wrote that they hate bread because they will die (a) from choking on the bread, (b) will die after the bread impacts their crops, or (c) will get sick and then die from predation.

 Users/EdWins

20110607 15:29:54 nbsp Yeah, I could talk your ear off about that one.  I think there has been a very unhealthy shift in the last 20 years or so from college students thinking of themselves as adults to college students thinking of themselves... not as children, of course (I was being a bit over the top) but as guys and girls who are not quite yet adults.  Thats not to say that students of >20 years ago were any more responsible  they werent.  But there was some recognition that they should be trying to get their act together.  And I am really just baffled about the old man stuff.  Students are more insular at UCD than I thought (and I only date frat guys?? pardon me while I throw up).  At other universities, students who are not 1822 are more common, and throughout history, women in their early 20s have been involved with men in their 30s.  You make a fair point about the leap to sexual predator but I question the first step in the chain altogether!  Glad to hear that I am not losing my mind, or at least that I have company. Users/CovertProfessor
   at least I have company   old people stick together.   <.<   Kidding aside, theres an undergrad researcher in my lab in a fraternity.  Me and my buddy were teasing him about us showing up to his next frat party, because he was trying to invite a girl from the lab next door.  Were 26 and 27.  He told us wed be the creepy old guys that scare girls away from frat parties....  We told him were old and not single, so thats the point, more drinks for us  :)  Anyway its not just a UCD thing, were down at UCLA. users/edwins ES
      Heh... Point taken.  But back in my day, we had old folks show up at our parties all the time.  Really, it was no big deal.  I wonder what has changed?  cp
       Same here.  Same question. jw

               But seriously, when I was living in the dorm, people would come to me all the time to help with their ties and a girl even asked me how to wash and dry her delicates in the laundry room. I guess I gave off some kind of homemaker vibe? My generation is a bit sheltered. Users/hankim

20110607 21:03:38 nbsp So I was pumping some iron and being my usual savage self at the gym today and realized why some girls could find a person over thirty at a bar creepy. After working in a bar for several weeks, I started recognizing some of the creepers who come every week who rarely buy a drink and basically stand around the dance floor staring at chicks in a ridiculously creepy manner. Seriously, to the point that I would tell them to GTFO if I had a loved one in the bar. Of course, the main reason I recognize them is that they are usually cheapskates and always try to avoid paying the cover. And of course, there are plenty of guys over thirty who come to the bar to enjoy a few drinks (sometimes even with their significant others) and not be creepy. And theres even this one really cool dude who is much older than the regular crowd but comes almost everyday, enjoys a few very large beers, and actually has fun on the dance floor without giving off any creepy vibe at all. But a lot of the regular older guys I tend to notice do give off a creepy vibe, at least at the bar I work. Users/hankim

20110607 22:19:16 nbsp creepy is different person by person.
and btw how do you make a wiki page? im trynna make one for jokes Users/NikhilDahal

20110607 23:20:19 nbsp Yes, I agree  very nicely done and gets to the heart of things.

It also shows that people who want to say eww, 30 year olds in a fraternity are assuming its that kind of fraternity.  Even if one buys into that kind of thinking (and you know I dont) there are a lot of different sorts of fraternities, some of which might more comfortably fit older students than others.

Moreover, he suggests restore the comments and let it be.  Finally, if the person in question is a vet, he might easily think that stop acting like degenerate imbeciles and making the military which I also served in look like a idiot factory was directed at him.  I am not defending the reaction, mind you, but I see where the demand for an apology is coming from (i.e., not from thin air, and not entirely from a misunderstanding). Users/CovertProfessor

20110609 17:29:32 nbsp Yeah, I just think that subtle distinction (talking about .44, not Randy) wont make a difference given the other comments and given that the guy is a vet. Users/CovertProfessor

20110615 12:19:44 nbsp I personally think they are useful and would not mind if they were at more gyms because I think they would be better for rows than dumbbells are (you can do much more with them, but I have not had too much experience with them, basically rows and lateral raises).

20110624 08:55:32 nbsp I agree that the DW is about D, not the DW, but since the DW is a part of D, it seems to me that it makes sense to compare one similar thing in D to another, in the same way we might compare two D restaurants to each other. Users/CovertProfessor

As to the surplus store, I would love to see it.  Back in my youth, I went to Army missile school at Redstone Arsenal, Al.  On the same reservation was the Marshall Space Flight Center.  I made friends with the guy that ran the electronics crafts shop and we would go out to the NASA salvage yard every couple of weeks for supplies.  It was really amazing.  Stuff like Hawk missiles, inertial guidance systems, Jupiter rockets, all strewn over a few acres and we could take anything we could carry away.  So yeah, I love a good surplus store.

20110705 16:19:00 nbsp Yeah, there are a lot of insandouts to the whole thing.  I think I might have a slightly better grasp of it than most, just because I used to be a regular Fo Paws customer, met Terri M back then, and saw the business change to CoFP after Charlene died.  It really did exist  it really was a business grooming dogs, first in the old Fo Paws location and then in the rockyard at the Ace. So, its all pretty clear in my head  well, all except for PAs conflicting claims.  I think I will take a shot at restoring the CoFP page and see how it goes. Users/CovertProfessor

20110706 00:50:03 nbsp I figured. Though on the flipside, I have a problem with people who dont see their pets as family members. It allows them to justify leaving them behind when moving, getting rid of them when vet bills get high, throwing them out when they get bored with them/have human children/any other random reason. One of my rabbits was left behind in a house I rented, the other was dumped in the wild and caught as a stray. I WISH those people had seen themselves as parents. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110706 09:47:02 nbsp Yeah, I know exactly what youre saying and what you mean.  I guess my posting rationale is on a part of what you just said.  No matter which way we dice the issue and whether we do or do not read what Phil Allen says, we come back to At the bare minimum a business called Craft of Fo Paws operated out of ACE Hardware, and should be on the wiki for that.
(Dont forget to toss on though, that even ignoring PAs claims, CP, a longtime editor and user of their services vouches they operated out of the FoPaws location  which in my eyes, only strengthens the argument against deleting it as nonDavis relevant).  Users/EdWins

20110706 09:55:23 nbsp I dont want to derail your convo with CP on my page, but also, I see what you mean now.

20110802 20:08:08 nbsp Im not doing this to promot my business.  These people stole a space in the Westlake Shopping center that I was looking at.  This location is in my back yard right next door to me.  It had been vacatant for years and I was planning on opening my store in that location in Octoeber.  Now because of these people Ive had to change my plans.  When I found out that they had taken that spot, I wasnt pleased to say the least.  I dont want these people in my back yard taking business away from me.  I dont want to be spending money for my business and they benefit becasue people think that Im in the shoping center when Im in the apartment complex behind the shopping center.  There is only room for one computer repair shop and it isnt theirs.  Now that they are there the leasing agent isnt likely to let me in the shopping center because they already have a computer repair shop.  This has totally ruined my plans that I had.  To really put it bluntly Im pissed off.

As far as Davis Wiki is concerned it pales in as far as the marketing materials that I have that Im going to unlease.  Ive written Davis Wiki a long time ago.  It doesnt do anythihng for me at all and Ive moved on to things that work a whole lot better for me. Users/ToddJames

20110828 17:28:36 nbsp Franks reviews are not directly related to the shop history. That is information about Frank which should be placed either in an article about Frank, or in an article about any barber shop at which Frank currently works. But not in an article specially about a new business which has replaced his own.

I agree that the history of the barber shop should be included, especially since it has been in operation for more than 50 years. However, that history should be limited to information about the barber shop and not to any specific barber or customer.

I also disagree about the length. In terms of plain text, those reviews you restored occupy more than half of the article. Is the focus of this article about the Olive Drive Barber Shop and its new owner, or is it about one of its former owners?

Back when I first read Josh Lawson referring to Bruce by the name of Art, I even thought that the account was being used by multiple people.

20110914 08:00:42 nbsp Not to bring up old news, but if Losh and Josh are doing the same type of damage, then Josh should have been banned, period. Josh made countless edits abusive of other users (including posting personal information) AND the wiki. So I guess I just think, we didnt ban someone far worse, so why crack down now?
I also dont know if Josh would particularly care that Losh is being mistaken for him. He hasnt been around for months, and honestly I dont think his reputation could get much worse anyway. Up until now, I had kind of assumed you guys knew who Losh was, and thought it was a longtime editor(s). I still think the latter is true. Maybe whoever it is will get the hint and only play the game with people who understand it. At this point I think a warning is much more appropriate. Users/MeggoWaffle

I am no advocate for how he has handled himself from time to time but fully understand the points he is trying to make. He gts upset, as we all do, that the wiki gets very cliqueish and seems to be run by a club of members who make the majority of edits and corrections as if we are the wikigods. We all feel like that from to time and when very few make the effort to contribute, especially on the level we do, we get burnt out as well. He just points in out in his own sometimes humorous, often offensive way. Hes a wellmeaning guy and longtime personal friend of mine but I agree with Meggowaffle... we never banned him and shouldn;t even consider banning another editor who has made an equal amount of positive changes as he has left negative impact such as WL.

20111003 13:26:17 nbsp I dont buy any of the magazines or videos for anything but that Rocky Horror stuff sounds like something that would have been an amazing find, in my opinion. Who doesnt like Rocky Horror???  Commies and Fascists, thats who. (yes, feeble attempt at humor upon waking). Great find though.

I have a lot of friends in the industry, not sure how that happened over the years, but it did. I absolutely hate pornography but love the artistic side of erotica. One of my friends stated it best The art of erotica, for me, allows a woman to be sensual without debasing her or depowering her. Rather it gives her the sense of strength intertwined with her beauty and empowers her.

Pornography does the exact opposite in her mind and in mine as well.

To give an example of a few of my friends works, I will include some Deviant Art Links to them. There are other links but they share these works in a more public forum and have no problem with any of them being shared. Might not want to open these in the workplace, would be frowned upon I would wager.

http://laesmeralda.deviantart.com/ Esmeralda Gothic, moody, corsetry work.
http://sandymanase.deviantart.com/gallery/ Cassandra  Light and shadow play.
http://ladymorgana.deviantart.com/ Morgan  Color play, corsetry and latex.
http://decogoddess.deviantart.com/ Audrey  Artistic Nude, Artdeco (really good friend of mine who doesnt live to far away)

There are tons more, but specific examples of the types of imagery or artistic expression I would select (that classify as erotica for most, though not to me) would be things like these:

http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d3l1jeo Anerades A great underwater shoot by my friend Nikos Vasilakis. Great photographer of nudes and other types of erotica but his sense of motion and emotion are captivating.
http://gesell.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4azom9 Surreal Playlist by Stefan Gesell. This is one of my friends that tends to go to the darkest corners and the oddest settings/poses but his color work, as in this piece, are absolutely amazing and his sense of perspective can be insanely brilliant, as in this image.

Anyway, not sure if I helped or hurt the argument, but thats my take on the Porn v Erotica debate. Users/WesP

20111003 19:16:32 nbsp I think that might very well be the underlying difficulty in finding the title for the page, among other details: The stigma associated with the term pornography. It is very similar to your example of burlesque vs stripclub... There is an artistic value accepted by society as a whole for the burlesque (erotica) style shows whereas there is this accepted sense of obscenity or wrongdoing associated with pornography. It all brings me to an older thought process I had about how commonly accepted violence is in films and television, even profanity nowadays, whereas any type of nudity or sensuality automatically earns a much more guarded rating. This countries aversion to coping with the reality of sensuality is, in my opinion, the leading cause to the majority of the sex crimes and perversion out there today. It is the repression of human nature that causes insecurity and, too often, a lashing out against societal norms.  Users/WesP

20111014 16:25:45 nbsp I think there are some similarities between the Tea Party and OWS  they are both pissed at both parties, and both unhappy with some aspects of the stimulus packages that were passed.  However, I think whereas the Tea Party was unhappy with all of the stimulus, OWS is focusing on the bailouts to corporations and in particular the fact that no accountability was attached to the money and no prosecutions occurring now.  I havent heard OWS protesters complaining about the parts of the stimulus that were for infrastructure and job creation.  Also, the focus of the Tea Party seems to be more on smaller government, fewer taxes, and getting rid of XRomneyXObamacare.  OWS, on the other hand, is more focused on getting the corporations out of the political process and to do something about job creation and student loan debt.  They also, I believe, want to increase taxes on the wealthy, which again, is contra Tea Party ideals.  So, I see big differences between the messages of the two movements. Users/CovertProfessor

20111014 18:12:04 nbsp There was an address given to a version without the music:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?vgIcqb9hHQ3E.  Much easier to listen to!

I agree that most of that would be agreed to by both TP and OWS, but that is because most of it is so general  e.g., both sides agree that there are problems with health care and taxes, but I think the changes they want are very different.  As for what he proposed at the end, I am not sure that TPs would want that, because it involves government getting involved, and they say they want less government involvement.

20111106 12:20:02 nbsp The lifting of the absinthe ban of 2007 only allows absinthe that contains no thujone (the notorious chemical found in wormwood) in the finished project, meaning that a ban on absinthe that actually contains more than trace amounts of wormwood is still banned in the US. Many absinthe brands are still destroyed by customs if discovered. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111106 12:31:08 nbsp Well, thats not what it says in the Wikipedia article on absinthe. Granted, Wikipedia content doesnt always draw from the best sources, but the article describes strict thujone limitations which I have no reason to believe are inaccurate. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111106 12:57:45 nbsp  According to the thujone entry you told me to read, Absinthe offered for sale in the United States must be thujonefree, which is interpreted as containing less than 10 mg/kg . In other words, only a trace amount. Im pretty sure most traditional absinthe had more thujone than 10mg/kg , but I am open to credible sources that say otherwise. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111106 13:33:35 nbsp Yeah, but the sentence right before the one you quoted mentioned another study that tested more than just three brands. A 2008 study of 13 preban (1895–1910) bottles using gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) found that the bottles had between 0.5 mg/L and 48.3 mg/L and averaged 25.4 mg/L. Anyhoo, basically there seems to have been a wide variance of thujons in the traditional recipes.  But you still might be right about 10 mg/kg being high for traditional absinthe if the earlier 2005 study truly represented high wormwood recipes as the entry claims. 48.3 mg/L bottles and so forth could just be freaky outliers as opposed to standard offerings, but Id have to look at the individual studies to find out more. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111106 15:00:37 nbsp I tried to find some sort of official government source that states what true thujonelimitation is if ever it truly does exist.. But Im not having a lot of luck. And some of it seems pretty contradictory, such as a Time piece from 2007, written soon after the ban was lifted. That article claims that absinthe must be thujonefree in the US, but it gives a 10 parts per million rule, and I have no idea how that compares but it sounds more strict than the 10 mg/kg rule to my nonmathematic brain..  I cant find a lot of other information, but I hope its not as tightly regulated as it sounds because I get sick of this nannygovernment BS sometimes! Especially since, as you say, its not like thujone has been scientifically shown to be damaging in small amounts.

I just sipped some of this Absente. It tastes kind of like black licorice I think. Its not too bad, but I probably should have done the sugar/water thing. You must have tried absinthe as well, I take it? Users/ScottMeehleib

20111125 15:29:51 nbsp Definitely Occupy Davis and Occupy UC Davis are different.  My thoughts about them have changed.  One thought I had was that Occupy Davis would include Occupy Davis (City of Davis) and Occupy UC Davis, similar to Davis including City of Davis and UC Davis.  Now a more accurate portrayal might be that there are Davis Occupies (Davis Occupys).  Separate societies are springing up in the different Occupies.  Some Davis Occupyers joined the UC Davis Occupy with the tents which were objectionable to the UCD Administration in the day or so before the pepperspraying.  Because of the issue of having UCD affiliated people on the campus, there is a kind of boundary for Occupy UC Davis.  The Occupy Davis people see themselves as different than Occupy UC Davis.  I talked to a UCD coed sophomore who was visiting Occupy Davis.  She identifies with Occupy Sacramento (that she thinks should move to 16th/P Streets), because Occupy UC Davis is just addressing the tuition issue rather than other Occupy issues like banking.  There is a shared identity among the different Occupyers.  On a related topic to your question, I wonder what boundary there is between UC Davis Occupyers and all the students concerned with student issues.  Also I dont know if the UC Davis Occupyers have a different name for themselves than Occupy UC Davis.     Users/BruceHansen
  I didnt know if you were serious about this not making any sense. but I saw that there was lack of clarity.  Is this better?  On another topic, Ive found out that there are some serious divisions among the students.  Longtime friendships have suffered with divisions over Occupy UC Davis issues. Users/BruceHansen

20111201 09:54:45 nbsp Have you actually heard anyone use that term, though?  It seems enough to say that some people feel that the movement is made up of mostly white people and white concerns, and by failing to take into account the particular issues that people of color are facing, it is racist.  An Occupy UC Davis example would be the person who pointed out at the Nov. 21 rally that people of color have been facing violent treatment from the police for a long time, but when white folks get sprayed, people pay attention.  Its not a big deal, but the word just strikes an odd note for me.  I do understand that it strikes an odd note for you as well, and that youre just trying to represent what others think.

20111207 21:28:58 nbsp The Supreme Court basically ruled that contracts can be written in this manner and companies can no longer be sued by customers. This is what the Occupy Movement is all about. It about the Supreme Court giving power to companies and denying customers the right to sue even if the company does something horrific to the customer. Big corporations obviously bribed the Supreme Court and this is dangerous because losing the right to sue could also be applied to employment contracts. Users/MaxLucas

20111208 08:09:23 nbsp Actually, arbitration clauses are pretty effective, although it varies by jurisdiction.  Under the Federal Arbitration Act there are very few circumstances where an arbitration clause in a contract for an interstate transaction isnt enforceable.  Where a transaction doesnt cross state lines, the commerce clause doesnt give the federal government jurisdiction, meaning that the relevant state law applies.  In California, I think the rule is that the court in which a lawsuit is filed is supposed to determine whether arbitration would be likely to create a result contrary to other recent, similar cases handled in the courts.  Its a messy system. Users/TomGarberson

20120119 08:15:06 nbsp Thanks! Just reposted. Users/NicholasBarry

20120119 14:33:37 nbsp The way the Big Book of AA is written and the way the official organization persists and is experienced (at least by me), Id say its very much Abrahamic in its foundation and with much to do about submitting (like Islam) and feeling guilty (moral inventories and listing everybody youve wronged). I dont believe AA is perfect by any means, and I certainly support splinter sects that seek to make certain groups more comfortable.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20120119 15:33:25 nbsp By the way, if youd like to change the word from submission to something else, Id probably be okay with that. I was shooting from the hip with that based on personal experience, but Id welcome any alternative. Im happy with AA in the sense that I feel like it works. However, I have criticisms and biases like any other person though that tend to creep out. The system works for me but it has a very antiquated style that a lot of people seem reluctant to mess with. Personally, as a Buddhist, it was kind of a hard issue even deciding if the system was even compatible with my beliefs to begin with. Talk of higher powers and gods doesnt resonate well with a system that rejects all absolutes. In the end, I decided that the Middle Way and just plain objective reasonableness would be my higher power. But again, this doesnt quite mesh well with the Big Book as it stands in terms of technical terminology. On the positive side, the Davis groups have always been very tolerant and Ive never felt judged or ostracized for my beliefs. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120120 11:34:08 nbsp I just noticed the bit where you called my description of AA disingenuous. That is an unfair characterization. I had the best of intentions in that writeup, and I am a supporter and member of AA. I agree that it appears as though the entry is slanted towards the religious elements, but thats only because thats where my primary interest lies. I guess its fair to say that I am a deeply religious person, and so that was my initial attraction to the group. The biases and criticisms that I have were not intended to undermine an organization I greatly respect and admire. They do however reflect my experiences, and with time, I would hope that other people would share the secular parts that are of interest to them. AA remains a primarily religious organization, however, and people deserve to know that. Otherwise they will be confused when they attend their first meetings and are offered not only the Big Book but another book called Came to Believe which has chapters titled The Spirit Touch and another dealing with spiritual synchronicity. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120120 14:44:02 nbsp Feel free to make whatever changes you want to the AA entry. I dont like the term splinter sects either, but I couldnt think of anything better. There is, after all, an official AA organization and everything that changes the formula is technically splintering off from the norm. Having said that, I was simply trying to make an informational entry. Delete or revise anything that you feel is detrimental. Personally, I have very little respect for the 11th tradition as it stands in regards to my own personal participation in AA. Like a lot of AA, its outdated IMO. My name is not explicitly plastered to any of my edits anyway, and is only visible to the most devoted wikians who dig into recent changes. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120210 04:06:19 nbsp Hi there, I understand keeping the comment about the Dr jack Lin DDS is try to protect Davis community. However, Down south in Australia, we have two dental specialist who share the same name as the bad one in Davis. Our specialist service is base on the referral. However, before our patients contact our office make the appointment wait for 23 months and travel few hundred kilometer, they always search about the specialist they are about to see on google. Unfortunately , that wiki comments came on top of search list. Most of my patient does not realise they are reading a comment across the pacific ocean. One of the patient decided to travel further 5 hours away to see my other colleague,  instead seeking a treatment locally. However, she endup with severe infection and hospitalized for few days. I did not notice about this web page until my colleague call me in person.

All I want is to protect my patient and local community as you do in Davis. Is that any way you can help me to resolve this issue. Regards, Dr Jack C. Lin (Endodontist) Users/JackLin

20120218 15:15:03 nbsp Hmm, maybe I didnt express myself very well.  What I was trying to say was this: The pepper spray incident and related judgments of blame are very valueladen.  So, it is not possible to come to purely factbased objective conclusions.  Some would go further and say that because values are involved, no objective conclusions can be drawn at all.  However, I dont believe that; I believe that its possible to have an objective discussion of values  I just dont think the wiki is a good place for doing that.  So, the best we can do is represent the range of values and opinions in the Davis community.  I think we agree on that last point.

If people need bags, they can buy the appropriate bag for the purpose, e.g., we buy cornbased biodegradable poop bags that are sized for the purpose.  The main point I was trying to make was that people like XmeX Bob Dunning say that everyone uses the bags again and then recycles them.  I dont think thats true, and the fact that there were so many blowing around is evidence that people arent reusing/recycling.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120501 15:59:01 nbsp Yeah, it can be a bit disheartening that some business are so stubborn or uncaring. The way I understand it, there is no general inspection mechanism for enforcing the ADA, unlike health inspections and general building codes inspections. Some of the owners Ive encountered have been very dismissive because they apparently did a bit of research and honestly believe that they are ADA compliant.

20120510 18:25:08 nbsp Hey, JW (Im posting the same on CovertProfessors page). I just reviewed my intern’s recent edits, and saw your comments. I’ve spoken to him directly about his poor judgment in choosing a username.

While acknowledging that the username was inappropriate and mean, I hope that actions speak louder than words. I’m personally a huge supporter of Daviswiki – hell, I contributed $100 to the Localwiki campaign – and I’ve made it a point to put a lot of our info on Daviswiki, even when it doesn’t benefit our organization. A lot of organizations wouldn’t even bother to create a list of places you could use their product – they’d just have that on their website. And the easy thing for us to do would just be to make a plain text list on our page, but we’ve created about 15 of the businesses’ pages, and intend to create more. Sure, 15 is a small number, and it’s not as if we did a lot of journalism on those pages. I’m not trying to claim any medals. But I hope it shows a lot more commitment to the wiki than most businesses or individuals would make.

Also, may I note that one of our other interns used the username “davisrox”? That’s positive, right? (I’m being lighthearted, in case you can’t read the tone ). By the way, I’ve created instructions for all future team members to use their actual names.

I can’t read your tone, by the way – I’m not sure how serious you are when you’re talking about this username creating an impression about the entire organization. I understand that the people who represent an organization inevitably contribute to the organization’s perception, but as I said, I hope you can look past the words to the actions.

And if there are other things that I’ve missed that you think are problematic, or if things come up in the future…you know that you could always drop me a line? A quick “Hey, your intern’s username is kind of jerky” would be fine. One of the things I really like about the wiki is how much editors engage each other in conversation. One of the things that makes that username mean is that it’s an anonymous, unproductive criticism of Daviswiki, without trying to engage in any meaningful conversation. I’m trying to represent the opposite by engaging, with this post, and if you do the same and drop me a line in the future, it will make it easier for me to remedy anything that comes up.

Theyre a crazy species. According to the internet they go from mating to being tadpoles in 721 days and then are full fledged frogs 23 months later. What else is wild is that they apparently have both a homing and timing instinct in that they return to their place of birth to mate and somehow they have an idea on when theyll be water there. We hadnt see a frog in the whole year weve been living here and then in the three days prior to when they filled the canal our cats caught (and we released) two of them. Users/MikeyCrews

  Agreed.  Having been there, Ive seen no evidence of either.   Users/CovertProfessor
     I had already changed Bibas to a comparison.  Is around $50 a person an expected price point?  I altered it to be a useful metric.  Remember, this is not a court: hearsay is acceptable, with the source being taken into account.  Its not like theres ever a final ruling, so things can always be altered with a simple, I dont think this is true, here let me change it, preferably with a comment explaining why, so it is clear to bystanders what the reasoning is.  Different severity of outcome, so a different threshold of proofFootnote(The one time theres a severity of outcome that demands serious evidence and/or careful wording are the socalled nuclear accusations: racism, sexual assault, etc.  The wiki wrestles with this, because this has been a forum by which accusers have found strength in each other, coming forward.  Other times, it appeared that there were spurious claims.   I myself put up such an accusation recently, based on what I had heard in a broadcast medium, looking for proof, but dated to make sure it is removed if proof fails to surface.).   Plus much of the trivial history of Davis is locked up in hearsay, so it is important for things like, John left Northern California to pursue a relationship, thus selling his business.   I know this, as I heard from him a little about his dates over a few months, and he later vocally told people he was moving for that reason, and was looking for a buyer.  But theres probably no absolute proof.     jw
      Seems to me that the menu prices speak for themselves  it depends on what you order.  If you order pasta for your main dish and nothing else, youre not going to be spending $50.  I dont see the point of speculating about what the average diner will spend.    cp
         They used to word their menu as having first courses and second courses. In my opinion, this sort of pressured the customer into thinking they werent getting a complete meal without both. With some wine, and dessert or appetizers, Im sure $100 per person was not uncommon and maybe even a lowball estimate. This restaurant, particularly in its early days, was clearly aimed for splurgers: the wealth Davis elite and others who are out to impress people for a special occasion. SM
           Primi and secondi are standard terms for Italian restaurant menus, and authentic Italian cooking doesnt have pasta as a main dish.  Thats not an attempt to pressure; thats the way the cuisine is, which of course, one can freely ignore by ordering what one wants. And of course, yes, people can spend $100 easily there if they like.  Or not, if they dont like.  I just object to the suggestion that if you go there that that will inevitably be your bill.  cp
             Im not very familiar with Italian restaurants beyond the Americanized ones. All i know is that as an average joe, if i were to go to any restaurant that offers multiple courses, I would assume that even the main entrees would be significantly smaller than other restaurants that dont offer courses. Are the portions smaller here than the average Davis restaurant or about on par? I would say that would be a good determinant as to an estimate of how much people typically pay, as most diners like to get full. SM
               The portion sizes are typical for upscale Italian restaurants, in my experience.  Of course, they dont rival those of, say, Black Bear Diner, which will offer you insane amounts of mediocre food.     cp

20120830 15:08:39 nbsp Sorry about Panera. I purely misread the #s. Users/PeteB

20121005 14:34:33 nbsp FYI Im despamifying any email addresses I see. Im hearing reports that email addresses are being lifted specifically off Wikis Users/PeteB

20121006 13:05:07 nbsp Is there a way to make a macro that takes a parameter, so eg I could create a link to the actual page on the woodland wiki with the Davis to Woodland macro? Users/ScottRitchie

20121018 23:53:48 nbsp Done, I made a starting entry for Instagram. I think its relevant to Davis. You have many people taking photos with smartphone and Instagram allows easy photo sharing to reach broad audience. Users/SimonFung

20121027 13:43:32 nbsp Yep.  And I think some people worked pretty hard to find some compromises on this one. Users/CovertProfessor

20121031 19:49:09 nbsp Informative and entertaining edit comments make me happy. I strive to make the mundane a bit more interesting :) Users/LoriOrf

20121105 18:09:28 nbsp Jabsneed you to stop Users/Tom12hes in active whitewash mode Users/PeteB

20121106 11:10:28 nbsp I see your point about moving the Politics section down on the ACE page, but given the timeliness (i.e., election day) plus the attention that the page has received from the Vanguard and Patch, I would think it would make more sense to keep it higher on the page for now and then move it back down later. Users/CovertProfessor

20121106 13:32:46 nbsp Thanks.  I too was torn about where to put it at first. Users/CovertProfessor

20121112 20:29:09 nbsp FYI unnecessary legal threat on 24/7 Taxi Cab Company. Doubt he can do anything but I thought you should be aware. Users/PeteB

20121114 12:21:51 nbsp Jabberwokky please act on my proposal in 24/7 Taxi Cab Company/Talktheres a pretty clear community consensus. AndrewNodim is continuing to insult people. Please end this matter Users/PeteB

20121114 12:47:19 nbsp JabsFYI I posted that to Andrew already. He ignored it, wiped out the talk page and posted another insult. Users/PeteB

20121114 13:04:04 nbsp I wouldve retracted the proposal if Tom had messaged me...(shrug) Users/PeteB

20121119 14:25:35 nbsp Hi, I added a note to the Uncle Vitos page about how they no longer serve burgers.... I wasnt sure if that was proper protocol or not? I left a comment, too.  Users/HannahToru

20121120 11:27:35 nbsp one of her kids was my age and went to DJUSD with me. 1 degree of Davis. Its always been a doozy of a last name and I figured I would share Users/StevenDaubert

20121120 18:14:07 nbsp FYI I believe Users/StevenJonson is the same person as Users/stevejonson. Users/PeteB

20121121 23:08:53 nbsp Sure, glad to.  CO really did start an important conversation.  Its too bad that she doesnt seem to want to genuinely engage in it. Users/CovertProfessor

20121122 02:04:15 nbsp The heading, Why eat Balanced? could be seen as viewing every other other way of eating as imbalanced. I understand that each section is going to be biased, but if the heading itself doesnt reflect specifics (in this case eating meat), it could come across like this is the sane way until you even read the text below. I dont think that was your intent (Im guessing you changed it since Counterpoint: Meat isnt appropriate because it should be presenting itself as a unique ethical system rather than a counterpoint) , but it just seems like the heading should definitely directly refer to meat, IMHO. Users/ScottMeehleib

20121122 02:08:32 nbsp Happy thanksgiving btw! Users/ScottMeehleib

20121122 11:55:04 nbsp How are GMOs simple and selfsustaining?  Im not quite getting it. Users/CovertProfessor

20121122 14:30:43 nbsp !!!! scared the  out of me Users/StevenDaubert

20121122 23:04:38 nbsp Ah, ok, I suppose I can see how GMOs might help them be selfsustaining, at least in the short term (but boy, the tone of that article is obnoxious).  Simple, though  no.  And I think GMOs are far less tested than big biotech lets on.  But thats another story.

As for the ethical eating page  some people do seem to think that theyve eliminated all possible ethical concerns by eating animals that were humanely raised and killed.  So, I think its important to state explicitly that that isnt the case. Users/CovertProfessor

20121123 09:27:58 nbsp Jabs regarding BKCAB AIRPORT ONLY they have two entirely different phone #s. Users/PeteB

20121123 18:51:53 nbsp You were going to elaborate about Bk Cab Airport Only?? Users/PeteB

20121123 19:14:28 nbsp Hope you and Sarah are feeling better soon. Users/CovertProfessor

20121123 19:34:49 nbsp Im sorry Jabsdidnt know you were sick. Both of you feel better soon! Users/PeteB

20121123 19:44:57 nbsp Thank you for the distance comparison. I dont think they should be allowed on here. Users/PeteB

20121126 22:04:17 nbsp Sorry, I hope you dont mind that I moved your edit about Sunset Magazine to its own page.  I did try to do due diligence and link it into the wiki.  Its just that when I saw Mikeys latest photo on the Sunset page, I thought to myself, This is one of the best pages of the wiki.  A page that highlights the beauty of Davis.  Not commercial.  Not there for any reason other than enjoyment.  So, perhaps you can understand why I moved the magazine reference off, though I think I do understand why you put it there. Users/CovertProfessor

20121204 12:16:40 nbsp Thanks for the California Burrito info. I was assuming that by putting avocado on anything you could call it California and that the potatoes being there were just a coincidence, but there does appear to be a consensus on what a California Burrito is and that it came from SD.  Users/MikeyCrews

20121211 12:56:52 nbsp Ah, for the good ol days.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20121211 20:52:15 nbsp Oh good, Im glad you like it.  I actually took some more traditional puddle photos, but then my partner jokingly said, Use the Toad Hollow one, and I thought, Why not?  Its just a very large perpetual puddle.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20121212 16:29:23 nbsp Thanks for the help! Users/JaredCrisologoSmith
