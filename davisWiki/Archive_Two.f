Yes, it is pathetically true  I managed to exceed the wiki limits with my archive and page and it is now split into pieces.  These are the older comments.


20101027 12:50:46 nbsp Im probably jumping the gun in asking this, but whats with the Wednesday, October 27, 2010 linkies up there? Users/TomGarberson

20101027 13:00:05 nbsp Haha gotcha... when you put it that way, I agree, its a hilarious visual. Users/TomGarberson

20101028 09:26:07 nbsp Haha very fair guess... but that one wasnt me. Users/TomGarberson

20101028 11:15:58 nbsp I dont know her, it just looked at first glance like someone was removing information for no particularly good reason (obviously that wasnt the case). She does appear to have her contact info on the facebook page, which is linked, but Im trying to stick to a policy of only one revert per page per incident, so Ill leave it up to others to decide if theres some form of that sentence that they feel is appropriate. Users/JoePomidor

20101030 15:49:18 nbsp Thanks for catching the tag on the allegre page.  I just remembered that it was still there. Users/TomGarberson

20101030 22:10:12 nbsp Yes! Thanks.  Users/DonShor

20101103 12:28:43 nbsp I will concur with Fruit/Veg/Talk paragraph deletion as opening up; I just wish the higherups might allow more than 1/2 hour per week for the wikiside of things.  Theres been significant communitythinking about it over the past week and the limited response was disappointing. Users/JudithTruman

20101103 12:50:37 nbsp Wok hay, in kitchen vocabulary, is the breath of the wok, the additional smokey flavor you get when the wok is HOT and the steam from the moist foods is able to evaporate readily, so it is cooked as stirFRY rather than stirsimmer.  In science terms, its probably hydrocarbon vaporization the cooking oils and fats are at their smoke pointplus carbohydrate charring.  For chow fun, it can make the difference between stucktogether noodles and seasoned separated noodles.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_noodles and http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/531342 reveal that chow refers to frying, and ho fun are the wide flat rice noodles.

20101105 10:39:11 nbsp It is time for William Lewis to be banned from Davis Wiki.  Users/DonShor

20101105 20:19:49 nbsp Thanks for fixing up the AggieTV page for me, it looks great! And I added that it does receive funds. Users/SaherR

20101105 21:36:56 nbsp How are you and Sarah liking Nashville by now?  I only spent a weekend there, and most of that was academically oriented, but it seemed like a really amazing city. Users/TomGarberson

20101109 14:15:13 nbsp Right, thats why I dont want my reply to Adobe Management to be moved to the talk page. The talks seem much less relevant. Han has already agreed to that. I have not agreed to deleting my reply to Adobe Management though. Users/anonpincher

20101109 14:16:46 nbsp PLEASE ban Users/anonpincher and end this misery. Users/PeterBoulay

20101109 14:30:20 nbsp Sorry to upset you JW....anon has been allowed to go to far and someone had to stand up for the multiple people who agree with my opinion. You basically did exactly what I wanted to happen. Thanks Users/PeterBoulay

20101109 14:36:42 nbsp Alright, sounds good Jabber. Seems like Peter is happy, which is odd since the material he was squabbling over is still there. But hey its good to see hes happy now.  Users/anonpincher
    Dont speak for me, Anon....its lockedI have no choice. pb
    You just said that Jabber did exactly what you wanted to happen. Are you saying youre unhappy now with something? ap

20101109 15:09:42 nbsp I dont follow man. Whatever it was, it certainly wasnt on purpose. Its probably because I lack the Wiki know how...I think Tom may have tried to tell me how to do a better job of that, and I havent gotten around to reading it fully, but its not like Im doing that to hide anything.  Users/anonpincher


20101109 16:58:47 nbsp Yea I just dont agree that it would appeal to more people necessarily. It would satisfy detractors, but we dont know who these detractors are, or what their interests are, so who are we really satisfying? Users/anonpincher
 What do you mean by we dont know who these detractors are?  Every single person who has chimed in on the issue has agreed that the comment holds virtually no value asis.  The only disagreement is whether thats reason to remove it.  We know that the detractors who think details would give your comment value include myself, Peter Boulay, Joe Pomidor, William Lewis, Kemble Pope, Brett Hall, and Covert Professor (maybe others, not going to look carefully).  Of those, Covert Professor is the only one whose actual identity we dont know, and (s)he has done a lot to establish identity here. Users/TomGarberson

20101109 17:14:30 nbsp Thats fine, but really, its hard to collaboratively edit my opinion if it means diluting it in order to satisfy certain parties. I mean basically you get one faction that says get rid of the dang thing, and are only finding ways to get rid of it entirely. If you want to focus on adding one or two things under my comments to support or detract from the comment then thats fine. As Covertprofessor has stated, I undermine my own credibility by not wanting to change the language if its as terrible as these collaborators say. The comment would simply be passed over if it wasnt helpful. Whats happening here is akin to trying to shut the entire comment down dismissing it completely, trying to control me. I just dont agree. I dont know what you want me to add, but just add it all underneath if need be. I dont think the talks have been very helpful at all except to try and interpret the comments section and what it should have based on their own beliefs.  Users/anonpincher

20101109 17:47:30 nbsp I have included specifics, but not necessarily detailed. Intense detail is not necessary since I dont want this to turn into a lets find out who he is journey.  Users/anonpincher

20101109 18:12:07 nbsp Yea I basically cited things that I know theyve done to so many other people including to me. I didnt want to list any problem that was only specific to me. Its truly an understated negative review.  Users/anonpincher

20101109 21:26:29 nbsp no worries, im just concerned that my valid point got lost in all of that crazy talk. Users/KemblePope

20101110 09:22:04 nbsp No worries!  Ill probably take another stab at it today.  I actually didnt know it was an official form of math though.  Oh well!  Thank god I taught myself the right way to do it the first time I guess.  Haha! Users/RickJames

20101110 09:24:01 nbsp By the way, I like the direction its going so far! Users/RickJames

20101110 22:19:49 nbsp What about a page for change of ownership?  Its not a new business that would be listed, but one with new ownership. For example consider the car wash at 5/L Streets.  It didnt used to have a name. It sold, was remodeled.  Assuming that it still doesnt have a name (Maybe it does.) and was just remodeled.  It could be listed as having new ownership;  maybe be listed as being remodeled. Users/BruceHansen

20101119 10:46:14 nbsp Please see Current Businesses  Discussion.  Thanks. Users/BruceHansen

20101120 15:01:00 nbsp Christianity is a religion, not a family of religions. Furthermore, IDNEs representation of different Christian sects not thinking that other Christian sects are Christian is misleading. Its a small phenomena confined to a handful of groups. Please do not restore any version that makes these errors. Users/WilliamLewis

20101122 02:11:15 nbsp RE: Your recent comment Its not something I feel strongly about, but if you look at the edit pages you see one name... so it just felt that a sort of disclaimer was warranted in that case so as not to mislead any readers. But again, on the scale of things its not something worth fussing over so I put in my 2 cents, and Im done with that issue. Users/SteveDavison

20101128 18:22:14 nbsp Please I dont know what this one entry means to you, but it means a lot for my friend who is daughter of the deceased. And she would prefer for the links not to be there. This wiki back and forth is really not interesting for me; but Im helping a friend who would like a little control over the misinformation that was written about her father. Let her have this for her piece of mind. Users/GeorgiaMiner

20101202 13:20:44 nbsp Thank you JW...you might want to consider banning AP as hes now going to btch that his comments have been removed and cause an edit war there PeteB Users/PeterBoulay

20101202 13:34:25 nbsp Hyperaggressive? Nice insult JW...cmon. You have someone who consistently picks fights with people and reverts others edits without any care to what anyone says. People repeatedly and I mean repeatedly try to work with him to no avail. Surekeep him onits clearly obvious to me (and others) hes not going to try to work with anyone here reasonably.  Users/PeterBoulay

20101202 14:05:47 nbsp I dont think that its nitpicking.  On many occasions, ap has said, Dont get on their bad side or they will kill you. Users/KemblePope

20101202 23:20:08 nbsp I just wanted to let you know that I think you are an awesome dude. Fair and gracious. King of Davis in exile as far as I see it. :) Users/ScottMeehleib

20101206 10:05:13 nbsp Thanks and sorry for not renaming the right page at that time. Users/BruceHansen

20101207 17:15:20 nbsp Heh... yes, I thought it might be an edit clobber, but I wasnt sure.  Glad you like the sic.   Users/CovertProfessor

20101207 17:25:26 nbsp I am glad to hear that.  Thanks for so often being willing to be the one who smooths things over.   Users/CovertProfessor

20101207 17:30:58 nbsp Yep, good point.  Much better to find someone to work with than to go the locking route, which is a best an imperfect solution, at worst no solution at all. Users/CovertProfessor

20101208 08:30:09 nbsp is the wiki on fire?!?
... or its wiki birthday. How many years now? (I dont know where the info is) Users/ChristyMarsden

20101208 09:09:44 nbsp Do you want Webmaster to stand as a username?  I wouldnt think that would be a good idea. Users/CovertProfessor

20101208 12:56:02 nbsp Ah, ok  that makes sense. I was also thinking of listing it under Wiki Community/Organizational accounts/List, but perhaps that doesnt make sense if its a one shot deal. Users/CovertProfessor

20101208 14:07:23 nbsp ... I feel so ridiculous right now, haha! OF COURSE the wiki isnt on fire. How ignorant of me :(

Thanks for the info :D Users/ChristyMarsden

20101208 14:21:10 nbsp I was actually planning to revert the resizing and link the version so people could look at it and decide.  Feel free to do so, or go ahead and bump the B&B icon on down like you had it.  Sorry about the crossediting Users/TomGarberson

20101210 17:22:35 nbsp Hey, just saying thanks for the outstanding intro to the community! Users/danielchoi

20101211 00:05:56 nbsp Your wish is my command, sir!  (Seems like I owe you a few). Users/CovertProfessor

20101211 09:46:14 nbsp Oh, I agree completely.  Not only was it something you asked for, it was also the right thing to do.  I wouldnt have done it otherwise.   Users/CovertProfessor

20101211 13:17:21 nbsp Very nice!  I like them all. Users/TomGarberson

20101213 10:20:50 nbsp Thanks, JW.  Regarding the word services following the name of businesses, that wouldnt apply, would it, where the business is selling supplies, so wouldnt the services category fall under, for example. B2B?  The services phrase could redirect to the word or words without the service. Users/BruceHansen

20101215 15:56:54 nbsp Haha thats a great idea! I bet we would get a lot of love from the http://www.youtube.com/watch?vP_i1xk07o4g Vampire Weekend crowd. Users/JoePomidor

20101218 13:25:54 nbsp JWI really think Elizabeths Pet Sitting needs to be reworked. Its obvious shes gone beyond the justhavingapageonthewiki. She really is using it specifically for advertising and all the pics are outofhand IMHO. Users/PeterBoulay
    That was already done on the 13th....Elizabeths Pet Sitting/Talk PeteB
    Going to you because you had a lot of say on Lucis issues...and to me the graphical content on Elizabeth way outdoes Lucis. PeteB

20101219 13:09:25 nbsp I went over to Pet Sitters International and clicked find a petsitter in your areaits on the top bar on the page on the right hand side.  Searching for 95616 got half a dozen hits for petsitters in Davis/El Macero, most of whom are on the Wiki.  I couldnt find Elizabeth in this way.  Her claim may be valid, and I may have been too hasty there.  Reading through petsitter wiki pages vs their own websites, I was struck by the tendency for Wiki to be selfwritten and sparse with a CONTACT ME!! flavor, where their homepages are rich and chatty and full of infowith linkbacks to Pet Sitters International, yes, but the overall tone is here is everything about me and oh yeah, PSI rather than heres my degree! and PSI! which in contrast seems forcefully bona fideswaving.  As long as theres a group effort happening on one petsitting page, pushing some of the others up the recent changes list makes it seem like were updating the category rather than attacking one. Users/JudithTruman

20101220 22:33:07 nbsp Theres a youre instead of your on the locked real estate page.... Users/Angel.York

20101221 20:31:23 nbsp Has anyone mentioned how abhorable the new line setup between comments seems to appear... love ya man, but your page is a prime example of how distracting and convoluted the new line appearance makes a page seem. Users/WesP

20101222 13:24:09 nbsp Im not seeing anything different, but for some reason I never see any notices that I have a new message, not even that little one that used to pop up next to my username at the top of the page. I do have an adblocker running (adblock plus in firefox), so that may be why it doesnt show. Users/JoePomidor

20101222 19:39:04 nbsp Perhaps it is just a difference between the Firefox appearance (which I used previously) and the Internet Explorer (which I am currently using after upgrading my system)   I will have to check out Firefox to see if this is the case.  My Main beef is with the Messages though.. the bar takes up over half of the DavisWiki title bar and does redirect (at least it redirects me) to the wikispot and then has a link saying You can find WesP on DavisWiki. which redirects back to our local wiki... its annoying as heck. Users/WesP

20101223 08:26:12 nbsp Can you leave a comment on my page?  I havent actually seen the new markup in action yet. Users/CovertProfessor

20101224 16:23:42 nbsp Merry Christmas Users/WesP

20101226 20:05:19 nbsp Im perplexed with your comment to me.  To clarify, perhaps, there are 3 links:  user name, settings and logout.  The over link banner has only a link to the messages page, right? Users/BruceHansen

20101226 21:03:15 nbsp In summary, were agreed.  To explain, firstly, because I didnt look closely enough when I clicked on the occasional Messages banner to make an appearance, I referred to it as a messages page instead of the InterWiki Links page.  I was narrowly focused on getting to my message.  Secondly, Ill take your word that the previous messages link was the same. (Just offhand I dont know how to check it out now.)  Early on I started clicking on my user link.  Speaking of InterWiki Links, where are the Wiki Leaks? Users/BruceHansen

20101226 23:04:53 nbsp Guess it is the same. If you look at my comments in the Talk section you can see my posts.  I have always just clicked my name when I had new messages, hence a bit of the confusion. The overpowering top bar, however has to go. I wouldnt mind a different message alert, just not a bar that literally takes up the entire top portion of the Wiki (as can be seen in the images I posted).  I appreciate the hard work you are putting into this though. If I could do it, I would help, but I am a programming noob. sigh Users/WesP

20101226 23:10:05 nbsp Again, glad to help.  I must admit that I was stubbornly holding onto the view that the link had changed (how, I didnt know) until you posted that FAQ item from 2008.  Nothing like incontrovertible evidence to make one change ones mind.  :)  So, once I knew that the link hadnt changed, I was forced to come up with an alternative explanation because I was pretty darn sure that I hadnt clicking through to my interwiki bookmarks!  And then when I saw the location of the old flag on wikispot, it clicked.   Users/CovertProfessor

20101230 15:51:02 nbsp Sure, glad to help.  And thank you for coming up with a way that we can handle other lawyers pages.  I like it.  I also finally took a look at that PDF, and I am convinced more than ever that something should be on the page.  Unless that lawyer fell into a hole or a coma for two months, there seems to be no excuse for what happened. Users/CovertProfessor
  I have a feeling this PDF image will be quashed on the Wiki soon. Cant help but wonder what legal ramifications there may be for the wiki if this lazy (read: heartless) attorney feels it is hurting his business.  Users/WesP

20101230 16:26:41 nbsp On the right, is that two monitors on a stand? At first I thought it was an ultrawidescreen, and was trying to figure out the size.  I love my current work set up too :D  Ive got a 23 wide and a 20 square that I tend to rotate.  Love my monitors, though I wish I had a 27. Users/EdWins

20101231 05:51:17 nbsp The Amtrak page seems pretty rediculous to me now.  On the one hand, William puts up a phone number that Amtrak doesnt want published for any Tom, Dick or Harry to call.  On the other hand, you removed the Wikipedia train link, that might interest some people.  Id venture to say that most people dont know everything in the article.  So while its true, as you stated, that most people know what a train is, it is roughly equivalent to say that most people know what Amtrak is and so, the Amtrak page should be removed also.  It wouldnt make much sense to restrict info about Amtrak (unless Amtrak asks for a restriction) by deleting the page and it doesnt make much sense to not let a person have the option of having a link to get more information about trains.  Besides, the wiki links are so neat. Users/BruceHansen

20101231 08:54:37 nbsp Thats really cool!  When I was at CVEC in 05/06, one of the lab groups had dual 24ers  at the time I was amazed because it seemed pretty rare for a lot of people to dualscreen, much less have them that big (in 05/06).  I would looooove a triple monitor setup, by just adding a 27 to be my center display.  I do a lot of microscopy, and recently bioinformatics, on an actual workstationclass computer, and dualscreening is a neccessity.   I need to spread things over big displays and need screenspace so that I avoid scrolling and zooming out.  Interestingly, I tend to prefer the 20 square monitor over the 23 widescreen.  Microscopy images tend to be squares, so the widescreens lack of height becomes an issue.  Also, a standard monitor rotated vertically is still good at reading papers/pdfs, but feels less extreme than when a widescreen does it, mainly because I cant get used to it and dont have the patience to try.  Users/EdWins

20101231 09:02:12 nbsp Also, this was from years ago and done quickly (didnt tilt images in photoshop to make it perfect). Coworker got a new monitor that he couldnt set up til the afternoon, so I borrowed it for a few hours.   http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/982/desktopdork.jpg pic link. I think it was a 22 next to a 17 square. (At the time, I had 2x17).  Boredom and procrastination! Users/EdWins

20110101 01:12:39 nbsp Just to head off anybody: no, I did not miscalculate the time in putting up the logo.  I just happened to put it up close to exactly an hour late.  I was moving a ton of stuff in our barn because the window broke and there is a wind storm with bursts of rain.  Bleah.  Light as the Nashville snow and weather has been, I miss either the valley fog and northern California winters or the crystal skies and predictable showers of a South Florida winter.  NorCals late summer heat and dry grass beats hurricane season for the win.   Users/JabberWokky
  Geez, would people really complain that you werent up to change the logo at 2 AM your time, on the dot?  Were a pretty sorry lot if so.   Sorry to hear about your window.  Users/CovertProfessor

What to stop me from changing my name to REAL COMPUTERS & FREE DIAGNOSTICS and getting benifits from all caps? I mean .. if I simply need to make the name of my business be in all caps for this kind of thing to be ok then I will do exactly that ... Please change it back.  Users/RealComputers

20110220 20:44:30 nbsp Hey look .. if you go to the acutal website for IFix Electronics you will find that this IFix Electronics is how they made theor own name on their own website. I see no indication that caps is how their name is. Based on this I am going to change it to what is on their website.  Users/RealComputers

20110221 09:47:54 nbsp We all know that Brian just cares about minimizing any perceived advantage his competitors might have over him on the wiki. He does not care about the wiki itself. All caps in a list stands out, so that cant stand! But all caps on the business page? Its not distracting people from Real Computers, so thats fine. Users/WilliamLewis

20110222 19:32:18 nbsp Are you sure about that link on the JC Scandal page?  After all, even the rumormonger deleted it, presumably having second thoughts.  When I first saw it, I even thought it might be a black hole candidate. Users/CovertProfessor

20110222 19:59:20 nbsp That all makes sense to me.  It just seemed to me that it could be a potentially harmful rumor about minors (but I am not sure about their ages).  I also dont see that the events are puzzling without this information.  One tamer story is simply that the girls were not, according to the coach, team players, and when the coach tried to talk to them about it, they dropped the fword, etc., walked out of the meeting, and rest of the story ensues.  As for why no one wants to talk about the reasons for the firing  the Vanguard hinted at one point that the coach may have been fired because the girls were of a minority race and when the mother complained to a person of the same race, the coach got canned.  As I suggested, there are a lot of stories flying around. Users/CovertProfessor

20110222 21:32:05 nbsp But that wasnt the talk page that we were editing... Users/CovertProfessor

20110222 21:52:45 nbsp Hi, just saw your comments on my user page. I didnt notice that there were still caps on the IFix page. I will change them as you requested/mentioned, however I do so caustiously because WilliamLewis has set his sight on me again, coming out with fists blazing. I dont know if you read what he wrote in response to my comment on the talk page for IFix but I found it to be very rude and not at all a justified response to me comments. Still I will make the changes. To try and avoid an edit war I am going to quote your comments on my user page in the talk page for IFix, but if you would rather I do not please let me know or you can remove the text yourself. I dont want to quote you if you dont want to be quoted.  Users/RealComputers

20110222 23:26:29 nbsp love it!!!!!! Users/CovertProfessor

20110225 08:43:35 nbsp Youre aware of the new website.  You might not be aware of what appeared to be an obscure place in the lower right corner of the front page in Wednesdays paper with the cryptic title of this article to announce it.  http://digital.davisenterprise.com/featuredstories/wechoosetogotothemoon2/ Users/BruceHansen

20110227 08:10:45 nbsp Hiya Evan  I guess it is in the eye of the beholder. I understand your perspective however.

20110228 20:39:20 nbsp I dont see anything negative on Lauren Vaage Construction. Are you sure? Users/WilliamLewis

20110301 20:46:22 nbsp So, Evan JabberWokky Edwards, if a page has been DELETED, and the page name actually no longer exists (like if you write it as a link on a page it comes up with dashed underlining, as though it has to yet be created), where do you find it? What titlebar? what info icon?  the whole thing is gone.  Users/YCSifu

20110301 20:51:51 nbsp Im not at all sure that hes a Daniel or that he ever goes by Daniel.  Ive only ever seen his name written as Dan. Users/CovertProfessor

20110301 21:06:40 nbsp If he signs with Dan, that seems definitive enough for me.  What point is there to use Daniel if he himself never uses it?  Plus, we have pages for Sue and Joe  so, why not Dan? Users/CovertProfessor

20110301 22:02:34 nbsp Yes, Evan JabberWokky Edwards, I realized that. But then all those comments are just halfconversations (like communications with no feedback,  remember how error prone computer printing used to be?  remember what solved that?), almost as bad as orphan pages, ... sort of (not quite because of the link to your profile).  But someone looking at my profile page, with interest in what my concerns are, would have to skip back and forth between our profiles to get the actual gist of our conversation, and I wanted to save them the inconvenience.  Otherwise, why make our conversation visible at all to others? Users/YCSifu

20110302 13:40:34 nbsp Re: BBD  Mediocre food and lots of it.  I even found this to be true of the breakfasts, and its just not that hard to make breakfast!  So, in my opinion, youd be better off breakfasting elsewhere, e.g., Delta of Venus. Users/CovertProfessor

20110315 09:26:11 nbsp Does the Users/PhebeEvania page seem a bit hinky to you or am I out of line thinking it seems like a scam to solicit funds for an overseas business more than a page that has anything to do with Davis or the DavisWiki community? Users/WesP

20110316 02:58:27 nbsp Randomly just viewed the http://wikispot.org/Wiki_Directory and was shocked to discover only 25 states have any kind of LocalWikis set up. I was thinking, since Davis is a conglomerate of students from around the nation, let alone the world, that it would be nice to have a local page here for students/residents to have easy access to the Wikispot with information on different states and cities with no wiki info that could use a helping hand from former residents... What do you think? Is this something that is already covered by the localwiki project or would it be too intrusive for the DavisWiki? Users/WesP

20110317 14:49:57 nbsp whoa! that was speedy. Thanks! Users/jsbmeb

20110317 15:18:20 nbsp Good point JW...  thanks. Users/WesP

20110318 18:01:45 nbsp I am so glad people like you exist who are able to bring smiles and chuckles, if not outright guffaws to people in general. Users/WesP

20110319 15:17:32 nbsp I view you as being one of the most neutral and fair people out here on the DavisWiki, and as such hoped you might take the time to add your two cents to this new page: Wiki Community/Accusations Users/WesP
