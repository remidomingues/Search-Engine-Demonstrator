Sterling/University Village is probably one of the worst places to live in Davis.  There are a lot of amenities offered, including hot tub, pool, billiards, gym, computer lab, tanning booth.  The billiard table is OK, but how much time can you spend doing that?  The hot tub is often broken and not much warmer then the pool.  I have never actually used the tanning booth, but I stepped inside it once and it was scary.  The absolute worst part of U. V. is that they claim to provide internet when in fact they really dont.  There is something here they call internet but it doesnt really function.  Often you can surf the internet slowly, but you cant get on Aol Instant Messenger.  When you can get on AIM, the internet probably wont work.  If you do manage to log on succesfully, dont get to happy about it because it will probably only be about ten minutes before the connection logs you off again.  Good luck getting back on hah.  It is also QUITE expensive, nowhere near worth it. Users/GeorgeLewis Sir George Edison Lewis

20070329 18:11:03 nbsp Yeah, lots of people complain about management. But considering the problems with residents and their apparent immaturaty, it is fairly apparent that morale of the management would be fairly low. A guy upstairs gets drunk, passes out and lets his washing machine fill until it leaks all over his floor as well as the two apartments below him and across from him. Every time I go outside after a weekend there is garbage and broken glass all over the place. Lights are dismantled, broken, etc. The elevator is often vandalized. People here have no consideration for their fellow residents, and the management, in my opinion, reasonably has no respect for many of the residents. Now this is not to say that it is highly irritating to have repairs neglected, which is illegal. The internet is somewhat unstable, seeming to go down at random times, but 99% of the time it is fine. The hallways are dirty, but like I said, they do get cleaned, but it is just a vain effort. Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070603 11:04:01 nbsp I dont know what this trash talking is about, I currently live here (07) and have had no complaints. I moved out of my old place over winter break and was desperate to find somewhere new. I dont think I couldve found a better place. I dont mean to sound like a kiss ass, but I really love it. My room is ENORMOUS  double a dorm room easy a mastersuite in a 3/ 2, I pay 600 flat a month, which is ridiculous considering my friends in Adobe pay over 650 for a tiny 10X10 box.  The management has always been friendly and helpful, maybe these arent the same people that were working here 2 years ago, or maybe I havent seen their ugly side. Ive only had 1 bulb go out and our internet works perfectly, its slow between midnight and 3 am or so, but 80% of the residents are online. I havnt ever been unable to log in to AIM, but I think I can live with slow internet for a few hours out of the day, considering its FREE. Maybe I just got realllly lucky, or maybe this place is getting a bad rep that it doesnt deserve. Users/Alicia

20070822 20:24:36 nbsp So I am coming up on my 1 year in UVD and I thought I would post a summary of everything.

I hate living here. The room mate matching program is a joke, all they take into consideration is the fact that two people are homeless. I ended up getting stuck with two automotive school students and it feels like I am back in the dorms. I guess it would be ok if you had 3 other people moving in with you that you knew.

The management is very nice, and thats about it. They are the most incompetent group of people I have ever come across. When you ask them to do something it probably wont get done. Having applications and paperwork with Social Security Numbers being lost is commonplace. Yet when they ask for money from you, it happens within 12 hours.

There is a significant number of car school students here, and they are the ones who commit most of the vandalism, yet the management is reluctant to kick them out. My room mate flooded our apartment and the two below us, spray painted the entire patio and has caused other damage to the apartment on top of stealing complex propertyall of this is known to the management yet they refuse to kick him out. If you are looking for a place where you wont get kicked out then UVD is the place for you.

Additionally, the place is located on Cantrill Drive, if you go look at the Davis PD crime logs, chances are you will see incidents for Cantrill Drive, and given that the only residential complexes are this one and a retirement home, I strongly doubt that much activity goes on there. Also, the cops are always here talking to people. Not a very safe place in my opinion.

The internet has gotten better, but not by much.

I feel taken advantage of for living here, I would avoid the UVD at all costs. Users/BrandonMinow

I apologize ahead of time for the length of this comment, but I hope that it will be helpful along with the shorter postings above.

I previously wrote:

The hallways are dirty, but like I said, they do get cleaned, but it is just a vain effort.

Now I have been here for a while and am dealing with the renewal.

As wikizen Brandon Minow noted, the roommatematching program is not all they make it out to be. My girlfriend was moved in with a girl with some severe desire to control everyone in the apartment, all the way through not allowing her to buy a dish rack and pounding on her door like a maniac. Not only did she drive my girlfriend out, but also her friend by threatening her and screaming in her face, calling her horribly vulgar names all the while. Management of course never kicked her out but just refused to let her renew which she probably wasnt going to do anyway. I got pretty lucky with my roommate matching. But of course, there is more to the story.

I moved in and they put me in a room that was filthy, as if someone had died in there from not cleaning. It smelled like every bad thing you can think of. There were flies, garbage, cups of beer, and filth everywhere. Apparently the then maintenence staff told the office that the apartment was clean. Oh well, they moved me and it was fine, but I was without a room for three nights.

Now I originally wrote that there is a problem with vandalism here. Someone even attempted to break into my girlfriend’s apartment one evening at around 3AM after a wild party next door. Everyone living here knows exactly who is destroying the complex. We have all seen it and the office knows who it is, but for them it is all about the bottom line and staying in the black. You see, they were at somewhere around 80% capacity for the last year according to Marie in the office, so they can’t afford to kick anyone out.

Now of course, the management is overall very unresponsive. For at least a month the maintenance was nearly nonexistent because Marie fired them (probably rightly so). Someone was sent out from another Sequoia property in order to take care of things, but there was too much to take care of. Luckily we have a new maintenance person here named Scott who is extremely helpful and seems to be the one person on the management team genuinely concerned with customer service and he even actually enjoys his job.

Of course the unresponsiveness ends as soon as your money moving to their account concerns, but Sequoia Equities seems so tied up in bureaucracy that can’t disperse checks faster than 68 weeks.

This of course leads me to reevaluate my previous assessment of low morale on the part of the complex. First of all, when you drive in you are greeted by a sign that say “ROCKIN’ THE HOUSE” and “LIVE THE LIFESTYLE YOU DESERVE.” I have been waiting for Clint Eastwood to ride up with cigar in mouth, dismount his horse, paint the place red and write “WELCOME TO HELL,” but I digress. In a way, I don’t blame people for destroying the place, after all management is advertising it as a party complex, and their unresponsiveness and passive aggressiveness would spark discontent in anyone.

Speaking of passive aggressiveness, let’s talk about this weekend. My girlfriend and I went home for the Labor Day weekend, and when we returned her lock had been changed. Now somehow she was not aware of this, and of course none of her roommates either. It also happened to be 1:00 AM, so there were no signs of life around the place. Now there were scheduled lock changes, but no way for her to get a key. They even have an emergency maintenance number, but it is disconnected.

Fastforward to this morning, Marie in the office has another side besides sweet. Maybe this has to do with the seeming revolving door of staff in the front office, though it does seem to have stabilized a bit recently. When my reasonably irritated girlfriend asked why she hadn’t been notified of her new key being made, how she was supposed to get it, and all the questions you might consider asking after being locked out of the apartment you pay rent for overnight, Marie simply says that there was a notice on the door of the office (not of the apartment) to call Katie, who would then come and unlock the door. But of course, it wouldn’t matter if Katie had come to the door because the keys were never made not until this morning when my girlfriend needed them. Marie’s attitude seemed passive aggressive, and the apology offered was not sincere but rather “I am sorry that you made a mistake and locked yourself out,” nor was any compensation for her night locked out of her own apartment offered. There were at least two other enraged residents at the time we went into the office this morning. This is the first day of my renewal period, and I am beginning to regret ever moving here in the first place.

Of course now they are moving up to 90% capacity and getting very strict on a lot of things because they are now going further to the green. Parking is no longer free; each apartment of four rooms is assigned two spaces, which are of course tandem spaces (meaning that if I am parked in the front, I have to find my roommate to back out from behind me in order to leave). In order to get more parking, I have to pay an extra $40 a month. It used to be that the tandem spots were for rental at $20 a month, and the covered spots were $25 a month, and that any spot not covered nor tandem was free to park in. Of course Holly in the office says, “It sucks all around.” This of course leads me to wonder that if it sucks so badly, why are the parking rates being raised? Well of course, to make up for losses cause by giving away the tandem spaces. I am not sure how many people actually rented tandem parking over the last year, but none of my roommates did.

BTW, to the poster who mentioned a lawsuit, it looks like someone might be taking them to small claims court, go look at http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CADavisUniversityVillageformerlySterlingUniversityVista663243.html and be delighted. There are some major changes that need to happen here in order for this to be a place worth living, and if you are happy living here I am happy for you.

I would say to seriously reconsider moving into this apartment complex. In some sense I hope that this review turns away a few people thinking about living here. The problem with the complex is not the “stigma” associated with the riot here a few years back as Marie says, the problem is the few people in the office carrying out the will of Sequoia Equities in a completely unrelenting manner. I would be glad to be evicted so that I could consider the multitude of better places to live here in Davis. I could write volumes more, so if you are interested or have any questions feel free to contact me.

20070902 14:40:35 nbsp This is probably the WORST place in davis to live. I tell everyone i know to stay away from this place. i even met a girl who was looking to talk to management about moving in and told her NO WAY would she be happy here. She got in her car and drove away. They offer money to you if you refer someone but that would be unethical. I would feel terrible if i did that. I have been living here since DEC 06 and REALLY dont like it at all. first of all the room mate matching system is aweful, they really dont care. I had a terrible experience with one of my roommates and had to find a new apt which management did very little about. It took them 2 weeks for them to write out a list for me of other available rooms even though they said one would be ready the next day. They didnt even try to find people i was compatible with. I had to go door to door. Fortunatly i did find some nice people to live with.

My apt got flooded because a guys washing machine overflowed upstairs. we had dehumidifiers in out apt. for 4 days and the place was really unliveable. part of the ceiling was destroyed and there were holes. the carpet was soaked. The management did absolutely nothing to compensate us for the condition of the apt. they didnt even give us a break on rent or anything. it was probably because i didnt demand it, but thats not the kind of person i am. i guess thats what you get for being understanding. Also, the maintenence didnt even have the decency to finish fixing up our place. They cleaned the carpets and patched up but didnt ever repaint. our apt. looked horrible.

There is always something wrong with something in the apt. but you can request to have it fixed but chances are it will never happen. The appliances are no good. oh, but if you miss a rent payment or go over on your bill, you will get a notice the next day...amazing where their priorities are.

Late one night I got locked out of my apt. after i renewed (yeah, ill NEVER do that again). I guess they change the locks every year for security reasons. its really stupid because they change the locks in the morning but wont allow you to pick up the key until 3 pm in the afternoon so youre basically stuck in or out of YOUR apt. anyway,  management tried to tell me it was my responsibility and that the keys were in my mail box. well, they werent and neither was a flier on my door saying the locks had been changed like they said there would be. They told me i shouldve called their after hours number and someone wouldve come into the office and given me my keys. Well, there were no keys because no one took the time to make them when they were supposed to.... when i finally did get a key it didnt work becasue it was made incorrectly. i had to go get another. despite THEIR error it was still somehow my responsibility. Their apologies were so insincer it was humerous. Marie was rude to me and made no attempt to better the situaltion. Personally i find people in the office rude. There are new people working in the office every other week called temps and thats really what they are. They dont know anything ever and are always gone in about 2 weeks.  I think i have seen about 20 new people working in there in the last few months. i dont know what it is....but is seems like no one can stay hired for more than 14 days. As of now there is only 1 maintenence guy to keep together 400 something apts. not possible. he is very nice, but overworked. i blame management! HIRE more people!! Also, they are supposed to be open form 10 am to 5 or 5:30 but they close at random hrs. and are always late getting back. I even had one temp walk past me, unlock the door to let herself in and the promptly lock the door after herself preventing me and several others from entering even though the sign said they shouldve been open. She didnt say anything. RUDE!!

My favorite is the way they advertise. Rockin the house, live the life you deserve. ummmm, ok. whatever that means. There is a picture of a guitar suggesting a really fun laid back atmosphere. They post fliers on campus with pictures of people rockin out and having loud fun. oh no. people here are destructive, and dont care one bit about their neighbors. There is 3 day old vomit in the halls and broken bottles and trash everywhere. The elevator is typically destroyed and i have heard there has been broken glass in the pool. (which i will not go in). They allow pets but the lawn typically has poop on it. Management always acts over worked and tired and im sure they are....but what do you expect when you have a slogan and fliers like that????

Overall, i think this place is aweful. The rent is WAY to much for what you have to put up with. I will never rent here again and dont recommend anyone should. Yeah, it seems great at first and that was what i though....but once youve been here a while youll realize its really terrible. Management doesnt care and they will walk all over you if you let them. Dont expect to be compensated for anything. All this place wants is your rent check.....that is NO joke. Im serious. They dont care about the resident at all. If i had to rate it i would give it 1 star. At least i have a roof over my head but that is about all.

Oh, yeah, They say they are woking on imporving this place but i can see absolutely NO evidence of that. If anything I feel like i am being treated worse than when i got here!  Users/AnneKabala

20070903 22:12:09 nbsp Hello again,

In the continuing movein/out debacle going on over here, apparently 24hour notice to enter is on notice. They sent a flyer out two weeks ago stating that residents should expect vendors and maintenance staff to enter their apartments anytime from 9AM until 10PM from September 1st through September 28th. This obviously does not constitute 24 hours notice, but whatever.

Apparently someone was gone for the day, and a vendor entered the apartment to replace the carpets. In order to do so, the furniture had to be moved off of the carpet. The workers put the residents sofas and TV table with the TV still on top of it outside. The sofas and his TV were both stolen when he returned home. This all occurred completely without the residents knowledge; he had no idea the staff was even going to be entering. The only reason he is going to be able to get new stuff is because he had an upgraded renters insurance policy.

EDIT: I should add that this is hearsay. There is a possibility that the renter was aware that his apartment was going to be entered. There definitely was a theft of his sofa and television.

Very shady dealings have been occurring lately.  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070912 00:35:50 nbsp Whenever I drove into the complex I saw the aforementioned Live Life Like You Deserve banner and thought to myself EVERYTIME: I must really be a bad person to live this horribly. Avoid. I do not doubt the move out fiasco. This place doesnt care about anything except trying to stay in the Black.

They did tell me that they are in the process of getting rid of the non University students, ie. the ones who are causing the problems. Users/BrandonMinow

20070912 13:46:13 nbsp Ok so my experience when i lived there: OMG worse place ever to live! The staff at the main office is never around, even tho the office is open, its hard to find someone actually inside working during normal business hours, they tend to avoid the tenants. They lost my records during move out time, so they didnt even know i was a resident there.... they thought i was someone else.... tried to charge me for like 4 months back rent (based off someone elses records) i didnt get my deposit back until six months later.... the management is a mess.... and if they want you to come into the office for some reason... they pull stupid stunts like cut off your internet until you come in and talk to them. I seriously dont recommend this place.  Users/WeMo

20070927 07:49:11 nbsp qwerty, perhaps lose the anonymity and you will have the opportunity to move :)

About the fair housing, they really cant kick people out that arent university students, and I dont think they should. They have a funny way of offering different deals to different people, and it is solely dependant upon whether or not you are a wyotech student or a UCD student. In fact, their files in the office have UCD or WT written in the top right corner next to each persons name. One time a WT studnet called looking for housing and was denied, a few minutes later his girlfriend called and said she was a UCD student and they said they had plenty of vacancies. Discrimination, anyone?  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070927 11:22:39 nbsp I have been meaning to leave a comment on here for a long time.  This is now my third year living here and I thought I would comment on everything I have been through with this complex.  I was going to move out but life sometimes sucks and I thought it would be too stressful to move out.  Anyways, Ill start with the first year when they lost my rent checks three times and tried to charge me late fees for their error even though I had my copies of the checks.  Then they sold me a covered parking space but I quickly realized that it was stupid to buy a space since there was plenty of parking.  I wrote them a letter saying that I didnt want the parking space anymore.  They of coarse lost this letter and months later decided to send me a bill for hundreds of dollars for a parking space that I never used.  When I moved in, I was told that only the covered spaces were purchased and that you could park anywhere else. wrong, and I found that out when I went to the parking lot and found my car gone.  I was then crying in the office thinking that my car was stolen but no it was towed.  The only nice thing that they have done was not make me pay to pick up my car in the scariest tow place in dixon.  Fast forward to my dryer breaking and them taking three months to fix it or when my bathroom door randomly fell out of its hinges and it took them 2 weeks.  By the way, why does a door fall off its hinges when no one had slammed it, weird.
None of this is against the maitenance people, I usually feel sorry for them.  It is the management that doesnt relay anything to them.
Ok, now Im in this year.  Its saturday night and only one of my roommates is home.  Its 4am and someone decides to come through our second floor kitchen window and proceed to try to kick down my roommates bedroom door, thankfully the police are right around the corner.  Not only did this perv try to kick down a door, he had turned on a stereo in another room.  what the hell, why cant people steal things.  Fine, we were dumb for leaving a window open but when we went to tell the management only Maurice was there.  I recommend not talking to Maurice about any problems if you actually want them fixed.  Anyways, we wanted all of the locks changed out and obviously the door frames fixed.  I didnt have any confidence in Maurice, so I called that monday morning to find out that Maurice hadnt told anyone else in the office about the break in and that there was no maintenance order for anything.  Nice.
It took 3 days for the door frame to be fixed.  On top of this, no one believed us that someone had scaled the wall and gotten in through our window besides there being an obvious broken screen.  I had to retell the break in story multiple times and they told is that it must have been one of our previous roommates.  Yeah b/c our hundred pound ex roommate who we still hang out with decided to kick in a door at 4am.  Thanks for the help and I feel really secure knowing that a security guard drives by maybe twice a night.
 I wouldnt be as angry if anyone in that office knew anything about customer service, like when clients walk in, you shouldnt look away and ignore them.  You should also apologize profusely for wrongs.  I have heard sorry maybe once and that was from Maurice, so i know how genuine that was. And yes, that vomit stayed on the stairs for a week before anyone hosed it down.  Its very true that they only want their rent check.  If you are late on rent, that is the only time that you can get management to pay attention to you in any prompt manner and I mean next day they will send you a 3 day notice.  Im very tired of dealing with these people, i cringe going into the office or calling them. Users/MaijaMangrum



20070928 00:49:37 nbsp I should probably clarify what I meant about them getting rid of the nonUniversity students. From what I was told, they are going to let them ride out their lease and then deny them the right to renew, not straight up kick them out.

The staff does want them out because, as they told me numerous times, they are losing money from all the vandalism that goes on in the apartment complex. Users/BrandonMinow

I could probably think of other complaints every day but heres one that I forgot.
They gave us a wonderful 2 weeks notice that there would be repair happening in our apartment.  What they failed to tell us was that painters would come in and move all of our furniture and then leave paint on my couch and then carpet cleaners would come in and clean the carpet around our furniture and then come into my room and scare the crap out of my cat just to clean the area right in front of my bed.  What happened to 24 hour notice and why did the have to come into my room at all. It would have been really nice if they had told us any of this was happening so I could have locked my door and moved my firniture so that they could have done an actual thorough job of cleaning and painting.  They painted around hung up pictures.
My roommate read my previous comment and said that I was being too nice.
And the parking, once in the entire time that I lived here have I not been able to find a parking space.  Stop scamming us into more money UNLESS you actually hire more competent staff. Users/MaijaMangrum

20071006 13:59:49 nbsp Currently there are roughly 15 unrserved parking spots at UVD. All of the covered spots have been bought up. For anyone who doesnt live here considering it, this is the parking situation. Each apartment gets two uncovered parking spots. There are four people living in my room. We each have cars (for any University Village management, that is four cars total if you didnt count before assigning spots). One of us bought a covered spot, the others didnt. One of my roommates risked parking in a reserved parking space, and he was towed by the owner. We have a tandem parking spot, which is wonderful if you are best friends with your roommate or want to store your car, because the way it works is that one car is in front of the other and locked in place.

Anyway, there are a few visitor spots available if you are lucky, and if not I dont know what you should be doing, and neither does management. They told my roommate when he asked why he had to risk being towed every day that YOU shouldnt have to risk it every day! Of course they tell anyone who has there spot blocked to tow immediately. This costs $190 and a drive to the worst place in Dixon: Jeds Towing Yard. I am seriously wondering whether UVD gets some sort of commission for towing, because when you move in they give you a little card from Jeds with their phone number on it.

I also seriously recommend that everyone who is dissatisfied with their experience to closely and carefully examine their leases, their is a chance that it was never signed in the first place and you are on month to month. Of course Marie did not sign any of them on the same date as we did, so if you look at her signatures there is probably no date next to it. I dont know what this all means, but I am certainly going to seek advice from someone who does know.  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20071015 21:15:51 nbsp Of course the management gets a commission from Jeds.  Oh and that emergency number that they claim to have is constantly busy at all hours of the day, every day.  Its really effective when the fire alarm is going off  at 2am or when you get locked out of your room and have to call a locksmith. Users/MaijaMangrum

20071019 16:53:43 nbsp this is for sure the worst place to live, the office is not just unorganized and careless about fixing things, or the concerns of the residents, but theyre a bunch of thieves who will charge you money for everything, they dont even care if its illegal. they will probably and hopefully get sued soon. the place is filthy and their so called roomate matching program is a complete joke. basically, dont bother living here, its overpriced and the management is terrible and there are tons of other better options here in davis.

20071025 11:24:54 nbsp this is the most horrible, disturbing place i have ever lived. I felt duped and dumb for having been suckered into living here. I would rather be living in a hotel room. I cannot wait until this year is over, please, no one should ever live here  Users/adamc328

20071104 13:24:48 nbsp seems to have a lot of crime and destructive behavior. the most recent news letter says they are having problems with vandalism, noise complaints, police being called, and more. it is definitely annoying to hear people shouting angrily at each other calling each other out at 4 in the morning after they have had way to much to drink, but i dont know how the management thinks it is legal to start fines. now if there is a noise complaint your apartment gets fined 250 or so. it seems like they keep making up random rules and random fees and fines and always change their minds about stuff. like the pet messiness. people leave pet waste all over the complex and so it is pretty dirty. managements response is to threaten a pet rent of 25 a month for all pet owners instead of just the ones that are making the messes. also, the fines for anyone who gets a noise complaint on them neighbors that dont like each other are just going to start calling up the security people (they are an off site agency I think) to get their enemies fined. on the upside, it seems like the management might be TRYING to do stuff, even though they are just making up totally random rules that have no basis in our lease or anything. there is nothing that says they can make up random fees and fines.
the parking also really sucks. i have been towed twice because even if i wanted to park in a covered spot, they are all taken and would cost 40 a month if they were available.
i would suggest allegre. people seem to like allegre enough, and it isnt as dingy as other davis places. it is probably as nice as this place only better because you dont have to deal with the car mechanic students breaking into things, breaking beer bottles, sifting through the dumpsters, and revving their engines all the time.
My rating: decent, but i have liked other places in davis better. i particularly like adobe but they charge a lot for security deposit stuff if you dont fill your form out well. Users/SaraS

20071107 04:08:57 nbsp Its funny because I dont even live at the university village. When I look at this place, I think of it as a really nice place to live, only if all the troubles were removed. So I went ahead and emailed the corporate office with a long letter about how many things at the university village should be changed. If they send me an email back, i would definitely post in on here for everyone to read. Hopefully if they straighten out all the problems, i might be a perspective tenant all over again. Good luck to everyone that lives here. Users/heyitsvu

20071110 15:58:31 nbsp I recently moved in and I can honestly say that things are getting better. The manager that was rude to everyone doesnt work here anymore. The girls in the office are hella nice to me. I use the tanning bed all the time. Someone said that it isnt really a tanning bed, but obviously you dont know what a tanning bed looks like. Someone else is complaining about the newletter, but you make no sense... you are mad about things that happen here, but you are also ragging on the solution they create! make up your mind. it is getting better, and the girls in the office are trying. Give them a break. If anyone of you had a solid job where you had to use customer service you would know its hard. We had to deal with a horrible property manager and they had to WORK with her EVERYDAY!!! Users/Ktbard

20071114 23:30:03 nbsp ktbard, you are a hella dedicated UVD employee! I mean, do you seriously expect people to believe you live here when you say random things that make no sense and try to cut out EVERY slightly negative thing on the site? fair enough that you want the site to make the complex look good, but from the history of the page you go on here and edit everything out on a daily basis. it is like fashism. ten bucks says youre the blonde person in the office.
I am going to try to post up a summary of the stuff thats got erased since you started messing with the page underneath this comment.
And by the way, I am sure like all the people on this and that live here have had customer service jobs and done really good at them. Most of the office girls arent that BAD but they dont know what the hell they are doing and fck stuff up a lot. Probably as dumb as fish. (srry fishies)
When did the manager quit? (It wasnt before I got the pleasre of meeting her cheery face gag) But for reals, is the new one changing stuff? Users/SaraS

20071120 10:34:29 nbsp I have lived here for 2 years and I think this place is what you make of it, and most of you just make it seem bad.  There are people here who like this place and actually really like the office staff who bend over backwards to help you out. Most of the people on here seem like whinny little bitches who have nothing better to do than sit on the computer and cry about how bad it is to live here. I say you should get your fat ass off the computer and stop eating your sorrows away and worry about something else. I would have to say don’t live here if you hate it so bad, get out of your lease and move on. This is my home and I really love it and I am happy to fork over the money to live here, trust me I have lived in worse places. On thing I find so petty is the girl who says she did not get enough oatmeal, is there nothing else she could cry about??? Fat girls and nerdy web geeks move on and stop bitching about how bad it is to live here, no one forced you to move in. It would be funny if they had a gun held to your head and said you had to though, maybe you would have the right to gripe. All in all I am happy here and glad this is my home! Users/Purduerunner82
        Interesting comment, especially when trying to reconcile this notes agitated tone with your final declaration of happiness. Users/ColinMcEnroe
