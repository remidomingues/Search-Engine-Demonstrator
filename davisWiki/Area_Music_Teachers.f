The three resources for music teachers and lessons in Davis are Davis Music Teachers Association, the UC Davis Music Department, and http://www.watermelonmusic.com/bottomnavbar/instruction/instruction.htm Watermelon Music. The information on this page is partly derived from the http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/~dmta/teachers/dmtalist.html DMTA Roster, and also lists nonDMTA teachers.



Can anyone recommend a classical or ragtime piano teacher?

20090306 19:02:55 nbsp As a rule, youre lucky to find a teacher with openings, never mind recommendations.  In any case a recommendation would depend on your age, commitment, and skill level.  You should contact one of the piano teachers listed here to get a good recommendation.

20100109 10:01:41 nbsp Could someone please tell me how to add myself to this list?  I am not DMTA but I have already set up a Davis Wiki page.
http://daviswiki.org/Kindermusik I teach Kindermusik childrens music classes rather than private lessons.  So the instrument listed could be Kindermusik.  Thanks, Amy Users/musicamyl
  Edit this page. Find the appropriate place in the order to add your information. Insert a new line. Begin with {{{||}}} as that is a table separator and youll be adding a new table row. In the first cell type the name of the instrument followed by {{{||}}}, then your name followed by {{{||}}}, your openings followed by {{{||}}}, your email which you might want to display using the mailto macro {{{MailTo(amy AT provider DOT com)}}} followed by {{{||}}}, and your phone followed by {{{||}}}, then the section of Davis, membership in DMTA, and any notes all separated by and ending with {{{||}}}. If there is a page for Kindermusik you will want the link to it to be in the form of {{{Kindermusik}}}. Preview your changes, and adjust any typos youve made and then click Save Changes. If that doesnt work out, then leave another note here at the bottom with your information so someone else can add it and then remove your comment.Users/JasonAller

  But you shouldnt add yourself many times. Users/GregKuperberg

20110811 19:15:51 nbsp Watermelon instructors are scammers!  I have gone to 3 different instructors, and they really want to teach you at a snails pace so they can collect their $2025/lesson (or $100 monthly fee for some) with minimum effort.  practice picking up the violin.  next week Ill show you how to hold the bow...    AVOID!! Users/GeorgeG
