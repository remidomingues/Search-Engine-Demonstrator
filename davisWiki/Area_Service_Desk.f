The Area Service Desks are located in each of the three UCD Dorms dorm areas(Segundo, Tercero, and Cuarto) around campus.  Students in the dorms come to the desk if they lose their keys, have a package, or want to check out games and equipment. The ASD also processes room transfers and handles resident checkin and checkout each year.

When checking out items from the desk, it is important to understand the various late fees.  Remember: They charge you to be responsible!

 Recreation equipment, games, cooking utensils  24 hour limit/ $25 fine per item
 Keys or Access Cards  3 day limit(including day of checkout)/ $25 fine
 Lost Key or Lock Change  $50 fine
 IMPORTANT  Residents receive 4 free key loans per academic year.  The 5th loan will result in a $25 penalty that essentially purchases 4 more free loans
 Bed configuration tools
 Vacuum Cleaners
 Mail service, including both mailboxes and packages
 Emergency maintenance requests (for nonemergency, please submit a request via MyUCDavis through the housing channel or through the Student Housing websites Repair Request page)
