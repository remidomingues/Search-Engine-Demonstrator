Arsen Ari Kalfayan successfully ran for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate on the Student Focus slate in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.  A native of San Carlos, California, Arsen Ari Kalfayan earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science with minors in Communication and Global and International Studies in 2006 from University of California at Davis.

Ari Kalfayan was the President of the SOS Ski or Snowboard club (the largest social club on Campus) for the 20042005 school year.  Kalfayan lost his bid for reelection to current SOS president, Kyle Ochenduzsko.

Ari Kalfayan regularly brought his laptop to ASUCD Senate meetings.  This prompted a ASUCD Senate Senate bill that would prevent Kalfayan from using his laptop.  The bill disallowed the use of laptops by Senators, and was passed 111, with Kalfayan the sole No vote.

Upon graduation, he began his career with Fisher Investments as an Account Executive. After serving in positions of increasing responsibility, in 2008, Kalfayan was promoted to the Institutional Group where he served as a Materials Production Associate.

In January 2009, Okko Grippando and Kalfayan cofounded Reason to Party, dedicated to fulfilling the financial needs of charities in the San Francisco Bay Area benefitting underserved populations.

Hahahaha, You crack me up phil!  If you havnt learned, my image in the public light wont be shaped by the wiki, nor with stupid ammendments which pass through the senate, thus changing a photo to a more flattering photo or putting up well phrased comments will have no effect in the public light, nor my confidence.  I love the attention though!!!  I have some nude pics want those too?  haha just playing.  If you realy want good photos of me, my catalog will be coming out soon, its going to let me show my versatility as a male model! Users/ArsenArikalfayan

 Discussion 


Senators wrote a bill to keep Kalfayan from using his laptop. It passed 111, with Kalfayan voting No.:

   Funny that they have to inroduce a bill rather than say Ari, can you please not use your laptop at meetings? Youre not the senate recorder, its rude...  Users/ArlenAbraham
     Actually, he was asked politely by Jenn del la Vega and Kristen Birdsall, but he responded with something like I dont care what you think. Theres no rule against it, and until you write a pointless bill to make it so I cant use my laptop I will continue to use it.
     what an ass. heres an interesting article in the http://www.dailycal.org/article.php?id13605 Daily Cal about what happens when senators use laptops.  Users/ArlenAbraham
     for note, its not necessarily against him but because he reminded that we could write a bill against it.  The bill was written because we feel that internet usage during meetings is against the spirit of the Brown Act and also because we believe that any research being done during the meeting could be done before the meeting.  All of the senators and commission chairs sitting around the table receive an Agenda early Thursday and have access to the bills that are due to come up (sans urgent legislation) as early as the Monday before meetings. Users/KristenBirdsall
      Do you guys have fact checker monkeys? Like if you get in a disagreement and you can yell hey fact monkey, whos right here? and the fact monkey will use his laptop to check that out. if you had fact monkeys, senators wouldnt need internets.  Users/ArlenAbraham
        I would like to congratulate you on making me spit out my coffee with your change comment solution: monkeys!.  Users/JabberWokky
        If something that questionable or critical comes up then we can table the bill and probably should table the bill.  Users/KristenBirdsall
          Just for note, the current process seems to be calling a recess or redirecting to a commission instead of tabling.


That is one sexy picture that you took Kris.    Thank you all (wiki people) for the flattery, as I am very excited to have legislation written for me.  If anyone actually wants to       talk about the subject at hand, all you have to do is come talk to me or could even call me.  If not, come watch as the bill comes up, because I promise to put on an excellent show.  Thats why they call me the great entertainer.  Signing out and cooling out!!!  Ari Kalfayan
  That would be a fine and dandy response if you were just another wikiuser, but youre not, youre a public figure with responsiblities. One of these responsabilities is communicating with your constituents. Youll notice that Rob Roy your favorite person keeps a http://www.livejournal.com/users/senatorroy/ livejournal that people can read. As a constituent, I say bringing a laptop, and such a massive one at that, is rude. So why do you do it? You get cocky with us (still your constituents) and ask me to call you (not that we have your number). A publicly posed question deserves a public answer. Youre up.  Users/ArlenAbraham
  Note the ironic distance between Aris willingness to communicate using AIM during senate meetings but his fear of getting caught in an Internet Argument on daviswiki. Users/TravisGrathwell
 I have to say I absolutely love the arguments we have on wiki, although I would prefer them to be on subjects the average UC Davis student cares about.
 That is one sexy picture that you guys took. So Im plural now am I? (  Users/KrisFricke (PS: picture wasnt taken to illustrate the laptop, picture was taken to make another panorama of the senate.  Kris Fricke has no stance on the laptop issue.)
  I may be one of the few to think so, but I say the laptop bill is a stupid idea.  Users/BrentLaabs


Id be happy to answer any questions you or any other wiki aficionado would have, provided I read my page (since I dont check up on the wiki very often.)  If you would like to get a hold of me please email me at ucdsenator@yahoo.com or call me at 5307501767.

I do believe sincerely that this subject is one of the most ridiculous things that the senate could address, yet to no ones surprise, this subject has been pushed to the forefront of legislation.  I am very disappointed that people would focus their attention on a piece of legislation which is useless for the student population.  If you have any question on the legitimacy of the lap tops importance at senate meetings or my personal choice to use it, please contact me and I will be happy to discus this outlandish subject.

As for me and Rob, I have no problem with him as a person, nor as a senator.  Although we might not vote together on certain subjects, I still respect his opinion and listen intently to his arguments.

I hope the wiki feeds off of this subject and we get another huge discussion page out of it because apparently Im only here to serve for entertainment and controversy.

Quote from senate minutes:
  Kalfayan said I am using the computer unless you pass legislation that states otherwise.  It has helped me in the past.  I disagree with passing something else thats useless. I really feel that there are some things that we shouldnt be passing. Considering that we have spent an hour and thirty minutes on events, I cant even really concentrate on whats at hand. There are thirteen and fourteen events thrown at me at one time during public announcements, with all these dates and times that it is really easy to get lost. I really want a different way of doing this, thats how I feel.

This is a paraphrase of what I said at the senate meetings taken directly from the senate minutes which can be accesses from http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/gov/senate/   from the April 21st minutes.  I dont feel that what I said was outlandishly inappropriate but please do feel free to discuss this issue with me further and I do apologize for any miscommunications that occurred during the meeting or past incidents for that matter.    Love you all.  Ari Kalfayan

I want people to comment, but it hasnt happened since I actually adressed the issue!  Come on wikisters, I want an open disscussion, I promise to make it fun!


Hey, Ari! Why not have an intern come to meetings and sit behind you with a laptop so that he can look anything up that you might need looked up if you need it so bad. (This is similar to the monkeys solution) Users/KenBloom

you know what ken, that is the first piece of constructive critisism ive heard and I thank you.  I will talk to my new interns and see what we can muster up.

I think everyone who cares about aris using a laptop during senate meetings, let alone writes about it, needs to get off the internet, get a life, maybe a shower, before you all die pathetic virgins!!!

To all those who opposed to laptop usage during senate meetings, the laptop reinstatement act of 2006 is up for discussion tonight.  Introduced by Arsen Ari Kalfayan, this bill will change senate history.  Hahahhaha!!!  If this bill passes tonight, Ari will have won the war, and I for one am glad.

Yeah, Aris bill failed...

This asshole spams my email every week or so.  Maybe somebody should have cut off his laptop privileges earlier.  Eat one, Ari.
