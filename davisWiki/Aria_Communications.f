20050831 00:20:36 nbsp Do they do anything else besides Instaconnect? If not, they should just call themselves Instaconnect  itd be so much easier. Users/DatNguyen

20050831 00:53:05 nbsp Another company named http://www.ariacommunications.net/ Aria Communications does telemarketing.  And I posted this, you know, just because. Users/BrentLaabs

20050831 01:02:37 nbsp Well, the only answer then is to ask Ryan to add better country music to the ariacommunications.com website. Users/DatNguyen

20050906 20:42:48 nbsp What does country music have to do anything? And why would I touch the website? I am not a webmonkey. Users/RyanCastellucci

20050906 20:47:25 nbsp You should put up arias.  Plusmore opera on the internet! Users/BrentLaabs

20070211 20:08:33 nbsp http://www.yolorecorder.org/recording/fictitious/lookup/index_html?rname%22REEDY%2C+JOHN%22&submitSearch According to the Yolo County Recorder, John Reedy is the owner of both SoliSys and Design Works. Arias site lists Reedy as CEO. US Housing and Aria dont have Fictitious Business Names fictitious name records at the recorder, though. Unless Arias own site is inaccurate, it is accurate to say that Reedy owns Aria, SoliSys, and Design Works. Users/WilliamLewis

20080731 18:15:51 nbsp Instaconnect is perpetually poor in certain areas of Davis.  If you can use Comcast instead, I highly recommend it, because instaconnect can be down for hours at a time.  Very disappointing. Users/PhilosopherDave

20080913 20:09:25 nbsp Couldnt agree more with PhilosopherDaves comment. If youre moving into the Viking, make arrangements with Comcast beforehand because the internet will not work the lions share of the time. Users/AlexChiang

20090110 19:27:10 nbsp Consistently unreliable service, out for days at a time across multiple apartment complexes.  Customer services efforts entirely directed to playing defense and strongarming customers to meet 100% of their contractual obligations to pay for services, despite said services failing to be rendered  e.g., ignoring their own repeated and flagrant breaches of contract by failing to provide contractually obligated services. Instaconnects network has had nothing even approaching five nines (99.999%) of uptime, nor even three. Internet loads at pedestrian speed during hours of common use, at least until the network goes down for a day or more and logs everyone off. Aria seem to employ a revolving army of secretaries who, to an absolute fault, are never authorized to do anything but shill to protect their polluted profit stream. No refunds, no discounts, no amnesty, no customer care or service of any kind. Wretched company with a pathetic product, both of whic reliably and consistently disappoint. Users/GWHenry

20090220 12:39:02 nbsp I couldnt disagree with PhilosopherDaves comment more.  I have had HORRIBLE experience with Comcast and would recommend a friend to sever a limb before accepting a contract from them.   Users/MasonMurray

20091005 10:14:39 nbsp John Reedy is the slimiest owner imaginable.  Do not let InstaConnect have your credit card number!  They continued to charge my account after I had cancelled the service and deployed to Iraq without access or knowledge of the charges.  Lie after lie to my face and months and months of calling and leaving messages I have given up on the promised refund.  This is no business!  This is a racket for defrauding Davis students. Users/reidgardner

20101004 13:49:56 nbsp I have to agree with the comments about Aria Communications and Instaconnect.  There is neither anything instant nor connected about their socalled service.  They have a revolving door policy as far as employees go, and now that John Reedy is doing the tech repairs none are happening. Connectivity is sketchy at best and down on average.  Use any provider but these guys or you will be sorry. Users/Britva613

20131004 14:00:39 nbsp Are they any good with user privacy and data integrity?  How do they afford to stay in business?  Do they get any subsidies?  Any silent partners? Users/gdnystrom
