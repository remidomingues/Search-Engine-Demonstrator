20070822 18:39:59 nbsp Hi Aree, I believe Steven is asking that you click the Preivew button first when you make changes instead of simply clicking Save after you make little tweaks. If you take a look at the Recent Changes tab on the top, youll see your page has 20some edits by you, if you had previewed some of those changes first, there wouldnt be so much editspam for your page ) Users/VladLoscutoff

Eva takes a loooong time to grow on you, Ive been thru the series and the movies a couple times, and each time you notice more and more and more. keep in mind when the series was penned for the first time the author was clinically insane. Users/StevenDaubert

  Mr. Daubert, you are a ridiculous person, and you like ridiculous things. Im also a big Eva fan. But really  the important question is whether you like Gurren Lagann. ct

20071117 00:33:49 nbsp Hi Aree, just curious, which email address did you send the letter to SJA to? sja@ucdavis.edu? Users/AlexQuan

20071117 00:42:27 nbsp Nope, its correct. Now I know who to talk to in my office. Thanks. Users/AlexQuan

20071117 00:53:57 nbsp Absolutely not, I work for them/with them. You have no worries. Users/AlexQuan

20071117 01:04:09 nbsp I understand, it gets nasty on this wiki. I can explain to you the process of it, most likely I wont be working directly on that case unless it goes to a formal hearing. Right now, however, an SJA officer will reply back to you via email about the allegations you brought up and theyll take it from there. Users/AlexQuan

20071117 01:09:48 nbsp Youre welcome, if you have more questions about the SJA process, dont hesitate to ask. :) Users/AlexQuan

20071117 10:01:28 nbsp Hey, if youre worried about the nasty little comment you got, I read through your letter and thought it was well written. Thats judging it by the similar letters I have read that were written by a wide variety of people at all stages in life during my years as a manager, business owner and member of various committees. The nasty little pompous paragraph written to you reeks of ignorance through innocence of the way the world works. You did fine, speaking out in very measured claims that were reasonably phrased, and when you posted it publically to show that claims had been made, you made quite a stand. I only wish I had followed my first impulse and commented that it was well written before you received such a harsh reply. I have a feeling that, contrary to the assertions made, youll do quite nicely in life. http://cheshirehall.net/link/ws/smile.png Users/JabberWokky

20110130 11:50:14 nbsp Hello! I moved your comment abut Young Hall to the page itself and added a comment bar. Talk pages are generally for issues relating to the style or content setup of a wiki page and not for general observations about the actual person/place/thing the page is about. I dont recall ever seeing things in young hall but Ill admit that I found the basement rather foreboding for some reason. Users/ARWENNHOLD
