Ariela Haro: Ariela has a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in Music from UC Davis. She plans to pursue a Ph.D in Music History and become a Mozart specialist.

While in Davis, she hosted a hit radio show on KDRT called Arielas Appassionata. The show was so good that it replayed four times! It is also played spontaneously throughout the week. Arielas Appassionata was the only classical show in Davis, although apparently an opera show is in the planning stages.. Ariela also volunteered at http://www.capradio.org KXPR, the classical station in Sacramento.

In May, 2007, she moved to wiki:Madison with her partner, Users/KarlMogel Karl J. Mogel.
