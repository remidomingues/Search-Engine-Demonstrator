20070714 10:29:22 nbsp RUN FAR, FAR AWAY.  This is the worst dentist I have ever been to.  I originally went to them as a new patient just for a cleaning.  When I went in, they told me I needed a root canal AND had 13 cavities that had to be filled immediately.  My parents believed this to be ridiculous, so I went back to my old dentist.  He looked at the same exact xray as these guys and said that not only did I NOT need a root canal, but I only had 4 cavities that needed to be filled over the next 6 months.  He couldnt find any trace of the other cavities.  I would never go back to this Dental Practice, and I recommend the same to you. Users/Kellie

20080118 22:18:01 nbsp   I have been a patient of Dr Hung for almost two years she is great. The office staff are friendly and very helpful.  Dr Hung  takes the time to explain any concerns she is having or any questions I might ask . I never feel like she is rushing for the next patient. That is great!  This office recieves an A from me.

20080124 08:53:19 nbsp Having seen a number of dentists over the years, I have experienced all the ups and downs, believe me. After being a patient of Dr.Hung for 12 years, I am extremely happy. She is always concerned about my comfort and keeps pains at a minimum. I have rarely seen a dentist so dedicated and thorough. I can highly recommend her and her practice. What particularly impressed me was one situation where she was not 100% sure about a diagnose and consulted with the other dentist in front of me (the patient). This shows highlevel professionalism and particularly that she is not guided by issues and attitudes (like some other dentists) but instead her goal is only to do what is good for the patient. The front desk support is friendly and reliable, too, in respect to flexible scheduling as well as billing. Here you are a name and not a number. Providing the quality remains unchanged, I will be a faithful patient here for a very long time. Users/Tobi

20080128 09:09:35 nbsp I am not sure of other patients experiences, but I have been with Dr. Hung for a couple of years and have not been told I have 13 cavities or a need for a root canal. Her diagnosis of my teeth have been sound in my opinion. I have admittedly weak teeth and have only had the need for a couple of fillings with Dr. Hung. Furthermore, she has shown the utmost care for the wellbeing of my teeth. Barring the fact that she doesnt have available any laughing gas for those of us who dislike the thought of dental work, I recommend Dr. Hung.  Users/Anthony

20080128 14:40:42 nbsp DONT RUN  RELAX AND GET HEALTHY. Dr Hung is a great dentist. She is very gentle and walks you through every detail of the care she thinks is appropriate for you. If you dont or cant have it all done, then she will take care only of the teeth you want done. + the secretary and Dr Hung will check everything with the insurance and tell you exactly what is covered. When I go there, I could almost take a nap. Everybody is nice. Its the best dentist experience I have had. Annabelle Users/Annabelle

20080129 13:52:10 nbsp I saw Dr. Hung yesterday and was reminded of how wonderful she is!  We started seeing her a year ago when my then8 year old had a dental emergency.  My child had previous negative experiences with a dentist and was very nervous when we went in.  Dr. Hung was amazing.  She was kind, gentle, and told my child everything she was doing.  After seeing how well she handled my childs situation, I made appointments for our entire family.  It has been a long time since Id seen a dentist due to dentistphobia and Dr. Hung was incredibly patient and kind with me.  She goes slowly when I need her to, keeps me informed of what shes doing, and takes great care to be sure I am comfortable.  Her office staff and dental hygienists are equally wonderful.  I would highly recommend Dr. Hung to anyone, particularly those who are nervous about seeing a dentist. Users/JBD

20080209 09:39:09 nbsp I have been a patient of doctor Hungâ€™s for the past couple of years. Every time I go in for either a cleaning or a larger procedure she has been kind, professional and very gentle. When I come into the office the doctors and staff makes me feel at home. They are all very knowledgeable and know exactly what needs to be done. Her expertise is evident in everything she does. I feel as though she deeply cares about the health and wellbeing of her patients and does all she can to provide the best care possible. I think that few people can say that they actually look forward to going to the dentist, but in my case this is entirely true. Users/Ligia

20080220 00:40:52 nbsp Ive been a patient of Dr. Hung for the past three years.  I go to her for my biannual teeth cleaning and the services Ive received are excellent.  I highly recommended to anyone who is searching for a good dentist.  Users/Cannic

20080417 14:12:57 nbsp Dr. Hung was incredibly gentle, and kept me totally informed of what she was doing. I had chipped a piece of my tooth, and she pulled the chipped part out without charging me anything more than a normal dental evaluation. I definitely recommend her!  Users/Puja

20080430 10:44:17 nbsp I was very worried when I first went in since I havent seen a dentist in years, but from the moment I walked into the office, I felt very calm and my anxiety diminished. The desk staff were very helpful, especially with questions about paperwork and insurance. Dr. Hung was incredibly professional and personable. She made sure I understood each procedure and  that I was comfortable with them. She even helped me plan out the rest of the year so I dont have to pay too much out of my own pocket. I definitely recommend this office to anyone, especially to students on  SHIP. I will most definitely stay with this dentist for the remainder of my college years. Users/hannah.lee

20080514 16:48:09 nbsp Dr. Hung is so great. Today I met her for cleaning and annual exam. She found several cavities but she said
I need only one cavaty that had to be filled immediately. Front desk people explained me how much will be covered on my insurance. She is very nice to explain everything. She explained how to maintain my teeth in good condition. She is very patinet, nice and professional.I would highly recommned her to my friends and to you! You should meet her then you can understand what I am saying! Users/choko81

20081218 16:35:02 nbsp On December 9, 2008 I was a patient of Arina Hung DDS of Sycamore Lane Dental Care,I was absolutely astounded by the things that happened: 1)The consummate professionalism based upon demonstrated high levels of acquired knowledge and the ability to share relevant information to her patient in an informative and appropriate manner; 2) when she touched me to tell me something, she touch me with kindness; and 3)her staff followed suit in their professionalism and kindness. I got a tooth filled and doctor Hung made sure that the tooth was perfectly drilled, filled and in line with the other teeth(bite placement) when she finished. I have been going to dentists for over 40 years, this is the best service that I have ever recievedit astoundingly exceeded my expectations!  I actually look forward to my next visit. YES! I SAY IN ALL CANDOR IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE TREAT TO GO TO A DENTISTS OFFICE! Arina Hung DDS is the best ever! It was a genuine pleasure! Chet777. Users/Chet777

20090605 15:21:07 nbsp This is the best dentist Ive ever met. Dr. Hung is incredibly professional, patient and graceful. She always cares about his patients and makes them feel at home. I had a root canal, tooth clean and crown under her and Dr.Farahyar treatment and she always asks me how I feel and keeps the pains minimum during the treatment. She is extremely dedicated and knowledgeable. She explains every details of what needs to be done and make sure I know the best of my teeth and she is taking care of my teeth. She did the crown so carefully and patiently that she makes sure the crown fits perfect in line with the other teeth. She polished the crown at least ten times to just make sure I feel extremely comfortable with the crow to put in. She also suggests what needs to be done immediately and what is not that urgent if you have multiple problems with your teeth (like me) and cant afford to have them all done at once. She and the front desk also plan the schedule for you for rest of year and next year so you can use the maximum of your SHIP insurance and saves your money. Dr. Hung takes the time to explain any concerns she is having or any questions I might ask and suggests how to keep my teeth in good condition. I feel she really deeply cares about the health of her patients and provides the only care which is the best for her patients. Her office staff and dental hygienists are also very friendly and kind. I highly recommend this office. It was a truly pleasure.   Users/songroad


20090721 15:38:32 nbsp Im not sure what Kellie is talking about but I have been going to Dr. Hung and Dr. Farahyar for 4 years.  I have been blessed with perfectly healthy teeth, so I have never needed any dental work past a cleaning.  I started going to Dr. Hung after my then dentist told me I needed 18 veneers to save my teeth.  So I decided it was time for a change and thought Id try my husbands dentist Dr. Farahyar.  I was seen by Dr. Hung and she was FABULOUS.  She was nice and put me at ease.  She told me my teeth were perfectly fine and I did not need anything other than a routine cleaning.  I have been going back since and in fact saw her today.  So DONT RUN FROM DR. HUNG.  Shes a wonderful dentist with a great bedside manner.  I highly recommend her. Users/olgalidias

20100318 13:54:55 nbsp This woman rocks.  Shes gentle, respectful and extremely conscientious. Im a pretty hard sell and this doc gets my vote.  Users/kjleinberger

20100423 00:29:56 nbsp As a UC Davis faculty member, I have to say that I felt extremely regretful to be introduced to Ms. Hung as I was told that she graduated from UCD. I agree with all the positive comments given on this site. Ms. Hung is a kind, gentle and respectful person. I experienced that thoroughly during my familys first few visits in her office. She was actually the very first dentist we had met since we moved to Davis a year ago and we valued that experience with her a lot. However, due to our serious concerns that we might have to spend about $6,000 to fix my tooth, we started to think about the possibility to choose the cheapest option to deal with my tooth first then have it observed a while before we decide to take a serious action on the treatment. We personally consulted with her during our dental appointments and contacted her via a couple of letters with regard to our serious concerns. Very unfortunately after our last letter, we received a formal registered mail from Ms. Hung to tell us that she failed to communicate with us and had to terminate our whole familys dental visits in her office starting from the receipt of her letter. She even used very strong and hurting words in her letter telling us that she would not be able to fulfill our expectations like OTHER dentists in my own country and the US. I was SO shocked to receive and read such a letter by a dentist who was a graduate from UC Davis (Of course, where she graduated from was truly not a main point regarding my comments on a dentist). I completely could not understand how she could assure that she knew all my past dentists in my country and the US, who could not meet our expectations due to our true experiences with them. If she cannot be certain about what she stated, I have to then take her words in her letter as personal insults.

The immature statements Ms. Hung presented in her letter was definitely a shock and depression to our family. Finding a new dentist for any families is absolutely not a hard thing to do; however, it is sad for us to experience with such a dentist, who appears nice and gentle, but in reality after our few visits, it seemed that we kinda saw through the cruelty in the field of dentistry that we got kicked out of a dental office because we asked questions concerning so much about our illness and the decision we had to make could not bring them some wealth. Through the online comments, I sincerely hope Ms. Hung can learn that writing such a letter with her strong mind at that moment was really not a smart and wise thing to do. I can forgive her because she was still young, but the real world will eventually make her learn that good communication skills and a TRUE kind heart and personality in dealing with clients or patients is MUCH MORE important than her professional skills. She will not be able to demonstrate her perfect skills if she cannot build up a longterm relationship with her patients. It will not be just a big loss of money but can be a straightforward harm in her life reputation. As a UCD member, I hope Ms. Hung can learn a life lesson from this experience and face herself to correct her manners to patients with truly decent patience. This is a good lesson I will put in my teaching files, used to teach my students, and hope that they will be respected by all walks of life when they start their careers after graduation from UCD.

20100811 11:20:31 nbsp I had not seen a dentist in quite a few years. I went and saw Dr. Hung yesterday for a checkup. I had never met her before. I had a very comfortable and pleasant experience. Dr. Hung is very kind, has a great bedside manner, and is very professional. Every time I had a question, she answered thoroughly and clearly. I recommend this dentist 100%. Users/KaoSaechao

20100811 11:21:38 nbsp And she accepts the UC DAVIS SHIP insurance which is a great plus. Users/KaoSaechao

20100819 23:00:10 nbsp Since 2007 I have seen Dr. Hung and she is the BEST DENTIST I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! She is extremely thorough, professional, kind and gentle. I had an ongoing pain on one side and Dr. Hung fixed it for me. She is very patient and explains what she is looking for and/or doing. I recently moved and I am so sad I wont be able to see her anymore. Finding a great dentist can be hard, but she is DEFINITELY ONE!! I would strongly recommend her to anyone in the area. Users/KatherineP

20120407 19:52:46 nbsp kellie is totally off base. This can not be the Dr. Hung our family knows. I have recommended Dr. Hung and Dr. Farahyar to many people, and all have been totally satisfied with their kind, professional, gentle, and honest approach to Dentistry.  Users/MarkVandeWater
