20060909 20:05:09 nbsp Hi Arlen Arlen Arlen.  I have a question for you. Users/SallyHensel

20061104 13:35:49 nbsp Always better to have more photos of something like The Worst Intersection on Campus that anyway. Plus the more photographers the more angles that get represented. Users/JasonAller

20061114 12:55:51 nbsp CourseCollab is bogged down until I figure out the copyright status of lecture notes. Users/VinceBuffalo

20061211 11:59:59 nbsp its one of the ingredients Users/CraigBrozinsky

20061220 23:04:26 nbsp If the page is going to be called UCD Alphabet Soup it really needs a picture of a bowl of alphabet soup... doesnt it? Users/JasonAller

20061221 02:10:03 nbsp If Users/SnowBeige is a penname, then it should be clearly linked from the page. If not, then it is a sock puppet. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061222 14:46:51 nbsp Regarding the DLC page, I think the emblem can definately go.  Not sure who put it there in the first place.  Ill leave it to you as you are better at making pages pretty than I am! Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20070105 17:03:05 nbsp Everybody knows if theres one thing THE MAN cant stand its pictures of wires. Shoulda known better than to take pictures of all those wires. Users/TravisGrathwell

20070109 17:09:41 nbsp As far as I know, Visor Lady moved far, far way to a land called Berkeley. The university gave her a bus ticket there and told her to leave Davis or something. Users/EliseKane

20070112 13:02:03 nbsp feliz cumpleaÃ±os Users/CarlMcCabe

20070126 11:23:15 nbsp awesome congrats! Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070130 18:21:45 nbsp you were right about the software stuff Users/DevinCastellucci

20070131 23:15:32 nbsp Thanks. By the way the random page when I looked at your page was Surge III, which is nowhere near as interesting as this page ) Users/TusharRawat

I agree that the empty food debate pages should have been deleted, but on {{{Food Debate and Analysis/Natural vs. Unnatural}}} there was real content and Users/KenjiYamada, for one, said it was worthwhile. It should probably be moved to a different page, maybe with a slash under one of the users involved or under one of the food pages. As for Users/JabberWokkys comment, I disagree. Look at Halema Buzayan, where alot of people who were new to wiki posted and discussed the issue. Later, many of the comments were reorganized for easier reading, but it is still a dialogue. The very existence of the comment bar means that Daviswiki was designed for dialogue, not editors on one side and readers on the other, and this is how it is used by most users. I think that trying to make Daviswiki be even mostly in the third person and a referencework sort of thing about Davis is impossible because, Davis being a geographical area, there are many social connections besides the wiki itself. People do not come here for the wiki, it is only a means of communication. The unique features of wikis would be and have been put to better use organizing dialogues to make useful information easier to find after people put it up in whatever style or form.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070210 13:21:03 nbsp How do you know that UPS entry is a sockpuppet? Users/JabberWokky

20070210 18:02:50 nbsp Id call it questionable at best, I was just wondering if I had missed something obvious that was certain.  Ive gushed on some entries myself (Java California springs to mind, where I even mentioned the manager).  The fact that that account only made the one single edit is the biggest question.  Im always curious as to the reasoning behind some types of edits. Users/JabberWokky

20070216 23:56:43 nbsp The Davis Food Coop is also considering opening a branch in the Westlake Plaza, which will probably be supported by all of their members who live in Village Homes. Assuming that the coop cannot do both expansions, you would be fighting all of those coop members, so I think the coop taking over Campus Roma is unlikely. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070217 00:04:43 nbsp My dwarf hamsters volunteer several hours of wheel running to help power Davis Wiki.  They like to start about two minutes before I go to sleep.  Let me know what kind of special set up I need, Ive got the hamster food already.  >.>    Users/EdWins ES

20070304 01:24:55 nbsp No need for the snide comment on the centering.  I just copied the menu from Tucos as a template. Users/DavidGrundler

20070305 11:53:20 nbsp I work with people in five time zones, I always calculate to their local TZ.  Good clarification, though... thanks.  I dont mind being woken in the middle of the night, but Sarah would probably appreciate not being worken.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20070305 15:24:42 nbsp I agree with your menu comments. Users/DavidGrundler

20070305 22:30:18 nbsp What is the purpose of the NeedsDavisRelevance and UCDCentric pages? Are irrelevant/UCDcentric pages just to be linked to those sites? Sorry if the answer is obvious. Users/LeonardMarque

20070310 23:38:23 nbsp I saw your nit on the fireworks page.  I actually left it that way because that is how it is on the Davis Municipal Code web site.  Bugged me too, and I thought about changing it. Users/DavidGrundler

20070311 00:44:48 nbsp Good times.  I wish the rest of the city could update their pages that fast! Users/DavidGrundler

20070402 20:41:01 nbsp hmmm. i heard differently. ill have to recheck my sources. where did you find out that dome 1 was of a different model? gracias. Users/JessicaRockwell

20070411 22:54:04 nbsp who would search for may1?  May 1.  May 1st. Maybe.  Youd think theyd search for the name of the event actually, not its date.  Im against silly redirects :P Users/EdWins

20070411 22:55:08 nbsp Ah, didnt see JAs comment about it being on the posters til now.  I retract ^^ Users/EdWins

20070412 08:09:38 nbsp It wasnt that someone had changed the formatting; the page had simply uncentered itself  I checked the edit history. Apparently the code necessary for centering had changed and I hadnt realized. I just wanted to keep uptodate and know what code was necessary. Also, I am aware that the Tucos page is a public page; I prefer the way the page looks centered, but if other people feel that strongly about it, its not a big deal to leave it uncentered. The first time I reverted it, I thought it was a persons personal opinion re: centering. Now that I know its not, I wont argue.  Users/ElleWeber

20070619 16:11:52 nbsp Hey Arlen, what was it that you got in trouble for photoing? It wasnt the cyclotron, was it?

And maybe Ill see ya soon...its been a while! Users/EliseKane

20070630 15:36:22 nbsp I think there may have been an anonymous helper, leaving no footsteps, fingerprints, and no edit history, somehow making the search work, amazingly enough, on his very birthday.

20080505 11:34:35 nbsp Hi, I just noticed the pictures of you vandalizing the Turtle House on wiki:wikispot:Launch. I had another picture on my phone of one of the broken ethernet jacks on the router, but I seem to have deleted it. I was not actually present when that box was installed, but I have been out there on that ledge messing around with it legitimately many times. I think the external antenna connectors were wrong for that router and were taped on because they wouldnt screw on, being the wrong connector. Nevertheless, it was working okay that way and I feel I should defend my excoworkers because I liked them. When I lived in the Turtle House, the router and modem were in the basement utility room and I was able to connect to it fairly well with my iMac and several sparcstations, none of which had wireless cards, using a WAP54G bridge in AP client mode in the room south of the kitchen upstairs. Such bridging would also have been pretty easy for you to do temporarily in Linux or BSD on one of the computers that had wireless, so you really didnt need to break into the box. Still, I think the equipment was probably better off in the utility room where it was before and that would have been better for your situation too. In the future when you are taking unauthorized advantage of other peoples network equipment, dont do anything that you cant or wont undo. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

   By undo do you mean put the lock back on the box?  Also, vandalism means intentional malicious destruction of someones property without their permission.  In this case he wasnt being malicious (we were trying to get to the equipment) and had permission.  The only thing that was broken was the lock on the box, but Im not sure why that was on the box to begin with (maybe they thought someone would steal the router?) Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Here is a picture of the damage:

  That jack is now unusable.
