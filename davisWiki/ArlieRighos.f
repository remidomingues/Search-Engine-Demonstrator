20130621 14:48:21 nbsp If you want to discuss the content of the Eastlake Apartments page further, then restart the conversation that we had on the Eastlake Apartments/Talk page.  You will want to say why you think the information should be deleted; my personal opinion is that since the information is true and potentially informative, it ought to remain.  It is an incident that happened in the past, yes, but the wiki retains historical information as well as current information. Users/CovertProfessor
