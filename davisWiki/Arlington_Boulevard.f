Arlington Boulevard is located in West Davis and runs from Russell Boulevard to the northwest up to Lake Boulevard.  Most of the area is residential, but very few residences face Arlington itself, and there is no parking. Brush Creek Apartments and the West Davis Station 32 fire station are the only residences with addresses on Arlington. There are several bus stops of the D Bus Line D, K Bus Line, P/Q Bus Line P and Q, and P/Q Bus Line Saturday P/Q Saturday schedule Unitrans bus lines, with a shelter and timepoint at Lake Boulevard and a shelter at Shasta Drive.
