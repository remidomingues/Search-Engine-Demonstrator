Armadillo Music is a small and friendly independent music retailers record store. They sell music, videos, and videos with music, along with diverse other items like vinyl, cassettes and Tshirts. You can listen to almost any CD in the store (except for special orders/box sets/rarities), new or used, at their three listening stations. The selection varies, but they are always willing to special order something not in stock and have it in a few days. If youre strapped for cash they also buy used CDs, DVDs, and vinyl.

Used CDs that dont sell quickly end up in the Bargain Bin near the door. Often, amazingly good music can be found in this nonalphabetized rack for under $6, with some CDs selling for as cheap as $2. If youre looking for a gag gift, there is no shortage of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys here. Cruise often, as the Bargain Bin is frequently replenished.

Thinking consumers appreciate the independent spirit and employees of Armadillo Records, as well as the always changing supply of used CD and DVD discoveries. If you are spending lots of money on CDs anyway, why not keep your business and tax dollars in a locallyowned independent retailer? Also, ask someone behind the desk to add you to the mailing list so you can get first crack at the bargain bins.

They also sell tickets to local venues.

They now sell Armadillo and KDVS tshirts at great prices!  Go in and check out the styles available...

 History 

Supposedly formed from the Buyout/closing of CD Research

In the December 2006 issue of Alive and Kicking, manager Paul Wilbur announced that he would be leaving Armadillo at the end of the month after 11 years of service. He cites the financial burden of having so many employees at a time when CD sales are dwindling as the reason for his departure. Note: Paul Wilbur is back (2009?), but doing other things to help the store.

The The Great F Street War rivalry between Armadillo and Dimple Records across the street was the focus of an article in Sacramento News & Review titled http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid623348 The Great F Street War.Footnote(Widmann, Ken. http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid623348 The Great F Street War. Sacramento News & Review. 20080214.) Dont forget that the Dimple Records location used to be a Tower Records and there was a pretty good rivalry back then as well.


I remember when Armadillo was located in the spot where Ray Johnston Designer Photography is. Users/StevenDaubert STDaubert

20070327 11:29:59 nbsp Has anyone noticed the awful smell and stuffiness of this place? It must be experienced to be believed, and if you spend enough time hunting for CDs here the odor will leave with you. Also, 3 for $20 on used cds is pretty expensive. $4$5 per CD is much more reasonable, though I will say that the three used CDs I bought from them are in such good shape they seem to be new. I just wish they would open a window! Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070327 11:56:27 nbsp Never noticed the smell, but it is kind of pricey for used. I traded in some of my CDs and got about 4.00 credit for each. Users/MyaBrn

20070327 12:33:11 nbsp I remember they used to have a record store.  It closed right before I started collecting vinyl. Users/BradBenedict

20070329 18:00:52 nbsp Yes, I wish there was a place to buy decent/clean or new records in Davis. You can always make the journey to Sacramento to hit Records on K Street or The Beat. I have never been to the Beat, but Records is a fine but somewhat overpriced place. They do have a very hit or miss $1.99 section at Records. But be warned that if you go there, it is reallllly funky, with middle aged guys in sweats and fanny packs looking through stacks of obscure 45s for records from the 50s that no one has ever heard of. Also, as far as $4 per CD, great, but what can you get for it? It is all relative to the pricing of the store.  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070401 14:04:39 nbsp I do agree, Armadillo is small and its too bad they dont sell vinyl anymore, but Im much happier with a store like Armadillo in town than having no such store and being forced to buy CDs from Borders or the awful UCD Bookstore CD section. Users/ChrisThielen

20070401 15:08:58 nbsp Interesting that you say this, I did find a few gems at the UCD bookstore: Bob Dylans The Times Are A Changin, Johnny Cashs Live At Folsom Prison being among them. Also, they were very reasonably priced for new CDs. Obviously they have nothing on Armadillo in terms of selection, but you can find some classics for a good price, particularly at the Corral.  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20080127 13:07:45 nbsp Armadillo is great and were lucky to have this store. Ive been cruising record stores since the 70s and they keep this great tradition alive. Lively conversation, eclectic tunes in the air, funky smell (havent noticed that, could be a personal problem), knowledgeable employees and a parade of interesting customers. Doesnt get any better than that. This place is a big part of what makes Davis special for me. And good luck to long time manager Dylan, moving on to other endeavors.  Users/DavidFeliz

20080510 18:33:32 nbsp They said they are going to start selling vinyl again in a couple months. Apparently they havent had any vinyl in the store for six years or so. Hopefully they get some good stuff. Users/OscarSabino

20080621 18:22:24 nbsp The vinyls are coming back!  I just saw some last weekend during their weekend sidewalk promotion.  Too bad I dont have something to play them with though... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080626 21:56:44 nbsp The owner of Armadillo has passed away within the last week or so. His memorial will be this Saturday.  I dont know exactly where, but its posted on their front door.  You could also call them up for details. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

The owner of Armadillo Music, Mike Krell passed away due to a heart attack on Monday. His memorial will be on Saturday from 15pm at the Palms in Winters. He will be missed!  Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080701 09:40:24 nbsp I also remember when Armadillo was up on G Street  I think.  I remember going to an interesting record store with the register in a center island.  I bought an Orbital CD that they were playing, and have since listened to it a billion times. (This was pre1998, when I was still in college and came to Davis to visit my girlfriend (now wife)).  Huhhuhhuh.  Im OLD. Users/BillKendrick

20080814 14:37:56 nbsp I have been a patron of this store for over 6 years now and still love it. Some think they are expensive. Try going across the street and compare stock on hand, selection, and yes, even price. Armadillo has them beat. Look at product knowledge and its the same thing. Half the employees are either in bands or are DJs independently or in association with KDVS. All are good people and they know their material.

I have made long lasting friendships with many of them and also know that if you want to order something, they will be able to get it within a matter of days, not two weeks, not I dont know what that is, let me see if I can find it, days.


Basically, it is one of the best establishments in downtown Davis and has really made an impression on the residents as a whole. If youve never been you should give it a try.

Oh, one last thing... someone mentioned that they have 3 cds for 20.00 which was incorrect, its three DVDs for 20.00 which has since changed to 4, with 25% off all their used cds in the bins.   Not expensive but truly inexpensive. edited by wesone at 2:48 pm on 08142008

20080814 15:18:20 nbsp I go into this place once or twice a week to get in on that 4 DVDs for $20 sale...and to talk to the pretty peoples... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081016 20:55:10 nbsp Armadillo is now carrying all of the KDVS Recordings releases we still have copies of. Dead Western LP (new!), San Francisco Water Cooler LP, Whos Your Favorite Son God? LP, and the Boss the Big Bit CD! Users/SimiSohota

20081209 19:00:53 nbsp lol, who is that really hot guy who works there? he is really tall, he helped me last time find a lena horne cd. i know im not giving enough information on physical characteristics, but its hard to miss him. thats an extra reason i go to armadillo. i actually like the small place, the atmosphere there over dimples..though i like dimples. just it feels cozy at armadillo and friendly. Users/KimberlyMiller

20100107 20:22:18 nbsp This place is a rip off!  They are selling CDs for $17.98.  Newsflash, its not 1994 anymore.  They sell used CDs for about $8 bucks.  This is ridiculous.  Go to Sac or the Bay area and you get a much better selection of used CDs for half the price. Go to Target or iTunes and get new music for much cheaper.

I have brought CDs in the past to sell and the staff is always really nasty and condescending.  Recently I brought in a huge stack of CDs and the guy behind the counter offered me 25 cents for each CD in the first stack and 50 cents for the other.  I knew he was gonna give me some BS so I before I approached the counter I checked to see what they were selling the same disks for......hmmm U2, Dave Matthews, Tom Petty, John Mayer, Led Zeppelin all were selling for $8 bucks or more.

Do yourself a favor and sell and buy your music elsewhere.  I am all for independent retail, but not when they take advantage of the public. Users/stodd84

20100125 15:19:27 nbsp Ive shopped at Armadillo for a long time because the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Back during his first stint here, Paul recommended the New Pornographers to me and Ive been a huge fan ever since. More recently, Jordan, Jason, and Audreys picks have been great for expanding my collection. Sometimes I wish I could stop spending money on music, but they keep recommending good stuff. Users/Risky

  They have their pictures and names next to their staff picks section. You might want to check it...perhaps buy that persons pick...maybe talk about it with him... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20110705 21:29:26 nbsp Ive traded music at Armadillo for several years now.  The staff is very knowledgeable of all genres spanning several years and Ive found their prices very reasonable, especially for their used cds and the price they are willing to pay to buy music.  I have nothing but positive things to say. Users/MarkSanger

20110807 09:44:26 nbsp Great place to get cheap CDs. They have sales pretty often, with varying degrees of cheapness. A lot of the bargain CDs tend to be much older, like from the 80s and 90s. I found Eiffel 65s Europop album here for about $1.00! The guys who work here are also really nice. Ive chatted with the owner a couple times and he seemed sweet. I liked the way he interacts with his other customers, and I really liked the fact that they dont take my bag away! (Unlike Dimple Records). I dont like being treated like a shoplifter, although since Dimple has video games, I can see their concern... but still.

I also LOVE the fact that they let you LISTEN TO THE CDS BEFORE YOU BUY THEM! There are three CD players in the back replete with headphones. If you find a CD youre not sure about you can pop it into the player and give it a listen. Just make sure you dont forget to put it back in the case. One time, I accidentally left one of my CDs in the player and ended up buying an empty case. Feeling incredibly stupid, I called that night and explained what happened (I wanted my CD! D:). The guy answering the phone kinda laughed but he was very nice and wrapped up my CD for me to pick up the next time I came in the store. In a protective sleeve! So it wouldnt be scratched up! Yay!

Its a little small and when its crowded it can be difficult to navigate past people but I actually like the smallness of the store. It makes it seem cozier and oldfashioned. Speaking of oldfashioned, I understand that they buy and sell vintage records and they seem to have a pretty good stock of them. I always see a collector or two when Im in there and they dont usually leave emptyhanded. There is a pretty good rotation on the selections available too! Definitely / stars. :) Users/nutmeg
