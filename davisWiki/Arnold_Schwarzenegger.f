Governor wiki:WikiPedia:Arnold_Schwarzenegger Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in as Californias 38th Governor on November 17, 2003.  His final term ended when Jerry Brown was sworn in on January 3rd, 2011.  Like many American success stories, Governor Schwarzeneggers began with hope and hard work.  Arriving in America from Austria at the age of 21, the Governor has since become one of the most recognizable people in the world.

Along with his successful careers in bodybuilding, movies and business, Governor Schwarzenegger was also the founder of InnerCity Games Foundation (ICG), which later became AfterSchool AllStars.  He was appointed Chairman of the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports by President George H.W. Bush and Chairman of the Governors Council on Physical Fitness by Governor Pete Wilson.  In 2002 he championed Californiaâ€™s AfterSchool Education and Safety Act (Proposition 49).

On April 20th, 2004 Governor Schwarzenegger visited Davis to kick off the http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7003 Hydrogen Highway Network. It was his first official visit to any of the UC campuses.  He then eventually returned to his LA home and his four Hummers, one of which is a prototype hydrogen fuelcell model.  While officially a Republican, he is considered moderate and has voted for historically Democratic positions on occasion.

The Governor returned to UC Davis on April 12th, 2006 to celebrate a $1 million grant from the California Clean Energy Fund to establish the new http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7713 Energy Efficiency Center, making Davis the only UC campus to host him twice since he was elected in 2003.

The Governor recently started a new live video Internet forum called http://gov.ca.gov/ask/ Ask Governor Schwarzenegger.  This is the first of its kind for the Governor, where citizens have the chance to ask questions directly of him.

Governor Schwarzenegger does not have a home in or near Sacramento, but once put his $18 million Pacific Palisades up on the market and was supposedly seeking a new residence in the state capitol when first elected.  Years later, he and his family still live in their LA (Brentwood) mansion.  Arnold used to spend about 3 to 4 days a week in Sacramento, where he stayed in the Hyatt Hotels Penthouse, across the street from the Capitol.  It wasnt long before he decided to simply commute to work  on a private jet daily from the Santa Monica airport to Sacramento.

The Governor is a former Mr. Olympia and was a major reason bodybuilding became popular, heading up the IFBB (International Federation of Body Building) and growing it into a huge organization.  He was an actor in various action films such as the Terminator series, Predator and Conan: the Barbarian.  Considered one of the business savvy entertainers, he has invested in various companies and run his own growing financial empire.
