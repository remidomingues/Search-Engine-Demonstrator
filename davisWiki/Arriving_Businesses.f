It keeps great and small on the endless round... for every business that folds up shop, new businesses arrive in our provincial town. So say bonjour! to the businesses that are on their way, and those that have recently opened.  Some temporarily depart/close and rearrive/open again along the way to becoming one of the departed businesses.  Going back into time (as recent as 2011, or as far back as the 1800s), you can read the Davis Timeline.

Wendy Weitzel of the Davis Enterprise has a column called http://www.davisenterprise.com/category/comingsandgoings Comings and Goings that tracks new businesses and those going out of business; the same information also appears in the Sunday editions of the paper and on her http://www.facebook.com/pages/ComingsGoings/191259469733 Facebook page.

And dont forget the businesses businesses that are already here!
