Arrow Jam is Pi Beta Phis philanthropy event held every Winter Quarter the The Pavilion at ARC Pavilion. Its usually held the last week of the quarter before finals.

Arrow Jam is a music and dance Greek Competitive Events competition (although technically a lip syncing competition, it has been twisted far from that) where the invited Sororities sororities and Fraternities fraternities often pick a theme and perform with mixed music, costumes, and props. They are scored on various categories and winners are chosen by Pi Beta Phis appointed judges.

This is probably the most intense Greek philanthropy event all year, and members of the Greek community plan and practice for it well in advance. It used to sell out Freeborn Hall when the event was held there, but in 2008 when it moved to the Pavilion, the larger seating capacity allowed for many more seats and thus they only sold out the floor seating area (where the Greek organizations who are performing sit). Many of the participants take Arrow Jam very seriously since it is the only time Davis sororities and fraternities have a direct competition.

During the first Arrow Jam held in the Pavilion, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pis performance was interrupted by faulty audio equipment. A premature intermission occurred that lasted so long Pi Phi tried telling jokes and threatened free style rap. Otherwise, it went well and might be predictive of future events held there.
