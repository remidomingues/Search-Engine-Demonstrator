One of many Parks in Davis.  This park has a Arroyo Park UFO UFO sculpture, too. Its length and Bike Paths bike path Bike Overpasses connection to Sycamore Park mean that it is very useful for travelling from West Davis to Central Davis on Bicycles bike or on Walking foot. The arroyo goes from the north side near Olympic Drive on Shasta Drive south and under a bridge where it turns east and goes parallel to the bike path. The arroyo is used when the city needs to drain the swimming pool.
A http://www.cityofdavis.org/story/?storycricketpractice Cricket Practice(broken link) area is at the western field (between the pool and elementary school) and the http://www.ncalcricket.org/html/clubs/davis.html Davis Cricket Club plays Cricket cricket here.

On April 30, 2011, Arroyo Park received a little landscaping TLC from volunteers with Mormon Helping Hands.

20081124 20:08:58 nbsp We found a black widow living in one of the childlevel nooks of the climbing wall. Normally we appreciate our arachnid friends for their beauty and for their natural pestremoval skills, but as this one was in a childfriendly area, not to mention in a nook where fingers are meant to be poked, we disposed of it. Ominously, there was also a small dead bird under the widows web.
There seem to be a lot of black widowfriendly nooks in this park (small areas which are dark for most of the day), as a matter of fact, so you should probably keep a close eye on your kids when they play there. And when it comes to the climbing wall, look before you stick your fingers in. :) Users/gurglemeow

20110708 01:37:00 nbsp I remember back in the summer of 2000 when Arroyo Park was not yet built. It was a barren expanse of wilderness and golden grasslands. The future park site was surrounded by dozens of homes that were currently under construction. Back at that time the area was so peaceful and empty. I would go for walks around sunset and tour the partially constructed homes. Times have changed. Users/MaxLucas
