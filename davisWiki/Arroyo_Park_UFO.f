A recreation of its trajectory can be found on http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mide1d31a65a9e0c41cd9aeba9549d62803 Googles 3D Warehouse. The saucer shaped ship embedded itself into the park during the impact, but quite a bit of it is still visible above the ground.  Alien writing can still be seen along the exposed edge.  The UFOs UFO also used to have an antenna, but it seems to have been the object of petty theft.

Upon its initial impact officials surrounded the object with chainlink fences. However, the fences have been removed and the alien spacecraft is now a popular place for people to Stargazing and Space Sightings stargaze, or simply to watch the frequent soccer soccer games that occur in the park.
