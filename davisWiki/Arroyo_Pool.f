Arroyo Pool is a public Swimming pool located in Arroyo Park. It hosts two pools, one is a lap pool and the other is a recreation pool with a neat fountain and a water slide. Its a great place to go swimming.

If you visit the pool frequently, you can buy different types of passes to allow unlimited access.

Since Summer 2008, the water slide is limited to kids over 48 inches, the slide is regulated by Cal OSHA, not the city or by the staff. All children under the age of 6 must be accompanied at all times by either a sibling or adult over the age of 14. All lifejackets and floatation devices must be US Coast Guard approved to be allowed in the pools, if your child needs a lifejacket they are available at the Guard Office. The staff of the pool reserves the right to swim test any patron at any time. Additionally there is no glass, alcoholic beverages or knives of any kind allowed into the complex.
