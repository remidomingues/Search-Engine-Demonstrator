Arson is a crime in which a Shadiness Factor malicious party sets fire to the house or property of another. Sometimes, the arsonist will target his or her own house or property to collect insurance payments.

Pyromania is related.  It is rooted in psychosis.  There was a teenage boy who set several fires about ten years ago.
