20080305 14:44:50 nbsp Pages with less than 50 words of content really dont belong on Explore.  It has too many things in a big disorganized list anyway.  If you want more people to see your content, thats really not the way to do it.  Try linking it in (and explaining the context) on similar pages, like Advising Services to get more people to browse through. Users/BrentLaabs
