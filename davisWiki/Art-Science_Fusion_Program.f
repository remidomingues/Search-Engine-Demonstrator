The UC Davis ArtScience Fusion Program is the brainchild of Professors Professor of Entomology Diane Ullman and ceramics artist Donna Billick, locally known for her The Dancing Pigs and Cow Fountain pieces located at The Marketplace and the sculpture entitled Mediation (art) in Central Park Gardens. The program has recently received a great amount of publicity. They are housed in the Environmental Horticulture Building.

Some of the public art that has been born out of this program includes:
  Tree of Life Mosaic Fall 2006
  Early Childhood Laboratory Mural  Fall 2007
  A Street Bridge Mural Winter 2008
