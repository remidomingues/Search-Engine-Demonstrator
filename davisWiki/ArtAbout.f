ArtAbout is Davis Davis monthly Art Galleries art walk. It takes place on the second Friday of each month from approximately 5 PM to 9 PM. Most venues hold their receptions at this time. Some businesses participate as ArtAbout venues along with most of the town art galleries. Printed maps are available at The Artery, Pence Gallery, and other ArtAbout reception venues. This is all free, of course.

It was founded by The Artery, and is overseen by a committee consisting of core members Stewart Savage and Nina Gatewood (Davis Downtown Business Association AKA DDBA), SandyThai Sandy Thai (RockBand University, DDBA), Natalie Nelson & Eileen Hendren (Pence Gallery), and Cathie Duniway & Diana Fong (The Artery). SandyThai Sandy Thai was hired by the DDBA in March 2013 as the new ArtAbout Coordinator. She is in charge of PR, matching artists with Downtown businesses, and producing the ArtAbout Guide and Map.

The Winters Art Walk is the week before on the first Saturday of the month, and the Sacramento Second Saturday art walk follows it (usually, depending on the calendar) the next day; these are also highly recommended.


If youve never been on an art gallery walk, I highly recommend it. Free food, great art, cool people. It changed my world. Really. Users/SteveDavison
