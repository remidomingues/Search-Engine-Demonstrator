From the outside, the aptly and creatively named address(Art Building, 38.539009, 121.748521) appears to be a rather boring three story tall building, especially compared to the eccentric UC Davis Main Theater Main Theater next door.  However there all sorts of exciting things to be found inside.

The Art Building serves as home of:
 Art Department The Art Department  including Art Studios woodshop, drawing, painting and printmaking studios, photo lab, and other facilities, Art History lecture halls, and faculty offices.
 The Basement Gallery
 Nelson Gallery The Nelson Gallery and Fine Arts Collection
 Technocultural Studies The Technocultural Studies Department until they move into their new home in the Art Annex

The Art Building is just across Hutchison Drive from Shields Library adjacent to the UC Davis Main Theatre. Sculpture students often display their work on the lawn or in the corridors outside the building. The MFA Art Studios are across the parking lot to the south.
