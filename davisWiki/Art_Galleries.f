Note: The Davis Art Association printed a very nice Gallery Guide & Public Art Walking Tour brochure in 2004. It lists most of the galleries listed above, along with photographs, addresses, hours, times, etc. Its almost as good as Wiki, plus its portable :). I picked mine up at the Artery.

The Yolo County Visitors Bureau also has the Gallery Guide & Public Art Walking Tour available at their office or they will mail it to you free of charge.
