The Art in Public Places program has sponsored many pieces of town art in Davis.  According to the http://www.city.davis.ca.us City of Davis website, Since 1973, the City has set aside 1% of all funds allocated for Capital Improvement Projects to purchase art that enhances the quality of the Davis environment. The artists selected through this program represent a diversity of style and media. Sculpture, murals, paintings, tile work, and functional pieces are located around the city for your enjoyment.  The city maintains a walking guide to the art located around the city, only available in print (not online).

The aesthetics of many of these pieces are often critiqued by a diverse range of people.
