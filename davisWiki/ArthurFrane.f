20100209 17:00:0 nbsp  Hey there, a belated welcome to the wiki!  I just wanted to note that your comment was moved from the Bizarro World entry onto its talk page at http://daviswiki.org/Bizarro_World/Talk?actionrecall&version660 Bizarro World/Talk, due to the recent conflicts surrounding the wiki entry.  As mentioned on the talk page, the wiki is fully transparent.  You can always hit the info tab on any persons account or on any page to see every single edit thats been made one by one.  You can learn more about wikiediting overall from that welcome page.  Cheers, Users/edwins ES
