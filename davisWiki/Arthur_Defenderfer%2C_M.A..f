Education, Training & Service
You can benefit from my many years of experience, specialized training and education.  I am a seasoned therapist dedicated to assisting you reach your personal, academic and career goals.  Part of my sensitive approach to therapy comes from my spiritual heritage.  I was brought up in the richness of a historical church where I felt the call to be a pastor as a child.  After searching various philosophies in college, I accepted Christ and joined a lively Spirit filled congregation, where I am serving as the Senior Pastor.  I am also a leader in the Good Shepherd International Fellowship, established in 1975 to promote unity among ministers and churches in the Body of Christ.
