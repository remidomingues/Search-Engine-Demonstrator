Artist Trading Cards: ATCs

 ATCs  Artist Trading Cards (aka Art Cards)  small (21/2 x 31/2 inch) works of art which are created by one person and exchange with another ATCmaker.  These little treasures are never sold, only traded (or gifted).  LoisRichter Lois Richter and Phyllis DeHaven worked for six months on the firstever public ATC Exchange in our region  (22 Sept. 2005).  It was preceded by three ATCmaking classes in August, a workshop in early September, a Davis Enterprise article, and lots of flyers and announcements.  More than 20 people came to the Exchange  most with at least a few cards to trade  and there was enough interest in an ongoing ATC group that two more 2005 swaps were planned and a new club was formed early in 2006.  Call Lois or Phyllis for current info about the ATC Exchange Club of Northern California.

Here are some examples of ATCs (The first set of images are all ATCs made by Lois Richter. Other artists are invited to add their own ATCs below.)

20100327 08:19:18 nbsp I dropped a half dozen one time around 2005ish, one of which was for the wiki, all with an ATC notice on the back on the table at the downtown Espresso Roma.  Anybody pick them up?  Another was a flower, another a crown, and a couple abstract items.  All were http://www.dickblick.com/products/kohinoorwatercolorwheel/?wmcpgoogle&wmcidproducts&wmckw003811001 watercolor and Sharpie marker on almond cardstock.  None were terribly good; I enjoy painting and drawing for the sake of making, and I do not have innate talent nor have I ever put serious discipline into it.  Users/JabberWokky
