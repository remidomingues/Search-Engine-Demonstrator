Past Performances


Their first production, Falsettos, received rave reviews.  Davis Enterprise Reviewer Users/BevSykes Bev Sykes said in her review, If the first production, Falsettos, now playing at the Hoblit Performing Arts Center, is any indication, Artistic Differences should have a long and successful life. Charles Peer, reviewer for Outword Magazine declared, ..the performances are as moving and as touching as I have ever seen.


Their second show, HAiR, opened May 5th, 2007 at The Space in Sacramento, CA and was a smash hit. Users/BevSykes Bev Sykes dubbed it an excellent, energetic production and David Jacobson of Village Life wrote this production may be better than the original. Thanks to generous support by local media, Artistic Differences production of HAiR sold out its entire run after the first weekend.

They also held a benefit show on Sunday, June 1st 2008 at 7:00 PM at the Benvenuti Performing Arts Center, featuring songs from past and upcoming seasons.
