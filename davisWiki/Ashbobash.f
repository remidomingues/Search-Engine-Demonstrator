20081013 11:23:10 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. Bobash, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Properly cooked burgers are a perpetual quest for my wife and I.  We are always looking for a place that does a medium rare burger correctly  completely seared on the outside and red and warm on the inside.  Usually we just try to order rare and hope that they dont say we cant do rare burgers, or even worse the state doesnt allow us to cook rare burgers, which is an untrue statement in any state Ive ever lived in, and yet Ive heard that over and over.   Of course, a place that doesnt know enough about food safety to know that they can cook one rare might not be the best place to get a rare burger.  At any rate, I just wanted to welcome you to the wiki.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
