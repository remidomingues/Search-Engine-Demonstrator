I have been trained primarily in Swedish Massage but by May 2013 will have attained a greater knowledge of Deep Tissue, Acupressure and Adhesion and Scar Tissue Release techniques. My goal as a massage therapy practitioner is to listen closely and adapt each session to meet your needs to the best of my ability. To date, I have 124 hours of massage training (including the basic 100hr Massage Therapy certification) from the Massage Therapy Institute in Davis, CA.  By May of 2013 I will have finished my 250 hour Massage Therapy program (and will be a CMP) and plan go on to get certified as a CMT with a total of 500 credit hours.
