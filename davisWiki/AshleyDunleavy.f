 Meet My Dog:Windy!

Windy is a very special little girl. She was raised at a sanctuary where she did not interact with people. When she was rescued two ago she was petrified of everything because it was all so new to her. Windy is doing fantastic, but she will always be a timid dog who needs a very special home that understands what she has been through.
Windy is doing wonderful in her foster home. She loves the other dogs and interacts with them very well. Windy has learned when she hears the leashes that she gets to go for a walk and she gets so excited and barks her enthusiasm. Windy is till pretty scared of being around new things and new people, but she is getting better every day! Windy is about 3 years old and weighs about 30 lbs.

20070316 11:50:39 nbsp And thanks Ashley for falling on the sword for me...I know you were only trying to stick up for me and I am sorry that you, too came under fire.  That wasnt fair and I apologise.  And Thank You! Users/CoreyDeRoo

20070316 12:09:26 nbsp Thanks for compromising! Users/EdWins

20070316 12:15:14 nbsp No big deal. I never intended to offend anyone, just state my opinion.  Users/AshleyDunleavy

20070917 13:46:01 nbsp Prima Donna is soooooo cute Ashley!  But then again I have a soft spot for white & brown bullies.  :)  And no, we cant take her.  Well be in a house next year though so we hope to get Jack a friend and possibly start fostering. Users/CindiDrake

20071005 09:36:55 nbsp Hey, you can just use .gif files... no need to convert them at all.  I cleaned it up a bit. Users/JabberWokky

20071015 10:18:26 nbsp Hey, Ashley... I think you need to convert those bmp photos to jpgs.  If you need, Id be happy to do it for you. Users/JabberWokky

20071015 10:20:42 nbsp (Id be especially happy to convert them if they are photos of yellow labs, but thats my wifes preference in canines showing). Users/JabberWokky
That would be great! I was just trying to figure out how to do that....
Labs usually go to lab rescue, so I dont get many of those :)

20071015 10:46:28 nbsp Howdy... I converted all the images and updated the layout a bit so people can see the pets up for adoption more clearly set out from the adopted pets.  I also dropped in some comments that are only visible when you edit the entry so that itll be a little bit easier the next time you update them.  Fantastic job  stuff like this is easy to talk about, but keeping a regularly updated resource is hard work. Users/JabberWokky

20080422 14:46:34 nbsp Windy looks like a clone of my dog.  Its kinda freakin me out.  Users/JennSuzuki
