4th year civil engineering student. Works as a spoiled engineering intern for Summers Engineering, Inc. during school breaks.  Finals make her brain tired and grumpy. Ashley Update: Isnt it supposed to be spring?

Sits most nights at desk doing pages of endless engineering homework and daydreams of snowboarding in fresh powder........... sigh

Is excited to go home again and visit the good ol 559. Wants to visit Death Valley for spring break but all her friends are wimps.

Ashley thinks these are the most shadiest things about Davis:

 1. The massive amounts of people wearing Uggs
 2. all the EPA Superfund Sites around Davis
 3. Castilian Hall dorms
 4. Richards Underpass
 5. Classes where the professor deliberatly tries to fail people
 6. Davis Police Department
 7. Athletes getting better pass times than the rest of us. Come on they already get paid to attend as it is
 8. Sword and Sandals
 9. a vast portion of ASUCD
 10. TAPS

I havent suppressed your comments today.  Ive just disagreed with you.  And to disprove a charge of libel, Saul would have to prove that he is not an fucktard.  Since I dont believe the word is defined in any dictionary, hed have a difficult task.  Delete this comment when you finish reading it, if you want. Users/BrentLaabs

Im probably more disagreeable today due to finals.  By the way, I liked your list.  I dont feel its a community list, but if its labelled thats fine.  My roommate works for TAPS and I told him about it.  He said they hate people as much as people hate them. :) Users/BrentLaabs

Brent, you use my name like you know who I am. Ashley, you seem pretty spiffy. SS

I like the word spiffy, yes you do seem spiffy, especially since we both find the DPD shady and Swords and SandalsUsers/JimSchwab

I actually meant to link it directly to the list on your page, but I dont think that anchors work across pages.  Im not calling you shady or anything. :) Users/BrentLaabs

Since you appear to live in greystone, I feel as though I should ask you a question which I have asked on the wiki before but recieved no definitive answer to.  If, hypothetically of course, someone were to walk in off the street into greystone during that saturday breakfast thing, would this person be able to feast upon the food there?  Is there any sort of checkpoint or something?  Remember, this is all hypothetically speaking of course.  Users/GeorgeLewis

  the reason why athletes get better pass times is because they have to schedual their classes around their athletic practices, which are generally around 35 hours long 5 days a week.  when all is said an done, the amount of classes they can not take because of this conflicting arangement is well more than the amount of classes you can not get into because athletes have better pass times.  also the majority of athletes do not recieve athletic scholarships and do not get units for their sport. thus this is not a shady practice.Users/mattHh
   OK, but lets give Team Aggie Spirit Engineering team Users/JeyKottalam members better pass times too. After all, pioneering Engineering work is far more relevant to the University than athletics. I think its silly to give athletes favorable treatment, especially when athletics dont really have anything to do with the primary goals of the University. Users/JeyKottalam
    Props to that! Ive been on two civil engineering design teams during my time here. We have set meetings, and competitions, so is there a reason why athletes are more important than us? NO. I put at least 30 hrs a week into Concrete Canoe last year, and it would have been nice to have some kind of early registration to get my classes set up to maximiza me time. This school isnt like Fresno State, athletics arent the only thing important, so the Registrars Office needs to recognize that all of us should have the same dogeatdog chance at fighting to get classes.
