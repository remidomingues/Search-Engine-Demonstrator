Ashleys Pet Sitting is run by Ashley, a long time animal rescuer and veterinary assistant, and David an animal lover who has grown up around animals and continues to enjoy spending time with them. Ashley has worked with rescue animals and specializes in fearful dogs and disabled dogs. Ashleys Pet Sitting can take care of anything from daily visits to feed and clean up after the family cat to caring for multiple pets in your home with Daily visits, or staying overnight.

My favorite clients are clients I adopted to in my work with the Yolo SPCA. Rescue animals are my specialty!
