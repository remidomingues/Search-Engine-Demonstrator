A great place in Downtown Davis, nicely decorated with water fountain, candy treats, drinks, two tables, and a very relaxing atmosphere. Will work around your busy schedule.  Ask for Jennifer, she would love to have you as a new customer.

Jennifer describes her technique as, I trained in Asia so I bring both the Asian and American techniques to the Massage Services massage table.  Please come for a relaxing hour.  $60/hour, worth your troubles. Give me a try today.

The sign, which can be spotted outside Starbucks, mentions a student discount of $45.

There have been Craigslist postings implying that she does Prostitution more than massage.  Users/BarbaraClowers called her and discovered that, although her English is imperfect, she does not appear to offer anything sexual, implying that the Craigslist posting was an attempt at garnering harassment.


  From therapy to pure relaxation, Davis offers a variety of Massage Services


20070525 17:25:13 nbsp Paid for an hour, got only a 50 minute massage. Never going back there again!
Also, she only takes cash, and makes you pay upfront. Users/BillyBudd

20071013 18:09:04 nbsp Sign said $46/hr for students. I went in and she said that its now $50. Had to pay upfront cash only. Massage lasted only 50 minutes and was not very strong... so I left just as tense as when I arrived. Also, as I was leaving she asked if I had a tip for her. After paying $50 for a lame 50 minute rub down, I definitely did not have a tip for her.
Not recommended. Go elsewhere. Users/Teny

20080606 04:32:32 nbsp Pretty terrible massage (4/10) and after flipping on my back, lady started rubbing my private area asking you want massagy and it all made sense..   if she didnt look like my friends 50 year old moms I would have less to complain about.  I guess it all depends on your taste, but I wouldnt pay 50 dollars for an old lady to perform that kind of service on me. Users/ucdjimjim

20090113 18:57:18 nbsp My husband bought me a $50 gift certificate last year.  I tried to use it a few months later, and they would not honor it because Jenny no longer works there.  What a waste!!!   Users/jodiane

20090426 20:47:19 nbsp April 2009. I noticed the sign was gone the other day and walked up the stairs to Suite E. This
massage parlor is no longer in business.
