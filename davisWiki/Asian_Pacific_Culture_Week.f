Asian Pacific Culture Week (APCW) was one of the SPAC Culture Days. APCW is now a program under the Cross Cultural Center.

Asian Pacific Culture Week, a weeklong series of arts, education, and entertainment events produced at UC Davis with a special focus on the Asian Pacific Islander American student population!. It is an annual event in April and is highlighted with a series of free shows.

On the CrossCultural Center Website, APCW is described as,
Since its inception in 1973, Asian Pacific Culture Week (APCW) has provided the UC Davis campus with cultural programs designed to both educate and celebrate. APCW became a University sponsored program in 1979 and has grown into an annual event anticipated by students, faculty, staff, and members of the Davis community alike. The week is filled with presentations by speakers from diverse corners of the Asian Pacific Islander community. In the past, musicians, comedians, actors, authors, artists, and civil rights activists have visited the campus to share their experiences.

Providing the climactic finale at the end of the week is Culture Night, the annual talent showcase featuring student, local, and professional groups. Combining traditional and contemporary styles, the performances reflect the changing face of Asian American culture. Past performers have included members of Mga Kapatid (MK), Na Keiki O Hawaii (Hawaiian Club), the Davis Chinese School, as well as professionals such as comedian Rex Navarrete and Last Comic Standing winner Dat Phan.
