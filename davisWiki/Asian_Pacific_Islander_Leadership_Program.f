APILR
  The Asian Pacific Islander Leadership Retreat (APILR) is where leaders and upcoming leaders join for a weekend to learn more about campus resources, other organizations and build networks. This is usually held in the beginning of the Winter Quarter.  Now under the CrossCultural Center, The Asian Pacific Islander Leadership Retreat (APILR) aims to develop student leadership within the Asian Pacific Islander community by enhancing selfawareness and personal growth. It is a fun and enriching weekend retreat that provides students the opportunity to learn about issues concerning API communities, develop a stronger bond within our communities, and gain invaluable leadership skills that last a lifetime.

Applications for students and facilitators are distributed in the fall and deadlines are at the beginning of winter.
