on businesses and the wiki:

20091109 21:55:58 nbsp It isnt just about favorable reviews. There are some editors that have come to represent a business in which they have an interest and participated in the collaborative editing process. They may be business owners, or just employees, but they have demonstrated good customer service by how they interacted with other editors who sometimes left anonymous and acerbic comments. There are also those who came here and didnt get the idea that this is a community resource and treated it like just another advertising venue that they felt entitled to control. Users/JasonAller
  And one of the reasons I mentioned Aaron was that hes not only done what you said, but hes also contributed to other pages on the wiki as a member of the Davis community.  Like many business owners, things were a little rough with his introduction to the wiki, but eventually it worked out (imo).   Users/CovertProfessor
  I think you hit the nail on the head.  I didnt have time to speak to the reporter before his deadline, so hopefully he got this.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091110 11:22:04 nbsp The Davis Wiki is not about helping (or harming!) local businesses. Its for the community. Thats everyone who lives, works, goes to school, or just visits Davis. In that way I believe it benefits all local businesses. It helps by bringing exposure, by sharing customers experences, and by simply giving hours, address/map info. that saves them having to answer the phone. We are not antibusiness by any stretch. Ive encouraged them to get involved. Users/SteveDavison
   Did somebody say that it was?
   I think I have to disagree.  By giving a soapbox to oftentimes irresponsible anonymous criticism, daviswiki could and probably does harm some local businesses.  Its not the intent and maybe we dont know how to fix it, but we should not deny it.
      I think this critique applies to almost anything on the internet.  The contextual difference is intent.  The wiki is what Steve above described.  Soapbox is difficult to judge, and I dont think anyone here really has the standing to decide who gets to contribute.  IMO, the bulk of criticisms seen tend to go along with other comments.  I think irresponsible is actually exceedingly rare.  Out of the thousands and thousands of relatively anonymous edits/critiques/comments, probably only several dozen are contentious and even less are so irresponsible as to cause an uproar and discussion.  But back to my point, the intent of this site is the difference between here and everywhere else on the internet.   Gazillions of people routinely use Yelp, Metromix, Chowhound and other reviewbased websites to discuss their love/hates.  On those sites, everybody knows that every single comment should be taken with a grain of salt.  A lot of people just ignore reviewers with a low post count.  If Im finding a place to eat at from Yelp, I care more about the guy whos left 500 reviews than I do the guy that only left 7.  The difference is, on Yelp that info is right under your username, and here it isnt: because were not meant to be simply a reviewaggregate.  This is what Steve means by were not here to help or harm businesses.  Thats not our focus.  But it absolutely is for many of these other popular websites (doesnt Yelp boast over 10 million reviews?).   The wiki is supposed to be community based, so people here tend not to like singleedit accounts.  But, again, its not abnormal at all for these other types of websites out there.  The problem we have, or not problem per se but issue we face, is that a lot of people simply see DavisWiki as another reviewbased website.  If you really hate a place, you go 1star it on yelp, and now maybe make a quick account at the wiki to hate it again.  Its getting people to crossover and be involved, and not just zoom straight in to to look up the reviews on some cafe, thats something people here have tried to work on for years.  Fundamentally, it comes down to thousands and thousands of outsiders not learning how this wiki works, because its most popular features (restaurant listings) are a local version of Yelp/Chowhound/Metromix, etc.  I think concern over harming local businesses is actually underrating the average local internetuser whos reading DavisWiki.  These people use all these other websites, they understand that soapboxing is inevitable, and just like on every other website they use, its up to them to decide how much weight to give which comments.  No single comment should ever make or break a business, no matter which website its left on.  Concern over anonymous criticism isnt unfounded at all, Im simply saying I think in context to everything else out there people use as a similar resource, I think most people are smart or experienced enough to judge the overall gist and vibe of a place as a whole, rather than at the individual comment level.   users/edwins ES

20100203 08:03:20 nbsp Can anyone tell me how I might add a hotlink that goes to a specific paragraph or comment on a page? I just know how to add a link that goes to that page but not a specific section of it. Users/DagonJones
        The wiki can utilize anchors on the same page, such as on http://daviswiki.org/UCD_Alphabet_Soup?actionedit this page.  ie, {{{Anchor(Staff)}}} in front of the appropriate paragraph, and {{{#Staff See Our Staff}}} at the top of the page for the link to it.  Not sure about crosspage linking to an anchor though. users/edwins ES
            It has to be a web link (like an outside link).  Theres no way to do a markup link to a anchor reference.  Sorry. jw

20110328 12:47:35 nbsp Im ordering new business cards, and am considering using a Google Voice number to have a local (530) phone number on them (my cell/main line is a Fresno number).  So, my question: is it unprofessional or awkward to have calls to my work number pick up with a recorded message saying, Hello! Please state your name after the tone, and Google Voice will try to reach (recording of my voice) Tom Garberson? After the caller does so, it dials through to me and states the name they gave.  This would be in addition to the cell number on the business card. Users/TomGarberson
  I just dealt with that earlier today.  I thought it was reasonable: the automated form of an assistant answering the phone. It was a little grating in terms of having to mentally shift gears when I had prepared for the call.  Also, if you can record a replacement message, Id recommend that.  Something about try to reach sounds like youre not routinely available during business hours. jw

20110429 22:09:46 nbsp Is there any place in town to get Turkish coffee?  Or any place that can powder coffee finely enough to make it at home?  Im running low :( Users/TomGarberson
     Ive heard that Turkish Coffee can occasionally be obtained at Sams on 3rd St. I do not know if this is true, but you might ask them. users/JoshLawson
      Nice, thanks Josh!
     The finest grind on the two grinders at Trader Joes is Turkish, as well as for the two identical grinders at the Davis Food Coop Users/BruceHansen

20110629 12:44:31 nbsp Anyone know which venues in town are showing Womens World Cup coverage?  Next game is 8:30am on ESPN.  Im assuming The Graduate will be open and showing it.  Anything else? Users/TomGarberson
 To partially answer my own question, The Grad will be opening around 9 to show most or all of the game.  Lamppost is open at 8 daily.  Beer Shoppe doesnt open early.  If you know about other places showing the games, you can add them to the list at World Cup! tg

20110713 23:51:37 nbsp Anyone know a band that does weddings and covers recent songs?  I am getting married in late August (in the Bay Area) and really want to have live music.  Quite a trip if the band is in Sac area, but I figured someone might have some ideas. Users/MikeIvanov

20110908 23:10:30 nbsp Is there a place in Davis to fill a 5# CO2 cannister?  I know theres an Airgas in Woodland, although I hear its closed on weekends (not ideal).  Ive heard theres a place in Sacramento thatll fill on weekends, but thats kind of a pain. Users/TomGarberson

20110910 22:05:02 nbsp Im looking for a yoga studio; primarily Im running for my cardiovascular fitness so Im not interested in anything super intense like bikram for example; Id like to find a couple classes a week that arent too packed with people and also isnt 99% female because I hate feeling out of place.

20111213 12:48:51 nbsp Anybody know a good place in the area to buy bongo drums?  Users/ScottMeehleib
 Have you checked out Watermelon Music?  They dont sell them, you might need to go to Sacramento. Users/TomGarberson

20120103 09:25:12 nbsp Does anyone know the best deal in town for a smog check?  (does NOT need to be a test only/ gold shield center)  EZ smog quoted me $55 out the door with their coupon. Users/DagonJones
 Theres a comparison of some of the places in town laid out http://daviswiki.org/Automobile_Repair?actionshow&redirectSmog#head55d32ac8323c6e2bd6d87e00ff5a633427cda982 here.  Its not exhaustive, and, as it notes just below the table, those prices dont include the $8.25 smog certificate. Users/TomGarberson

Anyone in town use Sprint or TMobile?  Im looking into finding a new carrier in the fairly near future and Sprint and TMobile have the most attractive plans on their face.  Anyone have any experience with either one?  Sprint has the added convenience of having a store in town, so Id tend to lean that way.  The two phones would be used primarily in Davis, Sacramento, and Vacaville.  Any advice would be welcome! Users/TomGarberson
also I have sprint solid reception around town my house is in the middle of two towers so I get occasional missed calls but they sent me a personal cell tower for when Im home Tmobile isnt actually a cell provider they lease from Verizon the airtime that is. In Sac and Vacaville you should be okay with either

20120727 16:10:19 nbsp Does anyone happen to know if/where you can buy moving boxes in town?  I know Navins at least used to put them out for free and whatnot, but I dont mind spending a few bucks and just getting nice solid ones.  Does ACE sell them?  Id rather not have to go to Home Depot/Lowes. Users/TomGarberson
  UHaul sells them.    cp.
  Oh yeah, I saw that earlier and already forgot about it.  Theyre like 2x the price of Home Depot ones.  Might be the way to go if theres nothing better in town, but Im hoping theres another option.  Thanks! tg
    Target might have them if ACE doesnt.  cp
    Cmon you shills think local already All Star Rents for sure and probably Hibberts as well as local self storage places usually sells boxes. Daubert

20120804 01:28:16 nbsp Is there a better tasting veggie burger than Boca Burger at any of the Davis grocery stores? I like the Boca Burger, but, after going quasivegetarian, I was wondering if its really the best. Users/ScottMeehleib
 Morningstar beats the pants off Boca IMO.  They come in the usual smallish packs in grocery stores, or you can get big packs at Costco.  I often get one of those and a pack of Costcos salmon burgers (absolutely fantastic, if youre quasipescitarian) to keep in the freezer. Users/TomGarberson

20120804 02:41:30 nbsp If youre tired of veggie burgers, try felafel! There are tons of recipes for make your own at home. Tasty alternative to veggie burgers, and packed with just as many nutrients as a boca burger. I find felafel less intimidating than tofu.  Users/MichelleKoehler

20120827 09:25:42 nbsp Does anyone know what the black body outlines are?  There is one on the greenbelt near the South Davis Softball fields and one on 8th streat near Anderson.  They are like a chalk outline from a crime scene but black paint on black asphalt.  They have been there a while, it is possible that they used to be white paint and were covered up with black paint.  Some kind of treasure hunt or maybe an art project? Users/DagonJones


20140206 19:33:14 nbsp Can I sell items on here? If so, how do I do it? Judy Users/judyclark
 This is more of a site to document Davis rather than to sell things. You might try Freecycle, Craigslist, or NextDoor.com. Users/MeggoWaffle
