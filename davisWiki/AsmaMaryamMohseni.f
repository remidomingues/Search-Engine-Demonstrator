Thanks for editing and updating some of the pages about vegan food.  A belated Welcome to the Wiki!  I saw your comment about the farmers market and some bread including honey.  I always thought that honey was a bit of a controversial thing in the vegan community; my understanding is that the majority wont touch it and I guess will shoot for agave syrup instead, but theres a sizable number of people who think honey is in the clear.  The basis being semantics of the original definition of vegan, animal vs insect product and the method of harvesting being nonharmful to the insects.  Is there some sort of food labeling standard when something is marked as vegan? For example, I know organic products carry a certain seal, and I was just curious if products with honey can still legally carry the vegan standard seal (if there is one).  Cheers, users/edwins ES

  Hi Ed, thanks for the welcome! Technically, honey is not a vegan product  insects are, after all, animals  but there are many who identify as vegan who, for various reasons, do not avoid honey. There isnt a standard for labeling vegan food, but organizations sometimes place their seal of approval on certain products. In the case of labeling a food including honey as vegan, I would refer to The Vegan Societys http://www.vegansociety.com/resources/animals/beesandhoney.aspx site (their founder, Donald Watson, coined the term). By their standards, honey is not vegan. Of course, people will label themselves as they wish.

 For what its worth, Id never seen any product with honey labeled as vegan before.  AMM

20110411 22:19:54 nbsp I went to http://www.walkjogrun.net/ and did a search for mapped runs or jogs near Drummond Lane and didnt see any going down it in my quick browse through the results. I also looked on http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat38.53202&lon121.71065&zoom16&layersM OpenStreetMap which is a user editable map. OpenStreetMap showed a portion of the road marked private, but as CovertProfessor noted... that can be claimed and is hard to verify. Users/JasonAller
  Thanks Jason! I contacted the city and am waiting to hear back. I do suspect that the road is actually private, and the guy gave me background suggesting that he was telling the truth (he mentioned that in naming the private road, his father made the mistake of naming it the same as the public road). As for the MapMyRun link, that would be the run I mapped today! Im deleting that tonight because I dont want anyone else trying the route out.  AMM

20110411 22:24:54 nbsp However: http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/31524312 MapMyRun showed a result on the first try going right down that road. Users/JasonAller

20110527 03:01:54 nbsp what kind of rabbits? Sorry I digressed! They never even gave you testing to see? That is lame at least you have other things working for you like structure etc  Users/StevenDaubert

  X Are you referring to Davis tap water and rabbit renal disease? Our little lopeared (probably Norwegian dwarf) female was the one who was reacting to it. I dont remember what exactly was elevated, but it was markers of kidney dysfunction. Weve had her (and our other four rabbits) on reverse osmosis water for close to a year and shes doing great!

Testing as in ADHD{{{ >__>}}} Daubert

  Haha, that makes more sense  I think the rabbit comment threw me off. Formal testing costs quite a bit, and I was diagnosed years ago as an undergrad without tests. Even with testing, all Id get is accommodations like extra time for exams, which I dont need. What would be really nice is if the university had specialists (or groups) focusing on life/study skills for ADDers. As for structure working for me... sometimes it works, most times its still a big struggle.  AMM
