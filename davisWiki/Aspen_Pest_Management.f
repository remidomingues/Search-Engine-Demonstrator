20080923 09:42:24 nbsp Weve used their bimonthly (every other month) service for a couple of years.  They come by and spray around the house foundations to control ants.  Works pretty well.  They will also drop off traps for mice and so forth.  I like using a local business rather than some huge corporate chain that is not responsive. Users/RalphFinch

20100422 19:13:30 nbsp These guys are GREAT for termites! They will not make a mess, use pretty ECOcool stuff and are extremely reasonable as far as pricing. Over a few years weve only needed 2 sprays  they give great suggestions for how to use the inexpensive termite stakes and not waste money. Also, they show up on time! Users/KimPruett

20101108 15:06:08 nbsp I called for an inspection and there was no charge.  The guy who came out was super helpful, he gave me lots of advice for do it yourself pest management and then even gave me some free ant traps.  Honest customer service is a great asset in a company and Aspen seems to have lots of it.  Aspen is now the only pest control company I will ever use. Users/DagonJones

20130717 14:18:35 nbsp I called for an inspection of our shed from both Terminix and Aspen. Terminix said the damage to our shed floor was from termites; however, David from Aspen told us to simply replace the floor with pressure treated lumber as the damage was from rot not termites. He then inspected the garage and found a few small termite tubules. He said he had just finished a job and it would be no problem to drill a few holes in the concrete, insert the termite poison and fill the concrete. There was no charge at all for his assistance! He was knowledgeable and provided amazing service. I highly recommend this company to anyone in Davis.  Users/ChristyannDarwent
