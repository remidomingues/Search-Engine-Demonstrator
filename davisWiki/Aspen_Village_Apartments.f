20090125 13:53:44 nbsp Ive called this place home for two years now. Aspen is a great place to live if your a balanced, nonpsychotic, nonfrat, type of person.  Its quiet, yes, but there is a reason, its by a freakin lake, and a little park, this insulates the sound.  Ive had 2030 people parties and no one complained because the probably couldnt even hear us.  The apartments themselves a have a good balance of space and design.  Its simple, but not ugly, that is a plus when half of the apartments in Davis look like they were designed by people on acid trips (for further architectural atrocities check Death Star).  The management is top notch, and you always get the feeling Sherri is trying to work with you.  The only thing you can bag on aspen about is the distance from campus, but come on, the bus is only a ten minute ride.  This is the trade off, if you want comfort you pay in distance, but gain in affordabillity (thats a word right?).  So if you want to live come to Aspen, if you want to party all the time, go to Arlington (which is just as far from campus by the way).  As for me, I live in Aspen and party wherever there is one, thus not confining myself to my little Arlington, Allegre, or Lexington world.  Users/pmaravelias

2009224  Anybody has 3bedroom apartment in West Davis and is looking for summer sublet, please let me know.  I may be able to take over your lease and renew for an extra year.  I can be reached at yzhengusc@gmail.com.

20090304 11:26:06 nbsp I lived here from 20052007 and loved it.  The management were the nicest people I have ever met, really helped me when a housemate suddenly decided to move out two days before the start of school.  I didnt get screwed with the security deposit; I thought it was very fair seeing that the apartment has been passed down for five years (many wears and tears).  Parking was great too.

20090709 00:25:29 nbsp I have lived at Aspen Village for the past 2 years and I have to say this complex is exceptional. I found this complex my freshmen year online and based on numerous positive reviews I decided to live here. The complex is clean, the apartments are spacious, and parking is plenty. Best value for the price. I lived in a 3 bedroom upstairs apartment overlooking the lake and I have to say it is the most relaxing thing coming home from a long day to a quite place and a great view. Never had a problem with ants, maybe because I had an upstairs apartment. Lastly, the management is above and beyond expectation. Sheri is the most understanding manager probably in all of Davis. Our apartment had our share of problems with coming up with rent on time, roommate issues, apartment issues ect. Sheri has always been understanding and helpful. It has never taken more than a few days for repairs to be made. Quickest maintenance I have ever seen. I dont know any other complex that puts out free donuts and coffee every weekday morning and cookies every weekday afternoon. It is a bit far from campus but the P/Q,K,D lines are literally a 23 min walk away. Campus is about a 1015 min bike ride. Highly recommended. Users/RLT

20091202 20:18:12 nbsp the absolute best thing about this place is that they give me free food when i am hungry. merrrrrrrrrrrrr Users/aamatsui

20100314 22:03:29 nbsp If Aspen had single bedroom or studio apartment, I would stay here forever!

I cannot stress how much I love this apartment complex! The management is wonderful. They are very responsive to complaints/issues, and are constantly upgrading the area (meaning new paths for convenience, new computers for residents to use, weekly landscaping to keep it looking nice, and just general niceties around the complex. on top of this, every time we have had a problem in our apartment (broken microwave, broken dishwasher, mold, light bulb changing, loose outlets, broken light switches, etc) they have gotten to it the next day, or sometimes the very same day. One time our lock got jammed on our door and they can over RIGHT when I told them and replaced the lock and keys, no questions asked. It was as if it never happened. In addition to maintenance, the management is friendly and very generous. They provide donuts and coffee Monday through Friday mornings, and cookies all day Monday through Friday.
The kitchens and living rooms are pretty roomy compared to many other complexes Ive seen, and the closets in the bedrooms are huge.
The scenery around the complex is one of the biggest draws for me. Aspen village is right next to a wildlife reserve where theres tons of water fowl, and a bike/walking path that runs all the way from Arlington Boulevard to Covell. There are tons of trees and flowers around the complex and the surrounding area, and its very calming.
Also, this is a QUIET complex. Theres no partying here (which could be good or bad I guess), and many of the residents are families or noncollege students, so everyone is fairly respectful.
Parking here is wonderful, especially if you live on the side with the 30 apartments, as not many people park on that side. Parking is free for everyone. They hand out parking passes, but they are not necessary. You may park anywhere.

The only negatives are these: no dogs allowed, a little far from campus (a few miles), and only 23 room bedrooms.

20101001 06:59:52 nbsp I loved this place. Its on the D/K/P/Q line, which is nice. Free donuts and cookies on weekdays!!! Pool is nice, not usually crowded (except a few days out of the year... like Picnic Day). Decent gym. Really quick with maintenance requests/repairs. Theyve fixed the fridge (leaking water), replaced our microwave (they also let us borrow countertop microwave while they ordered a new one to replace the one above the oven). Really friendly and helpful staff. Pretty quiet complex (unless you get annoying people living above you who seem to like to jump around as if theyre playing tag or all day). NEVER had a problem with guests parking over. I know its permit only, but theres usually still lots of parking space for residents AND guests.


I only moved out of Aspen because I wanted to bring my dog to Davis... and was tired of living with so many people so I moved into a different place thats a 1 bedroom (I lived in a 3 bedroom at Aspen). I guess the only con was that we lost most my deposit, but thats because my housemates didnt help clean, so its not like Aspen was evil about it.... It was fair, I thought. Oh wait, the other con was that our door had huge gaps and wasnt completely sealed... qhich may have contributed to our high PGE bill whenever we used the A/C. And I guess the dishwasher sucks and was totally incapable of getting rid of food particles, no matter how small (rice?!). I dunno, I heard from people that its because of Davis water, but our new complexs dishwasher works perfectly fin. So I dont know. Oh well. Users/JenniferGiang

20110405 18:31:53 nbsp Im looking for roommate(s) to replace me for the master bedroom in a threebedroom for Fall 2011. You will be living with 4 other friendly girls. The rent will be about $619 and 1, 2, or 3 people can occupy that room. If anyone is interested, please contact me at colao@ucdavis.edu Users/ConnieLao

20110714 21:23:04 nbsp I loved living here!  I lived in a 3bedroom upstairs unit for 3 years, and have great memories from the experience.  Everything in the apartment was clean and in good condition, repairs and improvements were made in a timely manner, we never had any major maintenance issues.   The location is great  its just the right distance from campus, West Davis is a great neighborhood.  Ultimately its an apartment that can really feel like home (not just a place to crash after classes).  Also the management is exceptional!  Sherri is professional, straightforward, and very helpful, and it makes a huge difference in the rental experience, especially when compared to some other complexes in Davis.  Highly recommended.  Besides theres fresh cookies in the office every afternoon. Users/MatthewCCoker

20120730 12:21:01 nbsp Aspen Village has been my home now for five years, and since Im moving out this year, I thought Id leave some thoughts on my experience.

First, the management. They have been super helpful and friendly and are always quick to respond to any issues that come up. We had an issue with our pool key, and Sheri, the manager, stopped what she was doing and spent a good 15 or 20 minutes with me until the problem was fixed. Theyre also available for most of their posted office hours, with the exception of lunch breaks (which they post on their window with a will return at clock). Another bonus is that they always put out some breakfast goodies (or snacks) in the morning for those onthego people who need a quick bite. The management here rocks!

The communal facilities are great  theres a pool by the office, a minigym in the office building, and two laundry/dryer rooms that arent that busy (aside from Sunday nights). They also provide a small grill by the pool for miniature BBQs. Everything is wellkept and clean!

Now, on to the actual apartments. The rooms are spacious and clean with huge closets! We havent had any serious bug issues in our fiveyear stay, aside from an occasional spider. But hey, over the course of five years, theres bound to be one that slips in the door when you open it  management keeps the apartments clean, and when we moved in, it was spotless. The central heating/A/C unit works great, though in one of our rooms, it definitely gets way colder than the others!

The location is great with wonderful scenery included, and I have to agree that its an incredibly quiet and relaxed environment for families or students. If you really must party, there are the occasional ones scattered about, but be sure to ask the security patrol for tips on doing so respectfully and responsibly!

All in all, Aspen Village has been an incredible accommodating and relaxing place to live, and the management makes it even better! My only worry is that theyve spoiled me on what to expect from other apartments in the future! Be sure to check this place out if youre looking for a quality place to stay! Users/JeremyHsia

     Thank you Jeremy for that glowing review! It is always great to hear that our Residents appreciate good management just as much as we appreciate great residents :) Yolo Property Management Yolo Property Management

20120830 12:47:24 nbsp I chose Aspen Village because it was the only place I remember having consistently good reviews, and I found out why. The people and the setup are all great. There are quite a few amenities and benefits to living here, and the best part is the service. The office people are always friendly and responsive, and the service crew is always around and also always really fast with getting things done. Ive never had a complaint about living here.

In short, this is a nice, quiet apartment complex with friendly staff and great benefits.  Users/DChang

20120902 15:12:25 nbsp The place is well situated near a scenic path thats great for walks or runs. The apartment complex is a short bike ride to the Westlake IGA (local super market) at Westlake Plaza, which as great food options. The staff was always friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. Sherry was great and easy to interact with (she has since moved on, but the staff is still as responsive as before). Id recommend it.  Users/DanTee
