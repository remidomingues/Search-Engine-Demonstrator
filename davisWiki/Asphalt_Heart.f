I saw these everyday on my way to work one summer a few years ago! I had wondered if anyone else knew about them. My guess is that some fellow working on the road had a girlfriend living nearby and decided to leave a message for her. Users/BarnabasTruman

Actually, a heart shape is a primitive shape. Imagine two oblongs intersecting at right angles, or a square with 1/4 removed, or the intersection of two mirror spirals. Such a wonderful shape.

But notice that the top one is distinctly, and almost certainly deliberately, formed into the pointed shape associated with a heavily stylized heart. Users/BarnabasTruman
