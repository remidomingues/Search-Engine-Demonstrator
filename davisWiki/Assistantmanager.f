How hard is it to change our user name on our account? Tracie Gonsolis, Alder Ridge Apartments. Users/Assistantmanager

20090501 16:36:20 nbsp You can not change a user name. A user name is just a log on. Its kind of like trying to change an Email address. You can close down that name and make it so no one else can use it and create a new one however. Just click settings in the top right under your user name, check Disable this account forever and click the button. Im sure you are familiar with setting up a new account ;) Users/MasonMurray
