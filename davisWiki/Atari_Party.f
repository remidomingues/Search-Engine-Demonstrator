 History 
In late 2008 Users/BillKendrick Bill Kendrick, local Atari nerd and recent exmobilevideogame developer, decided to invite friends over to enjoy some of his various Atari video game systems. Interest among his friends and acquaintances was high, and what was to be a small event in his livingroom turned into a fullfledged public event.

 Past Events 
The first event was held in March 2009 (around the time of the Game Developers Conference in the SF Bay Area). He and a handful of friends brought a dozen games systems and computers and set them up for 3 hours at the Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch Public Library in Davis. About 80100 people showed up, and that weeks The Davis Enterprise Enterprise newspaper had an article and some photos. http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/atariparty/2009/photos/ Photos from 2009

The second event took place again in March 2010 at the Redwood Park Community Building on Anderson Road. It ran 8 hours, and over 30 game systems were set up, with over 500 games. It also included two film screenings (the documentary film Once Upon Atari and Disneys classic partcomputergenerated, partliveaction, partanimated film Tron) and a free prize giveaway. Prior to the event, Sacramento News & Review SNR mentioned event and said Dont Miss It! http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/atariparty/2010/photos/ Photos from 2010

The third event took place in June 2011, again at the Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch Public Library. Two movies were screened (Once Upon Atari and Cloak and Dagger), and more prizes were given away in a drawing. Details are at http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/atariparty/2011/photos/ Photos from 2011
