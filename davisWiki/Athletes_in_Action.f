Athletes in Action, aka AIA,  is Spiritual Organizations fellowship group of Northern California Northern Californian Christian athletes and athletically minded people that meet on UC Davis campus for large group meetings, Bible studies, and fellowship events. You do not need to be an ICA athlete to attend and the group is welcome to anybody and everybody who is interested in fellowship and learning more about who Jesus is.

We are a growing movement that uses sports as a platform to help people answer questions of faith and to point them to Jesus.
We believe that sports has the power to open doors and create connections in a way that few other things can.
Ultimately, our goal is to see peoples’ lives changed as they discover God’s purpose for their life.

We strive to see Christfollowers on every team, in every sport, in every nation, but as for right now, were aiming to see people love and follow Jesus at UC Davis!
We want every athlete to know someone who truly follows Jesus and to work together toward the common goal of furthering God’s kingdom.

On a national level, Athletes in Action is a part of Cru (formerly called Campus Crusade for Christ). (from https://www.athletesinaction.org/discover/about)


For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
