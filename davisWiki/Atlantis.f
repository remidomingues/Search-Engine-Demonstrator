Atlantis was a small Video Games video game arcades arcade that existed Downtown near a competing business known as The Library. Atlantis was on G Street where Tibet Nepal is today. Had mostly older classic games. If you got a redpainted quarter from the change machine, you got ten free plays!

After it closed an auction was held there to sell the games; dont know who got them I had expected The Library to get many of them but I think they only got one or two that I can recall. It was smaller than The Library but cleaner, and many younger kids parents would allow them to go to Atlantis but not The Library since it was dirtier and had a reputation for fights breaking out there (I was once pushed aside by someone there after my friend had said something stupid.) Some preferred The Library because it had no windows and few lights; Atlantis had windows everywhere as well as ceiling lights so that caused glare on the game screens.

They actually had mostly newer (at the time) games when it opened, but around 1984 added some older games in a section called the Play All Day Room where they were set for 2 or more games per token.

A clothing store called Body Sense opened soon after Atlantis closed, and there was at least one other business there before Tibet Nepal opened. Users/AlanSmithee
