20080521 18:25:28 nbsp Definitely some of the nicest affordable housing available in Davis.
I lived in a two bedroom in the 300 building in 0607 on the second floor. The 300 and 400 buildings occasionally hear the noise from the neighboring fraternity/sorority houses, but it wasnt that bad. During the summer, second floor apartments get pretty hot, and you need to run the A/C to keep the temp down. In the 07/08 year, I lived in a first floor in the 100 building, and never had to use my A/C at all (the middle atrium portion is air conditioned, so it keeps the lower floors cool during the summer). If you live in a place facing into the buildings, your apartment will appear very cavelike (poorly lit). I like the Atriums, but any window you have facing into the complex is like 8 feet away from someone elses window (Im sure there was some awkwardness with two neighbors bedrooms that close to each other). Parking is a pain for your friends though, TAPS patrols the place on weekdays as early as 9am until 10pm, handing out $45 tickets like candy. Users/jsramahi

20100217 17:48:37 nbsp If you are planning on receiving any mail via FedEx and you are under the management of the Atriums, beware that they will do very little to inform you of, or take responsibility for, your mails arrival at their office, including timesensitive material. I have had a horrible experience with them, stay away at all costs. Users/chrisss

20100520 12:50:15 nbsp Just an FYI to everyone, the listings on the floorplans for medium and small were reversed. They are now correct (as of 52010). Users/waveform

20100709 20:29:58 nbsp The noise from the neighboring fraternity and sorority houses has steadily increased over the past several years, with the management doing little to curb it (the Atriums and the frat and sorority houses in this area share the same management staff).  You can also count on significant noise from the cheer camps that go on during the summer near the ARC, which is not something the management can change. Users/MicheleTobias

20120618 09:14:56 nbsp Parking is never an issue.  There are always lots of spots and it is super easy to get a guest parking pass for a friend.  There are also visitor parking spots.  The noise level is not an issue either, even though they are located near the frat and sorority houses.  The building has a main lobby A/C so it stays incredible cool throughout the summer since the apartment complex just runs the A/C for the lobby and it is what you open up to when you open your front door.

The windows are not close to someone elses window, they are about 50 feet away, 8 feet away is complete incorrect, jsramahi doesnt know what he/she is talking about.

I have had friends park here in the regular parking spots with no pass for 6 hours and still never get a ticket.

The management here are some of the best in Davis, and I have lived at several spots in Davis so I can tell you from experience.  If you report something as broken or needing maintenance, they will get on it extremely fast and usually have it taken care of by the same day. Users/waveform
