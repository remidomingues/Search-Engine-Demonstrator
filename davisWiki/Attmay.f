NO DISCO EP featuring DJUNYA

303 Sumatra enters the Dubstep world with a resounding boom, releasing two solid tunes on the No Disco EP, which also features a remix by DJUNYA.

On May 12th No Disco EP, a new 6 track release from 303 Sumatra will go live. This EP features the tracks Ice of Tibet, and Cantina, as well as four additional remixes from the likes of DJUNYA, Clobber, The Foot Soldiers, and The Milkman.

Each remix brings a new dimension the already deep originals. DJUNYA, Clobber, and The Foot Soldiers keep the sound on the smooth melodic tip. The Milkmans remix steps outside the borders of the original tune, showcasing his clear and evident IDM roots.

Soon to be featured on several radio shows as well as DJ Swats upcoming tour these tunes are not to be missed. This will be Insectminds third release this year and will be available at all major online music retailers, including iTunes, Beatport, and Juno.
