Thanks for making the Maximum Benefit Auctions page, its always nice when the information about a business comes from the authoritative source instead of a customer who doesnt know all about it and sometimes has bad information. What are some of the  organizations you have worked with? A picture of you in action would be nice too or you could just put up a nice wiki:WikiPedia:Portable Network Graphics png of your business card. Thanks! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080117 08:49:14 nbsp thanks,  I would love to put up some more pics.  I read up on it a little bit and it seems like I would have to dedicate a lot more time to figuring that out.  It probably is easier than I think.  As far as organizations i work with ... a lot of schools.  Many in Sac but also the Davis Waldorf school and DPNS.  Best,  Jack Users/AuctionJack
