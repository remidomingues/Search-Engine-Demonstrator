One of the Wiki Pledge Drive 2010/Events events being held for the pledge drive is a silent auction at Rominger West Winery on Thursday, September 9th, 47pm.  We will be auctioning off a variety of items there while enjoying the music of the Mike Justis band and a variety of Rominger Wests delicious wines.  If you have anything youd like to donate to be auctioned at that event, this is the place to mention it!

If you prefer not to list your donation/contact info here, you can also email Users/TomGarberson at Mailto(tmgarberson AT gmail DOT com).
