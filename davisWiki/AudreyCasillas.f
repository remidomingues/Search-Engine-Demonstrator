Im a senior at Davis, in other words this is my fifth year!  Im basically finished with a Community and Regional Development Major and a Management Econ minor.

I am originally from Southern California Los Angeles, CA; Downey to be precise. I am the youngest in my family, the last of 16 children. yeah 16! My parents are from Jalostotitlan, Mexico

Jalostotitlan is a beautiful town in the northen portion of wiki:WikiPedia:Jalisco Jalisco. I have lived in Mexico for a short time and studied at the wiki:WikiPedia:National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico National University (la universidad nacional autonoma de mexico LA UNAM). I also studied at the National University in Havanna, Cuba (Universidad Nacional de Cuba en Havanna) and the Escuela de Relaciones Norteamericanos in Cuba (School of North American Studies of Cuba). I continue to follow the news on relations between all north american countries and enjoy afrocuban and all mexican music. My education has greatly developed who I am today and encourage all students to do the same.
