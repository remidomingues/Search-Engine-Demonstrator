The Autism Awareness Association, founded in 2007, is a Student Organizations student organization at UC Davis that is dedicated to spreading knowledge about autism spectrum disorders. We are the first college student organization to promote education and awareness about autism spectrum disorders, and we accomplish this by working closely with the prestigious M.I.N.D. Institute in Sacramento and other organizations associated through the University of California, Davis and the surrounding community. Experts in the autism field often give short presentations at our general meetings to debunk some of the misconceptions of autism and other developmental disorders, such as researchers, teachers, and social workers. The Autism Awareness Association also offers connections to internships at the MIND Institute and participates in community service events, such as Volunteer Opportunities volunteering for the Special Olympics, which are just some of the opportunities for members to see how autism effects people in everyday life.
