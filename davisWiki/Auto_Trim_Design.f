Its run by Laine Hall, he has been in that location for 25+ years. You would be very hard pressed to find someone who stands as firmly behind their work & shoots as straight as he does. The positive fawning reviews he has accrued on the Davis Wiki place him firmly in the upper echelon of all business reviewed & in this aspect ATD is rivaled only by the Poot & Scoot Plumbing and Drain Cleaning king of good service.



20070323 01:38:28 nbsp Laine is a great guy, easily the smoothest transaction Ive dealt with at an auto shop. I visited Auto Trim to get a tint job, the price was more than I expected but the 3M materials used and the 3M lifetime warranty are simply the best in the business. On top of the quality product used Laine takes pride in his work, and was precise to say the least. 100% perfect tint job, I left impressed and I will definitely go back to Laine if another tint job comes up.

20070923 19:56:25 nbsp More expensive than quoted and elsewhere but he did an excellent job. Highly recommended. Users/HaiYu

20071126 21:41:19 nbsp Laine is a really friendly and helpful guy. I didnt get my windows tinted here, but he gave me an honest answer about him not tinting the front windows any darker then the legal limit and told me about a couple places that would. Most people wouldnt have told me other shops while he did. If I didnt want my front windows tinted, I would have definitely done it here. Users/DonaldJaye

20080501 11:48:44 nbsp I just got the windows on my G35 done, and Laine did an excellent job.  The tint looks fantastic.  Highly recommended.  He was very friendly and helpful from start to finish.  Additionally the 3M lifetime warranty is something to seriously consider, if the tint bubbles or changes color, the company will pay him to replace it for you.  I will definitely recommend Laine to my friends. Users/CarDogg13

20080916 14:57:37 nbsp I had the back window and two rear side windows tinted; the two front side windows UVtinted (nearly clear); a dark tint applied to the top of the windshield; accordian sunshade attached; and the paint protection applied.  Laine did an outstanding job and it all looks fantastic.  Im going to have another car done with the windshield top tint, two front side windows UV clear tint, and the accordion sun shade (rear windows already tinted from factory).  I highly recommend this business. Users/RalphFinch

20090623 12:58:58 nbsp Laine is extremely nice and always helpful. I originally had one rolldown window retinted after my truck got broken into and it was very cheap, and he worked a deal with me to get some older film put on that would better match my older tint. The price and service were very impressive. Since then Ive recommended 4 other people to him who all got their tint done there and LOVE it. My girlfriends mom drove all the way from Stockton to have him do her tint.

Highly recommended. Ill keep coming to him after I graduate and leave Davis. Users/ChrisC

20110309 02:09:33 nbsp Not only is this the only tinting shop in Davis, I believe its one of the best around. While I didnt get tinting put on, I did get an incredibly bubbled/old tinting job on the rear windshield removed that was making it impossible to see out the back, and Laine did a terrific job. The job was completed quickly, and the workmanship is impeccable. My car has defroster lines, and they were entirely intact and functional when he was finished, which is impressive considering the condition the tint was in. Laine runs and operates the store by himself, sells a wide range of high quality 3M tint that comes with a lifetime warranty, and is incredibly friendly and personable. I had attempted to remove the tint myself first and gave him a call to ask for a quote and some advice. He stayed on the phone with me and gave helpful and professional advice on how exactly I could do that, pretty rare for someone who makes his living doing just that. In the end, it was way too difficult for me, but I was more than happy to fork over a very reasonable amount of dough to have Laine work his magic. Highly recommended!  Users/IanBurau

20110602 09:07:26 nbsp I cant remember the last time that I experienced costumer service like I got from Laine. I went in to get a quote for a tint job on my jetta and to be honest it was about 30 bucks more expensive than the quote I got from a shop in Sonoma county but after talking to Laine and comparing the shops I noticed that Laine planned on spending all day on my car vs. the other guys who said it would take them two hours. I couldnt be happier with the job that Laine did. The quality of the install was top notch, my interactions with Laine were smooth and very personable, and you cant beat the 3M material with its lifetime warranty. It should also be noted that Laine has been installing tint in Davis for over 15 years and stands behind his work. two thumbs up. Users/EMTCarter

20110610 11:35:17 nbsp I highly recommend Laines paint sealant job if youre too lazy to wax your car or even wash it regularly. Laine is the friendliest nicest guy and was the cheapest I could find in the Davis/Sacramento area. He explained everything about the product he uses and the benefits of doing this for your car, did the job in 3.5 hours, and it looks fantastic! Afterwards he showed me every scratch he was able to seal and get rid of as well as the bits he was unable to seal due to weather damage, what to look for when its time for a new sealant job, and explained what the next steps are right now. He apparently is contracted by some of the dealerships around Davis to do the same paint sealant jobs but for up to 5x the price by the dealership.  Users/ymdean

20110918 13:08:36 nbsp Laine is a wonderful guy, so personable and kind. I needed to have my rear window tint peeled and redone because it was bubbling badly. He gave me a quote over the phone for removing and retinting, then offered to have me come in and hell teach me how to take the tint off if I wanted to give it a try to try to save me some money. NO ONE does things like that these days. He really cares about his customer, not just getting money in his pocket. It turned out it was reallllyyyyy hard to take my tint off myself, so I gladly paid him the extra to do it for me. I picked up my car in the afternoon and loved it. He did an excellent job, plus you cant beat a lifetime warranty. I have NEVER had such great customer service from any one, in any service field, in my entire life.   Users/bjgerke

20120227 17:00:15 nbsp I received a fix it ticket for illegal tint so I called Auto Trim Design.  Laine was incredibly friendly and was able to fit me in within thirty minutes of my call.  The work was performed quickly and it seems to have been done very well (I dont know anything about tint but it looks good.) The price was extremely reasonable.  He also gave me advice about how to proceed regarding getting my ticket resolved.  Definitely recommend!! Users/LoriOrf

20120404 13:39:44 nbsp I tried to tint my car windows myself, which was a big mistake.  Its hard work and requires a lot of skill.  I was fortunate to find Laine.  He is super friendly, offers great advice, and does outstanding work.  He worked around my schedule and was able to remove the old tint and replace it with a beautiful new tint job on all four side windows and rear window.  He did a fantastic job, and I highly recommend. I opted to go with the more expensive 3M tint with the lifetime color guard warranty versus the standard three year tint. Users/AlH

20120426 14:25:15 nbsp I went to Laine for a tint job on my car and he did such a fantastic job. Laine has excellent customer service, explained everything, showed me on his own vehicle what I would be purchasing and did any excellent job and offered a great warranty. He is so personable and nice, he even gave me a ride to work so I didnt have to walk. Cant say enough good things about my experience with Laine and what a great job he did. Highly recommend him to anyone looking for quality customer service and attention to detail. I am impressed and will go to him for all future jobs. Users/KristynFresz

20120925 13:46:40 nbsp I have to agree with all of the reviews here about Laine.  He has the best customer service and is such a great person to work with.  He was extremely accommodating in helping me decide what color tint to get: he took me outside to compare how they each felt/looked in the sun and held it up against my back window as I sat in my car to get an idea of how much visibility I had.  Im very happy with the overall product and highly recommend Laine. Users/jessik

Laine is not the cheapest, go to Woodland if you want that. He has been in the same location for 24 years now, and uses superior materials coupled with unparalleled workmanship. I would highly recommend Laine if you want your tint done right the first time. He is also very jovial. He doesnt do fabrication of trim Daubert

20130416 10:36:15 nbsp Laine has done a number of cars for me, he is by far the best in the area, highly recommend.  Jamie Users/JamesMorton

20130602 23:07:12 nbsp I have had eight cars tinted at four different places. The last four were tinted by Laine, and I wont go anywhere else. Before I knew Laine existed, I drove all the way into Sac thinking I was doing the right thing. Ug. No. 20somethings might be more limber and faster with a blade, but they sure dont care about the finished product nearly as much as Laine does. Laine is honest, does outstanding work, and uses the best products. Hes the real deal, and hes right here handy in Davis! Users/DarellDickey

20140702 13:04:31 nbsp Laine has done a fantastic job on both of my cars, the most recent being my little mini cooper.  The results were fantastic, and his customer service is top notch, well worth the price.  There was one small part of the job that I wasnt 100% satisfied with, and he redid that section quickly and at no extra cost.  Thanks Laine for a job well done, I wont hesitate to recommend you to any of my friends! Users/ErikHenricson
