Automobile Repair can be a fact of life for most of us in California, like death and taxes. And looking for a qualified mechanic can be like searching for a new Dentists dentist  you want a recommendation before you go under the knife and shell out big bucks. If youve had an exceptional service or consistent experience with a business in town, help the rest of us as well as that great mechanic you trust with your car and your life: add your experience to the business page.

If youre not looking for a mechanic or maybe you want something for your car other than repair, the Auto Parts section may have what youre looking for.

Please note that while many repair facilities may specialize in a specific service, such as tires, they often also provide general automotive repair and are listed in both sections. However, since most auto repair shops can and will provide oil changes, only those shops primarily providing tuneups and oil change service are listed under that specialty.

 Oil Change/Tune Up 
Most mechanics and auto shops will do oil changes and tune ups, but there are a few places in Davis that specialize in these services.  Many motorists change their own oil.  The conventional wisdom is that an oil change every 3,000 miles is a good idea, but in recent years auto manufacturers have been increasing the recommended interval.  In fact, the California Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery recently began a campaign (http://autos.yahoo.com/news/drivinggreenmeansnotchangingyouroiluntilyouneedto.html link) trying to get consumers to wait the full recommended interval before getting an oil change.  Californians would save roughly 10,000,000 gallons of engine oil per year by waiting.

 Smog Check 

Most California vehicle owners must get their cars smog checked every two years.  However, there are exempt vehicles: http://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/smogfaq.htm link. Most cars can be checked at places that both test and repair cars. There are also http://www.smogcheck.ca.gov/StdPage.asp?Body/geninfo/factsheets/Test_Only_Directed_Vehiclesaug_2003.htm testonly stations, which are government sanctioned to check smog, but are unable to give any advice or perform repairs. Any car can be tested at a testonly station; if you are paranoid and think your test station might be trying to get some repairs from you, you can go to a testonly station even if not required.  However, testonly stations tend to be more expensive than test and repair stations. Some offer a free retest.

If you fail your smog test, the repairs can be pricey. The http://www.smogcheck.ca.gov/80_BARResources/01_CAP&GoldShield/Factsheets/Consumer_Assist_FAQs.html Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) can subsidize your repairs for up to $500 if you have low income. CAP also applies to the ~2% of randomly chosen people who are required by the DMV to go to a TestOnly station. If you have expired registration, you need a NoFee Special Moving Permit, described in the http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/reg_hdbk_pdf/ch25.pdf Handbook of Registration Procedures. After failing a smog check, submit a CAP application and wait about two weeks to hear back from them or for same day service, completed applications can be delivered to:
http://www.smogcheck.ca.gov/ Bureau of Automotive Repair
Consumer Assistance Program
10240 Systems Parkway
Sacramento, CA  95827

It usually takes about 30 minutes to receive your approval letter.  To drive to their office, take highway 50 east.  Exit south on Bradsahw Road (Exit 13).  Turn left on Old Placerville Road.  Turn left on Systems Parkway and their office is on the left.  It is about 25 miles from Davis.
If approved, you can only use your CAP subsidy at a http://www.autorepair.ca.gov/80_BARResources/01_CAP&GoldShield/GoldShield_Stations.html Gold Shield Station.
A useful tip that might make the difference between passing and failing is to take your car for a twenty minute drive to warm up the engine enough for the catalytic converter to function effectively.

EDIT 5/31/11
The CAP program is discontinued. However, there is a new program called Vrrrm (see http://www.vrrrm.org/). The program aims to reduce car emissions and will pay up to $800 for approved emissionsrelated diagnostics and repairs. I failed a smog check at Advanced Auto Repair and Towing in South Davis (The only Gold Shield Station in town) and a helpful worker explained the program to me. The criteria is easy to meet if you bought gas in California between 1995 and 2005, as no financial information is required. Approval is mostly dependent on the registration status of the car in California. Advanced Auto Repair is the only shop in Davis that is able to uphold this program. If your car fails the smog and you qualify for Vrrrm, the savings on repairs can literally be hundreds of dollars.

Woodland generally has cheaper prices than Davis in this category;  In both cities, coupons are widespread and provide noticeable cost savings.  Many can be found in the Consumers Guide.  One of the shops (Yolo Smog?) has bogus ads.

 Some of these businesses also provide general automotive repair (not testonly stations, by definition), and are listed in that section as well.

  Advanced Auto Repair & Towing (Gold Shield Station â€“ Consumer Assistance Program  Test & Repair  Test Only)
  Aggie Smog (TestOnly Station)  Free retest.
  B & V Smog (TestOnly station)  They can certify all vehicles.

Price comparison for cars as of 05/05/2009:



Note: These prices do not include the $8.25 for the smog certificate, which youll need if your car passes.  Also, some places charge more for older (pre1995) cars.
Updates (March 2013): Advanced Auto Repair & Towing pricing still valid.  Coupon only works for cars >1995. Davis Auto Care & Fleet Service Center has no smog checks but will begin April 1, 2013 (hopefully not a joke). Pricing TBD.  (Jan 2014) The Davis Shell garage is no longer open.
