20090505 15:00:31 nbsp I shared with 2 other people (3 total) in the largest room and we fit very comfortably. Wasnt cramped at all! It was $295/person in that room so I didnt think it was too expensive, however if you look at the bigger picture you can probably find somewhere cheaper.

On the other hand, it IS expensive for a reason. The complex is really beautiful and the maintenance is GREAT. They attend VERY prompt when you have problems and the yard work is very well taken care of.

I did however run into numerous problems while living here though..
The smoke alarms are INSANE! They go off even when were not even cooking in the kitchen! We called maintenance to fix the problem, but they told us that thats how their smoke alarms are and that theyre just sensitive to the gas thats on the stove. Sometimes the smoke alarm would even go off in the middle of the night.

One of our toilets didnt flush very well so maintenance had to come and fix our toilet at LEAST 20 times Im not even exaggerating. It kept on clogging up. One time they told us not to throw anything in there not even toilet paper.

In the beginning of the year we had a cockroach problem, but after a few traps they went away.

Other than these 3 major problems, I enjoyed living here. Users/Joe21

20100331 00:20:53 nbsp This place is overpriced and cheaply built on the inside. Also, they will hit you hard for the security deposit. Trust me, I know from experience, do not live here. Users/tneeley

          Avalon may not be inexpensive but interior finishes are certainly not cheap. The cabinets, for one example, are each custom made and have
          upgraded laminate doors.

          I am sorry you feel the security deposit process hit you hard. You do not give enough information for me to specifically comment on your concerns
          but mistakes do happen so, please, contact me at sorrentoapartments@gmail.com and I will review the charges and credits and discuss them with you.

20100912 03:35:48 nbsp i moved into Avalon recently for fall. The environment and exterior is really nice and its really green. However, I find the interior to be little bit disappointing for the price we pay. it seems to be little outdated now. I lived in The Drake in the summer and the interior there feels new and clean. Here at avalon i can see stains on the blinds and in the kitchen. however the paint is new. In addition, I find the units to be really not soundproof, I can hear people talking across another unit at night. Maybe its just the beginning of the year, but the repair and maintenance is really slow, like it has been a week now. I find there to be lots of bugs everywhere coming in or around the house. and there is some strange scent present in the house that seems to be related to the trees and grass around the unit, maybe the AC intake? It does have the nicest environment and the pool seems to be one of the best among all apartments.  Users/MatthewLaw

20100912 03:44:12 nbsp oh and Baker from the office is really nice even though the response is slow for maintenance. It would really be nice if the apartment have security patrol like other apartment complexs because avalon at night seems to be empty and especially after the recent community center robbery where several people were held at gun point.  Users/MatthewLaw



           Thank you for the positive comments especially about the office staff. I do not know which house you are in so please give me a call or email and I will come over with maintenance staff because we want it new and clean without delay just like you do.

           Regarding noise, you have at most one common wall and it is built to a STC rating of 50 (very quiet) so I would like to learn more about the problem when I come over with maintenance.

           Thank you for your security comments. We are constantly looking to improve security. Last year we hosted a Crime Prevention Workshop with the Davis Police. They explained that the crime statistics for the area were low and that the best crime prevention is neighbors paying attention. We are scheduling another Workshop this Fall and will explore your suggestion.

           Finally on bugs. Bugs are just part of the environment in Davis, but if any of your screens are off let me know so I can get those fixed immediately. We also have weekly pest control service and we will treat specific areas of your apartment if you show me the problem.

           Thanks again for your comment and suggestions we are always trying to improve. Please contact me.

20110124 12:37:42 nbsp these apartments are fancy but expensive...  Users/tneeley

20110131 19:57:32 nbsp How much is the rent for a 3 bedroom unit? 4 bedroom unit? Users/btorres

20110812 19:57:38 nbsp I live in avalon, the thing that pisses me off about avalon is the slowwww bug service. I called about 5 times before about cochroaches in my room and they told me theyd come spray on friday, but they kept on forgetting. Even I forgot about the problem until today when I switched on the light and saw a big roach scrurry under my backpack. The funny thing is i was listening to papa roach at the same time. The great thing about avalon is the maintenence man, I dont know his name but hes great and fast. So advice is dont live on the first floor cuz too many bugs. Users/mikic0

 Mikic0, I am terribly sorry for the slow response. If you are still a tenant with us, please send me an email at sorrentoapartments@gmail.com and I will get in contact with you about the problem. We recently switched services so that may have been a factor in the issues, but regardless of the reasons, Im sorry youve had to wait so long for a response. Thomas, Community Manager
