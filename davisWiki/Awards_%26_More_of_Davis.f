20091210 15:21:48 nbsp stopped by yesterday to see if they could fix my fave watch... the owner(?) tried and tried but unfortunately it was a lost cause. He was really nice and worked on it right away though, so i would definitely go back... especially because he didnt charge me anything for his time. Users/AdrienneW

20100131 19:40:55 nbsp Went here for the first time the other week. The person helping me was extremely professional and helpful. He fixed my watch in quite a timely manner and the fee was more than reasonable! I will definitely go here for all my watch needs from now on; best in town. Users/BeanMarine

20101011 18:19:29 nbsp I have to agree with all the positive comments posted here.  I brought a recently purchased antique locket (my something old) to wear on my wedding day to see about getting our wedding date engraved on the back.  The clerk helped me pick a font and even figured out how to get our names included to make it even more personal and special.  However, the best part came when I got the estimate; it was higher than Id hoped or budgeted, especially since Id had a flat tire on the way in and hadnt factored the cost of two new tires into the wedding budget.  He saw my face fall and very graciously worked out a plan to bring the work back into my budget.  How is that for incredible service?  I cant wait to wear the locket on the big day and the engraving will make it a lovely piece to pass down to future children and grandchildren!  Thank you Davis Awards and Watchworks, this is exactly the type of store which makes me love Davis!! Users/dandysgirl

20120529 11:27:42 nbsp Disappointed. Came here today to get a watch battery replaced but it was not open at 10am like the sign says. Waited 20 minutes, along with another guy, then left. Will go somewhere else. Users/jsbmeb

20120601 14:46:17 nbsp I went here to get the battery changed for two watches. He finished both watches in less than 5 minutes and it cost 19 dollars even. Users/briankwan

20121011 16:20:10 nbsp AWESOME SERVICE. I went in to get a watch battery replaced, and Andrew dropped what he was doing to take care of it for me as fast as possible. Will definitely be going back for any watchrelated needs. Thanks so much! Users/BigJay

20130601 11:03:39 nbsp BEWARE: Sometimes local is not the best option. My wife ordered trophies 6 weeks in advance for our sons tee ball team. The week before the team party, the owner (Andrew Rathbone) claimed the trophies were ready, but they needed some finishing touches. He asked that we come in on Saturday morning at 10:15 a.m. to pick up the order. On Saturday we found a handwritten sign on the shop door that indicated the store was closed till 1:00 p.m. The team party was at 11:00 a.m.

Thank you Andrew!

20130801 18:13:09 nbsp I just went this place to remove one link from my watchs metal band (which is a 30 second procedur in inexperienced hands) and the guy charged me 7 dollars for that(which should be normally 12 dollars). I should have asked from the beginning for price. In my country(Turkey) most of the watch repair shops dont charge anything from you for this, if you insist take 12 liras. Links are attached to each other with just regular pins and anyobody having a packing needle can remove a few links. So i recommend NOT to go this place even to check the prices.

20130930 12:00:28 nbsp Brought in a watch with a nonstandard sized casing; although they had to keep the watch for a while to figure out how to safely open the back to replace the battery, they still only charged me the standard $9.50. Thanks! Users/JenWalker
