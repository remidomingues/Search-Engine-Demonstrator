Axiom Photo Design is a design studio that does photography, videography, website design and illustration work.

In March 2008, they will be moving to their newly built studio on 7th Street, on the corner of G Street.   They were originally located in a warehouse on Olive Drive, then on 1st Street 1st and A Street A, and finally their current location on 4th Street.


   Davis has a wide variety of resources for Photography

20100408 22:42:01 nbsp Yes they did.  Neil built a nice studio attachment on his house during his long overdue remodel at the G Street location.  603 Fourth Street has been vacant since Neil (Axiom), myself (APEX Cycles), Bishop (Glass Artist), and Pachamama Coffee Cooperative moved out back in early 2008.
