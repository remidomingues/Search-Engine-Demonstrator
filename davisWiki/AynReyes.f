20080315 18:46:08 nbsp AYN!  OMG, its YOU!  Youre on Davis Wiki!  That is Schweet!  No, its Ayntabulous!  How the hell did you manage to climb up onto the dominos?  You are O.G.!  Can you guess who this is?  Hint:  We work together, but never ever see each other.     Users/CurlyGirl26

20080324 19:33:45 nbsp You figured me out.  Thanks for dropping me a line!  Im a HUGE Loveline fan, but I prefer the Carolla/Pinsky era.  Although, Im not a huge fan of Stryker (hes just not the AceMan) I still try and tune in because I support what Dr. Drew is doing for callers.  At least I can listen to Adam in the mornings (and I do).  Mahalo! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080330 13:24:12 nbsp Go see Adam Carollas new movie, The Hammer.  Hes so funny.  So Adam.  I was worried that it wasnt going to be that good because Adam does better without a script.  Hes real and funny and I thought that a movie might take something away, but no, it was better than I had hoped.  Im so going to buy, like, three copies of the DVD when it comes out.  Yea, it is THAT good.  In the movie the AceMan hooks up with a defense attorney and I just kept thinking, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME!  WHHHHHYYYYYYY!   Oh the injustice of it all. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080401 16:25:02 nbsp Damn skippy it will be me!  On Friday, I was almost going to skip class and drive to Pasadena and meet him (he was out promoting the film).   Users/CurlyGirl26
