What are some of the properties that are managed in town? Users/StevenDaubert

20110121 23:00:50 nbsp The actual adresses of the properties managed in town are not listed when occupied.  Youll find them on various housing sites, magazines, and craigslist when they become available.  Obviously, the company and their clients, value their tenants, and do not want them disturbed.  Azari P. M.s clients are homeowners looking to get their time of day back and no longer worry about their properties.  Reviews can be found all over the internet, and wiki savvy folks will have no problem locating them.  With so much negativity surrounding property management companies in the area, its nice to see positive customer feedback on our end.  I am the Sacramento Areas leasing agent, and long time student/resident of Davis, CA.  This wiki page is meant to be informative, not an advertisement.  Public, as always, is free to do their research.  We would like them to know we are here should they want/need us.  And Ill let Manzar know the music on the site is annoying. :) Users/JamesGallerani
