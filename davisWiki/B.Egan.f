My name is Bobby Egan.  I graduated from UCD in December 08 with a B.S. in Managerial Economics and started a M.S. Accountancy program at Sac State immediately after in January 09.

I have lived in Davis since Fall 04 when I first arrived at the University.  I currently work for the University while pursuing a career in public accounting.

While at UCD, I enjoyed spending most of my time outside of class with the California Aggie Marching Banduh!  Being a part of the banduh was one of the most rewarding and special experiences I could ever ask for.

I love the Davis community and finally broke down and registered on the wiki page after being an avid reader for years.  I know Im boring, but I figured Id create a page for myself anyway.

Cheers!
