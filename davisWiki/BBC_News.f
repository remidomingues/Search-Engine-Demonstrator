 The BBC USA vs. BBC UK 
 
BBC in the United States is different from BBC in the United Kingdom.  In the UK, the BBC has a variety of channels on television and radio offering general interest and educational programming.  BBC Radio networks offer everything from music and breakfast morning programs to news and current events.  BBC also offers a channels dedicated to British Parliament, called BBC Parliament (Americans have something similar, called http://cspan.org CSPAN, another channel university students enjoy).  The BBC faces stiff competition from http://sky.com British SKY Broadcasting, a satellite television service which runs its own channels and is owned by Rupert Murdoch of NewsCorp.  In the United Kingdom, the BBC is funded by a television licence imposed on Britons.  This keeps many BBC channels commercialfree.  There are two channels run by the BBC that are not available in the UK:  BBC Prime and BBC World Service.  BBC Prime is a collection of BBC programming available throughout Europe, and BBC World Service is the world version of the UKs BBC 24.

In the United States, the BBC is found on cable and satellite services.  http://bbcamerica.com BBC America is a popular  channel on pay television services and is run by both the BBC and the Discovery Channel.  BBC World Service can be found on CBAND satellite, but is not yet available on any cable or major satellite services.  BBC World News, the BBC bulletin news program on the BBC World Service, is occasionally shown on local PBS affiliates via terrestrial television.  This varies by PBS station, though.  Some PBS stations also carry a variety of BBC original comedies.
