Bulletin Board Systems, or BBSes were (and in a limited sense, still are) a way in which people with Computer and Internet computers could communicate, usually locally, using a modem.  They did not use the internet, but rather a direct modem connection, which allowed for a wide variety of (almost always) text based interfaces.  They were popular in the 80s, and lingered in the 90s as the internet slowly took over their functions.  During the transition in Davis, the Dixon BBS Internet gateway was used to access various Davis related internet tools, including usenet.

There are no BBSes still active in Davis, but there were.  Here are some historic listings.  Note that the original area codes area code 916 is listed, as most Davis BBSes preceded the split of the 916 area code and expansion of the 530 area code.



You could get some awesome games off the bulletin boards back in the day. Yay for shareware
