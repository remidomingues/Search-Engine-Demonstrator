This is the license you need in order to keep Black Bear Diner bears in Davis (Philip?). Or something like that? The greatest threat to America? No?

BEAR stands for the http://www.bear.ca.gov/ Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair. Theyre the California state cows bureaucracy that XextortsX collects license fees from people who repair appliances and electronics professionally in the State of California. Electronics installers who work in cars also need to be licensed by BEAR in order to be legal. Unlike a state contractors license, a BEAR license requires Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion no demonstrated proficiency and no bond. Anyone can pay the $160 fee and get their license after filling out a form. It seems the biggest penalty for performing work without the appropriate license is a nominal fine for not asking the Nobility for permission.

Computer repair businesses need these licenses, but it seems that few do, mostly out of ignorance of the law.  Note that a license is only required for consumer repairs.  Users/JimStewart had a nice chat with the lady at BEAR and asked if he needed a license since his company repairs its own products, both in and out of warranty.  She said a license is not needed for industrial or commercial work.

 Im confused by what is considered commercial work. Would an IT consultant making a housecall to a corporate customer qualify? How about as part of a maintenance contract? wl
  The context of my discussion was repairing hardware.  Im not sure that an IT consultant configuring a network or installing an application would ever need a license.  Best to talk to them, Im not a lawyer.  Users/JimStewart

20091030 22:04:51 nbsp Must the BEAR license be publicly displayed (a bare BEAR license)?  Must it be put up with by other licenses (bear BEAR license)? Can you take it for a headache (a Bayer BEAR license)?   Users/IDoNotExist
