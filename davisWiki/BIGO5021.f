20100302 17:10:40 nbsp Are you aware that people can immediately see when you remove comments on Big O Tires? Are you also aware that your edits can be undone with two clicks of a mouse?

If there are problems with the comments on that page, please describe them on {{{Big O Tires/Talk}}}. The legitimate issues with the content youre removing, if they exist, are not immediately apparent. Because they are not apparent, your edits look unjustified and will be undone almost immediately. Right now, it looks like youre just deleting things you dont like. Not discussing your edits will get you nowhere and just waste your time and that of other editors on here. Users/WilliamLewis

20100302 17:49:52 nbsp Please take some time to learn about what the wiki is and is not. This is a community resource that has been built by many people engaging in collaborative editing. The most important thing to learn about collaborative editing in this instance is that you need to respect the contributions of other editors.
Then please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Organizational accounts pose several problems, but the core issue is that they detract from a sense of community when one or more people use the name of an organization. This leads to a sense of faceless, impersonal action rather than the actions and statements of a member of the community. As a member of the Davis community, your contributions are very much appreciated, but it would be better if you make them using your name rather then the name of your organization. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions please do so. Users/JasonAller

20100303 08:31:13 nbsp The comments that I am deleting appeer to be slander and are not true Users/BIGO5021
  Then you should consider responding to them and explaining why the comments are not true. Just deleting comments while ignoring other editors for an entire day is a great way to bring your business negative publicity. Users/hankim

20100303 08:32:52 nbsp You need to look up the definition of Slander. Then you need to understand what the wiki is. Users/JasonAller

20100303 08:39:51 nbsp 1 : the utterance of false charges or misrepresentations which defame and damage anothers reputation
 That is what most of these comments made are. Please fix Users/BIGO5021
   Actually, slander is speech (thus utterances), and these are written.  So, youre thinking of libel, which has to be knowingly false.  These arent, according to the people who wrote them. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845
   20100303 08:58:06 nbsp There are two sides to every story.  Im more than certain you may have yours.  Im sure calling all the authors of the comments lying is insulting the authors and is damaging to their reputation.  You could greatly improve your reputation by showing your side of the story and let the readers decide who is telling the truth based on the two sides presented.  My favorite example to point out is the negative reviews and responses on the B&L Bike Shop page.  Im sure the owners of that shop were just as frustrated as you are being seeing only one side of the story presented, but rather than vandalising the wiki and removing other peoples work they responded explaining their side.  That, to me, shows significant more professionalism. Users/WesHardaker
