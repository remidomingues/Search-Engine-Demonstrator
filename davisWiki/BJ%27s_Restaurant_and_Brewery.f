A restaurant and brewery, BJs is known for their brew, their Chicago style pizza, and their dessert. Their Pizookie dessert is infamous  freshly baked cookie in the pan topped with a couple scoops of ice cream.  They brew a large varieties of beer, and root beer too.  The food portions are are very large for the price.  Its very crowded, and theres usually a pretty long wait, so plan to get there early and put your name down (or go sit near the bar). The bar area is large, and features a giant tv split into 4 screens, and a couple normal tvs.  Each one usually shows a different ESPN channel, and one is usually on the news.  Their special drinks menu features a lot of unique concoctions, and credits the inventor/submitter by naming them and their hometown.

Happy hours are MF 37pm, and SundayThurs 10pm12.  Happy hour specials: $2 off appetizers, $1 off of welldrinks, $1 off of BJs Pints, and 1/2 price minipizzas.

20060306 22:13:55 nbsp Has anyone tried the pizza here?  I was excited to see a Chicagostyle pizza place open up near town; is it anywhere close to Zacharys Pizza Zacharys in quality? Users/KevinChin

20060306 23:17:01 nbsp This place is awesome!!  The Pizookie is delicious!  The drinks are pretty nice too.  This chain just opened a bunch of Norcal locations around the same time. I had the pizza in a bay area location; but Ive never been to Zacharys.  Users/EdWins ES

20060325 17:57:31 nbsp my manager went on and on about this place and told me i had to eat there. so eat there i will, and get a good photo for this wee little page. Users/MichelleAccurso

20060326 14:32:58 nbsp Ive been to the one in Westwood (UCLA area) and the food was quality.  Like most SoCal restaurant chains the portions were unnecessarily huge, but if Im going to eat a meatball sandwich I want to be stuffed anyway.  Theyre famous for their pizookie (a deep dish chocolate chip cookie served piping hot with vanilla ice cream on top) and I recommend trying it.  Just make sure that even with the big portions you leave room for dessert. Users/JillWeinstein

20060504 20:18:37 nbsp Its not just near Zacharys in quality...it far surpasses any restaurant that has ever been located on the planet Earth.  And Im not just saying that because I work there. Users/JamesWilk

20060604 17:43:02 nbsp OK, they serve Pan Pizza.  It has a thick buttery crust, which eliminates if form chicago style immediately.  But it tastes like a Pizza Hut Pan Pizza.  Its good pizza, and it may be Chicago Inspired, but... its not Chicago Style any more than the local Pizza Hut equivalent. I will go there again to try the other menu items, and for the large portions, the prices for entrees seems to run in the 1215 dollar range, so its a pretty good value, if you box up half and eat it for a later meal. Users/RogerClark
 I see from your page that you lived a good portion of your life in Chicago. Which must automatically give you authority on judging what is and what isnt ChicagoStyle correct? Pardon my childish ignorance and arrogance, but I believe that its not your Chicago Style pizza. Its not the thing you crave that you remember from your childhood memories. For the rest of us, its as close as were going to get to deep dish, ChicagoStyle pizza. The bottom line is its really good. Users/TusharRawat

20061002 02:04:51 nbsp this place is soooo goood. i get so full when i eat there Users/MichelleAccurso

20070414 19:28:40 nbsp BJs pizza is not Chicago style pizza. BJs pizza is more like pan pizza or pizza with fluffy dough and buttery crust. If any of you tried pizza from pizzeria Uno you can see and taste the difference. Ill come back here to try the other food. I forgot to mention their root beer is awesome.  Users/SimonFung

20070415 21:11:59 nbsp I went to the BJs in Natomas last week and had the appetizer sausage/basil pizza and a glass of their blonde.  The beer was surprisingly mediocre for a brewpub blonde, and the pizza was flat out horrid (all I could taste was butter and grease).  I would have been embarrassed to serve a pizza that bad.  I hope their nonappetizer pizza is better (I suspect it is) but I wont be going back to try it anytime soon.  That said, their pizookie was VERY good and I can see why its popular.  But overall, between the mediocre beer, bad pizza, and ambience that was so loud I couldnt hear anybody who was nonadjacent to me, Im not planning on going back anytime soon. Users/AlexPomeranz
Edit:  I went back as part of a group.  Had their regular, nonappetizer pizza and it was _fantastic_.  This time I tried the stout and it was surprisingly mediocre for a brewpub stout.  Oh well, at least the pizza was really good.

20090330 21:24:18 nbsp Best Pizza in Vegas!  From Chicago and love deep dish.

Appetizers and salads are very good as well.  Beer is above average.  But lets talk more about the pizza! Users/rcain8

20090331 22:51:59 nbsp My fiancee and I are obsessed with this place. Their pizza is the best! Nothing in Davis compares and is worth the short drive to Natomas.  Users/EricaMacGregor

20100210 22:26:31 nbsp BJs is a fun chain that Id say is an upscale Applebees with good beer. The Vacaville location is packed on Friday and Saturday nights, so be prepared to wait for a table. Users/bear

20110308 18:39:24 nbsp Beers and Pizza are unbelievably good here. Users/nqbui89

20110416 08:05:58 nbsp The food here is amazing but I stopped coming here when I found out that each meal is equal to or more than 1000 calories. I dont know about that, but I would think that that is half the amount of calories a person needs to thrive on a daily basis. But the pizzas are great! Users/peacefulsparrow

20110418 02:37:32 nbsp Curious as to why this page exists since there is really no connection to Davis... But, Ive eaten at the one in Natomas and Elk Grove a few times and I have to say... not too impressed. Their food isnt bad, its just that I dont understand why people are willing to wait like an hour for a spot (which is what me and a few friends had to do one time) at a place thats basically a sports bar.  Users/CecilioPadilla

20111203 17:35:08 nbsp Another Dining disappointment. Went there for lunch, fish tacos tasted like old burnt fried oil. The clam chowder, maybe somebody dropped the salt shaker into it? And my sisterinlaw didnt even get her lunch. But they made it real clear, they took it off the bill. What a joke.  Users/Theangrydiner

20130109 16:36:46 nbsp Its got decent date atmosphere! Very lowkey and quiet. Its kind of pricey, though... You should probably share the Pizookies :P  Users/HannahToru
