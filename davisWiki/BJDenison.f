20100423 19:39:29 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy BJ, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I see youre editing from the same computer as Rich Solis, who just created the Verizon entry.  I noticed you removed the For other Davis options... line from the bottom of the entry.  The Wiki is a community resource, like a park, not a business listings site.  As such, the various options are generally crosslinked to each other.  Since it appears you and Rich are connected to the business, you both might want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the community written guide to the wiki for business owners.  While not absolute, it provides some helpful tips on how best to get involved in the wiki when you have a vested interest in a business listing.  Once again, welcome to the wiki, and feel free to ask any questions  were a friendly editing community here.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
