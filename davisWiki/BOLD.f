BOLD was a campus organization founded in 2010 in order to improve the representation of the general student body in ASUCD. It was created by ASUCD Senators Adam Thongsavat, Bree Rombi, and Darwin Moosavi as well as a coalition of student leaders and activists, many of whom were former L.E.A.D. supporters. BOLDs signature purpose was to help represent all communities and all students, present and future, and to make visible and lasting progress in student life. BOLD prided itself in not being afraid to take risks, and working together to help each other accomplish tasks and govern effectively.

During its short tenure in ASUCD politics, BOLD was extremely successful, controlling at one point 9 of 12 ASUCD Senate Seats along with the Executive Office.

BOLD ceased to participate in ASUCD elections as of Winter 2012  leaders say that BOLD felt it had accomplished many of its goals on campus and was beginning to lack a defining, unifying purpose. The slate began to splinter along ideological lines, and rather than become a political machine, its members decided to disband the slate.

20101024 22:50:41 nbsp Well, as far as I can remember and Ill admit, its been a few months since I was in school all members of the ASUCD Senate and Executive branch are registered undergraduate students. So, and Ill just go out and say it, but ASUCD currently is represented by 100% students. Not 50% students, or 90% students (see Chad Roberts), but 100% students. Now, reasonable people can disagree as to whether the representation of student interests within ASUCD is balanced and/or reflective of the entire student body as a whole, but thats what elections are for. And, I presume, that is what BOLD is for you feel that your interests and ideas are not currently represented (well enough) within the student government, and so you hope to win office in order to implement your platform.

Also, final note, before you call yourself a campus organization, it might be nice to register with the http://csi.ucdavis.edu Center for Student Involvement. Users/MaxMikalonis

20101024 23:03:02 nbsp Max either we already are or we will very soon be registered with CSI. Users/DylanSchaefer

20101025 01:53:52 nbsp Thank you for the clarification. Its nice to see a secondary slate utilizing the wiki, and so far more effectively than the primary. I am amused by the choice of Yellow brings me back to Student Focus, but I do hope your ideas and campaign efforts lead to quite the fight. Users/MaxMikalonis
