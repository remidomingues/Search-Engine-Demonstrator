BRÜBAR Energy Bars are local products made by a Davis company (BRU Company LLC), founded by Christian DSouza and James Radkins.  The bars are all natural, vegan, and whole grain, with no refined sugars, no trans fats, no soy, and no dairy.  They do, however, contain almonds and coconut as well as malt extract, rolled oats, and dates.  They come in four flavors: Original Malt, Apricot, Cherry Almond, and Oatmeal Raisin.  You can buy them online (see website linked above) or locally at the UCD Bookstore, Rocknasium, Whole Foods Market, The Davis Beer Shoppe, UC Davis Store Downtown, Cloud Forest Cafe, Newsbeat, B&L Bike Shop, Davis Food Coop, and Kens Bike and Ski.

BRÜBAR celebrated its 3 year anniversary with a 50% off sale in July 2013.


20130109 13:57:57 nbsp These bars are really, really tasty.  They are moist, chewy, and filling.  And unlike most energy bars, you feel like you are actually eating FOOD.  Plus, you cant get much more local than this! My only complaint is that they are a little pricey.  I would be willing to buy them in bulk for a lower price (hint, hint  if owners happen to be reading).  Users/CovertProfessor
