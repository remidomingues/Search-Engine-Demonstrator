The Unitrans B Bus Line is a short run that operates via the Memorial Union terminal only. It serves the residential district of Sycamore Lane and Drake Drive (located in the rectangle formed between Anderson Road and Highway 113 on the east and west, and by West Covell Boulevard and Russell Boulevard on the north and south).

Due to a Fall 2005 rider survey, Unitrans and the City of Davis have permanently changed the route for the B line.  The B line no longer serves the west side of Drake Drive.  All persons living on the west side of Drake Drive can catch the B line on Sycamore between Drake and Kent Drive.

B Bus Line is one of the few lines which regularly uses the DoubleDecker Buses doubledecker buses.

Check out the schedule and route map at the http://www.unitrans.ucdavis.edu/b Unitrans website for more information.

Starting August 1, 2011 the B Line will no longer serve Wake Forest. Visit http://www/untirans.ucdavis.edu/ Unitrans for more information. The C Bus Line C Line will continue to service the area.
