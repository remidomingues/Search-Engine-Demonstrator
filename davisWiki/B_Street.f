The neighborhood on the West side of the B and 3rd street  is being B Street & 3rd Street Visioning revisioned by the City.  Theres some green construction going on across from Central Park just north of Ciocolathouses that replace the houses that were moved to 3rd/J and repurposed to cooperative housing.  Signage credits the developer and gives the project a name.

 Why isnt B Street straight?
You may have noticed that B Street is bent slightly at 6th Street, while surrounding lettered streets in old North Davis are straight.  This goes back to the original orientation of the downtown core.

The original 1868 grid of Davis was laid out parallel and perpendicular to the Train Tracks railroad tracks, but the railroad does not travel exactly east/west.  It is rotated about 13° counterclockwise.  When the Bowers Addition was being mapped out, they opted to continue the railroad orientation of the streets as they built out to the north.  But this was in conflict with countylevel standard of having a true northsoutheastwest street orientation.

At B Street, which was the western boundary of the Bowers Addition, they decided to bend the street back toward true north as an accommodation to the Yolo County Roads County Road planners.  So at 6th Street, B Street bends back 8° to the east.  The full 13° correction would not have been possible without eliminating some of the home lots toward 7th Streetthus the compromise.
