The City of Davis wants to http://www.cityofdavis.org/cdd/Bstreet/ revision the neighborhood on the west side of the 3rd street 3rd and B street intersection.

http://www.cityofdavis.org/cdd/Bstreet/pdfs/12504_B_st.pdf There are three proposed options:

Alley Units
  B street frontage is maintained, no demolition
  Character of new development reflects character and scale of existing units.
  Creates sew residential alley address of carriage house.

Townhouses
  B street is predominantly residential in use and character
  Emphasis on intensifying residential uses within existing lot pattern.
  Existing houses demolished, historic resources remain

Mixed Use
  B and 3rd street become urban streets and an extension of downtown
  Emphasis on optimizing development potential of B and 3rd
  Relocates historic resources.

 History 

At the end of April 2005 the City Council voted to conceptually support creation of a Special Character District, and distinctive urban village along B and 3rd Streets (Vision 4) that would allow a mix of higher density two and three+ story attached housing forms and mixed use projects conducive to owner occupied, live/work units and creativity based occupations. City staff was asked to prepare the necessary planning amendments and environmental analysis to implement this vision. These include amendments to the Core Area Specific Plan, Downtown Davis and Traditional Residential Neighborhoods Design Guidelines, and Planned Development zone 286A.
