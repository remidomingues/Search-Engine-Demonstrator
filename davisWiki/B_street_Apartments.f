Im sure people have perfectly fine apartments in this complex.  However, my apartment has termites and mold, which is apparently common in all of the apartments.  My garbage disposal broke, my microwave doesnt rotate and my light switches (the electrical wiring of the house) are on the fritz.  I talked to them two and a half weeks ago and they have yet to do anything about the termites, except bring in a maintenance man to look at the pile of dead carcasses on my window sills, floors and dishes.  Also he helped himself to my toilet and forgot to put the seat down.  Professional, much?  The property doesnt allow pets but the property manager has two dogs living with her.  The Management (Brittain Property Management) has received terrible reviews, which can be viewed on several different sites, including the one that is posted under Website at the top of the page, and I think Ill let those reviews speak for themselves.  Apparently they do not have an email, which I find sketchy as far as businesses go.  How does a business not have an email in the 21st Century? OR a website?? Parking is bad for visitors because Black Bear will tow if you stay long enough and youd need to buy an extra permit (one time fee of $12) from the city in order to park on the street.  Overall, this place is next to squalor.  The structural integrity, the management, the maintenance, and the services are terrible and the rent is ridiculously high.  The only thing positive I could say about this is the location, but Im sure you could move on over to A Street Apartments or Villa Verde instead.  If a Building Inspector came into this place (let alone a Health and Safety Inspector), this property would be foreclosed or, at the very least, the business would lose most of their credentials.  THAT is how bad it is.  Keep looking.

But my place is pretty nice and the management is really quick in sending in repair requests. He is right about location. 1min bike ride to campus. Users/shalimar
