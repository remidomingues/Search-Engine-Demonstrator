Baby Tears, or Soleirolia soleirolii, is a carpetlike plant that you may find creeping about Davis. (But dont worry, it wont try to scare you.)  It has a somewhat mossy appearance, but on closer inspection you will see its small, tightly packed leaves, limegreen in color.  Growing no higher than two inches from the ground, the species spread far and wide within your garden in optimal conditions.  It tends to favor shadier areas and requires a fair amount of water.

Its a Mediterranean native, with no record of being invasive, so consider it a little green neighbor. Baby Tears is sold at local Nurseries.
