Getting Started with Honeybees

Basic Equipment
If you plan on keeping bees, get your equipment together as soon as possible so that you are prepared when you find the bees or the bees find you

 Tools 
 Bee Veil
 Hive Tool
 Smoker

 Hive 
 bottom board (preferably screened)
 brood boxes (2 deep size or 3 medium size)
 queen excluder
 honey boxes (13 medium or shallow size)
 frames (10 per box, make sure they are the right size for the box)
 wax foundation for frames (crimped wire is good)
 inner cover
 outer cover
 feeder (entrance feeder is easiest, frame feeder works okay and its easy to make your own top feeder out of pails or mason jars)

 Getting the Bees 
There are three traditional ways to get your own bees  buying packages, catching swarms, or getting a hold of a preestablished hive.

 Package Bees 
Ordering package bees from a local supplier is the easiest way to get started.  The advantage is that you will get a reliable queen and several pounds of good worker bees in a simple little box.  All you have to do is follow the directions and your chances of a successful introduction will be very high.  The disadvantage of package bees is that they are expensive.  See the Beekeeping Resources section on this page for local package suppliers.

 Catching Bee Swarms 
Every Spring bee colonies begin to multiply themselves by casting swarms.  Typically, the old queen will leave with half the colonys workers, and the new queen will inherit the remaining workers and the old nest.  The old queen and her workers leave the old nest in a great swarm which they fly around in until they form a cluster on a tree branch, stairwell, or any other object they choose.  Once the bees form a cluster, the beekeeper can capture the swarm by knocking it into an empty hive or container.

The advantage of capturing a swarm is that it is free, and sometimes people will even pay you to take them.  It might also be assumed that the swarm came from a colony that was strong enough to make it through the winter, so perhaps the genetics are good.  The disadvantage is that the queen may be old and past her prime, and the bees might be from feral hives or hives that were not bred for gentleness which results in mean bees.

 Buying Preestablished Hives 
Occasionally you might come across someone, often in an advertisement, who is selling used equipment with bees already in it.  While these deals are often attractive because you get equipment and bees for an often reasonable price, the danger is that the equipment harbors diseases.  It is good to have someone with experience check out the hives before you buy them to make sure they are clean of pathogens.

 Beekeeping Resources 
There are a number of great resources both here in the Sacramento Valley and in the world at large to help the beginning beekeeper get started with bees.  Remember that there is no one way to practice beekeeping, so exposing ourselves to a diversity of different methods and philosophies will make us better beekeepers.

 Literature 

It seems that every year a new book on how to keep bees is published.  The list below is far from comprehensive, as a quick check of the several hundred titles available at the Shields Library UC Davis library will confirm.  If anyone has titles they wish to add to the list, please edit them in!  The links all direct to Amazon.com for reviews, details and availability.

This is the most classic modern text for beekeeping.  The most recent edition was published in 1992 and includes 1324 pages on every topic of beekeeping that was relevant (at least back in the early 90s).  Although there is a chapter on beginning with bees, this book is as close to a bible as there is for even the biggest beekeeping operations in North America.  Where the beginner books scratch only enough of the surface to get your bees up and flying and troubleshoot a few common challenges, The Hive and the Honeybee delves deeply into all subjects pertaining to the biology, craft and business of beekeeping.

The description is To establish a community where beekeepers can learn Organic Beekeeping field management without the use of drugs, chemicals, essential oils, FGMO, acids, fungicides, bacterial/viral inhibitants, microorganism stimuli, and artificial feeds.  Some of the people can be rather dogmatic on their views of what constitutes organic, but stimulating not the less.
