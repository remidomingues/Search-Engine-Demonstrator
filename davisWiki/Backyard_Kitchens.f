20080425 09:23:44 nbsp Backyard Kitchens just finished a backyard remodel for our home in Sacramentos Land Park neighborhood. We had lots of challenges with this project  poor backyard drainage issues, an ambitious plan calling for long curved steps, lots of brick and tile, and multiple elevations in the backyard. Pete stayed within his estimated budget with lots of attention to detail and great followup. We love using our new backyard!  Bob & Kathy Waste, Sacramento Users/Rwaste

20080515 15:03:05 nbsp I love what you have done in the above pictures. There are awesome ideas for repurposing concrete, adding color, using tile and or artificial rock. I wish you the best on your project. :) Users/Lise

20080520 21:17:30 nbsp Pete is now working on our second backyard. His time, energy, and patience are second to none. We tend to go through many ideas (sometimes in midstream) and he just smiles and turns our visions into reality. He is very much responsible for our inability to get motivated to go anywhere but our backyard for entertainment. Thanks Pete!! Users/roche

20080530 12:24:47 nbsp We had Backyard Kitchens create a custom kitchen for us last year. We were not only impressed by their workmanship and creativity, but also by the friendliness of the builders. Id definitely use them again, and highly recommend them to anyone who wants a really cool backyard for entertaining.    Users/mollydog

20080609 10:46:49 nbsp Backyard Kitchens designed, poured, and finished my front patio.  I am very happy with the beautiful design and finish.  The whole thing is a great work of art.  I was also very happy with the fine level of service which Pete provided.  This guy really is an artist who uses concrete as a medium. Users/DagonJones

20081212 16:51:10 nbsp We used Backyard Kitchens to put in a small patio adjacent to our pool deck. We were pleased with the price and the outcome and the crew did a great clean up job.   Users/candrews

20100201 23:59:11 nbsp The work looks really nice!  I would love to get me one of these.  I guess I should probably buy a house first, though, huh? Users/TomGarberson

20100403 17:27:34 nbsp or... Tom, perhaps check out the EC Garden. You could rent a plot there (for cheap), and the Coordinators would probably love to have an oven/grill/etc. installed there, either in your plot or in a commmunity space. I know what its like to want for a home; hence this somewhat unconventional solution with real possibility. Users/TimQuick
