Some apartments in Davis have features that make you wonder what the designers were thinking.  If you have a notable bad design feature in your apartment, list it here, along with the complex where that feature can be found.  Some examples of bad design:

  Kitchen cabinets that are too narrow to actually put anything in that you might be likely to find in a kitchen
  Kitchen cabinets with knobs or doors that intersect the path of the stove door
  Bathrooms that can not vent shower moisture, even with the fan on
  Light switches located in awkward locations or in the wrong rooms
  Locks that prevent residents who have already gone through a lock from accessing something without going through a second lock
  Areas of the apartment that are unusable for their normal purpose
  Walls that do not shield neighbors from normal amounts of noise
  Appliances or fixtures that make living in your apartment worse, not better

20080923 21:26:29 nbsp Ive recently come across cabinets that were completely filled by a roll of aluminum foil.  In fact, I am looking at some cabinets that are either so narrow that nothing useful will fit in them (these are narrow AND have shelves in them, so cookie sheets and wire racks wont fit either).  There are some cabinets that are wide enough to actually put something in, but they are about 78 off the floor or higher.  (Really, these are only useful for storage for things you DONT want to access very frequently!)  Again, totally useless, since most people cant reach them.  But there are no accessible cabinets that are large enough to contain reasonably sized dishes without bending over, standing on a stool, or leaving the kitchen completely.  Note to the architect: People actually need a place to put things, and most people are not either 8 tall or 6 tall. Users/IDoNotExist
