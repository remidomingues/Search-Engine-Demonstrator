Baháí resources in Davis include the Davis Baháí Community and the Bahai Club at UC Davis.  There is also the peaceful and beautiful Baháí Grove.

The Baháí Faith is the youngest of the worlds independent religions. Its founder, Baháulláh (18171892), is regarded by Baháís as the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.

The central theme of Baháulláhs message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society. God, Baháulláh said, has set in motion historical forces that are breaking down traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their oneness and to assist the processes of unification.

One of the purposes of the Baháí Faith is to help make this possible. A worldwide community of some five million Baháís, representative of most of the nations, races and cultures on earth, is working to give Baháulláhs teachings practical effect. Their experience will be a source of encouragement to all who share their vision of humanity as one global family and the earth as one homeland.
