About the Bahai Faith

In just over 150 years, the Baháí Faith has become the second most widespread of the independent world religions. Embracing people from more than 2,100 ethnic, racial, and tribal groups, it is quite likely the most diverse organized body of people on the planet. Its unity challenges prevailing theories about human nature and the prospects for our common future.

Baháís work towards the creation of an everadvancing, sustainable world civilization, based on the following principles: the oneness of humanity, the equality of women and men, the elimination of all prejudices, universal education, the harmony between science and religion and the independent investigation of the truth.

Baháís believe that humanity, as a whole, has entered a new stage in its collective existence. Like an adolescent entering adulthood, new levels of accomplishment are now possible. Global undertakings, once considered impossible, can now be achieved. Such undertakings include the realization of world peace, the attainment of universal justice, and the furtherance of a harmonious balance between technology, development, human values and protection of the natural environment.

Today, our understanding of spirituality must embrace not only personal and group life, but also the collective progress of humanity as a whole. Indeed, it is only because the human race has at last entered on its stage of maturity that the old age prophecies of an era of peace and justice can now be achieved. The essential message of the Baháí Faith is the call to unity; its audience, the entire world: Let your vision be worldembracing, Bahaullah says, rather than confined to your own self.
