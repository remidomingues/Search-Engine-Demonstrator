A bait bike is when the DPD or UCDPD leave a relatively nice looking bicycle out in the open in hopes of catching someone stealing it. While long considered a myth, in March of 2012 the ASUCD Senate http://davis.patch.com/articles/ucdavisbeginsbaitbikeprogramyepitsliketheshowbaitcar#youtube_video9389161 allocated funds for the UC Davis Police Department to begin a bait bike program. The bill probably took $681 because all of the bikes at the Bike Barn are that overpriced.

20071001 16:26:52 nbsp Rob Roy was the victim of such a sting awhile back, if I remember correctly. But word is that it was a shitty, longabandoned bike. Users/GeoffJohnson

20071001 16:29:48 nbsp I dont think Rob was a part of a sting, rather he found an abandoned bike which was registered, and when the police stopped him....he got in trouble because it wasnt registered to him....if I remember.

I have never heard of this and I highly doubt this, I mean, it just sounds silly on all accounts, but someone could call up and confirm that this doesnt happen I suppose, I rather think it likely that someone is merely trying to fool us on the issue. ~DavePoole

20131013 20:07:39 nbsp I saw one of these around the 22nd of September, 2013. I hadnt heard of the program, but the bike was just sitting out in Russel Field on its kickstand. It looked brand new. I remember thinking that it looked like someone was watching for it to be stolen. Users/AndrewIrino
