History
As of 2011, UC Davis Formula SAE has become UC Davis Baja SAE.

Following Formula SAEs concept of a studentdesigned race car, Baja SAE takes the Formula concept and applies it to a offroad vehicle.

Baja SAE is a competition that challenges university students to design and compete with a baja based vehicle against other colleges in order to achieve approval for manufacture by a fictitious firm. Baja SAE provides realworld challenges that students must overcome. Some of these challenges could include rock crawling, hill climb, and even water events.

In 2012, UC Davis Baja attended its first competition, Baja SAE Oregon and received a Participation Award

Who We Are
UC Davis Baja SAE is composed of UC Davis students from a variety of majors that are involved in many facets of the continuation of the program. We love cars and all wish to make the program successful as possible.

How To Help
We welcome interested students from all majors to join our program. No experience is necessary, although it is recommended that students complete EME 50 as it is required to use some machines in the student shop.

If you are interested in joining UC Davis Baja; like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and visit our website for more information.
Our updated meeting times will be posted at the start of Fall Quarter 2012.




20111212 11:43:40 nbsp Hey John and Spencer just wanted to let you know just in case you havent seen them, google baja5b and check out this 1/5th scale RC race buggie, the engineering in technology is incredible, although theyre a little pricey, $1,100 new, when they spin out or crash they almost always land upright, again its like aircraft technology. I hope every little bit helps.  Users/Theangrydiner
