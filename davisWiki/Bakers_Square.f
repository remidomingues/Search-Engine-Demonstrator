Bakers Square was a downtown fixture ever since it replaced Sambos restaurant in 1985. The establishment was also known as Seasons at one point during the 1980s, not to be confused with the existing Seasons upscale restaurant.  The company that owned Bakers Square went bankrupt in 2008. As a result, all California locations closed in 2009. The Davis location closed for good around 8:00PM on March 25, 2009. The Bakers Square in Davis was replaced by Black Bear Diner.

Bakers Square was a good place to grab a decent meal at a decent price.  They were better than decent in the areas of pies and Breakfast breakfast (served all day long), and you could generally expect good service.  Dinners can be pricier, but portions are suitably larger.  Their coffee was better than one would expect and features free refills.  While this place was not studierfriendly, one did occasionally see people pulling it off.

A good deal was the Rise and Shine breakfast which used to cost $5.99.  You could also substitute the hash browns/country potatoes for rice pilaf, veggies, and sometimesa small salad.  Actually, one very nice thing about this restaurant was that they were more than happy to substitute just about anything. Another meal was a big hot plate of Biscuits and Gravy, for $4.99.

Bakers Square was a great place also to have a group outing.

During Christmas 2006, somebody (or some people) unassociated with the restaurant handed out red roses with a candy cane and card attached. The card read Practicing random acts of kindness during the holiday season, and included a $10 Bakers Square gift card. On 20061218, one was handed to local radio host KSTE Jack Armstrong via a waiter.



Pies

They made terrific pies, some of which were available Bakers Square/Everyday Pies all the time and others which had Bakers Square/Limited Availability Pies limited availability.  Their WiFi network was cutely dubbed WiPie.


 Parking 


The parking lot was for customers only. Over the years many students have thought that they could park in the lot just for a while... so they could run onto campus. Their cars were towed.


I really like studying there early the days of my finals.  Its generally not too noisy and its a fun place to eat breakfast and get lots of coffee.  The waitresses/waiters generally pay enough attention to me to get what I need, but leave me alone enough so I can studyI like that.Users/AmyLastname

20051216 10:17:39 nbsp The food is ho hum but good.  Quick to serve also.  And I love the variety of pies.  Ive never had to wait to be seated. Users/JoAnnaRich

20051216 12:12:20 nbsp The burgers are quite tasty here, as are the fries, but theyre also very expensive.  I stopped eating here after they significantly raised their dinner prices. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060319 13:34:17 nbsp Ah, good times have been had in the back dining room of bakers square.  Davis High School Madrigal Singers The mads can sometimes be found there after a performance.  What could be better than 20 noisy high school kids in a small restaurant?  Anyways, the staff is always awesome with large groups, and lets us stay even after closing time.. cant beat that.. Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060408 22:51:59 nbsp Such nice people. Such good pie. Nice place to go after catching a movie downtown. Users/StacieTownsend

20060806 12:26:51 nbsp Ive been here many times when they were terribly understaffed.  Two nights ago, there was one waitress for the last shift.  One man near where I was sitting was upset about this.  When the man went to pay for his slices of pie, he told the manager, who was taking his money, that there werent enough waitresses, and that while the one waitress was doing a good job, it was unfair to overwork her.  The manager muttered noncommittally, and he didnt even look the man in the face.  This manager also moved slowly and had a sour look on his face.  Bad management can make a restaurant like this one run very poorly.  I like a lot of the staff and have enjoyed my time here: the food is what youd expect, the pies and coffee are good, and our group is able to have a gathering in relative comfort, hopefully not insulting too many senior citizens with our blue tongues and dubious choices of conversation topics. Users/MisterProfessor

20061009 16:17:33 nbsp I like the pies. The food is reasonable price and good quality. Users/KiwiSelina

20061108 20:48:02 nbsp love the honey mustard crispy chicken salad Users/AnnThiNguyen

20070222 12:50:29 nbsp For breakfast, its expensive for what you get. But this is the only place in town (Cindys is too farflung) you can get regular ol breakfast: bacon, eggs, hashbrowns. I wonder why that is? Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070323 14:39:03 nbsp The flattest soda in town...  I like a lot of their food, and who wouldnt love their pies but their soft drinks are amazingly flat...  Have been for years. Users/WesHardaker

20070323 16:08:56 nbsp We went here for a breakfast meeting the other day with my department and it was good! The breakfast skillet I had was yummy and the service was also good. The waitress didnt hassle us with hows the food? or need anything? evry few minutes like some places. if you come for breakfsat get the hickory skilletmmmmm. Users/MyaBrn

20070323 17:33:29 nbsp Good omlettes.  Im not a tremendous fan of most restaurant omlettes, but the turkey they use is pretty good.  And pies.  Mmmmm... Pies.  We used to swing by and split a slice now and then.  Good stuff. Users/JabberWokky

20070324 09:08:29 nbsp pies are pretty good, breakfast is decent but nothing great, and the rest of the food is not very good at all.  I have to say im not that big of fan of this type of food, but this place isnt terrible. Users/MattHh

20070502 12:37:01 nbsp this place is decent for quick service, but the food is not the best, quite greasy. their pies are delicious though ) Users/trambajuice

20070711 17:06:00 nbsp Love their burgers and PIE! Users/JoeLow

20070716 13:00:32 nbsp I really like the veggie pita, berry pie, and the coffee. Oh yes, the coffee here is very delicious. The waitress Doreen is a hoot and the price is right for good, solid food. Highly recommended.  Users/JillBenciWoodward

20070718 14:37:50 nbsp Ok food, nothing special at all , pies are ok servers are kinda rude  Users/dickjones

20070728 19:26:53 nbsp I really dislike this place. Food is bland and basic, wait staff are clearly overworked, and it just generally feels depressing. They are also very MILITANT about towing cars. I parked in their lot and ran to campus for 15 minutes and planned to return and have coffee/pie there. Well, my car was towed within 10 minutes. Do they have a ninja watching the parking lot?? After that miserable and expensive experience, I will never eat there again. Users/GradStudent06

20070801 14:11:49 nbsp I throughly enjoy bakers square anytime I go and the good thing is their are always specials and coupons to offset the costs. Their pies are good(favorite choc silk and pumpkin pie) Great appetizers,shrimp dish is awesome, well cooked meat, service is hit or miss i have had extremely good and bad, mostly have any issue with having an empty water glass otherwise food is good Users/ElizabethBarthel

20070922 03:43:33 nbsp The service at this place sucks. I waited and waited for a waitress to go to my table last night and when I saw a waitress go to a table that had been seated after me, I had enough. I went up to her and said she should have waited on us first, but that didnt matter now because I was tired of waiting and left. I will never ever go back to this crummy place again. Users/Davisguy81

20071203 11:42:17 nbsp went last week for lunch and the service was great. Our server was very nice, anticipated our needs. Lunch was good too! Users/MyaBrn

20071218 14:57:28 nbsp The waitresses are always very nice, but sometimes slow at refilling water and bringing checks. As for the food, it depends on the meal. The hamburgers gave me and my friend stomach aches on different occasions. The chicken pot pie has been good on some occasions, and gross on other occasions (the chicken was in huge hunks and a mix of dark and light meat). The pie is pretty good. Its a bit expensive for people who are used to cheap food, but its nice to sit down and eat there sometimes. Users/Kiran

20071223 15:00:53 nbsp We live right around the corner from Bakers Square & I came here for lunch one day to eat, parked my car in the parking lot, ran home to get my wallet, ran back & my car was GONE!!!! They had my car towed literally in literally 7 minutes. It cost me $250 to get my car back! When I called to talk to the manager & explain the situation, he was EXTREMELY rude to me & when I asked him if that was his policy, to tow customers cars he laughed at me, told me it was my fault & hung up! The food here is generally gross, the staff slow, & now this? I will NEVER set foot in Bakers Square again. Users/DavisResident23
   It sucks that your car was towed, but if you live around the corner, why would you park in the parking lot instead of at your house, then run home instead of drive?

20080113 01:18:00 nbsp Dude, Ive had my car towed (within 30 min AND I ate there).  It totally sucks.  Knowing this, I cant support this place.  There are many other options. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080122 02:01:44 nbsp the breakfast SKILLETS are yummy  portion quite sizable, served on actual skillets (i like the chorizo best).  the dinner food is fine.  i wish the prices were a bit lower.

also, while im not particularly a fan of many of the pies, the bread pudding is SOOOO good and a single piece is about twice as large as the square depicted in the photo.

theyre pretty good about soda refills and the individual pitcher of coffee served is appreciated. Users/herzchen

20080211 19:08:36 nbsp I parked there because during the day it is almost impossible to get a spot on my street because of all the students that park on our street to go to class! Users/DavisResident23

20080211 19:42:05 nbsp They threatened to tow me once, too, when I parked there. Except then it was Sambos, and it was 1980. It seems there has been a longstanding problem of people using that parking lot. I assume their parking policy is posted. Users/DonShor

20080213 18:12:54 nbsp My wife just got towed after leaving her car there in an otherwise empty parking lot for 15 minutes.  Over $240 bill at the towing place which is conveniently right around the corner.  What a racket! Apparently thats all Bakers Square does anymore is profit off of towing peoples cars.  I wonder if they even make pies anymore.

Please boycott this place! Users/jackmon

20080213 18:41:10 nbsp FYI: They have installed a camera in the parking lot to catch people parking there.  If you dont enter the restaurant they immediately call the towing company.  The towing company is so close that you car will be gone in 15 min or less. Users/jackmon

20080425 14:01:49 nbsp i used to love this place... until their food made me vomit (TBA wrap)... oh... and one of their workers stole my gucci sunglasses. BS is BS. Users/hbic88

20080528 11:09:01 nbsp I still think this place sucks and anyone who says otherwise is probably staff trying to pick up the slowing business. Pretty much everyone I talk to agrees this place sucks and it really hinges on the staff most of all. Theyre slow and completely unresponsive. Users/Davisguy81

20080528 17:42:15 nbsp This is the Chancellors favorite place to eat! Ive seen him in here several times with his assistant. Users/PS2

20080620 16:34:50 nbsp Fist off, the food & prices are good. Not great, but good. The pies are always a nice treat. The servers have always been very nice to my family. A good experience all around, recommended to all. As for their parking policy... They towed me once back when I was a freshman 10+ years ago. It sucks, but hey, rules are rules.  Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080630 19:49:01 nbsp I love the pies!! Havent had the food yet, but maybe one day... Users/sweetsoni

20080911 16:31:49 nbsp When I first went there 2 years ago, the chicken pot pie was the best thing ever! But since then, the meat has been served in big chunks rather than cut up, and it is not all white meat. The food really is overpriced, considering the quality of it. Its not terrible, but its nothing great, and a lot of the dishes leave you with a stomach ache. The pie, however, is pretty cheap and delicious! I have never had problems with the wait staff, although sometimes it takes them ages to refill your water glass. Users/Kiran

20081024 21:41:01 nbsp This place was good when I was about 8 and they had Mac and Cheese on the kids menu.  It was all downhill from there.
They also used to offer halfslices of pie, but now they dont.
Just for your information, a slice of carrot cake has something like 800 calories.  Seriously. Users/MaryLieth

20081117 12:31:24 nbsp dont eat here. the WORST service ever. the waitresses here are rude and take forever. If youre a student or minority, theyll cater to everyone else before they get to you. After telling a waitress I was ready to order, she said shell be back to take my order. After 20 minutes of patiently waiting, she still didnt come to take my order, but went to take the order of other people who came later than me first! This has happened to other people as well. oh, and the food aint all that great.   Users/gato

20090131 23:07:36 nbsp Place supersucks, especially the staff. I went there with several international students whose English is not all perfect. Waitresses were totally annoyed and rude, food (except for some pies) was terrible. Steak: tiny and overover done, chicken pot pie: greasy, with an artificial taste to it.  A couple days ago, I left my car in an almost empty parking lot, and they called the towing company. Luckily, I got back in time, but the towing guy was already there. I paid 90 bucks while the two waitresses were watching the scene outside and laughed at me.  Users/AmericanSweetheart

  Are you saying you were getting your car towed from the customer parking lot while you were a customer at the time?  Cause you should have never paid. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090326 14:18:34 nbsp NOOOo! This was my most favorite breakfast place, I am so sad. My boyfriend and I went almost every Sunday :( If I knew they were closing I would have went this last sunday.  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090329 16:06:16 nbsp I showed up for my regular Sunday breakfast today and was shocked to see the sign on the door. One of the few good breakfast places left in town.  Ive eaten at Black Bear Diners before up near Redding (and theyre good), but no more pie.  Ill especially miss my favorite waitress (the one who always told you to Live it up).  I really hope she comes back when they reopen as BBD.  Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20090427 21:04:32 nbsp I was craving a lemon supreme pie the other day, and was shocked to see it they were closed for good! Sad to see them go. Maybe Black Bear will start serving pies? Users/BrookeB
