Heres some info from a press release:

The Booty Barre™ workout is a uniquely fun, highenergy group fitness experience, which combines the toning benefits of yoga, Pilates, and dance to strengthen and stretch the body. Youll firm, tighten, and tone without adding bulk  and youll burn megacalories along the way.

No dance experience is required and classes are suitable for all fitness levels. From the entrylevel Booty Barre™ Flex and Flow class to the heartpumping Booty Barre™ Plus workout, youll get results and have fun doing it.

Id been looking to offer a fun, lowimpact cardio workout that was easy on the joints, said Balance Point Pilates Studio owner Barbara Zaro. Booty Barre™ founder, and fitness expert, Tracey Mallett worked with physical therapists to design the workouts, so I knew itd be perfect for Balance Point Pilates Studio.

The workouts ensure theres not an excessive amount of repetitious movements that could cause injury to the joints. The program alternates movements to both sides of the body and varies the planes of motion within which you work so that you build strength without damaging yourself. Light hand weights, flex bands, and small exercise balls are used as props to enhance the workouts. Participants can modify movements that are too demanding quite easily. Its truly an efficient workout in terms of time and energy expended. Users/CRominger
