Baldos Mexican Food is open 24 hours and even has a drivethru. So if you are craving Mexican food late at night this is the place to go.
Their menu is quite affordable, especially if you are on a college students budget. They have a dinner menu which runs between $7.85 to $8.95 with these plates being very very large. You can get 5 handrolled tacos for $3.85, they are served with fresh guacamole, cheese, sour cream. There is the California Burrito which goes for $5 and inside there is carne asada, french fries, and guacamole (on request). The Super Giant burrito (how does it compare in size to the Guads?), $5, has your choice of carne asada, chicken, or shredded beef, and it has guacamole, rice, beans, sour cream. The carne asada fries, $6.75, have carne asada layered on fries with guacamole, sour cream and cheese on the top; no ingredients under 50% fat allowed! There are a host of other items on the menu such as quesidillas, all sorts of tacos such as tacos al pastor. They also serve all sorts of burritos too. They even have chimichangas.
They serve fresh horchata and tamarindo. Their salsa is really good, and its recommended to try their salsa verde.
If you have to use the bathroom youll have to go outside and around the drive through. They are quick at making food and very friendly.

If hunger hits 10 minutes earlier when youre returning from the Bay Area, theres a second location in Fairfield at 1730 West Texas St. This location is much classier, and bathrooms are decent, while the food is just as delicious.

Baldos accepts cash or credit card.


Car Crash
On January 23rd, 2010, a driver crashed his car into Baldos, and the car burst into flames.   It was covered by http://cbs13.com/local/vacaville.restaurant.2.1446976.html the news at KMAXTV. There is also http://www.youtube.com/watch?vfA7QFRNk1EQ video of the event on YouTube. It remodeled and reopened for business on April 1st, 2010.



20070406 22:46:00 nbsp My friends love this place for the Carne Asada fries: steak, fries, sour cream, cheese, and guac (you can take out whichever you want of course). It goes around $4 or $5 for a huge portion. Man, my friends are crazy about this stuff. Users/ThuHo

20070420 17:26:43 nbsp I love the super giant burrito and whenever I go I devour the burrito and end up ordering another dish. The other day me and buddy were taking shots of the salsa rojo. Users/MikeMele

20080118 20:51:25 nbsp i absolutely love Baldos!!!! everyone from vacaville either loves or hates this place. its a bit run down (thats putting it nicely), but thats part of their charm. this place is identical to an Adalbertos, and its my understanding that it was at one time, and the reason its called baldos, was so the owner could reuse the letters from the lighted sign. Users/JeffIto

20090117 12:36:43 nbsp So good! My boyfriend and I drive all the way from Davis for the breakfast burritos. MMMM! Users/BeckyKP

20091203 22:43:56 nbsp I love that this place is open 24 hours not like the RITE AID down the street. This is definitely the place to go INSTEAD. Users/kellyc21

20100130 11:37:08 nbsp Someone crashed a car into Baldos, and it exploded in flames. I kid you not. http://cbs13.com/local/vacaville.restaurant.2.1446976.html
You can watch it burn... http://www.youtube.com/watch?vfA7QFRNk1EQ

20100210 14:13:50 nbsp Its really sad that Baldos is closed indefinitely. The inside is a little sketchy, but if you get food togo via the drivethrough its cheap, authentic Mexican. If you go another 10 miles West the location in Fairfield is still open 24hours, and as the wiki says its a much nicer place. Id actually sit down and eat there. Users/bear

20100422 01:11:43 nbsp Ordered the #24 Breakfast Burrito: bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes it was amazing there was at least 8 slices of bacon in there with 6 tubs of their hot sauce! YUMMO! Try Chicken Fries over Carne Asada Fries if you want a change. The chicken is this shredded chicken in enchilada sauce. Super good!  Users/MissAmyQ

20100804 23:53:45 nbsp This place sounds like it would be epic to go to for a cheat meal. Users/hankim

20110207 01:17:18 nbsp Carne asada fries are good for drunk food but isnt that great tasting. Fries need to be more crispy, more guacamole is needed, and it would be nice if they had tomatoes with it too. Even though it sounds like Im hating on the place Im not. For 7 bucks it functions as 2 meals. The portions are HUGE. Taste  sub par. Value  Extraordinary. Users/David.Tran

20110208 00:40:31 nbsp I went to the Fairfield location in November and was severely disappointed. Im not sure why the wiki says this location is much classier, but I havent been to the Vacaville location so who knows. Anyway, when I went they refused to substitute beans for meat in the tacos... no explanation or apology offered. I ended up ordering the cheese enchiladas. They were cold and the cheese was not even melted. Pretty crappy meal. Oh, and there was a guy harassing customers (and blatantly staring at my friend and I) the whole time I was there. He was clearly not a customer and was making an number of people uncomfortable so I dont know why they didnt do something about it. Users/MeggoWaffle
