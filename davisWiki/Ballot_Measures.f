There were two ballot measures voted on in the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election. The first was the Countback Amendment and the second was a Constitutional Amendment that would require ASUCD members (undergrads) to pass all ASUCD fee increases by a 60% threshold.  It was referred to as the Responsible Fee Approval Initiative.  Both passed, but the exact numbers were not saved.

The texts of the ballot measures can be found here: http://www.jtleathers.com/asucd/2005_Fall/CA.07.Spring.05.pdf Countback Amendment and http://www.jtleathers.com/asucd/2005_Fall/CA.08.Spring.05.pdf Responsible Fee Approval Initiative.

Perhaps someone can post the text of the respective amendments and a discussion area below them, similar to the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election/Ballot Measures page.
