Among the many things proposed to be bans banned in Davis, a ban on Plastic Bags was discussed in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

On November 12, 2013, the City Council adopted a SingleUse Carryout Bag Ordinance. The ordinance went into effect July 1, 2014.

On May 27, 2014 City Council voted to amend the Carryout Bag Ordinance to exempt restaurants from being required to charge 10 cents for paper or reusable bags.
http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/Media/Recycling/Documents/PDF/PW/Recycle/SingleUseCarryoutBagsOrdinance.pdf Ordinance #2436 SingleUse Carryout Bags Amendment

The banning of plastic bags is a very controversial subject. San Francisco has banned plastic bags for most supermarkets and pharmacies. San Jose, Alameda County, Los Angeles(the city), Unincorporated Los Angeles County, and unincorporated Santa Clara County have also banned plastic bags. As of March, 2012, 42 different public agencies in California have passed ordinances restricting the distribution of singleuse carryout bags.  On May 22, 2012, Hawaii became the first state in the country to ban plastic bags after all four counties in Hawaii decided to ban plastic bags (http://sierraclub.typepad.com/scrapbook/2012/05/hawaiiplasticbagban.html article).

There are many reasons for plastic bag bans. One major concern is that plastic bags litter cities and create a mess to clean up. Another concern is that animals can ingest plastic bags or suffocate due to plastic bags. Plastic bag litter cleanup is costly and the cost is ultimately passed onto taxpayers.

Supermarkets and other stores generally are neutral toward or supportive of plastic bag bans. Plastic bags are currently being given away for free by stores. If plastic bags are banned, stores can sell reusable bags and earn a profit this way. The stores also save money by not having to give away free plastic bags. Increased use of reusable bags also means that stores will no longer be losing as much money by giving out paper bags. Giving away plastic and paper bags for free increases prices for all customers.

The multibillion dollar plastic bag industry is vehemently opposed to plastic bag bans. Plastic bags are made mostly from foreign oil. Oil companies also stand to lose from a plastic bag ban. Big Oil is very powerful and will no doubt spend money to oppose any ban on plastic bags.

From experiences in San Francisco, San Jose, and Alameda County the impact to consumers will be minimal. Paper bags are still available. Reusable bags are readily available in supermarkets and pharmacies. Once people become used to carrying around reusable bags, a plastic bag ban is no big deal. Plastic bag bans can be good for the environment and ultimately will reduce costs for stores since they will no longer have to pay for plastic bags to give away for free. The cost savings from eliminating plastic bags will save stores money and ultimately can lead to lower prices.

The ultimate losers of a plastic bag ban are the plastic bag industry and oil companies.

 Proposed DRAFT Davis Carryout Bag Ordinance 
(NOTE: This is NOT the ordinance that the City ultimately voted to enact.  This section refers ONLY to the draft ordinance proposed by the Citys Natural Resources Commission)
At the request  of the Natural Resources Commission (NRC), and at the urging of the community, the City is looking into an ordinance limiting the distribution of singleuse carryout bags.  The goal of the ordinance is to reduce the distribution of single‐use carryout bags and encourage the switch to reusable carryout bags.

The http://publicworks.cityofdavis.org/Media/PublicWorks/Documents/PDF/PW/Recycle/CarryoutBagOrdinanceDraft.pdf original draft of the Citys Carryout Bag Ordinance would have only applied to grocery stores, convenience stores, liquor stores and large drug stores in Davisthis was changed by City Council and the final ordinance applies to ALL retail and ALL restaurants.  A 10 cent per bag charge would be applied to all carryout paper bags distributed at the point of sale at affected stores to encourage people to bring their own reusable bags. However, these paper bags must be recyclable and contain 40% postconsumer content as is the case with all similar municipal ordinances. The 10 cent charge is the estimated cost of recovery incurred by stores for distribution of the recyclable large sized paper bags and is also the most common fee imposed by other municipalities with such ordinances.  The stores keep the 10 cent fee. Reusable bags would be required to have a charge, to prevent retailers from simply handing out thicker plastic carry out bags for free.  The proposed ordinance would only restrict carryout bags provided at the point of sale, it does not include meat and produce bags or pharmacy bags.  Restaurants and food vendors would have been exempt under the proposed draft, but as noted above, City Council decided to include them in the final ordinance.

The DRAFT ordinance contained a mandate for retailers to track and report the use of paper bagsthis requirement was removed in the final ordinance that was passed by Council in November 2013. Some business owners considered this provision complicated and unnecessarily cumbersome. Others stated during public comment at meetings that they are required to itemize all things purchased by customers, bags included, so very little extra work would be required. Such clauses are not included in all similar ordinances, such as one recently passed in http://www.iwma.com/admin/ordinances/Draft%20Single%20Use%20Bag%20Ordinance%2011211.pdf San Luis Obispo County, which does not require reporting for paper bags. However, such a clause does allow the City of Davis to verify how effective the ordinance is in reducing singleuse carryout bags usage and verify if a store is noncompliant (handing out paper bags for free).  Ultimately, the City Council decided to remove the reporting requirements from the ordinance.

http://publicworks.cityofdavis.org/administrative/naturalresourcescommission/singleusecarryoutbags More information about the Citys DRAFT Carryout Bag Ordinance.
The NRC reviewed the draft ordinance at their http://publicworks.cityofdavis.org/Media/PublicWorks/Documents/PDF/PW/Recycle/0326NRCAgendaPacket.pdf#page16 March 26, 2012 meeting and voted 42 to accept the draft ordinance for staff to begin the CEQA environmental review process.
http://publicworks.cityofdavis.org/Media/PublicWorks/Documents/PDF/PW/Recycle/0227NRCAgendaPacket.pdf#page125 February 2012 Staff Report to the NRC regarding a proposed Carryout Bag Ordinance.


The ordinance was originally proposed by the Citys Natural Resources Commission NRC Zero Waste Subcommittee in November 2011. The NRC Subcommittee drafted an ordinance to cover all the major grocery, drug, and large chain stores in Davis (about 2 dozen total) while almost all of the small downtown business merchants would be exempt.  The Subcommittee estimated that this would eliminate well over 90% of the estimated 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 larger size, singleuse plastic bags distributed annually in Davis.  Restrictions on the thinner handleless plastic bags shoppers use for meats and produce within a store were not included in this ordinance for sanitary reasons and restaurants.

 Other Local Efforts to Reduce SingleUse Carryout Bags in Davis 

  CalPIRG has collected over 4,500 individually signed petitions to the NRC signed by UCD students requesting the City ban plastic bags.
  The Davis Food Coop has never bought and used singleuse takeout plastic bags, and already charges $0.05 for a paper bag.
  Trader Joes only gives out paper bags
  Several stores like Nugget and Target give you a discount for bringing your own bags
  The UC Davis Stores implemented a charge for single use bags after a bag ban proposal was brought forth by ASUCD Senator Darwin Moosavi


 Local impact of plastic bags after February 2012 high winds 

February 2012 brought high winds to Davis and a pair of articles at the end of the month, describing the impact of plastic bags in Davis.

An article by Alan Pryor in The Vanguard (Wind Storm Litters Davis Countryside with Plastic Bags Right Before NRC Considers SingleUse Bag Ordinance) showed photos of thousands of plastic bags in the slough just to the south of the Yolo County Central Landfill.  Pryor stated, it was obvious they had been blown from the land fill over the retaining fence during the wind storm.  He also noted that the plastic bags had traveled quite a bit: Even worse, driving back to the freeway and West Sac along Co. Rd 105, I counted over 200 plastic bags in the weeds, trees, and barb wire fences along the roadways before even getting to the freeway. Some of these bags were over a mile away from the landfill.

The Davis Enterprise ran a similar article (Davis residents help clean up plastic bags near landfill), reporting on the experiences of Davisites Davis resident Cayce Wallace.  Confirming the Vanguard story, the article reported: The wind had blown plastic bags of all kinds off the landfill site and throughout the area, in some cases sending them more than two miles away to nearby farmland, and covering several spots where thousands of birds nested.  According to Wallace, There were a couple of great blue herons that were standing in the middle of the trash and egrets that were landing and then I went back and there were birds that had gotten caught up in the plastic. There was a kestrel and a cattle egret, they were picking at it, trying to get it off of them.  Wallace says that she helped untangle the birds from the bags and then spent several weeks trying to clean up the bags, accompanied by several friends.  According to Jacques DeBra, city of Davis public utilities manager, picking up all the garbage can be difficult, since new trash is brought in daily to the landfill, adding to the potential for noncompacted or uncovered trash to blow with the wind.  In 2010, the landfills staff estimated workers spent more than 1,815 hours picking up litter at the landfill, costing roughly $34,000.

Comments.

20130612 03:09:27 nbsp Personally I love getting plastic bags. When I had an apartment Id always get plastic bags after buying groceries. I find them useful to put trash and recycle instead of using large trash bags. It saves me money. Also when Im at home in Davis I can use them to pick up poop for my dogs. Its a win/win situation in my book.  Users/teamdarwin
  Why do you think that other people should subsidize your use of plastic bags?  If you want plastic bags, buy them, and recognize that they have a real cost.  The world does not owe you free plastic bags.   Users/CovertProfessor

20130707 02:59:17 nbsp Yes the world owes me free plastic bags. Users/SarahMD

20130707 03:01:42 nbsp And healthcare. Users/SarahMD

20140125 15:50:59 nbsp I embrace the plastic bag for picking up the dog poo, too. Should this be on the dog page instead? BUT! Grocery Outlets plastic bags are so flimsy (as are CVS, safeway, I can go on), they cant even reliably hold dog poo, much less my groceries. But like the professor says, I do feel that I can afford to buy some bags for this personal item, except, OMG I have like thousands already stockpiled! Im set for dog poo Armageddon. PLEASE Davis, get this ban going.   Users/JaneBF

20140512 08:16:37 nbsp How is this handled in a grocery store?  Does the cashier wait until the bagger finishes bagging, then puts in the actual number of paper bags used for large orders?  (And lets recognize not all customers go through the express 15item or less lanes...I at least do large trips to save money)  Is there any recourse if the bagger uses more bags than we feel later were needed?  At a dime per bag, isnt in the stores interest to push unnecessary overusage of paper bags onto the customer?  Users/JeffWood Users/JeffWood
  Im going to guess that most stores will now bag everything first and then charge you, and if you object to the number of bags used, you are more than welcome to say so.  Stores arent going to make you buy a bag, they just cant give them out for free anymore.  JeffT

20140710 10:29:40 nbsp Some of these comments make no sense. A business has been giving customers plastic bags for years! The cost has been part of doing business. To claim that the bags have a real cost is pointlessthe cost has been part of the business for decades. If Target wanted to stop using bags, they were welcome to do so at any point. Any store can choose not to give the customers bags, or charge them for the bags. Its called doing business. What annoys me is the ban. If people want a business to save money or if they believe that the plastic bags are bad, they are welcome NOT to use the bags. But how about giving us the freedomthe optionto use the plastic bags for our purchases, perhaps then reuse the plastic bags for some other purpose (cleaning up after our dog, recycling cans, trash, etc.), and then recycle the plastic bags when we are done using them.
If the concern is trash, then how about a ban on all beverage holders? And perhaps a ban on cars as well? How about a ban on all packaging? A ban on all candy bar wrappers? I see more of that trash everywhere than plastic bags. Users/ChrisBenoit

20140710 10:36:48 nbsp Only rigid plastics are recyclable, like milk gallon containers. Users/ToddKaiser
What do the grocery stores do with the plastic bags in their recycle containers that say  plastic bags only ?  Sue
Hmmm not sure, Ive never even noticed those. But most small cities are not able to recycle plastic bags. It makes more sense to remove them from circulation rather than have 90% (making this figure up) end up in the dump. Todd

20140713 20:36:23 nbsp ChrisBenoit, actually I think a ban on unnecessary packaging is a great idea. Users/MeggoWaffle
