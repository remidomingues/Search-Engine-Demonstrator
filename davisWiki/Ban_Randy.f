Le sigh.


   I did pop one, and took it off.  Not much reason at this point, as he seems to have started talking.  I still have no idea what his goal is. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵

Frankly, I think the guy needs a temporary IP ban until he cools off and/or communicates.  He knows how to get in touch with at least JabberWokky, and Im sure hell have no problem finding my email address if he wants to.  Ive also suggested to him that he call his frat brother Dylan Schaefer to help sort this crap out if he doesnt trust others here. Users/TomGarberson
   Done.  If anybody disagrees, feel free to speak up.  Its time pressing and theres been enough abuse it seems like the right thing. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
   Thank G_d. Users/OliviaY
     I was actually in the middle of double checking the IP when he called... I was going to ban him then.  Since we were disconnected, and he had shown some interest in communicating, I held off for a little bit.  Alas, twas not to be.  jw

  I sent out a message, hopefully it should stop. Dylan
