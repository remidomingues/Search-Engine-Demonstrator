From the makers of skittobrauer and sproclate comes another delicious creation. When at a friends house, Users/TaylorClark suggested putting a banana in a quesadilla. So they put cheese and sliced banana in a tortilla and grilled it(if you make it in the microwave, it WILL NOT taste good!). He was suprised at how good it tasted.

Users/JohnDudek has yet to try the dreaded banana quesadilla, but he probably will this coming thanksgiving break.
