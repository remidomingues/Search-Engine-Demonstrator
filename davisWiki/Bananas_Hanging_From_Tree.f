On 20051202 circa 8PM there were a bunch of banana peels hanging from a tree along the walkway in the quad.  Accompanying the bananas was a graphical note that read HUNG and had a black and white photograph of a hanging contraption (see below).  It seemed to be a project done by some Art Department Art students.

I think its brilliant. Wellhung fruit. Bananas being phallic symbols. Its a comment on the mechanization of culture: the bananas needed human intervention to hang from a tree. Its also a nod to Strange Fruit the Billie Holiday classic. Users/SteveDavison
