The BandUh Sushi Challenge is yet another tradition created by California Aggie Marching BandUh the band geeks.  Step One of the Challenge is to go to Fuji Chef Fujis.  Step Two is to eat 15 dishes of sushi.  There are a few exceptions to this.  Oranges are not counted, so you cant just eat a bunch of fruit, youll probably have to eat at least some rice.  Edamame (Soybeans (Those things that look like peapods)) are worth two.  I think theres a limit of two dishes of edamame per time.  Thats it.  If you succeed, the admiration of your peers and glorious adoration of millions.  If you fail, the scorn of all those that you once thought loved you.  And Users/KeithChong Keith will spit on your children.

This is not actually an active band tradition. In any way.

This is a joke, right? Ive never heard of the Banduh! Sushi Challenge and Im IN the Banduh! I dont even like sushi!  Users/ThomasFifield TF

I can eat 16 plates easy, and my friend can eat 22.  This is not a challenge at all for the experienced stomach.   Users/RobertBaron

My Users/AmyZimmerman sister can eat 22 plates, too. Im not saying its not a feat or anything, because it is.  Users/SharonZimmerman
