Though Davis is usually thought of as a relatively low crime city, we have had our share of bank robberies (and burglaries) over the years.  We just tend to quickly forget about them.  This page is an effort to chronicle the plundering of various banks in our fair city, as well as the eventual outcomes of each incident.

Were trying to stick to official records and sources, but if youve heard rumors or stories, feel free to add them to the Comments section.  If you remember an incident, try Googling for newspaper articles at the time.

Bank robberies arent actually that uncommon in Davis.  One of the California Aggie articles about the recent robberies mentioned this: ...the police said bank robberies occur periodically in Davis.  We normally get hit a couple of times a year, Sgt. Paul Doroshov said.  If we have a year without a bank robbery, were lucky.

There are seven Banks within three blocks of ACE Hardware Davis Lumber & Hardware and they had to stop selling guns because there were too many bank robberies where people had bought guns immediately before. Similarly, the hardware store offers free pens which are useful for endorsing a check at the ATM when the bank is closed, the hardware store is open, and you dont have a pen.

There are precautions that banks could take to prevent bank robberies, however many banks do not want to spend money on bulletresistant glass or security entrances with metal detectors to protect customers or employees. Entrance Control Systems feature a double door entrance system with bulletproof glass. These provide a buffer between the bank and the outside with a metal detector system. Only after visitors are scanned will the bullet proof doors unlock to let visitors in. http://hamiltonsafe.com/site/banking/entrance_control_systems link
