While Bank of America is officially a national bank with headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, the California branches operate under their own network and set of banking rules.  There are several segments to BoA, and certain services are unavailable when you cross the borders between segments.  If you move to Davis with a BoA account (or move from Davis), you will be asked to set up a new account. It was formed when Nations Bank bought Bank of America in 1998. Nations Bank took over the Bank of America name and moved operations from Bank of Americas longtime San Francisco Headquarters to the Nations Bank headquarters in North Carolina. Bank of America is one of Davis many banks and has one branch location in Davis. Bank of America used to be a major employer in the San Francisco Bay Area, however once Nations Bank took over operations, they closed down most of their Bay Area call centers and moved jobs to North Carolina and other states.

Bank of America used to have a branch inside of Save Mart. However, Bank of America closed the branch down and replaced it with a small ATM.

Bank of America does not have a student checking account, but they do have an ebanking checking account that has no monthly fee or minimum balance if you do all transactions at the ATM. Checks cost extra and can cost over $35. You will be charged $8.95 per month if you make a deposit or get cash from a teller.

Warning: Bank of America conducts Hard credit pulls. This is the worst type of credit inquiry and lowers your credit score and can damage your credit rating. They conduct hard credit pulls when you open any type of account such as a checking or savings account. These hard credit pulls can add up and bring down your credit score. If you are applying for a car loan or home loan this could mean a difference of thousands of dollars.

Bank of America was planning on charging customers $5 per month if they use their debit cards for purchases in 2012. However, due to negative publicity and losses of customers, Bank of America decided to not adopt the new fee. The fee would have cost customers $60 per year if they used their debit card every month.


Fraud Alert: 05/2011 $10 million stolen from customers: According to news reports, a BofA employee with access to account holder information allegedly leaked personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, bank account numbers, drivers license numbers, birth dates, email addresses, family names, PINs and account balances to a ring of criminals. With that information, the fraudsters reportedly hijacked email addresses, cell phone numbers and possibly more, keeping consumers in the dark about new accounts and checks that had been ordered in their names.

Some 300 BofA customers in California and other Western states have reportedly had their accounts hit, and 95 suspects linked to the breach were arrested by the Secret Service in February 2011.

BofA says it detected the fraud a year ago in 2010, but only recently began notifying affected customers of the breach in 2011. http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id3673&rf20110525eb link

ATMs

There are also five separate Bank of America ATMs ATM locations (apart from the one at the actual bank branch): at the Memorial Union, Silo, University Mall, Save Mart, and Oakshade Town Center.

You will be charged $2 by BofA for using a nonBofA ATM in addition to the fee charged by the nonBofA ATM (usually $3). You will be charged $5 for using ATMs outside of the U.S. in addition to the fee charged by the foreign ATM.

Check imaging fee is $3 per statement starting 01/06/2011.

20100911 21:30:10 nbsp Almost every transaction I have with this bank ends up being a hassle and a frustration.  I recommend using one of Davis credit unions instead.  Users/CovertProfessor

20101216 09:26:47 nbsp One of the worst experience here ever! I know bank of America is not known for their customer service but this tops the cake.

So I needed to have a document notarized for my apartment complex and my one of my landlady said that your bank should do it for you. I went to my bank last week with the form to ask for their assistance in filling out my form and to ask about the notarize process. The male teller at the desk told me how to fill it out (he didnt know how like whether government funds and grants are included in your income but that was ok bc he tried) and when Im done to bring it back and one of the reps will notarize for me. I was really appreciative because he was friendly and trying to be helpful.

Yesterday I came back to get my document notarized and another male teller said no the bank only notarizes official bank documents. And Im like Wtheck? So I call up my landlady and she says that shes had other residents turn in their form and their banks notarize for themincluding boa. And my landlady says that it supposed to be included in ur bank service and that i should threaten to close my account if they didnt. I go back in, this time talking to Dale (a female teller) and explain my situation. But she looked pissed off. She even has the notarize lady come over and to assert that no they didnt do it, but I no one explained to my why! And I remember Ive had boa notarize before! And I go with my landladys advice and threaten to close my account and Dale says we can close it for your right now. Do you have your debit card? Just slide it. Im thinking wow what a flip. These people dont care about customer satisfaction at all! No wonder the north Davis branch closed.

Seriously, the only think good about this place is that theres rarely a line. Gee I wonder why! With tellers like Dale who wants to come back. Im mad about the fact that they didnt seem to care about making the customer happy; they just wanted to get rid of me.

One of my land ladies also told me she closed her boa account 2 yrs ago bc of their customer service and fees. Now I understand how she feels. Users/LynnNguyen
   When in doubt, ask to speak with their manager/supervisor before threatening to close your account. Users/ClarenceL
     Leaving Bank of America can save you a lot of money in the long run. There are many credit unions that notarize documents for free. There are many credit unions that have more benefits and fewer fees than Bank of America. Opening an account with a Credit Unions credit union is also easy to do and many credit unions in Davis offer free checking accounts with no monthly fees and many give you free checks. Bank of America charges fees in sneaky ways just so that they can make huge profits off of customers. You can get even better deals at notforprofit credit unions. Users/MaxLucas
   Bank of America used to notarize documents for customers.  Im not sure when they stopped doing everything except bank documents, but it has been at least a few years at this branch.  (Bank of America locations elsewhere might be different  I know one in another state had no problem notarizing a document for us for free a couple years ago.)  They probably did it as a costcutting maneuver, but Id be surprised if notarizing documents was really taking up all that much time.  If for some reason, their notary agent is licensed for bank documents only, then it would make sense, but otherwise it is a move that irritates customers without gaining much for the bank.  When I asked for the reason a couple years ago, the agent didnt know.  FedEx Office has a notary agent that works there sometimes.  If you ask, theyll give you his contact info and you can arrange to meet him at a convenient time downtown.  (Oh, and Dales always been friendly to us.)  Users/BigSlice
  Every person who is a notary in California is able to notarize documents whether they are bank related or not. The staff simply didnt want to waste their precious time to help a Bank of America customer. Apparently, this is the level of customer service at this Bank of America branch. They probably spent more time arguing with the customer than it would have taken to notarize the document. You really have to go out of your way to make a customer have such a horrible experience like this.  Users/MaxLucas

20110625 16:49:41 nbsp As an account holder for 9 years I have had a generally positive experience at this branch.  Dale, Alex, and Aaron and some others have all been a pleasure to work with.  Users/bartbart

20121106 09:13:55 nbsp Ive been a Davis BoA customer for 15 years, starting when they had an outlet bank in the Albertsons grocery in North Davis.   When it was local I knew the banker and had a personal relationship.  Now that they have consolidated downtown, I am shocked at their lack of personalization.   I closed my account last weekend and went across the street to Chase after my latest bad experience.  I went in to deposit my check and was told it would take a week to clear.  I have a stellar credit history. This was a new one; hey I do have bills to pay.  I asked for an exception and was denied with out any discussion other than being told there are a number of factors that go into their policy.  Well heres my factor, Im outa here.  Users/StanSturges

20131030 11:51:08 nbsp NEVER send money in a foreign currency to one of BoAs $accounts. They will take about 4% of everything you send with their very unforable conversion rate, e.g. for EUR>$ conversions. Better choose another bank or have it sent denominated in $.  Users/nivacm
