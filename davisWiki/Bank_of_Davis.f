The Bank of Davis was the second bank ever to be located in Davis, preceded only by a Davis branch of the Bank of Yolo.  Opened by JB Anderson in late 1910 or early 1911, the Bank of Davis was originally just a small wooden building at the corner of 2nd Street and G Street.  This was later replaced by the brick Anderson Bank Building which housed several other businesses in addition to the bank.
