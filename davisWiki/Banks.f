Davis is home to several different banks, where you can store your Money. Or, you may prefer to do business with a credit unions credit union, which are notforprofit cooperatives that offer the same services as a bank.  Any earnings benefit members instead of going to billionaire bank owners or shareholders of corrupt banking corporations. Big Banks control massive amounts of wealth and with this wealth they wield great political power by influencing and bribing politicians to approve favorable legislation. Big banks are responsible in the past for predatory lending and other decisions that brought about the housing collapse as well as the downfall of the economy. Moving your money away from the Big Banks reduces the power that Big Banks have over politicians in government.

The Big Banks have become so big that if one of them fails, it would bring down the entire economy with them. We need to reduce the risk of this happening by moving our money away from the Big Banks who want a monopoly by controlling everyones money. Moving money from Big Banks to smaller locally owned banks or credit unions will reduce the power that Big Banks have over the entire economy. A collapse of a bank such as Citibank would have devastated our economy and increased inflation to extreme levels. Allowing these banks to become too big is what caused them to have such a dramatic effect on our economy.

The Government has listed several banks as too big to fail. The government would use taxpayer money to keep these banks afloat even though they deserve to go bankrupt due to their own poor financial decisions and corrupt leadership. Regular citizens already have financial problems of their own, and they arent getting a helping hand from the government to prevent their own bankruptcies like the Big Banks did.
