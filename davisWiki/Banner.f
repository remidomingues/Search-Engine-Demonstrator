Is there an entry for the banners that hang over a few streets downtown?  Theres always one across 5th as it meets A, and a couple other spots.  Do they have an official name?  Who determines who places them?

Theres also probably a better name for this entry, which is why Im not linking to it until somebody comes up with a better name.  I dont know if theres an official name, so Ill hold off to see  if somebody knows what they are called.  In any case, shouldnt the name be plural, i.e., banners?

its something like the Est Downtown Davis entrance Banner

Banners that appear on a regular basis, reoccurring each year include:

  Tree City USA
  Picnic Day
  WEF(?)
  Celebrate Davis
  Turkey Trot
  Theres a child abuse banner near the 113 exit and Russell.  Its poorly worded.

They are from either Rotary or the chamber Daubert
  Oh, yeah... that Rotary BBQ in Central Park is often up there too. Theres a question mark after WEF because I listed it without being sure its up there... it just seems like it should be, so I may be inventing a memory of it there. jw

Banners were thru either the Rotary or the City Managers office, but they were actually put up by Davis tree crew....back when we had one...TDD
