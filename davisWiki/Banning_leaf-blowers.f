A movement exists in Davis to bans ban leafblowers (or at least gas powered ones) due to their effects on the local surroundings, in terms of noise ordinance noise, air quality and the pollution environmental impact of the engines.  One of the groups that wishes to ban them is the Davisites for Less Noise and Particle Pollution, or DLNPP.  They have a facebook group, and are trying to rally enough people to their cause to persuade the Davis City Council to recognize their concerns and take action. Banning leafblowers is not an idea unique to Davis. Several other cities have considered the matter, with some choosing to adopt bans with varying levels of enforcement.

 Types 
There are several types of portable leaf blowers:
   2cycle gasoline/oil engine
   4cycle gasoline engine
   Corded electric
   Cordless electric

By far the most common type, and that used by almost all grounds maintenance workers, is the 2cycle gasoline/oil engine. This type is inexpensive, very loud, and because heavy oil must be mixed directly with the gasoline (typically 32:1 ratio), highly polluting. Blowers with 4cycle engines (like cars use) are available from Craftsman, Makita, Ryobi, Shindaiwa, TroyBilt, and others. Electric motors are far quieter since fuel is not exploded in pulses, and there is no exhaust whatsoever. They can be even more powerful than gasoline engine types. The corded electric types require an extension cord to be continuously plugged in. The cordless types have a portable battery. For this reason, the cordless types are often less powerful (to prolong battery life), and more expensive due to the battery cost. They also require recharging after some period of use which may make them unsuitable for professional (allday) use.

Any ban should address the issue at hand (noise, air pollution, dust, etc.) rather than be technologyspecific. For example, if noise is the issue the ban should be written blowers louder than XXXdBA are banned rather than all blowers are banned because they are loud. This way, if a 2cycle engine were fitted with a muffler it could pass.

 Data 
Environmental Effects
Based on 1998 data, a report from the California Environmental Protection Agency back in 2000 found that a leaf blower may produce much more pollution than a modern car in several categories excepting CO2. For CO (Table 9), the estimated 423 g emitted by one hour of leaf blower use is approximately 26 times the amount emitted by a new vehicle, but approximately onethird of the CO emissions of an older vehicle. While not implying that the operator will inhale this amount of CO, these data do suggest concern about the relatively large amount of CO emitted directly into the air space surrounding the operator. For particulate matter exhaust emissions, the leaf blower emits eight to 49 times the particulates of a light duty vehicle, primarily because of the large amount of unburned fuel directly released by the twostroke engine ... and for the average 1999 leaf blower and car data presented in Table 9, we calculate that hydrocarbon emissions from onehalf hour of leaf blower operation equal about 7,700 miles of driving, at 30 miles per hour average speed. The carbon monoxide emission benchmark is signficantly different. For carbon monoxide, onehalf hour of leaf blower useage (Table 9) would be equivalent to about 440 miles of automobile travel at 30 miles per hour average speed (http://www.noiseoff.org/document/cepa.report.pdf pages 5051).

Since 2000, the US EPA has enacted a series of regulations mandating substantial improvements in emissions.  The CEPA report, using data from 1998, includes a relatively small number of blowers produced after a 1995 USEPA regulation which mandated a 33% reduction in emissions.  In 2000, a second phase of emissions reduction was adopted in stages over the next several years, beginning in 2002 with the last stage in 2006. At the time of its adoption, the second phase was projected to result in an additional 70% reduction in hydrocarbon and NOx emissions by the year 2010 over the initial 1995 regulation (http://www.cleanaircounts.org/documents/Leaf%20Blowing%20Emissions%20Modeling%20Report.pdf sourcep. 3).  In 2007, the EPA passed a third emissions regulation mandating an additional 35% reduction in hydrocarbon evaporative emissions, to go into effect by 2011 or 2012 depending on the size of the motor (http://www.epa.gov/otaq/equipld.htm source).  In all, there have been dramatic reductions in the emissions of gas blowers in recent years, especially in regards to hydrocarbons, NOx, and evaporative emissions. CO and overall particulate matter air pollution have probably also improved at least somewhat over the course of the decade, but it is difficult to determine exactly how much so. The least change, if any, would likely be found in the amount of fugitive dust emissions over the years, especially when one considers that the whole point of a leafblower is to blow about scattered foliage and debris. It should also be noted that many of the older leaf blowers are still in use as of 2010, owing to the fact that phase two was only completed as late as 2006.

Health Effects

(from Users/SteveDavies)

There are plenty of studies. Fact: Leaf blowers emit nitrogen oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds, which react with sunlight to create tropospheric, or groundlevel, ozone. The serious, negative health effects of ozone are well documented. NOx also are harmful to human health. See the link below to an EPA study about the human health effects from exposure to NOx.

One of the best sources for information about the health effects of ozone is the National Research Councils report from 2008: http://www.eswr.com/docs/tfea/goc_nrcozone_summary.pdf (link to summary). Press release: http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID12198.

Shortterm exposure to current levels of ozone in many areas is likely to contribute to premature deaths, says a new National Research Council report, which adds that the evidence is strong enough that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should include ozonerelated mortality in healthbenefit analyses related to future ozone standards.  The committee that wrote the report was not asked to consider how evidence has been used by EPA to set ozone standards, including the new public health standard set by the agency last month.

Ozone, a key component of smog, can cause respiratory problems and other health effects.  In addition, evidence of a relationship between shortterm  less than 24 hours  exposure to ozone and mortality has been mounting, but interpretations of the evidence have differed, prompting EPA to request the Research Council report.  In particular, the agency asked the committee to analyze the ozonemortality link and assess methods for assigning a monetary value to lives saved for the healthbenefits assessments.

Based on a review of recent research, the committee found that deaths related to ozone exposure are more likely among individuals with preexisting diseases and other factors that could increase their susceptibility.  However, premature deaths are not limited to people who are already within a few days of dying.

The report itself notes that There are myriad major outdoor sources of VOCs, including vegetation, solvent use, and mobile sources. Ambient sources of NOx include fuel combustion (for example, in cars, trucks, construction equipment, factories, and power plants) and to a lesser extent biogenic activity.

In its 2008 final rule lowering the acceptable level of ozone for metropolitan areas, EPA said, The Staff Paper concluded that the overall body of evidence clearly calls into question the adequacy of the current standard in protecting atrisk groups against an array of adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, nonaccidental mortality, and possibly cardiovascular effects. These atrisk groups notably include asthmatic children and other people with lung disease, as well as all children and older adults, especially those active outdoors, and outdoor workers.\16\ The available information provides strong support for consideration of an O3 standard that would provide increased health protection for these atrisk groups. The Staff Paper also concluded that risks projected to remain upon meeting the current standard are indicative of risks to atrisk groups that can be judged to be important from a public health perspective. This information reinforced the Staff Paper conclusion that consideration should be given to revising the level of the standard so as to provide increased public health protection.

Heres another excerpt:

Newly available large multicity studies and related analyses (Bell et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005; and Schwartz, 2005) designed specifically to examine the effect of O3 and other pollutants on mortality have provided much more robust and credible information. Together these studies have reported significant associations between O3 and mortality that were robust to adjustment for PM and different adjustment methods for temperature and suggest that the effect of O3 on mortality may be immediate but may also persist for several days. Further analysis of one of these multicity studies (Bell et al., 2006) examined the shape of the concentrationresponse function for the O3mortality relationship in 98 U.S. urban communities for the period 1987 to 2000 specifically to evaluate whether a threshold level exists. Results from various analytic methods all indicated that any threshold, if it exists, would likely occur at very low concentrations, far below the level of the current O3 NAAQS and nearing background levels.

  Steve, youve provided a lot of documentation about the health effects of O3 which I dont think anyone disputes.  Have you provided any quantitative information on the relationship between leaf blowers (in Davis or in general) and O3?  All I noticed was the conclusory statement, Fact: Leaf blowers emit nitrogen oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds.  I dont think anyone would dispute that.  What you didnt address is the significance of their contribution to the O3 problem which seems to be the basis of your argument.  So, how significant is that contribution?  Do leafblowers contribute 10% of the anthropogenic nitrogen oxides and VOCs with which we have to contend?  If so, a ban would presumably have a major impact.  On the other hand, if they contribute 0.0001%, the ban would presumably have a de minimis effect on the groundlevel O3 problem, rendering the entire issue irrelevant. Users/TomGarberson

 Arguments In Favor of Banning LeafBlowers 
  There is a http://www.facebook.com/pages/DavisitesLNPP/122631437795225 Facebook page concerning this issue.  They plan to use Likes on the Facebook page to push the city council to regulate leaf blowers more. Do your part to help Keep Davis Boring! (WTF? How are leafblowers associated with fun? What is boring about not having a leaf blower wake you up after a night of drinking?)

Davis is a wonderful community with a vibrant downtown scene and people diverse residents. As fall approaches, our green town is covered by dry leaves of all colors and sorts.  Most gardeners have resorted to leafblowers to deal with the issue in a quick and dirty way. And out of all leaf blowers on the market, many have picked gas leafblowers  the worst kind.

Leafblowers  regardless of the type  move leaves by blowing air. However, lighter than leaves and more susceptible to upward winds is dust and other particulate harmful to humans and animals. Thus, leaf blowers, aside from merely relocating leaves, increase the particulate matter (or particle pollution) making our breathing harder and causing peoples allergies to actup. Kids are the most affected by this.

Leaves can be relocated almost as quickly with a rake, lifting less dust into the air. And lets not forget that rakes are much quieter than leaf blowers! Gas leafblowers particularly are not only louder but even more polluting.

Our businesses downtown, many of which have wonderful outdoor patios, deal constantly with extra cleanup of dust and disturbed customers due to leaf blowers. some students cannot study in peace in their homes because a gardener going from buildingtobuilding can take hours with a leafblower emitting up to 100 decibels of noise when close to windows! Cars and bikes get covered by dust, especially frustrating if they have been recently washed. Lower height plants like flowers get covered by dust much faster and dryout.

So lets do our town a favor and push gardeners, and property owners to switch to the good old rake.

As a matter of fact, through reasonable regulations, many cities of similar sizes and characteristics across Northern California, including but not limited to Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Los Altos have made the issue of leafblowers into a benefit to the community with less noise and air pollution by starting programs like collecting the leaves for composting. In fact, at least 20 cities in California already have leaf blower bans in place.
So lets make Davis an even nicer place where we arent awakened by leaf blowers, or our morning coffee isnt ruined by a gust of dust caused by a leafblower.

With enough support and likes on this page, we can push city council to enact a city regulation limiting or even better, banning leafblowers from Davis.
  Responses to Points in Favor 
Re: allergies
  I never used to have allergies before Davis and allergies are not coming from leafblowers, they are coming from good old Mother Nature. Theres a little thing called the wind and in Davis dry atmosphere it picks up a lot of dust and pollen. Users/hankim
   RE Well anecdotes shouldnt be used when trying to argue points since they are notoriously unreliable. You should consider instead doing research. Doing a quick google search I was able to find several people claiming there was a Lung Association study on the subject. So instead of take what they say as the truth I did the foot work and looked it up for everyone ( http://www.lungusa.org/associations/states/newyork/pressroom/assets/opedsandletterstonewspapereditors/leafblowerbansaidair.pdf ) and they have concluded that it is a source of air pollution. Just consider how the piece of machinery operations, of course it is kicking up pollutants into our air which could be damaging to our health  its not rocket science. This does not discount that fact that Davis already does have a lot of allergens due to wind pollinated trees such as Walnut  but that doesnt mean that the blowers do not contribute. ~~~Users/upisdown
    Did you include the wrong link here?  That pdf doesnt offer any information on any remotely relevant Lung Association study (I dont think a State of the Air report for Westchester County finding that its smoggy fits the bill).  Its an opinion piece that doesnt even make any real causal claims. Users/TomGarberson
     How is it not relevant? It is a superior of the Lung Association confirming their organization has drawn connections between leaf blowers contribute to air pollution. Here is an article on the specifics: http://www.postgazette.com/pg/10132/1057366109.stm written by two people in related fields describing the results of the Lung Assocation report.
       I didnt say the piece wasnt relevant, I said it doesnt offer information on a relevant Lung Association study.  Because, again, theres no study on health effects cited there, theres detailed information on health effects, and there are certainly no causal claims. tg

Re: Businesses, cars
  I see someone sweeping up the leaves in front of Steves Pizza each morning. Let businesses make their own decisions. And for cars, the leaves and dust do not bother me as much as the tree sap. At least the rain washes off the leaves and dust, but the tree sap never leaves even after heavy scrubbing and commercial removers (might need to actually bother getting a buff and wax at some point), but you dont see me telling the city that we should burn the trees down! No wait...Users/hankim
   RE It is not always wise to let businesses make their own decisions when it comes to the environment because we all share it. We should be careful when we allow businesses to cut corners to increase profits at the cost of all of our health. It is completely rational and shows foresight to use our local politics to make wise decisions to protect our environment. ~~~Users/upisdown

Re: Other communities that enacted a ban
  Sunnyvale has some nice parts of it, but I know for a fact that Los Altos and Palo Alto are very expensive neighborhoods to live in, so what might work over there might now work in most neighborhoods. Users/hankim

   RE You seem to be making a few logical fallacies here, you seem to be suggesting that because Sunnyvale and has no blowers and that it is expensive, so having no blowers means an area is expensive. Therefore if Davis has no blowers it will be expensive. First of all Davis is expensive, and second it is incredibly misleading to suggest that having no blowers is the only factor in the price of housing. The fact that Davis is in the middle of nowhere and the area you mentioned is near the Bay would probably be a bigger factor than leaf blowing. ~~~Users/upisdown
    I think that the implication is that it is a preexisting expensive neighborhood, so the people who live there might be more inclined to pay a premium for the same service. I can guarantee that Davis is not populated by as affluent of people as Sunnyvale (median household income in Sunnyvale is ~$88,000, as opposed to $42,000 in Davis). Users/JoePomidor
     Many are not affluent in Sunnyvale.  Sunnyvale has a number of mobile home parks (Google it).
      I dont think people in mobile home parks will be overly affected by a leaf blower ban. Beyond that, the median income is still very high, which means for every person making, say, $42,000/yr in a mobile home park, there is some other household in the city making $134,000. Popular approval does not mean that everyone agreed, just enough to make it happen.
       Right  so you are proving the point.  A high median can include a lot of variance.  The existence of mobile home parks was just one way of showing that.  I was just responding to the claim that Sunnyvale is affluent; the truth is that parts are and parts arent.
        Exactly how is any of this relevant? It all still assumes that only rich people can afford a ban on using gas powered blowers to move leaves around. It implies there is only one solution and it is costly. That assumption is wrong  there are not only two possible outcomes.
Arguments Against Banning LeafBlowers
Leafblowers can be annoying.  We all agree on that point.  Inconsiderate users who crank them up too high, use them too early/late, or blow stuff at passersby.  The thing is, there are already regulations in place to address these issues.  If those regulations are insufficient, they can be adjusted.  If they arent enforced, A) thats a problem with enforcement, not with the laws themselves, and B) theres nothing to indicate that a ban would be enforced any more effectively.

As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stated, and as several people have paraphrased in this discussion, The right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins.  When removed from its original context, however, that quote can lose the basis for its obvious truth: when I continue to swing my fist past where the other mans nose begins, a very obvious and significant harm results.

The problem many people have with this movement to ban leafblowers is that it hasnt established the harm that makes it wrong to keep on swinging.  The issues concerning proponents of the ban seem to be three: 1) Noise; 2) Pollution; and 3) Health.

 Noise
Some leafblowers are quite noisy, but Davis already has a noise ordinance which puts limits both on hours and on volume.  If the ordinance is inadequate, it can be adjusted to achieve the noiserelated ends of the desired ban.  If it is not enforced, that is something that should be raised with the city and with the police department.  Talk to your elected representatives and public servants about Davis Municipal Code/24.02.020 and Davis Municipal Code/24.02.040 if you dont think theyre doing the trick.

 Pollution
Theres a lot of very damning and very outdated information out there about the pollution emitted by leafblowers.  This is primarily because there doesnt seem to have been much study of the issue since the series of increasingly strict regulations put in place by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  Through a series of three regulations in 1995, 2000, and 2007, gaspowered leafblowers are required to produce 80% less pollution than they typically were prior to 1995.  The 2007 regulation, by the time it goes fully into effect in 20112012 (dates vary depending on the size of the motor), will require an additional 35% reduction over the existing standards.  Electric blowers are cleaner still.  See the http://daviswiki.org/Banning_leafblowers#head3f8b3dbfb5e3945110495580beab7e30a108cc1b Data section above for sources.  If we start with the assumption that a certain amount of emission, when minimized and regulated, is an inevitable and acceptable consequence of modern living, its hard to argue that the pollution emitted by leafblowers isnt being addressed.

Concerned citizens might reasonably advocate for a requirement that landscapers update their equipment to post2000 standards and, within some reasonable period of time after the new regulations go into effect, to post2007 regulation standards.  Doing so would be far less intrusive and ultimately less costly than an outright ban, and it would substantially achieve the same results as to the pollution concern.

 Health
If leafblowers cause significant health issues, thats a very good argument for banning them.  Everyone agrees on that point!  Thus far, however, no one has offered anything resembling data on that point.  Consider this an open invitation: find real informationsay, a study by a reputable sourcethat supports the claim that leafblowers are causing real health problems and post it here.  None of us want to be exposed to dangerous particulates.

However, the fact that a number of intelligent, outspoken, and interested people have argued the issue at some length hereand elsewherewithout pointing to a single tidbit of scientific information on the issue raises the question: is the problem real?

One more thing: we are also near (on all sides) farmland, which is tilled (sending up huge plumes of dust etc) and also there are occasional burn days, which Im sure trounce the air far worse than all the leafblowers combined and doubled...

 Conclusion
Banning private activity is an intrusive and potentially expensive proposition.  Its appropriate when it is necessary to prevent some sort of harm.  The greater the harm, the greater the intrusion and cost that may be justified.  In this case, proponents of the ban have failed to present any real harm that cant be addressed by other, less intrusive and costly methods.  If there is real harmparticularly to our health, as some have claimeda ban may well be appropriate.  Until such harm is demonstrated, though, the logical conclusion remains the one stated by several people in the comments below: proponents want to ban leafblowers because they dont like them.  And thats just not good enough.

Previously Discussed Points
 1. As fun as it is to be authoritarian, there are better ways of dealing with peoples dislike for leafblowers than pass laws telling everyone what they can and cant do.  Actually talking to your neighbors about the problem can go a long way.
 1. Is the city going to buy everyones newlyprohibited gas leafblowers if theyre too loud to operate legally?
 1. There is no nonanecdotal proof that they contribute to asthma, hearing loss or any of the other serious claims. Wind and already existing pollen are a greater factor in asthma, and there is no ban on construction equipment, trains or other, much louder, tools.  Opponents to the ban have pointed out that there is no data supporting the benefits of a ban.  For instance, when other cities have banned gasblowers, there was no drop in asthmarelated hospital visits.
 1. Apartment complexes will pass along the increased cost of maintenance to tenants and raising rents throughout town.  The added cost could be enough to price many lower income residents out of Davis.  From the http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GROUND%20ZERO%20IN%20LEAF%20BLOWER%20BATTLE%20:%20RAKE%20AND%20BROOM%20VS.%20GASPOWERED...a084037667 above link, yard crews found that the landscaping time at single residences increased by roughly 50% in switching over to rake and broom.  Costs will inevitably increase proportionally, and be passed on to renters.  Proponents of the ban spoke with gardeners in their Davis neighborhood and received estimates of $1520 per 2 weeks in increased costs for large apartment complexes translating to $390520 more per year  a significant amount.
 1. They are already illegal if they break the noise regulations.  Enforcement of existing laws would result in the same effect, and adding additional laws would not guarantee enforcement.
 1. A ban on leaf blowers in general will block blowers that alleviate some of the issues (like electric blowers, which are quieter and have a lower ecological impact).
 1. Some yards have delicate plants or exposed root systems that make raking problematic or impossible.  Many types of light ground cover and delicate plants create large areas, such as much of the Arboretum, where raking is impractical because of either damage to the plants or simple difficulty in pulling detritus out of the plants.  Leaf blowers allow for a quick, harmless way of maintaining such areas.  Without them it would take many times longer, and some types of ground cover would even need to be maintained quite literally by hand.
 Response: Harmless? Leaf blowers emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds. Neither of these, which react with sunlight to create harmful groundlevel ozone, is harmless. In addition, leaf blowers stir up particulates  dust containing whoknowswhat, for example  that make breathing difficult for people with asthma and other respiratory problems. response to the response: I believe you go astray when you overlook the fact that harmless is used in the context of it doesnt cause damage where physical agitation (such as raking) would. Also No one doubts running a gas motor creates vocs, but does a modern blower create sketchly large amounts of vocs with nominal use?
 1. A ban on blowers prevents the handicapped and elderly from being independently capable of tending to their own property.  Costs for these people would increase dramatically, since they would be forced to hire landscapers (whose costs would have just gone up by around 50%; see above).
 Response: Do we really want the elderly using gaspowered leaf blowers? That class of citizens is more vulnerable to the pollution caused by leaf blowers and other lawn and garden equipment. As for the physically challenged, the notion of people in wheelchairs traversing their lawns with leaf blowers, or people struggling with canes or other physical supports, while also wielding a leaf blower, is
1. Electric blowers are often also vacuuming mulchers.  Mulch and compost are good, and its hard to get more local than using your own yards products in the yard.

  Responses to Arguments Against 

Re: As fun as it is to be Authoritarian...
  Ignoring that this is a poorly disguised ad hom, we do not live in a libertarian paradise without any regulation. Regulation exist and with good cause, because we do not all live on our own private islands where our actions only effect ourselves. We live in a community where the actions of one on the environment effect everyone around them. This is the entire reason humans decided on creating a civilization and government, so that we can create rules and regulations which we believe are fair, protect the community and benefit the most people at a time. Local government is a rare thing in the sense that you have more power because the number of voters is so much smaller than national elections  so rules created by this system are a result of the closest you will ever get to real democracy and to suggest that is authoritarian is ignorant.
 There have been many necessary regulations put in place to protect the environment because business are not obligated to protect the environment, they are simply obligated to increase profits for share holders. So in our system it is completely rational for them to disregard long term environmental damage for short term profit. That is why we have the checks of regulation against business, so that we can use our foresight to determine long term problems and try to prevent them from happening. Because the profit corporations make on the environment effects everyone. ~~~Users/upisdown
   Youre putting the cart before the horse.  If you want to sell people on the idea, youre going to want to make a case for the notion that leaf blowers are doing some sort of harm before suggesting that they need to be regulated.  People disagreeing with the ban are doing so, for the most part, because no one advocating the ban has offered any evidence that it causes any sort of harm beyond mild annoyance.  Necessary regulations to protect the environment are one thing.  But if you want to use those lines in this context, you first need to establish 1) harm to the environment; 2) that banning leafblowers (particularly just gas ones, as advocated here) would prevent that harm; and 3) theres not another, less restrictive way to prevent the harm.  Otherwise, the regulation is neither necessary, nor is it protecting the environment. Users/TomGarberson
    So you are saying using fossil fuel powered equipment to break up natural ecological processes of recapturing nutrients does not have an effect on the environment? Are you kidding me? Maintaining lawns is incredibly energy costly  and any steps to making this practice more expensive will encourage people to adopt lawns which better reflect the climate they live in  such as drought resistant lawns in deserts. Can I assume you believe in global warming? Also your claim of putting the cart before the horse is wrong, because I was making a rebuttal to the suggestion that regulation is an act monopolized by authoritarian governments (Which was trying to clearly draw negative associations with from authoritarian governments in history; nice use of emotion) . I had to only prove that there are rational reasons for regulation  I had no obligation to argue that leaf blowers was one of them  but I did earlier in this paragraph for your sake. Cheers.
     First, lets differentiate between regulation as a generalization and this regulation.  The point to which you responded was criticizing this proposal for regulation, specifically because of the perception that the true underlying motivation is that some people find leafblowers annoying.  Second, youre getting pretty far off base here.  If you want to ban nonnative plants in landscaping, youre welcome to argue for it, but it has nothing to do with leafblowers.  And third, the global warming argument is pretty darned broad, and ignores the fact that in the past 15 years, the EPA has put regulations in place mandating an 87% reduction in hydrocarbon emissions and an 80% reduction in NOx emissions in leafblowers and other gaspowered gardening equipment.  Theres serious mitigation being done.  If you want to argue that its not enough, thats fine.  But broad, sweeping claims that you dont even tie to this specific issue in a meaningful way dont add anything to the page. Users/TomGarberson

RE: Is the city going to buy the leaf blowers?

  No. Why should they? I dont see how this is an argument against to be honest, it just seems like a poorly thought out question. If you believe in capitalism you should look at this as the market punishing companies for making investments which the citizens think are poor. They should not have invested in to unsustainable technologies and they most certainly should not be compensated for it.
   A ban on leaf blowers is not a market effect.  Many people in Davis have invested in lawful, practical equipment for home improvement which you are saying should no longer be lawful to use.  Its taking away a right and, in a practical sense, its taking away property.
   Hows regulating gas powered leaf blowers the same as taking them away from you? Youre allowed to possess firearms in Davis city limits, however youre not allowed to discharge them within city limits and yet, no one has taken them away from you. Please reconsider the above claim as the tenuous logical leap is not justified.

RE: There is no nonanecdotal proof that they contribute to asthma 

  This is either an out right lie or a lack of research because there is and the research was done by the Lung Association. It seems there is only anecdotal evidence saying there is no problem. You should consider doing research before typing with such certainty. Doing a quick google search I was able to find several people claiming there was a Lung Association study on the subject. So instead of take what they say as the truth I did the foot work and looked it up for everyone ( http://www.lungusa.org/associations/states/newyork/pressroom/assets/opedsandletterstonewspapereditors/leafblowerbansaidair.pdf ) and they have concluded that it is a source of air pollution. Just consider how the piece of machinery operations, of course it is kicking up pollutants into our air which could be damaging to our health  its not rocket science. Users/upisdown
   Youre citing to an oped (translation: opinion/editorial) piece that makes no health claims, much less causal claims, much less causal claims that in any way invoke a scientific study. Users/TomGarberson

RE: Apartments will pass along the costs

  First of all you are assuming that there would have to be additional costs. Instead of paying landscapers apartments could use the grass areas to plant community gardens  apartment complexes have MANY options. You are suggesting that we have two options: expensive apartments with no blowers or cheap apartments with blowers. That clearly is a false assessment of the possible situations. In fact the legislators could add provisions to protect landowners from doing that. This is local politics, your say has more of an effect on this than any other form of governmental politics. You could always voice your concern and try to help shape the law. Users/upisdown
   This is a practical discussion.  There are dozens of apartment complexes in Davis with grass areas, trees, etc.  The cost of replacing all of that would be substantial.  Theres also the fact that some people like having grass areas.  What youre suggesting again has little to do with the proposal to ban leafblowers and its effects on realworld Davis.  Its a side issue.
  Why are we still maintaining lawns anyways? What is the obsession with old European standards of landscape beauty which are clearly unsustainable in our environment since we dont have the same climate these rules were developed.

RE: We already have noise violation laws

  That still does not address the health concerns. Or environmental concerns from use of oil.
   What health concerns?  There hasnt been any information provided on this page which suggests theyre anything more than concerns. If there were serious data supporting a causal link between leafblowers and significant health problems, opponents of a ban would be approaching this very differently.  Many peoples negative reaction is due to the fact that the principal reason for banning blowers appears to be dislike.  No one has added any actual information on health effects, making that point seem suspiciously like pretense. Users/TomGarberson

RE: A Ban on leaf blowers could affect electric blowers

  This is local politics. Your voice is more significant here than on any other level of government. If you are afraid to ban gas blowers because electric blowers are good you could voice this and affect the policy. However using this as a way to protect gas blowers is disingenuous. Users/upisdown
   This is a straw man.  No one made a claim that a ban on leaf blowers could effect electric blowers.

RE: Raking can be bad for certain plants

  Well removing leaf litter in general is bad for plants (Unless it is blocking light). This material would normally be broken down and then reused by the plant. Using incredible amounts of energy to move this leaf litter to a different area to be decomposed so it can be wrapped up in plastic and shipped back to be used as soil amendment is wasteful. Leaf blowers also have negative impacts of plants by removing potentially beneficial insects or pollinators. Users/upisdown
 hmmm I think that specific point was aimed at parts of the arbo where we are talking about exposed root systems, in that case I dont think wet decaying biologically active stuff on top of them is necessarily the best thing for them...
    Please cite research backing the above claim that leaf matter harms exposed root systems. Otherwise, remove the claim.

RE: Bans would prevent the elderly from working on their own landscapes

  So wait you are saying old people can carry heavy engines on their backs and blow leaves around but they cant lift a rake? This is just absurd. You are really grasping. Maybe they should keep landscaping they are capable of taking care of, or talk to neighbors to get help or pay people. We shouldnt continence trump our collective space. Users/upisdown
   Most leafblowers weigh between 2.7 and 5.5kg (http://www.targetwoman.com/articles/leafblower.html source), and many have a shoulder strap or something of the sort. They dont require bending or pulling. They have a minimal effect on balance, unlike raking. They can be used from wheel chairs or walkers. The same cannot be said of a rake.
     Do we really want the elderly using gaspowered leaf blowers? That class of citizens is more vulnerable to the pollution caused by leaf blowers and other lawn and garden equipment. As for the physically challenged, the notion of people in wheelchairs traversing their lawns with leaf blowers, or people struggling with canes or other physical supports, while also wielding a leaf blower, would be laughable if it werent so ridiculous Users/SteveDavies

RE: But leaves make mulch and compost

  Using incredible amounts of energy to move this leaf litter to a different area to be decomposed so it can be wrapped up in plastic and shipped back to be used as soil amendment is wasteful. There are much better alternatives. Reading through your reasoning I question if you are able to see more than two possibilities for any given problem.Users/upisdown
   Another straw man.  The point on the list to which youre responding refers to leaf vacuuming for composting/mulching in your own yard.  Additionally, youre mistaken in assuming that the arguments against a ban are the reasoning of any one person.
   Theres no indication that the leaves are even leaving the property, why would you make that assumption? There are plenty of people who work on their own yards with their own equipment. Beyond that, why do you feel a need to revert to ad hom attacks? You can respond to an argument without insulting the person making it.

Re: Leaf blowers allow for a quick, harmless way of maintaining such areas.

    Harmless? Leaf blowers emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides and Volatile Organic Compounds. Neither of these, which react with sunlight to create harmful groundlevel ozone, is harmless. In addition, leaf blowers stir up particulates  dust containing whoknowswhat, for example  that make breathing difficult for people with asthma and other respiratory problems.

Dont know where to put this data, but here is a list of cities that have leaf blower bans (found http://www.nonoise.org/quietnet/cqs/other.htm here) and the associated median household incomes (from Wikipedia): Belvedere ($130k), Berkeley ($57k), Beverly Hills  (N/A), Carmel ($58), Claremont ($113k), Del Mar  ($81k), Indian Wells ($94k), Laguna Beach ($90k), Los Altos ($158k), Malibu ($102k), Mill Valley ($90k), Piedmont ($134k), Santa Monica ($71k), Hermosa Beach ($81k), West Hollywood ($39k), Palo Alto ($119k), Portola Valley ($244k), and Sunnyvale($88k).

20101018 19:07:37 nbsp As a NYer (Upstate)Im going to comment here. While I respect the idea of the position, I think this is total overkill. I have a lawn maintenance man for our home where if he used the rake it would take him LONGER to cleanup then using the leafblowers. Tell meare you going to try to ban the WIND when it blows up dust??? During the summer here pollen covers our cars/patios and drives our allergies insane...sorry friendsI think this is going way way too far. Best of luck though Users/PeterBoulay
  I agree. If you really care about leafblowers this much, pay your gardener extra to use a rake or petition your complex to pay their maintenance people extra to rake the property (have fun with increases to rent). Hell, take it up with your homeowners association. If a specific neighborhood wants to ban leafblowers, go right on ahead. Unless of course, that is too much trouble for you and you would prefer the government to force everyone to go your way? Users/hankim

20101018 20:06:00 nbsp Leaf blowers are usually not used after hours and large areas could be covered in a matter of minutes (as opposed to raking...). If I rake my yard it would take 3540 minutes while blowing takes only 34 minutes. The noise produced is limited and transient and occurs only during the daytime.  If you have issues with dust, perhaps you should not live in a dry, hot climate.  Users/path

20101018 21:46:43 nbsp Wind is not the same as leafblowers. Leafblowers generate directional and inaccurate airflow of very high strength lifting up particulate. Wind in the other hand is sweeping (sideways motion) which while it does lift some dust, it not even close to a leaf blower. I constantly use a rake in my property and it takes only about 10% extra time. If anything, we should at least ban gas leafblowers. Maybe leave some hours open during weekdays at a certain distance from residential areas for electric leafblowers. I think its a good idea and long overdue. Users/amesguich
  Again this is ludicrous and Ill support those who oppose this. I spoke to 5 lawn maintenance folks working our street today and all of them absolutely laughed at this idea. They raking takes them a lot more then 10% extra time....Users/PeterBoulay
   Then they should all charge by their time spent rather than by the job.  If it were outlawed then all of the maintenance folks would be in the same boat and none would have an advantage over the others.  And you know what?  It would be healthier for them, too.  Users/CovertProfessor
     The problem with charging by time spent is that when it comes to things like raking leaves, people would be paid the same no matter how productive or efficient they actually are. Jobs that are salarybased usually require people to finish tasks by a certain deadline and they might even end up finishing work overnight in order to keep their jobs. If someone were to be paid by the hour for raking leaves, taking two hours to finish the job would be more beneficial for the worker (promoting inefficiency). In a system that pays for a task finished, it is most beneficial for the worker to finish up and move on to the next client as quickly as possible (promoting efficiency). Users/hankim

Also wet leaves on pavement and sidewalks in the fall are a hazard and liability.

     Well, Davis has Californiasized lawns  tiny by East Coast standards.  So, neighbors are very much affected by sound and by particles.

At 100 ft the sound is still around some 6080 decibels. If it were rock music playing at the same volume and time the police would need to be called! It makes things (cars, windows, bikes, the air) filthy as it kicks up the dust, chemical, allergen, dander cocktail around our houses (much more than the wind which patterns in a particular area). We live in tight quarters in this town and maybe a little bit of regulation here, say perhaps hour and day restrictions is something that makes sense for Davis.

  If any, the hike in price will be really small. Maybe a gardener will charge an extra $20 for large apartment complexes worse case scenario. This will especially not affect apartment complexes, as the price gets split among the units. Many landlords wont even bother raising the rent any more than they do yearly. In the big picture of what it costs to maintain a building, this price increase, if any is insignificant to the landlord. Users/amesguich
   $20 per what?  Week?  Month?  Year?  Do you have a basis for that figure?  Do you know what a normal price is perworkerhour for landscaping/yard work?  I certainly dont, but I assume you have some basis for deciding on the $20 figure.
   According to the article Users/DonShor posted, the gardeners said they would have to charge $50 more a month from the initial price of $75 a month. Your numbers seriously look madeup. Users/hankim
    Going from 23 to 34 minutes for a standard gardening job is pretty hefty.  Proportionally, I would expect to see more like a 50% increase in cost (reflecting the 50% increase in time), or a raise of $3035 on that base cost.  Either way, I think its hard to argue that the cost is truly insignificant or that it wouldnt be passed on to tenants.  Whether its an extra $240 per year (amesguichs figure, assuming (s)he meant monthly) or an extra $600 per year (gardeners estimate), and regardless of your income level, there is a significant cost involved.  I wouldnt be surprised if the $20/month extra was a reasonable figure for a renter in an apartment complex.  Note that Im not commenting on whether its worth the added cost; Im just saying, it will have an impact on rental costs. Users/TomGarberson

    You did not specify where you got your information from and you did not even mention a time frame. Makes the numbers hard to believe.

  amesguich: thats nice you asked yours and your neighbors gardner, I am sure they represent all landscapers. A reasonable guess doesnt start out with Many landlords wont even bother raising the rent, rather, you start by saying in my opinion (not an educated guess either, as a hypothesis assumes independent, verifiable, data exists). I am not splitting hairs. I am questioning your reasoning. Who the hell are to you to set a limit at $100; some people live paychecktopaycheck, any increase means less food. What, if your mortgage goes up $10, no matter what I would recommend that YOU relocate. It sickens me, the kinds of blase attitude people have towards pricing others out of the market.

  @BB: I did not write that, read carefully. I said that those are the estimates I got for two large apartment complexes. Why would you attack me personally? I know what increase in costs mean to people. I come from a poor background. But I am paying my rent every month, as well as my taxes, and as you do, I have some rights.

Street sweepers are necessary once in a while and cant really be replaced by mop and bucket (be reasonable). Thats why banning leafblowers. How the specific regulation will go is up to city council.

20101021 17:31:13 nbsp Is the city going to refund people who have purchased leaf blowers?

Also Im sick of people going through city laws rather than dealing with their neighbors.  Cant you just ASK them to stop if its bothering you or work out another time of the day?  Heaven forbid we interact with others.  9 times out of 10 I havent had a problem when I do request some consideration.  As for the other 10% of the time...you cant ban people from being assholes in this world.  You can just try to be a bigger one  oh wait, I guess thats what this is about (Har) Users/OliviaY
  Since we dont live in a utopia every person we deal with is not a rational person capable of reason. Or what if they are a business and they have to weight making money or not annoying you  sorry but they are going to choose make a profit every time because you dont pay them and that is completely rational for them to do so. That is the whole point of having local government is so that we can come together and discuss things and try to make policies with foresight that benefit the most people possible.

20101021 23:13:16 nbsp While I understand all of the arguments found in these comments, I just wanted to say that most leaf blowers I have passed while biking to and from school have always diverted their blowing ways away from me, or paused the action, to allow me to pass. There have been few incidences when this doesnt happen, and its usually because they dont see me.

Also, I dont own a leaf blower. I cant afford one. So I rake, or I dont and my lawn dies a little. Sometimes theyre used in the arboretum (mostly, in the special collection gardens)  and I ask you this, have YOU ever tried raking leaves from little delicate plant collections and ground covers that get torn up with the effort of raking but die under the leaves left? Id love to get paid more to hand pick them all out ... but I dont get paid. I volunteer, and our little group has a lot of work to do. Additionally, the few women who do get paid have a lot of arboretum to cover (and its not as if the University is ever likely to pay them more to hand rake).

While I have been woken as a poor, studying student by apartment complex gardening activities in the past, I never failed my classes because of it and my asthma has never been affected. Now, if you ask me about olives in bloom, my asthma doesnt like that  but Im not about to ask for a ban on olive trees.  Users/ChristyMarsden
 Ill hazard a guess that a city ban on leafblowers wouldnt even affect the University unless they wanted to adopt a similar policy to be neighborly.  Its very true, thoughtrying to rake around fragile plants (especially under coastal redwoods... grew up with those in the back yard) is a big challenge.  A lot of the time, you might as well do it by hand. Users/TomGarberson

As to the comments here that are trying to make the issue of banning leaf blowers into a joke by mocking the very idea, the fact is that many cities have taken this issue quite seriously.  And this problem is not unique to Davis nor is it new.
This from the Los Angeles Times July 4, 1997:  Concerned about noise and air pollution, Los Angeles last week joined more than 40 California cities in restricting gaspowered leaf blowers. In one of the most aggressive local laws, Los Angeles enacted an outright ban on the blowers within 500 feet of any residence. Offendersgardeners and homeownerscan be fined up to $1,000 or sent to jail for as long as six months.
Do this Google search cities banning leaf blowers and youll find lots of information.  For example, here it is a link to a Sacramento organization http://www.nonoise.org/quietnet/cqs/other.htm  They list the California cities with a leaf blower ban and how well theyre working.  If other cities are able to make a ban work, why cant Davis?
 Users/AnnieOakley

   AnnieOakley: You know when you ask people to do a Google search, you shouldnt expect those people to seek the same confirmation bias you find. Santa Barbra still has people breaking the law, using gas mowers, because of the issues cited above. Cities that have banned blowers are no less air polluted than those without the ban, look at the DATA, those cities have no less asthmarelated hospital visits as those without. A ban means a way for local government to extort money by their people by force. Our prison population is already too high, are you advocating to put people behind bars for blowing air? It COSTS money, you advocate to push that cost on others because of YOUR distaste to a loud noise. You wish to enforce behavior through legislation, did prohibition stop people from drinking will a prohibition on gas blowers stop people form using them? No. You just wish to punish people for their market choices, to push people out of a housing market, and for what and for who? Instead of asking people to search, how about you do your own damn homework and provide evidence.   Users/BobBlumenfields

20101026 27:25:00 nbsp I do work, 2 jobs, and I study fulltime. I try my best to study at home so I at least get to be home a bit, but Its nearly impossible with leafblowers for hours every weekday afternoon and some mornings very early. I work until late many days, and leafblowers at 7am arent fun. I tried talking to the neighbors and they said that their landscapers/gardeners are the ones who decide what to use. So I talked to the gardenersa couple of weeks ago, and again this week: Some rudely ignored me, one said he would try to make it quick, but no change in the last week, he still takes his time and even blows leafs that endup falling in our patio. Maybe other people will have better luck using that approach. I didnt and find the existing regulations insufficient so Im supporting a ban/tougher regulation.

20101027 11:48:08 nbsp Here is a link to a documented study by the Orange County grand jury who gathered information from a variety of sources for those of you who may be interested.  In addition to health concerns, it addresses the issues of economics and compliance.
www.ocgrandjury.org/pdfs/leafblow.pdf

Here is the summary:

The widespread daily usage of twocycle gasoline engine leaf blowers in the cities
and unincorporated areas presents a health hazard to all citizens of Orange County.
The hazards are fourfold:

· Toxic exhaust fumes and emissions are created by gaspowered leaf blowers.
Exhaust pollution per leaf blower per hour is the equivalent of the amount of smog
from 17 cars driven one hour and is localized in the area of blower usage.

· The highvelocity air jets used in blowing leaves whip up dust and pollutants.
The particulate matter (PM) swept into the air by blowing leaves is composed of dust,
fecal matter, pesticides, fungi, chemicals, fertilizers, spores, and street dirt which
consists of lead and organic and elemental carbon. About five pounds of PM per leaf
blower per hour are swept into the air and take hours to settle.

· The quantity of pollution products that are injected into county air.
The total amount of pollutants injected into the environment by blower usage in the
county is significant. The ARB calculates that leaf blowers inject 2.11 tons of
combustion pollutants per day into Orange County air. Leaf blowers in the County
sweep twenty tons per day of small size particulate matter into the air.

· Blower engines generate high noise levels.
Gasolinepowered leaf blower noise is a danger to the health of the blower operator
and an annoyance to the nonconsenting citizens in the area of usage.

In light of the evidence, the Grand Jury determined the health hazards citizens are
exposed to by the use of leaf blowers outweigh the questionable economic benefit
blowers may bring to the cities and the County. The Grand Jury recommends that the
cities, school districts, community college districts, and the County cease using gas
powered blowers in their maintenance and cleanup operations.

This report also points out that children are the most vulnerable to the pollution and noise caused by leaf blowers.

 Users/AnnieOakley

  Where to start? First of all, a Grand Jury is hardly any sort of authoritative source. Whats the old saying, a good lawyer can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich? Grand juries are usually just a bunch of citizens that volunteered for grand jury duty.  As to the harm of noise, 2 stroke engines and dust, I spent lots of my youth riding trail bikes an working on farms experiencing all of that.  No harm, no issue.  Are leaf blowers a bit annoying?  Yeah, sure.  Are they going to make you sick and deaf?  I hardly think so.  users/jimstewart

20101102 08:17:15 nbsp It appears to me that several of the cities mentioned that have a ban are likely dominated by evergreen rather than deciduous trees. I can go with raking leaves in the desert or less shade tree environs. Here, we have a fall and a significant leaf drop. I have several large trees that are several feet in diameter and use a big rake on the lawn, and an electric blower for the patios and walks;I have a heavier gas one that is not as effective and is more of a pain it sits in the garage. I know my electric one will burn out eventually, the last 2 did as well (theres another waste of resources) which is why I bought the gas one. I use the blower at times when I think it is least likely to be bothering my neighbors. I dont do it when I know it is going to blow dust back on me or anyone else. I also use it on the roof to get leaves off cant really rake that effectively. There is a place for both tools. My immediate neighbors (to the left, right, and across the street) hire 2 landscape companies to care for their yards. They come do it one time per week. Someone who said every day above, well I dont believe you.   Ive already taken down one large magnificent tree because it was a mess to keep clean, it provided great shade. If Davis bans blowers, Ill be taking 2 more down. Raking is more timeconsuming, no question. Lastly, Im more annoyed by the city street sweeper that comes before 7:00am (which I understand is illegal) and occurs before many of the cars on the street have left for work what a waste of city resources as they are not sweeping the gutters etc.  Richardl Users/RichardL

20101103 09:43:38 nbsp Make the law fit the problem. For instance, if the noise is the issue make the law require quieter blowers of whatever technology is used. If the problem is the pollution, address that. If the issue is blown up dust, address that. Users/SteveDavison
  Some of those laws would effectively ban leafblowers: you can only make a motor so quiet, and theres really no way to blow the leaves around without kicking up dust. Users/JoePomidor

20101103 09:47:15 nbsp Part of the problem is how we view nature and leaves itself. Why do we insist on getting ride of the leaves? There are no leaf blowers in the wild. There havent been any for the last, er, billion years and weve done fine. Why not just leave the leaves? Everything is a resource. Users/SteveDavison
  A thick blanket of leaves can easily kill a lawn, and a wet one can turn pavement slippery. Unfortunately, we live in an unnatural world, so there are some aspects that natural solutions simply cannot address.Users/JoePomidor
    Perhaps there should be a movement to ban lawns... Users/SteveDavison
      Thats not uncommon, especially in locales that lack a sufficient supply of water.  What tends to actually be passed are something along the line of tax credits for not having a lawn and using wiki:wikipedia:xeriscaping (the Wikipedia article is a bit misleading  xeriscaping in Florida, for instance, means lots of ferns and moss; theres loads of water available, youre just trying to avoid constant irrigation due to the traditional flat grass lawns tendency to lose water).  Davis has the creepy/wonderful moist valley soil, so I dont know how xeriscaping would look locally; Don might know. jw
  http://www.finegardening.com/howto/articles/improvesoilrakeless.aspx  Of course, to achieve the proper pulverizing of the leaves, youll have to use a power mower. But the leaves themselves are not harmful if reincorporated naturally in most cases. Walnut leaves may be an exception. In most cases leaves could be allowed to naturally decompose on site, rather than being hauled off to landfills. Users/DonShor

20101103 10:38:59 nbsp Rights dont exist by themselves. In other words, one persons right to smoke is anothers right to breath fresh air. Ones right to hit another is their right to not be hit. Ones right to peace and quiet is anothers right to make noise. The right to pour waste into the water (or air) goes against the right to get unpolluted water (or air). People who choose to live in cities must accept restrictions on what they could do in less populated areas. Moreso in apartment complexes, lessso in rural neighborhoods. But at some point we all live on the same planet, so we all must live with some restrictions. So its not about having or loosing a right, its about balancing interests of different people and finding a way to live together. Users/SteveDavison
  Absolutely.  But many, even in the Peoples Republic of Davis, feel that excessive regulation of an individuals activities is striking the wrong balance when it comes to those interests.  Davis has a long history of excessive regulation.  See, for example, the recently repealed, unconstitutional Davis Municipal Code/26.01.010 which prohibited being annoying.  As you said, there are certain restrictions that come with living in a a city.  But there are also certain annoyances inherent in such places with which we all must live.  Those seeking to live in peaceful silence probably shouldnt move to a community with more than 60,000 people, crisscrossed by two freeways, train tracks, and numerous major roads, and home to a bustling economy and major university.  Leafblowers are being targeted here because people find them annoying.  Hell, I find them annoying, too.  But sometimes, the right solution is not to ban the things that are annoying. Users/TomGarberson
   Hey TomIm annoyed by the train tracks behind my house...even though I chose to live here I think we should ban them. (/sarcasm off)
    Well trains are not really comparable to gas powered blowers considering they have entirely different purposes. There seems like quite a bit of circle jerking going on in a few of these comment threads.
     By the way leaves are recycled into fertilizer when our town takes them away.  Users/PeterBoulay
        Technically, DWR chips and composts all green waste, not just leaves.  Kind of a pain when the wind hits them, as they dont allow bags. I remember seeing 8th just east of Pole Line carpeted with leaves because it was windy just before they did pickup.    jw

In my neighborhood there are several singlestory apartments. They have different owners, which means different groundskeepers, and they each operate on a different day (by law!), so for 3 hours/day on 3 days of the week its so loud I cant hear myself think and cant get anything done.

20101208 12:46:35 nbsp Okay I have 2 points to make:

1) Are we going to ban vacuum cleaners too? They can get pretty annoying if your neighbors are using them at annoying hours. Can we ban loud cars too? I live on a corner next to a 4 way stop sign intersection and we get people driving past at all hours of the day and night blasting loud music, and also driving loud cars just to prove that they can drive loud cars (i.e. being douchebags).

2) I raked my entire lawn in like half an hour the other night, and I made 4 HUGE piles of leaves on the curb. I took breaks to play with my rubber band airplane between raking and I still got it done pretty fast. It was not difficult. Also, I did it at midnight. Could you do that with a leaf blower? No, your neighbors would kill you.

In summary: Quit yer bitchin. Who cares if you can use a leaf blower or not? Users/JenniferCook
    BRAVO!!! Well written!!! PeteB
    You do realize that loud cars are banned, right? (And for good reason  read the municipal code) Sjoe
    Yup they would however I would like to point out MY experiences raking.  I lived in a house where I was subletting for a few months with my dog.  The tree in the backyard was a nuisance in that the leaves were obscenely STICKY.  Raking was a godawful pain because half the time the leaves were stuck to the rake and I would have to remove them.  Cutting down the tree was not an option.  Know what did get the leaves up in 1/10th of the time?  The gardening service that used a leaf blower that came once a week.  Oh and people who are bitching might also be folk who really dont have even half an hour to spare in their weeks because they are working two jobs or people have already spent a great deal of money to buy their leaf blower. I would imagine considering the investment, the latter would very much Care if they can use a leaf blower. OliviaY
