Locally, this is the lovely art of food cooked on a hot grillFootnote(People from regions where barbeque means slow cooking in a low temperature should keep in mind that most que in California is not barbeque at all, but rather grilled meat with sauce, usually Texan or sweet Texan.  Pits are hard to find, and the wide range of sauces typically found on the table in restaurants on the east coast (eastern North Carolinas sweet vinegar, South Carolina mustard based, St. Louis tomato and spices) appear to be utterly absent from the state.  As a result of the confusion between grilling and barbeque, standard fare such as smoked pulled pork (as opposed to roasted pulled pork) or burnt ends are very hard to find.  Keep in mind that in many places where que is king, the best local burritos are at Taco Bell... so enjoy the local fare, and feel bad for the people from Davis who are sitting in Tennessee, staring at a chalupa and trying in vain to explain to the locals that it isnt really Mexican.). Charcoal, gas, Wiki events, or just takeout, heres where you can go locally for your BBQ fix.

Supplies
Food and charcoal for your own grilling can be found at most supermarkets, while grills and propane can be found at Ace Hardware Davis Ace (some gas stations also feature a propane tank exchange).

Regulations
Few pastimes exist that are not subject to government interference and BBQ grilling is no exemption. Dwellers of single family homes and duplexes are largely left unscathed by the fire marshal, however those in multiplefamily dwellings (apartments, condos, townhouses, etc.) are subject to several regulations as of January 1, 2008:
  No grill may be operated on a combustible balcony or within 10 of combustible construction, unless the entire structure is equipped with an automatic fire sprinkler system. (IFC 308.3.1)
  Propane tanks larger than 2.5 lbs (camp stove size) may not be stored or operated on a combustible balcony or within 10 of combustible construction, even if fire sprinklers are present. (IFC 308.3.1.1)
  You may store a charcoal grill on a balcony or next to a building if the grill is not being used.
  You may store a propane grill on a balcony or next to a building if the grill is not being used and the propane tank is stored elsewhere.
These state fire codes effectively prevent most apartment dwellers from operating a BBQ grill with any sort of open flame. Electric BBQ grills are an alternative, although they take longer and food doesnt taste as good. While there is no provision specifically pertaining to BBQ grills in the Davis Model Lease, many apartment complexes have their own rules that ban outdoor grills altogether.
