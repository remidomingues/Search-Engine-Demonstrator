20081229 10:32:16 nbsp Was open this morning.  Had a breakfast burrito minus sausage.  Not too bad for the price, though the salsa tastes like Pace picante sauce.  The coffee, however, was excellent, at least as an iced Americano.  Obviously a new operation, but lots of potential. Users/IAmNewHere

20090102 13:32:32 nbsp Without the dance music and TV, it might actually be a cozy little cafe. Ill keep peeking in :) Users/JohnQ

20090102 14:59:31 nbsp Looking forward to seeing this place develop into a comfortable cafe. When I checked it out this morning the techno was a little overpowering, and the TV would have been distracting had I stayed. Users/NoraCary

20090111 20:57:00 nbsp This is my new favorite coffee shop! The owners are really cool and friendly and they always have Discovery channel on the TV (which I love) and the hot caramel is out of this world! I highly recommend checking out this new familyowned shop. Support local businesses!!! Users/Cole

20090112 14:16:08 nbsp This place has the best coffee in town!! Hands down!! My boyfriend and I went here to try it out last week and now we have come back almost everyday.  He always gets their hot chocolate and says its the best he has ever had.  I love their mochas, iced, frozen, or hot.  The place is also family owned and sometimes their kids are in the store.  Support the family owned business.  The prices are the same as other coffee places in town, and the place is never too busy.  Its worth coming here!!  They also have these new cards, when you buy 9 coffees you get 1 free.  Check it out! Users/JessicaAdams

20090114 03:23:53 nbsp Was in the cafe after 6pm, great location, and very friendly people, I had a panini sandwich and the Barista special yogurt (yogurt with a shot of espresso) both the items were excelent and it was very nice that they have wireless I would diffinetly come back Users/Glady

20090119 19:40:09 nbsp Wonderful coffee, great service and a quiet place to study. Couldnt be happier to have them open. :)
 Users/chellebelle1685

20090126 21:03:25 nbsp Their coffee especially iced coffee is very good.  Their little pies look amazing (havent had one yet, but come in flavors like curry potato and spinach feta).  I liked the cozy atmosphere, especially the refreshing lack of cliche Jazz music playing.  Just an all around good place with very friendly service! Users/epochrpg

20090127 00:36:06 nbsp where are you coffee snob?!?! Users/StevenDaubert
   I am here. Ive only been able to visit once, but I havent been compelled to try again. The owners were very nice and they have very nice food to eat. Their espresso was undrinkable (both espresso and cappuccino), I give it a D. But again, this is just based on one tasting. Further tastings are required for me to give a definitive opinion, but I do not expect the grade to improve. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis
   Thanks for the review, CoffeeSnob. I was wondering about the quality of the coffee, thinking to read some reviews before investing. Now, am imbibing Mishkas lattes till you get to go again and do your famous tastetest. Users/SecretAgentMan

20090129 12:04:00 nbsp My wife and I had the pleasure of eating at this place yesterday and it was one the best cafe experiences weve had.  To begin, when we entered the shop we were greeted by the friendly warm smiles of the owners which is a welcome sight compared to one of the big chain coffee shops.  We ordered the house special which was a 3 meat and cheese panini sandwitch with all the fixings and a side salad.  It was one of the tastiest sandwiches I had eaten in a long time and I was actually thinking about ordering one to go.  I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice that is squeezed to order.  It very sweet and tasty.  My wife order a strawberry smoothie and said it was better then Jamba Juice.  For desert I had the chocolate peanut butter dream bar (DELICIOUS) and my wife had the gourmet orange chocolate chip cookie, which was the zise of a dinner plate and tasted devine.
We are so glad we found Barista Brew cafe and recommend this great place to everyone we meet.  Thanks Paul, Nikki, Rohit and Bobby for opening Barista Brew!  We love it! Users/Kiwikid

20090129 15:18:46 nbsp This is a great little place. I went in yesterday morning and this morning and the (owner?) recognized me and thats nice to have a more personal experience like that. The coffee is perfectly brewed and it was just a nice, refreshing experience.  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090206 20:51:51 nbsp Went tonight with the fiancee to do some studying. Loved the cozy chairs and the coffee was delicious. Fiancee said the mocha he got was good, nothing special, but the fresh baked chocolate chip cookie was great. Owners were very nice. I will definitely be returning to try some pastries and perhaps lunch.  Users/EricaMacGregor

20090219 13:39:20 nbsp i went here today. i know many of the reviews here are good. but i am a person of color and i dont want to say anything. but this particular day the owners/workers (?) were kind of rude. well the woman was not rude, she was pleasant. my friend and i ordered back to back, iced teas...her raspberry, me pomegranate. she got hers made right away as she ordered, he made hers. but he never started mine and then 2 customers show up behind me. ok i dont mind only 2 people working and have to deal w/ others ive worked in places like this....he totally forgets my drink and gets the 2 customers theirs before me and tells me to wait. i waited, felt uncomfortable but waited patiently. then i went to check and dude is like, oh im making a sandwich, just wait time goes by and my friends start thinking something that u shouldnt think about a place in davis. finally he gets my drink says its raspberry but i told him i didnt order that, but then he said it was pomegranate and chuckles saying, oh we had to make another batch of it... and it was hot, with ice in it....(insert straight faced look). places in davis should not make you feel uncomfortable. and this was just my experience. im not starting anything.

i would try it again just to see if it was just a misunderstanding, but looking the owner or worker in the face, just tells me something is very off. but to make sure i may go back so that i wont have to keep this review and be a person who only went once. and the iced tea was not very good in my opinion. Users/KimberlyMiller

20090220 19:20:12 nbsp I like to try different coffee houses in Davis and like to read up on them before I go in. I saw great comments on this particular coffee shop until I got to the bottom of the page, which made me upset because I am a person of color myself. So i said to myself now I really have to go and visit this place. So I went in around 10:30am the coffee shop was busy and there was two customers ahead of me. The man at the register greeted me (He seemed friendly) I ordered a latte and a breakfast bagel and I asked to hold the sausage and he told me it will take about 7 minute..... My food came out in a timely manner and the same person who took my order brought it out to me and he said that he apologized for the wait because they had a presentation there today at the last minute and could not call addition help in... so I started asking him if he worked yesterday and he replied yes and that he worked all day yesterday (Him and his wife). All I can say is if it was that same person which he did say that he and his wife was the only one who worked there all day, i had a great experience I did not see no issue with my color or race. It was a relief because I live in Davis and I would hate to see new businesses coming in and ruining the reputation of Davis has being prejudice Users/Marcia
   Thats really funny because I didnt know Davis had a good reputation about these kinds of things. In fact, Im pretty sure the police dept has a spotty history with profiling. Ive also personally had more random acts of assholery aimed at me for no apparent reason in the 1.5 years that Ive lived here compared to the 23 years Ive lived in San Jose, San Diego, and working in San Francisco. But, I have never had a bad experience at Barista Brew Cafe. Users/KellyM

20090221 12:39:38 nbsp well marcia, may i ask what race you are?? i am dark skinned. i dont know if you are as well. but i meant no harm with my comment, that is why i said i shall go back a 2nd time just to make sure it was no misunderstanding. and the person who was acting funny was the server Rohit. the girl bobbi was very very kind and smiling. i dont want to comment badly about anyones business if they have not done anything wrong. and being a person of color is one thing, but being a person of color who is darker is something else. no offense to you or anyone. i will be going back to see if the treatment is different. im a person who is willing to get to the bottom of things and to correct what ive said if i was wrong.  Users/KimberlyMiller

20090222 12:32:32 nbsp I have been to Barista Brew twice now and love the place. Very friendly and conversational baristas. My friend and I have worked as baristas ourselves for over three years and thus are more picky about our coffee drinks. These guys know how to foam milk! Yes! And their espresso is tasty too! I also went in to try their breakfast and got the breakfast bagel, tasty and cheap! Quiet, clean and comfortable.  Users/Jennyk

20090228 11:22:35 nbsp OK, ive been looking for a new place to study for a long time. In the 4 years i have been in davis, i have never been better greeted by a coffee shop than at Barista. They have amazing fresh squeezed orange juice, great caramel macchiato, delicious grilled chicken sandwiches and are very friendly people. Me an my friends study there an average of 5 hours every time we go, several times a week, and we always get amazing service, they even go out of their way to hook my internet retarded computer to a Ethernet cable. We have had great conversations with the owners and i feel truly welcomed here. I think the race card some commenter used is funny, since the owners are themselves a minority. They know their customers very well, and if you return there often, they will even have your drink ready when they see you arrive through the window!!! I give this new coffee shop a great deal of admiration for their great customer service and their very diverse menu!!
I definitely recommend you guys trying this out!! Users/cndavid

20090228 12:51:13 nbsp Easily my favorite coffee shop in Davis. The owners are very welcoming and friendly. They often are kind enough to pass out delicious samples of their frozen yougurt. They may take a little longer but the coffee and espresso drinks are well worth the wait. The sandwhiches are delicious and well worth the price. I have yet to order anything here that I have not been satisfied and have easily ordered over 30 drinks from here. The owners are always friendly and if you come enough and talk to them they will even greet you by name. I think it is a little crazy that someone wants to immediately pull out the race card because their service was a little slow. I have been to basically every other place in Davis, this place always has space to sit down and provide a conducive environment to enjoy your drink and study.
 Users/DanM

20090305 15:57:47 nbsp i think who says that race card is funny is ill educated. these people are minorities, of indian descent, south asian. in case u did not know, there was a caste system there. go crack open a book. it is possible that many people are capable of racism or discrimination. And if you were in my skin, then youd knw what i was talking about. otherwise, there isnt anyone who can relate to me. it is really disturbing that the college crowd are still not informed on various forms of discrimination. it sickens me. and i stick by my comments. it is not a race card, and i was not alone when i was there. i give up on this coffee shop. and that is my opinion.  Users/KimberlyMiller


20090308 12:39:12 nbsp OMG!!! i just tried their smoothies due to the amazing weather we have! And let me say that the peach smoothie, with a hint of vanilla was the best tasting i have ever had. As usual, they greeted me super warmly, gave me a place to study, helped me set up my internet and made me an excellent smoothie. Other items i love there include their fresh orange juice, the chicken sandwich and the hot caramel machiato. Excellent stuff. Users/cndavid

20090319 12:10:51 nbsp I agree with nearly everyone here. Best thing to come to Davis in a while. Now my favorite coffee shop in Davis. Try the yogurt with a shot of espresso. OMG!!! Friendly service, clean storefront and bathroom, and excellent selection of drinks and food. Great location too and free wireless! What more can I say? Ill probably never go to Mishkas again. Users/condemned2bfree

20090430 19:55:00 nbsp This is the best coffee shop/cafe in town. Probably the friendliest people Ive met in a business after living in Davis for 24 years. Since they opened up near where I work Ive gone in almost everyday Im at work. It always clean, their sandwiches and wraps are delicious, they have fresh baked pastries every day, and they had memorized my favorite drink quickly and would be having it ready by the time I got to the counter. If someone says one more thing about race with these people Im going to throw up. I am not the same race as the owners of this shop but they treat me better than any store owner has, and they treat everyone else who comes into the cafe exactly the same. The best place in Davis to get your coffee and relax and experience true customer service. Users/JeremyDutch

20090514 18:37:53 nbsp I finally got a chance to try their coffee, a mocha, and I have to say its the best mocha Ive had in the 2+ years Ive lived here.  It was clean (most have a kind of muddy quality) with no crap on the bottom, and oh so tasty.  I love my mochas, have worked behind the counter in my time (52 years,) and this ranks up there with the best ever. Users/KatyMartin

20090619 16:08:01 nbsp I came here for the first time because everyone at my workplace was falling asleep, so the nearest coffee shop was Barista.  I grew up drinking coffee, so I love my coffee a little bit on the bitter side and not too sweet; I LOVE CARAMEL MACCHIATOS and this place makes the BEST CARAMEL MACCHIATO Ive ever had!  Their coffee has a bold, fragrant taste.  It takes a little bit longer to make (than starbucks for example), but the quality of their drinks is well worth the wait.  The owners of Barista were very welcoming and were very interesting to talk to while I waited for my drinks.  I will definitely come back here for the coffee and they also have live music at night (once a week? I have to check back with them) so I want to check that out sometime! LOVE THIS PLACE! Users/trambajuice

20090714 20:37:50 nbsp Great place to stop by for coffee or a quick lunch!  Their wraps are yummy and chai tea is also good! Users/davisgirl10

20090825 19:01:11 nbsp This place is the best coffee shop in town hands down.  Maybe not for the die hard coffee drinkers, but for everyone else its the best.  Besides the great drinks, the menu is really good considering this is a mom and pop coffee shop.  Ive tried almost everything from soups to sandwiches, smoothies to sweets.  Really good and reasonable prices.  Another plus is the sarcstic humor the owner has. Some may take it the wrong way, but if you are quick enough to catch his jokes then the wait is well worth it!
Im definitely a believer, a follower, a disciple! Users/Rntolent

20090923 14:15:19 nbsp I agree about the coffee, but I think the star of the show is the food. These arent just deli sandwiches and salads,  but they have subtle  ingredients and are surprising good. Every week theres a new special that wont be found on the regular menu,  a new creation by Ray who owns the shop with his wife Bobbie.  Theres also  frozen yogurt thats more reasonably priced than anywhere else downtown, and if you like hell pour a little espresso on it. Great baked goods, pies, smoothies, My favorite cafe in Davis. Users/jedalexander

20091026 11:02:06 nbsp I go there all the time for lunch. Maybe too much. Roy has great sense of humor and loves to create for his patrons. I have had some great sanwiches and some good sandwiches, but I have never left dissappointed. Great place! Users/AIRBORNE

20091208 10:32:25 nbsp Delicious coffee and cute cafe setting I love any cafe with a leather couch.  Seems like it would be a very decent place to study and I will be returning to do just that. Users/mmangrum

20091230 21:19:47 nbsp Still the Best Espresso I have ever had in Davis great service, great menu and a very welcoming cafe. Also did I mention they have piroshkis.... yummy Users/Glady

20100116 20:18:32 nbsp I like this place. I was there midafternoon and theres no one..compared to the chain store they dont seems to get much traffic? I hope they stay in business, their calzones and other homemade snacks/lunch items are delicious.  Users/LeeY

20100211 15:10:53 nbsp THIS PLACE ROCKS! Users/WW2PILOT

20100211 20:37:51 nbsp I go there daily..... The owner is there everyday. He has a different joke everyday I see him..... Thats a lot jokes... Great place, great food, great coffee..... Users/DURAMED

20100923 15:22:29 nbsp Best hot chocolate Ive ever had. Free Wifi and a great place to study. The owner is friendly, remembers his customers and treats them well. Why go to Starbucks when you could come here? Users/Nerissa

20101010 10:16:46 nbsp Couches and free wifi? This is my new favorite place to read downtown. Users/EmilyH

20101021 14:12:49 nbsp Just went there for the first time today.  Love the atmosphere!  The coffees pretty good, and is competitive with Petes. Also, they have gluten free cookies from Sunflour Baking Co. and the guy working there said they planned to have gf desserts (cupcakes etc) in the future.  Im going back asap. Users/BaileyMeeker

20101109 11:13:19 nbsp I recently started training here.  The owner Roy is very intelligent, friendly and practical.  I received a fulltime job offer at Aggie Liquor and chose to quit.  I explained that I needed the money and was going to take the job.  He was VERY understanding.  This is rare.  I have the utmost respect for these people and their establishment.  ALSO, they are obsessive with cleanliness and pay CLOSE attention to the quality and consistency of their coffee drinks.  They also know all of the regulars and have their drinks started upon entering.  Dont support this place just because it is a small, family owned business, the quality of service and product stands on its own.  Thank You, MIKE   Users/michaelstrattonquirk

20101123 21:03:27 nbsp I went here today because I have been craving Fresh OJ for days now. It was a tad expensive but worth it. Sooo yummy. Both owners were very polite and enthusiastic. Their daughters hung out on the couches and were just adorable. Its so nice to see a family running a small business and loving what they do. I will definitely come back. Users/lunelectronique

20110211 02:44:39 nbsp This cafe is my favorite! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and the drinks are always delicious and amazing. The owner and his wife are always really friendly and the owner has a good poker face. He likes to joke that he is out of certain things and cant make my favorite drinks. He and my bf team up and enjoy making fun of me. Ok... irrelevant.

Im not a coffeedrinker so here is a list of the drinks I like to get:
Hot Caramel
Dulce de Leche Hot Caramel (not yet on the menu, but sooo good!)
Peppermint white hot chocolate

My coffee addict bf likes to get:
Peppermint chai tea latte
White mocha
Mayan hot chocolate or Mayan Mocha
House Coffee

They also have good food and dessert: Pies, cakes, cookies, muffins, calzones, sandwiches, and more. We had a piece of chocolate cake tonight. So rich and so good good!

One of my favorite places in Davis! I would go here rather than Starbucks or Peets any day. ) Users/KRSanta88

20110228 16:50:24 nbsp A self proclaimed coffee snob I just found this place as I needed to meet a friend somewhere close to the coop.  I will be back! I had a salted caramel mocha and it was delicious and great presentation as well. The server was extremely friendly. Users/LokiAbbi

20110502 10:28:04 nbsp Barista is my favorite cafe! Its definitely the best in Davis. Rohit is awesome, and the entire experience is always very pleasant. I recommend the turkey, pesto, and avocado on a cheese bagel. So good! The mayan mochas are also amazing, you can get it as a hot chocolate or spinner as well. There is occasionally a small wait in the midmornings because it gets busy, but its always so worth it, and theres magazines and television to keep you occupied.  Users/KianaFreitas

20110606 20:21:31 nbsp Best (and most importantly strongest) coffee in Davis! You will not fall asleep in any class after having a latte or americano. Great study spot and amazing food.

I highly suggest the caramel macchiato or chai tea latte.

You cannot go wrong with any of the sandwiches or any of the specials. The tiramisu and the scones are too good for words.

The service is phenomenal, and the owner, Rohit, is quite a character. Users/badwolf

20110627 16:48:32 nbsp Great little hidden gem in Davis.  Its kind of on the corner of what I consider downtown Davis so its not often crowded.  Great place to study, at least in the evenings which is the only time Ive been there.  Theres always an outlet available for your laptop and of course they have wifi.  Bonus is they have a little food menu.  Never as crowded as Mishkas and getting a seat has yet to be a problem.  Unfortunately theyre only open until 9pm on weekdays and I think 5p or 6p on weekends.   Users/DatGuy

20110713 10:26:57 nbsp This place has great coffee and a delicious iced green tea chai (try it!!) The owners are really friendly. The food is good and a reasonable price. I wish I knew about it when I was a student because I would definitely study there.  Users/LenaSchiffer

20111018 13:10:00 nbsp I came here for the 4th time because everyone at my workplace was falling asleep, so the nearest coffee shop was Barista. I grew up drinking coffee, so I love my coffee a little bit on the bitter side and not too sweet; I LOVE CARAMEL MACCHIATOS and this place makes the BEST CARAMEL MACCHIATO Ive ever had!

The owners of Barista were very welcoming and were very interesting to talk to while I waited for my drinks. I will definitely come back here for the coffee LOVE THIS PLACE! Users/Glady

20120202 13:18:16 nbsp I love this place.  The owner is the nicest guy in the world and the coffee and atmosphere is amazing!!  Give this place your business it deserves it! Users/EricPaoli

20120713 13:13:51 nbsp The BEST coffee shop in Davis. Their selection of coffees and their breakfast and lunch menus are amazing. Seriously though, skip Starbucks and come her for practically the same price, better quality, and a bigger selection. I had the Mayan Iced Chai Latte and it was so good! Next time I cant wait to try their breakfast burrito :) Oh and they also have a rewards card  Buy 9 drinks and get one free!Users/KayKay

20120908 15:31:37 nbsp Went there on a saturday afternoon, had been once before. I really like the ambiance and the view of the street/wide windows, seems like itd be a nice place to study. I had a spinner drink which was also very good.  Users/Babhari

20121205 20:34:55 nbsp The best place to study and talk with friends in Davis. Great food, perfect coffee, free wifi, friendly owners and staff.  Users/BeverlyWilcox

20121211 21:27:41 nbsp Couldnt agree more with the comment above. Best coffee shop in Davis! Wish it was closer to my apartment so I could visit more often. Users/BrianPakpour

20130104 17:11:24 nbsp I was wandering downtown during break, just looking for a nice place to read and came across Barista Brew. I like the ambiance and the nice couches are ideal for relaxed reading. A lot of the menu looked really goodHazeulnut hot chocolate looked delicious. However, I just wanted to warm up with a slightly lowerincalorie drink and ordered the house coffee. I did not specify hot or cold but received it cold, despite everyone else in the shops drink being hot. Which ended up being fine, I figured she misheard my house coffee with iced coffee. However, I personally did not like the coffee at all. It tasted like cigarette smoke, which from what I understand, means that the beans were burned. This seems believable since the barista looked frazzled and new,  so perhaps shes unused to making it ? Anyway, I couldnt finish even half of my drink and threw it away when I left. Its got a great ambiance, but Id probably go there to read and drink something other than their coffee.  Users/HannahToru

20130405 09:43:10 nbsp This place has the best coffee in town!! Hands down!! My boyfriend and I went here to try it out last week and now we have come back almost everyday. He always gets their hot chocolate and says its the best he has ever had. I love their mochas, iced, frozen, or hot. I also had a tuscan wrap and it was very good. Users/Glady

20130410 15:58:29 nbsp Absolutely wonderful coffee. My only complaint is the severe lack of electrical outlets. Considering how many people use laptops here, Im surprised they only have one or two outlets. They seriously need to just provide a surge protector so people (like myself) arent frustrated out of going here due to drained laptop batteries. Users/MatthewPorter

20130509 16:58:23 nbsp I started coming here when I worked up the street as an alternative to getting fast food coffee (yuck). But Barista quickly became a regular destination even when I wasnt working! Drink of choice  soy latte spinner! Other coffee places have blended latte drinks and theyre just not the same. I crave these things! The regular coffee is a bit dark for my taste, but I know a lot of people like that. Their house coffee is my boyfriends favorite in town. Sometimes on the specials menu is a peanut butter chocolate mocha drink  a spinner, I think  that sounds weird but is SO GOOD. As for winter, try the chai tea latte or mayan hot chocolate. Warms you up from the inside out. :) P.S. Best scones in town. Im a big fan of Coop pastries, and Nugget has good cinnamon rolls, but for scones, its Barista. Users/gurglemeow

20130926 18:23:26 nbsp Wonderful, excellent, superb service. Roy makes you feel like a good old friend and he really enjoys talking with his patrons, giving them quality service. He is a hard working family man with an excellent barista bar.  Good iced, hot or special coffee and delicious snacks, pastries and hot foods like breakfast burritos and eggs. If you need a place to study, his couches and chairs are welcoming. I really recommend that if you want a nice cup of coffee in a lovely atmosphere, that you visit Roy :) Users/amandasinclaire

20140227 02:55:55 nbsp Has a good breakfast burrito and good coffee. But walked in an hour before closing time to find chairs stacked and mopping. I was shuffled out by one the employees Inhospitably. I was hoping to have coffee with a friend. I guess she couldnt wait to get out of there. I just wish they would close when they say they are going to. Users/dkfenton
