The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a relatively visible Owls owl of the Davis area. It is also the cutest and most charismatic owl that you will see around here.  If you are out at night, even Downtown downtown, dont be surprised if you see a silent white flash above you or hear a highpitched screech: its a Barn Owl.

You may also have noticed the abundance of large wooden boxes in the trees around Davis.  The city of Davis has been pretty active in trying to provide adequate artificial nesting cavities for this species.  In fact, thats probably why they are so ubiquitous around town.

In 2008, the city began placing new barn owl boxes and replacing old boxes which had fallen into disrepair after the retirement of Terry Schulz (former supervisor of the California Raptor Center) in 1991.  One of the goals of the program is to help control the citys growing rodent population by encouraging the presence of the owls whose natural prey are rats and mice.  Ideally, this would also lead to a reduction in the use of rodent poisons.Footnote(Golden, Cory. Heartfaced helpers: City hopes barn owls can curb rodent population. The Davis Enterprise. 20080720.)

The boxes were placed by the citys tree crew, who http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2012/06/08/daviscutscitytreetrimmerscitizensconcerned/ was recently dismissed by city manager Steve Pinkerton immediately following the passage of 2012 City Council Election/Measure D Measure D. The future of the program is unclear.


20071213 20:08:34 nbsp Late one night on my balcony, I thought I saw a seagull floating on the breeze toward me.  I wondered what a gull would be doing flying solo so late at night. When it neared the balcony it circled and looked down at me...it was a Barn Owl.  First time I had seen one and it was beautiful.  The breeze kicked up and it floated away over the building.
