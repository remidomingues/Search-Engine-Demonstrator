Barnabas Truman started life as a harmlesslooking little kittycat. My, how hes grown since then!




Okay, so he went through a rather awkward phase during the 1970s. Didnt we all? And dont you wish you hadnt seen this? Thats what I thought. Move along now.




In the summer of 1600, Truman was working as a bounty hunter and trying to hunt down his cousin, the notorious pirate captain Mad Morgan Burnsides. After a long and glorious battle, Truman was beginning to gain the upper hand, but a fateful accident (apparently involving an accordion, a scimitar, and three bottles of fine Jamaican rum; he doesnt like to talk about it much) caused him to lose his beard, his honor, and his left eye, and the brave Truman was forced to retreat. While recuperating from his injuries he learned to play Irish music on the hammer dulcimer (already being quite skilled on the pennywhistle and wiki:WikiPedia:Bodhran bodhrán).





As soon as his beard grew back in, Truman donned his green warcloak and picked up his mighty staff, and, invoking the powers of the mighty surfer god Saint Christopher, walked boldly across the waters of the ocean, once again seeking the dastardly pirate Burnsides. This time he won the battle, regained his honor, and took Burnsidess awesome pirate hat as spoils of his victory. Tragically, it was not until Truman triumphantly returned home that he realized to his horror that he had been wearing the eyepatch on the wrong side the whole time.




At some point in history, Barnabas found the time to earn a bachelors degree in mathematicks, with a minor in philosophy. This picture proves it! See? Also, he has horns. Sometimes. Theyre retractable.




He now lives under the Bike Tunnels bridge between Olson Hall Olson and Shields Library, as a friendly ogre. Any rumors that he eats a freshman each year are slanderous, and any resemblance to a certain halfgiant wizard school dropout is strictly coincidental (he had the beard way before http://www.sunpig.com/abi/images/2005/11/hagrid.jpg Robbie Coltraine made it popular!).



Truman works as a TA for the Mathematics math department and an observer/judicator for the Ancient Order of Walkers. He spends most of his spare time playing awexome Irish folk music, getting very close to ascending in NetHack, thinking about mathematicks, thinking about his lady fair, thinking about Renaissance Faires, arguing about philosophy/religion/politics/whatever strikes his fancy, watching silly Flash cartoons, reading silly web comics and sillier fantasy novels, and telling ridiculous stories like the one you have just read. He has also taken up, as a hobby, the study of the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion and its history and philosophy. He does not have a grappling hook, but he does have a really cool walkingstaff. (Sorry, ladies, Mr. Truman is no longer single.)

20060111 12:00:56 nbsp Hi, Im writing an article for the California Aggie on the Jagged Tree. You had some really nice things to say about it and I was wondering if I could interview you. If you are interested, my email is cemaris@ucdavis.edu. Carly Users/LizethCazares

20060209  2:41:00 nbsp There where four of us. Everything fell apart. I’m sorry. I found out I’m Manicdepressive.  It explains some things.  I still feel embarrassed. I want to come to terms with Matt’s death.  Could you tell me if there is a place dedicated to remembering him? Also, On one hand I’m trying to make more since of C4, MBS, and exponential distributions.  On the other, I’m looking for some one who knows how to play Go.  Could you help me with any of this?
    There is a group that plays Go at the E Street Cafe Roma early Thursday evenings.  There are also various student and public grief counseling services available that you might look into.  Most are very low pressure and just give you a place to talk and discuss your emotional state.   Users/JabberWokky
    Given that I am 452 miles from E Street, Google’s guess is that I would make it there around midnight.  So even though I would very much love to come today I will have to wait until next Thursday.  Also, I want to thank you for making this easier JabberWokky.  Users/PatrickStaight

20060527 21:22:10 nbsp You look a lot like my geometry TA from last quarter, who was a very demanding grader on the journals, but added a lot of insight through his frequent comments, increasing my learning experience.  i still cant figure out how you folded the corner of that page so it wasnt straight   :) Users/MattHh

20060714 13:27:46 nbsp Hey Barnabas! Im from the Pacifico coop, and Im working under the new management (nasco) to change things around here.  I read your comment on the Pacifico wiki page, and I was just wondering if you would be open to changing or removing the comment (and maybe also elaborating on your experience to me via emailI really want to hear about experiences and ideas to make it better).  I really appreciate the comment and definitely want people to have an honest perspective of the place, but I was hoping you might be on our side in trying to start fresh.  Were having a tough time getting people in here, a lot because theres a bad impression out there.  But I think theres a lot of potential.  My email is alice@pacifico.nasco.coop, I really hope to hear from you! Users/AliceWhite
