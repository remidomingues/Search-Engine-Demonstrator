Barnyard Theatre is a community Live Theatre theatre group dedicated to creating theatre from scratch. Each summer this group of theatre artists gathers in Davis, CA to develop a new script, and transform a working barn into a nontraditional theatre space. Situated in the Outskirts fields of Yolo County, the unique location of the Historic Schmeiser Barn supports Barnyard Theatre’s innovative staging and the creation of dynamic relationships between actors and audience members. The artists are dedicated to producing highquality theatre in a stressfree environment.

The Barnyard Theatre motto, Think Organic, reflects a dedication to theatre from scratch and a return to Yolo County’s agricultural roots in the Historic Schmeiser Barn.

Barnyard Theatres productions of original works include the premieres of the fulllength shows My Avisia Winger, The Sterling Affair, and A Flag Touched The Ground.

In 2006, Barnyard Theatre partnered with UC Davis Friends of Acoustic Music to present the first Barnyard Acoustic Music Festival in The Historic Schmeiser Barn. The Barnyard Acoustic Music Festival featured four separate evenings of acoustic music on the dark nights of the July/August theatre run, with a different theme highlighted each evening.
