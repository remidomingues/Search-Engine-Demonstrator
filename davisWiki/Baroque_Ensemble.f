The UC Davis Baroque Ensemble focuses largely on the music of the 17th and 18th centuries, with special attention to technique of the Baroque time period.  Players may make use of the UC Davis early instruments collection, playing on period instruments is not only ideal for a purer sound production, but also demands the players to employ the proper technique.
