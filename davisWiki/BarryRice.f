I for one didnt think you were bragging just pointing out that with hard work and good instruction you can go far... what is your book called, and how are you carnivorous plants doing? The fly traps and pitchers are my favorites  Users/StevenDaubert

The carnivorous plants are doing well! And the ones at the UCDavis Conservatory are doing well well, too. The new book is called Monster Plants, but it is only available through the book buying program at Scholastic.

Cheers!!!
