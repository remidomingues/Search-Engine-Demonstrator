Baseball has a long history in Davis, and informal games were played here as early as 1857.  The game was originally introduced into California as a result of the Gold Rush.  Back in those days, groups of farmers played on ranches while wearing overalls, without the benefit of specialized equipment like baseball gloves.  By the Davis Timeline/1880 1880s , baseball had surpassed horses horse racing in terms of popularity and became the dominant sport of the region.  The home team was the Davisville Oletas who played regularly in the Y of the Southern Pacific Depot.  The Oletas had a strong rivalry against the nearby Dixon Etnas.  It was very common for spectators to gambling gamble openly at games back then.

Davis was the hometown of Myril Hoag, a major league player who helped the New York Yankees win three World Series in the 1930s.
