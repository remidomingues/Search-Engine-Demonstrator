Looking for a place to shoot some hoops?

Regular pickup games:
  Sundays @ 8:00 a.m.

Public basketball courts:
  Central Park
   1 half court  isnt it lit?
  Dairy Basketball Courts near the south end of the Dairy IM Field on UC Davis campus.
  La Playa Park
  Manor Park or Slide Hill Park  pretty close to regulation height
  Oak Grove Park
  Pioneer Park
  West Manor Park
  Willowcreek Park  half court
  http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/stoneg8/ Stonegate Country Club  pseudopublic: must be a CC member (or rent from someone that is, or know someone that is and doesnt use their membership).  Hoops are generally way too low, which leads to people dunking, which exacerbates the situation.
  Mace Ranch Park

Lighted outdoor courts:
  Chestnut Park
  Hacienda Park
  Playfields Park  I think they stay lit until 12.  I may be wrong.
   At the western end of Research Park Dr.
   2 half courts.  in good shape.

Indoor courts:
  The ARC
      There are pickup games in the mornings, weekends and evenings. Many good players, not just undergrads, guys in their 40s and 50s as well. Fun to watch.
  Hickey Gym
   Neither of these are open to the general public.  In fact, evening and weekend rec. ball isnt scheduled at Hickey at all, as of April 19th.

Apartments with courts
  Allegre Apartments
   1 full court
  Arlington Farms Apartments
  The Lexington Apartments, on the southeast edge
  Silverstone Apartments
  Tanglewood Apartments
  Temescal Apartments
   1 full court.  crappy.  lots of rocks and dirt on the court.

Schools with outdoor courts
  Any Davis elementary school
   Their hoops are usually misaligned, but are really forgiving.
  Any Davis Jr. High.
   Emersons hoops are all 46 too low.  They resurfaced their courts a few years back and never raised the hoops to match.
   The new Jr. High has nets! Havent measured the hoop height yet.
