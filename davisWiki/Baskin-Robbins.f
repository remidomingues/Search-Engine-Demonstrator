 

BaskinRobbins is one of the Ice Cream ice cream shops in Davis. BaskinRobbins and Donuts Dunkin Donuts are owned by wiki:WikiPedia:Dunkin_Brands Dunkin Brands Inc..

Every Tuesday night, 6PM until closing, is Discounts and Freebies Dollar Scoop Night where you can buy an ice cream cone for $1.50. Kidsize scoops are a dollar.


They serve softserve. The soft serve is not yogurt but low fat ice cream in softer consistency.

The North Davis store (doesnt matter  it isnt open!!!) had been remodeled when it was still open. It was the first Northern California store and the ninth nationwide to complete the transformation. With it came a new look and new menu items. WiFi access was free with any ice cream purchase.

Store Closing
At the end of business hours on Saturday, September 12, 2009, the North Davis location closed their doors for good.
The downtown location remains operational. A Korean restaurant named DOSiRAK took over the North Davis space in September of 2010.

  Gotta love ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!



Apparently, Frozen Yogurt is no longer included in dollar night. I recently went to the downtown Baskin Robbins, and the girl that served me told me that only ice cream is offered for one dollar on Tuesdays dollar night. That was disappointing. That aside, the downtown Baskin Robbins has good service (although a few employees are noticeably stingy with the serving size they give you.) The North Davis Baskin Robbins isnt worth going to. It seems to have a smaller ice cream selection, a very annoying manager, and no softserve frozen yogurt. Users/SiennaGrass

I respectfully disagree with SiennaGrass. The North Davis Baskin Robbins has way better service. Its definitely more of a neighborhood store. The owner  I think hes the owner  knows most people on a first name basis. Downtown your just a number. North Davis has just as many flavors since the remodel. They have a bunch behind the counter and listed on a plainly lit sign. Plus they have a lot of new sundaes the Downtown store does not. Also, they just started showing Free Movies on a big screen outside twice a week (Fridays & Sunday) I think Star Wars is next Friday!  They have a sign on the door as to what theyre showing & when. Definitely worth checking out!!! Users/JAnthony

Yogurt IS still available in the small and medium size for 1 dollar on Tuesday nights! I work at the downtown Baskin Robbins and let me assure all the yogurt addicts that small and medium frozen yogurts are both $1 on Tuesday nights although for how much longer, I cannot say, as the franchise has been pressuring our shop to get rid of the frozen yogurt altogether due to poor nationwide sales Users/NickRhodes

I heard BR was doing a rebranding, and was starting in the Davis store... though no word which one. I didnt see anything on their web site. Anybody else hear anything? Users/JeffreyNonken
  Sometime around May 20th their Covell Boulevard location started looking pretty different.

The North Davis store is having our Grand ReOpening on June 3, having finished our remodel. We are the first store in Northern California and the ninth store nationwide to complete the new brand redesign. Along with the new look, we have new menu items that only transformed stores can offer. Along with the new store design, the North Davis store is showing movies for free three nights a week on a projection screen we set up outside the store. Friday nights are family movies, Sunday nights are film noir, and Wednesday nights are going to be anime. We also have free WiFi internet. We were even featured on Good Day Sacramento on May 21.

I havent been in the newly remodeled Covell BR yet...Im excited to see what it looks like.  Is the new movie night the reason why the bike racks were taken out of their old spot?  That was annoying.  The new bike parking spot on the other side of 49er is all squished in and is usually blocked off by people with their bike trailers sticking way out. Users/EmilyBlake
  Yes, the bike racks were moved to the other side of 49er Video to accomodate the movie nights. That was done with the approval of the landlords. Users/RyanClifford

The Covell store just launched its own website, br31davis.com. Its still partially under construction, but online cake orders are now available. Users/RyanClifford

20070402 19:33:50 nbsp North Davis BR is great. Sweet website Ryan. Users/IanBenton

20070513 15:21:46 nbsp I love the ice cream cakes. They can make some with really amazing designs. I just wish that there was an Ace Of Cakes Store in Davis. Users/Jedron

20070803 15:39:34 nbsp Love 1 dollar night me and mu girlfriend enjoy this great downtown location love i would say try it out break your diet go wild on Tuesday night  Users/Brians

20071016 16:58:29 nbsp I love their ice cream it is the best in town! My favorite is Chocolote Chip Coockie Dough! Users/pebble

20071028 23:09:29 nbsp I am generally disappointed with both BRs here when it comes to their quality of ice cream. However, you cant beat Dollar night....If you want to wait in a long line of 15 people or more. I prefer the North Davis one, but Cold Stone Ice Cream seems a lot better to me. Dont they make it there at the store at Cold Stone? Be prepared to pay more if you choose cold stone over BR Users/AnnaF

20080304 21:15:40 nbsp Okay, it seems that dollar scoop is now only for the kids scoop size, regular scoops are apparently $1.50, at least in the north davis location. Users/DavidPoole

20080611 22:23:18 nbsp I LOVE THEIR REESES SUNDAES! Users/davisrox

20080613 20:53:49 nbsp The icecream cakes are the best.  Its one of the best ice cream stores in Davis. Users/jrendler

20080627 12:16:09 nbsp The North Davis Baskin Robbins is almost always out of many crucial flavors of ice cream; once when i went they were even out of vanilla. This is the worst on dollar scoop night and i think they really need to consider restocking their items better. Also, almost every time I go there and order a blast, i get an employee who doesnt know how to make it and messes it up. Id stick with the downtown location, even though the lines are worse. Users/Davisgrad13

20080701 18:01:52 nbsp I just got back from a trip to the North Davis location, and it was terrible. Two of the people with me got 31 Degrees Below (milkshake type drinks) that were only filled up about 3/4 of the way. Two of us got chocolatedipped soft serve cones that were halfmelted and dripping all over the place, making a mess as we drove home. Also, the guy working there at the time (Beau) took forever to make our treats. Meanwhile the customers behind us were getting impatient, and one of them just left after a few minutes. Even though we used two buy1get1free coupons, I still feel gypped. Would not go back  Havent been to the downtown location, so I cant comment on it. Users/amlevitsky

20080703 16:48:54 nbsp Beau at the North Davis BR has no idea what he is doing.  My friend and I ordered chocolate dipped soft serve cones...pretty simple considering McDonalds has even perfected this cone.  The ice cream was half melted, the chocolate shell was thin, and there was chocolate dripping everywhere.  After commenting that they were messy, we were told But they are good.  So good that I pitched mine after having ice cream leak all over my clothes and car.  The service was incredibly slow and Beau spent most of our visit on the phone. As the people behind us said, we could have all made our own ice cream in the amount of time it took us to get ours.  Boo. Go downtown! Users/RMC

20080810 21:46:56 nbsp both baskin robbins are out of Daquiri ice right now! Users/StevenDaubert

20080910 09:07:13 nbsp I am an ice cream cake fanatic, and only mint chocolate chip and chocolate cake will do. In addition, the cake must have the good frosting. You know what I mean, NOT the nondairy fluffy frosting thats on the fancy cakes. It seems the downtown location never has this combo, but I can always rely on North Davis to have it. They usually have it in one of the $10, 24 serving cakes too... even better!  Users/AmLin

20081118 18:47:45 nbsp I have always liked the North davis stroe better until last Tuesday. I go there every week and get two scoops w/ a free waffle cone for $2. Last week I went in and got the usual and paid for it, then while I was waiting for my friend to get her ice cream the manager changed the price on waffle cones and made me come up to the register and pay extra for my waffle cone or else she was going to charge my friend for my waffle cone!! How is that good customer service? There were no signs stipulating the price change and I had already paid for my ice cream plus where does she get off trying to charge someone else for my ice cream just because they walking in the door w/ me. My friends and I are never going back there, they seem to change their prices a lot more than the downtown store, their $1 scoops are smaller, and their new manager is very rude!!! Users/Kortnie


20081129 22:26:58 nbsp Hi every one,
I work at North Davis Baskin Robbins, and I would like to address some of the issues that have been pointed out here.
The owner of the store has changed; since every leader has a different approach, the change of owner of Baskin Robbins on covell has brought with it many changes:
1) As  Kortnie has mentioned as of right now we are not doing the free waffle cone on Tuesday nights. On the plus side, however, we are not (and will never be) out of ice cream flavors. Also the change of the price of dollar scoop ($1 for kids scoop, $1.5 for single) is not a change made by this store, we have posted a poster that has been sent to us by Baskin Robbins that shows this price change.  We are just following the rules and what we are told.
2)We are trying our best to have at least one tub of most of the flavors that are offered by Baskin Robbins. If you do not see a flavor youd like, ask us about it. many times we have it in the back walk in freezer and would be more than happy to bring it for you.
3) Some of the workers are just getting used to the changes made since the change of leadership, therefore there might be some confusion. Please feel free to come to the store, or ask for the manager when you are not satisfied with your visit. We will be extremely glad to make your visit a satisfying visit and take care of you.

After all getting ice cream is supposed to be fun and a joyous occasion and we will do all that it takes to make your visit a happy one.

hope to have an opportunity to meet you guys personally,
Moozhan
Shift leader/assistant manager.

20081130 20:25:02 nbsp Moozhan I do not care if you have all the ice cream flavors (which the N. Davis store doesnt!!), that has nothing to do w/ my complaint. And how do I complain to the manager? The manager was the one that did it! She was very rude and unprofessional. I am still amazed at what she did. Also why is it that the downtown davis store still has free waffle cones and large $1 scoops if the price change was corporate?  Users/Kortnie

20081130 20:43:52 nbsp To Moozhan: Are you serious?  The North Davis location does not have as many flavors as the downtown location, and they are very often out of flavors. Several times I have requested my favorites and they were out of one or the other, and some flavors they never have.  Im a friend of Kortnies, and have been a customer of your location for some time, but will definitely be going to the downtown one from now on, as will my roommates and friends.  The downtown location does not charge for waffle cones with 2 scoops, and still offers the regular size for a dollar on Tues.  Even if they stop
doing so, I will still go there after witnessing the rude and illegal behavior of the manager at the north Davis location. Kortnie had already paid for her ice cream, other customers were being helped, and the manager decided to charge her friend for the waffle cone the employee has forgotten to charge her for.  That is illegal.  The transaction was over, and it was not her fault they forgot to charge her...also, I dont see how the manager can force someone to pay for another persons ice cream just because they walked in the door together.  I am not blaming the employees for making a mistake, that happens, but what the manager did is unacceptable. Users/kestrel

20081222 14:12:42 nbsp north baskin robbins will be open Christmas day from 116, and will have $1 scoop ice cream and cake sampling all day. :)  Users/Moozhan

20100224 00:35:41 nbsp Baskin Robbins is awesome! Especially the one downtown! The service is awesome. They def know me by name. They provide excellent service and they are very friendly. The cakes are just lovely as well! I would recommend going to this store! Also, they rotate their flavors so that they always have a new flavor!  Users/Dori

20100331 00:09:11 nbsp This place has impeccable service, I always leave a tip in their sorry little tip jar that rarely has very much money in it. And I like Rocky Road. Users/tneeley

20100626 19:01:52 nbsp Ive been to the E Street store many times and recently ordered an ice cream cake for the office. Samantha is
a true artist and made us a great cake. Doreen also does cakes and has a good sense of humor. The service
has always been excellent.  Users/nowhereman

20100929 21:42:02 nbsp BR may serve up delicious pints but doesnt recycle those pints boo! Users/RainbowVogt

20101203 19:43:50 nbsp I tried the red velvet cake ice cream yesterdaythe seasonal flavours are always the best! I love that they also serve soft serve now. Looking forward to 31 cent scoop night! Users/ArianeMetz

20110124 12:32:45 nbsp RainbowVogt: I spoke with the manager, Sam, at Baskin Robbins in Downtown Davis and she confirmed for me that they do recycle all plastic and cardboard materials. The handpacked small containers formerly known as pints are plastic and are recycled when they have been used by employees.(along with various other plastics sent to them by the corporation) However, she did admit that they have no control over what the customers do with their products once finished. Users/tneeley

20120820 21:50:53 nbsp Removed phone number of former North Davis store on Covell.  That number now belongs to my sons college apartment. Users/SteveChalmers

20130728 21:19:12 nbsp I just had some of the worst customer service Ive ever experienced at the downtown location. There was no one in line in front of us, and we still had to wait forever, probably because both of the workers were clearly blazed out of their minds. They kept disappearing into the back of the store, and when they decided to actually come up to the counter, they were listless and stared off into space. Except, of course, when one of their pals brought in their dog. One of the workers kept petting the dog (and Im not sure she washed her hands. It was a small blessing, I guess, that the other worker served us). The dog also jumped up and put its paws on the counter. Totally unsanitary. I looked for name badges to find out the names of these two awful workers, but, of course, they werent wearing them. The service has usually been fine (if mediocre) in the past, but after tonight, I wont be coming back. Unless, of course, I suddenly decide that I want my ice cream served by surly teens with drug issues. Users/YseldaMontez
