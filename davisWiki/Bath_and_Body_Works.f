20090405 14:53:23 nbsp I was wondering if this was a creative way of saying We do test on animals, but not on the very end product?: This Finished Product Not Tested On Animals... Users/EricaMacGregor
    Its pretty much the same thing as Not animal tested, but more honest in my opinion.  Im sure other people will counter, but the basic idea is: all these lotions, oils, soaps use a random array of chemicals and who knows what.  Somewhere, sometime, these chemicals were almost certainly tested on animals, before they were deemed safe to use in these sorts of things.  So B&BW buys a bunch of these chemicals up, uses them in their lotions/oils/soups, and then sells these.  I believe Ive read that this is pretty common even for a sizable majority of not animal tested products in the mainstream markets. Which is why I consider it more honest: while the finished product overall wasnt animal tested, many of the components/ingredients likely were sometime/somewhere by someone.  (In general, Im sure there are lots of more detailed info and exceptions or what not out there). Users/Edwins ES
