Of the different establishments here in Davis, such a simple item as a bathroom can make or break a given establishment. A place to go pinch one can make a difference of opinion of where, um, you do business at. All businesses have them, whether they let you use it is another matter. Some places even have Public Showers. If you cant take a bath in it, its a restroom, not a bathroom. Sometimes you might even see some conversations on bathroom walls or works by the gifted The Jock Artist Jock Artist. If that interests you, check out Urban Art.

If youre on campus, it probably means youll be running to the UCD Bathrooms.


 Considerations 
Access  The most beautiful restroom does you no good if you cant use it. Are they 24hour? (What are their hours?) Do you have to buy something to use it? Do you have to have a key? Do they open to the outside (like some gas stations) or to the inside?

Cleanliness  Does the floor have standing water on it? Do they have paper towels? Soap? Toilet paper? Is it ultracheap 1ply or better? Seat covers (the paper things, also called butt gaskets)?

Type  Single or multiple occupancy? Locking doors? Unisex or not? Urinals, commodes or both? Autoflushing? Shower? Bathtub?

 Restaurants

  Restrooms with nonfunctional locks
  Toilets which have heavy iron stains its possible to chip this off with a chisel and make it look like new again.

 Mens vs. Womens 
The biggest difference between the sexes isnt in their anatomy, its in their bathrooms. Here are some distinguishing traits.

 Mens restrooms 
  The floors are covered with an inch of yellow water with a few turds floating.
  Theres a rustedthrough or overflowing bucket in the center of the room for the men to piss in.
  If there are urinals, the bottom is full of cigarette butts soaking in urine.
  If theres a toilet, the inside is brown and the seat cover is detached. It may have liquid in it.
  There is no soap or paper towels, because everyone knows real men dont use such things.
  There are no flies, because even flies have their standards.
  They smell like a sewer.

 Womens restrooms 
  They have private stalls.
  The large makeup mirror has lights around the border.
  Ample supplies of tissues, soaps, cosmetics, etc.
  Clean bathtubs with assorted bubble bath soaps and bathing salts.
  A hot tub and sauna.
  A tanning booth.
  A waterfall to purify the air and sound.
  Ambient/newage music is piped in to mask any rude noises people may make.
  A private masseuse oncall for foot massages.
  They smell like a meadow of flowers after a spring shower.
  Have couches.
  Are always attended by a handsome, shirtless man with large pectoral muscles and a washboard abs.

 Unisex Bathrooms? 
If you are concerned about clean bathrooms, maybe youre interested in bathrooms that are accessible to differentlyabled persons and gendervariant people as well? All singleoccupant restrooms should be unisex. Some places even have multipleoccupancy unisex bathrooms/showers, but they are not common.

The UCD campus TransAction Committee is presently looking specifically for data on unisex bathrooms, both on and off campus. Anybody have this info? Please be in touch: mailto:mproebstel@ucdavis.edu mproebstel@ucdavis.edu  thanks.

  There are two singleoccupant unisex bathrooms on ground level of the art building in the hallway. They are labeled as such too, with proper signs.

 Toilet Snippets & History 
  One of the first public toilets was built by the Mughal King Jehangir in 1556, but even that was predated by Greek public toilets in Knossos, around 1700 BC. Even back then, public toilets were considered filthy, often vandalized and many preferred the open air to a public throne.
  Roman Emperor Vespasian had public pay urinals erected in the 1st century AD, as part of his public works program. The payment for use of these facilities was actually a urine tax. The emperor managed to increase his profit by collecting the urine and selling it to tanners, cloth dyers and launderers. Facing some derision for this urine tax, the emperor responded, Pecunia non olet, or Money doesnt stink.
  The water closet was invented by Brit John Harrington in 1596, while the valvestyle flush toilet was introduced in 1738 by J.F. Brondel.
  Public pay toilets were instituted by the French in 1872 when the government turned over maintenance of such facilities to private industry.
  King Louis XIII and Louis the XIV used to hold audience while using the toilet  Louis the XIII actually had a toilet within his throne.
  As of January 1, 1992, the state of California mandated ultra low flush toilets in all new construction.
  UC Merced installed waterless urinals when constructing many of its buildings; this particular style of urinal uses an oil cap to trap odors.

From a custodians point of view, the above regarding Mens versus Womens restrooms couldnt be further from the truth. They are almost equally disgusting with Womens restrooms only being slightly better in comparison. Oddly, Womens restrooms take longer to service. Theres more trash to clean out for one thing.
