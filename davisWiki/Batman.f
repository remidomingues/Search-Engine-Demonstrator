Batman can describe himself here. For example, are you Bruce Wayne or Dick Grayson? Or perhaps one of the failed backups? Maybe even Terry McGinnis?


20100314 23:11:30 nbsp Hello, and Welcome to the Wiki! Were a pretty friendly bunch around here, so feel free to ask questions. I noticed that you have been removing peoples comments from the Jiffy Lube page...Thats usually frowned upon. If you are associated with the business, I advise that you respond to the comments, rather than review them. As it is, all edits are shown on the Recent Changes page, and even things that have been deleted are stored in a pages edit history, so that finding out what used to be there is very easy to do. In any event, welcome! Users/JoePomidor
