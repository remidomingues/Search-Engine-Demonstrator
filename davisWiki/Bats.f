 

Although often mistaken for Crow Migration crows at Night Time night, the skies of Davis sometimes fill up with hordes of bats.  These handy and tr√®s gothique insect hunters help keep Davis bug free.  Next time you see wings flapping above you, look close.  There are several species of bats that live in Yolo County. The large colonies living in Davis are Mexican freetailed bats called wiki:WikiPedia:Mexican_freetailed_bat Tadarida brasiliensis. They fly out just a few minutes after sunset.

In downtown Davis, especially in the areas with large old trees, there are Hoary bats.  These are large (for California) bats which eat large nocturnal insects.  You may hear them clicking and chirping File(BatChirps.mp3) prior to flying, after it is truly dark.

 Local Species 


 Bat Colonies as Tourist Attractions 

In some other areas, bat colonies have become real spectacles for tourists.  While the colonies in Davis arent as large as some of these other cities (notably under http://www.batcon.org/home/index.asp?idPage122 Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, TX where 1.5 million bats live) they do provide an exciting event to a night.  Most of the colonies in Davis will clear out over approximately a 5 to 10 minute period each night.  In this time, hundreds or even thousands of bats can be seen.

 Protect or Exterminate Them? 

Attempts to rid the town of bats have been met with much opposition at City Council meetings. The camp protecting the bats was mocked by a Davis citizen who felt that the town was more protective of bats than of its own citizens. Unsympathetic to his cause, the City Council was not amused when he put on a Batman mask to curry favor with them.  There was also a successful move by some downtown businesses to remove a bat colony.  (on 3rd street?  anyone have more information?)

Incidentally, you have a http://www.batconservation.org/content/Batsandrabies.html higher chance of winning the state lottery than being bitten by a bat with rabies. The rabies danger from bats is actually http://www.animalhealthchannel.com/rabies/ much less than from other wild animals like raccoons and skunks.

 Bat Rescue and Rehabilitation 

If a bat is on the ground  do not touch it!  They are wild animals and should be left alone for many reasons.  Call http://www.NorCalBats.org/ NorCal Bats at 5309021918 or the California Department of Fish and Game for rescue.  NorCal Bats will send a volunteer to retrieve the bat, a free service that is safer for you and the bat.

If there has been skin contact with the bat, youll need to call your health provider.  If animal control retrieves the bat for you, they will have it tested for rabies.  This involves killing the animal since it is the brain that must be tested, so the act of petting that cute (and wild) animal condemns it to death.  Please do not touch them.


 Where to See Bats in and around Davis 



In May, the Yolo Basin Foundation (5307581018) begins tours to view bats in the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area.

Over a thousand bats were found to be living in Haring Barn during its demolition in 2002 on Campus and were http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/011102/DL_barn.html moved to a bridge in the arboretum where other Mexican freetailed bats were roosting.  In total, approximately 500 bats were added to the bridge colony, and another 500 were released.  Biologists at the time also discovered large roosts living under the Interstate 80 bridges by Putah Creek.


Theres a colony living beneath the Bike Overpasses pedestrian walkway over Covell, near Davis Senior High School.  As of June 14th, you can see them pouring out from under the bridge at sunset.  This is really a sight to see.  Bats also live under the Yolo Causeway, and can be seen flying out at dusk in great clouds.  Sometimes theyre also found near University Mall.  Woodland, as well, is especially populated with large bat colonies.

If you walk under bridges in Davis and hear squeaking noises coming from the bridge, you know its filled with bats.  The squeaking noises will reach a crescendo just before the exit for the night.  In Downtown Davis, the squeaks in the trees are Hoary bats.

There are bats that live behind the Hoa Viet sign, if you look on the ground under the sign you can see the droppings.

If you are lucky your cat will bring a fully live, uninjured, but stunned bat into your apartment through the catdoor and put it on you while you are sleeping.  And then you can get a nice closeup picture of a bat on your dirty kitchen floor before it finally finds it way back out into the wild.  Image(kitchenbat.jpg, Indoor bat!, 350, left, thumbnail)

You might want to bring a rain jacket. They get so excited they pee all over when they fly out.

 Bat Viewing Schedules 





At the times (eventually) listed in these schedules, you can plan to view the bats as they exit their daytime homes.  Be there promptly at the indicated time (or early) because the exoduses only last 5 to 10 minutes.  Mexican Freetailed Bats fly out at sunset, give or take 5 minutes.  It varies slightly with cloud cover.

If you add times to these schedules, please be precise down to the minute so others can show up at the right time.  Sunset times are chosen for the 15th of the month.

20050615 15:10:51 nbsp Back east we used to catch bats for fun as kids when bored.  Works a lot easier in the woods then in Davis, but take a handful of gravel or pebbles/rocks, and toss a couple high up against a tree.  You can trick a few bats into investigating.  Good timing and a blanket can catch a couple. Be careful not to hurt them, and watch out for the teeth should you attempt this.  Users/EdWins ES
 Bats are responsible for most human cases of rabies, at least in the US (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/bats_&_rabies/bats&.htm CDC ref.).  Read up on this before attempting to catch any bats. Users/DanWillenbring

20061023 11:15:39 nbsp When biking around Davis in the Fall, some tree or bush has white flowers, and smells strong, having an oily and musky odor around dusk (in my opinion, it smells unpleasant, and like something Id care not to mention here). Is this a plant pollinated by bats?  Users/MatthewTom

20120625 21:47:17 nbsp We saw them tonight (June 25) under the Covell Pedestrian Bridge.  We arrived around 8pm and they were already making tons of chirping noises in the grooves under the bridge, but we couldnt see them at all (though there are three lines of bat droppingsone for each grooverunning all the way across the road.  We got there way too early (didnt check the Wiki!), so it was a long an uneventful wait.  They started coming out in large groups exactly at 8:45pm.  This was 10 minutes after the official sunset time for today (8:35pm).  The bats would wait for a time when there was a break in automobile traffic, and then a bunch of them would come out.  As the next wave of traffic arrived, theyd stop coming out until the traffic passed.  We watched perhaps ten or twenty waves like this before we left.  Im not sure how long we were watchingat least ten minutesand they were still coming out when we left.  The flew pretty close to our heads, and pretty close to the cars that were passing by, but they never hit anything.  Definitely worth seeingIve never seen anything like it! Users/JasonRohrer

20130325 12:46:14 nbsp I saw somewhere between 100 and 150 huge bats fly out of the small tree just to the south of Chase in downtown at about 1:45 a.m. on March 23.  It was really cool but also scary/creepy at the same time because I had never seen anything like that before.  I dont even know how they all fit in there.  They were really really big and that tree was small. Users/BrianSlininger

20130906 13:41:51 nbsp Make sure your pets are uptodate on their rabies vaccines! One of my cats was a year outofdate when she caught a bat while she was sitting in a flower box on our secondfloor balcony (they swoop pretty close to the building).  The bat quickly escaped, but my cat was given a sixmonth indoor quarantine by the county because we werent sure if she was exposed to rabies.  She finished the quarantine, but I dont allow her on the balcony after sundown because I dont want her to hurt any more bats. Users/DukeMcAdow
