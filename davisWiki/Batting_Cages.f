The City of Davis operates these public Baseball and Softball batting cages. When the cages are open there is usually an attendant lending helmets and bats. Prices are $1 for 15 fast or slow pitches via tokens and the cages can also be rented for 15, 30, 45 minute, and 1 hour sessions by calling the Community Services Department at (530) 7575626.

The Batting Cages will close during bad weather, including very hot weather.  If you are unsure, please call ahead to confirm cages are open.

The Battting Cages accept cash ONLY (no checks or debit/credit cards).
