Over forty percent of the UC Davis students student population are Bay Area natives. Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose serve as anchor cities for the ninecounty region (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma).

Though the region is heavily populated, the Bay Area is renowned for maintaining much of its natural beauty. The bay, pacific coastline, and diverse geography create a spectacular urban setting. The fringes of the Bay Area can be reached in about an hour from Davis driving west on Interstate 80.
