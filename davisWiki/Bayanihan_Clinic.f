Bayanihan Clinic is a nonprofit organizations nonprofit medical services health care provider. The mission of Bayanihan Clinic is to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive primary care to the underserved population, particularly, the Filipino World War II Veterans and the the uninsured population in Sacramento and surrounding communities.  They provide preventative services, referrals to specialists, social services, and health education.

History
In February of 2002, a group of four UC Davis undergraduates, Julienne Angeles, Thea de Borja, Rosalyn Moya, and Voltaire Sinigayan, recognized the need of a free clinic catering to the Filipino community, specifically the Filipino World War II Veterans. Richard Ikeda, executive director of Health for All, became the group’s sponsor, and supported the development of this communityoriented primary care project. During the following months, a name was chosen, a mission statement was drafted, a major fundraiser was held, and a site was chosen for the clinic. In August of 2002, the clinic was designated a nonprofit organization by the Internal Revenue Service.

In October 2002, the group began its efforts to recruit undergraduate clinic volunteers, and specifically targeted Filipino prehealth students in hopes of encouraging students from this underrepresented group to pursue a career in medicine by giving them the rare opportunity of being able to learn and serve while fulfilling community needs. By 2007, Bayanihan Clinic officially joined other student run clinics affiliated with the University of California Medical Center.  The UCDMC affiliation has helped clinic in various ways such as having lab services provided by the hospital.

The Tagalog (one of many Filipino dialects) word, “Bayanihan”, was chosen as the clinic’s name to capture two essences of the clinic:
  Bayanihan, when translated from Tagalog into English means “a collective group of people working together towards a common goal”
  Bayani, which is the literal term for “heroes” recognizes the focus of the clinic’s target population, the Filipino WWII Veterans.

Primary Care Service
  Preventative Services: A patient generally comes to clinic with a particular health concern, and this concern (the patient’s chief complaint) is addressed at the clinic.  Includes immunizations, flu shots, cholesterol counts, etc.  Also includes physicals which serve to address any health issues discovered during the physical.
  Referrals: Because the clinic is able to only provide limited health care delivery, patients with more serious complications will be referred to specialists in the area.
  Social Services: During an examination, a student working in the clinic may learn of a social issue that may need to be addressed.
  Health Education:  The public health component of the clinic.  Includes a workshop on a particular health issue, posters placed throughout the clinic, brochures distributed to patients, and health information available in the waiting room.

Outreaches
Bayanihan Clinic serves the Veteranos at Magellan and Tower II monthly, providing vitals and patient education.
