20090212 13:04:54 nbsp Howdy! It finally looks like its been toned down enough that the advert flag can be taken off. The use of phrases like best in merchandise and prices and so on sounded like it was written by the owner. I put the other flag, for a photo request, back up, since its much preferred to have a picture of the actual store over a logo. For more info about how things are generally done around here, I would advise that you read the Welcome to the Wiki.  Users/JoePomidor
