Obviously, Davis location in the Central California Central Valley makes it a poor place to go looking for a beach. There is no ocean or water and therefore, there is no funFootNote(no ocean or waterrelated fun, that is.). The yearning to see the big blue drives many Davisites west on Interstate 80, past the Coastal Range and on to the beach. The following is a list of beaches that are conceivable dayAdventures adventures away.

 Sacramento/Yolo/Solano Counties

  Cache Creek 
  There are many small, sandy beaches along Cache Creek; there are several near the town of Rumsey that are clean, easily accessible and somewhat secluded.  The current can be swift and the sand in the creek bottom very loose, so use caution if you decide to wade out into the water.

  On the way to Rumsey along Highway 16 you will find Vernon Nichols County Park, which has a nice little swim hole and a couple of beaches.
  Folsom Lake 
  Lake Berryessa 
  Lake Berryessa has a lot of shoreline and coves not too far from roads and parking areas that are perfect for a quick dip or an afternoon of lounging.  The shoreline changes depending on the waterlevel of the lake.  (Keep an eye out for ticks if you walk through tall grass or bushes.)
  Meat Beach 
  Also known as the Rec Pool
  Putah Creek 
  Lake Solano County Park
  Sacramento River 

 North Bay 
  Point Reyes 
  Drakes Beach, Limantour Beach, and Point Reyes Beach.
  Check out Point Reyes Ranger Station a great place to get local hiking and backpacking hiking maps, see a mock wilderness, and even rent horses. They also have a authentic wigwam nearby. Most of the trails are bicycles bike and horse rider friendly, although there are exclusive hiker ones as well. Also check the station for updates on mountain lions and tule elk herd locations.

 San Francisco 

  Aquatic Park 
  Located next to Ghiradelli Square and Fishermans Warf, the Aquatic Park beach is one of the most popular bay swimming spots. The Dolphin and South End Rowing clubs are both located inside this harbor so there are many lap swimmers. Its a very urban beach, so there arent many sunbathers. Its pretty cool to swim laps around the tall ships though.

  Santa Cruz 
  Image(itsbeach.jpg, Its Beach in December (taken by Users/AmeliaCarlson aec), 200, thumbnail, right)
  http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/elnino/coastal/mainbeach.html Main Beach Abuts the http://www.beachboardwalk.com/ beach boardwalk; this is where most tourists come. The beach is often crowded in summer and has poor water quality due the nearby http://www.ci.santacruz.ca.us/pw/SLR/SLR_pages/SLR_Mainpage.html river mouth.

  Its Beach is immediately north of Santa Cruzs Lighthouse  this small http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/elnino/coastal/its.html beach is less crowded than others in town, borders on http://www.ci.santacruz.ca.us/pr/parksrec/parks/light.html Lighthouse Field State Park and is exceedingly Dogs dog friendly.

 Aptos
  Manresa Beach, Sunset Beach, and Seacliff Beach, among others, require parking fees. They are generally less crowded as you go south, away from Santa Cruz. On weekends and busy days, Sunset Beach runs out of parking. Seacliff Beach is out of parking more often than that.

  Oceanview Beach, Pajaro Dunes Beach, and others are free but lack much as far as restrooms go. Some have portable ones, but that changes with funding. They are less crowded than the paid ones.

 Between Aptos and Monterey
  From north to south, some beaches in this range are Zmudowski, Moss Landing, Salinas River, Monterey Dunes,  and Marina Beaches, None of these charge for parking, and they are much less crowded compared to Santa Cruz and Monterey, except that Marina doesnt have much parking. Local people and random tourists from really far away end up at Moss Landing. Also, you may want to Internships intern at wiki:wikipedia:Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute MBARI.

  Monterey 
  The beach wraps most of the way around Monterey, and usually all you have to do to find it is walk toward the ocean. Parking in Monterey is scarce on weekends and certain days, as well as metered in lots of places.

 Rio Vista 

  Sandy Beach 
  Im not sure if this can be truly considered a beach, but there is sand, water, and its really close by. Located on the Sacramento River, right before it turns into the delta, and then the bay.  Obviously there arent any waves, but it is a pretty good spot for windsurfing. A 40 mile drive, exit I80 in Dixon at 113, continue to 12 east.

20050306 10:02:55 nbsp Is it feasible to list the distances of these beaches to Davis?  This would give it a Daviscentric flavor and make it super easy for people to figure out where they have time to go. Users/CarlMcCabe

20050306 10:03:47 nbsp I forgot to say in the last comment, awesome page! Users/CarlMcCabe

20050306 10:15:48 nbsp Yes, driving times and directions should be added. Users/JackHaskel

20050402 12:54:24 nbsp Be kind of neat to see a wiki for Santga Cruz like here. Neat town as well. Users/BradCuppy

20050612 17:43:48 nbsp It says there is no water in the central valley. What about Lake Berryessa and the Sac River?  Users/GiladGurantz

20050612 20:33:46 nbsp What the wiki says must be true! Users/JackHaskel

20060315 12:44:16 nbsp In the summer one could go up to tahoe or in the foothills and find a lake. If you are looking for water fun, there is Lake Folsom(i think that is what it is called) and then there are many like an hr to 2 hrs away like don pedro, tullock, and new melones. Berryessa is good for a quick day trip as well.  Users/MarkMcDermott

20081227 22:56:23 nbsp I disagree with the travel times to SF and the Santa Cruz / Monterey Co. Beaches.  Users/BryceH

20110427 22:21:13 nbsp There are a whole bunch of beautiful small beaches if you take Highway 1 South from Half Moon Bay to Santa Cruz. Me and my girlfriend decided to take the long way to Santa Cruz last Spring and man, it was magical. If you want a whole beach to yourself, one of these places are your best bet. There was a pretty cool lighthouse along the way too.  Users/CecilioPadilla

20120728 15:00:27 nbsp Where is the closest ocean beach to Davis? Does not have to be for swimming, more interested in tide pools, and for taking pics of the area then actually going into the water.  Users/elizabeth2014
