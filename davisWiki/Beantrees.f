http://www.beantrees.com/ Beantrees is the coffee brand now served by the ASUCD Coffee House as of September 18th, 2006. Beantrees is 100% organic as well as fair trade and is located out of San Francisco. Previous brands sold by the ASUCD Coffee House were located in Seattle, which made for difficult business relations. Furthermore, this is the first time, all parts of the CoHo will be serving fair trade and 100% organic coffee.

The coffee prices at the CoHo increased this year, which is not related to the switch in brands. Increasing transportation costs as well the the increase in minimum wage in January 2008 were factors determining the increase. To save money buy a recycle reuseable mug, as the price for refilling those is still very low.

There is also a Beantrees wiki:Sacramento:Beantrees coffee shop in wiki:Sacramento.

You might also be thinking of a wiki:WikiPedia:The_Bean_Trees novel by Barbara Kingsolver that has very little to do with Davis.
