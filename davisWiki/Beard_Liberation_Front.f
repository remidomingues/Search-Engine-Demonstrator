The Beard Liberation Front is a shadowy Student Organizations cabal about whom little is known. There is a wiki:Wikipedia:Beard Liberation Front group with the same name in England, dedicated to the removal of a societal prejudice against the facially follically enhanced or Beards bearded.

You can see from the http://web.archive.org/web/20070227175805/http://geocities.com/fenikso/beard/ posters scanned by Users/BarnabasTruman that they are unaffiliated with the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion. Nope, no connection whatsoever.


Ok, how does a bearded fellow go about finding out where to get more info about this group? Id hate to think that such a good idea is just an ephemeral figment.

Presumably one finds out more about the Beard Liberation Front by not contacting the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, since the two groups are clearly not connected. Meanwhile, Ive managed to scan a few of the BLF posters and uploaded them here: http://geocities.com/fenikso/beard/ BarnabasTruman
