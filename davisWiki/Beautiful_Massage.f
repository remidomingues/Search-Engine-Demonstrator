and provides a bottle of water at the end of the massage.  Users/nowhereman

20110427 01:46:53 nbsp Was intrigued by the low price (40/hour massage) but very disappointed in the massage. She obviously was not formally trained and was a little unprofessional.  Users/JamieBeth

20110528 15:41:18 nbsp Li Li is really sweet. Very good price, and pretty good massage, though not the best Ive gotten. The place could be a little cleaner and more professional looking. Users/stevohfun

20120321 11:28:55 nbsp Youre getting a one hour massage for $40. $40 is cheap. If you expect to get a $180 worth spa massage then go to a spa. I found LiLis massage to be just what I needed at the end of a stressful quarter, and for a price like this is it hard for a student to turn it down.
Yes the place could be cleaner, yes the massage could be better, but hey now, youre getting a $40 massage from a very nice and polite lady.  Users/GuerreroVillarealLopez
