 Tanning Salons 
Tanning salons provide beds that emit UV rays affecting skin pigment. Some salons offer UVfree options that darken the skin without exposure to light. Tanning salons also provide an array of lotions, moisturizers and other skincare products. Davis doesnt support many tanning salons, possibly for http://www.melanoma.com/melanoma/index.jsp melanoma concerns, but those determined few have options.

A new law was passed that bans UV tanning by machines for anyone under age 18. Spray tans are still legal.

20081110 nbsp Is there a salon that does a good haircut for $30 to $40? Ive had haircuts in Davis on both ends of the spectrum ($15 and $60), but Id really like something in the middle. Im just a working mom with medium to long hair. Any ideas or suggestions? Users/NoelBruening

20100427 16:43:17 nbsp Ive been to several shops here in Davis to get my haircut (guy with shoulder length hair) and each time, the stylist/barber cuts it way too short.  Are there no good stylists/barbers in Davis? Users/Darkfallin

20120114 14:14:16 nbsp A female friend of mine has asked me to post the following:  I am looking for a place where I can just get a nice haircut each time without much fuss.  I dont want to color my hair.  I dont want to perm my hair.  Im also not going to be blowdrying or styling my hair.  I have very fine hair and I want to limit the stress that I put on it.  I realize that this limits the styles that are available to me, but I still want to get a good cut.  Sometimes what happens to me is that I get a few good cuts, but then the stylist seems to get bored because I am not buying expensive products or expensive treatments or doing anything fancy.  I end up with my hair too short or not cut carefully.  I just want to get a good haircut each time, and yes, I always tip nicely.  Any recommendations for me?   Users/CovertProfessor
  I think that Olive Drive Barber Shop is a great place for a nofrills professional cut. $16 for a cut that you wont need to wait 2 weeks for it to look right. She wont shampoo or perm, but you will look good.
   Thanks  somehow I missed this reply.  Ill pass along the suggestion.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120604 08:50:23 nbsp Does anyone know if any of these places will do a full Henna dye on long hair? Users/SharonRuth
