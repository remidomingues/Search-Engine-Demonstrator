 Beauty in the Book 


Beauty in the Book was a small editing business run by Danielle Moni√© and Elizabeth Hennies, two longtime Davis residents. They provided a wide range of services, from project development to copyediting. Their goal was to help writers communicate with elegance and clarity, whether writing fiction, nonfiction, or academic work.


Beauty in the Book offered:

Developmental editing, also known as project editing, takes a manuscript from rough to nearfinal draft. The editor works closely with the author to define the structure of a nonfiction work or develop the plot for a story. This is the stage in which editors assist the author with filling plot holes, fleshing out characters, and strengthening the narrative voice.

Substantive or structural editing helps an author to organize a piece in a way that makes sense to the reader. A nonfiction guide might be changed to provide clearer transitions in a more logical progression, while a novel might rebraid its plotlines to increase tension or provide clarity.

Stylistic editing clarifies meaning, eliminates jargon, polishes language, and provides other nonmechanical linebyline editing.

Copyediting addresses grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style. A copyeditor checks for consistency of mechanics and for internal consistency of facts.
