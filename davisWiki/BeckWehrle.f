20081003 21:06:26 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Beck, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for creating the Gender Group entry... I asked a couple of clarification questions on the entry (keep in mind that a wide spectrum of people from Davis use the Wiki, from townies to professors to elementary school kids to undergrads).  If you would like, feel free to just edit the entry to answer the questions in the writeup itself and then delete my comment.  Good luck with the group, and once again, welcome to the wiki!
