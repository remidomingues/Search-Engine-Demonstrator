Building Contractors




20120323 17:13:20 nbsp Mike and his company did a large construction project for us about ten years ago.  Since then, Ive told countless people about them.  This was a large jobwe were essentially adding a room and tying the roofline in with it. We also had an upstairs closet remodeled.  The project took weeks, because it was huge.  These guys got it done on time, and were absolutely amazing.  Mike helped us with the design (ok, he designed it!) and oversaw the project.  His brothers (there were at least three of them in and out over time) were at our house almost every day.  I know you dont look for this when choosing a contractor, but these guys were some of the most positive, NICEST people Ive ever met.  They would joke with one another, and I never ever heard a swear word the entire time!
The project was completed right on budget, exactly as planned.  Mikes design looked far better than I could have ever imagined.  Instead of looking like an add on, our house looks elegant.  Their workmanship was FANTASTIC.  I dont have a single negative thing to say about them.  You wont be disappointed! Users/toriac
