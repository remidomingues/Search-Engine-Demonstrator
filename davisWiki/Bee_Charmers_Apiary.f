The Bee Charmers Apiary is an apiaries apiary where beginner Bees beekeepers, have a safe place to keep Honeybees bees while sharing tools, smoke, veils, flowers, honey, and advice with other beginner beekeepers.  The Apiary was started in early 2011 by the Davis Bee Charmer.  He hopes others would start charming bees and realized many people just need a place to do it.  Many of the bees are rescued swarms and cutouts from buildings that otherwise would have been sprayed with pesticides.

Charming vs. Keeping bees:

If we want to save the bees from total collapse, we need to change how we relate with them.  To charm is a lot closer to Respect than To Keep. The bees have certain needs.  If we provide for their needs, they will be a lot healthier and more resilient.
