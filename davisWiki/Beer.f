The Dollar Tree, being the mad note, sells Beer Steins for (oh my god!) a dollar. Fortunately they are quite sturdy and are fun to use. Unfortunately my friends and I have bought pretty much all of them out. Users/JohnDudek

     Monticello Seasonal Cuisine has an excellent beer list created after hours of laborious beer tasting by the owners & their beer geek staff.  The list features local breweries with sustainable practices.  Three beers are currently on draft: Eel River Amber Ale, Mammoth 395 IPA & Lagunitas Czech Style Pilsner.  By the bottle selections include Red Seal Pale Ale, PranQster, Bridgeport IPA, Kingpin Double Red Ale, Anderson Valley Oatmeal Stout, Rogue Brown Ale, Brother Thelonious, Lost & Found Abbey Ale & some Aspall Organice Suffolk Cyder.

     Nugget  good selection of craft brews, particularly at the El Macero location.
     Sudwerk  Brewery, drink in or carry out a case. If you want excellent Germanstyle lagers, this is the place to go.  They include Aggie Lager, the UCD endorsedFootnote(Probably not.) way to get snockered.
     Valley Wine Company  Great selection of lesser known brews, easy to miss because it doesnt stand out.
     Woodstocks Pizza  Smaller draft list than the Graduate, but with two rotating taps that are always decent to great.
  Whole Foods Market  Similar selection to Nugget.

 Further Afield 

     Ledgers Liquors  Liquor store In Berkeley, very extensive selection, lots of hardtofind gems.
