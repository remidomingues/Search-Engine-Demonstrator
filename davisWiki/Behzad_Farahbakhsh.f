 More information 
Behzad Farahbakhsh began his involvement in ASUCD in Winter 2003 as a ASUCD Senate Senate candidate. He was a part of the Student Focus Slate slate. In that election, Student Focus did very well and won 5 out of 6 available seats. He was the only candidate from his Slate slate to not win a seat, but was also a freshman at the time. Additionally, this was the last election before Choice Voting was adopted. His opponents at the time included Paul Amnuaypayoat and LEAD. Shortly after his Slate slates near sweep, he was offered the position of chief of staff and served under ASUCD President President Sara Henry for that term.

In the Winter 2005 elections, he is ran again for a seat on the ASUCD Senate Senate, this time as an independent. Some could argue that was a wise move on his part because of the freedom being an independent allows in decision making. Except he lost again.

I say vote for Behzad just for the sheer cleverness of his closing sentence alone.  Users/RajShah
   he wants to be a jack of all trades but master of none?
     Hes prolly going for the older Student Focus voters who remember his service to their Slate slate, along with the Independent vote, to gain the best of both worlds. It may very well work for an exmember like him this time, especially since many are giving the newer Student Focus Slate slate members the DCR Endorsement shaft...  Paul Amnuaypayoat
     I think he sounds like a true Student Focus loyalist based on his cheerleaderesque personal statement.  Go Behzad!  Because he didnt win the first time.  Nonetheless, I respect Behzad for running Independent, and not with Student Focus.  That deserves a cheer.  Users/RobertBaron
