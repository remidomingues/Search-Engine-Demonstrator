20120326 19:47:26 nbsp We are forever grateful to Dr. Lynn Hendrix.  She responded almost immediately to our call and came to our home to diagnose our dog near the end of his long and happy life.  He trusted her and was very comfortable.  She gently but realistically discussed his issues and made some recommendations.  We were not ready to humanely euthanize him that day but chose to spend a bit of quality time saying goodbye to our beloved pet of many years.  When the time was right, she came to our home and so gently and calmly fostered his trust again.  He laid on his bed and she gave him a shot that allowed him to slowly relax.  We petted him and spoke to him.  When we were ready, we gave the signal for the final injection that stopped his heart.  Dr. Hendrix seems to know the heart and soul of the pet and how they intersect with the heart and soul of the owners.  Her house call saved our pet from a frightening and painful trip to the veterinarians office.  We were allowed to comfort him in the comfort of his own home.  We never had to see him panting and fearful.  She also took him away for us so we could focus on sending his soul off to wherever it is that dogs souls go.  We felt Dr. Hendrix knew exactly what to do and when.  She is a gentle and understanding person.  Her diagnosis was correct and left us with no questions in our mind.  Making the decision to end a life is a gutwrenching, grueling one, but so is watching your beloved pet suffer when he does not have to.  We recommend Dr. Hendrix without reservation to anyone needing endoflife care or humane euthanasia for their pet.  She is sensitive to all issues surrounding pets, their families, and this very tender time. Users/MrsC
