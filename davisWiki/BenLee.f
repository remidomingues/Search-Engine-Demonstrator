20100526 06:20:14 nbsp Hey, Ben.  You have some kind of software installed that automatically adds Skype formatting when you edit a wiki entry.  Is it the standard Skype tool, or do you have some kind of plugin or toolbar installed that does it?  Were trying to figure it out so Bug Reports/Skype a complaint can be registered.  No worries, and your correction of the misspelling on the Hometown Chinese Food entry is appreciated... you just happen to have installed whatever it is thats causing the problem, so you might be able to help the wiki volunteers trying to track it down.  Thanks!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
