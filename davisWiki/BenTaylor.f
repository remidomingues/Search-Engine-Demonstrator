BenTaylor, what a guy.  Ben is an art studio major whos hometown is somewhere in Santa land (SoCal).  His interests include, but are not limited to graffitti, extreme biking in Davis (he lives in the fast lane), jumping in swimming pools late at night, and sleeping in art buildings.  He lived at 720 Anderson in the 05 to 06 schoolyear.  In the summer of 06 he escaped Davis forever.  Besides that hes cool.


Ive seen Ben more than any other person in the art building. He lives it, breathes it, and sleeps in it. Hell blow us all away one day with his work. Users/GracielaGuardado
