A note from Ben & Jerrys Davis:

Dear Valued Davis Customers,
We at Ben & Jerrys thank you for your many years of patronage.  This location is now closed.  If you have discount coupons (not free cone certificates), they will be accepted at our San Francisco stores.

On their last day of operation, 29 February 2012, they offered small scoops for $2 and large scoops for $3.  They also sold pints of Red Velvet Cake ice cream, 3 for $9.  They closed earlier than usual, at 5 PM.



Is there anything better for dealing with the hot summer weather in Davis than a delicious Ben & Jerrys ice cream or frozen yogurt sundae in a freshly baked waffle cone?  No, there isnt!!  Which is why some of us are very disturbed to hear that http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/wholefoodsconfirmsleaseatdaviscommons/ B&J will be leaving. Tragically,  the stores last day in Davis will be February 29, 2012.

And even if it aint a hot summer day it is a proven fact that ice cream in the cold makes you feel more comfortable to the temperature. Just like drinking something hot in the summer makes you feel better. Although Ben & Jerrys also offers hot chocolate, apple cider, and coffee in the winter. And if its raining the scooper may be willing to give you some free hot fudge.

Ben & Jerrys also offers ice cream Ben & Jerrys: Cakes cakes and they require 24 hours advance notice.

They have Fair Trade Certified^TM^ Vanilla, Coffee, and Chocolate Ice Creams, and several other flavors with a social conscience. This scoop Shop was opened in 1997 and was originally owned by Max Gitnick and Michael Gale of Ben & Jerrys of California, based out of Manhattan Beach. It was sold in 2005 to Sam Hensley of Concord based Uptown 33, and since 2009 the Davis franchise location is owned by Roger Kaufman of the  NYSF Partners, based out of San Francisco. In the year 2000, Ben & Jerrys became a subsidiary of  wiki:WikiPedia:Unilever but their original social mission has continued to be part of the companys practices.

 Events 


  Every third wednesday of the month Ben & Jerrys gives 40 percent of its total sales to a charity.
  They hold an annual Free Cone Day, as well as Ben & Jerrys: Vermonster Challenge Vermonster Challenge. The first team of four to finish a Vermonster wins free ice cream for a year!

The best ice cream in town, but unfortunately pricey.  Much more impressive than taking your date to Baskin Robbins, though.  Going to Baskin Robbins I can get cheap, uninteresting ice cream.  At least at Ben & Jerrys I get something that tastes absolutely delicious. Users/PhilipNeustrom

Good stuff, especially considering how warm it gets in Davis during the summer  Plutos followed by B&J is good stuff.  Users/EvanEdwards

I often have pregnant urges to eat Ben and Jerrys ice cream. SOOOO GROOOOD! (great + good!) Users/KatieWillheim is the coolest ice cream scooper in aaaaall of DAVIS. YAAAAAY. Users/DorotheaChow

And if you really want to see some crazy then check out the Ben & Jerrys Vermonster.

20070413 13:32:28 nbsp Very pricey, but for a really nice summer treat, get one of their lemonade/sorbet mixes. Its about half the size, twice the calories (and about the same price) as a regular Jamba juice, but sooo good. Users/AbbYu

20070919 15:30:55 nbsp Since Rob Roy often rehearses his band in my garage, I think I should get free ice cream. Users/JamesJobe

20070925 21:04:25 nbsp So rich....oh well.. when I need my fix, I go buy a pint at Nugget. Users/atwong

20100331 00:14:32 nbsp This place has great ice cream, but it is too expensive. Also their cakes are not as well made as BaskinRobbins. The cake decorator at BR, Sam, can do anything with a cake, she is much more creative. However, I do like the workers uniforms and the relaxed atmosphere of Ben and Jerrys and the fact that they are more friendly to the environment. Users/tneeley

20110514 21:18:23 nbsp Brittney and her crew did a FABULOUS job on my birthday cake.  They put a dragon on it!  If you want an ice cream cake, they can probably do whatever you need. Users/RianAMcMurtry

20110514 21:44:43 nbsp Its really great ice cream and the employees are very nice. But not worth the price.  Users/Dozer

20111103 18:07:53 nbsp Ben there.  Bye, bye! Users/BruceHansen

20111103 23:02:18 nbsp Such sad news about Whole Foods. Regardless of how this effects my old workplace, Whole Foods is better situated further from downtown (and further from the locally owned Coop).  Users/RobRoy
  Im curious  whats the connection between Whole Foods coming in and Ben and Jerrys leaving?  (if youre at liberty to say).   Users/CovertProfessor

20111122 21:46:40 nbsp the girl who was working tonight was awesome! super friendly. give that girl a raise! Users/RebelYell

20120201 16:51:50 nbsp Ive been a patron here since I was in undergrad...for a total of 6 years now I think. My recent visits since last year have been very disappointing. The portion you get for a small sized ice cream is now half of whats offered before, essentially doubling the price. The last time I went to get a milkshake I got only 80% of my cup filled, and the server told me that it has always been this way and its company policy. Ive bought ice cream here longer than that server has worked there, so I know that wasnt the case. I used to visit a lot more often, too bad. Users/winddolphin

20120305 10:10:05 nbsp I love this place and I am sad to see it go. :( Users/LauraSaldana

20120321 08:28:36 nbsp Whoa what happened?  This was a primo spot downtown.  Is this a froyo victim? Users/OliviaY

image(arrowinsightful.png, right, noborder, thumbnail, 400)20120514 08:25:07 nbsp I havent worked here for three years but I will say that the saturation of Davis market with the subpar froyo shops all around downtown certainly contributed to the downfall of this shop. However, since Im currently not running for anything and not worried about them as landlords, Ill say that Fulcrum Properties sucks. I managed the Ben & Jerrys in Roseville, CA (20002001) and in Davis, CA (20022009). Both locations were in a complex owned by Fulcrum Properties and I am not a fan of their style. It is sad for me, of the five stores I managed, the only store still standing is in Berkeley, CA. Yes, Ben & Jerrys is a premium quality and therefore not cheap but if you want the best car in the world it will cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars. You could have a couple scoops of the best ice cream in the world in a freshly baked waffle cone for about $5 and that it that not too high of a price for quality compared to the competition. Anyways, the slow death of Borders was also an affect on Davis Ben & Jerrys... as well as Target siphoning shoppers East. I worry for Davis downtown but, as Colbert would say, the market has spoken.  Users/RobRoy

20120515 11:37:46 nbsp Not a big fan of sweets, but I truly miss getting a scoop (or 2) of the sweet cream and cookies every summer.  Also, the people who usually worked there were always engaging and not hating every minute of working.  At least it appeared that way to the point of always making it a positive experience for my family.   Users/Aaron.Curtin
