20070614 21:14:20 nbsp Nice additions to the Urban Legends entry! Users/JabberWokky

20070819 18:35:39 nbsp While it probably would be a good idea to rewrite the Gunrock entry, stealing material that somebody else wrote isnt legal (and is kind of lazy).  Right under the edit screen it asks you not to do that.  I agree that the Gunrock entry is more pseudowit and less informative than it should be... so if you know a bit about the topic itself, please add it (in your own words). Users/JabberWokky

20070819 21:41:04 nbsp Sorry about this... actually, I did not make those changes to the gunrock page. I log into daviswiki using several different computers & I never log out. Looking at the IP address of that edit, I conclude that somebody has edited the gunrock content from a computer at work, where Im still logged in. I totally agree with the wrongness of stealing material from others.. thanks for the heads up! Users/BenjaminCatabas

20070820 03:16:23 nbsp No worries.  It was pretty clearly intended well, and swiping material from a public university site is likely the lowest level of theft.  Keeping everything free to use and open on the wiki is one of those things to keeping the wiki useful for everyone.  If your account was going to be used, at least it was used with good intent.
