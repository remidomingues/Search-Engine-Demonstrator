Whats your goal here?  Warning people?  Okay, thats one thing.  Making a joke?  Its not great... and expect a joke in return.  Also, the great state of California has determined that (as of January 1st) impersonating somebody online gets you a $1000 fine and up to a year in jail.  You probably should be aware of that.  I dont much care, but they might. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
