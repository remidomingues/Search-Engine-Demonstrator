20130327 21:34:58 nbsp I agree with TG  accidents happen, and no harm done.  Ive just seen enough of such deletions to know that not all of them are accidents... glad to hear that you appreciate the wiki, and I look forward to your future edits, on the Stone Soup Catering & To Go page and elsewhere.
