Name: Benjamin Rosenstein


Personality: Life long Townies Townie who graduated from UCD with a degree in Political Science in March of 2008.  It seems very likely that he will finally leave Davis after 22.5 years in August.

I am going to hopefully write up a review of every restaurant (I really have eaten at most of them), before I leave town.  I like the 4 star system, even though with the half stars its more like the 8 star system.  Oh, and I do think cost is big factor in my food reviews (ie I expect a lot less for $5 than $20, so thats why a fancy restaurant might get less stars than a cheap one).



American

Applebees  1.5 Stars

Its bland greesy food.  I wonder if I was put into a Applebees if I could point out anything differnant than a TGIFs or Shaniganz.  The only thing here I have every really liked are the acholic milkshakes.  These things can be really good, I like the modified mudsilde in particular.
