20100502 17:14:34 nbsp I had a bottom retainer that fell out and needed to be replaced. Dr. Runquist and his staff were prompt, helpful, and very easygoing. There were no new patient fees or any of that rigmarole as other orthodontists would have charged for. Very happy with the service and the prices! Would go back if I ever need any more specialized work. Users/wilkml

20120920 14:51:47 nbsp Broke a bracket a few days after I moved in, and Im glad that I picked Dr. Runquists practice to get it fixed at. I called in and got an appointment the next day, and when I went, it was great, he was professional and much more gentle on my teeth than my regular orthodontist. He and his staff were also really friendly and put me at ease. Users/VLieu
