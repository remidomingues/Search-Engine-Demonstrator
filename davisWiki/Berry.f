People often make the mistake of assuming that my owner is called ChingChing, but the truth is...it is the other way around.  Though seldom knownI am ChingChings boss. I make the call when to go out, where to go, and when and what to eat! So, dont mix it up again, you people!!

I am friendly but you cant be too forward/eager with me. Take your time and let me smell you and then we will be friends. I hate kids who run around me and scream. So dont do that because that frightens me. I like to bark because I am small (to scare the big guys), but I am not aggressive. The barks are just shows.  There are often times when I want to be left aloneso dont keep calling me because I need some quiet moments to think about complicated issues, like animal rights and social security.

I weigh 2 kilos but agony aunt says size doesnt matter.  I am 13 so I really look after my health.  Like Jack, I am on an organic homecooking diet (gd decision, Jacks mum!).  My epilepsy and asthma have completely disappeared since I boycotted commercial dog food. I made that decision after I read about what awful ingredients BAD BAD heartless people put into commerical dog food.  It is worse than what school children eat in Britain.  (I was like, How can that be??  Its WRONG!  I deserve better!!)  Remember, we are what we eat!
