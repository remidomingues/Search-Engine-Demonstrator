Berryessa Brewing Company is a fantastic, fairly local Breweries brewery.  It is about a 30minute drive from Davis. Their beers first started popping up in the area in 2012, and can now frequently be found on tap at a variety of local establishments, including The Davis Beer Shoppe, Village Pizza & Grill, University of Beer, and The Graduate.  Their flagship beer is The House IPA, which is a big, rich, floral IPA.  Their taproom also features a rotating selection of their beers, including at various times a baltic porter, a golden amber, a darker amber, a saison, a couple of different pilses, a double IPA, and a surprisingly balanced triple IPA.

In addition to bars that serve honest pints honest pints and samplers of six 4ounce pours of whatevers on tap, you can purchase 64oz. growlers of whatevers on tap.  They have a pressure growler filler right at the bar.  A new growler is $20; refills are $10. CA state law requires that you they can only fill growlers they sold you. They also sell kegs of their beers in various sizes.

Currently, they do not distribute their beers in bottled form.

They do not serve food, but they do have a grill outside the taproom that patrons are welcome to use.  Sometimes, an employee or another patron will grill up some sausages which you can buy at cost.  You are also welcome to bring in outside food.  Its a good opportunity to pick up some takeout tapas at Ficelle in downtown Winters.

The taproom is a great place to stop off on your way back from a weekend trip to Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve or Lake Berryessa.
