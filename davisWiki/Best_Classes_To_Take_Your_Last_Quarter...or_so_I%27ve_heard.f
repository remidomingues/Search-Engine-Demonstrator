Best Classes To Take Your Last Quarter...or so Ive heard

  Plant Biology 1 (PLB 001): Professor Marrush is such a nice old man; duties and expectations are unclear at times, but its all good; you get to plant tons of different vegetables and herbs in your individual 75foot row
     I took this when I needed a couple of units, and it was a fun class.  You do have to write a large paper (well, you did when I took the class  I assume it hasnt changed).  Growing your own crops is fun.  If you take it in spring quarter, you can harvest other peoples abandoned crops once the class is over and everyone has left for summer. Users/AlexPomeranz

 English 5F: Read and write short stories in a small classroom. Lots of fun.

  ECS 15  Intro to Computer:  Take it with Professor Puketza.  Easiest class Ive ever taken in my college life.  4 units, its two diff ges one of which is writing > Longest paper was 4 pages long, and graded on trying.  I got a 99.6% in the class without ever going to the lab (did it at home in 20 mins instead).  He kept offering extra credits to everyone, and if you got a score below 85 on any lab , you could redo it > as long as you turn in a redo you get 80 points minimum.  Its practically impossible to fail.  For 4 units, writing ge, and compsci ge, well worth it for the A+ on transcript.  Also, Im told you get extra print pages for being enrolled, score!

  Humanities 1 Forum (HUM 1): Great for an easy two units; topics vary

  Tractor Driving (ABT 49): Learn what the implements are, and how to drive gas and diesel tractors.  Youll feel speedy at four miles per hour.
     Basically the best thing you can ever be a part of at Davis. Users/EricPrice
     Ive heard this class gets you dirty and oily, but I personally havent taken it.  Users/AlexPomeranz

  Ultimate Frisbee
     Any PE class is good for 0.5 units.  Users/AlexPomeranz

  Intro to Beer and Brewing (FST 3): Learn about the production of beer, the difference between lager and ale, the differences between various beer styles, and the health impacts of drinking beer.

  Organic Crop Production Practices (AMR 49)  Learn about Sustainability sustainable agriculture and work in the Student Farm Market Garden.

  The Mushroom Class (PLP 40): Learn about the life cycle of Kingdom Fungus, as well as the colonization habits, phenotypic characteristics, and culinary uses for half a dozen gourmet mushroom varieties.  Grow regular white buttons, shiitake, maitake, enoki, oyster, and reishi mushrooms.  You will keep a journal of each crops progress and turn it in for credit.

  University Chorus (MUS 144) if you need upperdivision units and can sing decently.

  Economics 1A or 1B  Online homework that is due at the end of each week.  However, those assignments are very easy and take only 20 minutes or so.  Other than that work, it is an easy B/B+ for sleeping, A/A for trying harder. Your advisors at freshman advising were lying out their teeth when they said either of these classes were difficult. Prof. Hoynes is excellent for 1A.

  Exercise Bio 116 (Nutrition for Active People)  Take with Dr. Meredith, she is so awesome and really wants everyone to do well. Great class if youre interested in the topic; she makes it very fun and worthwhile to come to class. All lectures are in a reader. Take it P/NP just to ease the pressure; but if you make some effort, youll get a B.

  DES 1  Design and Visual Culture w/ Dr. Wagner.

  GEL 36  Solar System w/ Professor Osleger.  Great teacher, interesting class, easy to get a B and with a little extra work an A. Usually only taught in the spring.

  Human Development 12  Human Sexuality class.  A 3 unit class that wasnt all that difficult, but did have a long paper to write.

  ARE 112  Business Organization with Butler.  Teaches you how to manage people, lecture is independent from the book but both are extraordinarily interesting.  Butler is one of the best teachers I have had yet.

  HIS 111B or C  Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome with Professor Spyridakis.  If you are a history major, I believe these are required courses and so you should probably take them prior to your last quarter at UCD, but I recommend these courses to anyone regardless of major.  I wasnt a history major and I found them to be so enriching.  And Prof. Spyridakis is brilliant and very entertaining.  Trust me when I say that it is a very lively class.  Register early as I believe there huge waitlists for his classes.  At least, this was the case when I took them.  ~CurlyGirl26

  ESP 198/298  Education for Sustainable Living Program Education for Sustainable Living Program. 1. Its led by students, one of the only such courses on campus. 2. The speakers are all really inspiring and awesome people, and actually make you excited about things to do once you leave college. I actually realized that there is hope for those of us who dont want to just work in a cubicle. 3. Its only 2 hours per week, and there are no tests! will
