University departments will put up prospective faculty here when they are trying to woo them.  The location is right in the middle of town, so convenient to just about everything, and you can practically fall out of your room into Cafe Bernardo Caf√© Bernardo, restaurantside or counterside.

20091212 05:43:48 nbsp WARNING: INHOUSE THEFT! My family was subject to a room break in, with subsequent auto theft in the supposedly secure garage. The security cameras were nonfunctioning when this happened (Dec 2009)  clearly an inside job. Despite the fact that a camera, PDA and rental car were stolen, the management assumed no responsibility and did not even make the gesture of offering a refund of the cost of the stay.
