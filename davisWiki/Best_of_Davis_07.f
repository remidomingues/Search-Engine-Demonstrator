Every year during the winter quarter, the California Aggie holds a competition where UC Davis students and faculty are allowed to vote for their favorite Davis establishments and events.  Although the taste of some of these choices is questionable, it is interesting to see what the students like nonetheless.

Perhaps Best of Davis should be renamed to Most Popular of Davis.
