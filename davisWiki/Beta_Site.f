 Beta Site 

About
This picture is no longer representative because it is a small pond by now.  Its really too bad.
Unfortunately, Beta Site is a long since dead project, but the remnants of it still possibly exist where it once was.
Because of its questionable legality, the creators are not able to reveal the location.



20051022 16:58:11 nbsp Look into a http://cmms.cat.com/cmms/specgraphics/C055701.pdf 446D backhoe by www.cat.com Caterpillar. Then find a civil engineer who knows about gunite and rebar. Users/JasonAller

20051111 08:51:05 nbsp Seasonally, digging a hole in the fall around here results in a hole with rainwater in it. Good luck. Users/JasonAller

20051111 09:13:37 nbsp well, we hope to have the door + weather lining installed before the first big rain.  Thanks for the tip Though! Users/AlexNorris

20051111 13:20:08 nbsp It sounds like a cool idea, but is this legal? Users/GeoffJohnson

20051111 14:58:50 nbsp In response to GeoffJohnson, yes. Users/AlexNorris

20051113 20:49:13 nbsp Funny, I know of many male youth which have dug big holes. Must be some primal thing. Question is, what do you do with it once its finished? Users/SteveDavison

20051113 21:48:25 nbsp Beta Site is pretty much going to be a room or two undergroud. A place for sleepovers, hanging out, music writing, and acoustic shows. Its well underway now, as progress this weekend was very great. Users/JohnDudek

20051116 08:34:43 nbsp Daang N. Mouth u guys should have told me bout this. Let me know how I can help and Ill see what can be done. Users/JoshPelz

20051117 22:08:47 nbsp Mmm... If I had time and supplies Id help. If you guys need like publicizing or anything you think I could help with, give me a ring... or a comment Users/SamanthaSpada

20051118 17:47:05 nbsp publicizing it probably isnt the best plan right now,  davis wiki people can know about it sure, but if every one knew, and someone else figured out where it was, then they would do drugs there till the police found out.  so lets keep it on a downlowish basis right now. Users/DanielGonzales

20051118 22:06:07 nbsp Gah, not what i meant by publicizing. I meant like... try to get you guys help from people who you know... dont spend all their time on the wiki like we do Users/SamanthaSpada

20051118 23:03:33 nbsp Oh, then thats cool have fun with that, you should come look at our hole some time.  and we need to take a picture or us standing in it Users/DanielGonzales

20051119 18:05:15 nbsp Im sure the citys planning commission would have something to say about this. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051120 10:38:39 nbsp I dont think its OK to delete this page even ifyou created it. Is this hole legal? Does it fit the zoning ordinances? What about the environmental impact? I think the Davis community deserves to know. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051120 10:41:38 nbsp weve checked the environmental impact, Apollo, no problem there. As far as legality, where its at, Im sure its not illegal. Im just trying to keep this lowdown so nobody we dont like shows up. Thanks for your concern. Users/JohnDudek

20051120 12:03:36 nbsp What were worried about is that other holes in davis get taken over by people who use them for smoken the reefer and drinkin the bud, and then the police have to close it down.  We dont want that to happen to us, because this hole is a totally Strait Edge hole.  Thanks for your concern. Users/DanielGonzales

20051120 12:42:01 nbsp cmon, seriously...do you think some methhead is going to get on DavisWiki, see this, and automatically know where the hole is? If some druggie comes across your hole and uses it as his drug lair, it wont be because he heard of it here. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051120 13:04:41 nbsp well, we know some people who, if they get wind of this, WILL use it to smoke and stuff, so were just watching out. Users/JohnDudek

20051121 14:31:30 nbsp Whats this? Holes are now illegal because they could be used for someone to sit in and smoke weed? Why not make air illegal too? (whoops) Users/SteveDavison

20051121 22:02:11 nbsp Maybe air should be illegal... I hear it can give you cancer. Users/SamanthaSpada

20051121 22:14:40 nbsp If I had an underground lair, Id smoke weed in it.  What a waste of a good hole. Users/SummerSong

20051121 22:23:36 nbsp Sweet, this sounds like one of my childhood dreams come true. Users/RoyWright

20051122 00:45:04 nbsp so is this a hole or a tunnel? Seems to me a tunnel/subterranean lair would not be looked upon kindly by the city, whether you were smoking pot in it or having bible studies. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051122 00:58:57 nbsp HaHa. The comments conversation alone is awesome. Users/MichaelGiardina

20051122 09:25:17 nbsp it is a hole with a short tunnel. Clarified! Users/JohnDudek

20051122 11:22:45 nbsp photo! Users/ArlenAbraham

20051127 20:25:33 nbsp one word: wiki:WikiPedia:Buttress buttresses Users/ArlenAbraham

20051127 20:40:35 nbsp i say: fun in theory, dumb in reality. and where the heck is it, seriously.. in the pic it looks like its made out of ice. Users/AubreyJohnson

20051128 07:34:17 nbsp maybe it is... Users/AlexNorris

20051128 17:39:13 nbsp Guess what probably flooded like all hell today? Yeah... Beta Site. Probably. I havent checked yet, cant wait to slosh in that eight foot mud pit this week. Users/JohnDudek

20051128 21:36:55 nbsp I hope someone goes and checks on it toay, I want to see pictures of flooded/ not flooded beta site. Users/DanielGonzales

20051208 18:09:13 nbsp I have a dozen or so books on how to build underground houses.  You might look into the $50 and Up Underground House Book.  The website is http://www.undergroundhousing.com/ here, but you really want to get the book. Users/JabberWokky

20051208 21:37:41 nbsp Could you add the photo back?  I think it was pretty cool. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051210 17:57:47 nbsp haha, knew it! sorry though guys, ah well eh. thats the way the pumpkin rolls. Users/AubreyJohnson

20060109 15:57:30 nbsp Looks like at least a couple of cal/osha violations, what with no shoring and no confined entry rescue plan. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20060109 16:02:16 nbsp Since this isnt exactly an employer, how does cal/osha apply? Users/JaimeRaba

20060109 16:51:40 nbsp Is is your legal opinion that cal/osha does not apply? Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20080706 13:05:56 nbsp Did anyone ever find out where this was? Users/JoePomidor

20090506 18:37:43 nbsp Sorry, Joe, nobody will ever know where Beta Site was, Im afraid. Users/JohnDudek
