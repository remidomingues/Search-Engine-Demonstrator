20090223 21:11:34 nbsp Howdy, I just wanted to explain a bit of why I made the edits I did following your edits to the B&L Bike Shop page. I returned the thing about pricing to its former wording since that really reflects the views of the community better. It isnt necessarily true, it just states that some people believe it. The other part is that I attributed your responses. Since anyone can edit pretty much any part of the Wiki, commentary really doesnt mean anything more than the name thats attached to it. This means that comments from oneoff accounts with no user pages and one or two edits really dont carry the same weight as someone who has obviously spent some time on the Wiki and uses their name and all. This is even more true of comments with no attribution, because then they are really effectively worth nothing at all. Since nothing is really fixed, the only thing we all have here is our names.
