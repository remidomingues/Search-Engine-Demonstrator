Beth Freeman is technically a professor of English.  But shes wildly curious about many other things, and teaches herself new tech stuff when and if she can.  So this wikiworld is a new adventure for her.  You can take her classes in 19th century American literature and other fields in the English department, if youre so inclined.  Be prepared to encounter visual culture, cultural studies, gender/sexuality issues, interest in student ideas, MyUCDavis incorporated into the class, a decent memory for names, and bad handwriting.




20050620 00:40:10 nbsp haha nice to see you on the wiki, Dr. Freeman. i couldnt get in your ENL 188 class for fall (it was filled up), which is a disappointment... but maybe you could get me a PTA...? haha. Users/BrianChen

20080228 22:24:37 nbsp Hi Dr. Freeman!  You are on Davis Wiki!  We need more professor participation!    I took your gender & sexuality class and a couple of your 19th century lit classes circa 2001.  I loved your classes!  You forced us to ponder some provocative issues.

UCD Students:  I highly recommend that you try to take a class with Dr. Freeman, regardless of major.  Her classes are interesting and youll be better for it in the long run.     Users/CurlyGirl26
