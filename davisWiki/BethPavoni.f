Hey, Beth... keep in mind that Davis Wiki isnt a business listing site (it documents all of Davis, which is why we have pages about sunflowers and sidewalk crack project sidewalk cracks, plus happy fuzzy pets like Little Girl), plus it has a mandate to not be commercial in nature, and most entries about businesses on the wiki were made by the community  and all are always welcome to be edited by the community.  If you want, just start making pages for business!  Youll get lots of help from the large group of volunteers here!  Welcome to the wiki!

  Whups... I was just trying to help you out. If youre looking to make practice pages, by convention, they are in or under the Wiki Sand Box.  Try Wiki Sand Box/Smeagles Beagles. jw

20110526 13:57:07 nbsp Hey Beth, please take a moment to read over the Copyrights page.  Im guessing that tiger photo is one you found elsewhere, so it probably shouldnt be uploaded here. Users/TomGarberson

20110526 14:16:45 nbsp Gah, silly me! Sorry, I didnt even think of it. Still trying to figure out how to work all this. 0(  Thanks!  Users/BethPavoni

20110526 14:21:02 nbsp No worries :)  Have you checked out the wiki:Wikispot Help with Editing pages?  Theyre extremely useful, including the Help with Images linked there.  Its still a kinda complex system compared to the what you see is what you get stuff were used to these days, but theres new Wiki software in the works that should simplify things a lot at some point down the line.
