Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Betsy, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan Edwards, pleased to meet you!

Thanks for attempting to add an event, but it looks like you got a wee bit confused.  To add an event is slightly different than editing an entry.  You need to go to the Events Board, scroll down to the bottom of the page and then add the event using the form provided.  If you need to get a copy of the event you posted, you can retrieve it from the edit history by http://daviswiki.org/Events_Board?actionrecall&version85 clicking here.

It sounds like an interesting event... thanks for posting it, and once again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
