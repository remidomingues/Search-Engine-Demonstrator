It is important to note that Better Business Bureaus are funded by accredited businesses. Because BBB accreditation in good standing is valuable to businesses, there is some motivation for BBB accredited businesses to resolve consumer complaints amicably. While it is not necessary to first attempt selfresolution in business disputes, such attempts are looked upon favorably by both the Better Business Bureau and the court system, should the matter escalate. When a BBB receives a complaint, the complaint is presented to the business and the BBB stands as mediator. BBB accredited businesses must respond to consumer complaints presented by the BBB or lose their accreditation  most nonaccredited companies will cooperate with the BBB as well, so your complaint doesnt have to involve a BBB accredited business. Because the BBB has no enforcement authority aside from its agreement with accredited businesses, it can neither force a business to respond to complaints nor administer sanctions. However, a companys unwillingness to respond is noted in the companys reliability report the BBB provides to the public.
