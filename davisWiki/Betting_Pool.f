Quite possibly near the date Wes suggested.  Not that hes biased in posting this.)

BEWARE! THIS BETTING POOL IS CORRUPT! From #daviswiki:
<jraller> I liked your guess best of all on my 10,000th date
<hardaker> heh.
<jraller> Ill try for that, but the darn stats make it VERY hard to do
<hardaker> Ill give you a 54 inch piece of 300ohm antenna wire if you make it come true ;)
