Im really glad to see someone on here whos not in the 1825 age range and is a longterm resident of Davis.  Welcome!  Users/KenjiYamada

20041214 15:49:50 nbsp You didnt list This is Spinal Tap on your bit about the Christopher Guest movies. Another classic :)  Users/KenNeville

20041214 16:52:05 nbsp Believe it or not, Ive never seen Spinal Tap.  Users/BevSykes

20041214 17:27:36 nbsp Its a good movie.  There are many inside music jokes, but its accessable, similar to Best in Show having jokes that are dog lovers or dog show jokes but also being very accessable.  Users/JabberWokky

20041227 06:51:34 nbsp Hey Bev, I love your additions to the Mount Rushmore page. It amuses me that Gary Saylin and Bob Dunning have a feud going on. Dunning has mentioned Saylin in a recent column in a reference to Saylins letter to the Enterprise. Users/RobRoy

20050112 08:49:25 nbsp Hey, Bev  thanks for the updates.  I was curious about the GSA.  Is that a statewide organization?  Users/JabberWokky

20050322 22:33:10 nbsp Thanks so much for the recommendation of Midtown Animal Clinic.  A previously paralyzed mouse can walk now.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20050324 10:04:45 nbsp hi bev!  did you mean for that photo to become one of the random photos?  if so, Ill fix that up for you.   Users/CarlMcCabe

20050325 15:50:53 nbsp Your puppy photo is completely adorable! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050325 16:56:33 nbsp I added your pups photo to the Photography photo randomizer.  Great photo! Users/CarlMcCabe

20051031 22:11:54 nbsp Come back to the wiki, we need you!  And bring more older townies with you. Users/KenjiYamada

20051101 01:25:37 nbsp wiki misses bev sykes Users/TravisGrathwell

20051101 02:51:34 nbsp I agree, I think Bev and other nonstudents make some of the most valuable contributions. Users/MikeIvanov

20060325 14:41:22 nbsp A Steve Schalchlin quote?! Wow, this is the first Last Session reference i have heard since moving out of LA. my uncle is the producer of that amazing musical. how did you come across it? Users/AdamGerber

20060621 22:48:50 nbsp yeah, I think a better word than haunted to describe the Varsity is.. inhabited. Its not like theres anybody like trying to scare any employees or anything, but just it always feels like someone else is there, hanging out.  I really love looking at old pictures of the varsity, back when lawsuit used to play there and stuff.  It makes me wish I lived here (im davis) in the 90s.  You should definitely come by sometime.  I would love to hear some cool stories about the Varsity! Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20061024 13:29:44 nbsp I just rediscovered Lawsuits music through their website.  My family went to St. James with you all and I will never forget the first time I saw Lawsuit playing at Picnic Day.  When I downloaded the MP3s from the Lawsuit Graveyard website, and North Dakotachrome came on, I was bombarded with so many happy memories of Davis at once.  Picturebook Pretty is one of the most joyful songs I have ever heard.  My sister went to DHS with Paul and I was saddened by his loss.  I just wanted to tell you that I am so glad he continues to live on through his music.  I hope all is well! Users/AdamFlowers

20061203 22:02:51 nbsp like adam (hi adam!), i grew up around the sykes kids and was a big fan of lawsuit, i just discovered the lawsuit page and bevs tribute to paul last friday. i had no idea the downtown plaza stage had a mekmorial for paul, so i went there this afternoon and remembered paul. his music got me through a lot of jr. high and high school agnst, and his concerts were truly a thing of beauty. thanks for raising him to be such a good person, bev, its good to see you building things on the wiki. Users/SeanMarsh

20070101 01:43:16 nbsp Thanks, both Sean and Adam, for your nice comments. Users/BevSykes

20070316 19:10:20 nbsp Dont let problems on Recent Changes drive you away from the wiki. The community of editors that make positive contributions is much larger than the few who cause problems. It would be a shame too be without your input. Users/JasonAller

20070621 09:57:09 nbsp Is there a way to get the Lawsuit Graveyard back up? Users/JamesSchwab

20110216 21:45:37 nbsp Its great to see you editing again! Users/WilliamLewis

20110318 12:44:00 nbsp I forwarded your review to Eva, wife and coowner of the Little Prague Restaurant and hope that you will all be able to sit down and discuss this issue.  I know that the Riggity Jig band will be playing again at Little Prague shortly and hope you are able to visit to see them play once again.  I believe they will be playing at the Little Prague Bar (not the restaurant). Users/WesP

20110318 13:03:48 nbsp Oof!  What a mistake on their part!  You can stay at home for food (my wife and I had lamb chops at home for St. Patricks Day).  People go out for a variety of reasons, and the band was there specifically to draw customers looking for live music and a meal.  The problem is simple: they did not provide what they were advertising and that you specifically ordered well before you arrived.  Its as if you ordered shepherds pie and they brought you mashed potatoes.  Best of luck in catching them in the future. Users/JabberWokky

20110804 17:14:53 nbsp Bevs kids were (and are) the coolest, most talented people Ive ever had the pleasure to have met and admire. Users/OldDavis73
