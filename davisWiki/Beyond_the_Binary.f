  •    What It Is That We Do: 4PM5PM @ Garrison Room
Looking beyond the binary gives us a chance to learn about other forms of sexuality.  For many people, BDSM  bondage, discipline, dominance/submission, and sadomasochism  offers a different and compelling way to express love, lust and affection.  Through consciously and carefully playing with power, control, and even pain, some lovers find themselves closer and more fulfilled. Come learn about the practices, language, hearts and minds of happily selfproclaimed perverts and see if you find out something surprising!

    •    NonTraditional Relationship/Family Structure: 45PM @ The Garrison Room (MU)
Just like homo and heterosexuality are only two of a vast number of sexual orientations, so also are coupled and single only two of a vast number of ways to relate to loved ones.  Monogamy doesnt work for everyone, and many people have chosen to negotiate different kinds of commitments with their loved ones, including open (nonmonogamous) relationships and polyamory (being openly, consensually in love with more than one partner at the same time).  Please join us for a discussion about the many ways that people come together and make families of every kind imaginable!

Bisexuals @ Play: BDSM as a Bi Pleasure Practice
Keynote Speaker: Amy André

MU II
Kinky sex has something unique to offer bisexuals and nonbisexuals alike, when it comes to understandings of the body as a site of pleasure. One thing that many BDSMenthusiasts and bisexuals have in common is a nongendered/ nongenitalspecific approach to desire and its manifestations. In this interactive keynote, we’ll be exploring the intersections of BDSM and bisexuality both figuratively… and literally.
