Bharatanatyam, classical Indian dance, originated in the temples of South India over 4,000 years ago. This art form is an integral part of South Indias rich heritage and is practiced around the world. Bharatanatyam is an allinclusive dance form with intricate foot work, graceful hand gestures, and subtle facial expressions.

In Davis, you can learn the basics of Bharatanatyam through the Experimental College with instructor Venita Katir, at the EC Dance room on Thursday 810 pm. All are welcome regardless of dancing experience. The beginner and intermediate classes will build your stamina and flexibility as well as inform you about some of South Indias rich dance tradition.

Venita is teaching a theory/history class on Bharatanatyam through the EC (Spring 2006). NEW!! She will also be teaching a theory class as a Freshman Seminar in Fall 2007, which will cover a wider range of topics on Indian culture.

Our performance on March 3rd, 2006 at the Veterans Memorial Center, as part of a fundraiser organized by http://home.pacbell.net/easan/Lest/Lest_We_Forget.html Lest We Forget was a great success! Many thanks to everyone for your support, and to Venita for all her effort!
