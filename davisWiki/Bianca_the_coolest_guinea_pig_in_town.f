Bianca is a fully trained guinea pig. Potty trained, comes when called, goes into her cage on command and does your Chemistry Homework. Image(Bianca2.jpg, thumbnail)  How many of your dogs can do the same?? Plus shes down to party with the new dog Allie, the smartest puppy in Davis Allie They are best buds. She will do anything for lettuce, and she likes to chew on power cords.  She was nearly electricuted once and didnt even notice the flying blue sparks.

If you have anything bad to say about her she will cute you to death.
