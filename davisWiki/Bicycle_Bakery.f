20090626 13:57:46 nbsp I dont think that their carrot cake is actually vegan because of the cream cheese. Unless it is not actually cream cheese. Users/ScottWong
    They dont actually use creamcheese; many vegan recipes call for something like http://www.tofutti.com/btcc.shtml Toffuttis Better Than Cream Cheese tofu based substitute. My girlfriend once made a vegan pumpkin cheesecake that was actually pretty darn tasty! Users/Edwins ES

20090812 17:06:58 nbsp We thoroughly enjoyed a wonderful chocolate cake at a birthday party.  Everyone raved about its deliciousness and the fact it was vegan.  I would give one warning to other parents, though, that our child has never been overstimulated for hours like she was after eating the cake.  Perhaps it was the amount of chocolate?  At any rate, great job.  It would be great to see the products in the Davis Food CoOp and/or the Nugget markets. Users/MrsC

20090825 15:22:34 nbsp I tried to find Bicycle Bakery in Davis...I got a piece of their heavenly chocolate brownie cake at Whole Foods in Sacramento and I wanted to be able to get their yummy gluten free oat bars without driving 20 miles each way (although they are worth it!)  Finally, I called and they said even though their commercial kitchen in in downtown Davis, they havent found any retail outlets in Davis to take on their products...too bad...so if you call them you can special order and arrange for pick up or delivery. Fast turnaround time, too.    Users/shanta

20100117 18:42:59 nbsp I am not a vegan, but I love these delicious and healthier  highquality baked treats and breakfast eats!  Im so happy that some of Bicycle Bakerys goods are now being sold here in Davis where they are also made and no longer need to travel all the way to whole foods!  Some of my favorites are the tasty and energizing cranberry, chocolate chip/coconut and maple pecan oat bars.  I love to have them for breakfast or quick snacks.   I wish that my two favorites,  the delicious carrot and chocolate cakes were carried here, but Im definitely happy to find my second favorite the peanut butter cookies here in Davis!  YUM!!! Users/Opal

20100117 18:45:33 nbsp Oh, and I also want to mention that the cake that my friend ordered for her moms birthday was both gorgeous and delicious!  The owner, Shannon was really kind and delivered it right to her place!  It was chocolate with two layers! Users/Opal

20100205 20:08:29 nbsp I found this bakery by being shown the pastries at Kaiser S Sac....the cafe owner showed us after I asked if a vegan drink was good.  Ive been on a strict antiinflammatory diet and am sensitive to gluten.  We were so happy to finally find a safe treat that is local.  We will look for your products at Whole Foods that is near us in the San Joaquin County. Users/Annasan51

20100610 20:01:41 nbsp Im the owner of Bicycle Bakery and pleased to announce that Ive outgrown my kitchen space in Davis!!  The chocolate brownie cake and pineapple walnut carrot cake have become so popular that I just couldnt keep up with the demand.  I found a baking production company that follows my recipes to the teaspoon and guarantees the onebatchatatime quality youve come to love.
