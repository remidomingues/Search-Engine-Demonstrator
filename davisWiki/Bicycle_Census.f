The Official Bicycle Census of DavisWiki


Davis reputedly has 2.1 Bicycles bikes per person. On occasion, youll see some person riding a bike while holding another (riderless) bike alongside (ghostriding). Maybe thats what this is about. Why ride just one bike, when you can go biking with all of your 2.1 bikes? It is unlikely to be an incidence of bike theft since that would be an incredibly stupid and slow way to do such a thing.

Regardless, it is our duty as the wikizens of Davis to establish the veracity of this claim of 2.1 bikes per person. Naturally, we should do so in the most unscientific way possible. So, please state how many bicycles you own and their names. Everyone names their bike(s), right?

Every ten comments has a following tally of Wikizens/Number of Bikes Owned. If, after your original comment, you lose your bike, buy three more, and/or have a baby and decide to update the Census, please remember to also change your sections totals.  You can also go the extra step and update The Results ratio below.

 Rules And Regulations 
  Rule 100232 (Regarding Tandems)  Although tandems count as one bicycle, two or more persons may count this as their bicycle.

  Rule 203436 (Regarding Kid Attachments)  Kid attachments may be counted providing they have pedals and handlebars.
