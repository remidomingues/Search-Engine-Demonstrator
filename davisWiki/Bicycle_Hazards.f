This page is a catalog of major Bicycling bicycling hazards and inconveniences in Davis.   Most of these are things that the City of Davis city or university should fix.  Workarounds for bicyclists are also discussed because a public works solution could be expensive, or may take time, or in a few cases there may not be any clear engineering solution.  The city is beginning to add shared use markers or sharrows to areas of downtown where frequent hazards make it safer to ride out in the lane, away from opening doors and diagonally parked vehicles that may back out without visibility.

To bring a hazard or issue to the attention of City of Davis City staff, please visit http://cityofdavis.org/crm/. You can enter in the issue and characterize it if possible. This request system should not be used for emergency or serious problems. Call 911 for emergencies or the City after hours support line 5307475400.

Also, while the city bicycling hazards are an important topic, you should also remember the most important bicycling safety step that you control:  Wear a Bicycle Helmets helmet.

 City Hazards 

 1st Street at Aggie Village 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?fq&sources_q&hlen&geocode&q1st+and+c,+davis,+ca+95616&sll38.54152,121.742801&sspn0.001055,0.002272&ieUTF8&ll38.541587,121.742871&spn0.00211,0.004544&z18&iwlocaddr Map) Between B and D Streets, the bike path on the South side of 1st Street passes through an avenue that is nearly completely unlit at night, directly in front of several residential porches. Pedestrians and bikes without lights are nearly invisible at night. Mature olive trees hide cyclists from traffic on 1st  and hide 1st Street traffic from cyclists. The tiny, nearly hidden Yield signs on the bike path at C St. completely fail to communicate to cyclists that they do not have the right of way, and that their lives are at serious risk if they proceed through the intersection without very careful examination of largely hidden traffic from four directions.

Workaround: Avoid this bike path as a potential death trap. Instead, take the welllit and carfree path that runs South of Aggie Village.

Solution: This bike path cannot be rescued without taking out two blocks of heritage olive trees. Instead, restripe 1st Street with bicycle lanes and employ traffic calming measures to stop cars from treating this part of downtown like a highway on/off ramp. Turn the bike path into a sidewalk. In the interim, post signs warning that this is a blind intersection.

 8th Street at G Street 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?&ll38.551608,121.741146&spn0.001355,0.001813&th&z19 Map) The pavement and gutter on the north side of 8th Street (near G Street) are crushed and uneven, and the bicycle lane is relatively narrow.  This is a busy throughway for both bicycles and motor vehicles.

Solution: This section of the street should be properly repaved.

Workaround: Bike slowly and pay attention.  There is no other simple route across the train tracks near this intersection.

 Arthur Street and Russell Boulevard 

Problems: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.546424,121.770583&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The traffic lights at this intersection are ad hoc for bicyclists.  First, there are no traffic signals with the special bicycle symbols.  Clearly the lamps that face south should have bicycle symbols since they are only for bicyclists.  But there should also be bicycle lamps that face north for bicyclists coming from Arthur Street.   A separate but related problem is that when bicyclists or pedestrians ask for a signal from the bike path on the south, bicyclists on Arthur Street are made to wait for no reason.  Many bicyclists are in a hurry to get to school and cross at this time anyway.

Solution: The less expensive solution would be to change the lenses in the signals that face south, and to change the timing of the intersection so that bicyclists can cross in both directions when they can cross going north.  The more expensive solution would be to add extra bicycle lamps that face north.

Workaround: None.

 Anderson Road and Russell Boulevard 

Problems: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.546376,121.758815&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The bicycle left turn lane on the north side of the intersection is highly exposed to motor vehicles.  Moreover, the southeast right turn lane from La Rue to Russell has limited visibility; drivers have trouble seeing bicyclists in both directions (see below).  Many students and employees use this intersection to get to and from campus.

Solution: The intersection should be redesigned somehow to be safe for bicyclists.

Workaround: Cross Russell at either Sycamore or Oak Avenue instead.

 B Street between E. 7th & E. 8th St. 
Problems: (http://maps.google.com/maps?q740+b+street,+davis,+ca&hlen&ll38.550255,121.746272&spn0.000743,0.000841&sll38.56112,121.767111&sspn0.000743,0.000841&vpsrc6&hnear740+B+St,+Davis,+California+95616&th&z20 Map) This is the section immediately south of E. 8th and B St.  Pavement in both narrow directions is loose, potholed and distressed.  The bike lanes are almost nonexistent and a utility pole is between the sidewalk and the car lane in the southbound direction.  This section is a bottleneck between Davis High School and downtown and is further complicated by car parking that has no restrictions here.  Residents and UC students vie for the few open spaces and a bus stop in the middle of the block makes site distance problematic.

Solution:  City Staff has this block on their list of budgeted projects for year 2013.

Workaround:  Use A Street when possible.

 Covell Boulevard and Highway 113 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.56112,121.767111&spn0.000731,0.00105&th&z20 Map) The stop light for bicyclists on the bike path crossing the entrance ramp to 113 North is not a bicycle traffic.  Instead, it is a normal traffic light with a blind so that the cars dont see it.

Solution: The light should be replaced by a bicycle traffic light.

Workaround: Remember that that light is for bicyclists even though it isnt standard for Davis.

 Covell Boulevard and J and L Streets 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?&ll38.56058,121.738607&spn0.000677,0.000907&th&z19 Map) Three of the four crosswalks to cross the turn lanes make sharp angles with the bicycle paths and the ramps are also steep.  The turns are not realistic for bicyclists at moderate speeds.

Solution: Both ramps and crosswalks on J and the east ramp on L should be rebuilt to look more like the west ramp on L.  They cannot look exactly like that because the paths continue south, but they could have a T intersection with rounded corners and a gentler grade.

Workaround: Slow down well before you approach the crosswalks at J and L streets.  Especially for the west ramp on J, by the time you see the problem its too late.

 H Street to J Street tunnel 

Problems: (http://maps.google.com/maps?th&ieUTF8&ll38.558258,121.742309&spn0.000732,0.000903&z20 Map) The H Street Bike Tunnel bicycle tunnel under the train tracks here was built as an expansion of an existing drainage culvert, at relatively low cost.  The biggest problem is that the entrance to the tunnel on the west side is boxed in with sharp turns.  The tunnel itself is also low and corrugated, and the riding surface can be slippery.  Many children use this tunnel to get to and from school.

Solution: The easiest partial solution is to add a convex mirror on the west side to help prevent collisions.  A second improvement would be to replace the gravel slope on the side of the ramps with a retaining wall to create more room.  Ideally the tunnel itself would be rebuilt, perhaps as part of a major restructuring of storm drainage (which would probably have to involve the pumps between the Little League fields and the Covell Blvd. overcrossing, and the slough to the north).

Workaround: Bike slowly into this tunnel.  Stay on your side of the bike path.  Look for opposing traffic when entering or leaving the west side of the tunnel and use your bell or horn to warn hidden oncoming bikes of your presence.

 Hampton Drive 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.554706,121.771933&spn0.000766,0.000996&th&z20 Map) The speed bumps on Hampton Drive have cuts in strange places.  There is no safety merit to making bicyclists go over these obtrusive speed bumps, but instead of being in the bicycle lanes, the cuts are in the road so that it is easy for half of a cars wheels to go through a cut.  Cars are tempted to swerve to avoid the cuts, while cyclists are tempted to swerve to bike through the cuts.  Neither practice is safe for cars or bicyclists.

Solution: The speed bumps should be redone so that they go all the away across for cars, and so that they dont extend into the bicycle lanes.

Workaround: If there arent parked cars in the way, you can avoid the speed bumps by swerving to the curb instead of to the middle of the street.

 Montgomery Avenue 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.53896,121.710743&spn0.001464,0.001805&th&z19 Map) Montgomery Avenue has no proper bicycle lane between Meadowbrook Drive and Danbury Avenue.  The road has some significant traffic.  Most bicycle fatalities in and near Davis have been highspeed collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles moving in the same direction (see Tragic Events).

Solution: The entire street should have a bicycle lane.

Workaround: Use the Putah Creek Park bicycle path instead, or cut across to it.

 Oak Avenue 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.549487,121.752761&spn0.000678,0.000907&th&z20 Map) The city dug a halfmile trench in the bike lane on the east side of Oak Avenue, from California to Villanova.  The trench was repaved, but the new pavement was not smoothed properly.  Bicyclists are tempted to ride in the street or in the car parking area.


Solution: Oak Avenue should be repaved properly.

Workaround: When going north, go on B street instead or connect to it.

 Olive Drive and L Street 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.544601,121.733378&spn0.000766,0.000996&th&z20 Map) There is no direct access across the railroad tracks from Olive Drive to L Street. Cyclists on Olive Drive are tempted to carry bicycles over the tracks to the corner of 2nd and L.  At least four pedestrians have been killed by trains along the half mile of track from L street to Kendall Way (see Tragic Events).

Solution: A bicycle tunnel, either from Olive to L or from Hickory Lane to 2nd Street, is the only reasonable solution.  The track should also be fenced from J Street to Pole Line.



Workaround: Find the patience to go through the Richards Boulevard tunnel and then downtown instead.  This is not safe either, because there are a lot of cars along this route.  But even though it carries more risk of a minor accident, it carries less risk of a fatal accident.  There is a real chance of getting killed by a train, but there is no record of bicyclists or pedestrians getting killed in downtown Davis.

 Pole Line Road and 5th Street 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.548607,121.726276&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) Cars in the right turn lane in the southeast corner of the intersection have trouble seeing bicyclists coming from the post office.

Solution: Add yield or warning signs for both the cars and the bicyclists.

Workaround: Look carefully to the left, up Pole Line road, before crossing the right turn lane if you are biking from the post office or if you are biking west on 5th Street.

 Richards Boulevard over I80 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.540328,121.736991&spn0.011715,0.014441&th&z16 Map) If you are going south through the bicycle tunnel, and especially if you are travelling west on Cowell, then the safe way to cross the freeway is to turn onto Olive Drive or Research Park Drive and then go use the tunnel under the freeway.  But many bicyclists dont know this.

Solution: Add signs that direct bicyclists to the freeway tunnel.

Workaround: Know to use the freeway tunnel anyway.

 Road 32A 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.558911,121.669408&spn0.001464,0.001805&th&z19 Map) Road 32A connects Davis to the Yolo Causeway going to Sacramento for bicyclists.  This road has some highspeed traffic and either no bicycle lanes or deteriorated, narrow lanes.  Most bicycle fatalities in and near Davis have been highspeed collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles moving in the same direction (see Tragic Events).  The worst section of this stretch from Covell to Road 105 has recently been repaved with wide lanes and is now much safer.  105 to the Causeway is still fairly narrow and should be used with some caution.

Solution: Build bike lanes to the same standard as within city limits, or better yet, a separated bike path.

Workaround: None, if you want to bike to Sacramento.  Wear highvisibility clothing and dont take this route at night.

 Road 99 

Problem: Road 99 does not meet minimum safety standards for bicyclists.  A bicyclist was killed on this road because of high speeds and lack of room (see Tragic Events).

Solution: The city of Davis is aware that there is no safe bicycle route from Woodland to Davis and it is laying plans to make one.  In the meantime, it might make a lot of sense for motor vehicles as well to reduce speeds on some of the mile grid roads that run parallel to Highway 113 anyway.  These roads are among the most dangerous for motor vehicles in Yolo County as well as for cyclists.

Workaround: Road 102 may not be quite as terrible as Road 99 to get from Woodland to Davis.  However, it should not be considered a safe alternative.  Certainly you shouldnt bike on these roads in the dark.

 Road 102 (Extension of Pole Line) 

Problem: Road 102 is not safe for bicyclists once Pole Line ends.

Solution: The city of Davis is aware that there is no safe bicycle route from Woodland to Davis and it is laying plans to make one.  In the meantime, it might make a lot of sense for motor vehicles as well to reduce speeds on some of the mile grid roads that run parallel to Highway 113 anyway.  These roads are among the most dangerous for motor vehicles in Yolo County as well as for cyclists.

Workaround: None.  Dont use this route in the dark.

 Russell Boulevard west of Arthur Street 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.54664,121.785639&spn0.001464,0.001805&th&z19 Map) There are no traffic lights or stop signs along the twomile stretch of Russell Boulevard Russell west of Arthur Street.  It is tricky for bicyclists to cross the street safely.  The trees interfere with visibility for motor vehicles on Russell.  At night, sometimes the easiest way for a driver to see bicyclists is the flicker that they create in the headlights of oncoming cars.

Solution: Several intersections along this road should have traffic lights.  At the very least Lake Boulevard should have one.

Workaround: Be patient when crossing Russell.  Look both ways.  When crossing at night, make sure that your bicycle has proper lights and reflectors.

 Shasta Drive and Olympic Drive 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.555441,121.776272&spn0.000766,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The bicycle lane inexplicably disappears in the traffic circle on Shasta Drive at the intersection with Olympic Drive.

Solution: Rebuild the sidewalk and curb to make room for a bike lane.

Workaround: Look behind you to see if a car is coming before entering the south side of the traffic circle.

 Sycamore Lane at Villanova Drive 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.556417,121.765007&spn0.001355,0.001813&th&z19 Map) What looks like a simple T at Sycamore and Villanova is actually a 200footlong intersection that also involves Brown Drive and a bike path in Sycamore Park.  Visibility and rightofway are both tricky for bicyclists.  Many children go through this intersection to go to and from school.

Solution: The intersection should be redesigned somehow. One proposal is to make Brown Drive a J instead of a U by closing the south intersection with Sycamore to cars. It would be possible to continue bike, pedestrian, and emergency access. This would be a major change for residents of Brown, but they would still be able to drive up to the northern intersection with Sycamore. This would simplify the intersection, although connecting from the bike path to Villanova would still be a problem.



Workaround: If you are going west on Villanova, stop and look far to the right as well as to the left.  The stop at Brown Drive is set back 100 feet from where you are.  If you are going east through Sycamore Park, then one solution, even though it is still dubious in light of traffic rules, is to bike 50 feet north on the left side of Sycamore, then cross at  the striped crosswalk.  Another option is to turn left in Sycamore Park to connect to Brown Drive, then get  to Sycamore from Brown Drive and turn left onto Villanova.  If you want to enter the bike path in Sycamore Park, check for bicyclists that may be leaving the path at high speed.

 Villanova Drive at Anderson Road 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.556179,121.758627&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The yellow light is too short for bicyclists to cross Anderson Road Anderson.  The bicycle call button summons a pedestrian walk cycle, which is a partial solution but not enough.  Many children ride bicycles on Villanova to get to and from school.

Solution: The yellow light should be lengthened, and then the bicycle call button should summon a vehicle light cycle rather than a pedestrian cycle.

Workaround: If you see a green light turn yellow at this intersection when you are on Villanova, you wont make it across.  In fact, if you see a green light at all, you probably wont make it unless you are very close to the intersection.  Instead, slow down and press the bicycle call button.



 Villanova Drive at Carob Place 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.556073,121.754622&spn0.001464,0.001805&th&z19 Map) At the S curve in Villanova Drive Villanova, the sidewalk is wide and the Bike Lanes bicycle lane is narrow on the north side.  Moreover, motor vehicles have less room than usual because the street is divided.  Buses in particular have barely enough room.  Many children ride bicycles on Villanova to get to and from school.

Solution: The sidewalk should be rebuilt to make more room in both the motor vehicle lane and the bicycle lane.

Workaround: Ride single file and slow down.  Another workaround is to ride on the sidewalk; the wide sidewalk once was the only place in Davis that allowed bicycles to ride on it, as a bicycle lane.  But it is still important to slow down because riding on the sidewalk has its own hazards.

 Public school site issues 

 Bicycle racks at all public schools 

Problem: The bicycle racks at all public schools in Davis are primitive and range from crowded to badly overcrowded.  Many students would like to bicycle to school, but its no fun to get hemmed in between many other bicycles, nor to have to worry about bicycle theft.

Solution: Davis Joint Unified School District should expand and improve bicycle racks at its public schools until all students who bicycle can park comfortably and safely even on days with great weather.

Workaround: None.

 Birch Lane Elementary access 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.560709,121.725791&spn0.005856,0.007982&th&z17 Map) None of the main streets around Birch Lane are marked with bicycle lanes.  Students on bicycles mix unsafely with cars on Birch Lane and Temple Drive in particular.  Whittier Drive and Baywood Lane are other problem streets.

Solution:  A complete solution is not so easy because some of the streets may not be wide enough to support both street parking and full bicycle lanes.  Is traffic abatement on Temple a possibility?

Workaround: None.

 Cesar Chavez Elementary through traffic 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.554207,121.75872&spn0.001464,0.001996&th&z19 Map) Adult bicyclists on Anderson mix unsafely with cars at the beginning and end of the school day in front of Cesar Chavez.

Solution: Unclear.  Maybe the schools traffic guards could be deployed differently to help with this problem.

Workaround: Connect to Oak Street via Villanova when going south on Anderson.  Or take Rutgers to Oeste to Antioch to Oak.

 Davis Senior High traffic 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.555713,121.750346&spn0.001531,0.001797&th&z19 Map )14th Street from B Street to Oak Avenue is congested with an unsafe mixture of buses, cars, and bicycles in the morning and after school.  In the afternoon the problem extends to bicyclists coming from Holmes Junior High.

Solution: The high school could make a separated bike path for bicyclists from the bike parking rack to near corner of 14th and Oak. It should have a forked termination, with one branch ending on Oak that could be used to get to school, and the other branch emptying into the bike lane just before the intersection to go home from school.  Other new routes should also be studied, and the high school might also make good use of traffic monitors when school starts and ends.  Or relocation of bike parking could change or eliminate the problem for high school students.  Its less clear what to do for Holmes students.

Workaround:  None.

 Holmes Junior High west traffic 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.557282,121.739073&spn0.003062,0.003594&th&z18 Map) The Drexel bike path west of the main buildings is old and incomplete.  As a remedy, students are asked to park in the west lot if they live west of Holmes, but the west bike lot is smaller and more crowded than the main one on the east.

Solution: This bike path should be repaved and widened, and it should be extended all the way to the east bike lot.  The path would ideally be offset from the curb so that bicycle traffic does not interfere with car pickup.

Workaround: Nothing that the traffic monitors dont already tell the kids to do.  If you live south or even southwest of campus, you should avoid the mess on Drexel by using L Street instead.  Menlo Drive to Hemlock is also an option from certain directions.

 UC Davis campus 

 Bainer Hall and Roessler Hall 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.537183,121.752222&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The corner of Bainer Hall that points to Roessler is a sharp turn for bicyclists with limited visibility.  The placement of the drain also makes this space slippery for bicyclists.

Solution: This space should be redesigned to be safe for bicyclists.  The easiest partial solution would be a convex mirror opposite the corner of Bainer.

Workaround: There are three ways to go past Roessler Hall to get to MSB, South California, and various engineering buildings.  The path across the front of Bainer has the least visibility and the sharpest turns.  You can instead go across the north side of Roessler, or between Roessler and Physics/Geology.

 California Avenue traffic circles 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.542548,121.753039&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) California Avenue is cambered for drainage as most roads are, but this creates a reverse bank in the traffic circles.  It is then easier for bicyclists to fall when turning in these traffic circles.

Solution: Drainage in the traffic circles should be changed.  Ideally there would be a drain in the middle of each of these traffic circles and the camber could be eliminated or reversed.  Even without this, some portions of these traffic circles have more camber than necessary.

Workaround: Slow down in the traffic circles.  This is something that you should do anyway.

 UC Davis Arboretum, east end 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.540008,121.74218&spn0.000766,0.000899&th&z20 Map) The south fork of the Putah Creek bike path ends at some industrial buildings, an unsafe train crossing, and then private property.  There has been a fatal accident at this train crossing (see Tragic Events).


Solution: The campus and local property owners should mark the directions that most bicyclists shouldnt go, and it should pave the 50foot dirt stretch that connects to the north fork of the path and the good path for commuters.

Workaround: Dont follow the south fork of the bike path all the way to the end; it isnt useful except to get to the east edge of Solano Park.  If you do find yourself there, dont go over the train tracks because it is there is only private property on the other side, and it isnt a safe crossing either.  Instead, cross the dirt stretch to get to the north side.

 La Rue north tunnel 

Problem:  (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.54461,121.759423&spn0.001464,0.001805&th&z19 Map) Both the tunnel and the eastbound ramp have rough pavement.  This tunnel is a very busy throughway for bicyclists and the rough pavement creates a direct risk of a crash.  After the tunnel, cyclists are tempted to edge towards opposing traffic to avoid the bumps, which creates additional hazards.  The asphalt around the sewer cover on the ramp is the single worst spot.

Solution: Repave the tunnel floor and the ramp to the east of the tunnel.

Workaround: Nothing all that great.  Pay attention and dont bike too fast when you go up the east ramp, even though the ramp is steep.  Do not veer onto the left half of the ramp, but dont go to the right of the last sewer cover because the pit there is bad.

 La Rue and Russell 

Problem:  (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.546075,121.758535&spn0.000732,0.000903&th&z20 Map) The right turn from northbound LaRue to eastbound Russell is marked with 2 yields; the first to yield to the bike path and the second to yield to the cars on Russell.    This first yield is clearly ambiguous for automobiles and thus becomes a hazard for cyclists.  Most disturbing are the southbound Anderson cyclists turning left on the bike path.   Also, westbound and northbound bikes pile up at the triangle during peak hours.

Solution:  As of 11/02/08, UCD TAPS is considering three solutions in response to cyclists concerns.  (1) Temporary signs to emphasize the yield to turning cars.  (2) A longer right turn stop light so that right turning cars will yield generally but stop when the Anderson south/eastbound left turn arrow is engaged.  (3) Reconfigure the right turn: Remove the triangle and yield, and ultimately reconfigure the bike path east of the intersection.  This would force the cars turning right to come to a full stop before making the turn.   It would also remove the issue of bicycles queueing on the triangle and blocking other bicycle traffic.

Workaround: If you are coming from the Russell bike path, slow down and look carefully down La Rue for cars turning right.  If you are coming from Anderson, there is no workaround.

 UC Davis Arboretum / Lake Spafford 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.537701,121.746519&spn0.006126,0.007188&th&z17 Map) Stretches of the bike paths alongside North Putah Creek and Lake Spafford are narrow and provide little protection from falling into the creek.  The worst spots are under the bridges, such as the Mrak Hall Drive bridge.

Solution: The dangerous parts of these paths should either be closed to bicycle traffic, or they should be set up with guard fencing to keep bicyclists from falling into the creek.  A few of the sharp turns should also be redesigned to make more room.  Some of the ramps are also quite steep and they should either be redesigned, or closed to bicycle traffic, or warnings should be posted for bicyclists.

Workaround: The Putah Creek path is fun, but it is not necessary to commute to campus.  A safe and easy path runs parallel to the Putah Creek paths, from the train tunnel to Hutchison Drive.   If you do want to enjoy the Putah Creek path by bike, dont try to enjoy it at night.  In addition to being narrow and unguarded, parts are also poorly lit.

 South California Avenue extension 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.536818,121.752092&spn0.001464,0.001797&th&z19 Map) The bike path just past the end of South California Avenue, and around the west side of Roessler, has rough pavement.  Moreover, this stretch is poorly lit at night.

Solution: Repave this part of the campus bike path system, and possibly add one more lamp.  It appears that the part of South California Avenue that cars can use has been repaved much more recently than the part north of the posts.

Workaround: Nothing other than to bike slowly in this spot.  It is also near the problem area between Bainer and Roessler.

 Traffic circle at Housing Admin and Soccer Field 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.542759,121.756201&spn0.001355,0.001813&th&z20 Map) The triangles on the south and east side of this traffic circle are too wide, so that eastbound traffic and traffic from the south crosses instead of merging.  This defeats the function of a traffic circle.

Solution: The triangles should be made smaller.  Ideally the intersection would be reshaped to create more functional traffic space.

Workaround: Slow down when entering the south half of the traffic circle.  Traffic here is predictably hazardous between classes.

 Inconveniences 

 Covell Boulevard 

Problem: The bike path on the north side of Covell from Sycamore to F Street is old.  It has a lot of tree roots and some also some pits and potholes.

Solution: The bike path should be repaved.  There are modern engineering methods, for instance porous asphalt, that in some situations can reduce the conflict between these paved paths and tree roots.

Workaround: The bike path on the south side of Covell, where it exists, is in much better condition.  Many bicyclists use the bicycle lanes on Covell instead, which is a fast and smooth alternative.  However, most bicycle fatalities in Davis are highspeed collisions between motor vehicles and bicycles travelling in the same direction (see Tragic Events), and one of these (Peter G. Kauffman) was on West Covell.

 F Street and Villanova 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.557013,121.743297&spn0.000677,0.000907&th&z20 Map) The safe way to turn left from F Street to Villanova is to use the pedestrian call button.  But the button is set too far away from the street and newspaper boxes are in front of it.

Solution: Add another button for bicyclists.

Workaround: Use the curb cut there to get to the button, then complete a 3point Uturn to cross the street.

 Marketplace Shopping Center 

Problem: The bicycle racks are too small, many of them have too little room, and they are the less secure, oldfashioned variety.

Solution: Whoever controls The Marketplace should install the modern slanted racks, like the ones in Oak Tree Plaza, with enough room to park comfortably.

Workaround: None.  The rack on the south side of Longs Drugs at least has more room.

 Marketplace Shopping Center and Oak Tree Plaza 

Problem: It is easy for bicyclists to mix with parking lot traffic in both of these shopping centers.

Solution: Whoever controls The Marketplace and Oak Tree Plaza should mark routes for bicycles.

Workaround: Bike around the edge of the parking lot instead of through the middle.  Curb cuts from the Covell bike path to the corners of The Marketplace lot are available at Big 5 Sporting Goods and at Panda Express.

At Oak Tree Plaza, there is an important curb cut in the back that connects Nugget bike parking to Claremont Drive.  Otherwise bike around the edge; if coming from the west on Covell, use the first motor vehicle entrance.  If coming from the east on Covell, use the entrance next to Longs Drugs.  From Pole Line you can use this entrance or enter from Claremont.

 Putah Creek Park bike path and I80 tunnel 

Problem: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.537903,121.7352&spn0.005858,0.007221&th&z17 Map) If you want to go from the Putah Creek Park bike path to the I80 tunnel, you have to take a detour along Da Vinci Court, Research Park Drive, and West Chiles Road.

Solution: In theory, the bike path could extend moreorless directly west from Putah Creek Park to the I80 bicycle tunnel.  The problem is that it would have to cut through private property.  Would it be possible to discuss the prospects of a city land purchase or an easement in this area?

Workaround: For the forseeable future, the detour is the workaround.

 Fixed 

 F Street crossing at Davis Art Center 

Problem was: (http://maps.google.com/maps?ll38.560034,121.74486&spn0.000766,0.000996&th&z20 Map) The bicycle/pedestrian crossing on F Street from Little League Ball Park to Community Park (at the Davis Art Center) is not well protected and not fully safe.  The crossing is just south of the intersection of Covell and F.  The crossing might be adequate if it were rarely used, but it is the only route to West Davis that is close to the H Street tunnel and that does not cut through private property.  Many Holmes Junior High students go through here.

Solution applied: (http://cityofdavis.org/pw/CIP/cip.cfm?cipFEAE4A601143EEBDB00C4984C2C251EC City Project CIP8194) The city has long been aware of this problem.  On November 12, 2008, it began relocating the existing F Street crossing 200 feet to the south and (for pedestrians) adding a sidewalk on the west side of F Street.

Workaround: It used to be that you had to be very cautious due to the proximity with the intersection of F and Covell. If you were going north on F street and you wanted to turn left at the Art Center, then it was safer to cross F at the light at 14th Street and take the bike path that began there.

  I would also consider putting squirrels in the hazard category as Ive had multiple instances in which theyve seemingly aimed for my wheels while Im biking.  Luckily Ive been able to dodge them all though, because I would hate to have to pick squirrel head out of my spokes.

20081204 21:21:33 nbsp Sorry, but I disagree: the first instance I looked at (because I needed to gnome the heading) turns out NOT to be a problem. I refer to the crossing of F Street just next to the Davis Art Center. In fact, this crossing was put there to serve both bike network traffic and the Little League fields; it is quite well protected for a bike crossing, with raised bulb outs when you start to cross, and a refuge island in the middle of the street (with a neon green bike crossing sign). Whatever not fully safe is supposed to mean, I dont know. Certainly, if you ban cars from F Street and pedestrians from the crossing, it would be a lot safer. But seriously folks... integrate the crossing with the F and Covell intersection and youre not serving the pedestrians and bikes going to the Little League fields, and youre making crosstown bikers wait for a light instead of crossing when traffic breaks (or isnt there). My 2¢ is leave it alone! Users/DougWalter

20081205 14:52:05 nbsp Hi Doug.  There is a real problem at F Street and the Davis Art Center.  Drivers that have just turned right from the light at Covell have to stop suddenly for the bicyclists crossing there.  It doesnt feel right when children bike there without adult cyclists with them.  Childproofing the bicycle system is a tough standard.  But I made the solution discussion to less dogmatic, to reflect your objection.

  Well, I should have waited to comment, or searched the web, because (as noted) the City has http://cityofdavis.org/pw/CIP/cip.cfm?cipFEAE4A601143EEBDB00C4984C2C251EC started relocating the crossing further south. They also mention that the two left turn lanes from westbound Covell Blvd. help create a hazardous situation at the current crossing. So Ill bow to traffic statistics and a larger data pool than my own observations. Thanks, Greg, for modifying this page and for being concerned! Users/DougWalter

20081230 14:37:50 nbsp Re: Olive and L, why not an at grade crossing, considering it would entail less costs than an underpass tunnel, it might be a better solution. Though there are also general problems with Olive drive, the speeding cars around a relatively blind corner and the often blocked bike paths, not the worst place in Davis, but far from the safest. Users/DavidPoole

  The Tragic Events page suggests to me that an atgrade crossing is a bad idea, and I have also heard that the train company says that an atgrade crossing is unacceptable.  More people have been killed by trains just along the section of track near Olive Drive than have died in bicycle accidents in the entire city.  Not only does Olive Drive need a bicycle tunnel, the train tracks should be fenced off.  Users/GregKuperberg
