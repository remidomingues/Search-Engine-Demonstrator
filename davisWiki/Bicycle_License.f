Both the City of Davis City and the UC Davis University share the same bicycle license program but there are differences in enforcement.  Licenses can be obtained at B&L Bike Shop, TAPS office, and at the Farmers Market on the second Saturday of the month.  Licenses cost $10, last three years, then renewals are $5 (for an extra 3 years).

20090731 20:28:01 nbsp When I tried getting my bike licensed at Freewheeler recently, they said that the forms they had left were for renewals. There was also implication that they may not issue either once the renewal forms are gone, so Id call first before heading over. I went from Kens Bike & Ski Kens to here, then eventually to TAPS before finally getting the license. Users/KevinChin
