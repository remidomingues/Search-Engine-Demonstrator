Davis is the Bicycles bicycle capital of the United States (unless its http://www.bikesparta.com/ Sparta, WI). Here are a few zillion pieces from the news about this.

Note, I stopped editing this page when the Davis Enterprise took their internet archives offline, leaving a bunch of dead links.  I plan to scan in the more interesting articles in the near future.  In the meantime, feel free to add additional articles.  Note that all links but the Enterprise and Daily Democrat are still activetheres lots of good stuff to read! (Ted Buehler, 10 Jan 2008)
