There are many ways to park your Bicycles bicycle around Davis. Some racks have cables already attached that you can use to secure/lock your bike.


Make sure that you attach the lock to something secure, and in a way that doesnt allow the wheel to be removed from the frame  Sheldon Brown recommends attaching a small ulock inside the rear triangle, locking to the rear wheel and to your chosen fixture.  (Theres no need to attach it to the frame, since the rear wheel cannot be pulled out through the rear triangle if locked this way.)

If you leave your bike on Campus campus long enough without moving it, you may come back to find that it has become part of a Bike Sculptures bike sculpture.  And if you leave it even longer than that, you might find that youll have to buy it back at one of the Bike Auction bike auctions.

Some events provide valet bike parking so you can have someone else park your bike for you.

 Campus 
You have to be careful when parking your bike on Campus campus.  If you park it in a spot where there are no designated Bike bike parking areas then its possible youll get a ticket (or get it impounded by TAPS).
 Downtown 


 Wheel Care Note 
Some bike parking racks are designed to secure one wheel without providing any support for the rest of the frame. That type of apparatus puts your wheel at risk of being bent if your bike is subjected to sideways forces.  People who value having straight wheels generally avoid them.

These are found next to the Memorial Union and The Silo.

20070224 01:02:17 nbsp what are the rules on abandoned bikes? Users/JamesHaile
  Just one: make sure its abandoned. Users/TusharRawat
   Done, I think. It had all tires flat, and in bad disrepair and was covered in leaves and crap. Also unlocked with a branch on top of it. Is there a way to validate and verify its abandonedness?
    Technically (I believe) abandoned bikes become the property of the University.  And theyll certainly end up at a TAPS bike auction making money for the U if they really are abandoned.  So just be careful, because taking one could probably still be construed as theft.  But I would be interested to hear other, better informed opinions on this issue.

20080621 13:39:29 nbsp Hey guys!  I work with BikeLid Systems and noticed some commentary on here regarding lack of use at UC Davis.  What could we do to encourage use there?  We would appreciate positive and negative comments.  Thanks! Users/Bikelid
  Ive never used one because the functionality has never appealed. They are located in just a few locations on campus, but take up much more room than traditional bike parking. On a rainy day they arent located near where I could make use of them to protect my bike from the elements. What is the cost benefit to using them from a users perspective (Time, Preparation, etc?)? Users/JasonAller
  Id like to echo Jasons comment and add two other things. Firstly, the lids require a padlock. I dont normally carry one with me as my Ulock works just about everywhere. Secondly, the bikelids are generally dirty and cobwebby.  Users/WilliamLewis
 I agree 100% that we need more bikelids in more logical locations, I think that bikelid or UC Davis should do more to maintain the lids so people are more encouraged to use them.  Oh, btw, my U  lock worked on the bikelids back when I was using them, I wonder why it didnt work for WilliamLewis. KevinP

20080810 13:58:35 nbsp Most of the devices that you can lock your bike to are not designed in such a way that it is easy to use a Ulock to lock your front wheel, bike frame, and the device itself together.  Some devices are completely useless with a Ulock.  Others are certainly useful, but getting your Ulock around both the device and the bike often results in the bike being banged against the device, chipping the paint off the bike frame or fork as a result.

A good locking device should be:
1) Easy and fast to use
2) Provide an easy point to lock a Ulock to, taking into account that bikes and Ulocks are different sizes
3) Shaped in such a way that the bike does not have to rub against the device when locked to it
4) Have parking slots that are spaced so that bikes do not rest upon each other, and so that access to your own Ulock is not difficult Users/IDoNotExist

20080825 13:35:36 nbsp The BikeLid parking spots are often full, so I cant say Ive ever used them. Even so, the idea of keeping my bike safe from being battered by the elements make them appealing. However, it begs the question as to why UCD only allows a few of these bulky, inefficient, and often unavailable spots as the only sheltered bike parking on campus. Why not keep the existing bike racks and just build a simple structure that would cover the whole row of bikes? Users/bingbat

20080917 15:01:18 nbsp I have a ULock, how do i lock up my bike safely to that cement block on the ground? In some areas it seems like that is all there is to park your bike with. I really dont want my bike to get stolen... Users/Natasha
  Id recommend parking your bike in an area with lots of other bikes, preferably in the middle of a big crowd of bikes, and not having a bike that looks brand new and super fancy. Or possibly getting a second chain lock, if youre really worried about it. I used two locks for much of my time on campus, and never had my bike stolen.  Users/ElleWeber
