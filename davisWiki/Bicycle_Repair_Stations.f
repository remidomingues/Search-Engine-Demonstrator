To the joy of many a bicyclist in need, there have been many selfservice bicycle repair stations installed around the UC Davis campus and the City of Davis starting in 2010. The http://www.dero.com/products/fixit/ Dero Fixit stands include wrenches, screwdrivers, tire levers, and tire pumps attached to the stand for DIY bike repair and maintenance. Using these tools, bicyclists can adjust their brakes and derailleur and fix a flat tire.
