 The Davis Bike Loop 

The Davis Bike Loop is a winding path that takes you in a tour around large portions of Davis.

 Historic Davis Bike Tour 
View Davis architectural history from the seat of your bicycle. This tour passes by 26 of Davis landmarks, including Davis Community Church, the DresbachHuntBoyer House, the Boy Scout Cabin, the Train Station Southern Pacific Depot, the Historic City Hall Old Davis City Hall, the Avenue of Trees, and the Davis Subway. For more information, visit: http://cityofdavis.org/bicycles/tour.cfm.

 Winters 
This Winters ride begins at Russell Boulevard and Hwy 113. Heading west (towards the hills), follow the Bike Paths bike path to its end (about 5 miles out). Turn left on County Road 95a, which quickly becomes Stevenson Bridge Road. After crossing the Stevenson Bridge bridge, make a right turn onto Putah Creek Road (youre about 6.5 miles out here).  Follow Putah Creek Road all the way to Winters. You will know youre almost in Winters when the road appears to deadend into another road. At this intersection, youll see an old railroad bridge thats been converted into a pedestrian bridge and an ugly concrete bridge next to it. Just go right over either bridge, and youre in Winters. Take Railroad Avenue for a short stint and turn right on East Main Street. Shortly after a park, East Main Street will deadend into East Grant Avenue (which also doubles as 128). Turn right. Youll climb over I505 on a very narrow bridge with lots of traffic and neither a bike lane nor a shoulder (aka: be careful). After the bridge, East Grant Avenue turns into Russell Boulevard. Youve still a ways to go, but without further navigation, youll be back in Davis! (see http://davisbikeclub.org/ClubDocuments/AreaMaps/DavisDixonWintersVacavilleMap.jpg map)
  One warning about Russell Boulevard after the 505 bridge: Once you go straight  on Russell, as Covell Angles off to the left, Russell Boulevard gets pretty bumpy. Im not sure why, but this stretch of blacktop is broken up regularly like with the joints on a concrete freeway. This leads to a decent sized bump every 1020 feet. Not a terrible ride, but also not the most pleasant either. I dont like it enough to ride it reguarly as a result, and so I havent riden it for more than a year. It may have been worked on and improved in that time. Users/EricKlein

Alternate distances:
  For a more enjoyable ride back to Davis (and an additional four miles), turn left onto Buckeye immediately after the bridge over I505. Stay on Buckeye until it dead ends into County Road 29a. Turn right. After a while, the road will turn towards the north and become County Road 92e. With no other options, the road will resume its eastward progress, changing names once more to County Road 29. This may sound very confusing with the 29s and 92s and all, but you really just have to follow the road. County road 29 is an eastwest road that will eventually be about two miles north of Davis. All the roads between County Road 99 and County Road 102 drop back down to Davis.

 Pedrick Road / Dixon 
Start just south of campus on Old Davis Road (this is the road outside the Mondavi Center). Ride south (away from campus). Eventually, Old Davis Road will deadend at Tremont Road. Turn right here. Follow Tremont until it deadends at the frontage road along Interstate 80 I80, and turn left. Follow the frontage road until it meets the Pedrick overpass. Cross over I80 here. On the other side of the overpass are two gas stations and Pedrick Produce, the latter of which is nice place to stop for a snack. Total milage: 6ish (one way). (see http://davisbikeclub.org/ClubDocuments/AreaMaps/DavisDixonWintersVacavilleMap.jpg map or DavisDixon Bikeway)

An alternate route home:
   Head west on Sievers Road. About 2 miles out, youll come to Stevenson Bridge Road; make a right here. Follow Stevenson Bridge Road north until it hits Russell Boulevard (after youve crossed over a Stevenson Bridge bridge). Turn right on Russell (onto the bike path), and pedal home. This will make the full loop about 20 miles.
   If you take the DavisDixon Bikeway instead of the Pedrick Road route listed above, then crossing 113/I80 and getting to Sievers Road can be tricky. To get on Sievers from downtown Dixon, I took Pedrick Road north from Vaughn Road, and then turned west onto Sievers just after the I80 bridgenone of which felt very safe. Sievers itself is also narrow, with no bike lane or shoulder and infrequent but very speedy traffic. For me, it felt more dangerous than the DavisDixon Bikeway, so do exercise caution. Users/zombiek
   BE CAREFUL ABOUT BIKING NORTH ON PEDRICK ROAD / ROAD 98. Although the quickest way back, this is a hightraffic road without much of a shoulder.
    Some people would say DO NOT BIKE AT ALL on Pedrick Road, saying it is too unsafe. I say its no worse (actually, quite a bit better) than the 128 past Winters, so its just a matter of what youre comfortable with. Ive certainly biked Pedricks a number of times and it isnt all that bad. Do it if you feel comfortable, avoid it if you dont. Users/EricKlein
    Unlike Pedrick Road, there is no safer alternative to 128 past Winters. Agreed, 128 past Winters is just as dangerous (if not more dangerous), but why put yourself at risk when theres a safer alternative? And with the suggested alternate route (above), youll get to ride your bike for about four more miles! For the bikeability of local county roads, check out http://davisbikeclub.org/ClubDocuments/AreaMaps/DavisDixonWintersVacavilleMap.jpg this map. Users/KaiTing Kai

 Lake Berryessa / Cardiac 
To get to Lake Berryessa, follow the directions above to Winters (about 13.5 miles), but instead of turning right and crossing the old bridge into Winters, turn left to stay on Putah Creek Road (you could also go through Winters and go 128 the whole way, but the route here is more scenic, if somewhat longer). Stay right at any intersections you come to. Eventually you will get out to Pleasants Valley Road. Turn right here, and you will soon arrive at the 128 (and a little gas station for snacks and whatnot). Turn left. From here, you will stay on the 128 the whole way. NOTE: The traffic here can kinda suck. Be warned, youve got to look out for yourself on this road. There is no bike lane, and no shoulder most of the way from here on out. I recommend a helmet mirror so you arent surprised when the giant SUV towing the monster warship comes barreling past. Oddly enough, the motorcyclists can also be pretty bad, because the crotchrocket guys like to see how close the can come without actually clipping you. That being said, a lot of the drivers can be quite courteous and will often give you lots of room as they pass. Eventually you will get to a short (but steep, if youre not used to it) climb up to the top of the dam. If it is spring or early summer, I highly recommend stopping at the top of the dam for a look at the giant drain hole. Its an odd sight when its working. NOTE: The steep uphill on your way out makes a steep decline on the way back. This hill is a lot of fun, and you can build up some impressive speed if youre careful. Total milage, about 2223 from Davis. (see http://davisbikeclub.org/ClubDocuments/AreaMaps/DavisDixonWintersVacavilleMap.jpg map)

Alternate distances:
   Keep going beyond the dam. In about 23 miles, youll come to a little store where you can get some snacks, popsicles, or whatever. If you bike from Davis, and turn around here, youve got a nice 50 mile ride.
   If you keep going after that little store, you immediately hit what local cyclists refer to as Cardiac Hill  this is a good name for the hill. It is almost 2 miles long, and is relatively steep (6% grade I believe). If I remember correctly, it gains about 600800 feet overall. Youll feel good once you get to the top though. Also, if you are foolhardy, you can build up some really impressive speed on the way back down. Just be safe about it; dont go faster than you are comfortable with, because a fall at 50 mph would really suck. This hill is also curvier than some others, so high speed isnt as smart here. After the top, you can enjoy a long downhill descent (which youll have to climb again later). Eventually, about 12 miles after the little store, youll come to another little store where you can get some more snacks. If you go straight, youll be on Highway 121, which eventually goes to Napa. (This road has some awesome hills  steep, windy and reminiscent of parts of Oregon.)  If you go right, youll get to other parts of Lake Berryessa, and if you turn back here, youll have done a nice 75 mile ride (with some moderate hills in the mix).



 Cantelow 
(Here is a http://www.gmappedometer.com/?centerX121.91425323486328&centerY38.49121932062687&zl5&flmeh01&polylineetgjFl%7DifVu@x_LrbA_%5DJwIjrB%7CS%60qDfC%3Flb@hsDr@Y%60%7EInk@Hf@xgIdmA%60@xGlLxG%3FRzOxKjZvDt_@hBpY%3FppAjy@%60DtH_Jta@eBX%7EPzPvUYbDlHnJt@lEyO%7Ej@yF%7CD%60@zSyOtA_DwFcVXiBdj@wPvFcSgF%7BDfJ%7CAfM%7CF%7EMzLjKhEQ%7BDrDa@hN%7BHr@%7DAdI%60M%7CAZjDrCjAt@oB%7EKXf@h%5Dik@jVyW%7CEqFbHw%60ApN%7DN%7DAu@rDiElAkh@xC_OeE%7Dc@%7Db@mHQMwQyGgJoEsDt@qlAqKkAmBgFkQgF%7DLfBcCbEiQeBgGas@wFoMyYyNyGm_@iL_QaIoYug@ksCyX%7EIiM%7Ba@%7DC%7DAsRwc@eVhN%7BOqYmVaKeJmPoAaOi%5Eo%7EAwKsOcIieAtHsm@bq@q%5Cyj@u_CiM%7DuAt@%7DzE%7Dc@%7BDa@zHwv@jV%7BCfFmINzDcH%60@wwK map of the ride.) From Davis, head out west on the Russell Boulevard Russell bike path (the bike path will cross Russell twice). When the bike path ends at an odd triangularish intersection, turn left onto County Road 95A. Youll cross Stevenson Bridge, at which time the road changes its name to Stevenson Bridge Road. When this road ends, turn right onto Sievers. After hardly any time at all, turn left onto Schroeder Road. Next, turn right onto Silveyville Road. When this road ends, turn left onto North Meridian Road. Next, take the first right onto Allendale. This will take you under I505. If your water bottles empty, therell be a church on your left where you can stop for some delicious hose water. When Allendale ends, turn left onto Timm Road. Next, turn right onto Peaceful Glen Road. A few rollers later, the road will curve to the left and become English Hills Road. When this road ends, turn right onto Cantelow. Cantelow will present you with some gradual climbs, the accumulation of which gives you an impressive vista looking back towards Davis. Immediately after the vista, youll blow nearly all of your hardearned elevation gains on one quick descent. After the road levels back out again, Cantelow will end, and youll turn right onto Pleasants Valley Road (unless you scoffed at Cantelows climbs, in which case you may want to turn left and do Mix). Next, turn right onto Putah Creek Road. Follow this all the way back to Stevenson Bridge Road, and turn left. You know what to do from here! After all is said and done, your bicycle tires will be about fifty miles worse for the wear.  This is a great route to ride in either direction.  If done without stops, three hours or less is good for bragging rights.

Alternate distances:
  For an additional climb and about three extra miles, turn left onto Cantelow instead of right. Take the first right (Gibson Canyon Road). Next, turn right onto Steiger Hill Road. This will take you back to Cantelow, where youll turn left and continue on with the above ride.

If you start at the railroad bridge in Winters (corner of Putah Creek Road and Railroad Avenue), head south along Winters Road until you reach Allendale, Turn right on Allendale and follow the route listed above, and then stop at the railroad bridge in Winters where you started, you will have traveled 25.5 miles, and your elevation profile will look like this:


 Mix 
Weve all seen the Vaca Mountains to the west of Davis. If youve particularly good eyesight (or binoculars), youll see a collection of antennas near the top of the highest of these mountains. Reputedly one of the steepest paved roads in the continental United States, Mix Canyon Road climbs to these antennas.  The low point is at 358 feet, the summit is 2717 feet for an approximate average grade of 9% for the whole climb. The five mile climb gets progressively steeper, topping out at a 23% grade (between mile markers 4.3 and 4.4) near the top. Some have likened the climb to the famed wiki:WikiPedia:Alpe_D%27Huez Alpe dHuez of the wiki:WikiPedia:Tour_de_France Tour de France (which is twice the distance but only reaches a 14% grade). Mix Canyon Road begins at Pleasants Valley Road just south of Cantelow and a bit north of Vacaville. Much of the climb is half forested along a boulderstrewn stream. The first 3.5 miles is relatively easy (relatively!). Unless youve a wiki:WikiPedia:Polka_dot_jersey red polkadotted jersey somewhere in your closet, you may want to take these miles easy. The first landmark thereafter is known as two houses. After that youll climb to a guardrail and a vista where youll finally see the radio antennas. Once you see these antennas, know that youre almost at the top, so keep going!  As the grade of the road eases off, there is a fork in the road.  The left is gated and the right a graded gravel road, continue right several hundred yards to gain the high point of the road.  From here on a clear day you can see from the Sierra high country to the east, and to the west; Mt. Tam and the north and south towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Believe it or not, this is not a very fun downhill ride.  The road is too steep and twisted to coast for very far without braking.  Stopping at the guard rail for the view and a moment to cool your rims is recommended.  Traffic is scant here, but drivers are usually using the whole width of the road.  The road is seldom wider than twelve feet, is a bit rough in places and the lower miles are often damp.  All of these factors coupled with LSD (thats limited sight distance) make for a very heads up descent.  If you start out from Davis, youll have ridden about 60 miles once you get back. By the way, this is a way, way beyondcategory climb. Weighted bragging rights: one minute ascent time per year of age.  Good Luck!

 San Francisco (east bay route) 
As youre really biking to Vallejo and taking a ferry from there, this is the utilitarian route to San Francisco (unless you count biking to the Amtrak Station). First, follow the directions above to Winters, but instead of turning right and crossing the old bridge into Winters, turn left to stay on Putah Creek Road. Stay right at any intersections you come to. Eventually you will get out to Pleasants Valley Road (past Lake Solano County Park). Turn left here. Youll be on Pleasants Valley Road for quite a while. Theres some traffic, so be aware. Pleasants Valley Road will eventually deadend into Cherry Glen Road. Turn right onto Cherry Glen Road. Turn right onto Lyon Road. (Now youre in Fairfield.) Turn right onto Hillborn. Turn right onto Waterman Boulevard, which becomes Mankas Corner Road. Turn left onto Ledgewood Road. Turn left onto Suisun Valley Road. (When you get to Rockville, theres a cafe thats bikerfriendly if you need a rest.) Suisun Valley Road becomes Pittman Road. Turn right onto Cordelia Road. Turn left onto Lopes Road. Turn right onto Lake Herman Road. (You can see the Mothball Fleet from here.) Turn left onto Columbus Parkway. Turn right onto Georgia Street, which will take you to the http://www.baylinkferry.com Vallejo ferry terminal. The ferry has bike racks at its stern, and youll be deposited at either Pier 39 or The Ferry Building. Total milage: 70ish (one way). If you dont want to bike back, you can take the Amtrak (a bus to Emeryville, then a train to Davis). Theres an Amtrak station near the Ferry Building where you can buy tickets.

 San Francisco (north bay route #1) 
It is possible to descent on San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge. As a disclaimer, this route isnt the best with regards to traffic (121 and 116 are scary). Start out with the Berryessa ride above with the alternate distances. You should be on 128. Head towards Napa on 121. Once you get into Napa, 121 turns into Trancas St (sort of), which turns into Redwood Rd. Turn left onto Browns Valley Rd. Continuing to head south, turn right onto Buhman Ave (you should be headed south). Keep meandering south (the roads dont much matter) until you find 121 again (you dont want to stay on 121 the whole way). Head west on 121 until you find 116. Take 116 towards Petaluma. In Petaluma, you want to find D street and head southwest. D street turns into Point Reyes Petaluma Rd. Just before the Nicasio Reservoir, take Nicasio Valley for about eight miles. Cross Sir Francis Drake, continuing on San Geronimo Valley. Youll eventually get back to Sir Francis Drake, which you want to continue on for a short ways. Take a right on Olema just before the town of Fairfax. From here, the route to the Golden Gate Bridge is pretty well marked for bicycles by signs and markings on the pavement. All you really have to do is follow the other bicycles. Of course, youll still want a map. http://www.krebscycleproducts.com/T1.html This map is excellent. The southbound side of the Golden Gate Bridge has a lane just for bicycles, so you wont have to worry about large masses of tourists taking the same picture with a million cameras. Just north of the bridge, you can also stay at the http://www.norcalhostels.org/marin Marin Headlands Youth Hostel if the city doesnt suit you. This route is just over 100 miles. Take a map so you dont find yourself cursing wiki in the middle of nowhere.

 San Francisco (north bay route #2) 
Although this route weighs in at 150 miles, its by far the safest and most scenic route to San Francisco. The idea is to stay north of all the traffic, making your way through the hills to Rohnert Park/Santa Rosa. However, due to the hills, its not an easy 150 miles. Bike out to Lake Berryessa and stay on 128 for a long, long way.  Youll pass Moskowite Corner, Lake Hennessey, and eventually find the small town of Rutherford. Turn left on CA29. After passing the Mondavi winery, turn right on Oakville Grade. Theres a cafe here thats a good place to gather your breath, as a slew of climbs are about to begin. After a large stack of pancakes (or whatever), youll immediately climb almost 800 feet. After a descent, turn right on Dry Creek, where youll climb about 1200 feet in five miles. Once youre on Trinity, youll descend about five miles. After the descent, cross CA12, turn left on Dunbar, and right on Arnold. Turn right on Warm Springs, left on Bennett Valley, and left on Sonoma Mountain. These three roads skirt around another major climb. (Even if you want to take on the climb, you cant. The involved stretch of Sonoma Mountain is closed. 05/05/2006) Follow Pressley and Roberts, and turn left on Petaluma Hill. Follow this to Petaluma, and find D Street. Check out the north bay route #1 for vague details on how to drop down to San Francisco from here.

 Sacramento 
From A Street, take 3rd Street east, until it hits L Street. Make a right on L Street, and it will eventually curve into 2nd Street. Stay on 2nd. It will eventually cross over Mace Boulevard, and become County Road 32a. Stay on this. Note: About 2000 feet past Mace, there will be no bike path. Continue biking, but be aware of cars coming from behind. The road will eventually cross over the Train Tracks railroad tracks, and keep heading east (with a bike path). It will eventually curve right and loop around under the freeway. Instead of heading under the freeway, get off the road here, and get onto the Bike Paths bike path (which starts just north of the road and has a noticeable gate). Several feet past the gate, there will be a white plus sign painted on the path. Take this path. It will go towards the causeway. Just stay on this path for about 3.75 miles until the causeway ends. It can be a bit noisy in heavy traffic (and a bit windy). Just past the end of the causeway, the bike path splits in two. Follow the path on the left. It will hit and end at West Capitol Avenue, but right across the street is Eppies diner. It is a decent place to grab breakfast or lunch, and the staff has always been friendly when Ive been there. This is now West Sacramento. To get to Sacramento, make a left at West Capitol Avenue and keep heading east for about 3.75 miles. West Capitol Avenue will eventually cross the golden Tower Bridge and become Capitol Mall. This is now Sacramento. The State Capitol can be seen straight ahead, just past the bridge. (see http://davisbikeclub.org/ClubDocuments/AreaMaps/WestSacramentoDavisWoodlandMap.jpg map)

Total Distance to Sacramento from A Street (OneWay): 15.30 miles.

On the other side of Sacramento is the American River Bike Trail.

 Mountain Biking Areas 
Blatantly stolen from the Kens Bike & Ski http://kensbikeski.com/site/page.cfm?PageID120 website  Users/KenNeville kn


 Las Posadas State Forest 
Las Posadas is located 3 miles S.E. of Calistoga in Angwin. This trail system has everything a mountain biker could want. Shady single track through manzanita tunnels, smooth fast descents down the back side fire roads, lazy table tops, rock drops and beautiful views from Inspiration Point. Moderate climbs around the park offer more technical terrain, rock drops, log sections, whoop de doos and other obstacles as well. Lots of cool shade to keep it fun.  Come explore this hidden jewel among the vineyards of the Napa Valley with us. See map.

 Rockville Park 
Rockville Hills Regional Park is Fairfields little mountain bike haven.  Located just out of town to the northwest, Rockville County park offers a variety of great terrain.  A short climb brings you to a valley surrounded by small peaks.  From here, everything you see is fair game.  Rolling fire roads, twisting single track, easytotreacherous descents, rock drops/gardens/jumps, and beautiful oak woodlands surround a lake with strategically placed picnic benches.  So saddle up and lets go ride, were sure youll love it.

 Salmon Falls 
Salmon Falls (take U.S. 50 East to El Dorado Hills Blvd. North; keep right onto Salmon Falls Road and park your vehicle near the bridge at Salmon Falls) has two trails to choose from: The Sweetwater trail is located on the south side of Folsom lake; the first part of this trail is the most technical, followed by smooth fast single track. Lots of shade on this trail keeps you cool. Great trail for all levels of mountain bikers, youre sure to enjoy this fun roller coaster ride through the trees. Salmon Falls trail is located on the North side, across the bridge. This trail starts with a fun winding section with a couple of small rock sections.  After the first half mile, the trail opens up and starts winding through the trees along the lake shore.  One or two short climbs await you, along with a lot of rolling single track and great views.  Both of these rides are outandback, so once you feel you have gone far enough, turn around and enjoy the views from the other direction.

 Foresthill 
Foresthill Divide trail is a great loop ride.  Located off Foresthill Road in Auburn, parking is about 3 miles up on the left, where youll see a meadow and trailhead.  Approximately 11 miles long, the trail winds its way parallel to Foresthill road and consists of shady single track and fire roads on the south side of the road.  There are a few moderate climbs and at least one that will challenge some riders. When the trail ends, follow the road up 200 yards and cross to a recently finished (2yrs or so) mediumwidth single track that rolls back down to the start.  There is a picnic table so you can rest before the downhill half of the ride.  Then sit back and enjoy the trail through the forest, its mellow and fun going back.

 Clementine Loop 
Clementine loop is located just east of Auburn on Hwy 49. This trail starts with a long moderate climb to the top. The descent is fast single track lined with small to medium jumps and rocky sections along the trail. This trail is not for the novice, but after a few rides youll be ready.  The best part of this ride is that it ends at the American River near a swimming hole, so you work hard then relax.

 Pioneer Trail 
Pioneer Trail is located just out of Nevada City along Hwy 20.  You can park at Five Mile House and get a trail map of the area as well as a great sandwich and goodies.  The trail starts right behind the house and parallels the road.  This is a great escape from the Valleys heat, it is just high enough to remain cool and there is tons of shade.  The trail is great for beginners along the first 56 miles, then crosses the road to White Cloud Campground where the intermediate and advanced stuff starts.  Watch for horses on the weekend as this is a multi use trail.

   Does anyone know any good routes to San Jose?

20070703 00:10:59 nbsp Itd be nice if each ride title had a  20 miles or however much after it. Maybe we can start filling these in? Users/ElisaHough

20071203 23:17:51 nbsp has anyone ever tried to bike to the Sac. Airport? It seems relatively close, and approachable by country roads...I called and they said itd be ILLEGAL for me to bike there, and Id be willing to bet they might clip my lock (unless I use my Krypto NY edition, in which case they can try!) but I dont want to go through a lot of hassle... Users/briangoldner
    Yes, my friends and I just rode to SMF today (10/30/2011) taking Pole Line up to Woodland, then right on East Main St. and over the I5 overpass.  That stretch of I5 over the Sacramento River to the next exit (airport) is open to cyclists, according to the Solano Bikelinks map.   One thing you should note is that much of E. Main street is flooded for several months out of the year, during winter.   Users/EfremRensi

  Other than getting from Woodland to the Airport on the I5 bridge over the Sacramento River you shouldnt have any problems. I dont see why it would be illegal to bike there, or park your bike there for that matter. let me know if you try it. Users/PxlAted
  There are no laws against biking there, but that doesnt mean that you wont be http://web.mac.com/stephanorsak/iWeb/Site/Welcome.html harassed, tortured, and arrested (for your own safety!) for it. wl
  I have not ridden my bike TO the airport, but from the building with the rental car counters to Terminal A. It was fine. JoFeuerstein


20080611 12:27:09 nbsp I want to ride out to Lake Solano County Park (http://daviswiki.org/Lake_Solano_County_Park) using the Winters and Lake Berryessa directions from here, but Im wondering if the route is road bike friendly (i.e. is there any dirt?). Anyone have input on this? Users/JenniferCook

 You wont have a problem with your road bike. This is a popular biking loop, especially on nice days.Users/ScottWong

20080718 14:53:40 nbsp hola  Im thinking of living in Woodland  what are the odds of my being able to bike the county road into campus? Im not a very experienced rider, but Im improving quickly. It seems like a long way, but if I get up to 20 mph it should only be like 45 minutes, yes? Users/LaFrance

 Ive only ridden from Woodland to Davis once but on that day I had a headwind the entire way. On a good day 20 mph would be possible but I dont think it would be a feasible cruising speed.Users/ScottMorgan

 Ive ridden that route quite a lot, and you could do it if you were really deadset on it, but in the Spring and Fall youre likely to have some pretty good headwinds (and sometimes crosswinds), and the rainy winter season will not be fun either. I wouldnt expect to maintain a 20mph average unless youre fairly hardcore, and even then, youll probably want a shower when you get to campus (and a change of clothes). 16mph is entirely reasonable if youre on a road bike, or even a good hybrid. Anyway, it can be done, but.... I dont think its good to plan on it. At least look into alternatives for days that you just dont feel like biking, or when the weather is too nasty (I think there is a bus that goes to Woodland IIRC). P.S.: Youll want to take the route east of the 113 since it has nice shoulders. All the routes west of the 113 have no real shoulders, and can get some pretty good traffic. Theyre fun for a weekend ride, but would suck for a daily Ive got to get to school ride. Users/EricKlein

20090325 22:07:51 nbsp There is a http://yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page1636 survey currently running via the Yolo County http://yolocounty.org website that measures demand for an alternate transportation corridor between Davis and Woodland. Users/KevinChin

20120703 13:59:25 nbsp My wife and I are relocating to Davis from Seattle and Ive been doing some research online of the riding locally (both mountain and road). One day while using google maps and the bicycling layer to show bike routes I noticed that just outside of Winters on Quail Canyon Rd there is a trail shown heading up into the Putah Creek Wildlife area. Using the satellite function it shows a fire road (or some dirt road of some sort) heading up into that area with many more roads beyond (not shown as trails on the map but can be seen on the satellite view). So on our recent house hunting trip down there we drove out to Quail Canyon rd to take a look and there was a nasty sign saying something about: Warning! Private Property! Only property owners and their invited guests permitted beyond this point blah blah blah... This sign was on Quail Canyon rd almost as soon as you turn off of Pleasants Valley rd and we didnt go any farther to actually check out the dirt road shown on googlemaps as a trail. So my question is, it appears someone put that trail/road into googlemaps so I assume people are riding it? Does anyone know the story on this? Thanks for any info and I am excited to explore all of the great biking in our new home. Users/JJasonGraff

20121130 10:26:00 nbsp A guy who I went to high school with wrecked badly on Cantelow last weekend, suffering a burst fracture of T10 vertebrata, 14 broken ribs and a fracture to a vertebrata in his neck. He also lost feeling from the hips down. A woman rider discovered him, called 911 and comforted him until help arrived. If you or someone you know might be that person, please let the riders wife know. The family would like to thank her. The riders wifes Facebook contact info is http://davis.patch.com/articles/cyclistbadlyinjuredoncantelowroadlookingforwomanwhohelpedcalled911 in this story of his accident. Or you can ping me on the wiki. Probably a long shot, but thanks! Users/justincox22

20140712 07:24:11 nbsp Did the Davis to Lake Berryessa and Woodland to Lake Berryessa routes several times each in the 1960s; wonderful rides at the time with little traffic, but a lot fewer people.  Good advice her on the steep hills.  I got to the bottom of the long run on the other side of the dam, having passed a couple of cars, only to discover two very low tires.  A bit scary, as I had gone down on loose gravel in Woodland only a couple of weeks earlier.  But, a beautiful ride, even more challenging in the heat of summer. Users/MichaelCrutcher
