As popular as bicycles are in Davis, a certain number of them are going to be constantly breaking down.  Davis and the local region has many Bicycle Shops, both for profit and nonprofit, that will get you back up and bicycling as soon as possible.  Heck, some people even Bike Church get religious about fixing bikes.
