When pumping up at gas stations, you typically face a 5075 cent fee.  California law states that air is free for cars purchasing gas, which is irrelevant in a bicycles case, but you can often just go inside and ask them to turn on the air without being questioned. You might not want to go this route, however, because gas station air compressors will often blow bike tires up.

Many Bicycle Repair Stations have pumps, as well as tools for making repairs.

 Pump Locations 


Note: pictures of the hardertofind locations would be helpful ...

Most of the pumps listed below are for tires with Schrader valves (the type youd see on car tires). If you have a higher end bike, youll probably have Presta valves on your tires, which wont work with these pumps! There is hope, however. Most bike shops carry Schrader to Presta adaptors for about $1.

 How to fill up your tire 
The first thing youll need to know is what type of valve you have on your bike.  Most valves are either wiki:Wikipedia:Schrader_valve Schrader (common on mountain bikes and cruisers) or wiki:Wikipedia:Presta_valve Presta (common on road bikes).  Most pumps around town are for Schrader valves (which are also used for cars), so you may need to purchase a PrestatoSchrader adapter (about $5 or less at any bike shop) to use these pumps around town.

Next youll need to see how much pressure your tire can take.  For some pumps you can just inflate your tire until it stops inflating, but beware  there are many pumps that will pop your tube if you overinflate (especially at places like gas stations)!  Your tire will likely have a maximum amount of pressure it can take written on the side of the tire.  Look at that figure and inflate no more than that point.  Its usually around 40 psi for mountain bikes, 80 psi for hybrids, and 120 psi for road bikes  but make sure you check yourself.  If you have a mountain bike or hybrid, youll probably want to run the pressure at or close to the max rating when on pavement. If youre going off road, run the pressure a bit lower for more shock absorption.

Bike tires can lose up to 10 psi per week, whether youre riding or not, so regularly checking your tires is a good idea.

20070812 00:54:41 nbsp Does anyone know who maintains the public pumps (e.g., the Oakshade one)? Ive gone there and its been out of air, and the people in the nearby businesses dont know whom to contact. Users/KevinChin

20080921 15:41:18 nbsp Which of these have pressure gauges on them? The picture of the Oakshade one shows that it clearly does not. Users/RobertM525
  Very few of them, if any.  Ive never even seen one with a gauge on them.  Your best bet is to buy a cheap gauge from any of the bike stores around town, or better yet, buy your own hand pump with a built in gauge. Users/AlexanderHo
   You gotta learn to do it by feel, use the force. Users/GarrettGallegos

20100902 14:30:30 nbsp Yesterday (9/1/10) both the Regan Main and TAPS pumps were out of order. Users/GJC02
