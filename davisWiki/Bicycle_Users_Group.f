The Bicycle Users Group (BUG) was a campus Bicycling Advocacy bicycle advocacy group made up of students, faculty, and community members founded in 2006. This page was created at that time. The group had plans to become an official UC Davis student organization, but ceased to be active as interest waned over the following year. During the same time, Davis Bicycles! was established. The information below dates from shortly after BUG was founded.

Their mission is to promote the use of bicycles/increase bike ridership, make bicycling on campus as safe as possible, and to encourage positive change in UCD policy with regards to bicycling. BUG also vows to do all it can to keep Davis http://www.bicyclefriendlycommunity.org/AllBicycleFriendlyCommunities.htm #1 in bicycling.

Here are five easy things you can do to support bike advocacy, adapted from http://www.planetbike.com Planet Bike.

 1. Replace one car trip per week with a selfpropelled Bicycle Rides bicycle trip.
 1. Bicycle Tire Pumps Put air in your tires and lubricate your chain. A smooth running bicycle is safer and more fun.
 1. Join your local, regional, or state bicycle advocacy organization and Volunteer Opportunities volunteer whenever possible (hint!)
 1. Ask your boss to adopt some bikefriendly policies at your place of work (e.g. a bike rack and providing a shower).
 1. Make your vote count by considering bicycle transportation and urban planning issues when you choose your political representation. Those people work for you, you are the boss!
