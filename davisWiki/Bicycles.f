In a town where bicycles (colloquially, bikes) are more prolific than Demographics people (see the Bicycle Census), you will encounter a population of bicycles as diverse as their owners. There have been many Bicycle News Articles articles written about the relationship that Davis has with its bicycles. Owing partially to Davis Davis isnt flat almostflat topography and an extensive network of Bike Paths bike paths, Bicycling bicycling is a CarFree in Davis primary mode of Transportation transportation for many. If you have a bike, make sure to Bicycling Tips lock it in a Bicycle Parking designated area. If you havent a bike (and need one), there are a plethora of Bicycle Shops bike shops to suit your needs, wants and Living Cheaply budget. There are also many pleasant Bicycle Rides bike rides awaiting you and your bike.

Beware of shopping for a bicycle at department stores. Department store bikes are cheap toys intended for children. If you use a bike as your primary mode of transportation, youll put more wear on the department store bike than it was designed for in a short period of time. Theyre built from the cheapest parts and are frequently assembled incorrectly. The brakes are frequently dangerously ineffective, especially in rain. Parts may rattle and fall off. If you do decide to go the department store route, you will end up spending more on repairs and new bikes than if you just got a nice new or used bike to begin with. Youll also have a nicer ride if you go with the nicer bike.


 Road Bikes 
Fixed Gear  This successor to the pennyfarthing bicycle has no freewheel and only one gear ratio. This means that you cant coast or shift. Since its possible to slow the bike by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, fixed gear bikes (also called Fixed Gear Bicycles fixies) often have no brakes or just a front brake. Theyre most often ridden on wiki:WikiPedia:Velodrome velodromes (see Track bike below) and in large cities such as San Francisco and New York. However, Davis flat topography is ideal for fixed gear bicycles. With the help of a local Bicycle Shops bike shop, you can easily convert your old road bike into a fixie. Not all fixies are track bikes. Generally, the old road bike conversion isnt considered a track bike. Fixed gear bikes have obtained cult status amongst http://www.digave.com/videos/ bike messengers. Theyre popular among many for their ability to wiki:wikipedia:Track stand with relative ease.  See http://davisfixed.com.

Racer  Often made of carbon fiber, titanium or aluminum, these bicycles usually cost thousands of dollars and weigh less than most students backpacks during finals week. If youre streaking through campus on one of these bikes, chances are that the bike cops wont be able to catch you. Also, these bikes should never be left out in the open on campus or elsewhere. If you must, take them into your office, class or lab. Often used more for exercise than transportation, your racer will be happy on one of these Bicycle Rides rides or participating in one of these Bicycling Advocacy events.

Anchor(Recumbents)Recumbent  These are bikes that are ridden in a seated position with your legs out in front of you to a greater or lesser extent. The back support and full seat (somewhat like a hightech lawn chair) make these bikes very comfortable and a good choice for longdistance commuters, heavier cyclists, and those with back problems. Its a bit like riding a Comfy Chairs comfy chair.  Recumbents arent any more difficult to ride than a traditional bike once you get the hang of it. Due to aerodynamics, theyre typically faster than traditional bikes on flat ground. Many recumbents are trikes, generally with two wheels in front and one in back (tadpole configuration). The land speed record is set by a recumbent at 81.1mph. Due to many nonstandard parts, recumbent bicycles are typically more expensive than regular ones.

Retro  A few decades ago, this bike was a young, fast, streaking racer. But with the relentless advancement of technology, these bikes became handmedowns or were sidelined in garages. However, theyre ideal candidates for getting you around Campus campus and town! While most Freshmen freshmen  buy a shiny new bike at some Target big box store, the old road bike will be more reliable throughout your college years. Also, these bikes are faster and have more style than a hot pink Magna. These Living Cheaply affordable bikes can be bought at used Bicycle Shops bike shops and garage sales for less than $100. Theyre also ideal candidates for conversion to fixed gear.

Single speed  A close relative of the fixed gear, the singlespeed bicycle has only one gear ratio but has a freewheel so the rider can coast.  Fixed gear and single speed bikes have the advantage of being extremely low maintenance, since there are fewer moving parts to worry about.  To spot a fixie or singlespeed around Davis, just look for a road bike thats missing its d√©railleur.

Tandem  A bike for two. They are quite popular in Davis, especially with families and couples. Tandem recumbents can even be spotted. However, dont ride a tandem by yourself. Thats just sad. You can rent a tandem bicycle from Kens Bike & Ski Kens Bike & Ski for $20 for 4 hours, or $39 a day.

Time Trial  In the same vein as the racer, but geared towards aerodynamics at the expense of comfort. They are usually used in bicycle races in which the rider races alone against the clock. If youve a time trial bike, put it to use by racing the wiki:WikiPedia:Putah_Creek_Time_Trial Putah Creek Time Trial every other Wednesday during the summer. This 10 mile time trial is a great way to practice your individual timetrialing skills. Wheelworks stocks time trial bikes. APEX Cycles stocks frames and will build a TT bike to your preference and budget.

Touring  These bikes are designed to go long distances carrying loads of gear. See wiki:wikipedia:Bicycle touring. They often come in recumbent or tandem configurations. They are much like racers, except that they have a more relaxed geometry and generally have beefier wheels (more durable rims, more spokes). They have brazeon mounts for racks and usually have cantilever brakes to allow for larger tires and fenders. If you like the feel of a road bike but want something a bit more comfortable and durable, these might be exactly what youre looking for.

Track bike  A fixed gear designed for use in wiki:WikiPedia:Velodrome velodromes (the nearest being http://www.ridethetrack.com Hellyer Park). These never have brakes and often have wiki:wikipedia:Bike_tires#Tubular_or_sewup_rims tubular tires running at insanely high pressures up to 200 psi. These bikes have the bare minimum needed to ride; you wont find water bottle cage, fender, or rack mounts on these babies. This makes them a poor choice for long distance rides, but are a good way to get around town if you lower the pressure in the wheels to something reasonable to smooth out the ride.

Triathlon  These bikes are pretty much the same as time trial bikes, but geared towards the cycling leg of a Triathlons triathlon. If youve a triathlon bike, put it to use by joining the Mad Cows Racing Team or UC Davis Triathlon Team. Wheelworks stocks triathlon bikes. APEX Cycles stocks frames and will build a TRI bike to your preference and budget.

 Mountain Bikes 

Downhill  These bikes are designed so that adrenaline junkies can fly down mountains at insane speeds with confidence. They are durable, strong, have plenty of suspension (front and back) and can take on anything that gets in their way. Those who ride them can be classified as crazy and usually wear full body armor and fullface helmets to counter the potentially huge wipeouts. These bikes are perfect for trips to Northstar Ski Resort, Downieville and many other great trails that Northern California has to offer.

29er  The 29er is newest incarnation of the mountain bike.   The 29er is basically a mountain bike with 700c wheels instead of 26 wheels. The thought is that the bigger wheels are more efficient and roll over obstacles better than their smaller wheeled brothers. A 29er makes a great town bike especially if you throw on some narrower tires like some 700x28, now you have a very solid town bike that can take more than a bump or two and is capable of hanging pretty well with your road bike friends.

Imposter  The imposter mountain bike is typically purchased from a Target big box store and, although it looks like a mountain bike, its really not. These bikes sometimes come with full suspension, but this is deemed unnecessary as the bike is too heavy to ever get airborne. Although cheap, these imposter mountain bikes quickly start making a huge racket. As they age, parts seem to shake, rattle and fall off. Its better to buy an old nonbig box store bike (one bought from an actual bike shop) than a new big box store bike that started out as a piece of crap.

Retro  Like the retro road bike, this was once an expensive mountain bike. Although age has made the bike unattractive to thieves, it still rolls well. Given Davis topography, you may want to replace your knobby tires with a set of street tires. Mountain bikes are often more comfortable than road bikes since you ride in a more upright position. Also, they can easily carry Freshman Stripe fenders and racks for your groceries.

Serious  Unlike the socalled mountain bikes that can be bought at Target big box stores, the serious mountain bike is actually capable of taking on mountains. More common on Campus campus than its road equivalent (the racer), these bikes usually have front suspension making them ideal and comfortable for handling all types of terrain. Just like the racer these bikes must be locked up with care and/or taken indoors whenever possible.

Trials  These have fat tires, low gearing, and are built to jump on tables, platforms, off ledges, across gaps, and a number of other stunts one would not have thought possible on a bike. Trials bikes are rarely seen without their riders, as their low gearing makes it difficult to actually go long distances.

 Other Bikes 

BMX (Bicycle Motocross)  Characterized by 20 wheels, these bikes are small and maneuverable, ideal for racing on hilly tracks as well as performing jumps, spins, and other tricks. BMX originated in California. Lower quality BMX bikes have too many pegs, are brightly colored, and are sold at Target big box stores. Higher quality BMX bikes are much plainer looking and usually very beat up from lots of healthy abuse.

Cop Bikes  Used by Davis Police Department, they are black heavy duty road bikes.  They have LED red/blue emergency lights, siren, and a black pack mounted over the rear wheel.

Cruiser  Heavy but reliable, cruisers are another great option for Davis level terrain. Usually singlespeed, they sport a comfortable seat and upright riding position. Often, cruisers come with fenders.

Cyclocross  These bikes are designed for races that go between pavement and rough offroad courses. These bikes generally are like racer road bikes, except with sturdier frames, lower gearing, cantilever brakes and knobby tires. if you think a road bike is too delicate for you but you want to ride fast on the road then a cyclocross bike may be an option for you. These heavy duty road bikes can use the same tires as most modern road bikes making them great everyday road bikes.

Ghetto  These bikes have been reincarnated by frankensteining together odd parts from old bikes. Check out the Davis Bike Collective for resources on how to assemble your very own. Luckily for you, thieves wont deign to touch your bike.

Hybrid  These bikes are some combination of a road bike and a mountain bike. Theyre designed for road use and light unpaved trail use and are mainly aimed at commuter cyclists. They typically have the lower gearing and straight handlebars of mountain bikes and thinner slick tires like road bikes. They may or may not have suspension. The exact balance between road and mountain varies from manufacturer to manufacture and model to model. Theyre a good choice for Davis, but you might want to swap the tires out for skinnier ones if you have knobbies or wider tires and you want a bit more speed and dont care for nonpaved trails.

Bike Church/Yellow Bike Yellow Bicycle  These strange bicycles are painted completely yellow and have City of Davis markings all over.  The one in this picture was not locked.  These are part of a fledgling wiki:WikiPedia:Community_bicycle_program community bicycle program.


 Other HPVs 


Unicycles  While having one too few wheels to be a bicycle, the Unicycling unicycle is a good way to rebel against the bicycle culture of the Peoples Republic of Davis. Unicycles can also go anywhere, as there are seldom any No Unicycling signs.

Tricycles  Obviously not a bicycle either and not just for toddlers! Road trikes are easy, comfortable, stable to ride, and an excellent option for those with balance problems or disabilities. Others use them for their performance or simply for fun. Road trikes are generally recumbent, with either two wheels in front and one in back (tadpole) or one wheel in front and two in back (delta). Trikes are great for commuting and long distance riding. Davisites also use more traditional upright trikes, often for hauling cargo.

 Comments 

Users/StevenDaubert sez that his dad bought a brand new rode bike as his means of conveyance from North Davis to Campus, and promptly spray painted it black and declared that it was no longer asthetically pleasing and now sticks out less for thieves. You got to remember the two types of bike theft, opportunity hey I need a ride across town once, I will take this bike and ditch it and straight out deviousness ie My GF wants a new bike so me and my buddies are hitting up campus with bolt cutters \

Users/GavinElliott is a web visitor from Australia. His town of Noosa is also cycle friendly.
