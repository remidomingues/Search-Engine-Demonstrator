What is the definition of a highway?Users/JimSchwab
   Good question. I read on the http://www.csaa.com/global/articledetail/0,1398,1004040000%257C1196,00.html AAA website which cites the same code street or highway but the California vehicle codes clearly say highway.  Users/ArlenAbraham
   The definition:  A main public road, especially one connecting towns and cities. GEL
     Is that a legal definition in the Davis codes?

Interesting that there is no definition of the legal limit...I assume this means anything 0.01 and above?Users/JoePomidor
  Browse the whole chapter of that law and youll likely find the legal definition for the limit. Users/JasonAller
