Big C is one of the Aggie songs.

 Big C 

{{{We are sons of California,
Fighting for the Gold and Blue,
Palms of glory we will win
For Alma Mater true.

Sac States men will soon be routed
By our dazzling C,
Well stomp em in the mud,
Their green will turn to blood,
In our hour of victory!

Grrrrah!  Hey Hey!
Grrrrah!  Hey Hey!
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrah!

Blood, drip, drip, drip,
Blood, drip, drip, drip,
Blood, drip! Blood, drip!
BLOOD!}}}


I thought Big C was a UC Berkeley song? In high school, our rivals used it. Unless its a shared song. But Big C also has these grrrs in it, like a bear? Some current band kid correct me if Im wrong.  Users/MichelleAccurso
  This version of Big C is ours, we play it all the time!  Cals version has different lyrics (they dont rout Sac State for example). And there are grrs in it, its fixed now.  Users/AllisonEriksen  or the whole blood thing....eek.  Users/rocksanddirt
   Super, thanks! My high school used the grrs in our fight song, i love them!  Users/MichelleAccurso
 A legal case settled a copyright dispute issue between the songs use at Berkeley and UCLA.  The court decided that both schools could use the original tune, but that each schools rendition was copyright to the respective school.  Since then, other campuses have been free to make renditions of the song by legal precedent.  Cal (Berkeley) used to play a 6/8 version of Big C.  The current version at Cal is a cut time rendition in E flat.  Anybody know about the version/arrangement that Davis plays?
  Our version is 6/8 time in B flat and was arranged by L. Austin, no year given. Users/AllisonEriksen
  On a stylistic note...the various arrangements have a substantially different sound.  the 6/8 version is very traditional march sounding, the version UCLA does sounds very show tunish (think big movie production number), and the 2 version Cal uses is very raw (think some one slapping you from one cheek to the next).
