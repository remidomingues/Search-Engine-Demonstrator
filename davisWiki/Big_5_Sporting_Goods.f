Big 5 Sporting Goods is a large chain store that sells low to mediumend equipment for a wide variety of sports. Big 5 also sells firearms. It is one of the best places in Davis to get fishing gear. They dont have any socks above size 13.  Airsoft ammunition can be found here as can paintball gear, but keep in mind that you can find it far cheaper online.  Big 5 always has items on sale, the sale items rotate every other week.


20090413 18:26:13 nbsp pretty good stuff ok prices but a lot of times you cannot find a worker to ask where something is Users/Churro615

Sometimes there are only one of two of us working and spend time running to the front and back stockroom to get people things. We try to stay out on the floor but that doesnt always happen. Just ask the cashier or be patient and as always we appreciate your business. Users/patrick82

  I purchase a new pair of combat boots here about once a year.  Theyre cheap, durrable and most important in the winter months: Water proof. users/masonmurray MM

20110216 07:35:08 nbsp I bought a machete here for brush clearing at home. It was a cheap piece of dangerous crap. Basically, it was so unusable and dangerous it had to have been a costume or novelty machete. It was made of a metal so cheap and ductile that I could permanently bend the blade into an L shape by applying moderate pressure with my pinky. I noticed the blade was all messed up when it was bent in a U shape from the first few swings out of the box, hitting some light, green ivy growth. Of course, it went sideways on me, and could have really hurt me. I returned it, and told them they were selling a dangerously cheap product, and of course, they didnt give a damn. I wrote this review after discovering, over a year later, they still sell the same product. I come here expecting to be sold garbage, so if I have any other alternative at all, I go elsewhere.

20120701 01:04:02 nbsp Ive bought a few guns from here, its not the best selection but the staff are pretty friendly and competent given that this is not purely a firearms store.  Users/JasonMill
