Big Lots is a warehouse full of various items that are closeout merchandise at closeout prices.  Basically, they buy overstock, discontinued items and other things that have fallen out of normal retail and sell them cheap.  They say they are 70% cheaper than most retail, and 20%40% cheaper than discount places like Target.  They have a Buzz Club which is essentially a system for notification by email of deals that it offers for those who sign up notifications of new inventory.

The Woodland store sells furniture (not all Big Lots stores do:  see the web site for store locator information and whether it offers home furnishings).

Their slogan is Brand Names! Closeout Prices!

To get to the West Sacramento Big Lots, take Yolobus 42B and get off at Jefferson Blvd. (the last West Sacramento stop). The bus stops in front of a Walgreens store. Cross the street to get to Big Lots (its in the wiki:westsac:Safeway Shopping Center).
