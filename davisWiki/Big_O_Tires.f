The name of this place tends to make Computer Science students chuckle. wiki:WikiPedia:Big_O_notation hint  nbsp Hmm... makes me chuckle too, but for a http://www.amazon.com/BigOOrgasmsHaveComing/dp/0767907485 different reason Users/CovertProfessor

20051216 09:42:47 nbsp They use to have really nice customer service but last time (and final time) I went, they refused to rotate my tires unless I purchased a whole new set. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060724 08:44:00 nbsp Generally an OK place to go if youve got the time to wait.  Suspect its because of name recognition.  Too bad there isnt anything to do close by while your waiting.  Small lot so they generally discourage leaving the car there. Users/UsetheForce
  There is a small nursery next door if youre into plants... Users/AlexPomeranz

20060922 16:49:15 nbsp Big O really sucks.  I brought in a flat tire after work to see if they could repair it and went back 24 hours later, and they hadnt even looked at the thing. Users/GradyHamilton

20060924 14:22:09 nbsp Actually you can take a short walk to 7Eleven to get a Slurpee. Users/JoeyBennett

20061113 13:49:15 nbsp I think their customer service is great.  I never have to wait more than an hour (Slurpee time!) for them to finish up.  When a used tire I had bought there got a flat they fixed it for free no problem, no hassle.  I reccomend it! Users/ElisaMaassen

20070205 17:14:47 nbsp One of my front tires was losing air through a wheel weight, so I took it to Big O. They fixed the problem for free because they had installed new rear tires on my car a few months back. Not a bad deal. Users/NerdUp

20070502 19:35:23 nbsp I have been to Big O for so much stuff because I got my tires there and you get free rotations and stuff after you purchase from them. Every single time I have gone in the past year (4 times)something is wrong after they work on it. It is so frustrating. If I were you, ask them to TEST DRIVE your car before you pick it up. They do not double check and something always goes wrong after they work on it. They are nice but they really need to figure out what the heck they are doing.  Users/lisah

20071107 14:08:44 nbsp Called today to check prices on tire rotation and balancing.  Big O will rotate and balance all four tires for $40. Users/MattVanGundy

20071203 05:33:52 nbsp This shop has got to be the worst tire shop I have ever been to. I tried to mount a set of tires at my shop, but I could not do it because of the tire compound. I took it to Big O because they have much more experience in this area, but the worst attitude of any shop I have ever been to. I was charged nearly 30% more than I have been before for mounting the same set of tires on the same set of wheels. Why? because Big O does not care if you have been there multiple (4+) times and contributed to their success in Davis. I was quoted a price on the phone, which was a different price that I was quoted when I got there, which was a different price than what they thought they should have charged me. I spoke with the manager and he would not even walk up to me. He simply stood in the doorway telling me there was nothing he could do about the price and to not bring my wheels back to the store. They also would not take my coupon that I got off their website. The unprofessional attitude is a HUGE thumbs down in my book. I will never go to this Big O or any Big O for any of my tire mounting. If I had not been a college student, I am sure he would have treated me differently, but that is my own observation and opinion. WILL NOT GO BACK, EVER.  Users/AlexKang

20080706 03:01:50 nbsp I called around and Big O had some of the best tire prices around and they were really good about dealing with my half dozen phone calls. I worked with John and was really happy. I will be going there again SOON to get tires for my better halfs car. Users/SeanMartir

20081015 16:42:12 nbsp I don not recommend this place. THEY ARE LAZY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE IF YOURE FEMALE. I had a popped my back tire and needed a replacement. So I purchased 2 replacement tires, thinking they would go in the front (like other tire shops do) and have the front tires moved to the rear. They failed to do that and when I went in asking why, they failed to explain and just said thats normal procedure. Anyway, I was running late to class so I didnt argue. Point is: I highly recommend to go elsewhere.  Users/beabeck22

20081031 19:30:11 nbsp Reasons Not to go to Big (N)O

1. Their prices are more inflated than their tires. Seriously; I had to return as soon as I drove off the lot after a service  my tire was low.
2. Its a new crew than from previous years. These new ones treat me like I am stupid and incompetent. Im a lawyer.
3. Plan on making a return trip soon after your service. That sticker on your windshield may as well read: 10 miles to next service. They work is not always perfect.
4. Unless your child is familiar with crude conversations and cussing, dont make the same mistake I did. The workers can be heard from the wait area.

I recently came in on a hectic day at Big O knowing that I was due for some new tires. When you purchase Big O Tires, as I have done in the past, they come with the free rotation, and such, to keep the excellent warranty valid. Though I was not perfect, I did come in consistently. I was told the previous time that the next time I would need new tires. I came in prepared. I had a Costco price and was confident my local Big O would match it to earn my local business. I also had a quote given to me a year ago, about the time I was told I would need new tires next rotation. I skipped some. (Its an old car; give me a break.) When I came in about 5 weeks ago, it was a new crew. I was greeted by the manager, I cant remember if his name was Don or Jon, and I told him my situation. He looked at my tires and agreed. He was very friendly at this point. I was glad to have gotten Teds (the owner) right hand man. I gave him my information which he entered on to a computer. That was new. Then, after typing a lot, he told me it would be $650 and change. It was much higher than the other quotes. I tried to haggle and he became seemingly angry. He spoke very assertively, it was a little aggressive. I mentioned Costco and it seemed to frustrate him. I also said the price was much different a year ago. He explained tires have become much more expensive. When haggling did not work, I simply asked for cheaper tires. He said that was all he had in stock today. I was almost glad, I was so dissatisfied with the service. I left and he said, Have a good day. I called back the same day. This time I got a different guy. Over the phone I was quoted Avid Touring tires from Yokohama at 89.99 a tire, for a total. Asked if it could be installed today, I was told yes. Needless to say, I said Have a nice day. Hung up. And went to Goodyear. Ending an 8 year relationship. It hurt. But it became abusive. I had to leave. Hah. Anyway, thats my experience and advice. Users/CLymrik

20090627 16:48:19 nbsp Ultra shady place! DO NOT GO! Ive bought tires from twice and both times I had to replace the tires I got from them after only two weeks. The tires were of poor quality. Never going back there again. I recommend you avoid this place. Users/techguy201

20090717 17:16:32 nbsp Never go to Big O Tires in Davis.  Took my Tahoe in for alignment and get a phone call  you need new tires.  Yeah, I know, I5 told them  Im selling this car and I decided to sell it as is.  They tell me it is dangerous to drive it like that and did not do my alignment.  I go to pick up my truck and they put my damn spare on and charged me $25 for that.  My own damn spare!! Any monkey can do that in 10 minutes and it takes 2 hours for me to make 25 bucks after taxes.  My tire was not dangerous as they said when I checked it out so I had to pull my spare off and put my wheel back on so I can sell my truck  as is  needing tires (My choice, big o!!)  Screw Big O they were just trying to come up on my hard earned dollars. Damn monkeys!! Users/nterider

20090818 13:24:47 nbsp I went there today for a wheel alignment on a nine year old truck.  It has never had an alignment done.  I was quoted a very low price.  The gentleman told me it was not uncommon for nine year old trucks to need some of the wearing parts changed out when doing a front end alignment. I agreed and prepared for bad news.  They got right to the job and aligned the wheels.  (It should be noted I also asked them to do some other minor adjustments on nonwheel related equipment.)

When the job was finished, the manager advised me they noticed some slight wear to those components, but none needed to be replaced.  I was charged exactly what they estimated.  Furthermore, they took care of the other things I asked them to do and did not charge me a penny for the additional services.

I made it a point to speak with the manager.  I told him I appreciated that they didnt run the bill up on me.  I told him I was fully expecting them to say I needed to replace this or that, and, because I dont know anything about front end alignments, I was prepared to break out the check book.

Too often you find auto service shops to be rip off joints.  When I find one that easily could have, but didnt rip me off, Im happy to tell them I appreicate it.

Theyve earned my business.  Ill be back again soon. Users/Soldier

20091102 20:37:41 nbsp These guys are great. The owner helped me and saw to it that some problems I had had with tires in the best wouldnt be an issue this time around. He also had the the warehouse delivery person turn around en route to pick up my tires so I had sameday service. Id go back here in a second and recommend this place for straightforward and trustworthy service.  Users/RMG

20091116 20:23:42 nbsp I had a pretty good experience at Big O I did some shopping around and I couldnt believe everyone (including Big O) was asking about $80 out the door to replace a single tire. I told everyone they were crazy for asking so much and no one said anything different until I called Big O. I went to Big O because they were the only ones who presented other options (ie used tires, different size tires If I could afford to replace all four ect ...) Users/KMEvans

20091205 20:08:54 nbsp Ive now had two bad experiences with Big O. In the first, my CV boots were failing and they recommended a repair. I thought I agreed to replacing the CV boots, but my regular mechanic later pointed out that they had installed CV boot covers instead. Later, I came in to replace 2 tires (I thought the other 2 had life left). They seemed adamant that all 4 needed replacing, then also suggested additional work. I had my car at my regular mechanic just the day before, and he said the things suggested were unneeded. Overall, I feel theyre trying to get me to agree to work I dont need. If you buy tires from them, dont agree to additional work they suggest. Users/GingerGee

20100428 09:06:36 nbsp Took my car in today to get a tire patched. Was done in 30 minutes and cost $20. They also rotated my tires for me. When an employee saw me get my laptop out during the wait, he quickly told me that they have wifi and gave me the password. Overall, a good experience. Users/KeithBradnam

Today we got to see the real definition of excellent customer service.
My wifes car began to make an odd squealing sound.
We took it to Big O Tires in Davis, California where Dave and the staff quickly found the problem.
It turns out there was a small leaf stuck in the brake assembly which caused a sound that was similar
to the noise that takes places when the brake pads are low.  In stead of taking us for a ride,
they very quickly and honorably fixed the issue and charged us NOT A RED CENT!
You can bet that we will take the vehicle in for service there in the future!
Our thanks to Dave and the crew at Big O Tires in Davis, California! Users/Scot

20110101 20:26:17 nbsp These guys helped me out with a flat the other day. They were very fast and I highly recommend them. Users/twblalock

20110112 10:01:50 nbsp I had a full set of tires replaced a few days ago. They were extremely quick and impressive  from the initial presentation of quotes for 3 different options to the actual work on my car. There is a waiting area with wireless though I had barely logged in before my car was done. Prices seemed very competitive too. Users/Mazzle

20110218 10:44:14 nbsp The place felt like a 60s repair shop. Bunch of immature workers, specially playing with an air pump to his crotch. Not worth it IMO. Take your business elsewhere.   Users/ncJice

20110309 03:17:11 nbsp I have had good luck here, prices were clear and up front, service was done quickly and fairly. From what I could see the workers were professional and knew what they were doing. They even gave me a free ride back to an ATM while I was waiting! Users/IanBurau

20110630 08:26:12 nbsp I purchased a set of 4 tires in February, 2010. At that time, Big O said I had 2 bad tierod ends, and that I would have to get them replaced before they would do my alignment. I had both tierod ends replaced (albeit, not by them!!), and when I took my free alignment card in, they still refused to align them. I put exactly 10,000 miles on those tires, had them rotated, and then last week I noticed that the cords were showing on the drivers side front tire. I was livid~! I took my car back to Big O where they proceeded to tell me that because I bought my tires on the buy three get one free deal,that meant that I never had a warranty on my tires! The manager of the store proceeded to tell me that he would go ahead and align my car, and I thereby proceeded to ask him if he was admitting that he was wrong in the first place. I then asked him what type of discount he would give me on 2 new tires and he said he would take $10 off each tire. I said, Goodbye Mark, and walked away. He then said, Get back here. I was trying to deal with you. I laughed, turned around and said, You Sir, have no idea who you are dealing with. You will also be turned into the BBB, the local newspaper and TV stations will be called. He said, Yeah, whatever. Get the hell out of here. I am in the process of doing everything in my power to inform everyone that Big O is nothing but a scam and a rip off. By the way, I ended up going to WalMart to get new tires, which were of a higher quality, and I do indeed have a warranty. If Big O hadnt given me a warranty, one would think they would have put it in writing on my paperwork...right??? Users/StefanieSmith
  Theres still something wrong with your car.  Tires may fail by letting loose a chunk of tread or having the cord separate, but they dont fail by wearing through the cord in 10k miles.  Get your car to a mechanic before you wear out the new set.  And BTW, Im not fond of Big O and dont trade there so its not a case of me shilling for Big O.  I have, however busted tires for awhile in a previous life... Users/JimStewart

20110701 08:23:51 nbsp DEAR STEFANIESMITH, MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS THE SATISFACTION OF MY CUSTOMERS.  UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION IN YOUR POSTING FOR ME TO RESEARCH YOUR HISTORY.  I DO NOT HAVE A RECORD OF A CUSTOMER NAMED STEPHANIE SMITH AND I DO NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYEE NAMED MARK.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR YOU.  PLEASE CALL THE STORE AND ASK FOR MYSELF, WILL OR DAVE AND WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY AND RESOLVE ANY ISSUES.  THANK YOU.  TED CHAMBERS, OWNER.  (530) 7537900.
 Users/TEDCHAMBERS

20110725 11:33:41 nbsp PLEASE AVOID!!!!! All I needed was a simple tire repair today for a nail in the middle of my right rear tire. Average repair cost is 1025 dollars and 25 exact at the dealership for my car. These guys charged me 40 by telling me that added cost was for the sensor in my tires. Never in my life have I paid that much for a simple patch job. I knew it was overpriced but I had no choice because I was already late for work. Users/hychung

20110813 09:38:48 nbsp I went in today because I had a crack in my tire. I spoke with Dave who was very friendly and knowledgeable. He was really honest and upfront with me and did not try to push his products. I would absolutely go to them in the future for tire related problems  Users/DanielleC

20111028 16:19:02 nbsp Run away avoid big o liers! In this tire shop nothin is what we tell you. Alignments that r within specs employees r told to move the targets.to make the car owener beleave that there car needs to be align when the alignment is alredy good employees do this for the comition they receave for the alignments oil changes r done with the same oil for every car the same oil gos in to a hibred as a diesel  Users/Johnnyshortsac

20111226 10:33:29 nbsp I didnt want to go to Big O because of the negative comments I read on the Wiki, but Goodyear was closed so I went anyway because I needed a new tire. They we so nice and helpful there. The guy took the time to explain the tires to me and when I asked if there were any other options because I couldnt afford the new tire I needed he went in the back and found a used tire in descent shaped and sold it to me for a very reasonable price. They had the new tire installed and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I was so surprised and delighted, this is the way customer service should be!!! Users/pootersmith

20121002 15:20:47 nbsp They told me it would take 2030 min to change my oil. The store was almost empty but no body was at the counter.
The phones where ringing and I was waiting to be helped. Besides the lack of people up front to assist you, I ended up waiting two hours for an oil change because they opted to flirt with the girls that were here instead of getting work done in a timely manner. Users/CodyTapley

20130205 18:20:33 nbsp used to work for this place would not recomend anyone purchase tires from here. ted will rip you off in a heart beat and doesnt care for anything but his money. i have seen so many wrong doings in this place its ridiculous. from lieing on alignment print outs by moving the heads to putting the wrong oil filters on and not putting proper oil in vehicles. selling things that dont need to be sold and using the cheapest parts he can find. this place needs a serious inspection by bar and to be shut down.. anytime there is a problem ted will run away (because he is a coward) and make his employees deal with the issues. just seriously stay away from this shop terrible work is done there and you will often be lied to. purchase your tires in woodland Users/johnwashington

20131228 17:43:32 nbsp The Big O in Woodland is consistently at least 20% cheaper on everything. I would highly suggest going there instead.  Users/MasonMurray
