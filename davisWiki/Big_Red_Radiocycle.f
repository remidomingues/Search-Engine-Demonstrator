If you see some goateed madman riding through town on this, screaming at cars while blaring KDVS, thats probably Users/MattJurach.

Features of the Big Red Radiocycle:
  Six gear speeds for those Davis Bike Overpasses hills
  AM/FM radio
  Three baskets for a fivegrocerybag carrying capacity
  Drink holder
  Fenders for avoiding the Freshman Stripe
  Three bike light attachments for night visibility goodness
  Authentic bike bell good for surprising unaware pedestrians

The Big Red Radiocycle was purchased after I experienced my third bike theft from campus, and I wanted a bike so heavy that no one would be able to make off with it. Many herniated wouldbe thieves later, Big Red is still here cranking out the tunes and the dings!

Matt sold the bike. It is still heavy and ready for action, but no radio. Big Red helped its new owner Jed compete in a Bike Challenge. Jed came in 3rd place!
