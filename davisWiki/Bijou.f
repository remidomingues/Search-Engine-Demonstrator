 Personality 
I am most assuredly a cat, but I have yet to meet a cat who does all the uncatlike things I do...I enjoy a good game of fetch(yes, I bring my toy back to whom ever is playing with me), go on walks, ask for water (by mewing) when sitting in a sink or tub, sit and situp on command(if I know a treat is coming), and go on various adventures with Megan (i.e. to farmers market or to class at UCD).
