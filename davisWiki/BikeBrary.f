The Davis Bikebrary (Bicycle Library) is now open for your service!

 What is the BikeBrary? 
The BikeBrary is a bicycle and trailer lending library for use by the UC Davis and Davis communities.  The BikeBrary was created because it seemed like a lot of people could use trailers for their bikes, but few had them.  This way, anybody can cheaply use a trailer for the specific task they need it for.  And we decided to throw in a couple bikes, too.   This has evolved into a bike lending program and hopefully will include short term trailer lending in future as well.

 What you get 
This information is out of date I believe

We currently have many bikes and a few trailers.  Members may check out up to one bike and one trailer at a time, for up to four hours.  To check out bikes and trailers take a look at the http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?srcdavis.bikebrary%40gmail.com BikeBrary Calendar to see if somebody already has it reserved, and then email us at MailTo(davis DOT bikebrary AT gmail DOT com) to make your reservation.


 Cost 
The BikeBrary is meant to be very low cost, however we do need funds for maintainence and replacement.  For that reason, the BikeBrary asks for a resonable rental donation and usually a $25~35 deposit on the bike to ensue it is well treated and returned.

 How to sign up 
To sign up please head over to the bike church while a minister is present.  Ask a minister how to get involved.  The minister will cet some form of contact information and write down the details of the exchange in the log book.


 How to checkout and checkin 
This information is no longer up to date!!
We will send you a confirmation email after you are a member and make a reservation request. The email will contain TWO numbers.  The first one is the combination number for the cable lock that is currently locking the bike/trailer.  the second number is the combination that you will change it to (its easy.  When you meet with a minister of the bike church, they will show you how). Keep this number! You will need it to lock and unlock the bike/trailer!

You will get the checkout for up to four hours.  However, the BikeBrary is only open for checkouts and checkins from the hours of 10:00am to 6:00 pm. If your time extends to past the closing time, come check in the next morning at 10:00, there will be no penalty.
