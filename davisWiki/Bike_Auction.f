Twice a year, usually midOctober and early May, TAPS auctions off abandoned Bicycles bicycles found on Campus campus. They sell hundreds of bikes which are usually in some state of disrepair. However, for the brave souls willing to put a little bit of money into fixing up a bike, the Bike Auction is a great place to start. The cheapest bikes can be found towards the latter half of the auction, when the caffeine begins to wear off and the bidders are less excitable. Prices tend to range from $20 to $80. Newcomers complain that prices are too high, as they expect real bargains.

The trouble with auctions is that the buyers pay too much and the sellers get too little. Anonymous

The viewing period is heavily congested time with a lot of people in a small space. It is best to either show up early or towards the end to avoid the line. Bidders must signin initially to get a bid card. The signin table is near the auction area. It takes roughly one hour to auction off 100 bikes. Towards the end, most people are gone and this is the best value for the bidder. On top of that, TAPS does not seem to arrange the bikes in any order, so a decent bike can be #1 or #400. It is also a good idea to get a seat early. Waiting till the end of the viewing period will guarantee you standing room if you are lucky and the auctioneer only looks toward the front for bid cards.

Most bikes are mountain bikes and maybe some commuter bikes. There are only a handful of road bikes. Sometimes, there are some highend brands like Giant or Peugeot but dont expect to get a deal. Most bidders are uninformed and tend to bid more than the real value for these bikes. They only see the brand and not anything else.

The first bicycle auctions occurred when Emil Mrak was Chancellor.  He set aside the profits for the Cal Aggie Camp, but that grant was revoked some 30 years later.  Currently, the money probably goes to Cliff Contreras pockets.

The auction is held in the West Entry Parking Structure, UC Davis. Take Interstate 80 towards Davis. Exit Hwy. 113 North. Exit Hutchison Drive, UC Davis. Follow Bike Auction signs to parking and auction site.

Description of the Spring 2006 auction:

The auctioning started at precisely 9:09 am after an initial viewing period from 8:009:00 am. Bikes (or in some cases, bike frames) started at a base price of either $5 or $10, and went up (or down, if nobody bid) from there. The lowest price any bike sold for was $1. The highest price paid was about $190. Most bikes were in need of serious repair, but a select few (the $190) were in excellent condition. A toddlers bike was sold, as well as a vintage recumbent. A BMX bike sold for $10. Most bikes purchased from the auction had decent frames, rusted gears, chains and brakes, and often had select parts missing.

Notable (or frequent) bidders:
 #9  an older Chinese woman and (I assume) her husband, who purchased several Roadmaster mountain bikes at an average price of $5 each.
 #11  middleaged African American man, who apparently had hauled away a truckload of bikes from a previous TAPS auction.
 #72  young man with sunglasses, bought two bikes at $1 each, among others.
 #120  person of unknown age, wore orange beanie ... jokingly requested bike prices lowered to $2.50 when no one bid. Frequently bought bikes missing tires and seats. Most frequent bidder and winner, bought many bikes and frames at $10 or less each.

 TAPS Ebay Auctions 

According to the bike auction website, TAPS also sells some bikes via Ebay.  Their ebay URL is http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZucdbike
If you win one of these auctions, you only have to come pick the bike up (no delivery).


20050811 01:12:21 nbsp The times I attended I got the impression the good bikes had been siphoned off, as every single bike was a fixer upper. Users/SteveDavison
  It does seem a bit suspicious that the decent bikes you see around campus with the TAPS notes on them never seem to make their way to the auctions...  TAPS does hold ebay auctions as well though, so maybe the decent bikes are sold that way.

20050908 14:32:54 nbsp Do they also sell components, or just whole bikes?  I need some shifters and a chainring and Im too Living Cheaply cheap to buy new. Users/CarlMcCabe
   If youre loose about the definition of bike, they sell only whole bikes.  Check the Bike Church?
    Now the Davis Bike Collective  Users/DarinWick

20060430 11:02:46 nbsp I went to this event for the first time yesterday and I thought this was a great event. I got an older single speed bike with a basket and in good condition for $50, and my boyfriend got a 10 speed mountain bike for $35. After inflating the tires and cleaning the chains theyre both like brand new bikes. Deffinatly a good thing to go to if you want a decent bike that works well but doesnt look too hot and wont tempt the theives on campus.  Users/SydneySwartz

20070509 13:35:34 nbsp I went once, but it seemed like I sat through a bunch of crap being sold off, without any real ability to try stuff out, before bikes got sold for way too much.  I ended up buying a bike in pretty good shape for $20.00 off Craigslist. Users/DanLawyer

20070509 15:11:05 nbsp Its a mix of quality and prices. Some bikes are sold for $40+, but others are much cheaper. I bought a bike for $8 and another for $3. The $3 turned out to be better than the $8 one. It just needs the seat height adjusted and the breaks tightened. Really, for the price, theyre not so bad. Users/TaniaG

20070509 15:49:32 nbsp Interesting. Its actually on campus now. Makes it more of an incentive to go and easier to get your purchases back to your dorm. But it really isnt worth it unless you come with a bit of luck. TusharRawat

20080427 00:19:32 nbsp I remember these from when I was a child, good times Users/StevenDaubert

20080505 01:21:01 nbsp This year the auction hit the halfway point between 11 and 11:35.  Users/RichardYeh

20080505 14:26:50 nbsp Im so bummed I missed it.  My housemate got all excited yesterday and showed me the paper saying it was this coming Saturday.  Unfortunately, he was showing me last Fridays paper...I laughed at him, then we both cried... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091013 10:53:53 nbsp The 2009 auction was somewhat of a mixed bag. As a first timer, I was outbid on the good bikes as the older people there had quite a bit more than what I was willing to spend and thus, I lost several good bikes. But what of the bikes? As you guys have already noted, dont come here expecting a brand new Bianchi  most of these were rusty POS bigbox department bikes missing a piece here or there. And it was these bikes that quickly hit the high prices! Some went above and beyond the $100 mark.

What of me? I accidentally bought a $15 Magna without front brakes and a chain that snapped. Oh well, I guess the course of action will be: 1. Buy bike. 2.Visit Bike Collective for awesome parts. 3.??????? 4. Profit! (and probably donation)

Anyways, my advice to you is to maybe not go unless you really know your stuff. If youre the person who knows that the bike (points) over there is a Giant Rincon with blahblahblah hubs and blahblahblah shifters from 10 away, this is going to be good for you. You wont be paying $100 for a Target bike or getting outbid on a pristine Jamis bike by a man in a ridiculous hat (yes , Im still bitter!) :D Users/HarrisonM

20100501 12:46:30 nbsp Just came out of the May 2010 auction, which ran through about 430 bikes and 3 bone piles in 3.5 hours. The highest bid of the day was $470 for a Cannondale R800 CAAD5 650C road bike missing only a rear wheel. Second highest bid landed around $170. Everything else mainly sold below $100. Some even sold below $5.00! Probably 90% of the bikes were department store stuff, but hey, it was fun to watch. Great place to get parts for a project bike. Users/Wavy
 Yeah, I remember the guy who won the Cannondale. It was sorta scary how firm his hand stood as the auctioneer weeded out everyone else. Users/kiddmit3

20110427 12:42:06 nbsp In Response to SteveDavison, the better bikes you see on campus that are tagged usually have the tags taken off of them, before we pick them up.  When we do happen to pick them up, the owners can usually be reached more easily since the bike is probably licensed or the owner is more willing to take the bike back or is looking for the bike.  However this year (2011) we have a little bit better selection of bikes because TAPS is able to sell the crappier bikes on ebay rather than wasting time selling them at the auction.
