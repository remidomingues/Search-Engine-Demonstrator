The ASUCD Address(Bike Barn, 38.538646393576, 121.752222573718)  sells and rents Bicycles bikes and cycling equipment, operates a repair shop (making about 10,000 bike repairs annually), and loans tools to customers free of charge. They also have a schrader air pump available for public use outside the door during hours of operation (and more inside) if your tubes need a bit of a boost.  For those with presta valves, they sell schrader to presta adapters inside for $1.


The Bike Barn offers a Tool CheckOut area where you can get tools to fix your bicycles bike if you have a valid UCDavis ID (student, faculty, employee etc) and are feeling mechanically inclined. However, they do not check out tools at the Bike Barn location.  You must go to the Bike Garage (also located on campus).  Alternatively you can turn your bike into the Bike Barn staff, and they will fix it for you. They will give you an estimate, and will tell you when to come pick up your bike, and you pay when you pick it up. They also sell various items youll need for you and your bike like fenders (so you wont get the Freshman Stripe), lights, funny bike baskets, helmets, gloves, and just about anything else you can think of. And to make things even better, you can charge purchases made there to your Reg Card (see info below).

As of September 2009, The Bike Barns Tool CheckOut area has moved to the Bike Garage, which is located in the parking structure closest to the MU. It is located on the first level, and can be accessed by entering the structure through the pedestrian entrance and making a left turn. Its hours are 114 MF.

They sell several makes and models of new bikes like http://www.sunbicycles.com/sun/index.htm Sun Cruisers, http://www.somafab.com/index.html Soma, and http://www.breezerbikes.com/index.cfm?CFID11242626&CFTOKEN61482495 Breezer, all of which come with a one month warranty. In addition to new bikes, the Bike Barn also sells used bikes, freshly tunedup and ready to ride away at a decent price. The number of used bikes ready to sell varies during the year depending on how busy the shop is. The Bike Barn has a large rental fleet consisting of 250 cruisers (more information below) that are available for rental all year round. The tool checkout area has all the tools you would ever need to fix your bike, plus stands, oil, rags, and helpful employee advice. The shop sells just about every accessory and can special order highend parts not in stock.

The Bike Barn does have used bikes on hand at any given time, but does not specifically specialize in the USED market.  Used bikes are usually from the previous rental fleet brands they are authorized to sell along with Specialized, Trek, Cannondale, Cervelo, Colonago, BMC, Schwinn, Fuji, Raleigh, Bianchi, Giant, Gary Fisher, KHS, K2, Jamis, Klein, Scott, Santacruz, Intense, Electra and other classic/vintage brands once sold new in other shops locally.

Careful though, as with buying anything used, they are not authorized dealers for some of these brands, they can not help you with any future warranty issues, other than what they provide in the shop.

 History 
The Bike Barn was founded in 1971. Besides the general manager, it is completely student run and selfsupporting. They offer classes through the Experimental College on bike maintenance/repair and wheel building. The shop is located in renovated barn that dates back to the first half of the 20th century; this it shares with Outdoor Adventures, another great campus resource. The barn of the Bike Barn was built sometime between 1919 and 1923 to house the Stock Judging Pavillion.

The Bike Barn has seen significant improvements since 2000 under the direction of Robert St. Cyr. A bill passed by the ASUCD Senate Senate on May 5, 2005 gave the Bike Barn several upgrades such as another cash register to reduce waittime and the ability to accept Reg Card reg cards (though the system is not in place yet). They also remodeled during the summer of 2005, which gave them nice new siding inside the building and a sparkly yellow floor.

The Bike Barn donated parts and labor to KDVS for the 2005 KDVS fundraiser fundraiser: the KDVS soundsystem bike is a vintage, powderblue schwinn frame, apehanger handle bars, chrome bullet light, stereo, baskets, new wheels, new brakes, new 5speed shiftsystem.  The Bike Barn kicks ass.

In 2007 the Bike Barn was voted Best Bike Shop in the California Aggie Aggies California Aggie/Best of Davis 07 Best of Davis Poll.

The Bike Barn has one of the largest bike rental fleets on the west coast with over 250 bicycles!

20051013 16:41:36 nbsp In my experience, any form of ID will do (for checking out tools). Users/ArlenAbraham

20060126 16:25:44 nbsp I brought my road bike in for a tuneup last Friday morning.  The woman I interacted with did a good job explaining my options, and she was more concerned about price than I was  this definitely inspired confidence.  I left my mobile phone # and email address on the service request, and asked that they contact me when the bike was done.  No, she said, I should just come back at 3PM on Tuesday.  I was skeptical, but she insisted.  So, I came back on Tuesday at 3PM (while on call  not the best time to be away from Campus Data Center my desk), and not only was the work unfinished but they werent even sure which bike was mine.  They offered to let me rent a bike for cheap or free, but I wouldve much preferred a phone call or email telling me that they were running behind.  I came back today (Thursday) to pick it up  this time the work was complete and they knew which bike was mine.  Bottom line:  Im still peeved that they wasted my time even after I specifically asked to be contacted, but they did good work and they did it within the quoted price range. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060723 02:00:30 nbsp I have never had a problem there with workmanship but their customer service needs work. The major problem I have had is when ringing the bell at the front counter, sometimes no one comes up front for a long time. The last time I was there, I rang the bell while the manager was talking on a cordless pone in the front. He told me someone would be right up to help me, then he went to the back. I watched the clock and rang the bell ocassionally. When ten minutes had passed and still no one had responded, I left and I have never been back there since. It wasnt the first time something like that had happened, and I dont want to subject myself to it again. Users/MiguelGarza

20061002 16:55:23 nbsp I took our Motobecanes there a couple weeks ago. The service was great! The staff was very helpful and throughly explained all my options for the best value for the money I was to spend (which ended up being quite a bit but it was worth it). They even helped me load the bikes in my truck when they were done. Thanks Bike Barn! Users/MyaBrn

20061012 13:05:35 nbsp They dont rent road or mountain bikes anymore :( Users/KarthikRam

20061027 13:31:45 nbsp TIP You should NOT go to bikebarn to fix your bike on FRIDAY since they are closed on Sat and Sun so you will get your bike LATE Monday. Find other local bikeshop if you want to ride your bike for the Weekend. Users/ChickenNuggets

20070128 12:02:23 nbsp The bike barn is a nice place, if you have a bit of a bang up and you need your bike fixed on campus etc. it has that nice convenience thing going for it. Most of their problems stem from the fact that the employees are less regular than those at other shops, that they are all students and hence have schedules fit around their classes and the like, hence the person you give your bike to is not necessarily the person doing the work, and then there is the third person who is giving you your bike back, and thus there is a bit of communications difficulty for finding a bike  and perhaps getting the work done, but they seem to have good estimates, they probably do not want to call people for time issues, that is the one thing that I suppose does need a bit of work, on the bright side, picking up your bike on the way to class is pretty swell. Users/DavidPoole ~Dave

20070508 08:54:47 nbsp do they cut locks? Users/AcaciaMora
 No, but TAPS will if your bike is registered.  Users/WilliamLewis
 Or if you tell them your friend moved out of town and left the bike for you. Users/ElisaHough

They do cut locks if you can prove that the bike belongs to you and you can bring it to them.  Otherwise you should use taps.

20070508 11:59:39 nbsp They sold my friend a tube and tires and then let me check out some tools to put it on, even offered some pointers. Users/StevenDaubert

20071025 01:15:44 nbsp I took my bike there, since the tube was pretty much dead.  I dont think that a tube change takes a lot of time, but I took it Monday, and the expected time of return would be on Thursday.  I feel that that is a bit long for just a tube change.  Im sure that they may have had a long todo list with other bikes, but something minor like that shouldnt have taken four days to complete.  Users/BreeButler

  It really doesnt. When one of my tubes popped for the first time, I spent a few hours learning how to change it (popped the first replacement tube). This was all at the Bike Barn after they told me it would take them a week to fix it (and cost twenty bucks in addition to the cost of the tube). Next time I needed a tube replaced, I went to Kens Bike and Ski. They basically replaced the tube within the hour (they usually can do this during the week, but are busy weekends so it might take a day) and it cost thirteen dollars (which was how much the tube cost at the Bike Barn). Six dollars for the tube and six dollars for the service. Fortunately, ASUCD fees doesnt go to the Bike Barn. Users/hankim

20080129 02:28:11 nbsp They dont loan out tools any longer, but they will let you use tools if you bring your bike to the shop. I just asked about this today. Users/twblalock

20080220 09:59:38 nbsp It doesnt take four days to swap a tube. Bree, if you brought it to the Bike Church we do it in about ten minutes for three dollars (wholesale for tube) $3 is not wholesale for a tube  Newmatic. But then we sometimes get excited and teach you to true your wheels and adjust your brakes. Sorry.

I had a friend bring her bike to the Bike Barn personnel at Focus the Nation, and they botched a brake adjustment with the pad up against the tire. Before that, my roommate dropped off a flat tire at the Barn and spent $28 dollars, with his bike impounded for several days. Users/Darach

20080417 09:26:47 nbsp WOW IF YOU SHOW UP WITH AN ENERGY DRINK FOR THE MECHANIC THEY WILL DO SOO MUCH MORE FOR YOU ON THE SPOT Users/steveguyman

20080417 09:54:19 nbsp Hey, so as you may or may not know the Bike Barn works off of a first come first served repair basis, so while a flat change does take only about 10 minutes, we have to complete repairs in the order they are received. When we have well over 30 flats per day and nearly as many more complicated repairs, we dont have time to take care of new repairs right away. We strive to complete every repair in a timely fashion, without compromising the quality of our service. Occasionally, this means we need more time than was quoted if we feel the bike needs more attention than was initially estimated. When this happens, we try to be as accommodating as possible, and any kind of feedback, positive or negative, helps us to further improve our shop. Users/BikeBarn

  I think if you get thirty flats a day, you are missing out on a wonderful business opportunity by not hiring someone to specifically replace tubes all day long. It is ten minutes of work for an experienced bike handler and that probably means the handler would definitely be worth his or her pay. Users/hankim

20080425 10:58:04 nbsp i went in this morning because my rear derailleur was skipping gears and my rear brake needed to be adjusted. they were really friendly and adjusted both for me on the spot free of charge. much obliged for getting me back on the road so quickly. Users/sinnott

20080623 16:23:22 nbsp Horrible service, over priced.  Guy was evasive and rude.  Use Kens bikeandski. Users/EngyAndy

  Thats what usually happens when you have a group of people that provide a good or a service, but they have no motivation to compete for your business. Users/hankim

20080829 13:01:15 nbsp The bike barn now stocks many fixie parts and complete custom fixie builds.  You get to choose the frame, which hand built wheelset you want, and all the color and part combinations.  Its a very cool way to get an original custom bike at a cheap price. Users/bikedavis

Apex Cycles has more fixie stuff and at better prices... better service too.

20080924 23:50:39 nbsp Check out the Bike Church! The Bike Barn is great, too, of course. But if you want free recycled parts, or even a whole bike for $20 go to the Bike Church over by the Domes. Users/maxstevenson

20080925 13:04:25 nbsp Abercrombie model employees, check. However, in trying to get a basket I had to void the transaction three times because I kept getting a one that did not work for my bike! Partly my fault, but my bike was right there in the shop, so I think they could have given me some pointers. Do not go in there right as school is starting because they are very busy. I like the tool check out idea, and free air. Users/KarenWhitestone

20081017 18:48:28 nbsp These guys are a bunch of douchebags. Note: to actually get service here, you must either be a girl or talking to a girl worker. Users/polites

20081028 15:03:27 nbsp These guys FCKING SUCK!! I bought an inner tube and told them I needed my popped tire replaced quickly. I bought it from the bike barn btw for $7 (which is totally overpriced). They said theyd get it done by thursday if I drop it off immediately (monday morning). The guy at the counter offered a rush service where my bike would be ready by the end of the day. Normal labor costs are $7 for inner tube changes at the bike barn, but rush service is $14. I said yes and he said come back at 4pm. So I went about my day bikeless, being late to my classes. I walk from across campus back to the bike barn after class and its 4pm. The door was locked so I knocked and the guy inside said they are closed for the day and the register is closed and to come back tomorrow!! WTF!? What the FCK DID I PAY RUSH SERVICE FOR IF THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE ME BACK MY BIKE WHEN I DONT NEED IT? AFTER THAT ON THE NEXT DAY, THEY HAD THE BALLS TO ASK ME TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR RUSH SERVICE!! I paid $14 bucks for a 5 minute inner tube change which wasnt even done on time. These guys are a Fcking disgrace. They seem like they are just a big scam and are around to rape peoples wallets (particularly new students, so watch out). everything is overpriced. service is extremely shitty. very unprofessional people. I can understand them being swamped with work, and their mechanics seem like they are good, but CUSTOMERS SHOULD FCKING GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR. Im never going back there. All they are good for now is free air, which they will probably start charging for in the future anyway. This is my 2nd bad experience with the bike barn. Id recommend a local bike shop downtown. much cheaper. much better service. I take my bike in there now and they change tires and tubes in your face and in under 5 min for WAY LESS than the bike barn. The bike barn should really be up for review. TWO THUMBS WAY WAY WAY DOWN. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of these dumbsses. Users/NickAG

     Im sorry to hear that this customer had such an unfortunate experience, but if you get to a store after hours and they are closed you cant expect to get your bike at the time you requested. Im sure the guys working at the bike barn completed the rush service order, which explains why they would charge for a rush service order. It doesnt matter that the customer wasnt able to get there on time  sorry, but that was his fault.
   As opposed to this customers experience, Ive gone to the bike barn several times and have always been happy with both their customer service and the prices I was charged. They were thorough, explained exactly what I needed and what I would be charged for their service, and even saved me some money. I would give them two thumbs way up. :) Ill continue to go here and will recommend that others go here as well.

20081029 21:09:24 nbsp Ive had nothing but good experiences dealing with Bike Barn this fall. NickAG if you are so upset about a tire change, you should really learn how to do it yourself it is a great life skill to learn and will save you time and money at any shop. Users/wpriff

20081113 21:59:26 nbsp Do not go here. they are totally overpriced! Users/Cody

20090608 12:05:59 nbsp Ive had varying experiences at the bike barn. The experience you get out of it depends on the employee you get and the level of experience you have with bicycles.  They prey on the ignorant here.  If you come in and show them that you dont know the first thing about bicycle repair they will tell you everything on your bike is worn and that you need to replace it, and they will give you an estimate of how badly they are going to rape you for your money.

Dont buy any equipment here if you have a choice.  Everything is at least double its retail value.  There are bike shops around down town that will give you a better price (Stay away from Ace Hardware, also overpriced).

If you are a fixityourself kind of person you will have a MUCH better experience at the Bike Barn.  They will lend you their tools, and if you have questions they are happy to answer them.  I once got a bit over my head replacing the bottom bracket, the spanner they provided me with didnt provide enough leverage to remove the cups on the bottom bracket(and had a tendency to slip, causing my hand to punch into the bike and come away with less skin than it previously had), so one of the employees came out with a handy dandy really expensive tool designed solely for the purpose of removing bottom bracket cups and a 5 foot aluminum pipe for leverage and cranked it right off.
Technically they are not supposed to help you like this, but they appreciate teaching people how to help themselves  it reduces their work load.

Also, if there are other people waiting or tinkering with their bikes, dont be afraid to ask them for help (I dont mind helping people patch/replace innertubes, tighten chains, remove chain links or do any of the small things that plague the employees).   Users/TrippKATZ

20090713 21:35:33 nbsp Got a bike there today, both Alicia and another gentleman (I only remember her because her name was embroidered on her apron), were very nice and helpful with my service. Saw the bike I wanted online, they had it a bit cheaper, so not that overpriced as others have stated. Not to mention even if it was a bit more expensive, its helping out fellow students. Users/patrick82

20090713 21:43:29 nbsp Now Im not sure, but her name did start with an A either way. Users/patrick82

20100316 17:57:45 nbsp I had a flat on campus today and found out that the Bike Barn takes their air hose in when they are closed.  Users/hankim

20100924 16:53:09 nbsp Brought in my bike with a flat tire today and was told that they were backed up, so it would take 710 days, with a ticket estimate of $18+. I couldnt wait that long, so I took it to Kens Bike & Ski, where it took 15 minutes and cost $15 (and they tightened my brakes, handlebars, and kickstand free). The Bike Barn guys were really nice and friendly, and its not their fault they have so many ticketsbut if you dont have time to wait, you do have other good options in the community. Users/zombiek

20101118 10:06:55 nbsp The bike barn has the worst customer service of any bike shop Ive found in Davis. My experience today has brought me to leave a comment. This morning I got a flat on campus and swapped out the inner tube with a spare I carry in my bag. Rather than crack a fresh CO2 canister in my emergency pump I went over to the Bike barn and asked if I could borrow a presta valve pump. The gentleman there said they have none to use and then I asked if I could put a deposit down on a prestaschrader adapter so I could utilize their compressor outside. He said no, that is not their policy, and directed me to their new repair facility half way across campus.  What sort of bike shop does not offer these services? According to their policy, I could have purchased a new wheel set, with tires and tubes, and would be sent away to pump them up. Today I thought I would give the barn a second chance however I have been reaffirmed to never bother with the place, no matter how drastic the situation.  Users/Edward
     Edward, we are sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your experience at the Bike Barn. We have tried providing presta pumps in our shop for customers multiple times, but customers always end up breaking them within a few days. Even with creative signage and   explanation on how to use them, they always end up broken. We decided to start selling the presta adapters to offset this problem, allowing customers to use any pump on campus or in town. And that is correct we do not take deposits on any item we sell. In terms of the location of the Bike Garage, it is the only location available for us to use and it also a free service to students that the Bike Barn provides outofpocket. If you have any more questions or issues feel free to contact us.
        Out of pocket? If the Bike Barn stops paying for itself the students are going to end up paying for it through ASUCD fees anyway. Who knows, student fees might already be going to the Bike Barn. Users/hankim
               Hankim, the Bike Barn is a breakeven unit and usually ends up making money for ASUCD to be spent on other units and organizations. We are not subsidized by student fees.
            There are other programs that the ASUCD supposedly does not pay for, but it is unclear whether the building space and utilities are paid for by fees or not.I know that the Bike Barn is not specifically mentioned in the budget, but am unsure about the building or utilities. Users/hankim

20110503 17:17:55 nbsp Yesterday I saw a female student tell an employee that her rear brake was loose and could he adjust it? Instead of just adjusting the barrel adjuster on the lever, he avoided pointing out the adjuster and simply gave her an estimate ($25?) to replace the cable. I cant believe he was so clueless not to know, and he didnt even try to adjust the cable! This is outrageous! Total rip off! This is not the kind of service student expect from an organization supported by student fees! Id be glad to provide a description of the employee. Users/AlanRaetz

20110617 11:20:12 nbsp Im a grad student and have been a TA a number of times, and the quality of work and level of professionalism that I tend to see at the Bike Barn is similar to what I see in class from undergrad students...  Sometimes you get an A student working on your bike and sometimes you get a C student.  Ive had people there who have been super helpful and have known exactly what they are looking at and talking about.  Ive also gone and paid for a repair, then picked up my bike to find the chain hanging off of it and a gear moved out of alignment.  The most convenient aspect of the Bike Barn is that it is on campus, but if my bike breaks down in town I usually take it elsewhere. Users/LindsayClark

20120529 09:28:34 nbsp The staffs were very helpful. I thought I would need to buy a new seat post (my bike seat broke and I could not take the seat off the seat post, so I went to the Bike Barn early in the morning and ask them if I need to buy a new seat post. They checked my bike seat and told me I dont need to buy a new one. They even helped me took off my broken bike seat(free of charge).   Users/SeanKing

20130417 18:29:13 nbsp Dont park your bike anywhere near the shop.  The signs that they have indicating that you should park elsewhere are paper, and the current wind can carry them away.  If you park there and run in to the Chem building, you may find your bicycle upside down but still in the same place because it is locked.

So Bike Barn, instead of being complete jerks about it, why dont you post some VISIBLE signs and let go of this passiveaggressive BS.  Thanks for trying to move my bike at least we know you arent even average thieves...not in that way, anyways. Users/DavidBarnum

20130426 08:53:38 nbsp David, I am sorry to hear about your experience using our bike racks. I do understand your concern with the way your bicycle was treated, and promise you that that is not our standard operating procedure when it comes to removing bicycles in our designated rental storage area. I will investigate your claim and find out if our staff was responsible for the incident, and if so, take appropriate action, although we may well find that your bike may have been mistreated by someone other than an employee of the Bike Barn (like another student, for instance.) We are working on posting better signage that will withstand the wind, and are making it clear which spots are available for public use and which are not. In the meantime, if you would like to discuss this in more detail, please drop us a line at the number posted on the top of our page, and we will be happy to help! Users/asucdbikebarn
