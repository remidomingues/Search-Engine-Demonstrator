Many bike and pedestrian bridges are a part of the Write The Bike Plan Davis Bike Plan, providing safe and efficient routes for bicyclists.  Bridges are located along many of the Greenbelts, adding to the bikefriendly character of Davis.  You can stop along our bike bridges to throw flowers petals into Arboretum Putah creek, or ride no hands and scream like a little school girl; either way, you will appreciate their sweet, sweet bicycle coolness.
