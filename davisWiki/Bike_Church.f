The Bike Church was located over by The Domes and is part of the Sustainable Research Area on campus. As of 2/1/2009, all activities at this location have ceased. The Bike Church has moved downtown under a new name. See Davis Bike Collective.

Their /Mission purpose is to give the community a lowcost resource that provides the knowledge and tools necessary to Bicycle Shops maintain and repair their various forms of humanpowered transportation, such as Bicycling. They have new and used bikes, parts, and accessories for donation along with tools and advice on how to fix your bicycles bicycle so you can get back to bicycling. The Church is nonprofit and operated by volunteers. Tithing: All dues go to providing the community with more tools and a better workspace. If you have a bike, bike parts or tools you are no longer using, please consider donating them to the Bike Church!

If you know something about bike repair, go Volunteer Opportunities volunteer. Just sign up on the schedule as an acolyte and show up at that shift. They also need some help organizing and making the space a bit more holy, as well as organizing with respect to the City and University. To see if your expertise could be used at the Bike Church, visit the /Improvement Plans improvement plans page.

Send a request to bikeministry AT gmail DOT com if you would like to be added to our congregation email list.  You will periodically receive emails about news and events related to the Bike Church and bicycling activities around the area, specifically events where you can help us further our mission.

Were always looking for new ministerswhether you know anything about bikes or not.  To become a minister, come to the church during open hours and talk to the minister on duty, he/she can show you around, find out how much you know and what you want to learn.  We also need more Friends of The Church or Monks and Nuns to help run operationsyou dont need to know how to fix bikes to help out, proselytize, or even be a minister!

20060416 13:38:48 nbsp I went to the bike church yesterday (2006415) with a bike badly in need of salvation. Ministers Tai and Jason were very helpful. With their guidance, I was able to see the light and restored something completely unrideable into a pretty cool bike for a small donation. I highly reccomend the Bike Church for those who have not found the Path of Righteousness. Users/ArlenAbraham

20060522 16:34:10 nbsp Hey, Im looking to not only build a bike from its component parts, but also build a bike trailer so I dont have to use a vehicle to go shopping or to the garden. I want to get saved! Users/KarlMogel
 20060523 11:46:37 nbsp Karl,  We definitely can help you get a bike going.  We have some trailer parts that may be restored with some work.  Here are a couple of good trailer options that are fairly easy to build: http://www.instructables.com/ex/i/A51076AC08D71029BC4A001143E7E506/ and http://drumbent.com/trailer.html . Users/JasonMoore

20060728 23:33:43 nbsp The bike church is a great resource and people ought to take advantage of it!  Every time I see somebody around town with a broken up bike or something wrong I tell them to go to the church (I should take my own advice, too!) Users/PhilipNeustrom

20061206 23:08:03 nbsp The bike church was awesome, I came there saying I needed a bike, and left, with greasy hands, proud of my handicraft, returned to add finishing touches, it was awesome, fun, and an experience better than any bike shopping trip, perfection. Users/DavidPoole

20070122 11:30:55 nbsp I was driving one day and BAM, god sent me a message. It was in the form of a dead tree, falling from the glorious sky it smashed my windshield and totaled my false idol.

20070407 03:55:21 nbsp hey there reverends. i became enlightened today when i saw the power of the bike goddess in the vision of a bright flier at the anderson and russel crosswalk! i noticed they were on all four corners! great advertising! now the grad has to compete with their advertising space. maybe i should privatize each light post and charge you to advertise on it!!

20070523 22:44:25 nbsp The Bike church is awesome...the guys are so helpful and knowledgeable...i love the place  Users/SoumenRoy

20070601 12:44:31 nbsp bike church is a good place to learn how to fix your own bike, but the downside is, is that it is hard to come by certain tools.  If you are a student and know what you are doing, the bike barn is usually a better place to fix your bike, they have everything youll need (except quality help). Users/KyleLanderhoffis
 What tools in particular does the bike church lack? My experience has been the opposite of yours: the bike church has a better selection of tools than the bike barn. If something important is missing, just tell a minister and someone will probably donate it or perhaps the church will buy it with their donation money. Users/WilliamLewis
 I have also been there a few times and found all the tools that I needed. More importantly the guys are so helpful and nice.  I however went last Friday to get a basket for my bike and did not find a usable one.Users/SoumenRoy

20070624 00:47:09 nbsp bike church is amazing. i brought an unrideable craigslist 70s era road bike in to be fixed up, and the minister on duty was very helpful. he explained everything clearly, helped us find all the parts we needed, and told us exactly what we needed to do to fix it (stepping in when we needed extra help). it now rides very smoothly!

I hate riding my peugot, and that is almost a crime in and of itself. I need at the very least a safety improvement, as my brakes cant crash stop...

and the axle needs to be changed out, etc. I just dont want to ride out to the domes on the bike of h8 and have there be no minister Users/StevenDaubert

20080404 10:00:28 nbsp I have a bike which has many problems, the biggest problem right now is that its locked to itself with a chain lock and I lost the key.  Is there a way to set it free? Users/CalamityJanie

 I have a similar issue with a previous housemate moving out and away and leaving his bike behind saying we can have it.  But he took the key with him.  So now we have this bike in our backyard that is locked up and doing nothing more than rusting and giving a home to spiders and such.  Anyone have any ideas of how to get use out of this bike (especially since my bike broke down and will supposedly cost $50+ since I know nothing on how to fix bearings)? Users/SunjeetBaadkar


20080410 16:26:59 nbsp Hi all,

Great work on cleaning things up.  Since you all have limited hours, how about an accessible locked cash donation box.  I think youd make some $$ from the people who stop by and scavenge stuff from the graveyard. Users/RichardJacobsen

20080506 15:36:25 nbsp So I was at the Bike Church, and I was thinking...imagine an organization like the Bike Church, except with computers.  Old computers are dirt cheap now, and completely useful.  Building computers for students or lowincome families or something.

Anyway, thanks to all the ministers at the Bike Church for all the help! Users/JoeyBennett

  That is a super idea.  There are free, lightweight versions of Linux that run fine for simple email and word processing on old, outdated computers.  It could be a fun project if theres a place to store the machines. Users/DanaSullivan

20080512 10:00:02 nbsp How do people feel about a Davis Peoples Free School bike workshop over the summer?  Would anyone actually show up to it?  I was thinking of a format along the lines of having a few bikes to take apart and put back together, which wed do together, and that way everyone get sort of a smorgasboard of bike formats and stuff if there were several bikes prepared for the course.  And since theyd all be functional bikes at the start, folks would know what bike mechanisms ought to look like... anyway, what Im saying is, Im looking for feedback.  Thanks, yall.  Oh, and are any ministers interested in running this with me?  Im thinking 2 nonbikechurch mornings in the early summer one to take the bikes apart, and another to put them back together. Users/SisterCat
 Hey SisterCat, this sounds like a great idea. What better way to learn about how a bike than to take it apart and put it back together? Id happily show up! Users/AllyAnaheim

 I, too, would gladly make it to a bike workshop like this! Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  Id be interested, too. Users/TaniaG
  I would show up. Users/scottmorgan

20080514 00:19:58 nbsp I would like to say the bike church is a true asset to students and average Davis folks who need you yes you rabbis & ministers. Simon and others are the coolest people helpful and pleasant Thank you bike church for what you do yes U!   Users/Brians

20080514 23:36:06 nbsp I went here today with a messed up tire, knowing nothing about how to fix a bike. Thankfully, the people there were really nice and patient and gave me instructions on what to do to fix it up... and now Ive learned how to replace it! Thank you bike church! :) Users/EvelinaChang

20080622 22:37:08 nbsp Okay, so as far as the workshop: Im going to do it as a part of Bikes are for Bitches this summer, but if youre a guy and want to come, thats okay: the idea behind BR4B is just that there is a space where people are conscious of an approach to mechanics outside the accepted norm our society holds it to.  Ive got a philosophy of cooperative, exploratory learning that I find is less intimidating to women and notsomacho guys and other nondominant personalities.  Pitching it to women is an oversimplification.  But hey, its something, right?

Okay, so the point is, come out to Bikes are for Bitches Sunday evenings for the bike stripdown/buildup workshop. Users/SisterCat

20080625 01:01:41 nbsp I had a moment of sharing today on the East side of campus. The nearconvert was in his truck looking for the bike place by the domes in order to make a donation (bike!). I hope he made it there after my unworthy directions. Users/robinlaughlin

20080704 12:28:26 nbsp I go to school part time and work full time.  Is there anything that you guys do on Sundays or Mondays?  Those are the only times I ever have free... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080708 10:30:17 nbsp i was wondering: are the summer hours the same? i.e. will the church be open tomorrow afternoon? ive got a bike in dire need of salvation... Users/paulwatkins

20080727 03:20:00 nbsp I went to the work party today and it was a lot of fun.  The people are friendly and it was a nice workout too.  Cant wait to see it all renovated.

20080801 10:30:05 nbsp My own work always seems to get in the way of me participating in Bike Church related things...:( Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081004 01:25:05 nbsp I bought a bike for way more than I should have on craigslist.  It needed some serious work.  The bike church was there for me.
Have you formed a personal relationship with your bike? Users/CodyDuncan

20081102 12:40:11 nbsp Instead of opting to buy a stock bike that my daughter would probably just outgrow in a year or two, I decided itd be fun to restore an older one. With a bike I picked up at the Bike Auction (well, about 75% of a bike, that is) and a bit of crank advice from the Swami, Ive finally finished the rebuild. Thanks Bike Church! Users/KevinChin

20081106 18:44:21 nbsp Hello one and all,

I just received this email and am enraged that Student Housing is demanding that the Church be shut down. Have they any idea what a beautiful part of the community the Bike Church is, not to mention how hard people worked to meet the SH safety standards? Read on and learn of the details, then REVOLT!

For those of you who havent already heard, the Davis Bike Church has
been evicted from its traditional stomping grounds of four years. This
is a major bummer for those whove relied on its tool, part, and
knowledge repositories, as the Bike Church is now in serious jeopardy.

To make a long story short, the Bike Church contacted various
University departments last year in an effort to coordinate a
renovation of the facility according to appropriate regulations. We
thought we were past the cease and desist stage and into the clean
up to standards stage of a grassroots organization, a belief based on
numerous communications between Bike Church Ministers and University
officials that demonstrated acknowledgment and approval of the Bike
Churchs existence on University property. Eventually, we got Student
Housing to give us a list of what needed to be done. Thus began the
Great Pedal Forward of the Summer of 08.

Through spending thousands of volunteer hours and over a thousand
dollars in community donations, we were able to complete a massive
renovation that included a floor for the dome, new cabinetry,
restructured facilities, and a level of organization never before seen
in our humble facilities. Despite efforts made to communicate with
appropriate departments about inspection and approval of our
facilities, the officials (except at EH&S) failed to work with us to
meet their demands. Nevertheless, we believed we were on track for
becoming an Universityapproved fixture in the Davis bicycling realm.
We had a final inspection scheduled for October 1st to decide the fate
of the Bike Church, until things suddenly changed.

After several shady unannounced inspections, Student Housing suddenly
canceled the walk through inspection. After several weeks of no
communication, we inquired about our fate. Chunk Huneke, the Student
Housing representative, declared that we were a liability and a fire
hazard, and due to our open membership to the Davis community and
intial establishment without specific approval, we must vacate and
dismantle our structures by December 1st and clear all traces of the
Bike Church from the Domes land by December 31st. This is a major
setback, but also a new opportunity. Were not exactly sure of the
future of the Bike Church, but we are investigating and pursuing all
options available. We are currently working on temporarily moving our
experimental education facility to the Experimental College gardens
before pursuing a closer relationship with the City of Davis, who has
supported us in the past and is doing all they can to help us in these
troubled times. However, this is still unsure.

How can you help?

This Saturday, November 8th, Delta of Venus is hosting the Save the
Bike Church Danceparty sponsored by New Belgium Beer and KDVS,
featuring DJs Mr. Glass, Dog Tones, and Deacon Morgan. There will be a
petition and letter writing station, as well as further information
about a demonstration occuring next week. Well have more information
about volunteering at the Bike Church, such as how to become a
minister. Anyone can get involved in our nonhierarchal consensus
organization, but were also looking for specialists in nonprofit
organization. Come check it out, whether to get involved or just to
show support by dancing the night away!

May your chain be supple and your wheels true,
Minister Darach
 Users/EliseKane

20081108 09:08:56 nbsp For those of us who cant attend events, who would be the best university person to write a letter to? Would it be Huneke, or someone else? They cant take the Bike Church away! Its an important community resource, especially for those of us who are poor and/or want to learn to fix our bikes ourselves. D:  Users/TaniaG

20081110 21:16:23 nbsp Now that the 11/8/08 fun & fundraiser is over, how else can people support the evolution of the Bike Church. In particular, where should money go? Users/DougWalter
    We are looking into setting up a PayPal account, but until then, you can come by the Church and donate money if youre local! Users/TyNowotny
    I work for a community business that was interested in making a donation; we dropped off some gift certificates at the Dance/fundraiser, and I guess well await developments. Users/DougWalter

20081116 14:05:20 nbsp What a joke. Ministers of what? Donations? Just like any other church. Why even call it a church? Call it what it is, a junk yard filled with pan handlers. Tylers a thief and a bum. Get a job asshole. To the dump with all of it, and hopefully something more useful will take its place. Users/rednoseroxy

20081117 23:41:13 nbsp Damn right sir! I think that bike parts are useless. What will you do with them, put them on bicycles to make them run? How barbaric! I think we should restore the Bike Church area to what it originally was, an open lot. Everyone can use another open lot!

And why should you call the place a church when it only approximates an alternative version of the public service and community building functions that a church has orginally filled in western society? How silly to name things appropriately!

And that Tyler guy, a major asshole! He walks around and tries to fix your bike, the jerk. I like the grinding noise my bike makes, to blazes if it seizes up five miles down the road, I like the sound it makes right now!

Bah humbug! Away with this knavery, I demand the University install a full service bicycle shop so I can have my bike fixed by wage slaves whilst I polish my nails. None of this bike DIY punkery of the plebians! Freedom through education and transportation independence? How quaint. Users/Darach

20090118 01:15:50 nbsp I visited the Church for the first time today and immediately got started on a beater project. It makes me very sad to think that it will be gone (hopefully temporarily) in two weeks. All the people there are super cool, too. Users/KellyM

20090128 10:12:14 nbsp The university wants us to cease operations asap. We will still run until 1/31, as per our agreement. After that, no one knows. Which is why we need people stepping up to volunteer, right now. We need people to give back. Users/Darach
  Is this still the issue with Student Housing, or has word come from a more general university authority?  Users/JonathanLawton
  What type of volunteer help do you need? Help ministering to people until you cant do it any longer, or help moving stuff to a storage location?  I could help with the latter if there was a masslets get the heck out of Dodge moving party.  Users/KevinChin
  Any news?

20090207 12:51:44 nbsp Ahhhh they were close on the 1/31. Thats the day I came to volunteer and no one was there. and a person needed to fix his bike. Well are they not here today? I was going to go up and volunteer. If there is no bike church anymore how do we start? But anyway, I am ready to volunteer! Users/chand3123k

20090313 22:25:46 nbsp We are closed, but people still hang out at the Bike Church sitemostly Domes residents.  People are still helpful and friendly, and the tools are still there for use pretty reliably on Wednesdays and Saturdaysits just not the Bike Church anymore.  In other words, the bike church is dead; long live the bike church!  You cant really stop it from operating, not as long as someone knows the shed combo and has some shred of a soul left. Users/SisterCat

20090403 10:26:10 nbsp Has anyone looked at the cost of renting a space of similar size?  There are many open places around Davis that could house the church, perhaps if we charged monthly dues we could afford an empty lot? Users/MasonMurray

20091106   The Bike Church was a unique place where far more than bicycle repair took place.   Interesting and diverse folks were always dropping by.  Getting to know them while sharing bike experience was its own reward.  Working in an open air environment under the trees and sun, and sometimes rain, was also very pleasant.   Wedged between the Domes and the EC Gardens it was as close to a bikers eutopia as possible.   And although not a church or religion in the normal sense, it was a place of tranquillity, where people with shared and fervent beliefs in green practices, sustainability and foremost bicycling, helped others.  I always liked its no nonsense atmosphere and felt it was a religion I could get a wrench on.  We miss you, Bike Church. Obijan Kenobi
