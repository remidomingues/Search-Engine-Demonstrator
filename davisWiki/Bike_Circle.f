A bike circle is an easy way for many Bike bikes to cross without anyone killing each other. At least, thats how its supposed to work. The Wiki Logo Davis Wiki Logo is based on the bike circle signs.

Always go around them counterclockwise (as seen from above). If you dont, someones bound to spot you and think youre a freshman. Worse yet, you could cause an accident. If youre a pedestrian, USE THE CROSSWALKS and dont walk through the bike circle. It slows traffic down and increases the risk of you getting hit.

Also critical to smooth bikecircling is to observe the proper rightofway: Bikes already in the circle have the rightofway over bikes entering the circle.

The area in the middle of a bike circle is usually thought of a Nomansland, since no one bikes through it, and few people rarely walk across it. It would be a perfect spot for a picnic in the fall, since youd have a good view of all the bike crashes  bring lawn chairs.

Similar schemes called Traffic Circle traffic circles or roundabouts, meant to accommodate motor traffic, are in place on roads in Davis and West Village.

In late August 2007, some of the Aggie Roundabout bike circles were painted with Aggie logos.

20051011 11:03:15 nbsp Since the space inside is wasted, why not fill it with a large round flower planter? It would be more even more effective than the bumps, plus it would add beauty and be environmentally friendly. Intersections waste a lot of space, enough for a large house look at the picture.

    Part of the reason the center area isnt filled is to allow large vehicles to use the intersection
    Because me and my friends get a kick out of setting up a few lawnchairs in the center with a few cold drinks and watching the newbies scream unneccessarily, crash, and start a domino effect around the entire circle.
    You also dont want anything in the middle of the circle so that you can easily see other bikes approaching the circle. Users/JimEvans

20060525 18:51:24 nbsp I actually for the most part WILL ride my bike right on through those bike circles(going in circles at 20mph is a pain(I wiped out once that way)) Users/DevinCastellucci

20061029 12:07:02 nbsp Part of the point of the circles at the intersection is to make you slow down. In addition to slower speeds being safer, it also makes all the traffic flow in one direction, which is safer than your standard intersection.  Users/MatthewTom

It really sucks when a large pack of roving students enters in the circle at the same time, forcing you to flow with them or cause a major incident, people go to slowly anyway. ~Users/Davidpoole
