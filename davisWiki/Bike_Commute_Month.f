Formerly Bike Commute Week (prior to 2006) and then Bike Commute Month, in 2008 the name was changed to May is Bike Month to promote bicycling for recreation and errands as well as for commuting to work and school. May is Bike Month is an annual promotion, held in May, to recognize the Bicycles bicycle as a viable alternative to the automobile. May is Bike Month covers the entire Sacramento region. For those on Facebook, there is also a http://www.facebook.com/mayisbikemonth?refts fan page.

Note from a former Bike Commute Week participant: This event is a great first step if you are investigating becoming Carfree in Davis carfree.

The annual breakfast, sponsored by Yolo Transportation Management Association, UC Davis and the City of Davis, has become a mainstay in Davis.  This years breakfast will be held from 7:009:00 AM on Wednesday, May 19, 2010 in Central Park.  Each year cyclists meet at the park to share a hearty breakfast of bagels, muffins and fruit in a relaxing atmosphere.  Its a great way to begin your work day!  May is Bike Month Tshirts will be available for those registered to log miles.
