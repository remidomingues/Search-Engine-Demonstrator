Bike Forth is a DIY bicycle shops bicycle repair shop operated by the Davis Bike Collective. In contrast to the other shops where you just drop off your bike, pick it up later and get a bill, Bike Forth is an interactive shop where its about the relationship, the personal experience. When you go there, you will be greeted by someone asking what you need help with. They might explain that they will give expert diagnosis, provide tools, provide parts, and give space but you will largely do the work yourself on your own bike. The point is about you learning, and thus becoming more independent and perhaps able to fix your bike all by yourself next time. (Note that becoming independent and selfreliant is contrary to the commercial system which seeks to keep you ignorant and thus dependent.) Where else can you get training by experts for next to nothing? Prices for all services are set by nominal donation, which keeps them affordable for all.


What does it cost?
You wont find definitive prices at Bike Forth  payment is flexible, its all about fairness, equity, ability, and inclination. This is strange, eh?, but we hope you get the drift.

To be clear, we ask for $5 donation per hour spent in the shop, and a fair contribution for whatever parts and materials are used (we do have a recommended donation range for each type of part).  In lieu of a donation were also happy to have your time in worktrade; we ask for an hour of your time for an hour of shop use.  Note that donating bike parts is a wonderful thing to do, but it doesnt count toward shop credit.  There have been so many concerns about people potentially laundering stolen bikes through the shop that weve had to take a hard line on this.  You can, however, get a tax receipt for donating bikes and parts if you request it.

Keep in mind that there are many real and significant expenses to run Bike Forth (including rent, insurance, utilities, improvements), its in your hands to contribute enough to keep the community shop afloat.

FREE METAL RECYCLING: The stuff in the metal recycling area next to the dumpster is free to the public.  A metal scavenger comes by and picks it up, but reuse is better than recycling, so take what you need! Bike Forth occasionally triages old unused parts.  If theyre open, check to confirm that youre looking at the right pile of stuff.  If theyre closed, metal recycling should be the only stuff (if any) left outside next to the dumpster.

FREE VERY FLAT TUBES: When Bike Forth is open, there are sometimes flat tubes in the orange trash bin.  These make excellent bungee cords and can expand your bike racks carrying capacity. Flat tubes not in the orange trash bin can be repaired and used as tubes and should not be considered free bungee cords. Other bike shops may also sometimes have bike tubes in the trash for you if you ask.

Regular Open Shop
Come by to use tools, fix your bike(s), drop off donations, pick up some sweet parts, and learn skills during these hours.  Our volunteers are in the shop to help you out and guide you through whatever you may need to do.
