Bike jousting involves two cyclists jousting with large padded lances. It is an honorable combat sport, and often involves the consumption of alcohol to fortify the spirit. One place to find it is at the annual Burning Bike Festival. Two lances reside at the Bike Church, ready for use.

One rule:
Dont hit the bike.
