In addition to the Bike tunnels there are also a number of bikeonly overpasses in town.

There are two over Highway 113, one over Interstate 80 and one over Covell Blvd.

 Covell Bike Overpass 

Underneath this overpass is a good place to see Bats bats at dusk.



 Northern Highway 113 Bike Overpass 

Connects West Davis to the Sycamore Park Park at Robert E. Willett School WDI


 Southern Highway 113 Bike Overpass 

Here are some pictures taken from the bike overpass over 113, which connects Orchard Park Circle on the east to (eventually) Russell Blvd. on the west.


If you visit that overpass in the middle at the right time of night and the right time of year, you will see a frenzy of preying mantises playing, sitting, sexing it up, and chewing each others heads off. Its quite a bizarre sight to see.

 I 80 Bike Overpass 

This links the two sides of 80 out by Chiles Road.
