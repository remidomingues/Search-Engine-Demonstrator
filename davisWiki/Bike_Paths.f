There are 55 miles of bike paths in Davis. They lead to Bike Overpasses overpasses and Bike tunnels tunnels. Be careful, thoughalthough many are great, they arent all in good repair.

When classes change at UC Davis (10 minutes before the hour in the morning, and 10 minutes after the hour in the afternoon) there is a great rush of students on bicycles. In the early fall most of the freshmen on bikes are learning how to navigate the traffic circles.
