 STOLEN NIGHT OF DECEMBER 5, 2013 IN EAST DAVIS  BAKFIETS 
My daughters Bakfiets was stolen from their apartment complex on East 8th Street overnight.  It was chained to another bike and a pole in the parking lot with a heavy duty chain.  It also has a lock integrated into the rear wheel which can only be unlocked with a key. The other bike was locked to the Bakfiets with a ulock.  Both the chain and ulock were removed somehow and, curiously, the other bike was left behind.  We are beyond sad about this since this is our daughters only means of transporting her 2 children (1 and 4).  As a family we have been car free since 2003 and my children (both adults) have never driven cars, relying solely on public transportation, their feet and bikes.  This is like someone stealing a familys only car.

STOLEN WEDNESDAY NOV. 13 (11/13/2013) WHITE/BLACK 2010 Mens Novara Matador

Taken from in front of my apartment at Cranbrook. The image shown is from when I first purchased the bike; Serial Number is A1249979 (I think, thats the number I have on my owners manual). It has 29in tires so it stands out a little more than a standard bike. I have crashed it a couple times so there is a scratch on the lower crossbar near the fork. The front reflector is also gone, but the plastic clamp that used to hold it is still on the handlebar. The seat was also damaged in a crash so now it can be lifted up on one side because the metal bar holding it down snapped. It also has a black (fairly faded now) underseat pouch. Frame size is medium. The front derailer is stuck in 2nd gear as I didnt get a chance to fix it before it was stolen.


Please email gustolley@gmail.com if you have any information. Im offering a cash reward for its return or information about where it is.

STOLE MY BIKE BUT LEFT ANOTHER!!
STOLEN AND FOUND

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
If you are the person who stole my bike, please return it. Like you, I am a poor college student. I live here with my wife (who is also a student) and 3 kids. We are undergrads just starting out. My 7 year old daughter loves to go riding with me and cried when you took my bike. You may have noticed the kid trailer sitting next to my bike, as well as the trailer hitch on the rear hub. I am no longer able to transport my children to and from day care and school (north davis elementary). I do not own a vehicle, so that bike was my only transportation. You took the bike right before Christmas, the worst time financially for any struggling family.

Please return the bike... The bike you left is still here. I will not ask any questions, I have no desire to get you in trouble. I have to think that the fact you left your bike and took mine means it was a spur of the moment decision, we all make mistakes. Please come return my bike and take the one you left. You do not even have to come at night, just come whenever. If I see you, I will smile and say thank you. Have a merry christmas and think about what Ive said, please. 


Sometime between 2am and 10am Dec 13th, This bike was stolen from Solano Park Apartments, building 1800 at UC Davis. It is a white Marin  Palisades. Not many, if any in the Davis Area. The picture below is a stock photo, but it looks identical to this. It also has a headlight on it cateye and a cellphone cell phone mount on the handle bars. I am offering a $500 reward.

Serial Number: CA11243ISD099

Model: Palisades Trail  White

26 Wheels, 19 Frame

Again, $500 reward for information that leads to the return of the bike.

Also, the thief left me a bike.. Is this the Bike swap? I suppose it was considerate of him to leave me a bike in return, however, the bike he left me is likely also stolen, so I am also adding a found to my Stolen report.

Contact me:

FOUND
This bike was left in front of my apartment in Solano Park Apartments. It is a black Overload Thruster. It has blue tires. If this is your bike, maybe we can pool our resources and locate mine as well. I am going to let the police know as well that this was a drop and grab bike theft. Maybe it will help.. who knows.

Stolen from staircase in front of apartment door (where it remained hidden from street view) at 2949 Portage Bay West apt complex friday november 30 sometime after 9pm. (Perhaps you attended a party at my neighbors and know something about it?).




If you come across these bikes or want to right your wrongs email rbhatt@ucdavis.edu.









$100 REWARD!
Bring me my stolen bike, Ill give you $100.
Give me the name of the person that stole it, and proof it was them, Ill toss in another $50.



It should be noted that in this photo I had eggbeater style pedals on it. It had platform pedals on it at the time of theft.

Here are the details:

Someone stole my bike between 10:30am and 12:30pm on Thursday, November 29th while I was in physics lab. It was locked via a Ulock and cable lock to the racks outside the Earth & Physical Sciences building on campus.

Bike details:
2006 Leader brand, 722 yellow frame with word Leader in black lettering. Other tubes on frame also branded Leader  Worlds Finest
Shimano 105 Flightdeck groupset, with the words Flightdeck on top of each front shifter.
Aluminum handlebars, wrapped with red tape and electrical tape at time of theft.
Standard, platform pedals with orange reflectors on them.
Black, carbon fiber front fork, also branded with the word Leader on the top of the left side.
Origin8 brand seat.
Carbon fiber seat downtube with attachments for seat bag. Currently had a fender attached to it when stolen.
Attachments for a bike light and bike computer on the front handlebars.
Red and black Velomax wheels, with smooth racing slick style tires.

The bike was locked up to a bike rack with a cable lock, and a Kryptonite brand U lock at the time of theft. Neither were left at the scene of the crime.

This is the ONLY yellow/orange Leader brand bike in the Davis area, and certainly the only 2006 model (featuring special russian styled lettering on the bike tubes). Simply put, if you see the bike, you will know what it is. It is highly conspicuous.

IF YOU STOLE IT AND ARE READING THIS, YOU CAN RETURN IT WITHOUT ISSUE. ALL I WANT IS MY BIKE BACK, BRING IT BACK TO ME, AND WE WONT HAVE AN ISSUE. HELL, YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE REWARD.

But be warned, if you do not return it, and I find out who you are, you will regret the moment you ever laid hands on my property.
I promise you that.

Description

It has an all white with black accessories (see the link below for an image).

http://www.productwiki.com/upload/images/trek_soho_s_satin_white.jpg

I bought the bike from Kennewick Cycle and Fitness in Kennewick, WA. It has a shop sticker at the base of the frame near the pedals.

There is scratches on the handle bars and brake levers from when I crashed it a year ago.

The nuts that hold the wheels into place are rusty.

The top part of the frame is pretty grimey and has black smudges all over it from where I locked my bike lock to it when riding.

It makes a distinctive clicking sound when riding it.

I replaced the bar grips with these:

black spray painted aluminum (?) frame with climbing stickers
brand & model unknown
compression shocks on front

The bike may have been in park for several days before I picked it up.  I posted a sign near the location where I found the bike and also left a message with Davis police lost and found.

March 24 night or 25th early am

Our bikes, helmets, locks, and all accessories were stolen from our carport in Central Davis.  While we have little hope of recovering the bikes (a grey Trek Mountain bike, probably 3 series but cant recall, and a black/white Mens Fuji Finest road bike), our brandnew bike trailer was also taken.  This trailer is all but unique in Davis, as it was specialordered from a small company in Canada.  Its called a WIKE and is yellow/blue with the word WIKE on the rear, and it has a rather unusual shape when compared to the Burley, etc.  Heres what it looks like!  Please contact me if you see this anywhere! edubin at gmail.com

Note: I also feel compelled to say that this trailer is RAD and we are hurting from the loss.  Everyone should probably check out wicycle.com  they also have trailers for freight, pets, and special needs people.

STOLEN: Very Unusual 3 Wheeled Bike
stolen this Winter, not sure exactly when.

I know, lame, I dont know exactly when it was taken.  However, this bike was being stored at my friend Bill Smiths house.  A friend of his borrowed it and whilst being borrowed, it was stolen.  It is such an unusual bike, in fact part of it was given to me by the great Davis Bikester Geoff Greene. I hope if someone sees it, theyll help it get back to me or to Bill.  You can contact me at 5307572419 ext. 14 or email radiothisweekendonly@yahoo.com.

March 7th, 2011

Asparagus green GT Transeo with gold lettering/rims, and Wheels 4 Life printed around the frame
Stolen March 7th overnight likely with bolt shears on the lock.


Its easily identifiable due to the strange green color and gold rims, and a few unique modifications I made, so if you see this bike around please call me at (951) 5005949 and leave a message. It was only sold in limited production last year so its pretty rare.

If you happen to buy it somewhere you will be given compensation for what you paid, no questions asked. I just want my bike back. :(

Raleigh Calispel i8  Brown  X Stolen evening Feb 27, 2011 X RECOVERED April 15, 2011

X My bike was taken from out front of Shields Library sometime between 4:30 and 7:45pm. It WAS locked, but someone mustve cut the cable. This bike is my only way of getting around/onto campus (from West Davis), was rather expensive, and I was godawful fond of it. Finder gets $150, no questions asked. I just want a little piece of my life back. Contact at 3025626688 or email djvillatucdavisdotedu. X

I miraculously recovered my (original) bike Friday, April 15, 2011, when I saw a guy riding it at F & 9th, chased after him on my own bike, and managed to stop him and convince him to turn the bike over to me in exchange for a little cash. While 95% of this outcome was sheer, dumb luck (Im never at that particular corner), 5% was my (previously unbeknownst) hostilenegotiating skill. Im planning on posting something to the Wiki soon to describe how I did it so others can have a chance of recovering their stolen bikes in the highly rare but not impossible case that you see somebody riding it (or what looks like it) around campus/town.

Distinctive features: male style, rear rack (black) w/ two side baskets, internal rearwheel shifter (looks like a large hub), license #4070007, serial # 01007T.

STOLEN!: Masi Soulville 3 on Feb. 13, 2011

The bike was locked in the bike racks on the east side of Trader Joe’s in the University Mall (885 Russell Blvd.).

The bike has brown cork handles and a brown seat with sequinlike buttons embedded in it.  The frame is white with two patches of red, each with “Masi” inscribed in black lettering, and “Soulville” written across the top bar.  The bike also has silver metal fenders and the Serial # is C80909905.  I just bought it a few weeks ago and desperately want it back.

STOLEN: Black Mercier Kilo TT fixed gear. All original, no added features except for the brakes bought from APEX. It got stolen right in front of the Haring Hall on the California Avenue, I locked the front wheel and the frame with a UBar and parked it in the bocks on the sidewalk. I just finished my last final of the year only to find out that my bike got stolen. It was within 2 hours that this incident happened (10:30am12:30pm). Specific feature on the bike is that the front wheel is out of true a little bit and the rings that support the handle bar to the frame does not fit well, so it makes a little noise when going on bumpy roads. The handle bar has some scratch on the right side and the right pedal is also damaged. Please help me find my bike, I do not want to start my summer like this. There will be a reward. Thank you.

June 9, 2010

Found: Julia Athans, a Davis resident, attempting to sell me my own bike. I cant prove that she stole it, but four weeks after someone cut the lock and carted it off she posted it on Craigslist. I posed as a buyer. She said she found it in a bush. I had a police report and photos to ID the bike and, in any event, as soon as she was confronted she began apologizing and making up various contradictory explanations... Not very impressive. She did not object to having her photo taken, so I am posting that here for all to see. Whoever cut the lock gave me a flat front tire while doing it, which goes to show bike thieves are not the brightest LEDs in the CatEye. Good luck to you all in locating your lost bikes   the cops werent much help to me (in fact talking to them was discouraging) but browsing Craigslist regularly did pay off, in my case.

STOLEN: Yellow Centurion road bike with yellow handlebars. Taken right outside Golden 1 while I was at the ATM. Identifying characteristics is that there is dual brake/shifter for the rear derailleur but a shifter on the down tubes controls the front derailleur. Offering a reward, especially for the rear skewer which was machined to fit a trailer from a defunct company.

STOLEN: Blue Trek Road Bike with yellow writing and Goldish/Bronze Handlebars.  It was taken outside of my apartment building in the bike racks at University Village.  I miss my bike.

STOLEN: Black Specialized Allez road bike.  Stolen in front of Thompson hall in Segundo.  When it was stolen it had white handlebar tape, a white and silver bontrager saddle, and a black pyrotec carbon fiber seat post.  It is black with white writing and is registered.  This bike is extremely dear to me so please let me know if you see it. If returned there will be a reward.  Please contact me at 831 331 7848 or e mail me at bowilliamson@ucdavis.edu. Thank you

March 3031, 2010
STOLEN: Red Honda Racing Trail Pilot. Stolen off campus from The Lexington Apartments on Olive Drive from a bike rack right outside my unit. Thief used bolt cutters to cut my bike chain lock (I learned my lesson about not using Ulocks). This bike is very uncommon and if you see one on campus, it is probably mine (trust me, Ive searched all over campus and looked at thousands of bikes).
Description: Red in color, at time of theft it had red duct tape on the handlebar, which was used to secure a bike light mount (there were 2 of these attached), cheap $15 fenders, and a nice wide seat bought from target (I forget the brand). Here is an image of the particular bike model, my stolen bike looks almost exactly like this (except for the modifications just described) I had to buy a replacement bike, which I really could not afford to do, so PLEASE I really need this bike returned to me.

If you have ANY information, please contact me at zaargg@gmail.com
You can also call me at 9166178014 if you see the bike somewhere. Be careful to check that it is a Trail Pilot and not a Trail Winder, however. I now ride a Trail Winder as a (hopefully temporary) replacement.
The bike was registered with TAPS, and I carry the TAPS registration card on me at all times and can verify the serial number if needed.


March 19, 2010 11AM/12PM
Stolen: Burley Solo trailer on UCDavis campus right in front of Hickey gym / bus turning circle between 11am and 12pm. They used bolt cutters to cut the lock and amazingly left the bike.
