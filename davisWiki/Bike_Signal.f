There are bike signals at:

  Russell Boulevard & Sycamore Lane
  Alhambra Drive & Mace Boulevard Mace Blvd.
  Arlington Boulevard Arlington & Shasta
  Pole Line Road & Loyola Drive
  Oak Avenue Oak Ave. & West Covell Boulevard

The most important thing is if youre driving  DO NOT TURN RIGHT when the bike signal is green. You can take out people entering the intersection from that corner if you do.  A symbol for No Right Turn illuminates for the cars on Sycamore facing Russell.  Other than that, its just a cool little reminder that you live in the bike capital of the world.

The law that allows for those Bicycles Must Obey Bicycle Signal signs expired on January 1, 2005, but was renewed.

Russell and Sycamore is reportedly the first bike signal in the world.

Drivers who turn right against the bike light are generally considered to be rude and inconsiderate  theyve been waiting for cars to stop coming from Russell, and they dont bother to pay attention to the traffic light, and the fact that they might kill someone. I used to see this happen at least once a day before they made a more visible no right turn on red sign.

Drivers who turn left against the bike light are generally given the benefit of the doubt by bikers  theyre probably got confused and are so embarrassed about their mistake that theyll never do it again. Ive never seen this happen more frequently than once every few weeks.  Users/KenBloom

As a pedestrian, I was hit by a guy turning right against the bike signal. I fell into his hood, gave him the finger and went on my merry way. In restrospect, I should have tried to hit my head really hard and start bleeding, but at the moment, I was more concered with crossing the street.  Users/arlenabraham arlen

20050212 20:13:10 nbsp Id imagine that Hong Kong is the bike capital of the world.  Were just the bike capital of the US. Users/JabberWokky

To my knowledge, we have the highest nuber of bicycles per capita in the world.  Hong Kong has a crapload more bikes, but only because they have a super crapload more people.

20050213 00:07:47 nbsp http://www.vote.org/ravitz/daily195.htm Boulder claims a higher per capita ownership, but fewer riders.  Holland (and especially Amsterdam) also claims more bikes than people.  Those figures are harder to get (darn nonenglish speakers).  I think Hong Kong has the highest riders per capita, but thats an unverified I think it was on Discovery or History Channel memory.  Davis is up there, and very bike friendly and bike focused. Users/JabberWokky

20050213 02:28:06 nbsp The most unfortunate thing about this signal is no matter how distinct the design looks up close, its still just a red and green light. To try to solve this problem theyve gone through at least two seperate lit PLEASE DONT TURN NOW signs to alert the motor vehicles; kind of defeating the purpose, dont you think? I know that even though I lived in Emerson for a year and biked through that intersection at least twice a day, when I drive up to it and see the green bike signal Im still eversotempted subconciously to turn. Basically I think it should be purple or something. Users/TravisGrathwell

20050213 16:17:17 nbsp When I first got to Davis I didnt understand.  I thought hey, thats funny.  A green signal in the shape of a bike.  Wow.  They really the bike capitol of the world.  This was at 3am, with no bikers around, so it didnt really occur to me that it was signal for bikes.  Users/JaimeRaba

20050213 16:18:28 nbsp With respect to the bikes per capita, I happened across some statistics on Wikipedia that indicated that Davis has almost twice as many bicycles as people.  Maybe thats why were ahead of Holland?  Good ol competing stats are assuredly out there. Users/JaimeRaba

20060105 19:10:51 nbsp Any info on how old that bike signal at Russell and Sycamore is? Users/JoFeuerstein
    1990 according to http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pw/pdfs/2006_BikePlan_withMaps.pdf this city bike plan {3.5mb pdf} Users/EdHenn

20060106 01:21:30 nbsp When I first got to Davis, I first encountered one of these signals at night. And I thought how funny!  One of the lights is in the shape of a bike!  It didnt occur to me (despite the shape of the light) that the light was ONLY for bikes.  The next day, when all the bikes were lined up in front of it... and and the fact the two lights didnt behave the same way also somehow made sense.  Oh, and then theres the funky no turn on red sign at Sycamore.  I know there is a special law that makes the bike stoplights legal, but I wonder about the no turn sign.  I have a hunch that it might not be up to code... but it would be worth checking out. Users/JaimeRaba
  Apparently the law gives municipalities the option to provide appropriate signal indications or changeable message signs . . . to meet the requirements for the variable rightturn mode.  In laymans terms, it says that because the right turn is both allowed and prohibited at different times, then the city can install appropriate signs or signals to keep traffic moving safely. The specific law can be found http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/signtech/mutcdsupp/ca_mutcd.htm here in section 4D.07D. However, there could be more pertinent language that I didnt find. If anyone wants to do more research the specific sign is called a blankout no turn sign.

20060505 10:49:57 nbsp Okay, this is really not hard evidence, but for example the College Town of Leuven (Belgium) has about 90000 people, but A LOT of bikes, I would contend more than Davis.

20070615 11:54:05 nbsp Unfortunately biking has been (is?) becoming less popular at Davis  according to Census statistics the fraction of people biking has dropped from a high of 22% to 15% (19902000). This does not even beat the national average of the Netherlands (26%) or even Denmark (20%). Im not sure which city in the world is most bike intensive, in the same article it states that in Groningen (a city in the Netherlands with three times the population of Davis) 37% of all trips are made by bike! We have some catching up to do...
