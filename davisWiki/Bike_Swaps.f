This page lists any Bike Swaps in the area. Some people would like to know about any Bicycles Bike Swaps on the West Coast but we should probably keep it to Adventures Outside of Davis within a days drive of Davis, but if you know of one, just list it here anyway so we can get a good list going. Its very very easy to miss these, usually because advertising for the events is poor. If you have information on related events, such as bike shows, swaps, expos, races, rides, or any other bicycle events, please put them on this page.

 Local Bike Swaps & Events 

Davis Bike Swap/Foxys Fall Century & Bike Swap
There is usually very little notice before this swap unless you are part of the bike club, so its usually very small. This fall it coincided with Foxys Fall Century ride. If someone could provide more information about this, it would be much appriciated.
