Bike Traps refer to a specific time when the Davis Police Department and the UC Davis Police Department send out many police officers to give out tickets for bike violations.  The most visible bike traps are usually done during the beginning of fall quarter. The reason for this is that the majority of students who dont come from Davis do not know or follow all the bicycle traffic laws that are strictly enforced in Davis. The biggest bike sting in school history so far occurred on the second Friday night of fall quarter 2006. Here several cop cars drove around campus handing out bike light violations so constantly that they were waving down multiple cyclists at a time.  In fact, they were handing out so many tickets, that cyclists waited in a line to receive a ticket once flagged down by the cop.  Other bike traps often occur on 3rd Street, where city cops, either on bikes or motorcycles, ticket students for not stopping at the stop signs that occur at almost every block downtown.  Citations can be in excess of $200.00, but the citation or the officer will not tell you exactly what you have to pay until you get your citation processed by the traffic division at Yolo County Superior Court.

If a police officer gives you trouble for riding your bike in a sidewalk, theyre likely wrong. Cite http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc21650.htm VC 21650(g).

Bike light violations often lead to a correctable citation, where one must go to the police station with a bike light and get an officer to sign off that there is now a working light on the bike.  Then you mail the signature to the court along with a processing fee of 10 dollars.  However, stop sign violations usually receive full tickets.  Also note that the campus speed limit is 15 MPH and campus police officers are well known to stop people for bicycling through campus too quickly.

 Frequent Locations of Bike Traps 
  On Campus 
   Especially for bike light violations, the bike loop between Shields Library and Hart Hall is a popular place.
   The stop sign next to The Domes when coming east from the bike overpass that crosses Highway 113. Excellent spot for a trap, but in my 5+ years of daily riding here, I almost never see police. Users/JonathanLawton JL
   The stop sign at Hutchison and Bioletti, across from 123 Sciences Lecture Hall Sci Lec.
  In Town 
   Downtown: especially for stop sign violations on 3rd st. (intersections on D Street D st., E Street E st., and F Street F st. seem to be the most frequent locations)
   Corner of 3rd Street and A Street Right next to Offcampus Books.  Because of the visibility and slowmoving oneway traffic, most bicyclists blow this stop sign.
   The intersection of Sycamore Lane & 8th Street.


20070321 15:31:04 nbsp If I ever get a speeding ticket on my bicycle, I might be inclined to frame it. Users/DavidGrundler

20070321 15:41:22 nbsp Id just like to mention that the first two locations seem vague compared to the others. Should these be removed? Also, Campus Police have been known to stop bikes for not having bike liscences. Users/MyaBrn

20070321 19:31:43 nbsp So bike stings are different from the bait bike program that is slated to start soon? Users/StevenDaubert

20070321 21:26:51 nbsp Bait bike?  Whats this? Users/DavidGrundler

20070322 05:28:26 nbsp Good question.  Here, let me help make it easy:  What is this Bait Bike of which you speak? Users/WesHardaker

20070322 15:57:34 nbsp I saw a bike the other day that I thought was bait, cause I was like what kind of IDIOT would leave that nice of a bike unattended and unlocked? Users/BradBenedict

20070324 09:37:41 nbsp this year i must have seen at least 50 tickets given out on 3rd st. for stop sign violations.  Huge increase considering last school year i only saw maybe one or two per quarter Users/MattHh

20070515 01:07:55 nbsp wouldnt it be kind of easy to evade from a cop in a car on campus such as the one shown in the picture? i like to see them chasing you down through campus with a bajillion other bikers riding around. Besides, there are so much on campus where a cop car cant go through. Ill probably have second thoughts if the cop is on a motorcycle instead of a car. I also would not try it unless i got some sort of higher end road bike. Users/KaiWan
 You really dont need all that good of a bike to stand a decent chance of evading the police. Id say 25 would be a good speed to evade a cop car on campus and thats easily achievable by a rider in decent shape with an entry level  (not department store) road bike or hybrid in decent repair. That being said, I dont endorse evading the police unless its clear that theyre a threat to your life. Users/WilliamLewis wl
 Ive found its also easy to walk out on restaurant bills and to otherwise evade personal responsibility.  You might consider the larger social ramifications of that act versus the purely physical aspect.  Although from a thought experiment point of view, I would be interested to see how they would handle it.  Likely their radio is faster than your bike and they have experience handling that particular move. Users/JabberWokky

20070520 01:57:19 nbsp enforcement of stop sign law is a joke Users/KaiWan

20070520 11:07:43 nbsp A joke perhaps, but theyll still pull you over for it. My Intersection of IllRepute is Cowell Boulevard Cowell and Research Park Drive Research Park, near Wendys. Got fined for a stop signal violation (in a car) turning right onto Cowell next to the gas station (the stop was, shall we say, debatable). Also got stopped on the other side of the intersection by a motorcycle cop after turning making a right turn on my bike. This time around, only a warning was given: a good reminder that, as a bicycle, you still have to obey the signals as a car would. I have since opted to take the Bike Paths Putah Creek Parkway which gets me home almost as quickly as Cowell, and avoids exposure to car traffic, four signals, and a whole lot of unwanted scrutiny. Users/KevinChin

20070523 11:36:38 nbsp Yeah, its not like law enforcement sic would ever target hostile anticyclist harassing motorists with a sting. Users/jimc

20070523 11:55:46 nbsp That reminds me, I was riding out Mace two Sundays ago early in the AM.  There was no traffic, so I was riding next to my sister.  She was on the line, and I was right next to her, still to the right of the lane.  We hadnt seen any cars since crossing Chiles, and we were out where the little bridge is that crosses the creek.  I kid you not, a CHP officer drove by us doing 75 or so (extremely fast) and only gave me about a foot to spare. Users/DavidGrundler

20070928 13:15:59 nbsp I hear running a stop sign is $134.00.

20070930 16:24:58 nbsp Ticking at 3rd & A is a bit ridiculous, but its really common.  There is complete visibility of traffic, a oneway, singlelane street, and a large, visible crosswalk and stop sign (that cars can see).  On the same note, its really easy to see when theres a cop there, but I have the feeling that many still blow the sign, with the knowledge that theres a cop there, because its a silly idea to slow down for no reason here.  I think the stop sign that faces the campus side of the intersection should be converted to a yield sign, unless theres been an unusual number of accidents here.  Cops could still issue tickets to cyclists who blow the yield when theres a car waiting, and I dont see how itd be any less safe.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070930 21:14:39 nbsp I think the city of davis blieves that giving tickets to kids on bikes is a reliable income source.  Some of the correct paths are ridiculously hazardous and dangerous.  Others (like biking a mile instead of walking over train tracks) are completely ludicrous. Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20071001 20:25:23 nbsp Im new to cycling in Davis...what do the Davis and UC PD consider a legal, complete stop by a bicyclist at a stop sign?  An LA cop once told me that unless a cyclist stopped with both feet on the ground at a stop sign, hed write a ticket.  Is that what DPD expects too, or can a rider get away with a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_stand track standstyle stop? Users/DukeMcAdow

  My guess is that it depends on the cop. However, I allways thought it was one foot down. I didnt know it was 2. In LA i have never run into a cop who stopped bikes. I thought ticketing bikers was a davis thing. Interesting. Users/MattHh
   Come to think of it, we rode up and down the coast every weekend, so it mightve been a police officer in one of the beach cities  Hermosa, Redondo or someplace in OC  not LA Users/DukeMcAdow

  I know someone who got ticketed because they didnt put their feet down. However, that isnt the law and they successfully got the ticket thrown out. Ive done California stops in front of cops and Ive never been ticketed. Your milage may vary. wl

  I once talked to a bike cop (after he gave me a ticket) and he told me that a foot down on the ground has nothing to do with whether you stopped. In other words, you can stop without putting any feet down and you can fail to stop even though a foot touched the ground. Users/JimEvans

  No foot down is necessary. Simply cease all forward momentum. Ref CalVC section 22450 (a). Users/NickLaForge

20071002 19:26:32 nbsp Part of the enforcement might be the source of income referred to earlier, but much of the value of bike tickets and stings early in the quarter is their indirect effect.  Hand out a few $100 dollar tickets and word gets around really fast that bikes have to stop at stop signs and have lights.  The rate of compliance, or at least nearcompliance (e.g. semistop instead of blowing through), probably increases a lot even with unticketed new cyclists just from hearing about the law and consequences as a result of the ticketed folks complaining.  Ticketing at the easy 3rd Street intersection probably has a higher rate of return than at a more dangerous one, but the same spillover to the ones where not stopping is a real danger. Users/NotTires

20071002 21:41:51 nbsp Speaking of dangerous intersections, why dont the cops sit at the Olive Dr and Richards intersection and ticket cars running the red light turning left to go south on Richards?  Ive been hit by a car while on my bike and a few months later saw the same thing happen to someone else.  Having to face that intersection everyday made me stick to crossing the tracks rather than go on the path across Richards. Users/MonicaWilliams

20071003 14:32:54 nbsp Are there any other (known) violations one can be ticketed for outside of stop sign and bike light violations?  I saw a kid stopped by a Davis bike cop this afternoon at the Putah Creek bike undercrossing over by one of the tunnels.  Users/LeightonHinkley
 You can be cited for violating any traffic law that could possibly apply to a bike, such as failure to yield, speeding (I really want that one!), dui, and failure to signal. wl
   You can also be cited for riding on the sidewalk in certain areas of mostly downtown (where all the NO BIKES OR SKATEBOARDS markings are).  I want to be cited for speeding, too; Ive certainly done it enough.  And most potential BUI (Biking Under the Influence) citations are given out as moving violations, since thats an easier process. Users/BrettHall

20071006 11:36:54 nbsp Never understood these.  Most people that get fixit tickets for bike lights end up just stealing lights from other bikes.  Vicious cycle. Users/SeatonTsai

 Thats not true. Maybe some do, but i dont think most do. I think the fix it ticket is a pretty good idea. And dont people either screw on their lights or take it off when they part? Users/MattHh

20071008 21:45:55 nbsp Ridiculous. The Davis police are so busy extorting bikers that they have no time to enforce greater laws like theft. Maybe theyre too busy counting their money. Users/AlexKou
  I was under the impression that they were enforcing laws. I was pulled over on my bike last year for running a stop sign and luckily I was let off with a warning. They arent extorting students and unless you can prove that they are mishandling theft cases, you shouldnt make accusations like that. Users/TusharRawat Tushar
    Ok, so here is the point ... you should have enough police to stop rape, murder, theft, you know  crimes with victims.  When cops are ticketing people for not wearing seat belts or for not riding with bike lights then you have too many cops.  You have too many cops, Davis does  that is the point.  You shouldnt have so many so that they can call 4 squad cars for a jaywalker... that sounds rather um ... extreme. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie
       Or we can think of it as preventative measures, designed to stop accidents before they occur.  Users/ElleWeber

20071015 18:45:59 nbsp Its really annoying to get a ticket on my EXTREMELY visable orange fish, with multiple multi colored blinking lights, just because I dont have a white light on the front of my bike. Now I have to bike to woodland to contest it in court. I should also add that I since bought a guppy white light at B&L Bike Shop for $10 which does quite nicely on the angler on my fish. Users/PxlAted

20071015 23:30:11 nbsp Tercero residents felt the wrath of the bike sting on noon in Spring 07 when they were stationed at the intersection outside Sci Lec. So many tickets were issued, I just stood by and watched them yell at 95% of the bicyclists. Users/RobertSooHoo

20071021 15:09:18 nbsp Ticketing bicyclists who violate the rules of the road is a good idea, even if getting a ticket is no fun.

Theres that Critical Mass saying Were not blocking traffic, we ARE traffic.  If were traffic, which legally we are, we have to bike responsibly.  Predictable bicycling makes for fewer accidents, and bicyclists who dont stop at stop signs arent being predictable.  As an added bonus, predictable bicyclists dont incite road rage in people in cars.

Most bicycle accidents happen at night, bicycles are pretty much invisible without lights.   Users/Angel.York

20071023 08:19:32 nbsp I have had to slam on my brakes from bicyclists who make left turns from the right side bike lane, no look or signal.  On Lillard Drive I regularly have bikes that speed across the intersection, while on the sidewalk coming from an area where you cant see them through the trees.  Ive almost been hit on sidewalks numerous times, especially on fifth.  Davis has LOTS of cyclists, and most are well behaved, but there are more than enough to cause major problems.  There needs to be more bike stings to get these hazards off the roads and SIDEWALKS. Users/BradOrahood

20071105 09:02:47 nbsp I actually wish there were more bike stings in town, especially at places like 3rd and A. That intersection has a stop sign for bikes too (not just for cars) and I have seen more cyclists than I can count almost flattened at that intersection when a car that had patiently waited its turn started driving again, only to almost hit a cyclist who rudely burned through their own stop sign and rode out into the street right in front of the car. Add the many cyclists who ride 2 or even 3 abreast and stick out into the street, the ones who ride in the street instead of on an adjacent dedicated bike path (like on Russel), and countless other rude cyclists and I am pretty amazed that there is not more road rage out there against cyclists. I say all this as someone who bikes, walks, and drives around town but who tries, sadly unlike most cyclists and many pedestrians I see, to obey the law and show as much consideration to others on the road as I want them to show to me. Too many cyclists think they are above the law and dont have to follow any of the rules of the road or even common courtesy. Users/ToNils

20071107 10:59:10 nbsp No offense, but I have NEVER seen a police office actually STOP a crime. Like it or not, the police are there to pick up the pieces. I do agree with you that if the police have time to set up a jaywalking sting with four squad cars, they have enough time to be out solving real crimes. As you probably figured out, the number of police doesnt usually correspond to a reduction in crime.

PS: In the picture at the top of the page, isnt the squad car parked illegally? Citizen ticket, anyone? Users/ChristopherNalty

20071107 20:42:22 nbsp WATCH OUT FOR THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE LIFE SCIENCES BUILDING AND SOUTH PARKING STRUCTURES. I work in the Life Sciences building and see people get stopped all the time so watch out and make sure to STOP!!!! Users/Rbbie2x

20080613 09:28:56 nbsp Hey I just visited Davis for my first day —three months before I move here for UCD— and I gotta say this doesnt seem like the kind of town where rampant murder and violent crime goes woefully unchecked because cops are out giving bike tickets. Thats a nonstarter of an argument.

Secondly, I had heard about the respect the cyclist gets paid, and from visiting other US cities that show like 10% of that kind of respect, I felt obligated to give respect back... by following the rules in place, not flying through stop signs, or cutting rapid lefts from the rightside bike lane, etc... Its like: with all the lanes and signals and driver courtesy, I am given this great gift, as a cyclist, and I just dont want to FK it up, ya dig?

Finally, there are way too many cities (like Oakland where I live now) that would ...er... kill to have this big surplus of cops around with nothing better to do. Consider it a blessing. When you get mugged or your windshield is smashed, or god forbid something worse, youll be happy to have so many of the guys and gals in uniform around and available when you need their help. Other than that, just follow them rules, and you wont find yourself crying bloody murder. Thats my plan of attack.

20080619 23:08:21 nbsp My house has been broken into, my car vandalized, and two of my friends cars have been broken into in the last year and the boys in blue havent done st about it. However, they have pulled over every one of my friends at one point to make sure that they werent drinking (no probable cause) and they do have far too many of them here which leads to Bike Stings.  Users/William.Peacock

20110405 10:38:50 nbsp Watch out on Sycamore and 8th. No Tolerance is apparently in effect today, and my buddy and I both got cited for blowing the stop sign. To be fair, we didnt even slow down, so not much room for lamentation (except against general bad luck). Users/Swilltopower

20111203 22:42:35 nbsp I agree. Sycamore Lane & 8th Street is no tolerance. Make sure to stop for at least 2 seconds just to be safe. I think the ticket increased. I got cited for $199.00.  Users/Huck22

20120222 17:10:17 nbsp Not exactly a bike trap, but today around 3PM there was an officer parked in the bike path on Orchard Rd. by the ARC announcing via loudspeaker that cyclists must dismount and walk across the intersection or be subject to a $100 fine. In my 5+ years taking that route, I have never seen an officer concerned about cyclists riding in the crosswalk before. Users/JonathanLawton
  She yelled at me too. Doesnt make any sense, since that crosswalk connects two parts of a bike path. Bet her brain would explode if she was there in the morning when students are trying to get to class, since every rational human being stays on their bike when crossing an intersection. Megan
   I think shes technically right.  Vehicles are not supposed to be in crosswalks.  cp
    Since its an extension of the bike path instead of a regular sidewalk, I wouldnt necessarily view it as a typical cross walk. M
   I agree with both of you.  My inclination is that the officer was technically right, although I havent been able to find anything in the CVC, Davis Municipal Code, or TAPS rules of the road, that explicitly address this.  So, Ive contacted the TAPS Bicycle Program Coordinator to hopefully start to get clarification on the legality of bikes in crosswalks on the UCD Campus.
  Even if riding in crosswalks is technically illegal, though, I agree that it would be absurd to enforce that here.  The crosswalk is physically part of the bike path, the majority of the traffic through the crosswalk is almost certainly cyclists, and, to my knowledge, the crosswalk isnt an accident hot spot.  If UCDPD decides to ban riding here, I imagine theyd have to have an officer stationed there permanently.  Most cyclists (unfortunately) dont even stop for stop signs.  Nobody is going to stop, dismount, and walk across the street unless they are actively being threatened with a fine.  At the very least, it seems like something like this ought to be the lowest enforcement priority. Users/JonathanLawton

20120223 09:28:33 nbsp The Bicycle Program Coordinator at TAPS believes the police are wrong.  Apparently, this same situation occurred a few weeks ago at La Rue and Hutchison, and the police ignored his inquiries.  If they dont respond again, he will meet with them to straighten this out.  He cites CVC 21650(g): This section does not prohibit the operation of bicycles on any shoulder of a highway, on any sidewalk, on any bicycle path within a highway, or along any crosswalk or bicycle path crossing, where the operation is not otherwise prohibited by this code or local ordinance.
