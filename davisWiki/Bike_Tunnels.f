A large number of bike and pedestrian tunnels have been incorporated into the Write The Bike Plan Davis Bike Plan to provide safe and efficient routes for bicyclists.  Many bike tunnels are located along the Greenbelts Greenbelt and include beautiful landscaping, adding to the bikefriendly character of Davis.  You can cruise leisurely through our bike tunnels or ride no hands and scream like a little school girl; either way, you will appreciate their sweet, sweet bicycle coolness.  Some of the tunnels are on the tunnels on campus UCD campus.

 Richards Boulevard Bike Tunnel 
The Richards Underpass Richards Boulevard Bike Tunnel is an older bike tunnel in Davis, running next to Richards Boulevard Richards Blvd under the railroad tracks on the side towards the Davis Commons.  In combination with the RichardsI80 overpass, it was formerly the only route connecting South Davis and Downtown.  Then the Pole Line Bridge was built.  Many people considered the overpass dangerous, however, spurring the addition of the Putah Creek Bicycle Undercrossing in 2000.  With more bike traffic now diverted through the undercrossing, the Richards Bike Tunnel primarily serves the Olive Drive area.

A murals mural entitled Color Study for Cyclists was painted in the tunnel in October 2012.

   According to Users/JoshFernandez, back in the early nineties all the Davis teenagers used to call this the butthole. Users/RobRoy

 The La Rue Road Tunnel 
The La Rue Road tunnel sits just south of Russell Boulevard, next to Segundo.  It provides a safe, continuous bike inlet for students riding to campus from the areas around the University Mall and West Davis.  It is wider than most tunnels in Davis, accommodating large flows of students.

 The Putah Creek Bicycle Undercrossing 
These are a pair of bikeonly tunnels along the South Davis Bike Path that connect South Davis and Downtown.  The set includes an underpass below the Interstate 80 I80 freeway and small tunnel beneath the Train Tracks Union Pacific railroad.  They are located at the east end of the arboretum UC Davis arboretum, just south of the the Davis Commons, and connect to Olive Drive, and Research Park Drive via West Chiles Rd. The Davis Bike Loop includes this undercrossing.

 The Olson Hall/Shields Library Pedestrian Bridge 
This is not exactly a tunnel but is still notable. This bridge connects Olson Hall and Shields Library on the Campus UCD campus. While not a direct route for much walking, it has lots of shaded benches which makes it a great Study Spots study spot. Constructed of redwood, the bridge was built because prior to the construction of Shields west wing, the library entrance was directly opposite Olson. The bridge allowed pedestrians to cross and bikes to traverse without complications. An underpass was dug for bike traffic, and the bridge was put in place. While no longer frequently used by pedestrians, the bridge is now rumored to be the home of Users/BarnabasTruman the friendly ogre. Be careful when you pass byrumor has it that he eats a freshman each year.

 Covell Boulevard Bicycle and Pedestrian Undercrossing 
  A new tunnel is currently being constructed under Covell Boulevard between Monarch Lane and Alhambra Drive, connecting the Mace Ranch greenbelt with the Wildhorse Agricultural Buffer to the north.  City of Davis http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/cip/cip.cfm?cipD4E34F5521FA49D28E4D9D5307D71B87 Capital Improvement Project 8121 may have more info.  The first known bicyclists to ride through the tunnel did so on Sept 20, 2008, after the Lunar Eclipse.  They christened the ceiling with bicycle wine, rang their bells, and whooted and hollered to celebrate the advent of a safe passage to the Wildhorse Greenbelt.

The bridge/tunnel was already planned in 1971, but Wildhorse residents were concerned that the city wasnt going to get it built very quickly.  They were correct to be concerned  it took 37 years.  Thats a lot of kids that had to cross Covell Blvd on their bikes if they wanted to bike to school.

 The H St. Bike Tunnel 
This tunnel goes under the Train Tracks train tracks between H and J. A short bike path connects J street (through the J Street Apartments) to H street. The J street side of the tunnel is accessed by a bike path that starts just north of Drexel and winds through the apartment complex. The H street side is about a block or so south of the Covell train overpass. Best way to get across the tracks if you need to get to campus and a train is blocking your path.  Be sure not to tool through this tunnel as you head west as the path makes an abrupt 90Â° turn at the exit of the tunnel.  Happily part of the Davis Bike Loop.

 Ancient Shadows 
This pedestrian and bike tunnel joins the Pole Line Road bike path to Playfields Park in South Davis, just south of the Pole Line Road overpass and Interstate 80 I80.

 The East Playfields Park bike tunnel 
In addition to the Ancient Shadows tunnel, Playfields Park, a second tunnel to the east joins to the Rose Creek greenbelt below Cowell Boulevard Cowell Blvd.

 The Walnut Park bike tunnel 
This tunnel sits on the north end of Walnut Park in South Davis along the Rose Creek greenbelt.

 The Tercero bike tunnel 
This tunnel connects bike paths between the Tercero Residence Halls and Aggie Stadium along La Rue Road on campus.  The east portal feeds through the Dairy where you can see cows.

 The Loyola bike tunnel 
This East Davis bike tunnel is located on the west end of Mace Ranch Park.  It was built in 1992 as part of Mace Ranch.

 The Anderson Road/Covell Greenbelt bike tunnel 
This North Davis bike tunnel passes the Covell Greenbelt below Anderson Road.

 The Arthur Street bike tunnel 
This West Davis bike tunnel crosses below Arthur Street just south of Hampton Drive.  It connects Arroyo Park and with a path to the Highway 113 overpass.  It was built in 1998 and is part of the Davis Bike Loop.

 The Willowcreek Park bike tunnel 
This tunnel connects the short bike path that runs north of Mono Pl. with Willowcreek Park. While it serves as a safe way to cross under Ohlone St., it also is a great bypass for those who would rather avoid street riding along Cowell Blvd. between Drummond and Ohlone (providing you cut across the barren field where Albany Ave. intersects Drummond).

 The Drummond Avenue bike tunnel 

Help!  Needs picture and description.  http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/city/twodecadeslatercityopensdrummondbiketunnel/ This article might help a bit.

 The Explorit Science Center Explorit/Dave Pelz Bike Overpass D.P. Overpass 5th Street Bike Tunnel 
This tunnel connects the bike path next to Explorit Science Center Explorit to the Dave Pelz Bike Overpass by tunneling under 5th street.

Watch out for the J St. bike tunnel. If youve been partaking of some libations and have forgotten your light, an extremely sharp 90 degree left or right turn is right on the other side of the tunnel, with a convenient wall in the way. A word to the wise: do not haul ass through the tunnel.

20070909 20:03:10 nbsp When entering or exiting the PCB tunnel going to or from the Borders area, its a good idea to ring your bell or honk your horn if youve got it. Theres a blind turn immediately outside of the southern end, and enough people try to pass while inside the tunnel and dont see the northbound bike traffic. Another solution, of course, is to not pass while in the tunnel (or on the Scurve if travelling north); theres plenty of room (and visibility) once youre past the curve. Users/KevinChin
 just noting that, some months ago, the bushes on either side of the path exiting south were trimmed, thus allowing one to see oncoming traffic. Id still watch out for people trying to pass while in the tunnel, however. kc

20080606 13:34:56 nbsp I think the date on the new covell tunnel is incorrect.....since the tunnel is open, and its not September yet.... Users/RocksandDirt

20130924 23:12:14 nbsp I can think of at least one person (myself), that could really benefit from a bike tunnel that circumvents the Mace Blvd bridge. It does seem like a difficult task, though, to tunnel under the highway and the train tracks, and perhaps even 2nd street and that curious little path between the tracks and 80. Users/TheShah

20140710 16:34:49 nbsp I rode through all the tunnels above already...man Ive been in this town for too long. Theyre fun for riding around sometime, though I never ride through some of those small ones at night time, even with my super riding speed(too dark^_^)who knows what leeks in the shadow, muhahahaha Users/Cyclonus
