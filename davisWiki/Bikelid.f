 Near Memorial Union 


 Near the Silo 



These were the two installations that I was familiar with. So I went by and took pictures. The riveted on plastic instructions did not fair well in the sun. Installing the pods over decomposed granite yields splash up during rain; this combines with pine tree sap and dust by the Memorial Union. Anyone with arachnophobia might not want to open the pods? I wonder if for the same cost it would be possible to design a rain and shade cover that would shield an entire row of traditional bike racks? If you like I can get some comparison photos of the dual bike box lockers that they have on the bike path just east of the ARC. I hope this sheds a little more light on the situation.
