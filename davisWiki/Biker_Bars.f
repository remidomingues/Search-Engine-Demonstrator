A biker bar is traditionally a place where tough guys who ride motorcycles hang out.  G Street Pub used to be a biker bar once upon a time.  Plainfield Station is essentially a biker bar. The Club no longer exists, but serves as another example of a Davis watering hole that was a bit like a biker bar.
