WTF (Women/Trans/Friends):  This workshop basically exists to address the fact that, hey, mechanics is dominated by men.  And that being whatever it is, sometimes, the less macho among us need a little fresh air.  We need to feel comfy being feminine, genderneutral or otherwise notquiteso dudely, and STILL be wrenching.  Its no jab to guysits just that sometimes, you need to band together when youre the minority.  Its just relieving.  So this is supposed to give a legup to whomever may feel less inclined to come to the shop during open hours due to the doubleobstacle of a) not knowing how to do it yourself and b) being one of the few nondudes in the shop.  At least we can knock a) out of the way so you can barrell through b) like it was nothing at all you empowered and skillful person, you.

This used to be a womenonly space, but with some time, thought and dialogue it became apparent that this thing is about the interface: its got to be a twosided plan in order to benefit us.  So this quarter were going to focus on the interface: how can we make the spankin new bike collective as conducive to equalopportunity wrenching as possible?  Its about getting all of us to respect different styles, approaches and sensitivities to create an environment where were all still psyched to rock the bike at the end of the day.

 The Goal: to make wrenching more accessible to the female, trans, and genderqueer people of Davis and surrounding areas, and to create a time and space within The Davis Bike Collective that is a righteous, genderconscious zone.

 The Hope: That nondudes will feel more encouraged to join the congregation (and the ministry!!!), get greasy, and get their hands on their own bikes/lives!

The Lowdown:  This time its going to be a course that will assist in your efforts to strip down your bike, piece by piece, stare at its bloody guts, reassemble that sucker and get it rolling like you never knew it could.  You can come to any and all sessions you want to, and if youve been to one before it will be highly recommendable that you come back and help teach yet more people how to do this: youll soon be an expert in bikemechanics as well as gender relations and the creation of a safe space.  Booyah.  There will likely also be copious amounts of hanging out, punk rock, literatureproducing and patriarchycrushing.  Watch out.

The Name: So maybe Bikes Are For Bitches fails to draw a certain crowd or fails to draw anything but a certain crowd?  So weve changed the name to WTF, a name which came from the San Francisco Bike Kitchen.  It addresses both the idea of drawing Women, Transgender and Friends (used to be femme but this seems more inclusive) as well as the confusing and complex role of gender in progressive grassroots organizations like this one.  But, the wiki page still deserves tribute to Bikes are for Bitches with the following exerpt from the old wiki page:
Women Trans Friends (WTF) bicycle repair workshops have moved to Sunday 46 p.m. at Bike Forth, located at the corner of 4th and L Street in Davis. WTF is a genderpositive space where you can share your experiences in the bicycling world and learn how to fix your bike.

Schedule of 2012 workshops:

13 Oct: Wheels
27 Oct: Brakes
10 Nov: Bottom bracket, cranks, and pedals
24 Nov: Derailleur, chains, and shifters

Though weâ€™ll do something different each week, you can stick around after WTF hours for Open Shop hours to practice and learn other new things with whoever is running Open Shop.  WTF is a project of the Davis Bike Collective, a doityourself bike repair collective that runs Bike Forth.
