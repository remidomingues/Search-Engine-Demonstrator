The Biking Oxen is a weekly mobile market that strolls through your neighborhood at scheduled times selling fresh vegetables and other local artisanal foods.

We hope that some day, our cart will be drawn faithfully by Peter Pan, our local ox celebrity, trained by Mark. In the meantime, our carts are Bicycles bicycle drawn, powered by humans to bring you goods of your choice. The market will be announced by traditional music of the highland bagpipes.
