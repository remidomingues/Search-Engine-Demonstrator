There was a vandalism early Thursday March 24, 2011.  It was reported in the http://digital.davisenterprise.com/news/yogastudiovandalizedpoliceseektips/ Davis Enterprise. Apparently, this vandal does not read the wiki or he would have known there is almost always a man inside the premises.


20061026 19:37:40 nbsp Erin was a member of the Grand Champion Davis High School Jazz Choir Users/AdamFlowers

20080202 12:57:40 nbsp Bikram Yoga ROCKS. I have also heard from outoftown dropins that Erins studio is the cleanest they have seen.  Users/G.L.

20080502 12:19:31 nbsp All the instructors are great.  Its a tough workout, but youll feel great afterwards.  Its so detoxifying. Users/bodhicatva

20080805 18:18:24 nbsp Hey everybody: Erins a great healer offering a global soul. I was fortunate to feel the heal in Istanbul, Jerusalem, Mainz, and, of course, Bikram class. Expect mental and spiritual results as well as physical ones.        Users/onnaca

20080805 19:00:48 nbsp Everyone I talk to seems to go nuts over Bikram, I have a couple sprains on various appendages from a year ago that numerous friends who dont know each other have recommended it to me. It also apparently puts you in a very zenlike mental state after your used to it... Users/StevenDaubert

20080816 14:38:31 nbsp This is the best yoga studio in Davis. Erin is fantastic and all the other teachers rock as well. I love the decor and it is always immaculate in the studio. You will not find a better workout anywhere. Her prices are very reasonable. I love this studio, the teachers and what Bikram has done for my life! Thanks Erin! Users/jwendt

20081119 20:26:01 nbsp I love love love it here... Bikram is not for the faint of heart but this is an excellent Bikram studio, IMO.  Their prices are also pretty amazing, well worth it.  Once in a while if its a smaller group with a little experience the teachers do a silent class, which can be fun.  My one complaint is that I wish they would have a fixed schedule and write the names of the yoga teachers, as I really do prefer some and really would like to avoid one. Users/soledad101

20081120 11:47:41 nbsp Having just done my first class yesterday, I can safely say that Bikram is everything I deplore about stretching made more complicated/intense and done in a super hot room with strict (but loving) instructors. I will be back, for sure! Users/StevenDaubert

20081120 11:57:52 nbsp $20 for ten consecutive days?!  What a bargain.  Im starting for sure. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090318 15:07:54 nbsp I tried Bikram yoga for the first time. I heard great things about it, but people warned me it would be tough. I tried it and I loved the way it made me feel after. It was REALLY hard the first time, but I promise you after your 2nd3rd time you will start appreciating the feeling!The instructors are awesome they will call you by name!The only thing is...Im not a student so its a little pricey for me to pay $125 every month. I wish I was a student because I would be able to pay $85/month. But Oh well some things are worth paying for! Users/genesisDR

20090605 00:24:06 nbsp Hey, all you overweight, outofshape 50somethings, if I can do it, so can you! I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, among other physical challenges. My son, daughter and soninlaw were regulars so I finally gave it a try. To my surprise (and secret delight), EVERYONE is struggling, even the skinnies. But we are all smiling at the end. My aching back is getting so much better that I really notice it if a miss a week. Today I touched my toes for the first time! Erin and the teachers are very supportive and everyone roots for everyone else. The intro price of $20 for 10 consecutive days gives you a chance to see if its for you without a big investment. Say hi to me when you show up!   Users/LaurieLoving

20091221 13:24:46 nbsp Soledad101 who was the instructor you try to avoid.  I went for my first time a few days ago and felt like the class was more boot camp like which makes me not want to go back.  Wish they had the names of the instructors and when each on is teaching.  All of them probably have different styles. Users/CW

20100122 21:45:49 nbsp I tried Bikram out after first reading about it here, and now I love it! Im on my 10th class or so and let me tell you it is a workout like no other. It was SO PAINFUL when I first started, but Im getting the hang of it. And although Im usually the ittybitty undergrad in a roomfull of mature adults, I always feel so welcome here. Erin is incredibly nice! Worth every dollar...   Users/Mellerz
  How was your first couple times in the first part of tree? Do you drop your kneecap really low while having your heel high? How was your first couple times in spine strengthening when you lift both legs? Do you have your pinkies touching when you do so now?  Users/StevenDaubert

20100205 18:35:47 nbsp I like the bootcamp style of the studio.  The instructor remembered my name, which was awesome, and I liked the feeling of being pushed to my limit.  Its an incredible mental and physical exercise and I felt amazing afterwards.  HOWEVER, the room smells disgusting.  I realize that people are sweating all over the place, but I do wonder how often they shampoo the carpet. Users/blacksofa

20100617 15:46:45 nbsp Bikram Yoga has been a great experience for me! I noticed almost immediate differences in my body. All the instructors are kind and knowledgeable. Carolyn is far and away my favorite instructor, with her soft but powerful dialogue, and total commitment to each and every student in her class. Love her! All the instructors are good and I dont mean to be harsh but instead provide a little feedback... Elizabeth tends to get preoccupied with one student during a pose, which is great for that student, but isnt for the rest of us. She often times allows everyone else to stay in the pose for two, sometimes THREE times as long as they should (yes, Ive counted), while she is focused in on just one student. This has happened every time I have attended Elizabeths classes and now for this reason, I try to avoid them. I love Bikram for the consistency and predictability of the routine, and unfortunately, Elizabeths class tends to waver too much in that respect.        Users/lovinglife

20110116 22:01:13 nbsp The instructors were good and I got a great workout but I found the place to be very dirty so I dont plan on returning. They really, really need to replace the carpet with hardwood floors or some other material that can be cleaned regularly because the hot room is disgusting. They also need to provide locker rooms for men and women to change and shower, separately. This yoga studio has potential because the people are great but the facility needs some work. Users/NMgal

20110313 22:47:42 nbsp I used to be very active but have been unable to play tennis, etc for over a year due to chronic neck/head pain. Bikram has helped me to start moving again and tone up my muscles. There are a couple positions that involve the neck that I am unable to do but everything else feels great. The instructors are motivating and thoughtful.  I definitely would recommend Bikram to anyone especially people who have an injury or chronic pain.  Users/KatherineL

20110314 01:17:09 nbsp I adore this place.  I have been practicing now for about a year though I am sad to say most of it was sporadic.  Lately though Ive been going regularly and the benefits of Bikram are fabulous.  All the instructors have different personalities and while Erin can seem intimidating at first she really is a wonderful and encouraging influence.  I noticed some complaints about cleanliness or smell but it always seems clean and the smell has never bothered me.  Theres no privacy issues Ive ever experienced and yeah, its going to smell sweaty when a room is kept that hot and used that frequently.  Once you start in on your practice you completely forget that and spend all your energy focusing on postures.  If the building or room smelled sickly I would be concerned but theres a difference between sweaty body odor and mold; theres absolutely 0 trace of the latter. Users/OliviaY

20110314 12:47:56 nbsp I live right down the street from this establishment and, while I have never been a patron, notice very shady things at night/early morning on my after work visits to 711. There is a longhaired gentleman who can be found with various other people inside the building playing guitar, dancing, and, on occasion, smoking marijuana or what smells like it. If he is the maintenance man, he should not be inviting others into an establishment he is there to clean. If he is the owner, he should know this is not a proper use of the facilities but may do what he wishes.  Just seems fishy to me. Users/WesP
  I love this place.  Really sad to hear something bad happened to it.  Users/OliviaY
  WesP  Sounds like the longhaired gentleman and his friends are being pretty obvious about their shenanigans. Does he leave the door open, when you come walking by? Do the various smells drift down the sidewalk out through the open door? Users/NickCarraway

20110602 16:20:03 nbsp Excellent workout. Its really hard at first, but keep going, and it gets easier, with great results. All the teachers are greattheyll help you with the poses and address you by name. I have knee problems, but the poses really help build knee strength and stability. Great people, great workout, and great results.   Users/AmandaC

20110609 18:55:54 nbsp great first time there. felt like i might have been done for like half way through but the instructor really knows how to rally her troops gently but firmly if they look like theyre about to go down! lol Users/JohannaGriffin

20110610 23:35:44 nbsp Just outstanding. The teachers care. You can reshape your body and heal yourself. With time, patience and breathing you will improve. I  heartily encourage anyone, especially if you are inflexible or working on your weight to consider Bikram.  Users/Gourmand

20110623 21:28:47 nbsp From these comments, Erin and Carolyn sound great. When do they teach?

Also, I wasnt aware that Bikram wasnt like other forms of yoga (where things are switched up and you dont do the same moves every time). Has anyone found this to be repetitive/get boring after time? Getting used to the heat is a challenge, but once you do, does it get tedious? (feels awesome afterwards though).

Additionally, I know in other yoga classes Ive taken, instructors are all about protecting your body, hydrating whenever you feel like you need to, basically creating your own practice. But this is the first class Ive taken where Ive been asked to push my joints and spine into some strange positions or asked to wait for water breaks... (like tilting your head all the way back and crunching the cervical vertebrae or some moves that feel a little unsafe for the knees) Its not like the instructor was pushing everyone to go crazy, but I guess Im just used to yoga instructors being very concerned with keeping the body safe (maybe the heat makes these poses safer??).

Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone else felt this way about this form... (Ive only had one instructor so far so it might also be an instructor preference thing...) Users/ttl

 For me its never boring because you can push the stretch and get more into pose, and you can try and clear the mind so its truly opened eyed meditation yadda yadda. After you have been stretching for a long time in the hot room the last post is the big spine twist... Also the spine series comes 3/4 the way thru class iirc (been a while) and you are nice and limber. Its not easy yoga... Another one that is pretty unintuitive but feels glorious is when you have to lay on the elbow joint and lift legs... Daubert

  Hi Erin, I just left you a message on your user page, which is Users/erindunning here.  In short, youre not hacking... youre a wiki editor now.  Welcome! Users/CovertProfessor

20111004 13:11:18 nbsp On this first cool fall day I decided to check the Bikram Yogan schedule because its been awhile since Ive visited.  So I looked at the new comments to see if much has changed.  Thankfully  no.  The instructors whose names I recognize are still there (yeah, Carolyn, Erin & Jesse) and of course the sequence stays the same.  Its an intense workout for this aging body but after each class I am so grateful I participated.  Cant wait to get back to the hot room & start feeling better.  Users/SusyArriaga

20111004 22:43:13 nbsp I love this studio!  Erin does an amazing job of running the place.  The facility is always clean and welcoming.  She and the other instructors are awesome.  This is by far the best yoga studio in Davis and the best Bikram studio in northern California. I have several friends who drive in from out of town to take classes here.  The workout is challenging but incredibly rewarding.  Did I mention how much I love this place?      Users/asutton

20111005 13:33:17 nbsp Azi, glad u are feeling the yoga Love! Users/erindunning

20111218 20:17:12 nbsp Bikram Yoga is intense! Ive only been to 6:00am classes. I like how the class sizes are small during this time. Ive had Carolyn and Jesse, both are good. Its smelly in the hot room and it gets more noticeable during the floor poses. I love how much I sweat. The introductory deal is great! I recommend everyone to try it at least once.  Users/VKC

20131027 16:37:21 nbsp Be forewarned: Bikram yoga is an intense workout. Its easy to become dehydrated, especially after a class. A few pros: the instructors are incredibly supportive and try their best to remember all of the students names. They also checkin frequently to be sure that youre feeling okay, especially if youre sitting down and looking a little peaky. Cons: the studio smells like mold & mildew. Also, the instructors advise you to only drink water at specific water break times (because it is distracting to the rest of the class). This seems a little strange to me, especially because everyone is sweating buckets and limiting your water intake seems like a potential safety issue. Users/TeaBird
