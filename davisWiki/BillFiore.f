I Am Proverbial Bill

Bill Hates the Wiki Users/JohnDudek

Ah yes... it is a strange and horrible story of how I came to be Proverbial Bill, starting with the inevitable meeting of the one known as Pagel Bagel and ending with the tragically simple yet utterly mindblowing question How can I be a vaginal blast of air BILL. This of course was followed by his ultimate low moment, a few months later, which would live in infamy, when he mustured the courage to fight back by verbaly bashing his opponent into submission with the quick wit of a good comeback ...Oh ya...well why dont you go have sex with something...?

I decided to make this because a couple of friends (Crap Duvet) did and it looked fun. Fun like plotting something in a top hat, or fun like a danceing cat, maybe not quite as fun as driving a busted up car in black and white with cuts and other injuries though.

And now for something Completely different...
Also also wik

I dont really know what this has to do with anything but it is Competely different. And if you think thats normal tobacco hes smoking, think again, just look at those eyes.

Like Crap Duvet I do not like others input when it comes to things that dont concern them (such as my life or anything related to me) and complaining or criticizing may lead to further unpleasantries. As for anyone who feels it is their business to look through this page, dont its that simple, if you disagree go screw yourself, you realy dont have to bring me down with you.


Reasons to hate france

 1. Q. Why did the French plant trees along the Champs Elysees?
    A.So the Germans could march in the shade.
 2. Q: How many gears does a French tank have?
    A: 4 reverse and 1 forward, in case the enemy attacks from the rear.
 3. Q: How can you identify a French Infantryman?
    A: Sunburned armpits.
 4. Q. What do you call 100,000 Frenchmen with their hands up?
    A. The Army.
 5. I would rather have a German division in front of me than a French one behind me. General George S. Patton
 6.Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion. Norman Schwartzkopf
 7.We can stand here like the French, or we can do something about it. Marge Simpson
 8.As far as Im concerned, war always means failure. Jacques Chirac, President of France
 9.As far as France is concerned, youre right. Rush Limbaugh
 10.The last time the French asked for more proof, it came marching into Paris under a German flag. David Letterman
 11.An old saying: Raise your right hand if you like the French.... Raise both hands if you are French.
 12. Q: What is the most useful thing in the French Army?
     A: A rearview mirror, so they can see the war.
 13. french war record
Hundred Years War: Mostly lost, saved at last by a female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of    French Warfare  Frances armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchmen.

American Revolution: In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as de Gaulle Syndrome, and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare: France only wins when America does most of the fighting

French Revolution: Won, primarily due to the fact that the opponent was also French.

The Napoleonic Wars: Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.

WWI: Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States. Thousands of French women find out what its like not only to sleep with a winner, but one who doesnt call her Fraulein. Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline.

 Well thats all for now but heres somthing to satisfy any leftover urges.
