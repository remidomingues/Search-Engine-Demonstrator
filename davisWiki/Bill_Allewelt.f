Bill Allewelt (class of 1950) was the editor of the California Aggie during the 19461947 academic year, after World War II.  As part of the influx of GI students during postwar period, he fell into the position when the first person chosen for the position did not return to school in fall.

Working with West Hall activism activists, he was part of the student effort to rebuild the neglected campus infrastructure after school resumed.  He received a letter from the UC System UC top lobbyist that informed him that (paraphrased in his words) such shenanigans would bring him to no good end.
