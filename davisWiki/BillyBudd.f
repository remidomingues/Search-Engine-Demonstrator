20070526 09:37:33 nbsp Im wondering two things. One, rather than assuming that BillyBudd must be a pseudonym Im going to ask if it is. Is BillyBudd your real name? Two, if you would be taking more care with your comments if you were posting under your real name? One of the not too closely followed ideas floating around the wiki is the Importance of using your RealName. Users/JasonAller

20070526 10:35:13 nbsp Perhaps you should read up on the traffic law. Shouting stuff like two wheels good, four wheels bad is not harassment and is not illegal. Also, using lanes when necessary (such as when other lanes are crowded is actually something that the CVC says bikes have a right to do. The only traffic law that Davis Critical Mass routinely breaks is disobeying stop signs and lights, albeit in a manner that is never unsafe and makes traffic move more quickly. When the group goes through a stop light and the light changes, the group continues through the intersection. Its not like theyre darting out into the intersection on a red and endangering anyone. As for stop signs, the group stops and lets people go, then goes through the stop sign. The group never darts through an intersection when the front does not have the right of way. In summary, Critical Mass obeys the law to the extent that it makes sense in a mass bike ride. Users/WilliamLewis

20080518 11:43:37 nbsp Its okay... add your take on it too.  Wiki entries are written by many people putting in their takes on various subjects and respecting the views of others.  Go ahead and add your take rather than just cutting out a rather witty little writeup that somebody else crafted. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
