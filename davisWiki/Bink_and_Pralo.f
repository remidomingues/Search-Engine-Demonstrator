Bink and Pralo, some of the fine wiki animals, were once known as Arnold and Marie, with the female being Arnold and the male being Marie.  Yes, they were very confused, but still managed to get along quite well.  They were given a nest box and after a few weeks and many cloacal kisses, four eggs popped out.  Bink sits on the eggs most of the time while Pralo hangs out and restaurants eats.  Occasionally though, Bink needs a break and Pralo takes over.  Will they be successful parents?  Well know within a few weeks!
