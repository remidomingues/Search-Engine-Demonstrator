 In Yolo County 

There are a number of biodiesel vehicles in Davis, some of whom are generating their own biodiesel from waste oil theyve collected. Users/BenjaminMiller reported smelling some tractors using biodiesel down by the Bowley Center.  There are also http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/05/12/Features/Driving1317492.shtml?norewrite200607290332&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com confirmed biodiesel tractors on campus.

 Past efforts 
Initial results from the 2007 Davis biodiesel survey are here: Biodiesel Survey Preliminary Results! Biodiesel was coming to the Arco station on Mace, hopefully by summer 2008... but did not. A Davis Biodiesel Users Group local users group (DBUG) has ceased to function. There was at least the start of a movement about a year ago to set up a biodiesel station at the Davis Food Coop, but Users/DougWalter (a biodiesel user who works as the Coops Membership Director) responded to the http://groups.google.com/group/davisBUG?lnkgschg Davis Biodiesel Users Group list (see Davis Biodiesel Users Group DBUG) that management was concentrating on store renovation and did not feel the site(s) suggested would work well for shoppers. Seth McOmber, former Marketing Coordinator, was the Food Coops biodiesel liaison.
Local Biodiesel Producers

There are many http://pathtofreedom.com/pathproject/offthegrid/biodiesel.shtml ways to produce your own biodiesel fuel.  No Davis producers have selfidentified (at least not on this wiki).

20070114 15:30:12 nbsp People interested in biodiesel should start calling local farmers. Many farmers have begun refining oil from the restaurants they sell to, and creating biodiesel for their farm equipment. ATTRA/NCAT is a nonprofit group that produces farm manuals and they have several biodiesel manuals.  Their farmer hotline is 8003469140 (English);  8004113222 (Espa√±ol) Users/JoRo

20070822 17:46:40 nbsp I dont have personal knowledge of anyone making biodiesel at home right now. I personally know of two former residents who did. There are many good resources for home brewing on the Internet (as shown by the links on this page). Users/DougWalter
