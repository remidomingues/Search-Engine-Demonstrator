Bioletti runs NorthSouth between Hutchison Drive and La Rue.  There is a gate in the middle, so cars arent able to drive from one end to the other.  This is because of the proximity to the Tercero dorms  University officials decided it would be too risky to have everyone driving down Bioletti without slowing down near the dorms.  Everyone who can get past the gate essentially knows about the large number of Freshmen that cross the street, so having the gate there makes it much safer.

It borders the Academic Surge Buildings, Tercero, Kemper Hall, Meyer Hall and Parking Lot 44.
