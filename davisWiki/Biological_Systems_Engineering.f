Biological Systems Engineering (EBS) is the branch of engineering that builds strongly on biology as a scientific base. In the coming age of biology and biotechnology, engineers will be needed to work side by side with life scientists to bring laboratory developments into commercial production. Industries in plant and animal production, tissue culture, bioprocessing, biotechnology, food processing, aquaculture, agriculture, and forest production will all need engineers with strong training in biology. Concern for our environment is opening new engineering opportunities as society strives to maintain a balance within the biosphere.  The program belongs to the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences within the Biological and Agricultural Engineering Biological and Agricultural Engineering Department.


Undergraduate Program

In the freshman and sophomore years, the Biological Systems Engineering Majors major requires sequences of courses usual in all engineering programs, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering science, and Letters and Science humanities. Unlike other majors, the Biological Systems Engineering major also requires fundamental courses in the biological sciences and the integration of engineering with biology.

In the junior and senior years, the Biological Systems Engineering major requires courses that focus on the integration of biology and physical sciences with engineering. Depending on your area of interest, you may select elective courses from seven specializations: 1) Agricultural Engineering; 2) Aquacultural Engineering; 3)Biomechanics / Premedicine / Preveterinary Medicine; 4) Biotechnical Engineering; 5) Ecological Systems Engineering; 6) Food Engineering; and 7) Forest Engineering. You may also develop your own specialization in consultation with your adviser. The upper division requirements are listed following the areas of specialization. Students in the major can be frequently found pulling allnighters in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering Computer lab in 3026 Bainer.


Graduate Programs (M.S + Ph.D)

Two Masters degrees are available to graduate students in Biological Systems Engineering.  Programs for Master of Science (M.S) emphasize the science or research features of engineering and are intended to provide the student with abilities to assist with furtherance of the fundamental knowledge of engineering.  Programs for the Master of Engineering (M.Eng) emphasize design, analysis, economics, management, and/or labor, and are intended to assist the student with training that is useful to the professional engineer.

Two doctoral degrees are available to graduate students in Biological Systems Engineering.  Programs for the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) emphasize the science or research features of engineering and are intended to provide the student with abilities to assist with furtherance of the fundamental knowledge of engineering.  Doctor of Engineering (D.E.) programs emphasize design, analysis, economics, management, and/or labor, and are intended to assist the student with training useful to the professional engineer.
