The Biological and Agricultural Engineering department at UC Davis is housed on the 2nd floor of Bainer Hall. Most classes offered in this department also take place in Bainer Hall. The department reports to two colleges: the College of Engineering and the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.

The Bio & Ag Engineering department offers one B.S. degree in Biological Systems Engineering (EBS). Students can specialize in Agricultural Engineering, Aquacultural Engineering, Biomechanics/Premedicine/Preveterinary Medicine (formerly Biomedical until the Biomedical Engineering department was formed), Biotechnical Engineering, Ecological Systems Engineering, Food Engineering, or Forest Engineering. There are 184 minimum units required for the major.

You can often find many juniors and seniors majoring in Biological Systems Engineering in one of Bainer Halls computer labs. There is a computer lab on the 1st and 3rd floor of Bainer Hall for EBS students and staff. Access to computer labs is limited only to those in EBS. Some students stay in the computer labs until the middle of the night to finish homework and lab reports.

Several of the early Ag Engineering faculty never held a PhD, reflecting how higher education has changed in the last 60 years. Its unthinkable today to hire a new faculty member without a doctorate, but it was more acceptable in the 1940s and 50s.

 Department Mission Statement 

  The Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering is dedicated to the advancement of engineering for biological systems. Specifically, our goals are to advance the science, teach the principles and application, and disseminate the knowledge of engineering needed to efficiently produce, distribute, and process biological products, such as food, feed, and fiber, while conserving natural resources, preserving environmental quality, and ensuring the health and safety of people.

Biological Systems Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.
