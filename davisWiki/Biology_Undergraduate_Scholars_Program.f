The Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program (BUSP) is a small, grantfunded enrichment program that helps EOP students succeed in science by putting them through workshops for general chemistry and calculus. These are similar to the coclasses offered by the Student Academic Success Center for the general student body (they are taught by the same people, in fact). BUSP students also take a 1unit program seminar every quarter.

BUSP recruits students during STEP, an EOP summer advising program, and is most active during the students first year.

BUSP Honors, a related program, is open to all undergraduate sophomores and juniors in the sciences. To apply, students must find a faculty sponsor and develop a research proposal. BUSP Honors will fund fulltime summer research for a select number of proposals. To find out more, visit the College of Biological Sciences in 202 Life Sciences. The current program director is Connie Champagne.
