Biomedical Engineering advances fundamental medical concepts; creates knowledge from the molecular to the organ systems levels; and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices, and informatics approaches. These approaches are applied to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. The objective is to prepare students for employment in companies that manufacture medical assist devices, human tissue products, and therapeutics. This program also prepares students to enter a graduate program in Biomedical Engineering or pursue professional degrees in medicine and related health fields.
