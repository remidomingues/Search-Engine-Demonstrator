 About the club 

The Biotechnology Club is a student organizations student organization that is designed to provide you answers:
  What is biotechnology?
  What does it mean to have an emphasis in either Animal, Plant, Microbiology and Fermentation, and/or Bioinformatics?
  What does a real Biotechnology company like Novozymes look like?
  What can I get out of this major once I graduate?

They also seek to provide a medium for underclassmen to make an informed decision when choosing an emphasis.

As a club, they can serve as a proxy for upperclassmen to share their knowledge of biotech specific coursework and as a forum among undergraduate researchers.

Biotechnology encapsulates many fields. Whether your career aspirations are in medicine, technology, agriculture, engineering, forensics, organic chemistry, academia, or public policy, the Biotechnology Club is a resource for finding whats out there, and helping you decide what is for you.

During the meetings, they aim to provide information about the Biotechnology major, create networks among students & faculty, discuss the industrys current affairs, and finally, to foster bonds of friendship.

If you have any questions, feel free to email them at their club email.

 Volunteer Events 



UC Davis Biotechnology Expo
The Expo is a volunteer event where apprentice level (67th grade) middle school students sign up for a scientific project topic (such as Agriculture Biotechnology, Genomics, Forensics, Biomedical Engineering, etc), and create a poster detailing the history, the economic impact, and the ethical and social issues of the topic. This event is not only great for educating the middle school students about the scientific topics in society, but helps engage them in topics the students may take part in the future.

The Biotechnology Club helps by setting up the event, helps judge the posters the students bring, and helps to clean up after the event is over.
