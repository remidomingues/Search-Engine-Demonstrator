Birch Lane runs from Pole Line Road to East Covell Boulevard. Pole Line and Covell have their own intersection and Birch Lane connects them to the east of that. Starting at the southern end Clara Lane branches off to the southeast, then Chapman Place and finally as it approaches Covell it crosses Denison Drive. There are speed bumps in front of the school.
