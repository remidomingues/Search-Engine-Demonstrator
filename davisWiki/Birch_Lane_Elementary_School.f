Birch Lane Elementary is both a traditional Schools school as well as a Montessori Public School. It has 7 Montessori classrooms with Montessori and California certified teachers, and is growing every year.  The future growth will be communityinterest driven.  This is a great option for those looking for a Montessori option in the public school district.  It is similar to both the Spanish Immersion program and Fairfield School in that, if you want Montessori, you register for this program specifically at school registration time in March, whether it is your home school or not.

On April 14, 2011, Birch Lane Elementary Davis In The Media made the national news when Teacher Librarian Lynne Sundstrom and her students went on a monthlong campaign to respond to a New York Times article declaring the death of the picture book, culminating in having a http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/opinion/l14scroll.html?_r1&scp1 letter to the editor published in the NYT, along with a note from the editor and a http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/04/14/opinion/20110414lettersscroll.html?refopinion picture of the scroll on which the letter was written.  According to the letter, the students read 4,590 picture books over the course of Love a Picture Book Month.  The Davis Enterprise also ran a http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/overwhelmingresponsetobirchlanessupportforpicturebooks/ story on the NYT letter.
