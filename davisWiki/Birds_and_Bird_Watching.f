Birding or Bird Watching?  Its all the same!
Many residents of Davis enjoy checking out other residents or visitors to town.  Specifically human birders love to scope out the avian population!  While there are many bird species that occur in this area yearround, there are hundreds of others that enjoy Yolo County just for the winter.

This section is to share about birds and birding here in Davis/Yolo County; not to try and recreate the wonderful birding site elsewhere online.  If you have good photos of local birds, please go the relevant page and post them.  If you have stories about encounters with local birds, please add them to The Bird and I page.  Also check out the Friends of West Pond Friends of West Pond pages to see sightings of birds there.

Check out California Duck Days for workshops and birding in the Davis Wetlands wetlands.

 Books: Northern California Birds

 Dead Birds 
West Nile Virus is causing some of the birds in Davis to drop dead. Crow Migration Crow carcasses litter the ground in some parts of Davis. (posted in 2005)
Corvid populations have rebounded somewhat since then.  Magpies are again flocking in south Davis. (as of 2010)

If you see a dead bird, specifically a crow, scrub jay, or magpie, please report it here: http://townsend.ucdavis.edu/reportadeadbird/

20070402 17:41:29 nbsp I have many pics of the cormorants from the Arboretum and also of just about every other feathered species mentioned on the wiki (amateur wildlife photographer with a special interest in birds) except the swifts and owls.  You can see it on my person page.  Perhaps some of these pictures might be useful for birds that have unclear or absent photographs?  Users/CaitlinMorrow
