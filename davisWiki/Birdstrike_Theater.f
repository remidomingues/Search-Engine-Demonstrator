20090531 00:12:58 nbsp Ive attended two of their shows, a big one and a small one. The small shows they put on throughout the quarter are usually free, and feature a smaller cast. The big shows cost $2 or $3 but last about two hours to include sketch comedy, videos, and of course, improv.

The last show I watched was birdstrikeVII, with a freedom them.

IT.WAS.AWESOME.

At the end of the show, it was bittersweet as they said goodbye to a large portion of their cast who were graduating. It will be great to see how the younger ones keep it up! I cant wait until next year, but will definitely miss the older cast members.

If you have a chance to attend a show of theirs, DO IT! It is a very cheap form of entertainment, and youll probably feel happier after attending a show. Users/BrookeB
