20100124 14:12:47 nbsp I left a note for Users/usagigaijin about the comment you removed. If you were editing under your real name my comment to them about their choice of user name would have had more impact. I cant say Im real enthusiastic about their comment being removed, but I felt they deserved a note to let them know that it had occurred even if they are just a disgruntled ebay customer. If you are Dan, stand behind your words as Dan, an individual and member of both the Davis and Wiki Community Davis Wiki communities. Users/JasonAller

20100201 14:34:56 nbsp Real vote? There were two or three votes before that one.  CovertProfessor started one saying yes or no on version 147. I expanded it to four diffent options in a second vote.  WesHardaker came in to make it even more specific: 6 bullet points that were addressed specifically.  His sixth one, about a clean slate/archival, is what you then wanted in your newest vote.  As it is, I think WesHardakers current 6point vote is probably the most fair.  It covers every detail currently being contested as a separate issue, rather than lumping it all together.  Clearly, people voting yes on any of those proposals would be an automatic no on your real vote anyway.  Users/EdWins

20100201 14:47:40 nbsp Why are you readded your real vote?  The poll, as written, includes all of the possible options.  Youre disrupting peoples edits and making it difficult for people to contribute to the discussion. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100201 14:50:32 nbsp Whats more, your poll doesnt work.  Its a compound question, making it impossible to vote meaningfully.  PNs 6 points include all 4 of yours, plus 2 others. Users/TomGarberson

20100202 11:30:02 nbsp How about we go back to my vote? I put it up days before you put yours up. Users/WilliamLewis
