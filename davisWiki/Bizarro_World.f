History

Bizarro World has been in downtown Davis for 17 years in four different locations (the site formerly occupied by Aquarius, the former Big League Sports location, 706 5th Street and now 223 E Street) and under 3 different names (Comics Wizzard, Four Color Comics and finally Bizarro World). Before and after being located on E Street, Bizarro World was located on 706 5th Street. In 2006, Bizarro World opened a second location in Woodland, taking over Woodland Cards and Comics; however this location has since been sold.

Bizarro World moved to the current location in January 2010.  The previous business there, before a two year vacancy, was Bogeys Books.

The new location used to feature the a coinoperated arcade with a number of classic video games. The coinop games were not actually operated by coins. Instead, you paid at the desk for playing time.  Arcade games included Classics 1 (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious, and more), Midway Collection (Defender 1 and 2, Joust, Rampage, Sinistar, and more), Ms. PacMan, NeoGeo Collection (Bust a Move, Metal Slug, 1942, and more), Race Drivin, Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition, Super Monaco GP, Gun Force, a couple of pinball games (Elvira and the Party Monsters, Terminator 3), some table games (air hockey, pool, foosball), and a PlayStation with DDR, Guitar Hero, etc.  In the Spring of 2011, they removed the arcade games, to make way for their video rental location Four Star Rentals.

In the past they were not able to hold sanctioned tournaments (until 2014) with Wizards of the Coasts special prizes because they sold product before its release date to a Users/risky DCI Judge.


 

  Davis has comics and roleplaying games galore, both shops and people who read and play them!



Ive had nothing but good experiences with this place. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050202 12:25:36 nbsp Very friendly staff, they even remember what I like. Users/AmeliaCarlson

20050202 21:53:50 nbsp Not as expansive as other stores (for example, Comic Relief in Berkeley), but I agree: very friendly and helpful. Support independent businesses! Users/CentralDavisite

20050622 17:22:26 nbsp Their dice selection is ample and prices reasonable.  Youre not going to find much rare stuff, but its a good basic RPG supply shop for sure.  Users/BrandonKeene

20050803 18:42:52 nbsp Friendly staff but the folks running the place do seem more interested in Magic and RPGs than comics.  Sometimes it is difficult to pull them away from a game they are playing to ask a question or buy something.  For a comics shop, there is much to be desired, especially in the way of stock and selection (apparently the person that wrote the description above hasnt been to a real comics shop).  Unfortunately they are about the only place to go locally for comics but if you are into RPGs theyve got you covered. Users/HollywoOd

20050929 20:35:51 nbsp I think that for its size, this shop packs a wallop. The staff has always been friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Users/JoseGonzalez

20060217 00:13:23 nbsp I just bought some dice here.  The guy was friendly.  There was a poor selection of figurines for D&D though. Users/KenjiYamada

20060818 14:17:42 nbsp I would agree that it isnt much of a comic book store, but as a card and rpg store, it is fantastic, the people are helpful, the stuff is cheap, and they have great stuff going on (magic drafts). Users/TimMcIntyre

20071031 22:38:23 nbsp A previous commentor implied that it wasnt a real comic book shop, but I have been there in person and I can assure you that it does in fact exist and is neither hallucination nor illusion.  Its better than the comics shop back home, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I went in there with a vague idea of what I wanted (umm...that Batman in Victorian England, or something...) and he knew exactly what I meant and where it was.  There are also some fine deals, both for comics and manga, and the widest selection of RPG books Ive ever seen in my limited experience.  It is most certainly adequate for the casual comics/manga fan. Users/DerkB

20080315 11:02:04 nbsp The one time I went there for a magic sealed tournament, the prices were ridiculous, the prizes sucked, and the staff wasnt that friendly.   Users/EliYani

20080324 22:42:38 nbsp the dude OWNs. hes hella nice. and he likes magic, knows his comics, and will talk to u bout other random topics if you ask him. i always enjoy my visits here. Users/albertvo

20080709 00:55:52 nbsp I just recently discovered Bizarro World and its owner, Dan Urazandi, through an ebay auction. After all these years of buying comics and collectables on ebay, it is still agravating when someone like Dan Urazandi deliberately lists an inacurate description of an auction lot in order to draw in bidders, lies about the contents when potental buyers send inquiries, charges for first class postal delivery but ships by the slowest and cheapest media rate, and sends junk instead of the items described in the auction description. Thieves and liars are what give ebay a bad reputation, and Bizarro Worlds Dan Urazandi seems to be right up there with the best of them.  I hope he treats his instore customers better. Users/usagigaijin

20080727 16:05:01 nbsp Like Kyle20008, I recently visited the new place  Droms Comics and Cards on G Street. Nice people and a pretty good selection of new comics. Once this place gets up and running, it will be hard to come back to Bizarro World. Bizarro World has good stuff, but I feel like I am intruding when I go in there because the people at the counter seem to be engaged in loud, heated discussions about women, gaming, and movies. Users/jsg718

20080905 09:44:40 nbsp Great place to hangout, they got pokemon cards, yugiyo, comic books, and even some used video games for sale. Like an Atari 2600 and old super nintendo games. Users/drifterk

20080917 11:01:49 nbsp Unfortunately I have not experienced the friendly staff of which everyone speaks. Both times Ive been in there Ive gotten a very rude guy who seems to not even want to deal with customers. The last time I went it, I was barely able to tear him away from his political rant on the telephone to someone who probably was not a customer. The poor kids that were in there for cards got even less attention. Users/DreaG

20081003 19:42:14 nbsp the friendly staff everyone is referring to is named Wes, he was the only reason why i came to bizarro world because he is very friendly and helpful. the owner of this store is very rude and only really care about your money. my friends and i stopped coming to this store because we dont want to put up with the owner named Dan. Wes works at Droms comics on G street near Thai2k, and that is where i go for my magic purchases, and my friends for their comics. great place, i will never return to b.world again, ever! Users/CloudFire

20081005 22:16:26 nbsp I went there to buy some dice (my first set!) but the owner appeared completely unconcerned with helping me make my purchase.  He even seemed reluctant to take my money.  The older video games and consoles are absurdly overpriced. Users/AndrewHarrison

Users/rfrazier and users/Osenbe have the same IP address. This implies that the accounts were created on the same computer.

20081024 12:00:08 nbsp Bizarro World remains the place to purchase comics, card games or board games in Davis.  The owner, Dan, is extremely knowlegeable regarding comics past and present, their selection is outstanding and their prices are reasonable. Users/rfrazier

20081110 19:57:37 nbsp Well, Ive been shopping at Bizarro World on and off since I first moved to Davis in 2001. For a long time, I worked near Empire Comics in Sacramento and shopped there as they made a point to have everything up on their shelves at 11AM Wednesday. And BizWorld was always at the mercy of UPS. Sometimes the new books would be in at 3, sometimes 5, sometimes after  it was chaos. And more than once I walked in and asked after the status of that weeks books and would receive a snarky comment from Wes. So for a while after my job moved to Davis I made the 50mile roundtrip to Sacramento every Wednesday just to not have my time wasted and be insulted at BW.

That all changed when Wes left. I heard about Droms and was surprised to find Wes there. He repeatedly guaranteed me that he had a system that would result in the new weeks books being on the shelves by noon Wednesday (my personal top priority). Unfortunately, that proved to be a promise that for whatever reason he has not been able to reliably deliver on. One frustrated Wednesday noon a couple months ago I stopped back in at BW just to gripe to his exboss (who was very circumspect with me regarding his former employee, by the way) and was delighted to discover that weeks books in and on the shelves.

Its been two months now and Dan hasnt failed me yet. Clearly, when Droms opened around the corner, Dan felt compelled to pursue a new business model, but I dont care why Bizarro Worlds customer service suddenly improved, I just appreciate that it has. Additionally, Droms orders so few copies of most books that if youre not on the saverlist, youll miss out on many hot titles every week. The last time I went to Droms (and the new books were actually in), it was 12:05 and they were already sold out of a good halfdozen titles. If you want to grow your business, youve got to have stock to sell.

I dont have a personality problem with either Dan or Wes, but if you want your books on a reliably timely manner and dont want to miss out on titles that sell out before the store even opens, your best bet in Davis is Bizarro World. Users/abargle62

20081111 13:08:07 nbsp Does anyone know if they buy old comic books? I have some outofprint Sailor Moon comics (yes...COMICS...not tankoubons) that are just kind of...sitting around...I also have some merch... Users/ArianeMetz

Users/rfrazier and users/Osenbe have the same IP address. This implies that the accounts were created on the same computer.

20081112 20:34:16 nbsp I am not the most avid comic book collector but when I finally get around to pick up a copy of something, I can either find it here or Dan can order it. If it is out of print, Dan will find out if another print run is coming out, if it is coming out in hardcover, etc... and he calls me when it comes in. Doesnt matter if it takes a month or even two. The day it is out, he has it and he gives me a call to swing by and pick it up. Cant really complain about that. Bizarro World has been in Davis since well before I came to Davis as an undergrad and I hope it is here long after I get my doctorate. Cheers, Dan! ;)     Users/Osenbe

20081106 19:00:45 nbsp I was a long term customer of this shop. Been shopping here for years. Seems like some bias is being shown so I figured I would finally say something and put my two cents in.

When Wes was here, and he worked here for years, Dan (the owner of this shop) did absolutely nothing but praise him and would say how he was the best employee he had ever had here. He never had a bad word to say about Wes. When Wes left the store this year, that changed. Maybe it was because Wes helped open a new shop, maybe its just Dans personality... I am not sure, but after Wes left all Dan had to say was negative. Trash talking Wes every chance he had. Wes treated everyone that I saw in the shop fairly and conversed with them while still helping others. Dan would often ignore customers to help his favorites or to talk on the phone making people wait for long periods of time before even ringing them up. Dan will ignore whoever doesnt agree with him or just go on rants about how everyone is out to screw me over. It gets tired.

As far as Wes goes, he will admit he is more of a mainstream comics guy than an independent comic person. He will do whatever he can to help you even if he doesnt know the creator or title. When it comes to the mainstream books though, he knows his history and his creators. He nevers tried to get highstrung or have that attitude that you know nothing, I know everything. He was humble, friendly, and he was a great asset to this store.

I have seen what has happened here and think this rfrazier is way out of line. Dan too. Hes shown by his attitude in the store who the better man is and now that I know where Wes is, I will be going there from this day forward. Would have stayed at Bizarro if there was no other choice, but with the new shop in town, and with Dans new attitude towards Wes now when he was so flattering about him before he left... It just makes me sick. That, to me, says more about the type of shop this has become.

Sorry to go, but it was Dan that made my decision for me, followed by the drama here on this site. Users/anthonyk

20081201 11:04:17 nbsp Ive had mostly good experiences and some not so great ones here which lends my opinion of the place to be more or less neutral.
I heard theres a new comic/game place in town. Does anyone know anything about that? Users/MasonMurray

20090120 18:56:18 nbsp Prior to today I have been satisfied with this shop, but after today I will never shop there again. I went in there to buy the obama spiderman book only to have the store clerk tell me that he wanted $60 bucks for it b/c it was in such high demand. I thought that was outrageous b/c this was for the 2nd run of the issue. I then called my hometown shops only to find that all of them were charging the normal price for those that were lucky enough to get there hands on one. From this point on I will view this shop as a bunch of thieves and liars. Do not shop here. I am so upset that they would try and take advantage of such a momentous time in history. Users/metalhead15

20090211 13:47:39 nbsp I started taking two of my nephews to Bizarro World last year on a semiweekly basis. I never collected comics as a kid and reasoned that it would be a fun activity for them and something that could promote reading. The staff was very helpful when I asked about age appropriate ratings on the books. And they had solid answers for me when I inquired about obscure comics I had read about on Wikipedia. Users/Michael1976

20090923 12:24:01 nbsp This is by far the best comic store in Davis and the Sacramento area. Bizarro World has all the mainstream stuff and stocks more small press and independently published books than anywhere else. The owner, Dan Urazandi, has an encyclopedic knowledge of comics from every spectrum.  If theres a book you like he can recommend a dozen other books that might match your taste and  Ive discovered a number of books that I now count among my favorites from discussions Ive had with Dan. If he doesnt have it, he knows about it and can at least order it. He also has a complete stock of Magic cards and old school hard to  find dice and paper games.

To address some of the comments on this board questioning Dans integrity, heres a very representative example of what kind of person he is:  someone came into the shop one day with a number of very old SpiderMan comics, including the first issue. He wanted to sell the comics to Dan but  knew little about them and had no idea of their value. So Dan opened up his price guide, showed him exactly what they were worth and gave him a fair price. I know of more than a few comic shop owners who would not have hesitated to take advantage of someone with such a valuable collection who lacked a knowledge of its true worth.

If youre looking for a wellstocked store with a knowledgeable owner who can be counted on to reserve or order any book youre interested in,  I cant recommend the shop more. Users/jedalexander

20091114 11:21:28 nbsp Bizzaro world is a great place to find old comics cheap.  Dan has many long runs that are quite cheap, and then he has the half price sales that last a long time.  If you are traveling past Davis on highway 80, a lot of people do, you might want to take a rest stop here in Davis and check out the store.  Dan is friendly and he knows his stuff. Users/RichardBruce

20091123 22:23:39 nbsp I just went into Bizzaro World today and was disappointed to find that my previous comment which was almost two weeks old had not cleared the shelves.  Dan has a bunch of long boxes filled with sets marked at half price.  Some may be less than 50 cents an issue, most less than a dollar.  Many old comics in the back are not in sets, but at 25 cents an issue it allows you to explore the worlds of Marvel, DC, and others on the cheap.  Once again Bizarro is a great place to buy old comics cheap.  Now I would not want you to waste and pollute by making a special trip to Davis, but if you are driving by on highway 80, why not stop in. Users/RichardBruce

20091226 20:05:49 nbsp bizzaro world is the best gaming store i have ever been to! the selection is great in all areas and the owner is very nice! i definitly preffer it to droms or any other store!
lol c@@l Users/pokebenjamin

20100115 22:56:54 nbsp Id have to say the Bizarro World is a great comic shop... best in town.  Not because they have a great selection or great customer service, but for everything as a whole.  Dan makes an effort to meet and greet everyone and not talk down to them in regards to games or comic history like that other comic shop in town.  My kids and I have gone into Droms a couple of times and got completely ignored, except the time I asked a question, and got a snide remark because I didnt know what I was talking about.  When we go to Bizarro World, Dan takes the time to discuss and explain things.  Hands down, Bizarro World gets my vote. Congrats on the new location. Users/Aaron.Curtin



20100203 13:37:28 nbsp   The new location is AWESOME. I love the layout, it looks like a gaming store now, not just comics (which was never BAD, just that now there is a lot more space).
I especially LOVE the arcade. I intend to use it a lot.
plus, as always, Dan is a fun dood.Users/TravisLindquist

20100209 16:37:05 nbsp Also for the record, I think Dans a great guy, have always had favorable experiences in his shop, and am overjoyed to see that hes taken residence in the shell of Bogeys Books. My name is Aaron Sikes and I approve this message. Users/ArthurFrane

20100221 19:56:46 nbsp I went here a few weeks ago and bought Atomic Dreams, volume 2 of Echo by Terry Moore. Its really good, Terry Moores new series is awesome and I will probably start reading it regularly again as a saver here at Bizarro World. Im looking forward to seeing the movie also. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100311 09:09:11 nbsp Ive been hearing that starting with PHB3, Wizards is giving Premier stores new sourcebook releases a week or two early.  Is BW in the premier program, or whatever?  Will they be getting early releases? Users/TomGarberson

20100318 09:43:19 nbsp My kids worked through their Pokemon phase with this shop and are now fully embedded in YuGiOh. Dan is super nice to kids, never betrays any impatience with the fact that they linger over the display cases for 20 minutes before spending 25 cents. He would sponsor free Pokemon tournaments and give the kids free stuff. He seems willing to make reasonable trades for YuGiOh cards just to stir up the stock in the display cases; Ive often felt that my kids got the better end of the deal, compared to Ebay prices. Hes the reason you shop at a small business instead of a megastore or Ebay.

His new location is great, with tons of space and arcade games and a table for gaming. I hope it thrives there. Parents of Davistake your kids here instead of Target! Dan will treat them right. Users/Virginia

20100321 23:59:39 nbsp Maybe I caught the staff on a bad day, but I did not find any friendly employees on my visit today. I didnt think I did anything disrespectful, but an employee shot a condescending comment my way. Made my boyfriend and me very uncomfortable  we left without buying the Tasha Yar action figure I wanted. But, to err is human and we can all have our devastatingly irrational moments, so Ill give the store another shot. However, if Im treated like a dumb blonde bimbo again, Ill spend my money at an establishment who knows how to treat a lady lookin for a Tasha Yar doll.  Users/spectra

20100420 23:20:13 nbsp Oh, I remember dropping so much dough on Star Wars and Star Trek cards back when it was located kind of where it is now and where it was before. I walked by the new location on Picnic Day a few days ago and I thought I saw an arcade in the back. Now that Ive read they really have one, Ill be sure to walk in once more! Users/CecilioPadilla

20100422 14:06:43 nbsp Bizarro World has always had wonderful staff and many pokemon options.....However, ever since they moved to their new location the smell of the inside has forced me to start looking elsewhere. I am not sure what it is and we have tried two or three times, but each time I feel so sick from the smell that permeates that place. Please try to fix b/c we love your store and want to shop there. Users/emoon

20100501 17:24:48 nbsp Ive been known to spend a few hours just browsing, or going through various books. The downside? Dan has a tendency to forget Im in the store and will lock me in when he goes to lunch. Seriously. Its happened at least five times, at each of the locations (including the old Four Color Comics place, which was tiny). Users/Flynn

20100517 21:00:20 nbsp Ive been to the shop a few times to play magic the gathering and a few times the staff has made disrespectful comments about my friends and I. Im not entirely sure why this happened as I am friends with a lot of people that frequent the store. Ive had fun playing with my friends at the store from time to time but my experience could have been a bit better. Maybe i just caught the staff on a bad day or i did something to offend one of them. The store also has some cool weekly events like EDH nights and sealed league i believe and Dan, the owner, seems like a pretty cool guy. Other than a few rude comments my experience here has been ok.    Users/chidori612

20100604 12:50:19 nbsp Im happy to report that Bizarro World now carries Games Workshop Warhammer fantasy and 40k products.  Anyone reading this who plays 40k in Davis should email me, kawende@gmail.com.  Im getting back into the hobby and looking for a gaming group. Users/kawende

20100615 20:16:55 nbsp Bizarro world is hands down one of the most dishonest trading card game store Ive been to. I played yugioh here for about a year and a half before completely giving up on this place. Dan is the person who is there the most, which is unfortunate because hes also the owner. Not only is he completely rude but hes especially deceitful to the young players because their parents and the kids dont know how much their cards are actually worth. Not to mention that his case of cards are all overpriced. The tournaments are also pretty crappy because he will never give out more than three packs to first place even if twenty people enter the tournament. Each pack of cards costs the store roughly 2.50. So if twenty people enter, thats one hundred dollars. After you take out cost of one pack per entry youll find hes always netting at least half just off the tournaments. And even with this, he never gives back to the players in fact he still will continue to reap off the children. Theres a reason why you wont find older players playing at bizarro and only little children, and its because the kids and parents just dont know any better. There are much more respectable places to go if you nice clean innocent fun or business. Try Great Escape in Sacramento near Arden Fair mall, Olde World games in Vacaville, or Droms Comics and Cards in Davis.      Users/Morphintime

20100616 02:08:40 nbsp Does the new store have a pen and paper RPG sessions like D&D and FATE? Im interested in expanding my gaming group as some have graduated and a few people have left for other personal reasons so Im kind of down to like 2 other friends who play... Users/MasonMurray

20100710 13:33:01 nbsp Bizzaro World has a huge collection of old comics, with prices down to 25 cents, and then there are sales.  It also has old records, video games, graphic novels, collectible old toys, and a bunch of other stuff.  Lots of real bargains. Users/RichardBruce

20100806 15:49:36 nbsp The owner has some major ethics issues in my opinion.  I see him all the time at SPCA thrift store and garage sales buying video games, records, etc. and then he resells them at his  store.  For example he buys records at the thrift store for 10 cents and resells them for $10 or more.  He bought a Guitar Hero guitar at the thrift store for $1 (I know because my son set it down as he was unsure he was gonna buy it and the owner snatched it up and ran to the register) and I am sure it will end up in his store marked up for $20.  Just like Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons....creepy.    Users/stodd84

20110401 14:57:31 nbsp As someone who moved to Dixon recently and had no particular loyalty moving into town.  I can say that Bizarro World has effectively turned away my business.  Regardless of how successful the competing store is, Bizarro will never be where I frequent.  As a magic the Gathering player, I was turned off by the fact that they lost their DCI sanctioning due to inappropriate business practices.  The prices in their case are far from fair.  Sometimes they are 2x3x the average price.  They sponsor players to play in their unsanctioned tournaments who turn prized back to the store.  They do not even have a level 1 judge to help with rules.  There bulk selection is equally overpriced and unorganized.  Do not be surprised if you see very few Magic players in the shop.  They have done everything they could to persuade people not to come.  Users/SeanPatch

20110430 09:27:38 nbsp SeanPatch, do you have any published reports to back up your accusations? These accusations seem pretty serious and I sure havent heard of them before! Users/MyRealName
  If you follow the link in the top of the page that mentions them no longer being sanctioned, youll find the DCI website lists them as suspended (under the owners name) for sales violations.  Also, why the strange, aggressive MyRealName?  Glance up... most people use their names here because were (most of us) neighbors in the same town.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  It says sales violation and gives no mention as to what that is. I cant make the jump to inappropriate business practices, but Im not worried about that. Im not sure how different pricing of cards makes them not fair. Ive never heard of fair pricing. If you dont like their prices, go someplace else. Im sorry you take MyRealName as aggressive, it is not intended as such. The site asked for my real name when I was signing up so I gave it! wink. (also this reply might be messed up since I cant figure out how to do it without going in and editing the whole page.) Users/MyRealName
    I seem to recall that theres another page that details it a bit more, still on the DCI site.  A local certified judge did also confirm on the wiki that Bizarro is not allowed to run official tournaments, but that was part of some other issue, so it may have been deleted (but could probably be found if you look in the edit history... probably for the Talk page).     As for the pricing, yep  thats subjective.  Which is where it comes down to Sean believing its not fair.   Dont worry about messing up  we all work together on the wiki, so if you mess up, somebody will jump in to help.  Not a big deal.  jw

20110503 14:35:26 nbsp @Sean Patch  Hey, sorry you didnt like the prices!  Can you give some specifics as to what cards you think were unfairly priced?  As far as I know, most prices are consistent with online prices.  Some are a bit higher, but theres no ship cost, so that offsets it.  Some are lower!  For instance, Aether Vial is currently sitting at about 75% of the online cost!

Also, there are plenty of ways to negotiate price! Users/TravisLindquist

He also often suggests products which is the hallmark of a great salesperson: Oh, you like X?  Well have you taken a look at Y?  He is the only reason Ill even consider heading out to this store.

Dan, on the other hand, has been consistently cold and distant to me whenever Ive talked to him.  Hes tried to rush my buying decisions on multiple occasions and generally not been very kind to me.

20110529 18:17:26 nbsp @TravisLindquist I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner.  I went in today, to see if I was wrong about the pricing.  Here are a couple cards that stuck out in my mind;
Jace the Mind Sculptor  $100, Channel Fireball  $79.99, SCG  $79.99
Goblin Guide  $10, Channel Fireball  $4.99, SCG  $5.49
Progenitus  $15, Channel Fireball  $11.99, SCG  $10.99

There were more in the case with similar price differences.  If I am buying cards, it just doesnt make sense to pay a $4$20 markup on each card.  If I see a lot of prices that are off, I prefer to play it safe and buy nothing rather than find out when I get home that I got screwed over.  Maybe if I played in the shop, I could make an exception every now and then.  With no DCI sanctioned tournaments, that is not an option for me.

@MyRealName  I will try and not turn this into some sort of fight.  Sales Violation implies you were performing an activity to do with sales, which is a business practice.  The violation part definitely falls under the umbrella of inappropriate behavior.  In my opinion, not a very large jump to make. Users/SeanPatch

  and, of course, the shipping on that Progenitus, that you are saving $3.01 on, is $2.96. I just checked it out. Enjoy your 5 cents savings.  Users/DonShor
    Yeah, the third card isnt much of a net saving solo, but thats clearly a silly example to nitpick.  Thats still be $17 for the first card and a couple for the second.  Consider that 5 cents an extra bonus ;)  Or if you buy multiple cards and shipping price is the same...   it adds up much quicker.  users/edwins ES
   My point, Ed, is that comparing brickandmortar retailers with online retailers is specious. To suggest that Bizarro World (or any other retailer) is using some sort of unfair markup (I got screwed over) is inaccurate. A retail store in downtown Davis pays a retail lease, has much higher insurance costs, and any number of other expenses that online retailers dont have. And to fail to include the shipping cost makes the comparison dishonest. Finally, the online retailer should be charging and paying California sales tax on the purchase, but probably isnt. Compare apples to apples: what do the cards cost at other walkin stores? Online shopping is a different thing entirely. Users/DonShor
     I suspect that pricing above the listed value of cards is roughly equivalent to selling above MSRP.  Maybe not unfair, but  a sign that theyre doing something wrong with pricing.  As a disclaimer, I havent played M:TG in at least a decade, but back then list price was the default for individual cards in brick and mortar stores.  Anything above list price was considered a ripoff. Users/TomGarberson
     A 20% price variance, with 10% or so factored back in for shipping, isnt far from general industry norms where online and walkin retail is concerned. It varies within retail sectors, obviously. DS

20110615 08:03:37 nbsp @ everyone who commented about pricing for my review.

As a member of the mailing list for both websites.  I get free shipping on orders over $50.  I rarely order 1x of any card. I usually order a playset 4x.  So, I would be losing $16 on that one card as part of a larger order.

You may not think that comparing a brick and mortar card store to an online retailer is fair, but other shops in the area obviously disagree.  Droms, Great Escape Games, A1 Comics and Adventures in Comics all provide prices that are in line with current online prices.  They will even look up prices on cards if you believe the price is not right.  Why in the world would I knowingly spend more money, when cheaper options are readily available? I would have to either really love the shop, which I obviously dont, or be crazy to do such a thing. Users/SeanPatch

20110807 00:56:25 nbsp I dont know much about comics and come here mostly for the books. Theyre a little on the pricey side for used books, most ranging from about $3.50 to $5, but Ive seen a couple marked as $2.50 and sometimes he has a sale where slowselling books are sold for less! I wish there was a bigger selection, but understand that isnt the main attraction of the store... The owner seems a little gruff and unfriendly but hes never been outright rude to me. I think he gets annoyed when people come in and dont buy anything. Sometimes I sell my used fantasy/scifi novels and he gives me a pretty decent price in store credit but he only works certain hours so its hard to get a hold of him sometime and nobody else can sell. The assistant guy with the black beard is SUPER NICE! He is always very helpful when I have questions and seems to know a lot about cards.

Ladies, be forewarned: sometimes its a little awkward going in there because there are almost no girls in thereever! Ive met some really creepy people in there who stared and invaded my personal space and asked me weird questions.

This was the first one I visited, and although they didnt have what I was looking for, I didnt find my experience too bad, but there were a lot of people there and it made me a bit nervous. The guy behind the counter did ask me what I was looking for though, which I think helps shyer customers find what they need. I then went to Droms, and I dont know if I caught them at a bad time or something but I didnt really feel welcome there for whatever reason. Bought some penny sleeves and then bailed.

When I pointed this out to him he muttered something under his breath, took the packs back and moved on to another customer, leaving me there. I waited another five minutes before another staff member came up and sold me the packs. Other than the terrible customer service, the place is dirty, unorganized and smells like an old shoe.

20120408 03:08:24 nbsp You would think that a local comic book shop in a small town would be a friendly place to shop at.

Before I moved to Davis to attend UCD, I used to patronize the comic shops back in the Bay Area. Two of my favorite comic shops were Dr. Comics and Mr.Games in Oakland and Comic Relief in Berkeley. My shopping experience at those stores was excellent. Both shops were run by knowledgeable and friendly staff. Both shops have an excellent selection of comics; Particularly the indie stuff. After graduating from high school in 2006 and bound for UC Davis, going to the local comic shop was one of the places I looked forward to visiting. If my  previous experiences at a comic book store would be so great, my experience at Bizarro would surely be just as phenomenal. Right?

How I couldnt be more wrong.

I first patronized Bizarro at their previous location back in 2007. The location was much smaller and cramped. The comic selection was pitiful. The shelves and items were poorly organized.There was very little ventilation in the store itself. Everything seemed filthy. The shelves looked as though they have not been dusted for quite some time. All of the items look like they were inferior second hand items. I thought maybe the staff would make up for the substandard ambiance and wares.

Unfortunately, I was again contradicted. The staff glared at me while I was scoping their merchandise;As if I had any interest in swiping their thirdrate items. The owner of the store was a rude, pompous prat with a largely undeserved ego. When I asked for his help, he gave me brusque comments as if I interrupted him from doing anything highly significant. His knowledge of comics or Geek Culture  was not impressive at all. When I tried to strike a conversation with him, he asked me Why the hell are you even talking to me? Hes highly reminiscent of the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. Except that the owner is less amusing. And less intelligent for that matter.

I was so disgusted by the business of the store, I never went back to the location after my fourth visit. I went back to Bizarros a few years later when they moved from their old location to the building that used to be owned by a used bookstore(Which was a nice, wellrun store by the way. Pity that they went out of business. If only it was Bizarros that suffered that fate.) I attended the store with a friend of mine during their grand opening. I was hoping that the store improved with location.

I was right. Albeit it was marginal. There was a few more selections. It was definitely larger and better ventilated. And they had arcade games. Alas, it was still filthy and poorly disorganized. While the selection was larger, it was still  abysmal in comparison to the comic book stores I used to frequent growing up. The items were still of inferior quality. And the staff were still as meanspirited and nasty as before. My friend asked me if he had to pay with cash to play the games. One of the employees got in our private conversation and said duhhhhhh!!! as if he even asked him in the first place(It may be a silly question but it still didnt warrant a rude response. Especially from someone who wasnt even involved in our business to begin with. Besides, some places do use tokens instead of actual coins). That was the last straw for me. I never went back since.

All and all, Bizarro is a laughable failure of a comic book store.  Users/HumbertoSilva

20120906 15:31:53 nbsp I have been there maybe 1015 times over the past year and every time that I come in and the owner, Dan, is there i have an uncomfortable experience. He is cold, distant, and even rude sometimes. He comes off as if he doesnt want to get to know his customers or even help them at all. He should really get his act together because he honestly makes me reconsider entering the store when I pass by.

On the other hand there is another guy that works there whose name i do not know. He is a pretty tall, blonde but balding man. He is always nice when I come in, always greets me and asks if there is anything in particular I am looking for and even strikes up conversations with me from time to time. He should honestly just be the only person working there because it would make it much more likely for me to make a purchase  something I am unlikely to do thanks to their crazy prices for any of their magic the gathering stuff (which is what I go in there for).

20130511 15:28:36 nbsp ABSOLUTELY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL TO CUSTOMERS! DO NOT SHOP HERE. Dan Urazandi is absolutely the worst business owners I have ever encountered. I called to ask about why I had a $14 charge from Bizarro World when I havent shopped there since 2012. He said  its a late fee charge, I asked Can you explain that, Im confused at how I could have accrues this, I rented movies and returned them without incident last year. He then proceeds to berate me and ask What dont you understand about the English language and the word late fee, which you agreed to pay when you signed our contract which allowed you to rent here. When I politely challenged the policy of charging people a year later, he very agressively responded WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FEES ARE JUST GOING TO VAPORIZE! When I asked him if he is normally this rude to paying customers or if he is just having a bad day, he said I have work to do and youre wasting my time. WOW! This guy seriously has absolutely no concept of customer service. As if people are not going to question a charge on their account when they havent been to the business since last year! Charge people for their late fees right then and there when they accrue them, or call them and let them know they owe. I dont mind paying (even though the late fees are more than I paid to rent the movie) but they should let people know before charging their card unannounced. The owner is incredibly rude and really should not be working with people. Users/LorenJ

20130617 14:14:06 nbsp THE MOST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHADY BUSINESS EVER!   I’ve recently started going to Bizarro for about a year as I have a 5 year old son that has become enamored with comics and action figures.  We’ve purchased several comics and I really appreciated the selection of Grated stuff appropriate for his age group. A neighbor recommend the DVD rentals at Bizarro and we decided to give it a try.  We were very excited to have a local place to walk to and get DVDs and I was again surprised and pleased at the selection they had for new releases and kids movies.

Our first DVD rental was a nightmare!

The disk got stuck/skipped about half way through the movie and we had to fast forward to get it to keep working (after it crashing 2 times and having to start over from the main menu). However, this really didn’t bother us too much because we’ve had this happen from rented DVDs from other places before (including Netflix).

We returned the DVD on time and interestingly, this one occasion, we actually opened the DVD case about a half block from the store to check and make sure we put it back in the case.  So, as luck would have it I had a very vivid, clear memory of the DVD on the day it was returned being in good condition without damage. We dropped it off to be on went on our merry way.

Two days later I get an email from the shop owner Dan saying we were being charged $30 replacement fee because we returned the DVD with “serious damage”.  I went down to the shop immediately that same day and asked to see the DVD.  A friendly shop employee told me that it had 3 major scratches in the DVD.  He said they cleaned it in their cleaning equipment and they mostly came out but that it still won’t play and is unusable.  When he showed me the disc it had 2 tiny, pinhead size dots on the surface. I found it hard to believe that the disc didn’t work. He told me that he hadn’t been the one to test it but that the owner Dan did so he “assumed it didn’t work because Dan wouldn’t charge you a fee if it was working”.  He told me to call back the next day when Dan was working to talk with him about it.

When I called Dan and inquired about the situation he was SO RUDE and down right mean.  I expressed my concerns and told him that I was more than willing to pay for damage we caused but in this case I had inspected the disc moments before turning it in and there was no damage. He told me “I don’t understand why I need to take the time to explain this to you because you signed the rental agreement and you seem to understand that you have to pay for damage you caused.”  I repeated that I was being honest about my inspecting the disc before returning it and how was I to know it wasn’t damaged in the shop itself after it was returned. (The shop is a filthy mess with stacks upon stacks of things on top of each other and the merchandise is not well cared for). He made some enraged rude remarks where he continued to sling personal insults.

I told him how disappointing it was to have this treatment from a local business we try to support in Downtown and that I was going to post my reviews on Daviswiki and Yelp. To this he said “Go ahead, People write lies about us all the time on DavisWiki and they aren’t true.”

He then jumped in claiming that this was a 2 disc set and if I wanted to come back down to the store he would show me the damage on the 2nd disc that they didn’t clean off. I told him I don’t understand why the employee didn’t show me that damage yesterday when I did come into the shop asking to see the damage and became even more suspicious of being unjustly accused by Dan and the staff.

I told Dan I would not pay the fee and would contest his charges with my credit card company.  To this he replied, “You have such a pathetic existence that you have to run all over town spreading lies instead of taking responsibility for the damage you caused”.  This was my 1st and last DVD rental at Bizarro World.  We will never patronize this business again. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT A PLACE THAT WILL ONLY LIE TO YOU, STEAL FROM YOU, AND INSULT YOU!

I am somewhat relieved for my son that Droms comics is also in town and there is always Amazon.com (sorry Downtown Merchants).
