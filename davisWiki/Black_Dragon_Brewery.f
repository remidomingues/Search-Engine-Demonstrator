The Black Dragon Brewery, at the same location as Woodland Homebrew Supply, is now open! For the first few weeks, it will run as a tap house serving interesting local beers. Soon, all sixteen taps will serve Black Dragon beers (brewed on site).  The selection will include a few different IPAs, their signature Dragons Eye Porter, Blonde Ales & much more.

The food selection consists of light pub fare including appetizers and a variety of sliders. They will have live music on the weekends, festivals on the lawn area, and much, much more...stay tuned!

20120629 18:41:55 nbsp The pub is not officially open, but when I stopped by today to pick up some brew supplies they let me try a couple beers while I shopped around. The beers were good. The place doesnt look like much from the outside, but the interior is well done and the staff was very nice/helpful. Im excited about the convenience of having a local home brew shop in the vicinity. Im also excited about Yolo County getting another brewery. Users/MikeyCrews
