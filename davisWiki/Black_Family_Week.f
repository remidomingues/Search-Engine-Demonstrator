Black Family Week (BFW) is one of the SPAC Culture Days. According to the SPAC page, Black Family Week at UC Davis is a weeklong annual celebration of the various cultures of people of African descent. It presents programs that promote an awareness and understanding of the educational, social and artistic achievements of African people. The programs foster positive selfconcept and cultural pride in members of the community as well as develop cultural and ethnic awareness/sensitivity in the broader Davis community.
