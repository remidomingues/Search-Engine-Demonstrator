Black Out Night is annual even held by Aggie Pack to promote mens and womens basketball by giving away black tshirts with black writing on them. Also, the players have to play basketball in the dark. Theres really no point in going to this game because the only thing you can see are emergency exit signs. Also, its an auditory mess, since no one in the Banduh! can see their music or the student director, so bring ear plugs.  Its exceptionally difficult to catch burritos in nearcomplete darkness, so Users/arlenabraham I recommend bringing a helmet and a Butterflies & Moths butterfly net.

Okay, so in reality Black Out Night doesnt involve a basketball game in the dark, but wouldnt it be funny if it did?  If you know something about what Black Out Night really is, please add it here!
