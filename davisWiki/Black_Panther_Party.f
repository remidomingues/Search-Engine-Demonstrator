A couple of members from the commemoration committee for the BPP were coming to Davis mid November 2007. theyll be putting on presentations and trying to garner solidarity with student groups for their campaign of getting younger kids reading. Some of the visitors are/have been members of the BPP, including one that started the breakfast program.

20070925 10:54:58 nbsp I saw Bobby Seale at a Malaquias Montoya art opening at the UCD Basement Gallery. I wanted to tell Mr. Seale how much i admired the Black Panthers and all the work he had done, but, I was wearing a skirt and wasnt sure how the BPP felt about cross dressing, so I didnt even say hello.

    dang, thats sweet. your comment should be integrated into the main body. did you know bobby seale had been bound and gagged in the courtroom during his court case? i was told hes the only person thats happened to in the us...dunno.
       No, its relatively common.  I used to hear the Public Defenders debating if it was a help or hindrance when it happened to their clients.  IIRC, it is a judicial order enforced by the bailiff when a defendant (who has to be in the courtroom) keeps disrupting the judicial process.  Some people try to simply shout and/or threaten their way out of court, and the question was always if the outbursts or the jury watching them in shackles and gagged is worse.  (And yes, some of the outbursts and rants can actually be worse for the defense than their client sitting there shackled and gagged).  Another common reason for shackles was suicide attempts.  Theres a unique thud and low tone when a human body hits a 5th floor hurricane resistant window trying to go through and is bounced back that I dont think Ill ever forget.  He is far from the only one.  Users/JabberWokky
