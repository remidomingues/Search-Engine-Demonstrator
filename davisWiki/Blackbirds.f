Davis has two commonly seen species of blackbird.
  The Redwinged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) can be found near water and marshy areas like the Vic Fazio Wildlife Area Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area and any pond with tall grasses surrounding it. Also try North Area Pond, West Area Pond, and Davis Wetlands.  The males are matte black with bright red epaulettes (shoulder patches) with a thin line of yellow below each.  These epaulettes are on proud display in the early spring as males sing, stake out their territories, and try to impress the other birds.  When not being shown off, the patches can be hard to see.  Females are mottled in shades of brown and are sometimes mistaken for very large sparrows.  In spring, a flock of males arrives first; and a flock of females comes later.  Nests are off the ground in tules, reeds, or mustard.

  The Brewers Blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus) is the side of the road blackbird often seen in parking lots.  The male can be identified by the overall glossy sheen and a bright yellow iris.  The female is drab brown.  (Note: Grackles have the same coloration but much bigger tails.  While not yet common, Grackles have been sighted near Davis and may soon appear in town.  users/LoisRichter 2010/08)

  A third species occasionally found here is the YellowHeaded Blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus).  Sometimes youll find a few in the midst of the hundreds of RedWings nesting in the cattails in the Yolo Bypass wetlands in the spring.  The males are easy to spot  with very bright yellow head and chest and large white wing patches that can be seen when flying.

   Ive never gotten a good photo of one, but I did paint a picture.  Heres the male in courtship pose. Users/LoisRichter

Mixed blackbird flocks  which can number in the hundreds  are often joined by BrownHeaded Cowbirds.  Rarely, some Tricolored Blackbirds will also join in.
