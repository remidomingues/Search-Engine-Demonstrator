Blackfish is a black kitten who was adopted from the Yolo County Animal Shelter.  His formal name is Ser Benjamyn Tully.  (Kudos to anyone who gets the reference.)  He is very graceful, except for his long neck that makes his big kitten head stick out in a cute but awkward way.  He lives with Users/DanaSullivan Dana Sullivan, Users/DavidSimon David Simon, and Shoggoth.
