Blackie and Orangey are the Wiki Animals cats of Users/DaveyReed.  He loves them very much.  They are both 11, and have birthdays of March 30, and April 1.

Blackie

Blackie is a tabby.  He is fluffy and wonderful, but his breath really stinks.  He is very loving though, and loves to follow me around.

Orangey

Orangey is also a tabby, and very big.  He usually weighs around 15 pounds compared to Blackies 12.  Both look larger than they are due to their extreme amount of fur.
