Blackmon & Associates was a criminal defense firm located in downtown Sacramento.  The closed in March 2012.  They were located in Sacramentos old Hall of Justice, across the street from the new federal courthouse.  The firms principal, Clyde Blackmon has been practicing for more than 40 years, having graduated from Boalt Hall (UC Berkeley School of Law) in 1964.  He has a fairly impressive http://www.blackmonassociates.com/attorneyprofiles/clydemblackmon/ record of published appellate and state Supreme Court successes.

Blackmon & Associates has received a top tier rating for both white collar and nonwhite collar criminal defense from USNews.  This listing will appear in the upcoming Money edition of the magazine which should hit news stands in November 2011.

The firm takes on criminal cases and appeals of all sorts in Yolo County, Sacramento County, and beyond.  They practice in both state and federal courts.  They also take on professional licensing administrative law cases that can arise from criminal matters (usually handled by Jonathan Turner).

To get there, take Business 80/50 east, exit I5 north, and exit J street.  Its about 3 blocks down on your right.  Street parking is sparse, so youre better off using the public parking beneath the building.  If you enter at 7th Street, just south of J (right next to the 24 Hour Fitness; you cant miss the driveway), the elevator for 660 J is feet away on your right.  Its also within 13 blocks of the downtown/old town Amtrak station, downtown light rail, and numerous bus lines.
