20120209 17:00:26 nbsp After two and half years of treatment, Dr. Jacobson created so many new problems for my wifes teeth. Dr. Jacobson asked my wife to extract four teeth to make space without any measurement (He said he measured by his eyes and has absolutely no record for the measurement and calculation). The worst thing is that he cannot seal the gap after the tooth extraction. To try to fix the gap problem, Dr. Jacobson eventually made her lower front teeth lean inward and her upper front teeth outward. Now my wife has to hire a second orthodontist to fix the problems created by Dr. Jacobson and probably need to implant four teeth back. When she asked Dr. Jacobson to get our money back and pay for the follow up treatment, he laughed at her. So if ever you want to hire him to fix your teeth, good luck with that!  Users/Gregx

     Dr. Jacobson is very unprofessional and careless. He did not take any picture or any measurement during the treatment over 2 years. My general dentist also complained that they never received any records from Dr. Jacobson while most orthodontists they work with always keep them updated about patients progress. Dr. Jacobson often forgot what he planned to do in my previous visit and I had to remind him, then he would say: Oh thats right and brought equipments over. I would never say he is gentle and careful; my mouth often got scratched when he took wires/ rubber bands out. No mention when he took out the braces, he broke the brackets so hard, my teeth hurt so much that I thought my teeth were pulled by him.
     His staff were terrible too. Steve, the one sitting in the front desk/ arranging appointments, never smiled. I once told him that my next appointment needed to be longer because the doctor promised to clean the stains on my teeth (although he never really did good job at that, mostly gave me shower...), Steve yelled at me that is your general dentists job! Of course next time Dr. Jacobson did not clean my teeth because he forgot again. His assistant, dont remember her name, once put the power chain (the rubber bands all connected together) on for me, she did not realize she missed the first tooth until she finished the last tooth. She had to take out everything and redo it. Omg >_<
     Their office is also unpleasant. The clock on the wall always tells the same time. The bathroom was broken for months and they did not care to get it fixed. I also had hard time finding floss/toothpaste around their tiny sink for patients to brush teeth.
     I was not satisfied with my results but Dr. Jacobson insisted it was ideal and took out the braces. My general dentist was shocked when I went for teeth cleaning, and told me my results were UNACCEPTABLE for a dentist! My friend said Are you kidding? You dont look like someone just had braces off! You need one! Please dont waste your time and money with Dr. Jacobson! I hope you are not the next one abused by Dr. Jacobson! Users/YingshanHsu

20120307 18:14:26 nbsp I am very pleased with my results, I really enjoyed my experience at Jacobson Orthodontics. Dr. Jacobson is very professional,knowledgeable,kind and patient. I very much appreciated all the individualized care Dr.Jacobson spent on my treatment.  I definitely was shocked to see the outrageous comment that other person seems to be leaving everywhere since my experience was so opposite, I found getting other dental work done very easy because Dr.Jacobson would always work with my dentist, once he and his staff came  in just to see me on his day off so I could make my dental appointment before a vacation. I agree with the other comment, Dr. Jacobson is top notch! Very smart , nice, great with kids and caring. Jacobson Orthodontics is the place to go if your looking for superior orthodontic care with a warm , fun , friendly environment .    Users/RoseEdwards

20120401 12:24:47 nbsp VERY HAPPY with my results, Dr. Jacobson is a wonderful Orthodontist! He really seems to put a lot of extra care and attention when it comes to patient treatment. I remember how careful and thorough Dr. Jacobson was when examining my teeth during treatment, he once noticed a few problems that my dentist recently missed. I cant thank Dr. Jacobson enough for giving me such exceptional care, he was so patient ,kind, professional and just a REALLY NICE PERSON. My experience at Jacobson Orthodontics was extremely pleasant, very easy to schedule appointments around work , nice office and staff.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great Orthodontic experience! Users/Bella28

20120615 19:35:04 nbsp I came in to get new retainers because they were not fitting properly. I have to say that I am really impressed with Dr. Jacobson. He is extremely honest and could have easily told me that I needed new retainers (and they cost an arm and a leg!).. instead he insisted that my old retainers were fine and just needed some adjusting. They fit perfectly now. Really happy with my experience. He is also very knowledgeable and down to earth!  Users/MariaNguyen

20130306 20:44:35 nbsp Most of what needs to be said about Blain Jacobson can be found in the prior comments. He is a shady and unprofessional orthodontist who accordingly belongs at the bottom of anyones list. I immediately got a bad vibe when I first walked into his office, which was a very cluttered, uncomfortable little room with chairs that look like they were bought at a garage sale. The staff were rude and unfriendly possibly because it was before noon. Jacobson himself seems indifferent toward you as a person, makes assumptions about you, and (as already mentioned by others) does seem to remember or write down what happened at previous appointments. Not recommended. Users/TimothyFoster
