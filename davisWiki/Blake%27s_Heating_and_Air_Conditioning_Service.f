20060725 16:34:11 nbsp Blakes came to the aid of the Turtle House during the heatwave, coming out on a Sunday to fix a stalled air conditioner, much to the relief of the house residents. They are the best.  Users/SharlaDaly

20100702 17:30:31 nbsp I can recommend Blakes. Theyve always done good work. This morning I called them at 10 am because the
fan had stopped running in my outdoor condensing unit. They scheduled a sameday appointment, and David arrived
around 1 pm. He immediately diagnosed the problema bad capacitorand replaced it. David also checked the freon
and my thermostats.  Users/nowhereman

20101224 09:50:07 nbsp It became evident that our heat was not working –the heat exchanger on our very old unit had crackedand our heater needed to be replaced. My friend who is an HVAC engineer for large commercial buildings and an expert in alternative and green HVAC systems said I should call Blake’s. Mark Blake came by the house and patiently answered all of my myriad questions. He recommended a particular “package unit” and explained why he thought it was the best choice. Mark invited me to get quotes from other companies but I never did because I trusted his explanation of why his prices were as good as anyone else. His explanation made sense so I did not bother to shop around. Besides, I felt good about supporting a local business that has been serving the area for many, many years and donates money to numerous groups in our community. Mark was also very knowledgeable about the state and federal government rebates for highefficiency units.
This happened during the exceptionally cold week just before Thanksgiving. Mark noticed that we have an infant and promised to prioritize our replacement over customers who were not without heat. His staff ordered the unit, picked it up, and installed it the day before Thanksgiving. I learned that the foreman has been working for Blake’s for 19 years, which suggests that I was also supporting a company that treats its workers well. The install team replaced much of the ducts in my attic for no additional charge because it was incorrectly sized. My wife remarked that the installers did not leave a spot of dirt in our house. We were very happy with Blake’s and would

20110103 09:43:31 nbsp The staff is rude and I saw one of its drivers almost run over a small girl on a bike today. He got out of the car and yelled at her out of annoyance when he was the one at fault and blocking the bike lane.....??? Ridiculous. Dont do business with these people. Users/Blam

20110103 19:11:25 nbsp I was more than pleased with the service I received from Blakes when my heat stopped blowing on January 3, 2011.  I called the office at 3:30 p.m. and a very pleasant woman named Jean said she would try to have someone come that afternoon or the following day.  At 4:00 p.m. Tim arrived.  Amazingly, he remembered that he had been to my house ten years ago.  He quickly diagnosed the problem (I needed a new circuit board).  While he waited for the right part to be delivered, he fixed a leak around a vent pipe that he had noticed in my attic.  The heatsystem job was finished shortly after 5:00, and the price seemed reasonable.  It was wonderful that I didnt have to take off work the next day.  Tim was very friendly and helpful, and it was nice to hear that he had been with the company since 1999.  Blakes is obviously a good workplace, and I will gladly use their services again.
