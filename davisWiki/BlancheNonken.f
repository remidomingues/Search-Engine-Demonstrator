Weird Things I Can Do: Im working on the call of the Western ScrubJay.  Flag me down if you see me around, and Ill teach you how.  I think there should be more people walking around the streets of Davis going SquourEEE! SquourEEE!

I also talk to Crow Migration crows.  Sometimes they answer back.  Im pretty sure I have the basics down  I started learning by listening to the crows in Orange County, CA.  It seems they have a different dialect or language than the crows in Davis, which doesnt surprise me.  The ones in OC seem to have a simpler vocabulary, fewer variety of sounds; the places I lived havent been inhabited by humans for very long, the crow communities I learned from havent been there more than 30 to 50 years; only two or three generations in Crow Years.  The Davis Crows are more complex in their communication.

You can find me most afternoons behind the meat counter at the Davis Food CoOp.  Im one of the two females there; Im the short one with the braid.

My hair is a lot longer now.  Its grown almost six inches since I moved here.  I wonder if, despite all the nasty chemicals in Davis water, theres something that speeds up hair growth? Oh, and that picture was taken in Irvine, CA.  I need someone to take a more recent picture, one that doesnt involve beer, sausages or classical musicians.
