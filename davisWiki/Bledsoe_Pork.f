20080304 09:57:47 nbsp Ive had Bledsoes pork and lamb and they are both incredible.  I cant eat pork from the supermarket anymore because my tastebuds now know what good pork can taste like.   Users/AcMach

20081024 10:38:04 nbsp I cant say enough good things about Dan and John Bledsoe and their meat products.  In addition to pork and lamb, they also now sell 100% nothin ground beef.  It is all indescribably good.  If you were born after @1960, you probably have never tasted real pork.  The stuff from the supermarket does not begin to compare  no flavor, no texture, and full of chicken offal and other animal byproducts, hormones and antibiotics.  Bledsoe products are raised with 100% nothin.  None of the garbage.  The animals are not confined.  The beef are grass fed.  The lambs are raised on their mothers milk and grass.  The porkers are fed seed meal.  When Dan and John BLedsoe sell you a hunk of meat, they will even tell you how to cook it.  Earlier this year, Dan and John Bledsoe sold shares in beef.  We eagerly await our halfbeef!   The prices are right.  You cant go wrong!  Our Sunday family dinners `are about 80% built around Bledsoe products. Users/FreddieOakley

Now even when I do not live in Davis anymore I sometimes make trips to Davis to buy his poultry. Its juicy, flavorful and more tender than what you can get out there. Users/SimonFung
