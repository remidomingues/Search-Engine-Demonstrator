Blisworks Bikes offers quality service and sales from an experienced mechanic at a convenient location.

As an avid mountain biker and bicycle courier in Washington D.C. Sheldon entered the bicycle business with the hopes of cutting his mounting repair expenses. This was back around 1990, before suspension, when cromoly and cantilever brakes were the bomb.  He learned his craft from two great mechanics, one who was a book taught mechanic and the other was an experienced mechanic from Mexico City who could make anything work because parts were hard to come by down south. He got the best of two worlds.  He has been a wheel builder since the first bike shop he apprenticed in and hes worked and managed many bike shops over the years from City Bikes (Adams Morgan, DC) to Performance Bikes to a couple local shops and he has often been the only mechanic on staff. Blisworks Bikes works on everything from carbon rides to suspended rigs and all the steel steeds inbetween.


So come on in, check me out, I know I can help you with your bicycle woes or help you figure out what your next great bike will be!

Although we mainly sell new bikes we usually do have some quality used bikes for sale.

20110321 12:05:32 nbsp We recently needed a couple of new bikes and Sheldon helped navigate the various styles and models to find the bikes that were best for us.  He wanted us to be happy as long term customers and wasnt just looking for the quick sale.  We love our bikes and highly recommend Blisworks to anyone looking to buy a bike or getting one repaired.  Definitely check them out. Users/dkco

20110430 00:18:26 nbsp This guy is awesome.  He rebuilt the tires to my Cannondale road bike for a lot less than the other guys.  I would highly recommend this guy to anybody in Davis.  He made sure everything was alrite with my bike when I got it back. He even fixed some things the last mechanic messed up.  He was real honest too.  I actually made a mistake and was going to overpay, but then he corrected me and gave me back the extra money.   This is my new bike mechanic as long as I am in Davis or anywhere close.   Users/Lu

20110523 18:56:00 nbsp I have lived in Davis for almost 10 years and I have been a customer at many different bike shops.  Blisworks is by far the best bike shop in town.  I bought a bike here, have gone here for parts, and had my bikes serviced here.  The guy who runs it is approachable, friendly, extremely knowledgeable about bikes, and a very honest businessman.   Users/TomShapland

20110527 09:51:09 nbsp The DUNN has Dunn did it again, You can not go wrong with this guy. hes a bike NINJA and not even Chuck Norris could out wrench this guy. I once saw him true a wheel with his mind, no joke. Simply amazing.   Users/tonycoppi

20110620 16:23:22 nbsp Sheldon is one of the most knowledgeable and friendly bike mechanics I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He was a huge help in getting my bike properly adjusted so that I could enjoy my commute to work in Dixon. He was a wealth of information, and gave me the confidence get out and bike. Blisworks is the only place that I will be going for maintenance on my bike. Thanks Shell! Users/WillFennie

20110801 20:14:37 nbsp Walked into Blisworks on a whim and was happy to see Sheldon there. I knew him from Kens and he was the only guy Id trust working on my road bike.  Sheldons a crack mechanic, honest and lowkey  Id highly recommend the shop to anyone.  Users/MichaelDeNardi

20110827 08:31:31 nbsp We bought a new Kona Africabike 3 from Sheldon when we first arrived in Davis. The whole bike thing was intimidating to us as we havent had bikes in years, and we were coming to Davis from out of state. Sheldon was approachable, wasnt pushy, and he worked with us to find the exactly right bike for our needs. Thanks, Sheldon and happy riding! Users/DrewRoss

20120102 08:23:03 nbsp Needed a solid rear tire for a New Years Day ride down Mr. Toads.  Called usual shops in town but no one had more than a basic cross country tire.  Called Sheldon on a whim and even though the shop was closed for the holiday, he opened the shop up for me and had several all mountain tires available.  Bought a maxxis minion at a fair price.  Good to have a real mountain bike shop in town that also gives great service.  Had a great ride on Toads as a result, even though there was a little snow at the top. Users/EliMakus

20120421 16:36:31 nbsp We completely overhauled an old bike at this shop and the owner did an excellent job at the most competitive price in town. He also gave us great advice about purchasing bikes for our kids. Instead of getting a quick sale, he encouraged us to wait for the best bike to come in. Were heading back to get it soon!  Users/KarenV

20120526 15:15:02 nbsp Old knees giving me a hard time on my old bike. Sheldon (owner) found me a new lightweight bike that fit me perfectly  no more knee pain  and the very reasonable price didnt hurt either. Nice shop! Users/JessicaKelly

20130602 22:16:58 nbsp Not only have I always gotten excellent service from Sheldon, he also helped me jack up my car to try to retrieve my cat, who had climbed up into my engine after escaping from his cat carrier outside the veterinary clinic. (Couldnt get him to climb back down, so Sheldon helped me remove parts of my engine so we could get at the cat from above.) All of this after I knocked on his door AFTER the close of business! I cant thank or recommend him highly enough! Users/CathyYoung

20131119 22:18:28 nbsp Blisworks has great service. I dont know how their prices compare because its the only bike shop I use, but their service is fast and the employees are kind and honest. Worth going to!
