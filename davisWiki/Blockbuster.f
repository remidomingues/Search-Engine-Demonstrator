Blockbuster is a chain of video stores stores that rents DVDs and videogaming video games. There used to be 2 stores in Davis. The last store in Davis closed in April of 2011. Blockbuster also sold used videos and games (including PSP games).

The last day of rentals at the downtown store was Wednesday, 20110223. Soon after that they started selling their stock. The store closed its doors permanently in early April, although the lease expires in August. This is just coincidental with the 49er Video store closing. The Davis store was one of the most profitable, so it wasnt due to finances but due to a dispute with the landlord, Colliers International. As of March 2011, Colliers is seeking a new tenant and is asking $15,000/month lease for the 6,000 sq. ft. building.

Blockbuster stores across the U.S. stopped honoring Blockbuster gift cards after April 6, 2011. This was due to their bankruptcy proceedings. If you have an old Blockbuster gift card from the old Blockbuster company, it is now worthless.

The traditional rental system at Blockbuster was focused on due dates for rented movies. They sold memberships so you can have Movies movies for indefinite periods. They also started a monthly candy program where you could take one candy item home with any rental you make (including the 5 free swaps per month with their online rental program) for a flat fee. They also started an online Movies movie rental service in an attempt to compete with http://www.netflix.com Netflix. Blockbusters online program let you exchange 5 movies per month that theyve mailed to you for instore rentals.  During peakstore hours it could take you at least 20 minutes to get through the line.

Blockbuster has signed agreements with several major movie studios allowing them to rent newly released movies 28 days before Netflix and Redbox. Netflix and Redbox signed agreements that call for a 28 day delay before they can rent certain newly released movies. Blockbuster can rent those movies on the very first day that those movies go on sale in stores. The same 28 day advantage applies at other video rental stores.

Blockbuster was equipped with special magnetic devices that caused the security checkpoints to beep when people tried to steal discs.

They were also the most expensive Movies movie rental place in town. Try one of the other Video Stores video stores if you dont want to pay an arm and leg  because you really dont have to.

A Blockbuster location in the The Marketplace closed in April 2009.

According to http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/business/24blockbuster.html?srcbusln this article, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy on September 23rd, 2010, as the result of http://www.pennyarcade.com/comic/2011/5/30/ competition from Netflix and Redbox.  Stores will continue to operate normally, but many will likely be closed. Dish Network Corporation, the second largest satellite provider, bought Blockbuster at a bankruptcy auction in April 2011. The old Blockbuster, Inc. is no more. Dish Network intends to keep about 1,500 stores open out of the current 1,700.

Panera Bread moved into part of the old Blockbuster building in downtown in August 2012. About 2,000 square feet is open for another business.


I once rented at the Downtown store, and the gentleman behind the counter looked at me and said, You look like the sort of person who is angry all the time.  Nevermind for a moment that he was right.  Such a comment is uncalled for in polite society, especially coming from the video check out person.  I was too shocked to retort.  I suppose people think they can do anything when they work for a company that is successful even though it has always had the highest prices.  To be fair, let me add that the selection is great at Covell: they have some movies that you cant find elsewhere, especially in the foreign section (though everything there requires you to be 17+, even the cheesy Hong Kong comedies).

20060120 17:09:09 nbsp how are prices? Users/NumiaCairaguas

20060120 18:16:24 nbsp The North Davis Blockbuster once sent me to collections over a late fee of $7.42. Paid the late fee and cancelled my account on the same day, and Im never going back. Pricks. Users/BigDave

20060202 23:21:10 nbsp My boyfriend & I had an awful experience @ the N. Davis Blockbuster tonight... went in (after going to 49er when they were out of the DVD we wanted) to rent & tried to just give them the account name (I dont carry the card cuz fat cardfilled wallets  annoying), but apparently their system deletes accounts after 90 days of nonuse so they made us fill out a whole new application w/ credit cards & all...mind you, this whole time the apparent manager was being very rude and belittling his coworker, and the process took over 15 min. To make a long story less long, it was an ordeal, the manager was a jerk (kept calling my boyfriend buddy in a condescending way), was outright mean to his coworker, & the experience led to us taking back our application & leaving VERY unsatisfied. I wont go to Blockbuster again. And whats up with the 90day deletion thing?  Way to make life difficult for everyone, Blockbuster!  Go to 49er video or get Netflix...waaay better. Users/EmilyBlake

20060203 03:20:34 nbsp Numia: The prices are a shakedown.  New Releases: $4.69.  Regular: $4.49.  I rented 3 videos last week (1 New, 2 Reg) and the total came out to $13.67, before tax.  Thats a pretty shitty deal, considering I only bothered watching each movie once.  Contrast that with Netflixs $17.99 for their 3moviesat once plan, with unlimited rental time.  You can likely rent more than just 3 movies a month and it will more than make up for the initial $4.32 cost over Blockbuster.  Obviously, they charge for the convienence, but with some forethought, you wont have to deal with this bullshit. Users/JohnNapier
             Yes, the prices are very high.  I learned a lot about life when, as a young man, the first Blockbuster opened in Chico.  The rental price was twice that of the local stores, but everyone started going to Blockbuster.  In the past, the stores did have unusual items for rent, good Classics sections, etc.  This was at the beginning of the DVD revolution.  Now the selection seems less good.  It keeps trudging along, though, allegedly because of its ability to secure umpteen copies of every blockbuster Hollywood film.Users/MisterProfessor

20060701 02:16:32 nbsp The selection at the downtown store really sucks unless you are renting a new release.  They are also way too expensive.   Users/DudeNude

If you want to save money, check out blockbusters online movie rental that is comparable to Netflix. Im paying $17.99 monthly with blockbuster online service and they give you 2 free walk in rentals monthly. So, if youre between online movies...just walk in and select 2 free movies @ blockbuster. By the way, I was very pleased with the foreign & Indie selections at the Downtown location. I dont know what DudeNude is griping about.  (JoeCustomer)

20061216 13:58:44 nbsp I think its part of their corporate policy to make sure that you cant get out of there in 20 minutes or less. Ive walked in, spent 2 minutes picking out a movie, and then another 40 waiting in line, arguing with the clerk (I try and use the coupons/blockbuster rewards to save money) and then finally renting the movie. Its awful. I hate this place and am going to write the manager to tell them how awful it is. Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070121 03:02:58 nbsp I rented a movie there about 2 weeks ago and it too forever because they couldnt just call up my account, they had to call the store in San Jose to get some number and then they could rent me the movie. But eve though that was a big hassle the women who dealt with me was very friendly and kind throughout, so it wasnt so bad. Users/NathanielFurniss

20070121 13:01:40 nbsp Someone  actually a group of 3 stole the gumball machine out of the North Davis Blockbuster. And alot of there inventory dissapeared mysteriously a couple years back... Damn kids Users/StevenDaubert

20070129 00:01:16 nbsp Personally, Im a fan of Blockbuster.  Ive never had a bad experience at the North Davis one, and Ive been living about 200 yards from it for the past 4 years.  The employees have always been both friendly and helpful.  I also started doing the online service, and I love it.  $17.99/month for 3 movies out at a time, like NetFlix, but you can take those mailed DVDs back to the Blockbuster store to exchange for any rental, for free.  Basically, it nixes the turnaround time.  I do agree that Blockbusters regular rental prices are too high, and that their instore selection is mediocre.  With the online service, though, its not an issue. Users/TomGarberson

20070312 14:46:54 nbsp I dont know if anyone has the same experience as me. Hopefully not, because it is not a good experience. From the downtown blockbuster, I rented movies several times. Recently, they charged me for a movie that I returned long ago. When I asked for help in resolving the matter, they werent even that helpful. They simply said, our record shows that you didnt return. BUT I swear to God (with all due respect) that I dont have the movie. It just really upset me that I had to pay 25 dollars for a movie that I DONT even have, and this is not even the first time that this had happened. What upset me even more is that the employee there or even the manager does not try to help me the problem. I hope nothing like this ever happen to other people...because it is really upsetting to be accused of something you didnt even do. Users/CarlieYang

20070515 23:18:41 nbsp In my experience, the Downtown Blockbuster provides the worst service of any establishment in Davis (at least any that I have been to). Ive never spent less than 20 minutes standing in line regardless of how many people are actually waiting ahead of me. Most recently, I went with a couple of friends, one of whom had an account. Our check out person couldnt find the account in their computer and spent 10 minutes on the phone with the North Davis Blockbuster before she concluded that the account didnt exist at either store. We then tried to open a new account, but they were out of applications (can Blockbuster really be that popular??). The woman also mentioned something about how all of their Locksmiths bathroom keys had been stolen. Users/Ami

20070928 00:39:36 nbsp The downtown Blockbuster has had a lot of problems with people going into the bathroom with DVDs and stealing them. That is why they are not letting people into the bathrooms. Users/BrandonMinow

20070929 08:50:21 nbsp I use Netflix but occasionally use my mothers blockbuster account. I went to the North Davis location to rent a movie and they said that the credit card on the account had expired so I would have to provide a new one to continue renting. I gave them my credit card and went on my way. A few weeks later, I went to the downtown location. They told me the credit card on the account had expired and I would have to give them a new one. I told them I had just given them my card at the N. Davis a few weeks before. They said sometimes the two locations arent connected, so Id have to do it again at this location. So I did. A month later I was at the N. Davis location again. They said the credit card on the account had expired. I told them I had just renewed it two months before at that exact location. They had no explanation for me and I left without renting anything.  Users/ElleWeber

20071105 22:05:31 nbsp You would think that a company that big would have a system that was in sync with all the other stores. They make it so hard for anyone to rent movies from them. Thank you for having Netflix around, if it was not for them, I do not think I could ever step foot into another Blockbuster again.... Rude and unfriendly stafff.... Users/AC

20080120 23:19:45 nbsp My dog chewed up a DVD a few years ago, and they didnt charge me for it when I brought it back to them.  Now I rent through the online system, which is very convenient. Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080205 13:27:31 nbsp My most recent visit with the downtown store was completely hassel free. As soon as I walked in the store I was greeted by an employee who then helped me find the list of movies I was looking for. It seems their current crop of collegekids are actually on the ball. I did make the mistake of going on an ultabusy Friday night, but it must have been under two minutes before I was at the register and out the door. The employee who rang me up did need my credit card information, but kindly explained that they update every three months to keep things current. She also explained that it helped prevent charges from having to go through the collection agency (which I appreciate). I was suprised to find out that they had done away with the late fees that can accumulate very quickly at other stores. Instead, you have a sevenday grace period on your rental before the movie charges to you. Even after that, you have a chance to return the movie and have the money refunded. In total it was something like thirty seven days you get to keep it for only the rental price plus the restocking fee. Sounds good to me! Users/BusinessCritic

20080320 09:42:08 nbsp Hmmm.... Okaaaayyyy..... so I DONT think Ill be renting from Blockbuster given all that Ive read below.  The negative comments outweights the positive something like 20:1.  But truth be told, I never really liked Blockbuster anyway.  My favorite in store rental is Hollywood Video for the service and for the better selection but the closest location is in woodland.  Unfortunately, I dont have time for netflix.    Users/AnnieSirrah

20080521 18:29:21 nbsp Renting from blockbuster isnt that great, but waiting for the 3 for $20 or 4 for $20 sales to buy used DVDs is a steal. Just remember to check your disks before you leave the store, regularly they sell used DVDs that look like someone etched their name in it or something. Users/jsramahi

20080530 00:40:45 nbsp I have two complaints, one for each store.  One, happened a little earlier tonight at the marketplace store, I arrive 5 minutes before closing and yes, my clock is perfectly accurate.  Never mind the difficulty in getting there on time to exchange a blockbuster online rental which would of been very nice to have exchanged right then and there.  I was turned away, I told them they werent closed yet and they just quoted what there clock said (Which would make it maybe 10 minutes fast?  Either that or they where lying, which I think was more likely, in the end I am very unhappy.)

On to two, for the downtown store, this did not happen once, nor twice, but thrice.  I would call asking if they have a title, they first make me spell it for them 3 times, then they repeat it to me (Correctly) three time, and then spend a minute looking up the title on the computer just for them to say Nope, we dont have it.  Later, maybe a day or two I go there for another reason and I just happen to see that title they said they did NOT have right there on the shelf in plain view.  I ask them how this happened and they call me a lier.

I would very much like to have nothing to do with either store, but the so far very good blockbuster online keeps forcing me back there.  And no, not all the employees are bad, they just are never there when you need them.  If you want a good rental store go to 49er Video, cheaper and better selection.  (At least for the stuff I am interested in).

Edit:  As of now, (May 30th 2008) I take my praise for blockbuster online back, they just turned my perfectly organized queue into chaos and randomly removed 48 titles. Users/HVS

20090105 21:40:30 nbsp While Im glad that this store is here, Im not so thrilled at their selection.  Its just very small, and their selection of many genres is practically nonexistent.  I suppose its better than nothing, but those who want a good selection might be much happier using Netflix.  Also, I found that the rental prices at this store were significantly higher than other stores that Ive rented from over the past several years, although I should note that those stores were not Blockbusters, so I dont know if their prices are in line with typical Blockbuster prices. Users/IDoNotExist

20090724 11:08:07 nbsp The downtown locations selection isnt amazing a lot of the time I cant find the older movies I want, but hey, I guess thats expected. I dont like the new layout either...it doesnt make for easy scanning both because of space issues and because movies are always out of order! But I do like the employees there they may not always be chipper, but a lot of the time they chat it up with you and they always say have a great night or a similar variant of that.  Users/Kiran

20091022 01:09:04 nbsp I worked at the downtown location a few years back. All yall customers need to realize some things before you start ragging on us employees. First of all, the pay sucks, and none of us ever got a raise. Instead they kept hiring kids and each of us got less hours to work. My store manager was a total bitch and took out all her problems on us. On the other hand my assist. manager was the coolest person EVER!(Rock on Jose!) Secondly, the computer system is the WORST system I have ever used period. The computers are huge, bulky, OLD as dirt, all the wiring is completely screwed up, and we have to input everything by key commands. To put this into perceptive, I had touch screen computers when I worked at Round Table Pizza! COME ON! I remember for like a week straight our systems were down because damn roof rats chewed through all the wiring. I sat at that damn store until 3am once because of this. Thirdly, some of you customers can seriously be the worst. You think we enjoy our job? You think we enjoy having to reorganize those damn shelves every 5 min. cuz you guys cant take the 2 seconds to put the movie back in the right damn spot?? You think we enjoy having people scream at us over the phone and the counters about how they dont wanna pay the $1 overdue fine cuz they couldnt handle the responsibility of renewing or returning the movie on time?? You think we enjoy customers talking to us like we are 5 year olds because we cant find Sahib Bibi aur ghulam because we have NO idea how to even spell that and the customer cant help either?  JEEZE. People, be a little bit nicer to minimum wage employees yea!? USUALLY, we are trying our best to just work our 68 hour shifts and get the hell home and study for that physics exam the next morning too. And for petes sake, its just a movie! Users/allwalksoflife87

  a fine example of an employee who should have been (if you werent already) fired. I also used to work at the Blockbuster in Downtown Davis and was dealing with the same issues but in a completely different light. I was fired, along with thousands of others who were making more than $10.00 per hour and won a class action lawsuit against the company to boot, but even with all of that... even knowing all the bad about the company... I feel the worst would have been working with an unappreciative, disrespectful brat like yourself. Learn how to spell, learn how to appreciate the customers (without whom you would have no job) and start to understand that customer service means a lot of detail work and a bit of compassion to boot. You have proven the  http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Internet_Fuckwad_Theory theory.  Users/WesP

20101010 01:39:46 nbsp It feels like the video games are never updated. Ive gone into this Blockbuster so many times, just to see the same old video games. Sometimes they do have a newer game, but they only keep like 3 copies so youll never get to rent it until it gets really old.  Users/ThUn
  Blockbuster is probably spending very little money right now, having declared bankruptcy last month.  Depending how many games you rent, you might want to look into GameFly.  I think theyre around $15 or 16/month for one game at a time, which is somewhere around the cost of two games from Blockbuster month.  I only ever did one month with them, but I got two new releases during that time. Users/TomGarberson

20101022 18:42:31 nbsp Steer clear of the computer they have for customers unless you want your credit card info stolen. I used it to sign up for a free 2week Blockbuster Online trial which requires you to list your credit card info. A few days later my bank informed me that fraudulent charges were going on my credit card. The card I used was a Visa CheckCard which I normally only use as a Debit card so I am 100% positive that the Blockbuster computer was the culprit. The computer in question is running an older version of Internet Explorer and Windows XP (probably without malware protection). I was weary of inputting my data into this computer in the first place but the lure of free movies overrode my better judgement. This is a warning to others so that you can aviod the trouble of having your credit card info stolen. Users/GabeLarke

20110305 08:49:55 nbsp The claim that blockbuster is one of the most expensive stores was something I believed for a while, but recently all of their blurays were 2.99 which was way cheaper than 49er and had significantly more selection than redbox.   Users/RohiniJasavala



20100330 08:11:00 nbsp Previously viewed DVDs are now 3.99!!! which is a pretty good deal on the new releases and old classics! Users/DeeO

20110420 00:07:42 nbsp Be warned: When I visited to buy some DVDs during their liquidation sale, the workers invited me to sign up for a free onemonth trial of the Blockbuster mailing service. They specifically told me I would receive a reminder email to cancel my account when the free trial was over. Well, that email never came and although I suspended my account the day of the new billing period, they billed my credit card anyway. I called Blockbuster for a refund and it seems it will be straightened out (am still waiting for refund to show up on my credit card account), but I shouldnt have had to call them in the first place. So if any of you signed up for the free trial as well, dont forget to cancel it because Blockbuster sure wont remind you as they promised. Users/MeggoWaffle
