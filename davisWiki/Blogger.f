Image(markblog.jpg, Blogger of Davis Wiki user Users/MarkKlebanov, 300, thumbnail) Blogger, owned by Google, is yet another web publishing (Blogging) service.  Competition includes LiveJournal and Xanga.  Blogger is notorious for being used by professors, scholars and political activists.

A benefit to those using Blogger as opposed to LiveJournal or Xanga is the ability to do extreme customizations.  There is little to no limitations to how a Blogger can look.  Anyone with great XML and CSS skills can turn a Blogger from a boring white page into something flashy and jumpy.

The downside to using Blogger is the lack of blogger users coming together through the service(found on LiveJournal in the form of Communities and on Xanga in the form of Blogrings).  Blogger users improvise with Blogrolls, a side column that allows bloggers to list other blogs they read.

Present on the pages of free Blogger users is a Blogger bar.  This Blogger bar is customizable in four colors to fit the skin of the Blog.  HTML and CSS codes have been developed that allow desparate Blogger users to hide the Blogger bar from their website, though its not usually recommended since the Blogger bar is the main source of Blogger revenue.  Premium paid users of Blogger do not have the Blogger bar.

Unlike Xanga and LiveJournal where the service name is followed by the username in web addresses, Blogger usernames are followed by BlogSpot instead of Blogger.  Before all the formerly premium services became free when Google bought Blogger, Blogspot designated the accounts of those who opted out of using the premium services.

Bloggers parent company, Google, also owns Picasa, a popular photo sort and collage program among amateur and professional photographers.
