http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog (From Wikipedia) A weblog, which is usually shortened to blog, is a type of website where entries are made (such as in a journal or diary), displayed in a reverse chronological order. Blogs often provide commentary or news on a particular subject, such as food, politics, or local news; some function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although many focus on photographs, videos or audio. Blogs are sometimes integrated with Podcasts, which automatically download episodes of audio or video (Vidcasts) material.
