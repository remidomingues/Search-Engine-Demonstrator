BloodSource is a nonprofit blood center that collects donated blood from Volunteer volunteers at their many locations as well as from regular blood drives conducted on campus and in the nearby area.  The Davis BloodSource center is also somehow extremely well connected, being one of only two blood providers that was able to get usable blood to New York the very day of September 11th.

BloodSource is clean and bright and frequently decorated with seasonal themes. The staff are all very pleasant and accommodating, clients donating plasma have a nice selection of movies to watch while they donate. The snacks after donation are plentiful.

Appointments are easy to make. Simply call them up on the phone and arrive on time. If theyre not busy, they will accept walkins, but making an appointment is more efficient. Many potential donors wrongly feel discouraged from donating because they erroneously assume they dont qualify (due to Drugs illicit drug use, for example). If youre one of these potential donors, dont be afraid: simply walk in and ask if you can donate.

There is currently a shortage of blood in the country. This is due in part to one of the most reliable sources of public blood, the military, having to keep its donors to replenish their own reserves. Aside from the military, college and high school students are one of the most important demographics for blood donations, since they tend to be the most eligible and healthy. Save a life. Give blood!
