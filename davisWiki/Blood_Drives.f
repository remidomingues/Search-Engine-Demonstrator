Blood Drives are often held by BloodSource. There are usually fun incentives for a pint of your human juice. A tee shirt mostly, with a pack of coupons, but sometimes you can get Give a Pint, Get a Pint where youll get a free 12 oz. container of ice cream at Baskin Robbins. They also give free snacks to help you recuperate while you remain for the ten minute observation, including Fluffy Donuts.  If you wish to hold a blood drive, contact BloodSource and they will be more than happy to provide you with information.


Donating Blood

To give blood you must weight over 110 pounds, and have a photo ID showing you are 17 years of age or older (or 16 with parental consent).  You wont be allowed to donate if youve been feeling sick in the last 48 hours.  Other restrictions, such as recent urban body piercings or tattoos, will stop you from being able to donate.  See BloodSource BloodSources http://www.bloodsource.org/HowYouCanHelp/DonateBlood/Commonly_asked_question.cfm FAQ for other restrictions.

A quick summary is that you may not give whole blood if you:

      Have had hepatitis after age ten.
      Have severe heart problems.
      Are pregnant or have been pregnant in the last six weeks.
      Visited a one of the foreign countries on a list provided at the testing site within a given time frame that verys between the countries
      Are HIV positive or are classed by the FDA as being in a high risk group, defined as:
       Having ever done illegal IV drugs.
       Having hemophilia or other conditions that require treatment with clotting factors.
       Being a man who had sex with another man after 1977.
       Having had sex for money or drugs after 1977.
       Having had sex with any individual who falls into any of the above four categories within the past 12 months.
       Are donating blood in order to test yourself for HIV.
      Had leukemia, melanoma or myeloma (other cancers are subject to various regulation; superficial or cancers in remission generally do not disqualify a person).

Causeway Classic Blood Drive

The Causeway Classic is an annual, friendly competition started in 2008 between UC Davis and Sacramento State to register the most donors and collect the most pints over two days.

The winning school enjoys their name on a trophy and bragging rights for a year.

20070822 23:17:02 nbsp I think that banning gay men who have engaged in sexual activity once or more times since 1977 is just plain idiotic.  They dont ban people from giving blood for having unprotected sex, however a commited monogomous couple that always practices safer sex can not donate.  Actually there have been cases where gay mens blood/organs were refused and sick people died as a result (because the gay person had a very rare blood type, or were a very good match for the organ).  It should also be noted that this is very specific to US law and most industialized countries do not have these restrictions Users/MattHh
