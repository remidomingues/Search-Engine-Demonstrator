Blue Elephant Used Furniture was a furniture stores furniture store that operated only briefly in Davis. It was located at 213 E Street. Many of the furniture pieces were antique, and the stock was generally in really good condition. The pieces were arranged in such a way that lent the place a cozy atmosphere fit for the Victorian elite. Despite very reasonable prices and the attractive setup, Blue Elephant became yet another local business to fall victim to the poor economy of 2011. Rest in peace, Blue Elephant, for your trunk(s) will be fondly remembered.
