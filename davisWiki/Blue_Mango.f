The Blue Mango Restaurant was a vegetarian restaurant located on G Street G St in the 1980s.  It was collectively owned by the workers. It was open Tuesday to Sunday, with Mondays for general or team meetings, maintenance, and hanging out. In Robert Crumbs book My Troubles with Women he visits the Blue Mango.

There was an open mic evening.  A longtime host was Jan Peters.  Hes a special guest performer with Andrew Corbett in concert at the Odd Fellows Hall at 7:30 pm on Saturday November 19, 2011.

Often performing for dinner were musicians Bob and Donna Wren.  (Robert Crumb also did a caricature of Bob.)

The Blue Mango Revival 30 Year Anniversary will be held at the Odd Fellows Ballroom on October 24, 2009 at 7 PM. Celebrating old values & new beginnings with food made from original Mango recipes, storytelling, live music and dancing.

David Carey began his musical career in the 1960s in a New Jersey high school rock band with future rock star Joe Walsh, and later toured the world as a guitarist with the U.S. Navy Band. Ken and David first collaborated 30 years ago as musicians in the Fly By Night Dance & Music Troupe. In October 1979 Ken (on piano) and David (as drummer) opened the Blue Mango Restaurant & Coffee House in Davis as the original house band, with Julie Partansky on trumpet & Tom Arons on clarinet.

The Woodland Food Coop was being organized around this time, and at one of our August Board meetings, amidst all our own crises, we found time to grant them copurchase privileges so they could buy food at wholesale to sell at the Woodland Farmers Market. The Blue Mango restaurant, a workers collective several of our members were involved in starting, also opened on October 1st. October also saw our first newspaper advertising of the Coop. The new store area was finished by the end of the month. I was given the job of Communications Coordinator and began putting out the Coop newsletter OIKOS, which hadnt been published since about May.
