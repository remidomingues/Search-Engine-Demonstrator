The Blue Moon Literary & Art Review publishes fiction and poetry of all genres, from serious fiction to murder mystery. We are especially interested in short stories and excerpts from novels in progress, and we are dedicated to high quality, interesting and unusual works. We hope the Review will be entertaining and thought provoking; however, we have no political agenda, only a strong desire to promote and publish fine writing. In addition to works of fiction, we also invite for consideration reviews of art, books, and plays, as well as literary essays of any kind.

While we are a new publication, we hope to grow over the years as we promote and encourage new writers from all over the world. In these early years of production, we request that writers submit their work with a stamped, selfaddressed envelope (and a small Readerâ€™s Fee of $10.00 if you would like a written critique, made payable to Blue Moon Literary & Art Review, in order to defray the expenses associated with reading and considering each submission).

The Fall 2009 Issue 4 is available in Davis at the Avid Reader, Newsbeat, John Natsoulas Center for the Arts, and Konditorei Austrian Pastry Cafe.  In Sacramento, copies may be found at Newsbeat located at 1050 20th Street. The next volume will be published in Spring 2010.

Our goal is to lead the literary life and to enable others to lead it with us. Good writing, like fine wine, is best shared and appreciated as a communal experience.
