Blue Oak Energys mission is to transform the ways we generate electricity by making sustainable solar energy widely accessible. Blue Oak Energy has engineered and constructed solar electric systems on over 600 distinct locations across more than 30 states in the US. The work they have completed has added more than 500MW of clean renewable energy to the utility grid which will produce energy for 30 years or more. Their success is a direct result of our dedicated and talented technical team who work solely on commercial and utility solar facilities.

Recent projects include a comprehensive roofmounted PV and solar carport design package for the Google Campus headquarters in Mountain View.

They were formerly located at 4614 Second Street. The move allowed them to expand in size.
