Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) are a native to the eastern and southern United States. They can be found in most Sacramento River drainages and once inhabited the Arboretum Waterway.  Rest assured they are indeed there. Bluegill are fun to Fishing introduce people to the sport of angling, and will accept most small live baits and chase down smaller lures. They feed primarily on aquatic insects, small mollusks, tiny fish and crustaceans. Have fun Bluegillin!
