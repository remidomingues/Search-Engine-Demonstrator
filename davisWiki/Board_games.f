Board games are a popular pastime in Davis, since there is little else to do here besides studying (if you are part of the students student class) or infrastructural upkeep (if you are part of the managerial class) (cf. Keep Davis Boring). Although board games still primarily appeal to the nearly extinct species of bookreading thinkers here in America (the nerds of yore), they are much more sophisticated and challenging today than they were in past times (excluding chess, Go, and roleplayinggames). It remains to be seen whether board games can compete with online Videogaming video games, chat rooms, iPodification, and entertainment televisionactivities that aggressively purloin attention to the point of near complete hebetationbut hope is always on the horizon. Also, for those falling behind in their studies or dissipating through the daily grind, board games can easily become drinking games (if youre into Alcohol that sort of thing).

 Board Games in American Society 

When you were young (assuming you were American), you probably played board games like Monopoly, Life, Risk, Stratego, and others.  Did you know that Monopoly was created in 1903, Risk and Stratego both in 1959, and Life in 1860?!?  As you can imagine, board game technology has advanced quite a bit since then.  And yet American parents are still buying these games for their kids, exclusively, because they dont know any better.

The popular American board games (also known as Family Games or Classic Board Games) typically have a turn mechanism that goes something like this: 1) Roll a pair of dice. 2) Move. 3) Do what the board says, or take an action based on where you land. This allows for a limited amount of strategy; as a result, games like Monopoly and Life are principally luckdriven and have limited appeal for adults.

More complex and interesting board games, known as GermanStyle Board Games, Designer Games, or Advanced Board Games have existed since the 60s.  They are typically sold in specialty shops.  Avalon Hill produced an immense number of these games during the 1960s and 1970s (the pinnacle being Cosmic Encounter in 1978), then struggled in the 1980s before they were acquired by Hasbro in 1998.  In fact, Hasbro owns almost all of the major American board game companies today: Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, Hasbro Interactive, and a lot of other toyrelated brands.  Perhaps the fact that almost all of the games come from the same company helps explain why there is so little variation on the shelves of the typical American toy store, such as ToysRUs (or the games asile of WalMart).

While in the US during the 1980s and 1990s boardgames were stagnating (with a few exceptions, such as Axis and Allies in 1984), in Europe they were starting a renaissance.  Contrasted with most Americans, who often view boardgames as something for children and spend most of their leisure time watching TV, Europeans are typically more inclined toward activities that promote family interaction, and boardgames often fulfill this role. As a result, Europeans began producing deep, challenging, strategic games that could be enjoyed by the entire family.

 Designer Board Games 

By far the most successful Germanstyle board game or designer board game is http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13 The Settlers of Catan, released in 1995.  Originally a German game released by Kosmos, it was licensed and released in the US by Mayfair Games and gained a cult following here. Settlers was designed by Klaus Teuber, a german dental technitian who designed games as a hobby. The game was so popular in Germany that it won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres (German family game of the year award), primarily because of its appeal to both gamers and nongamers alike.

In Settlers of Catan, players compete to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn, dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Victory points accumulate when players build civilizations using collected raw materials; when enough points are accumulated, the game is won.  Settlers now has two major expansion packs and has spawned a number of spinoff games.


Also released in 1995 was http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/93 El Grande, where players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. These powerful lords vie for control of the various provinces by drafting caballeros (knights) into their courts and placing them on the board to exert influence over the province.  At the end of three scoring rounds, whoever has the most points is declared the winner.

The release of Settlers really opened up the floodgates, and a whole new crop of game designers entered the field with bold ideas for new games, with a few marquee titles released each year.  1997 saw the release of http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/42 Tigris and Euphrates (brought to the US by Mayfair games) and http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/11 Bohnanza, the bean trading card game.  1998 brought Reiner Knizias excellent http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3 Samurai.  1999 brought http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/91 Paths of Glory.  In 2000, the field finally hit critical mass, and a whole slew of great games started coming out each year.

Amongst the most popular of these include: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/555 Princes of Florence (2000) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/822 Carcassone (2000) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3076 Puerto Rico (2002) (consistantly voted the best board game) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/4098 Age of Steam (2002) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3307 Wallenstein (2002) (English version being released soon) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5404 AmunRe (2003) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2651 Power Grid (2004) http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209 Ticket to Ride (2004)

These games deviate heavily from the classic American board games.  Luck generally plays a much smaller role, and there are more rules to learn upfront.  The rules are generally simple, but they combine in interesting ways, introducing an element of complexity traditionally lacking in American games.

20100219 13:29:45 nbsp Does anyone happen to know if there are any copies of the classic Avalon Hill http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization Civilization around, either for sale or showing up to potluck game nights?  Note that this is different from Advanced Civilization and Sid Meiers Civilization: The Board Game.  It was by far my favorite game growing up.  Beat the pants off of Axis and Allies, Samurai Swords, and all that jazz.  Ive heard Puerto Rico and Tigris & Euphrates capture a little bit of the same feel, but Id really love to find the original.

My brother and I rebuilt the expansion from blown up downloaded photos printed out and laminated, and that sort of thing, but its a pretty lengthy process. Users/TomGarberson

20100219 14:32:48 nbsp An original copy of Civilization is a collectors item these days and they sell for about $150$200. Users/DagonJones
  Heh... OK, maybe Ill be doing some printing and laminating after all, if I ever get around to it.  I think our old copy is off with my brother in Switzerland. tg

20100309 19:13:06 nbsp I have both, but I find Adv Civ to be preferred. :) Users/JeffWood

20120205 01:52:33 nbsp Does anyone know anywhere to play Go the board game except the club? The clubs meeting time & location is not good for me.  Also is there a GO board game club on campus? Users/MinchengZhou
