Boating can be a bit challenging within Davis because there are so few large bodies of water within city limits  most of the water in town is suitable only for paddle boating handlaunched vessels. Typically, rowing sculls and power boating must be done outside of Davis. Despite the dearth of suitable locations for the various types of boating, it remains a popular activity within our populace, so here we attempt to provide a listing of nearby waterways in which to boat.

20051116 10:27:08 nbsp I wonder how paddling and boating should work together. Right now theyre very similar but I guess that they can stay seperate if they both get more information. In the future we might have a motor boating page, a paddling page, a waterskiing page, .... Users/JackHaskel
 Seems like paddling, motorboating, sailing, etc. ought to be subsets of boating.

20060605 19:24:51 nbsp I recommend Tower Park in the Sacramento Delta, it can be reached on HWY 12 from either end of the Delta. A campground, secluded inlet with docks, and a launch ramp not too far away. Users/KarlMogel
