While it is located in greater Sacramento, Bobs is the closest butcher that is certified kosher. The nearest kosher butcher after that is in Oakland.  They may also be the only local supplier of celery flavored Dr. Browns soda.

Bobs is pretty small, but has a deli counter, groceries, and a few, maybe ten, seats. As with all Ethnic Markets specialty markets, check the dates on all products. Its likely youre the first person in two years to purchase a given product.



   Wow! Someone besides me thought this was important enough to list here. What makes Bobs so interesting to you?  Users/KenBloom
   Its a link on the Ethnic Markets page I just created. As a native Long Islander, I get cravings for jewish food very often and try to hit this place when I can. I once drove 30 minutes to Bobs, only to realize it was a Saturday. Oops! Users/CraigBrozinsky
   Thanks!  Ive been looking for a good Jewish deli since I moved to California.  Next time I head to Sac, this is a absolute must stop.  Users/JabberWokky, who worked in Boca Raton, FL.
   If you want a good sitdown Jewish Deli/Restaurant, I would recommend you go to http://www.saulsdeli.com/ Sauls in Berkeley. Theyve got excellent pastrami.  Users/CraigBrozinsky
