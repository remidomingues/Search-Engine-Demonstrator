Bob Aaronson is the City of Davis Police Ombudsman who reviews police misconduct stories complaints against the Davis Police Department.  He is the first individual to hold the position after its creation in the summer of 2006.

Bob is also the parttime Independent Police Auditor in the City of Santa Cruz.  As well, he does personnel investigations for some departments, is legal advisor to others and sometimes even represents peace officers when they get in trouble(!).  I believe that fairness means you are capable of uniformly applying the law, no matter what side youre on.  Hes worked in over two hundred California departments, in one capacity or another.  He fancies himself a troublemaker.  While hes already made trouble in Santa Cruz, only time will tell in Davis.

His Davis office is at 604 Second Street, but he isnt there much.  His office office (!) is in Palo Alto, at 3565 El Camino Real, 94306.  If you want to write to him, thats a good way to do it.  If you call him, hell make an appointment to meet facetoface the next time hes in town.

His local phone number, which he checks once a week, is 5307575546.  His Palo Alto number, which is a safer bet, is 6505658800.
