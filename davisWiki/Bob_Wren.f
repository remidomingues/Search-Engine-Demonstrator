Bob has been a serious Davis musician.

When he and his girlfriend Donna moved to Davis nearly thirty years ago Julie Partansky helped them get a little place to stay.

They performed often.  One of the early places was the Blue Mango. Just one mention is at Vocal Art Ensemble.

They played for tips at the Davis Farmers Market.

He is a music instructor at Sacramento City College.

Robert Crumb once did a sketch of him titled Doesnt Give A F___.
