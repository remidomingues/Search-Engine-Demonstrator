20071029 10:53:40 nbsp One of the best massages Ive ever had (I got a 1 hour table massage). Im a bit of a massage junkie, and have been to ~10 different massage therapists over the years. This Therapist really knows her stuff. The combination of deep tissue and energy work really worked wonders for me. Users/annlewis
