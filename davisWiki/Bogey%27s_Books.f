Bogeys Books (New, Used and Out of Print Books) was a wonderful little independent Bookstores bookstore located in the heart of Downtown.  It closed in January 2008, after running a closing sale for a number of weeks.

Why would you go to Borders if you can find your book here?  Borders doesnt even smell like books!  By and large their books are cheaper than those found at Borders, largely because most of the books they carry are used. Being a used bookstore, they also buy books  every day from 10am to 3pm. They also carry some new(er) books, including fairly recent releases that have been discounted/marked down a bit from what you might find in a new books bookstore. In fact, Bogeys always sells below list, and if youre a member of a book club or otherwise need several copies of a book, ask about Bogeys volume discount. As an independent used books bookstore, Bogeys complements The Avid Reader, which carries new books. On the display tables by the fiction shelves youll often find lesserknown or underrated fiction works that are often quite good.

They have a surprisingly good art and history collection.

Along with just about every other independent Bookstores bookseller in Davis, the owner of Bogeys books, Mark Nemmers, was http://www.gallerybooks.com/bkm/bkm70703.htm quite active in fighting the establishment of Borders. The Next Chapter went so far as relocating from Davis to Woodland in direct protest of Borders Borders arrival.

20051130 21:45:26 nbsp Since 2002, Bogeys has lost at least $400 of my business because they make it hard for me to pay them.  They only take cash, VISA, and MasterCard  no ATM/debit cards, and no AmEx.  Even with a VISA or MC, theyve declined in the past to sell me ~$15 worth of books because it was too small an amount to justify the use of the credit card.  Just tonight, I changed a $44 transaction to a $31 transaction (by skipping a book) because I was $1.50 short on cash and they wouldnt take ATM or AmEx.  At this point, Im more and more likely to simply order online from Powells.  I miss Bookshop Santa Cruz! Users/GrahamFreeman

20051222 20:59:19 nbsp Despite their lack of ATM/Debit card service, I will contend that Bogeys is the best bookstore Davis has to offer. Users/EyadDarras

20051222 22:22:32 nbsp The opportunity to buy books knowing that the profits will not fly off to a corporate office god knows where is too good to pass up. Users/KenjiYamada

20051229 08:26:12 nbsp Local stores  good.  Not being able to find what you want  bad.  This store is great when Im not looking for anything in particular, and horrible when I am.  The selection of used fiction books is nice. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060102 21:39:24 nbsp AmEx is expensive compared to other cards, but it is relatively cheap compared to the rates they used to charge.  Notice that AmEx is popping up just about everywhere now as they scramble the get the ordinary joe market share, instead of just the elitist one.  But anyway, virtually al ATM cards support the Visa/MC network, so use that instead.  And if you dont have one, well, thats your loss.  After all, it is legal to pass on surcharges from ATM cards to customers, but not so for credit card networks.  And also, there is a little bit of fuzziness whether a minimum purchase is allowed under the Visa/Mastercard contract, but many authorities are increasingly saying no, which is why no large retailer has a minimum purchase.  And honestly, at the end of the day, credit card transactions, even small ones, are less expensive in terms of labor costs than dealing with cash (if you you consider the difficulty of running reports on transactions and also the cost of losing cash). Users/JaimeRaba

20060102 22:34 nbsp One neednt be elitist in order to appreciate quality of service.  The fact that Ive received consistently good service from AmEx is why Ive stuck with them.  But, I know from firsthand experience that AmEx is expensive from the vendors point of view, and while I still think it makes good business sense to make it easy for your customers to pay you I can understand why small businesses often balk at AmExs terms.

With regard to VISA/MCtied ATM cards, Im of the opinion that theyre too risky.  Im not comfortable with the prospect of someone being able to empty my personal checking account simply by stealing my VISA/MC number.  Sure, my liability is limited to $50 if I report fraudulent charges promptly, but why should I have to risk being out any amount of money, or having to deal with that situation at all?   With a conventional credit card, the credit card issuer doesnt get my money until the bill is completely correct.

So, since Ive had such a dramatically better experience with AmEx than with any of the four VISA/MC issuers Ive dealt with, and because there are ethical alternatives (e.g. Bookshop Santa Cruz, the best locallyowned bookstore in NorCal, or Powells Books, the best locallyowned bookstore in the Western U.S.) that are willing to accept my money on my terms, Bogeys Books is the party losing out in this situation.  Since theyre a local bookstore Id like to help them succeed, but Im not going to carry around extra cash just because one of every ten places I visit doesnt take AmEx or ATM.  Users/GrahamFreeman

20060124 16:34:35 nbsp Interesting comments from Graham.  My experience with AMEX is the opposite.  I think the key to good Visa/MC service is credit unions.  mine is fantastic.   Users/RocksandDirt
  20060326 00:25:56 nbsp Well, AmEx are being scummy in a dispute I currently have with Vonage, but otherwise theyve been great for the last 7 years.  I like credit unions (both as a concept and as a practical matter), but my experiences with their credit card offerings has not been positive.  (Drawing from experiences with Golden 1 and Bay Federal Credit Union) Users/GrahamFreeman

20060321 17:00:42 nbsp I would like to stick to the topic and just say that this is one of my favorite bookstores to go when you just want to browse and look up books on your mental list of things to browse. I think its a great little store. As for the credit card discussion above, I think that being the small place they are they just arent obliged to offer this as a service and I think it only reflects how spoiled we can get as consumers. I am glad that in their own way BBs is not contributing to the credit mongers ready to sign peoples lives away with interest fees. I hope they keep it people friendly like they are already! Users/LookyLoo
  20060326 00:25:56 nbsp A big part of my complaint is that, as of when I last checked, Bogeys wont take an ATM/debit card as payment unless said ATM/debit card has VISA/MC (credit card) functionality.  Isnt that actually encouraging the use of credit cards, in this case?  Id really like to be able to pay them straight out of my checking account without needing to carry cash or write a check.  I would happily pay $0.20 per transaction to do so.  Users/GrahamFreeman

20060524 23:37:34 nbsp Ive made some remarkable finds at Bogeys...I guess thats one of the benefits they enjoy, being the only fulltime used bookshop in a college town.  Ive never been able to leave the store without buying something.  (And theyre not stingy with the Bogeys bookmarks.)  Have to admit I get a kick out of eavesdropping on the clerks whenever they start testing each others knowledge of foreign languages. Users/DukeMcAdow

20060728 13:46:31 nbsp Bogeys is a great downtown bookstore, but theres another, YES!, another down by the CoOp: Sweet Briar Books.  Im not sure what full time means, but theyre open every day... Users/EmilyFriend
  I guess full time is a little oddsounding! I meant that almost all of their stock is used (though I know they sell a few new).  Some stores have a shelf or two of used, but primarily stock new books. Users/DukeMcAdow

20060925 13:31:53 nbsp Yes, I forgot to mention that: Sweet Briar is also a used bookstore.  Everything is either used or discounted, much like Bogeys.  There are hidden treasures all over this town. Users/EmilyFriend

20061005 16:40:46 nbsp Walking past Bogeys this afternoon I noticed a Bookstore For Sale sign in the window. Users/SteveGreen

20070122 09:51:43 nbsp A bookstore without a website?! This is 2007! Users/SteveDavison
 Unless a bookstore sells a lot of books to people over the internet, like http://www.powells.com/ Powells, there is not much need for a website. A used bookstore can reach more customers through the http://www.abebooks.com/ Advanced Book Exchange and all they need is a computer inventory. Im not sure if Bogeys even has that, though. Also, I read in the Chronicle a while ago that Powells buys the inventory of most used bookstores that close on the West Coast, so they will probably get Bogeys if nobody buys the store. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070217 19:18:03 nbsp A note re: Sweet Briar books  a bit of history  they were the only bookstore to NOT protest Borders. The Next Chapter was the best act in town when they were still in Davis  incredibly knowledgable staff and highquality books. Their store in Woodland is hard to access without a car. Users/JeaninePfeiffer

20070314 21:13:49 nbsp Does Bogeys still have D&D and other roleplaying/gaming books? They used to have a fairly good selection, but I havent seen any in there in forever... Users/AaGg

20070505 13:42:32 nbsp The proprietor is a good magician, and usually has a trick or two behind the counter for those who inquire.   Not likely to find that at Big Box Boox. Users/Easan

20071105 12:30:38 nbsp The building has a for lease sign.  They are closing because rent went way up and couldnt find a buyer.  Users/BarryAllard

20071106 12:07:15 nbsp I need to make a slight correction to BarryAllards post...the reason the store is closing has less to do with the rent increase than with the owners desire to move into a different phase of life. Hes been doing this for 17.5 years and needs a change. Rent increase or not, the store would be closing. My wife and I were going to buy the shop (Ive worked there since 2001) and came up against the rent increase, forcing us to back out. So, yes, its a factor, but the landlords made their decision well after the owner had decided to sell/close the business.

As an employee of the shop, Ive come to love Daviss reading community. Youre some of the nicest and most intellectually curious and stimulating folks Ive ever met. Ill miss seeing you in the store surrounded by all those books, all those ideas, opinions, and even the occasional tirade about something or other that happens to be in the air around us. Be well, and thanks for so many unforgettable evenings.

20071112 18:42:00 nbsp Bogeys is having a huge sale where everything is 20% off and some books are marked off a lot more. They said they would be closing December 31st. Users/davistudent

20071125 18:43:46 nbsp I havent been in Bogeys much...Ive gone the Avid or Sweet Briar route, though for no particular reason. Well, I finally went into Bogeys now that theyre closing down. I felt overwhleming sadness knowing that such a great place has existed right under my nose and now that I have discovered it, it is only a short time before it is gone forever. Damn internet driving bookstores out of business...

p.s. Bought a great Tao book by Osho.
p.p.s I love the specificity in how the books are categorized. Sweet Briar has a similar method. Users/EliseKane
 What makes you think the Internet is driving book stores out of business? Two factors I heard the cashier mention to somebody else when I was there the other night were the landlords raising the rent and the owners wanting to get out of the business. The Internet is actually helping a lot of used bookstores through sites like http://www.abebooks.com/ Advanced Book Exchange, although they cant help Bogeys because they dont have a constant computer inventory. I agree with you that they and Sweet Briar Books Sweet Briar have a really good selection. Anyway, dont jump to conclusions.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20071208 06:06:43 nbsp I was sorry when Bogeys closed, but dont forget that independent bookstores still exist in Davis. My personal favorite is Sweet Briar Books, on G Street in the same plaza as the Food Coop.

Its similar to Bogeys in a lot of ways. They buy and sell used books, and, for that reason, have incredibly low prices. Ive bought paperbacks in excellent condition for only a couple of dollars.

And their selection of music CDs is incomparableespecially for lovers of jazz standards like myself. Ive bought several twodisc collections there, each for under ten dollars.

So, while its sad to see bogeys close, we Davis lovers of independent bookstores still have plenty to rejoice. Users/bobby.stonewaller

20080115 00:27:20 nbsp I guess my Bogeys bookmarks are mementos, now. :( Users/DukeMcAdow

20080220 00:51:30 nbsp You are missed! Users/booklover

20090102 22:15:12 nbsp Scratching my head trying to figure out what ArthurFrane was nitpicking about.  At the time, Powells wouldnt take their inventory because of the market conditions.  Used book stores have been closing everywhere except Russia because of online, Borders, McWally World, etc. as well.  Regardless, Bogeys is missed and its a shame people only buy whats shiniest and pushed in front of them.  Support your local library.  Cheers. Users/BarryAllard
