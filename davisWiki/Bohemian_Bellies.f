In the Fall of 2004, 13 women gave birth to a new bellydance troupe they named http://www.bohemianbellies.com bohemian bellies.  This Yolo County based community group performs under the direction of Yvette Corvo Misner.

Our dancers have anywhere from 8 months to 6 years of bellydance experience and include ladies from high school to career women and moms.  Over half perform other dance forms.

We are dedicated to sharing our love of this ancient dance form with public and private audiences in the Yolo County area and beyond. Our music selections range from traditional Greek to techno remixes of Middle Eastern classics. The troupe performs mainly as a whole, bringing to life an exciting and colorful world of tummy rolls, shimmies, veils and finger cymbals.
