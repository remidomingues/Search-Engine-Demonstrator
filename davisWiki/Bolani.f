The most addictive thing to come out of Afghanistan since opium.  Bolani means filled bread in Farsi.  It is a thin flatbread baked with vegetables in them. They are lowcalorie, lowcarb, lowfat, and lowsodium; but they are nutritionally dense and sustainable and can be served as a whole meal in itself.  Best of all, they are deliciously addictive.

In the US, East & West Gourmet Afghan Food is the only trademarked manufacturer of Bolani. They sell at the Davis Farmers Market Farmers Market.

20051023 23:08:49 nbsp i told u ppl. i didnt put down all the information at first because i was still eating it Users/ApolloStumpy

20051024 07:36:02 nbsp Unless Im mistaken, I thought I saw a second place selling them at a recent Farmers Market. Ill take note next time. Users/SteveDavison

20051024 21:48:49 nbsp My roommate and I bought some and put it in the fridge. It was much less delicious. Eat it fresh.  Users/JenniferEllis

20051224 16:54:09 nbsp If you dont like it cold, I would recommend toasting it in an oven, or sauteing it (using butter, margarine, canola oil, etc.) or even grilling it.  Microwaving doesnt come out very well.   Users/BigtimeNerd

20051224 20:51:03 nbsp They are definitely tasty, but as far as half that filling you up, well I just had a whole and then had a bowl of ravioli so I wouldnt be hungry. A nice appetizer though. Users/SteveDavison

20060419 18:18:12 nbsp The dude that sells bolani and dips is awesome.  I was waiting for a friend and he kept handing me sample after sample!  The spinach bolani is really good.  Get some! Users/IasriIsrin

20060424 11:19:15 nbsp I tried the spinach bolani with the sun dried tomato dip and it was okay.  Nothing special.  It was also expensive for the amount you get and it did not fill me up.  I liked it enough that Id eat it again if someone else was paying, but I wont be purchasing any more myself. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070328 14:25:39 nbsp One of the guys, he is the one who comes on wednesday nights his name is Mustafa (sp?) and he rocks! After I bought bolani a couple times my fiance and I became regulars and Mustafa would give us an extra container of this or that every time we came to the market. They will treat you really well if you buy from them and talk to them enough that they can start to recognize you. Bolani and all of the sauces are really yummy, filling, and worth the money! Users/ColinWard

20080209 11:05:08 nbsp so many samples! indeed, the guy at the stand at farmers market is very generous with samples (if you stand there he will keep handing you different combinations of their dips and bolani). honestly the spinach bolani is filling to me but maybe thats just me, either way i find it pretty delicious.
 Users/MiranPark

20080320 04:59:54 nbsp They hand over the sample first and talk later. Its the best way to do business at a place like Farmers Market. Not that Im complaining, but I think its the free samples that drive up the price when you actually buy some. Totally worth either way. I just wish they accepted cards. Users/scrizer

20080608 00:17:10 nbsp heat up bolani in pan with olive oil until its crispy on the outside...good stuff! Users/ericaSbutnotreally

20080730 15:49:34 nbsp The sweet jalapeno sauce is AMAZING!! Get it with the spinach bolani and garlicmintcheese! Ill be trying some more combinations today... Users/paige22ae

20100301 12:26:05 nbsp They do indeed taste amazing!  The price scares me off though.  If it were cheaper, Id get it for sure... Users/IDoNotExist

20100301 13:04:05 nbsp Spinach bolani with lentils and the spicysweet sauce (forget the name).  Yum. Users/CovertProfessor

20100320 13:18:56 nbsp the first time i ran across the bolani stall at davis farmers market, the guy whipped together a sample and as he handed it to me said its so good itll make you wanna slap your mama! i was momentarily offended, but after tasting had to agree. my girlfriend agreed as well. Users/boing3887

20100723 12:43:11 nbsp man, these things are outrageously delicious. How these flat pieces of bread can be so tasty yet so healthy is a marvel. Unfortunately, the wallet gets a bit light after a purchase /

The spreads are also equally good and do indeed compliment bolani well  not to mention being hearty, delicious spreads for other foods as well!

You should definitely buy some to support these guys. Who knows, maybe they will one day be cheaper? (I sure hope so)... Users/blastoff

20100723 13:31:26 nbsp Man, I love Bolani.  So amazing.  Last time I went to the farmers market in Livermore, there was a different guy selling it there.  I told him how much I love the free samples that the guys here in Davis give out, and his reply was, oh, man, I can beat that! and, if possible churned out the delicious samples even faster.  Its pricey, but sooooo worth it.  I also recommend the larger jars of the jalapeno sauce.  I forget exactly whats in it, but IMO its the best of the sauces.  And thats  saying something. Users/TomGarberson
  I agree about the jalapeno sauce.  Any suggestions for what else to eat with it besides bolanis?  cp
   Ive used it on sammiches (I like it a lot with hummus and all the regular veggies and stuff on a turkey or ham sammich), Ive put it on pitas (with and without cream cheese), and I like it a lot with a variety of foods.  One of our favorites is an Indian dish called http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/padmalakshmi/keemaindianspicedgroundvealandbeefwithpeasrecipe/index.html Keema (using just ground beef, no veal).  That on top of fresh http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Naan/Detail.aspx naan right off the grill, topped with some yogurt and a drizzling of the jalapeno sauce... its just heaven!  Itd also go extremely well with warm bolani instead of the naan. tg
    Thanks  good suggestions!  
20120517  East & West now sells Bolani and sauces at Costco  theyre demoing them this week through Sunday the 20th.  Soooo good! babs
