Bollards provide a separation between vehicle traffic and bicycle and pedestrian traffic, and can provide humor when observed with a less than serious eye. They can be made of wood, concrete, plastic or metal and come in permanent, phallic symbol and break away versions. Emergency vehicles know which are the break away ones and when needed they will drive through them. They can pose a hazard to bicyclists who lack situational awareness.

Here are photos of a few varieties around the The Greenbelt greenbelt and UC Davis campus:


 In Town 
In town there are many different types of bollards.  Wooden ones often separate the end of a culdesacs culdesac from the greenbelt.  Plastic or metal ones may be locked to the ground with a padlock.


Approaching UC Davis campus are the 3rd & University Poles which essentially serve to redirect car traffic, although cars are allowed on both sides.

 On Campus 
UC Davis Campus has a profusion of bollards separating the many bike paths from rare vehicular traffic.  Rather than always segregating cars and bikes, some of them seem to serve only to slow bikes when approaching a pedestrianonly corridor.  Some of campus wooden bollards have a color code indicating their level of permanence.  The red tipped ones are built in, while the yellow tipped ones are both removable and breakable.  Close to the base there is a thin cut all the way around them.  I wouldnt try it on your bike though, not even your Fixed Gear Bicycles fixie.

 In Winters 

While the bollards in nearby Winters arent strictly in Davis, they are notable for being a quick drive or ride away.  Why would you want to go look at another towns bollards?  Because when they went up in late 2008, they managed to make regional news for their phallic shape, with television news stories enthusiastically interviewing people who would say it looks like a penis, and the media using phrases like, the city managers on the phone and he wants to know about the penises.

Charles R. Wallaces column on December 25 also talked about the bollards. The Davis Enterprise also printed Debras December 25 column from the Express on http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_verz39.882004&rft_idinfo:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:DVEB&rft_val_formatinfo:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat12541392A88E1C50&svc_datInfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat0FCEDEB95BD4D563 December 21, 2008.




20091206 13:27:30 nbsp Great page idea... well have to get lots of pics to show the great variety of bollards around campus and elsewhere, the same way weve got so many of the bike racks documented.  And while were on the subject of bollards, is it just me, or are some of the bollards more treacherous than others?  Some of them seem too close together for comfort.  Users/CovertProfessor
 I think that all bollards on campus are spaced wide enough to let a http://www.gemcar.com/ GEM through. Users/WilliamLewis
  But not all the bollards around town are, that I know.   Users/CovertProfessor
