The BombBomb Roll was conceived by UCD student and culinary extraordinaire Jonathan Borrayo and is quite possibly one of the best things made at Davis Sushi Buffet. The roll is made special by order and boasts a delicious line up of fillings including: soft shell crab, avocado, and salmon and is also topped off with unagi and three types of sauce. It is rumored that upon its conception the clouds parted and the Heavens themselves brought forth this exquisite example of sushi delight. If you like a little heat try the spicy BombBomb Roll ;)
