Bombadil Lane is one of the many Navigating Davis streets in Davis Village Homes neighborhood that are named after places or characters in J.R.R. Tolkiens books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

Bombadil Lane branches off from Oakenshield Road, and Goldberry Lane branches off from Bombadil Lane.

Tom Bombadil is an ancient and jovial spirit who lives in the Old Forest. He is described as being Old as the world, and sings constantly. Tom helped the four hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry) to escape the clutches of an evil willow tree, and later helped them again when they were caught by an undead creature called a barrow wight.
