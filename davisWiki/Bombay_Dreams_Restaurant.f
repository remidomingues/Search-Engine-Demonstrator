Bombay Dreams Restaurant was a restaurant that served Indian and Himalayan food.  They had a variety of items from Himanchal to Bollywood and from South Indian back to queens necklace.  From their website it appeared they had a lunch buffet with 25+ items.  They had a coupon on the website for $1 off the lunch buffet, as well as one for either 15% off your total dine in or take out bill, or buy 1 dinner get 1 half off.  There did not appear to be an expiration date on the coupons (probably an oversight?).  You could save the image to your computer to get a decent sized version for printing.

Sunday 24 July 2011. Buffet was only offered Monday through Friday.

This location was previously occupied by Tacos and Beer and before it was Tacos and Beer it was a longtime Togos sandwich shop. Preethi Indian Cuisine is now at this location.

20110612 21:11:56 nbsp Just got back from eating here.  We went to what was like a soft opening.  The food was delicious, best naan in Davis, really flavorful veggie pakoras and the sweet lassi was just the right amount of sweetness.  I feel like a lot of places have things too sweet, but this one hit the spot and it was refreshing.   We ordered Lamb Vindaloo and a chicken Dosa.  The dosa was really good, and this is the only place around here that you can get one.  The vindaloo was good as well, though their lamb dishes seemed pricier.  Overall Im definitely coming back!  Users/RohiniJasavala
  Actually, Raja has dosas, too, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday dinners.  But I look forward to trying the new restaurant.  I hope this town can support four Indian restaurants!   Users/CovertProfessor
   What Bombay Dreams has to do is have a delivery service, that is their key to good business in Davis, even if it may be expensive, I think it will be great for them.

20110618 16:05:15 nbsp This is a lovely restaurant. The food was delicious, the decor tasteful and the service excellent. I liked the selection of colors and paintings on the walls. They have created a very pleasant ambiance. Their menu has a wide selection and everything we ordered was really well done. Their tandoori dish with seafood was outstanding, flavorful pokoras, wonderful palak paneer and very tasty chicken korma. I believe their mango lassi is the best in town. The people working there were very polite, accommodating and making sure we enjoyed our food. I am definitely coming back, I have a lot more dishes I want to try out!!! Users/Virosa

20110621 10:20:19 nbsp Food here is amazing! I agree that its the best naan in Davis, not too doughy or burnt at all. The owners/waiters are friendly and even gave us a free appetizer! The food looked really fresh. We ordered the Tikka Masala and Korma. Definitely will go back here again.  Users/sophiaxtai

20110621 10:21:45 nbsp How are the prices compared to the other Indian places in town? Users/TomGarberson

  Its more expensive, like $12.75 for chicken tikka masala a la carte.   Users/MikeyCrews

20110623 18:36:53 nbsp Bombay Dreams Restaurant, a quaint yet modern establishment, is no dream. It is more like when you wake up from a pleasant dream and are astonished to find that it is in fact a wonderful reality. Nestled in the heart of downtown between F street and G street, the Bombay Dreams Restaurant serves what I, a simple patron, believe to be the finest indian food Davis has to offer. Between naan that floats off the plate like a sweet delicious cloud and an unidentified appetizer that resembles some sort of delicious indian falafel, I was practically full before the entree arrived. I would highly recommend this restaurant to both connoisseurs of fine indian food and novices alike. Users/gilfranco

20110623 19:01:01 nbsp Feel free to correct me if Im wrong but I think this place is owned by the same people as Namaste.  I saw someone who I know work(ed?) as management there working here opening day.  The food costs more (have yet to eat) but the environment is more upscale than the booths and buffet of Namaste so that probably makes sense.  Users/OliviaY
  Perhaps downtown rents are higher than those in the U Mall?  cp

20110624 14:42:16 nbsp I am lucky enough to work in the same building as Bombay Dreams.  The food is amazing, wellpriced, and the staff is very friendly.  Try the Vegetable Korma, the mango chutney chicken (I forgot the name), the Spinach Saag, and the Chicken Tikka Masalla.  Also, the buffet is only $9 per person and it is available for lunch 7 days a week. Users/JustinLowenthal

20110624 16:34:30 nbsp We ate at Bombay this week and the food (chicken tandoori, naan, and saag chana masala) was delicious.  There were a couple of issuesorder was screwed up a bit and there are some tables that are bitter cold under the a/c, but the staff was very accommodating.  We wish them the best and will be returning often! Users/ScottLay

20110625 14:15:59 nbsp I have eaten at Bombay dreams now twice and I have to report that it is delicious. Very different from Namaste and Kathmandu. I highly recommend their stuffed naan and the samosa chat to start. For mains, the shrimp stir fry and the Jai Chicken Chili are amazing. The portions are quite substantial and the service has been great. I really founds this place to have the most flavorful dishes in town. They also deliver! I have not gone to their lunchtime buffet yet but II will definitely try it. Users/daniellekemmer

20110625 17:13:42 nbsp They have really good food and good service. The mango chicken is amazing. Im glad we have another good option for Indian food in Davis now. Users/twblalock

20110712 16:36:56 nbsp Realy great. The Naan is so good and so different.  I agree with other posts that it is unique from the other indian restaurants. Kind of hard to beat the service at Rajas, but it was good.  Better than Namaste and Katmandu. Users/LokiAbbi

20110716 08:48:55 nbsp Friday night 71511) went for the first time. Food & service were excellent. Staff was attentive. Decorated nicely. Prices were fair for the amount of food you get. Would definitely return. Also got a free appetizer. What I liked best was there was NO TV blaring. Just a pleasant atmosphere. Well go back for sure. Users/dianamuprhy

20110719 22:08:57 nbsp I went there for dinner and got a vegan dish, which can be hard to find at some places (especially if you dont like fried food).  And it was fantastic! My mom was with me, and she is very picky, and loved the chicken korma. Definitely go here! Users/Sorrel

20110722 19:07:43 nbsp The lunch buffet was not offered last saturday 07/16 lunchtime, opening hiccups maybe. I noticed an Indian chef  in the kitchen and another Pakistani chef came out and chatted with me and asked about the food. He had made a lamb dish from the menu (the name I forgot, sorry), which was perfect and authentic, with just the right spice balance. My partner ordered the orange curry combo, which was well made and tasty as well.  Look forward to going there often :) Users/snehalt

20110726 23:49:36 nbsp The Indian food here is pretty good. Probably my favorite Indian place so far(not after the last visit). Kathman was previously my favorite but now this place is better(Kathman is still my favorite with the exception that i like Bombaays naan better when its warm). This place actually sold Kathman to the current owners a few years back i heard from people working there and now decided to start up their own. This place is the BEST naan in Davis, imo, hands down. The entrees Ive tried were all very good. Hoping to go back and try out some more of their other items.  

Update: although their food is still good, somethings didnt seems as good as the first time. I went again and this time around, the naan, although still delicious, was not as warm/fresh as the first time around. The rice was pretty bad. The rice tasted like minute rice and was dry. Hopefully next visit will be better

20110808 10:28:10 nbsp The first time I went, about a month after they opened, the naan was great, and I tried the butter chicken and coconut lamb.  Both dishes were awesome, and I thought I found a new #1 Indian restaurant in Davis.  Service was very good as well.  I should note that there was also only about 4 other customers in the restaurant at the time.

I went again about a week ago, and I ordered the same dishes and naan types... The naan wasnt as fluffy, and the keema naan was noticeably less stuffed than the first time.  Also, the butter chicken was completely different.  It was so different that at first I thought they brought us the wrong dish.  The coconut lamb was also different from the first time I went, more similar to the other restaurants in town.  Both changes were downgrades from the first time I went... Im not sure if they have different chefs on different nights, or if they just switched chefs or recipes all together.   Users/BrianMatthews

20110808 13:38:50 nbsp soooooo good! My husband and I went last night. The service was GREAT and the food was delicious. Im from the San Francisco area and have been a little disappointed with the Indian food in Davis when we moved here, but this restaurant makes up for all that. My husband and I ordered the chicken curry and basil naan. The curry had the perfect blend of spcies. Oh my gosh go here and enjoy! Users/jenb

20110822 10:04:24 nbsp Meh food, poor service and considering those two things, very high prices.  The cost is above average for Indian places in town but only by maybe a dollar or two on most dishes. Went here for lunch on a Saturday and the place was empty.  Only one other table.  Our food, and we only ordered two appetizer plates, took a good 2030 minutes to arrive.  Meanwhile the family of four seated nearby, who had already ordered before we walked in, had to get up to ask the waiter how much longer it was going to be.  We ordered the appetizer samplers to get a feel for the food and none of it was particularly memorable.  The Naan was good, but not special in comparison to Namaste.  Probably wont be back here again unless I want to sit at the bar to watch Bollywood films.  Too bad, the decor is really beautiful. Users/OliviaY

20110823 12:00:18 nbsp I know everyones entitled to their own opinion but I disagree with OliviaYs comment. This may not be a big deal to some but my fathers family (8 kids) grew up in India, so Ive had more than my fair share of Indian. Im used to good indian food so every time an Indian restaurant opens in town, or even in Sacramento, my husband and I are very quick to try it. Were seeking GOOD indian food here people. When Namaste opened, I tried it, but was not impressed. Bombay Dreams however IS a total dream. You have to wait for good food and I dont believe that 2030 minutes is long for good food, unless youre at In N Out... The Naan is the best naan Ive had in Davis. Try the basil garlic naan, its my fave! Im definitely going back there, many times, it literally is the BEST Indian Food in Davis. And just for the record, the buffet is the same price as Namaste but the food is more delicious.  Users/jenb

20110901 09:01:50 nbsp Amazing!!! This might be my new favorite restaurant in Davis. Its not just the best Indian food in town, this restaurant really has a special sense of flavor and presenting a superb meal. I dont agree that it is expensive or that there was a long wait. Really excellent cooking, atmosphere and allaround experience. Users/Lasan

20110921 12:16:19 nbsp I have to agree with all previous positive comments.  Have been here twice, once the week it opened and once last night.  Food was wonderful both times.  This most recent visit, all dishes (vegetarian appetizer sample platter, prawn tikka masala, muttar paneer) had complex spice profiles, were cooked perfectly, and arrived promptly.  The prawn dish came with 6 huge shrimp without tails on!  The muttar paneer was packed full of delicious green peas  no skimping on veggies.  And I was particularly impressed by the appetizer sampler, which included veggie fritters, mini pakoras, veggie momos, and naan.  The fried items were really light, way less greasy than at other Indian joints in town, and the momos were fresh and tender, not doughy or chewy, with flavorful filling.  Waitstaff was attentive  our water glasses were never empty  and they accepted their website coupon when I showed it on my phone.  We didnt order meat, but for seafood and veggie dishes, I believe their prices are comparable to others in town, plus they have the allimportant buyonegetonehalfoff discount.  I see no reason not to make this my new regular Indian restaurant, as I now prefer it above the other local choices.  Sorry, Kathmandu. Users/LauraLibby

20110923 14:26:13 nbsp This is exactly what Davis needed: a really good Indian restaurant! I have been here a couple times now for lunch and the staff has been very nice and the food has been very, very good. I cant recommend this restaurant enough! Users/ToNils

20111024 21:38:32 nbsp More like Bombay Nightmares!! I came here to celebrate a birthday with a group of six. It was one of the worst dining experiences I have endured during the three years I have resided in Davis. Aside from the fact that we had to seat ourselves, and the fact that people who arrived after us were seen to and served before us, the birthday boy was not served what he had ordered after all that wait. The staff was not courteous about  their mistake; rather, they accused us for asking for chicken when we specifically said lamb, and were almost charged for the lamb on the bill. Though they did finally apologize, they had the audacity to offer the lamb for half price in addition to the chicken dish. PLEASE!! On top of that, the chicken meat was dry and tasteless; I wouldnt even feed it to my dog. In addition, the dish they served our food in had not ever been washed. When I informed our waitress that I was aware that she had served my food in an unclean dish, she had the nerve to respond with insulting my intelligence by denying this. It was blantently obvious that this dish was brand new and had not been washed as the price sticker was perfectly adhered to it; and the ink on the sticker was not in the least bit faded. This just says so much for how sanitary their culinary practices are.  They compensated us with a scant portion of dessert. We were served a small bowl of rice pudding with six spoons. To split this bowl of rice pudding, we had to resort to one of two options: (1) eat out of the same bowl like pigs eating out of a trough, or (2) pour it into our used waterglasses. After all this, not only were we not given any complementry birthday treats, we were charged for the dish we neither asked for nor ate. Users/Artime

20111029 20:43:25 nbsp Tikka Masala was amazing. But Service was bad. Slow, unfriendly, and we had to ask for refills.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20111109 21:25:17 nbsp My girlfriend and I ate here tonight and were very pleasantly surprised. We have eaten at almost every restaurant in Davis after moving here over a year ago, and we can safely say there are very few consistently quality establishments in Davis. We tend to avoid Indian/Himalayan places because the last time we ate at Namaste, we both got sick and threw up as soon as we got home, and the food was terrible. After some hesitation we decided to try Bombay Dreams Out. It is hands down the best Indian/Himalayan in Davis. Prices are very reasonable considering how much food you get. Service was good and a very nice atmosphere. We ordered a veggie somas/pakoras/momos/nan appetizer plate that was HUGE for $6.95. The gentlement sitting next to us even commented on it and couldnt believe it was that cheap. We also ordered coconut chicken and chicken curry, but spicy. Everything was fantastic. Tasted extremely fresh. The nan was fluffy and hot, as good as everyone has claimed. Spicy definitely has a kick to it but was not overwhelming. We also ordered a mango lassi and it was excellent as well. We highly recommend Bombay Dreams. They gave us a coupon before we left for a buy one get one free entre as well. 5 out of 5 stars for sure. Users/angrychair

20111116 20:41:44 nbsp Ate here a couple weeks after their opening and was pleasantly surprised. Got the butter chicken thali and every dish in it was AMAZING. My friend also enjoyed her food. We both had plenty of delicious leftovers. Went here again with family and friends last week and it didnt disappoint. Even though they were EXTREMELY busy, we still got our food in a timely manner and the servers remembered to check on us occasionally. I got the butter chicken thali again because it was too good last time. It was just as good although the lentil soup was cold and Im not sure if it was supposed to be. Also got a mango lassi and its definitely the best mango lassi in town. Contrary to other reviews, I think their naan bread is their worst feature. I LOVE naan and make it home as well; Ive made it from scratch and also from mixes. Bombay Dreams naan is rather bland and sticks in your mouth. It doesnt have that special naan flavor. But, the rest of their food is definitely the best Indian in town and I hope the restaurant is successful! Users/gurglemeow

20111118 20:00:30 nbsp I ate there tonight in a group of 5 adults and 2 kids. The staff was very accommodating and nice to the kids. We sat on the side near the bar, which I enjoyed because I love Bollywood music videos. The groups favorite dish was the okra. That might not be something most people try, but its not gooey. Its crispy and very flavorful. We even had tasty dessert: gulab jamun and kheer. For us, it was a good family restaurant. Users/NoelBruening

20111210 22:05:50 nbsp I have just returned home after dining at this restaurant with my friends. I have to say that food here is quite exquisite. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and truly complements the dining experience. Initially, I was disappointed about the portion sizes of the a la carte in comparison to the Thali portion size. I was frank with my friends and criticized the pricing in relation to the portion size. However, after taking one bite of the Lamb Tikka Mansala (which I highly recommend with medium spiciness) I was taken aback and I immediately begin to truly enjoy Indian food for the first time in Davis. The lamb was impeccably prepared in my opinion: flavorful, tender, moist, and cooked perfectly throughout. I have eaten at the other Indian establishments in Davis and, I can say without a doubt, the quality of the cuisine here outclasses those locations. I was left moderately full and with a tremendously satisfying dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant. However, price is an issue and your personal choice to patron here will depend how much you weigh price over quality. Yet, I still recommend to at least trying it once. I truly hope you have the same great experience I have had here. Users/JonathanLuong

20111217 12:08:10 nbsp I went here for dinner on my birthday a month ago. My group was supposed to eat at Tres Hermanas, but I failed to make a reservation and were forced to eat elsewhere. So, we wandered downtown Davis on a cold, Friday night for a restaurant that wasnt jampacked, and we ended up at Bombay Dreams, who were willing to accommodate my large, 10+ person group after only a 5 minute wait . Im happy I didnt make that reservation at Tres, because Bombay Dreams had the best dosa Ive ever had! And after dinner, they gave us this birthday cake out of gulab jamun and whipped cream. haha. It was an excellent experience. Definitely coming back...for those dosas.

Does anyone know if we can order off the menu during lunch? Or is a buffet the only option? Users/TheShah

20120201 11:05:46 nbsp I really like this place, the atmosphere is very nice, the food is very good, service is fine.  They also have very reasonable beer prices on Aggie Lager which pairs well with Indian food. Users/DagonJones

20120203 15:26:55 nbsp Excellent! Food was fresh, tasty, and a couple steps above Kathmandu and Namaste. Beer and wine prices very reasonable. Service much better than Kathmandus (though, ironically, one of Kathmandus former waitresses works there now). Very good restaurant. Users/AJThompson

20120228 16:13:17 nbsp Big fan of this place!  I used to be a regular at Kathmandu Kitchen, but the food there has (unfortunately) been hit/miss from time to time.  I stumbled into this place about a month back, and keep finding myself coming back.  Just about everything here tastes great.  One of the best parts: the fresh nan brought to your table at the buffet lunch... very nice gesture, and tastes amazing. Users/ChonT

20120428 20:25:44 nbsp Did Bombay Dreams close? I went to go get dinner on Thursday, April 26th and it was closed. I drove by today (4/28) and also called at 8pm and no one answered. Does anyone know what is happening? Users/Sarge

20120428 21:18:19 nbsp I thought the food there was quite good.  Its almost exactly like Kathmandu, including the menu items and the layout of the items in the buffet.  It doesnt taste exactly the same though.  They must be using different recipes.  Id say the food at Kathmandu is slightly better, but the same stuff at Bombay Dreams doesnt leave me feeling like I ate way too much (even though I ate the same amount).

I tried calling them tonight and got a voicemail.  Im curious if they are still operating too.  Anyone know?
