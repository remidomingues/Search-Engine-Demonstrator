Got a Books book or magazine that youve read and dont plan to read again?  Want to try a new book without having to go to a Bookstores bookstore?  Want to reduce the use of trees and energy to make books?  Public library not taking your books?  List them here.  If you have a book, please list the name of the book, and a link to your page on the wiki so that someone who wants your book can contact you.  If you want a book, you can list the books you want here too.  Generally, if you want a book listed on this page, its polite to have a book to offer in trade, in order to keep the supply of available books high.  (This isnt a requirement, but please consider offering a book if you no longer need it, or if you received it through a book trade and have since read it.)  If you see a genre not listed here, please add it.
