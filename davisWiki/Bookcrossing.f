How?

The general idea of http://www.bookcrossing.com Bookcrossing is to read and release Bookstores books into the Spots And Places wild for others to find, who then do likewise.  Books are registered on the website, http://www.bookcrossing.com, and given a Book Crossing ID number, or BCID, which is then written or affixed onto the Bookstores books.  Those who find the books are then encouraged to log them onto the website, so the person who released can track it and know that it has been found!  Logging in a book only takes a few seconds and can be Wiki Anonymity anonymous, no member registration or anything is required.  Common release areas include Benches park benches, Restaurants restaurants, and Cafes coffee shops.

Logging in books is absolutely FREE, with no obligation or or personal information required.  Member registration is free of charge or obligation to continue.

There is an official Crossing Zone at Common Grounds, making it a good place to drop/acquire new reads.

Its no surprise that Hoopies hoopie towns like Davis have several members, while some places (entire countries on occasion) have a lone bookcrosser.

Why? To make the world a Library library, encourage people who normally wouldnt to read, and to pass on good works of literature to others.

Please, if you find a book, do a favor and log it in or put it somewhere cool where it will be found by someone who might read it.
