Borders Books, Music, Cafe was the largest bookstores bookstore in the city, located downtown in the Davis Commons. The store opened in 1997. They had a Seattles Best Coffee Seattles Best coffee shop with ample studying space, although using it for studying was Study Spots not recommended by many due to the crowded nature and the occasionally enforced time limit on tables. Borders signed a licensing agreement with Seattles Best Coffee in August of 2004 to add Seattles Best Coffee Cafes to their stores. The cafes were managed and operated by Borders employees.

Of particular note was their large manga section. Their role playing section was woefully out of date, unsorted and appeared to be a fairly random selection. Some books appeared in Science Fiction/Fantasy despite being pure rulebooks. Also of particular interest was their diminutive philosophy section, which was slowly being eclipsed by the religious and selfhelp sections.  The pornography porn and erotica section was skimpy, with little beyond Playboy, Playgirl, and Penthouse. It had a great selection of art review magazines, but not nearly as many as Newsbeat.

Borders began offering free WiFi from Verizon in October 2009.  However, the WiFi connections at Borders was fraught with problems.  You might have experienced the need to reauthenticate several times per minute.  Connections were sometimes reasonably fast, but often horribly slow  possibly because of people using too much of the connection bandwidth from their laptops.  It was not a recommended service.

Borders shuffled its inventory frequently, throwing out books (sans front covers) at the rate of about 1/2 cubic meter / week, and magazines at about double that rate. This made the Dumpster Diving dumpsters behind the store particularly fruitful. The employees were tolerant, although they would prefer that you not pick through the garbage during business hours and asked that you return the books to the dumpster when you were done browsing through them. Keep in mind that authors and publishers are not paid for books that are thrown out. Most authors (and even most publishers) want them read regardless of how you get them, but if you have the money, supporting the arts means buying a book.

You could have come and enjoy or participated in the Open Mic open mic every first Friday of the month.

 The closing of Borders 

The last day of the Borders liquidation was September 16th, 2011. Now the store is closed for good.

Some closing events:
  Judge approves Borders liquidation bid: http://www.suntimes.com/business/6517488420/judgeapprovesbordersliquidationbid.html link
  Borders Books announced on Monday, July 18, 2011 that they will be liquidating and closing all stores. There were no bidders for the company, other than liquidators, after a deal with a private equity investor was rejected by creditors.  The Borders chain will close for good. This http://davis.patch.com/articles/borderssalesstarttodayletterfromceo letter from the CEO discusses the companys demise.
  The cafe closed, and closed forever, before the rest of the store.  Most of the computers throughout the store were permanently shut down as well. As for the rest, its just a matter of time. On July 21, an employee stated that she had no idea when the store would close down, but she made a guess of September.
  Another employee said that the liquidators would be arriving the next day on the 22nd. He said that the 21st is officially the last day that Borders will exist as Borders. It has been verified that liquidation sales will begin on the 22nd with up to 40% off on the entire stores inventory and fixtures. Borders gift cards will still be accepted throughout the sale.
  Just after the liquidation began, closing time at the store was posted as 9:30PM. It used to be 10PM Monday through Saturday before the liquidation.
  Heres a bit http://patch.com/Aktrv more information as it pertains to the Davis location.
  Borders filed for bankruptcy on February 16th, 2011 http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/borderspreparestofileforbankruptcy/ link.  Borders has been hit hard by low priced book sales and ebooks from Amazon, and unlike Barnes and Noble, Borders has failed to develop a viable ereader strategy.  Borders has also been unable to pay publishers, resulting in an inability to obtain new inventory.

The former Borders location was temporarily occupied by Spirit Halloween after Borders closed until just after Halloween.  It is now occupied by Whole Foods Market.

 Local controversy 

Because it is owned by wiki:wikipedia:Borders_Group Borders Group, Inc., some look down upon it for http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/330064/independent_bookstores_vs_barnes_and.html taking money away from the Davis economy and encroaching upon the several independent booksellers in town; some even voiced their concerns about this as a threat to the local bookstores to the City Council. Although profits from the business go back to the company, sales tax revenues benefit Davis and Yolo County. Since Borders opened, the The Avid Reader for Younger Readers, a branch of The Avid Reader, closed and the inventory merged back into the main stores loft.

Owners of the existing independent bookstores reported significant drop in business when Borders opened in 1997, which they have not regained. Gayles Books went out of business soon after the arrival of Borders. Bogeys Books closed January 2008. The Next Chapter chose to close and move to Woodland before Borders opened, but subsequently closed there in 2008.

Borders stores were popular in the beginning due to the selection in their superstores. Independent book stores could not compete with the sheer number of books that Borders had on their shelves. Borders provided a huge store with comfortable chairs and a cozy environment to browse and hang out. Libraries on the other hand had books that you could browse, but the decor is often described as cold and institutional, with the exception of the Davis Public Library which is actually quite awesome and arguably nicer than Borders in terms of comfort and atmosphere, if you care to check it out. There are no cafes in libraries and talking and socializing is discouraged, with exceptions such as the Davis Public Library which has indoor vending machines (if memory serves correctly) and places to socialize quietly. Borders was a place where people would go to socialize also and meet or have a coffee, but it was, by and large, a commercial experience. The chain bookstores actually influenced libraries to adapt with the times over the years. Libraries added carpeting, plush chairs, sofas, and nicer decor similar to Borders and Barnes and Noble to attract more people to the library.

Libraries often do not carry the latest books (citation needed lol). However, you could always browse the latest books and magazines at Borders. By and large, the Davis Public is purposely avoided by the upper middle class, some of which are germophobes and suffer from the delusion that public libraries are all full of frenzied hobos who grind their unhygienic private parts against the reading materials.

Actually, over 10 years ago there was a man who used to repeatedly indecently expose himself in one of the libraries on campus.

 Barnes & Noble Purchases the Trademarks of Borders 

Barnes and Noble bought most of the trademarks of Borders such as the Borders name as well as the Waldenbooks and Brentanos names. Barnes and Noble also purchased the customer list of Borders. If you had a Borders Rewards Plus Membership, Barnes & Noble contacted you by email to notify you of a free Barnes & Noble Membership valid until 1/31/2012. You received free express shipping on online orders $25 and up, 40% off hardcover bestsellers, and 10% of almost everything else in the store.

If you wanted to opt out and not have your information transferred to Barnes & Noble you could have visited http://www.barnesandnoble.com/borders and opted out by October 29, 2011.



20051206 17:09:41 nbsp Borders also has a few angry homeless people, who will yell at you to shut up if youre standing nearby and talking. They hang out there at around 2 in the morning.  Users/IsaacHamlenGomez

20060804 13:56:51 nbsp Giant (and continually expanding) manga section? Its a rather small and narrow selection, of popular titles, i.e. typical shojo fluff and generic shonen action titles. (Not that theres anything wrong with that, shojo fluff and shonen action can be good.) It isnt continually expanding either. It seems as of late that they arent really restocking the selections. However, it must be noted that fewer and fewer people browse and purchase the books. This may be partly in response to Borders permatagging the books. People hate buying permatagged books, because its akin to buying a torn book.  Users/MatthewTom

20061221 20:29:38 nbsp regarding putting hard tacks in the manga: I work at Borders, and I actually agree with the comment about it, and have registered this disagreement (and that of customers) with the manager, so he is aware. But, there is a justification for it. Basically, those things take a walk more than almost anything in the store. Its a fairly common occurrence to be looking for a specific volume that the computer says we have but no one can find it anywhere. And with all the casual reading that goes on with the manga the soft tacks simply fall out. So the only real solution to curb the theft of these things is to permatag. That said however, we are more than happy to special order a mint copy of a volume for you. I agree it sucks, but itâ€™s just the reality of it. Users/AaGg

20070608 14:24:18 nbsp Being a former employee of Borders, Im happy to respond to any comments or answer any questions that anyone might have.  Be it negative or positive comments and/or questions, Im here to help.  Dont worry though.  Im not blind to the faults that the company may or may not have.  But unnecessary slander need not apply (unless you really want to, cause really, this is the internet).

I would respond to every comment that has preceded my own but being finals week, I dont intend to expend this much time...however, if you take their word for it as law, then you really should reconsider how the internet sways you so easily (thats not to say any one of these comments is wrong or right in any manner). Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20070608 15:05:59 nbsp Hey Sunjeet, I have a question. Those magnetic strips you guys stick into books, Ive torn the inside of manyabook (mostly mangas) trying to remove them. Can you guys figure out where to put them so they dont tear when pulled off (back to manga, putting them on the inside cover almost guarantees a torn cover)? When I used to work at Crown Books way back in the day, we had similar strips. Only difference was that they didnt stick to anything, we just pressed them into the book and they wouldnt fall out.  Users/JesseSingh

20070608 20:35:23 nbsp Well Jesse, the reason they use the hard tacks is just that: so they can not be removed easily.  Its a sad reality, but the manga section is stolen from at an alarming rate.  The manga reading population may be all well and good, but with a large number of people interested, there is a significant number willing to steal.  We are forced to use the hard tacks to deter this behavior.  The best way to get around this issue is to use the Special Order system (despite the common misconception: there is no extra charge for ordering) and get a fresh, clean, never been read copy.  Although you will not be able to read it in store, it allows collectors to purchase a tackless copy.  The main downside is that you will have to wait a few more days for it to arrive, but in the end everyone goes home happy. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20070608 20:40:02 nbsp And on a side note: Borders is a retail store that primarily sells books (not to be confused with a bookstore).  Despite the habit most people seem to have, they are not a library.  Although they generally tolerate people reading for short times, they dont usually tolerate them reading in the aisles.  The manga section was notorious for this when theyd have a dozen+ people huddled in the section (a year ago, it was impossible to walk through that area).  Its gotten better since theyve started making an issue of it, but now readers are going to all corners of the store to read.  They are fine with this and understand.  However, the problem that now occurs is readers shoving the books into the shelves when they are done, no matter where in the store they are (though this is true of any place that sells books).  Please, if you are done with an item (manga or otherwise), please give it to a bookseller, cashier, or just leave it at the info desk.  Heck, leave it on the floor if youd like...its much better than depriving others from reading it as well. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080212 05:58:13 nbsp I go to Borders about twice a month to pick up a few British car/motorcycle magazines, and I usually buy a book or four that catch my eye, so I end up spending between $50$150 a visit.  After I gather my purchases, my girlfriend and I generally grab things to read and hang out for an hour or two, and its usually manga for me.  Ive never had a problem before; the staff have pretty much always been helpful and more than friendly.  Last night, though, one of the managers on duty decided to humiliate us by singling me out publicly in the cafe area, starting off with You KNOW we dont allow you to read MANGA in the store (imagine the sneer yourself, since I didnt take a picture) and continuing to Ill take all of those now, as if I was a tenyear old who got caught stealing.  She gave me a corporateline apology after I tried to get a different manager to talk to at the register, so I guess Ill forget my thoughts of flaming righteous boycott, but thinking about it now still makes me want to scream and punch someone.

20080212 05:59 nbsp To increase your chances of getting hired on at Borders, avoid being too honest on the personality profiling section of the application. If you let on that you have leadership potential, your application wont pass the first round. Longtime managers are acutely aware that anyone with genuine leadership ability (or a modicum of assertiveness, antiauthoritarianism, imagination, etc.) wont tolerate the work conditions for long: shelving monotony, oft dreary custodial duties, customer relations tediousness, and rote memory/regurgitation of corporate culture slogans (Would you like to receive our online newsletter? . . . ) are par for the course.

It may be a corporation with job defined duties like custodial and rote memorizing but what job doesnt have that?  I feel sorry for the employees having to clean up the public restrooms at this store.  If I have to walk into the ladies room and see blood or feces sprayed on the wall one more time...

20080626 00:33:31 nbsp As a BookLOVER, I find it amazing that folks that visit Borders and Barnes and Noble use them as a library.  Its almost like vistors feel entitled to sit for hours and read, stack books all over the place leaving a hugeass mess and then complain that staff trys to run it as a business or a retail store.  Its no wonder that you perceive the staff as unfriendly or bitchy.  I like a bookstore to be organized, alphabetized and free of parasites sitting in the aisles blocking the areas where I want to BUY books.  Its a retail store, not a study hall.  If I buy one more book/magazine at Borders with crumbs or coffee stains on the back... Users/booklover

  Amen!  The thing I find funny is how at bigger stores like the ones you mentioned, people never ask if its ok to read in the store; they just assume.  However, if you go to smaller, independent bookstores, people usually ask if its ok before doing so.  I wonder if people do so because they dont care about the big box stores or if they know its not ok, but just have more respect for the smaller indy stores? Users/SunjeetBaadkar


  Its almost like visitors feel entitled to sit for hours and read.  Yeah we do. Some of us just know how to treat books. booklover seems to be a Borders employee, and as such, her/is comments come off as that much more offensive. I have NEVER been into a bookstore that wont allow you to browse the books on the shelves. I guess if a particular corporation is focused on selling as many books as possible, without regard for the quality of the books,   they would want people to get in, buy lots of books without reading them first, and get out before theres any loss of efficiency in this capitalist transaction. If ANY bookstore employee interrupted my reading to tell me this isnt a library, even if they called themselves a booklover, Id tell them where to go and never buy from there again. Users/PxlAted

    Im in the middle on this (and dont let my current employment distract my point) and agree that people should be allowed to browse as needed (in fact, at my store, we encourage people to sit in the store as long as they want and just read; we get a lot of regulars that do just that as well as study or play chess or whatever and have never told anyone to leave just for anything).  I do, however, agree with the first point made about visitors leaving stacks of books all over the place, but then again, Im not the type to be grabbing more books than I can hold with a single hand unless I intend on buying them all.  Or worse, people shoving the books back into the wrong place just because they are in a hurry to go somewhere else and dont want to admit to the bookstore employees that they dont remember where the book they pulled goes.  That is my biggest pet peeve because it deprives others of being able to enjoy the book just for the sake of a previous patrons not wanting to admit having a bad memory or being too lazy.  But this is just me ranting... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080721 23:32:39 nbsp Sorry, not an employee.  But I am a book collector/lover who loves Borders.

20080902 03:48:18 nbsp This comment of Borders and B&N not being libraries (which theyre not) brings up a good point, though: where is there a library to read comic books at? :D

On a more relevant noteIve just moved to Davis and havent been to Borders yet. How big is it relative to, say, the one in northern Sacramento? When Ive driven by it going to and from the campus while I lived in Sac, it seemed somewhat small. Users/RobertM525
   Depends on the system.  I know some library systems do carry comic books (right next to the magazines).  Do any of the many local library libraries?
     The Davis Public Library actually has quite an impressive collection of comics and manga (theyre in the young adult section), and an even larger collection is available through the interlibrary loan system. Also, if theres a title you want that they dont have, you can request they purchase it. In my experience, they are relatively quick to purchase new items. The popular series tend to always be checked out, I found it easiest to use the online system to reserve them.

20080920 17:40:07 nbsp Its funny how the police are always there on time to hand out tickets. The only time I really needed the cops was when this angry teen tried to attack me and my mom at the sale section set up outside Borders. Luckily, two guys confronted this angry heckler who kept calling me the N word (which didnt make sense, cuz I was asian). Eventually, one of the bystanders called the cops.

  It is both.  Although it is sort of two seperate company names, the SBC staff is crosstrained and also is able to work as the floor staff (who also takes care of things).  However, when it comes to cleaning, there is an actual cleaning crew that is not affiliated with the Borders staff that comes in every night to clean.  Roaches in the chairs is most likely the result of clumsy customers dropping crumbs and other food substances on the chair in the process of consuming whatever product they just bought from SBC.  Most customers dont like to fess up to their mistakes and move on quite quickly without a second thought.  The cleaning crew does not regularly clean the chairs as they mostly specialize in carpets and windows (and the bathrooms).  The SBC staff deals with the cafe area (which consists of the serving area and kitchen, not the customer area).  If sometimes like this occurs, it would be prudent to let a manager know as they will be the ones who will actually take action and have the cleaning crew take care of it.

20100830 12:28:19 nbsp Borders has become a bit of a community gathering spot over the years, and yes, some people treat it like their own private livingroom, but in these times when Borders has struggled to keep from going under it seems they should should maintain a high level of customer service.
On Sunday 8/29/10 my wife and I went to Jamba Juice and then into Borders, as we have for years. Within 3min. I was approached by a clerk who told me that I couldnt bring in outside food or beverages into the store. What? Is that really smart in these times? I told her that seemed rather counterproductive to be excluding customers from their store. The clerk said that people drinking Jamba Juice had spilled and ruined their carpets. I was rather surprised to say the least. One of my favorite Davis pasttimes gone!

Im not questioning their right to do this, but it just seems ro be supremely stupid move on their part. If they were really worried about people spilling, they better close their coffee shop with all their gooey treats.

At first I thought this was a ridiculous rule so I mentioned that if they offer free WiFi isnt it expected that they have outlets to charge the computers that will be using that WiFi? She then told me I was going to need to leave the store.  I grab a drink from borders before I go to work almost everyday, and I will now be going elsewhere for that and any books.  So disappointing.

A couple days ago somebody (whether on accident or not) spilled (actually the cup looked like it had exploded in some way) Jamba Juice in the Politics & History section, causing several books to be damaged as well as the floor to be stained. People constantly leave Habit Burger cups with cold drinks in them, which leave water on the shelves for books to be damaged further. To me, this is a perfectly understandable policy. Users/ZeroZero

20110409 08:58:06 nbsp Its official; Id like to see this Borders go out of business.  My girlfriend and I, being perpetually broke college grads in this tough economy, like to go out and do free/cheap stuff in town as much as possible.  One of our goto outings is to head to a bookstore for some recreational reading, but the Borders employees love to give us a hard time.  Weve been scolded for sitting on the floor instead of the stools, blocking access to the books, taking off our sandals, and yes, recently, for bringing in outside food.  We always clean up after ourselves, were quiet, we find corners of the store where customers are unlikely to go, and we never bother anyone, which is more than I can say for half their customers, particularly high schoolers.  They do everything in their power to make our visits to their store as unpleasant as possible, compounded by the fact that their bathrooms are always disgusting.

Listen, I know its a bookstore and not a library.  But a store should never make you feel unwelcome when youre minding your own business.  Dont they have bigger things to worry about?  If I find a book that I legitimately like, Im GOING to buy it.  Maybe Id do so more often if their prices werent ridiculously high.

Im sticking to Avid Reader from now on. Users/AdamV

20110415 13:52:10 nbsp @AdamV

1. Ive never seen a book at the Avid Reader for less than the recommended retail price.
2. You just admitted that you do, indeed, block access to books. It is a STORE with the intention of selling books to customers. Thus, blocking the books is somewhat rude.
3. Taking off your shoes is a hygiene issue, so your complaints about the bathrooms is thus void since it doesnt seem that you care about hygiene anyway. Considering people have actually shat on the carpet there at Borders before.
4. Finding a seat at Borders is ridiculously easy and the staff have never bothered me when sitting properly on a stool or in the cafe.

And 5. Youd really like the equally poor college grads AND students who work at Borders to lose their jobs because you cant be bothered to follow rules that all or most retail stores enforce? Users/ZeroZero

20110705 18:10:35 nbsp @Zero Zero

I dont recall saying that the employees dont have the right to enforce their policies.  Im pretty sure I said that I wish they werent so rude about it.  Expensive though their books may be, the employees at Avid Reader have never made me feel as unwelcome as those at Borders.  They make me feel like a guest and not a parasite.  Is it too much to ask that Borders follow suit?  I didnt say that I WAS blocking books.  I said that they SCOLDED me for blocking the books.  Which I wasnt.  Why would I get angry at them if I know Im in the wrong?

I dont want to get into the details of hygiene with you here, but being shoeless in a part of the bookstore that ISNT the coffee shop isnt analogous to my hands coming in contact with the filth in the bathroom.  Its just not.  And youre dumb for thinking it is.  Also for thinking that finding seating is easy.  Also for thinking that I, someone who makes less than $10,000 a year, can be personally responsible for costing a retail employee their job.  Think before you post. Users/AdamV

20110716 08:08:36 nbsp  Sounds like a parasite to me, and you are bothering people whether you think so or not. Wanting a business whose purpose is to make money to provide you free entertainment while you violate rules? FU  get out of my store you are bad for business, in addition to not buying anything. As a customer Id be less likely to shop and spend money at a store where barefoot tards are sitting on the floor taking up space and rummaging through new items for sale, but you never thought about that did you selfish, and sounds grimy. Get out of the 60s man, its 2011. How the hell do you have a computer or internet connection, or am I, the public, paying for that too? Users/RichardL
   Barefoot, sitting on the floor, chillin lol, somehow I think of 300: Madness? This... IS... CALIFORNIA! Or maybe he was reading Lord of the Rings in there and wanted to feel more immersed in the Shire chapters? :P

20110718 19:51:23 nbsp I bought a LOT of DVDs here circa 2000 they had a great selection and most of them were at least $5 below list price, on par with Best Buys pricing (and Id rather support a company like Borders than Best Buy.) A couple years later prices started creeping back up, AND they cut their selection, so it stopped being my goto place then. Sorry Borders, but you brought this on yourselves. Users/AlanSmithee

20110718 21:51:51 nbsp It was a nice bookstore, I guess, but I remember when they were  one of the very few local  businesses that wouldnt let me put up antiwar flyers on their bulletin board several years ago. You get big businesses and you get soullessness. Users/ScottMeehleib
  Actually Ive seen plenty of antiwar stuff on their bulletin board and they have that small Davis publication full of antiwar, antigovernment etc. for distribution.  So...dunno what your problem was but it was most likely a managerial individual (and thus highly subject to change) policy, not big business at all.  OY
   All I know is my own personal experience. I asked the guy at the center information desk (older guy with glasses who worked there for years) if I could post a very plain, textonly flyer, and he explained that hed have to pass it onto management for review. He also expressed that it was extremely unlikely that it would be approved because Borders is picky about not wanting to be seen as supporting one view or another (even though I have no idea how allowing a flyer implies support). He even claimed that he personally agreed with me, but he had seen things like that shot down in the past. I went back a few days later, and it still hadnt been posted. Maybe the guy just forgot to pass it on, but in any case, I didnt feel like pressing the issue, and it was the only place in Davis where I remember having that sort of experience. Maybe the flyers you saw were placed without permission, or maybe the management later had a change of heart. I dunno. Anyway, I believe its an issue with big businesses to be excessively concerned with public image neutrality in the first place. The vast majority of places in Davis let employees make decisions about this sort of thing, and they almost all immediately say yes every time. They dont have to defer to management at all unless its a big business, in my experience. The Coop was another rare exception where I had to talk to a shift leader, but he immediately granted permission without even looking at the thing. SM

20110719 14:23:31 nbsp RIP to Borders, it was a very nice place to just chill out, especially on hot summer days. I bought a lot of books for the children i work with from there. They had a lot of great sales and I didnt feel bothered or intimidated there. I wonder what they will build in that space now. Does anyone know if they are gonna do anything with the space?

20110719 14:30:44 nbsp I was at Borders this morning and one of the staff said they dont know when the Davis store will close. Users/jsbmeb

20110722 00:24:54 nbsp I will really miss Borders. It was often the only place to take my daughter in Davis when it was either raining or too hot to be outside. However, did anyone else notice that they always had the latest rightwing autobiography just as you entered the door? I rarely spent money in Borders unless I received a 40% off coupon by email. It was a good place to browse books and then buy them online. There is something special about being able to hang out and browse in bookstores and record/CD shops. It is a pity that future generations wont have this opportunity. I was walking around Orchard Parks and the domes (both of which are slated to be demolished) and I had to admit that things never get any better (at least in this country) they only get worse. Since I was born in the mid 70s I have seen so many wonderful things disappear and they have been replaced with things that I could really do without.    Users/bradjones
  It was a good place to browse books and then buy them online. < Im surprised people did not expect them to go out of business sooner. Users/hankim
     Haha! I didnt even notice how weird that comes across until you pointed it out. Come to think of it, its also funny how people like this are shamelessly lamenting that they will no longer have a place to bring their kids and read for hours without buying anything... HEY FOLKS, there is a magical place called the library that was actually created expressly for this purpose!! Stores, on the other hand, are for buying things, mmmm kay?  Users/ScottMeehleib

20110722 12:15:09 nbsp As of the 22nd, the up to 40% sale prices arent particularly compellingfor the books I wanted Amazon still had a lower price before sales tax. The genre sections are only 10%20% off. Their best deal might be Blurays that are marked at 40%, but Borders has never had a wide Bluray selection.  Users/AndrewPotter

20110811 00:33:32 nbsp Was anyone else there when they had those cool $1 racks? Most of the stuff in there was crap, but I found some really cute YA novels for my sister and a cool Kill Billstyle vamp/horror novel for me! Users/nutmeg
