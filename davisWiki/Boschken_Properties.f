20110307 15:05:11 nbsp Anybody have any feedback on these guys? My partner and I are looking for a place, somebody must have an experience to share... Users/MeggoWaffle

20140102 23:10:20 nbsp I have leased a condo from Kit Boschken at Boschken Properties for over 4 years now. There is not a better property manager in all of Davis! Any issue that has ever arisen (i.e. a leak under the sink, fridge compressor kicking the bucket, getting locked out, A/C going out) Kit was on top of it. Never once have I had to wait to hear a response, even on weekends, to any issue big or small. I cannot say enough great things about her. I highly recommend Kit to anyone! She rocks.
