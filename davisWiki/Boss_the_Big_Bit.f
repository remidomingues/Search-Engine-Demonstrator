Boss the Big Bit is Users/TeddyBriggs Teddy Briggs, Users/AndrewBell Andrew Bell, and Users/GonzaloEyzaguirre Gonzalo Eyzaguirre  rocking live since April 2005 with their electic mix of electronic indie nintendo goodness. They usually have drums (or drum machine), keyboards, guitar and vocals. Theyre a fun party band and Black Box was high on the KDVS charts for summer 2005, mostly because theyre friends with a lot of DJs but also because they rock so hard. The band formed in Davis, but now most (all?) of the band members live together in Sacramento, but still play shows in Davis.
