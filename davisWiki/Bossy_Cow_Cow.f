Bossie Cow Cow is one of the cheers used mainly by the Aggie Band. Also, a little dance goes with it, but it cant be described with common words, so to witness it, just keep an eye on the Banduh at football games. The cow referenced in the cheer developed into a fullfledged character (AKA Hamburger Patty), and in the 1990s, many students wanted Bossy to replace the mustang as the official UCD mascots mascot, much to the chagrin of older alumni.

Its an adaptation of an old UC Berkeley Berkeley cheer (remember, UC Davis used to be part of UC Berkeley Cal) that went:
>Oski WowWow! / Whiskey WeeWee! / Olee! Muckieeye! / Olee! Berkeleyeye! / California! Wow!<

Bossie Cow Cow was first introduced in 1926 at the football game against College of the Pacific.  The history of the cheer can be found on wiki:WikiPedia:The_Oski_Yell The Oski Yell and on the UC Davis Spirit Squad http://www.aggiepack.com/pages/spirit_squad/dance/Alumni/Alumni60s.htm history page.

Each year at the Picnic Day Admin Luncheon, the university and citys top leaders recite and dance to this song.
