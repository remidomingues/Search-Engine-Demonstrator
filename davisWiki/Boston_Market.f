http://www.bostonmarket.com/index.jsp Boston Market used to be located in the The Marketplace, at 1491 Covell Blvd.  It was the first of the franchise to be located on the West Coast.

They occupied the building that stands apart on the southern border of the parking lot.  It was later Original Petes, another Departed Businesses departed business. Currently (late 2005), a Panda Express.

The Boston Market chain, acquired by McDonalds after a 1999 Bankruptcy, closed many of its stores which were not performing well financially. Boston Market was originally called Boston Chicken but renamed sometime around 1995ish. In 2007, Boston Market was sold to Sun Capital Partners.

Q. Does anyone know if McDonalds therefore owns the real estate outright or at least a longterm lease on the premises? Users/JaimeRaba jr A. You could phone them...
