The Botany Club is an student organizations campus organization to promote botany, plant biology, College of Agriculture agriculture, and all other green related majors much as the chemistry club exists for chemistry majors, physics club, etc. The meetings occur biweekly and include various talks, presentations, and panels about plantrelated careers, research done here on campus, and other fascinating botanical discoveries and oddities.  They also sometimes join the Davis Botanical Society for bigger events and speakers  think of the DBS as the adult botany club!  They have been known to have special tours of the Herbarium  a squashed plant archive on campus  and the Botanical Conservatorys collection of unusual plants.  Major field trips happen each year.  See the website for plans.

The club http://wwwplb.ucdavis.edu/botanyclub/ website will generally have the calendar of events, speakers and trips.  Contact info should be there for the club officers, and is always true for the advisor, Professor Judy Jernstadt and the mascot Ernesto Sandoval.

They also have a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200621521 facebook group.

Meetings
All meetings held in Robbins Hall room Robbins Hall 141 141, starting near 6:15 p.m. every other Thursday, there is usually food brought by some member, and most often a panel or talk by someone relevant to plant biology, agriculture, or plants in general, great fun if you like the greener (or generally more colorful) side of life, a definitely awesome place for anyone in any plant related field.
