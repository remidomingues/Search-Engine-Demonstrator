Bower Bird is closed. There is a childrens clothing store in its place now.





Nothing that you need, but everything you want.

Bower Birds are collectors, so if you have kindred tendencies this gift shop may be for you. They have antiques, French soaps and lotions, unique jewelry, ribbon, and various trinkets for sale.

Come visit Deborahs resident Zebra Finches!


Walked by the store today, it was cleared out and empty.
