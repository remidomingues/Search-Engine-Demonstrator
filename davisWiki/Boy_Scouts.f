Davis Boy Scouts and Venturing are scouting organizations who used to have a cool Boy Scout Cabin; the Boy Scout Cabin lease was canceled and the City of Davis bought out the remaining lease because local troop leaders were unwilling to adopt an adult leadership policy in direct opposition to the national organization. The troop leaders feared that the national organization would merely cancel the troops charters in response. Some of the troop leaders lobby heavily for a change in the national policy and helped drive the local council to adopt a progressive policy in comparison to the current national policy. Local troops have committed themselves to refusing to implement the national policy.  No openly gay leaders or members have ever been removed from any troop in Davis due to their sexual orientation. The local troops are a part of the Golden Empire Council. Atheists and agnostics have also been required to resign from scouting, as members and volunteers, and have had Eagle Scout eagle scout rank denied. Some troops ignore this provision.

Effective January 1, 2014, the Boy Scouts of America has changed its membership policy to state  ...No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone. http://www.scouting.org/sitecore/content/membershipstandards/resolution/resolution.aspx

Boy Scouts of America are the oldest of the scouting organizations in Davis, having been established in 1920.

All Boy Scout Troops and Venturing Crews in Davis cooperate every year to run the Boy Scout Christmas Tree Lot http://www.davischristmastrees.com/. For decades the lot was downtown at the Boy Scout Cabin, but after leaving in 2002 they have moved several times. They are now located in the vacant lot across from the South Davis Nugget and the South Davis Fire Station on the corner of Mace and Cowell Blvd.


20060417 23:39:00 nbsp The way the main part of this entry is phrased, it sounds like the Boy Scouts national stand on Homosexuality is an act against humanity. Users/CarlosOverstreet
  as an Eagle Scout from the days before this policy was an issue, it is an act against humanity.  But the National organization has (in my opinion) always had policies that are acts against humanity.   Users/RocksandDirt

20060715 08:02:22 nbsp Funny that you should say that... because it sure seems to be. This is coming from a former sea scout. Users/KarlMogel

20060715 11:49:48 nbsp Is the policy a Dont Ask Dont Tell or do they actively try to determine the sexuality of their members?  Users/SteveOstrowski
  20060715 13:25:55 nbsp I was asked my sexual orientation at my Eagle Scout board of review.  Users/CarlosOverstreet
     20060715 13:27:09 nbsp Is that typical of all members, was it a question asked on a form or in person?   Users/SteveOstrowski
       20060715 14:45:59 nbsp The question of my sexual orientation was never on any of my official papers for membership or my Eagle Project, but the chairman of my board of review verbally in front of a panel asked me this question. From what I understand the restriction is to leadership roles in the BSA which includes both adult and scout leaders. While the organization dosent actively search for homosexuals in the organization, should someone talk about their orientation, its up to the local leaderâ€™s discretion as to whether to persue the matter. A few years back the school district and the city took a negative stance toward the boy scouts and our troop was forced to relocate since we were no longer allowed to use public land for meetings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America Boy Scout Controversies should give you a good overview of the situation.     Users/CarlosOverstreet
     20060715 16:03:35 nbsp To ask you about your sexual orientation was incorrect and you could have appropriately declined to answer.  Troop leaders are not supposed to discuss anything regarding sex or sexuality with the Scouts, but instead refer these matters to their parents.   Users/SharlaDaly
     20070316 10:47:41 nbsp I am an Eagle Scout, and the issue never came up.  I agree with Sharla.  Your own personal sexual orientation as a scout is not something that I think they usually take into consideration. Users/DavidGrundler

20091115 20:31:56 nbsp Hello  Who can tell me about young adult entrylevel scouting?  I am a young adult with (unfortunately) no previous scouting experience.  I am a hiker and naturalist, and I would like to join some boyscouttype group if any exist that will accept me. Users/GregPThrasher

20100208 17:35:29 nbsp You can look into leadership/volunteer roles at any of the local troups, depending on your age. But if you are just looking for a outdoors club I would consider the sierra club.  Users/matiasek
