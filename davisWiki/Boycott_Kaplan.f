List off the reasons why people should boycott Kaplan Educational Center Kaplan:

1. Wiki: Kaplan Excellence in Student Teamwork Award They snubbed the wiki.

This seems really childish and reactionary to me. (aside from #3, which I think everyone can agree is annoying!)  Users/PhilipNeustrom

  I talked to the head of Davis Kaplan about it. The wiki wasnt even a nominee. I guess the just didnt understand what the wiki was or they just wanted to give it to students who had the intelligence to form a group just to have something about it on their resume. the Building Roles guys each won three awards that night. Ill forward you the email that I sent to Rosanne of SPAC and Nan of Kaplan. If the http://cim.ucdavis.edu/clinics/imani/ Imani clinic which gives out free medicine to people in Oak Park or the http://www.shifaclinic.org/ Shifa Clinic would have won i would have no problem. But my real anger is who Kaplan feels is the noblest and most righteous organization. And that is a reason to boycott them. Users/RobRoy

    What do you mean not a nominee?  You mean it didnt qualify in the first place?

     No, you qualified. But the wiki wasnt even in the top 20 contenders. Picnic Day was though.
     What boggles my mind iswhy not?  This Wiki is the MOST collaborative project Davis has ever seen.  It brings together such diverse groups, and does a lot to make Davis more accessible and livable.  And thats not to mention how it opens up lines of communication that previously did not exist.  I have a strong suspicion that the evaluating committee failed to make its assessments on the bases that it claimed in advertising the contest. It also calls into question whether they followed California Business and Professions Code sections 1753917539.3, 17539.35, if applicable.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
     How were we not in the top 20 contenders??  Did they even bother to check out the website?  It sounds as if they didnt do much research into anything they didnt immediately recognize.  I smell a rat.  Users/KalenRidenour

2. Some allege that they teach rich kids how to cheat, although several former Kaplan students dispute that there is anything that is technically cheating.  These people, after all, want to compete fair and square, right?
   Could someone flesh out the details of the accusation?  I always heard that Kaplan and Princeton Review (and whatnot) were socially bad because in the course of proving they could teach to the test and raise people scores, over the years proliferation testprep has been causing scores to rise, while those for whom testprep is inaccessible get left in the dust.  So my question is whether cheating is used figuratively above, speaking to the way testprep cheats the objectivity assessment system? Users/JaimeRaba jr
   I took the MCAT prep course that Kaplan offers.  Im not proud of admitting it, but I would do it again in a heartbeat.  They didnt teach me how to cheat, and, if they had tried, I would have reported them to http://www.aamc.org the AAMC.  Everyone takes http://www.aamc.org/students/mcat/start.htm the MCAT seriously, even Kaplan.  I do agree with the sentiment that they leave the less fortunate out of the loop.  If I hadnt been able to afford the class, I dont think I would have done as well on the exam.  Thats just me, though. Users/NiareeHopelian
    Okay, so perhaps whoever made the comment was just referring to how test prep reinforces classism.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

3. Students have observed thousands of Kaplans flyers that have been placed on campus boards, which violates SPAC policy and harms the forests. In addition, they do not seem to have an issue with putting up an excessive amount of flyers on a single board by covering up the flyers for real student organizations and events.
    If Im not mistaken, since Kaplan isnt a student organization, shouldnt it be outside the oversight of SPAC?  I think there is a broader campus policy to govern commercial advertising... which Kaplan also likely violates.  Any thoughts?
     It is under the oversight of SPAC, because thats the most convenient place for the University to put it.  (http://spac.ucdavis.edu/policies.htm source)
    In what way does this harm the forests?
    This shouldnt be an issue anymore, as the boss lady is pretty strict about following SPAC policy... must have been someone from a long time ago...

    Yeah, well, Im still not sure if thats a SPAC rule or SPACs rearticulation of a university policy found elsewhere.  After all, how is SPAC going to fine Kaplan?  Shut off their SPAC mailbox?  Freeze their SPAC recharge account?  Oh wait, they dont have one.
