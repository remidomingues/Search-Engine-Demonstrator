Brad is an infamous IRC troll. Beware, or he might pwn your silly ass.

When hes not busy Xtrolling Users/WilliamLewis and Users/JessicaRockwell in Davis Wiki IRC #daviswikiX sleeping hes prolly Xdoing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift deadlifts or telling you and everybody else how wonderful deadlifts are.  He also enjoys working on his http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength grip strength so he can crush his girlfriend.X complaining about being tired.

He also has a long moustache that he does not usually comb.  He likes lolcats.  He likes strength training and knows that biceps are not the only muscles in the male body.  Deadlifts!  Erector spinae! Hip flexors!  He is the manager of a truck repair shop, though he knows nothing about truck repair.  He loves his http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_E30 E30, but it has been getting crappier since he moved to Davis.  He gets pissed off when he cant park it because some asshole decided their car was good enough for TWO parking spots.

Also, my attention to detail is appreciated on this wiki.

20070927 23:05:02 nbsp Its funny that you get my mail considering I had thought I had changed everything and I also did the address change thingy at the Post Office. I still live in the complex so if its bothering you, let me know. (Im only two apartments down, ending in 0 instead of 2). Sorry for checking your comment so late, i never check my own page on here. Users/RachelPeters

20110327 21:55:38 nbsp De tail is always appreciated.  Glad to hear youre doing well. Users/JabberWokky
  Thanks.  I miss Davis though.  And having free time.  In Rio Linda nobody would dare try to ban leaf blowers.  Noise?  Pfft.  You cant hear them over the neighbors straightpiped 6.6L GTO or motorcycle that they seem to be idling/revving 24/7.  Pollution?  Not a big deal when you consider the aforementioned GTO.  Kicking up dust?  Im sure the daily motorcycle races on residential streets with children playing in them kick up more dust than a leaf blower!   Users/BradBenedict

20110327 22:03:37 nbsp Sometimes I dont even like boners when they are my own. Like when I wake up and I have to pee really bad but I cant.  Users/hankim
  Or when youre in high school and you have one and the bell rings to change classes.  Even though nobody has ever noticed it tucked into your waist band before, youre still worried about it.   Users/BradBenedict
   Especially when youre wearing a short tshirt. Users/hankim

20110327 23:19:51 nbsp you come out the cuts Users/StevenDaubert
  I dont even know what that means.  Ive been MIA?  Users/BradBenedict

20121010 01:05:50 nbsp The slice of Brads life I experienced was very small, but every experience I had with him was positive and memorable.  Rest in peace, Brad. Users/PhilipNeustrom
