Connections to Davis: Visited while on vacation to California for the first time in June 2004 and ever since have come back usually around the May/June time frame. Crepeville is usually one of my favorite places to eat at especially for breakfast. I also visit the Davis Anime Club on both nights as well. I also visit http://www.scruzwiki.org Santa Cruz and see friends in the nearby town of wiki:WikiPedia:Aptos,_California Aptos. While in the area, I usually stay at the http://www.norcalhostels.org/sac Sacramento YHA which is a pretty nice place in downtown Sacramento.

While I am in Davis, I usually like to do some bicycling around especially around the UC Davis area  but also explore the various bike paths in town.

Kind of interesting item, I have been on the Wiki since beginning of 2005 and now as of this edit, it it March 2013 ! Since 2004, I have been coming to Davis every year and includes going to Santa Cruz as well. Have a few friends there. It is amazing that this Wiki has been here for almost 10 years ! I hope I can keep on planning to come to Davis once per year usually in the Spring. I need to try to come to Davis like in other parts of the year !

Some of my favorite places are  Crepeville and foreign food places and some bars that are outdoors as well.
