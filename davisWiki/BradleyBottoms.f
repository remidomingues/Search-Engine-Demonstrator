20130114 13:35:30 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  Please dont delete the link to the National Organization for Women on the NOW page.  The National Organization for Women is a very longlived and wellknown organization, and it is confusing to have NOW only link to the campus group.  Not to mention that it is common to have such disambiguation links on the wiki.  So, unless the campus NOW is actually affiliated with the National Organization for Women, please stop deleting the link and the reference. Users/CovertProfessor
  Update: Users/gcoville created a disambiguation page, so that NOW more clearly links to both pages.  Thats probably a better solution than what I was doing.  Please respect this change.   Users/CovertProfessor
