20080317 22:10:32 nbsp Well, the davis course is pretty weak.  that being said, its within biking distance and is a nice lunch time distraction.  However, if you want real golf you need to drive.  There is a pretty good one off of hazel in far distant sac.  But there is a much better one outside of napa which isnt too much father time wise (other direction, of course).  There is also a new course before fairfield which Ive never played...  Stafford lake (I think) has a long course as well thats fun (but the napa one is the best Ive played within a one hour driveish) Users/WesHardaker

20080320 09:38:23 nbsp Clap Clap Clap Much thanks for the photos! Users/JabberWokky

20080406 23:05:05 nbsp Elk grove?  no...  didnt even know that one existed, to be honest.  I need to get out and play some more!

Yeah, Ive thought for a long time Davis should put one in a bigger park.  The problem is you need trees (ideally) and they wont use an existing park with trees, so wed be stuck trying to get them to use a bunch of bulldozers to make nonflat land.  I doubt youd ever get permission to put one near the river, unfortunatley. Users/WesHardaker

20080408 12:38:31 nbsp Thats a darn huge pdf for such a small course... Users/WesHardaker

20080409 22:25:33 nbsp many moar bike paths in East Davis eh?

They pail in comparison to the North Davis system Users/StevenDaubert

20080409 22:29:30 nbsp Eh, the average East Davis greenbelt is like the ones in South Davis, a good path with terrible sides, some parks and some rolling grass areas... I just think the North Davis greenbelts are bigger and better... The South / East Davis ones seem like afterthoughts to me... Users/StevenDaubert

20080411 15:59:42 nbsp No worries... but there is a whole hour of time left.  ;P  Knowing how most volunteer groups work, I had a vision of somebody rushing as fast as they could to finish by the deadline, hit the wiki for some bit of info and not being able to find the link. Users/JabberWokky

20080411 17:45:36 nbsp Feel free... I just left it there to see how it looked (and kind of as a seed for the next Featured Entry). Users/JabberWokky

20080413 08:22:46 nbsp yes im there once in a while. However, since i do most of my research in ecology, Ive been spending an increasing amount of time in storer. But occasionally im still in the math undergrad room. Users/MattHh

20080512 13:25:07 nbsp thanks for doing your part to keep Davis boring. Users/PxlAted

20080617 23:51:45 nbsp I think Ive seen a GM cert tag somewhere around town, I just cant recall Users/StevenDaubert

20080724 06:38:13 nbsp Thanks for the info. Yeah, Im mostly living there since its the cheapest option available, but judging from the comments people are leaving on its wiki page, Im going to be in for a rough year... Users/SMCareBare

20080724 15:27:56 nbsp Well, if it is nice out, you can take them whiffling through the tulgey wood, and have them study by the Tumtum tree, standing awhile in thought... Users/IDoNotExist

20081124 18:14:22 nbsp I know.  I was just playing along with that. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20081205 10:14:25 nbsp Hah, if Id only waited another day! :) Id only meant to archive the last one. . . then I saw all the others that were missing. Its like cleaning up after roommates; you just keep find things and wishing youd just left it alone. Users/KevinChin

20090505 15:03:43 nbsp In regard to your fishing license question: yes, you have to wear it. If youve got it clipped to your hat, back, shirt, w/e a fish and game warden can see it from far away and wont have to come bug you.  From what I understand they often find a comfortable spot with a good view and sit there with a pair of binoculars. Users/MasonMurray
