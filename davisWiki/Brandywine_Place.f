Brandywine Place is a street in West Manor named after wiki:WikiPedia:Brandywine Creek, a tributary of the wiki:WikiPedia:Christina River in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Like other streets in West Manor it is Street Name Themes named after a waterway. It is nearby Village Homes where streets are named after features in wiki:WikiPedia:Middle Earth. In the Shire in Middle Earth is also a river called Brandywine, so some might assume this street is in Village Homes. However the neighborhoods are only connected by Bike Paths bicycle paths between Arlington Boulevard and Russell Boulevard. Because Village Homes has no through streets, if you go in by car looking for Brandywine you must leave the way you came, or find Bombadil Lane Tom Bombadil for help.
