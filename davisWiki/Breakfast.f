20070903 14:37:27 nbsp This page should probably be pared down to omit all the cafes and bagel places that happen to be open early in the morning. There are hordes of them and their inclusion makes it hard to find the restaurants that offer an actual sitdown breakfast or brunch. Comments welcome. Users/HenryHouse

20100813 12:07:54 nbsp Any recommendations for a fairly nice Sunday brunch around 11 or 11:30?  My folks are coming for a visit.  Seasons looks like one good option, but are there any other thoughts? Users/TomGarberson
