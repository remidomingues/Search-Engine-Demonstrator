20100304 18:26:19 nbsp Its also great that theyre graffiting on campus buildings to protest budget shortages.  Great way to save money!  Make them do an expensive cleanup and raise student fees more, whee! Users/TomGarberson

20100305 15:08:36 nbsp I have no particular vocal stance on this subject, but as much as protest can work, of the number of protests that have ever been conducted vs. the number of times it has worked is no where near optimistic. Mostly because of how the protesters conduct themselves. In this particular case, delaying traffic and costing the city (and the citizens, who may have ended up late to work) money isnt exactly the smartest move, but that really wasnt the purpose of their actions. It was to get attention to their cause (as ironic as it was). Users/SunjeetBaadkar
