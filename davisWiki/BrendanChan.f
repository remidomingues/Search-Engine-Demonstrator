20080808 19:23:56 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. The Students for Concealed Carry on Campus page sure looks interesting. Sometimes it can be tiring to see the same arguments rehashed and rehashed and rehashed, but forward progress slowly is occurring. Maybe you can link to Campus Border Signs and http://www.ahumanright.com/? Users/JasonAller

  Thanks for the suggestion, Jason. Users/BrendanChan

20081215 23:55:33 nbsp OMG...it is the BEST CASINO BUFFET AROUND! They have food from all around the world...kind of expensive tho...I would go during the end of their lunch and stay for dinner :) Users/ArianeMetz

20081220 22:45:32 nbsp I got some death sauce in my eye once accidentally... it sucked

I just had no tolerance for spice, so I went all out. Now I enjoy a wide variety of spicy things Users/StevenDaubert

  Yeah, been there and done that too (crushed red pepper though, not half as bad).

Spicy food is life. Users/BrendanChan

Yeah, it was a an incidental transfer, I made myself some chicken at TapEx, threw some death sauce on it, washed my hands, ate the chicken,  played some DDR, biked home and then half hour later I was on the computer chatting and I rubbed my eye... seconds later it started to tingle and I said oh  and flushed my eye for days, it sucked. A  buddy of mine makes this habanero rum sauce that was homemade. Oh man it was sweet and then 5 seconds later it went fwoomp and it got low level insane hot. The other thing is this particular sauce stacked (has  a cumualitive effect that makes it get progressively hotter)

good times StevenDaubert

20090114 13:34:37 nbsp Hey, I just wanted to say Im not trying to make anything personal.  I just find the topic really interesting.  In a lot of controversial topics, people tend to requote listed information (especially from pro/anti websites with obvious bias), and it tends to get distorted, misread, or misquoted.  And often, people dont check their sources. I hate to see misinformation spread.   (Which is why I left such a long response to Olivia).  Now, the interesting thing about the law school incident is what if those two officers had been able to carry guns onto campus? I could see someone making that argument as a reason for guns on campus.  Regarding this case specifically though, Id say nothing as he opened fire at point blank inside the deans office and no one could have prevented that, but in other situations it could potentially equate to a faster response time.   Users/EdWins
  Thats true. I agree that no one could have prevented the shootings inside the deans office, but casualties were kept to a minimum. Had the shooter been allowed to continue, two eightround magazines make for a lot of trouble. Users/BrendanChan
