Brendan Crotty is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2013 ASUCD Election running on the BEST slate.

Facebook Event Statement

My name is Brendan Crotty, 4th year Theater and Communication major and UCD 2013 ASUCD Senate candidate running with the BEST slate.

As a leader, I have to lead from within and strive for excellence in myself before asking it of others. As an example, I created and maintain UC Davis Ubisoft, feel free to like the page. http://www.facebook.com/UC.Davis.Ubisoft?frefts

I want to encourage students to utilize our campus and engage in campus life without hesitation. TAPS strikes fear into any student who tries to park on campus, limiting student involvement. Aggies shouldnâ€™t be scared to park. As Senator Crotty, I will end campus ticketing past 5pm on Fridays.

Please help me become a leader on our campus.

Vote Brendan Crotty #1 for ASUCD Senate & BEST #25
