Brenden Theatres is a small company and only has a few theaters. Brenden began in 1990 in Pittsburg, California and the Vacaville theater was the third theater to be opened. The headquarters and flagship theater used to be the Concord, California theater which was the second theater to open. It was later changed to the Las Vegas theater. The President of the company is a very nice person and used to visit each movie theater from time to time. He was always open to suggestions from any of his employees.


20070506 00:25:12 nbsp It is worth it to drive down to Brenden Theatres Vacaville to see movies if the theaters in Davis are sold out. It is right off of the freeway. The THX certified surround sound is amazing and the movie screens are huge. They use real butter on their popcorn. There are always lots of movies and showtimes. They dont sell out of tickets as much as Regal Natomas. Users/Jedron

20080630 23:00:15 nbsp great theater to see a movie. I do, however, find the president (johnny brendan) to be incredibly obnoxious. during the premovie slideshow, every other slide was was about johnny brendan, and it was worded in a way that made it seem as though he was the one who wrote them, and was talking in the third person. imagine bob dole meets derek zoolander.

20100210 14:22:57 nbsp Brenden Theaters is a really nice, modern theater. They play all of the current films, including some indie releases, and while the parking lot can get really full Ive never had a movie sell out on me. This theater is somewhat pricey, but the student and matinee prices are reasonable. Users/bear
