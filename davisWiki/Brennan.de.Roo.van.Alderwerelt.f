Il vaut mieux que tu prennes un parapluie, parce quil Rain pleut.


20110827 13:25:46 nbsp Hey, thanks for solving that little mystery.  Our home is now listed as a gaming venue on Meetup.com for similar reasons, and Ive been writing RPG books using my home address as my business address, and so I was very curious as to what Frozen Caveman Games was.  Also, its not raining, but thanks for the advice. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
