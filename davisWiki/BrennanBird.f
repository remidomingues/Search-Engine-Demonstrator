 Brennan Blazer Bird 

Â¡Hola, me llamo Brennan! I enjoy rock climbing, bicycling for long distances, playing guitar and drumming in circles. I also love buildering and tree climbing. I probably hold the record for reaching the highest natural place in Davis. I am a backpacking guide for Outdoor Adventures and the compost operations director for Project Compost. I love making art, particularly within the 2dimensional realms of drawing and painting. I am a geology major and an avid numerologist. Reggae is almost always my musical release. I am the third bird. My biggest life issue is balancing all my interests without spreading myself too thin. Selfdiscipline is my greatest struggle and most sought after freedom.

Need compost? bbbird@ucdavis.edu



20090105 18:14:10 nbsp I havent really got past the planning stage on the Solar Oven, saw some abandoned ovens and thought about using those for a shell, but I should probably find a design 1st. The solar dehydrator is done, but Ill have to wait till spring to test it out. How far did you get? Users/AlexMandel
