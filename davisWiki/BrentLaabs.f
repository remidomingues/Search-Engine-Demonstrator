Brent Laabs is the former Legislative Chair for the http://nagps.org/ National Association of GraduateProfessional Students, and a longtime editor of this here Davis Wiki.

Back in 2008, Brent moved back to SoCal so he can not work on wiki:ventura Ventura Wiki.  His current wiki project is https://allthetropes.orain.org/ All The Tropes, a fork of the TV Tropes website with less arbitrary administrator decisions and less censorship.  Were like TV Tropes before they started deleting pages.

He currently works as a software developer for a web company specializing in human resources development.   There, he uses his {{{P++++$}}} abilities (see Geek Code Block below).

 About Brent

  The 94^th^ registered user on the Front Page Davis Wiki
  Wikivangelists Wikivangelist
  Contributor to the http://rakudo.org Rakudo http://perl6.org/ Perl 6 compiler.

Brent resigned after a vote of no confidence passed in UCSA, making him once again (albeit temporarily) a private citizen.  Brent apparently spent too much time representing the students of the UC System and not enough time representing UCSA.  He then went on to represent all grad students in the U.S. as the Legislative Chair for NAGPS, even though he was no longer a student.  Lobbying 10 congressional offices a day can get tiring, though.

Brent used to be a student in the Atmospheric Science grad program but had to leave because he was http://www.timecube.com/ educated stupid.  He used to be a TA for Atmospheric Science for ATM 10, 110, and 111, and also for Sociology 3.

Brent was a candidate for ASUCD Fake Senate on the Squelch! slate.  You can read his /Issues issues if you want, most of which he will tried to achieve this year.  Especially the trebuchets.

He is also a vendor of some of the Magic Items of Davis.  He will only buy magic items at half of book price, however.  Hes got a lot of http://www.dorktower.com/2001/01/25/comicsarchive60/ roleplaying experience.  He sort of founded Psi Phi, but never really had enough time to get it going.  Be smart: Avoid Zombie Attack Response Guide zombie attack!

He taught a Propaganda class for Experimental College during Spring quarter 2005 entitled Propaganda: How to make it and how to spot it.  The Propaganda Class will forever be known as the best class ever taught at UCD!  We have many satisfied students, some of which went on the fasttrack to ASUCD power.

Brent has spent enough time around ASUCD that he now says things like Point of order, I yield, and Question in text in normal conversation.  He has managed to avoid being sent to that ASUCD Gulag  so far.  He was a Campaign Manager for SOSSS, Friends Urging Campus Kindness, and the United Student Alliance, but he is currently a member of FOSL in ASUCD.  However, he was a plussecret advisor for the Christian Slate, because all your bill are belong to us.  He was probably also a member of LEAD, just not all the time.

Brent is a patriot, and loves Big Brother very much.  Brent will do anything to help America defeat the Mideastasian menace!

He wants to be the very best, Ketchum Institute for PokÃ©mon Studies like no one ever was.

He enjoys semantic arguments greatly, employing arguments common to enthusiastic nerds worldwide, thereby keeping fellow wiki editors engaged in an otherwise content online landscape.  He has been known to employ the Arlen Method at times.


 Internet Presence 
  His AIM is {{{TheLabster}}}
  Email: MailTo(bslaabs AT gmail DOT TT com)
  http://brentlaabs.com/ BrentLaabs.com actually redirects to this page
  Im on The Facebook too.  This is an extremely bad way to contact me.
  He has a http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tropers/BrentLaabs profile page over on TV Tropes, but hes banned so he cant edit it.
  If you feel like comparing yourself to him in cheesy internet tests, look him up on his http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid14859971154627253851 OkCupid profile.
  In the http://www5.kingdomofloathing.com/ Kingdom of Loathing, an adventurer is he! Hes playing again, but somewhat irregularly. Hes Doctor Fettuccini (#522002), http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Order_of_the_Silver_Wossname K.S.W.

20090415 01:08:02 nbsp Hi Brent, in terms of the battle of bands, I really dont want to engage in an edit war. But it is simply untrue to say that the Banduh cheats their opponents in the battle. I explained on WilliamLewiss page that the wiki page dedicated to the battle is confusing and has several inaccuracies. In its current state, its probably not the best page to base statements on the featured page off of. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the facts with you, on account of I am somebody who was actually present during the wee hours of the night for some of the battles in question. While I think it is healthy for people to have a discussion, such a discussion obviously doesnt belong in the form of reverts on the featured page. Therefore, since there is not consensus on this issue, I propose leaving the featured page text neutral for the time being and allow any necessary discussion on an appropriate page. Users/RyanCoates

20090415 02:04:54 nbsp The rule that the Aggie Band always wins is not really a rule, people sort of just say that because they have never lost. In the case of an agreed tie, each band plays their fight song in order. Tradition is that the Banduh is always the last band to march into the PD battle, therefore they are the last to play their fight song in the case of a tie. If they played their fight song first, then they would have played one fewer songs than the other bands and it wouldnt be much of a tie. I can see how to an audience this would appear like the Banduh was winning a tie, so to speak, but thats not really whats happening. In the absence of a tie agreement, the battle becomes winnable. That the Aggie Band always wins is not really a rule, but more of a creed among Aggie bandsmen. Some other band could plausibly come with more music and stamina and outlast the Banduh. Some have tried this, but have been unable to exhaust the Banduhs library. Just because nobody has yet been able to outplay the Ags doesnt that they couldnt or wont in the future. Users/RyanCoates

20090430 18:46:36 nbsp I prototyped a little threaded shadow site called Mondo (a type of border grass... get it?

It was very dwiki specific at the time, and ran on PHP/adodb.  I never got to linking the user accounts, as I was noodling through ideas and never found one I really liked. Users/JabberWokky

Look, Brent. Im too dumb at this wiki stuff to know how to revert pages and all that. I barely know how to make revisions. But public record is public record, and there is nothing wrong with listing the names of those who voted on those days. I do not object to my name being listed at the bottom of the letter I wrote. Anyway, not sure what your intent was with that, but please let me know what would be agreeable to you.
I figured out the revert thing. What do you think of this version? I modified the intro so that it was as neutral as I could make it. Cameron

20100217 00:57:00 nbsp Do ASUCD members really have any power over campus printing, readers, wireless internet in the dorms, infrastructure maintenance, or anything else promised? Every election I hear a few of the same issues repeated and it seems like the people who got elected never kept their end of the bargain. To me, it looks like they have no more power over these issues than the average student and the only way to get these issues looked at would be to apply as a student adviser to the Chancellor or something and these promises are used to feed on ignorant voters (loaded question is loaded). Users/hankim
 Well, yes and no.  I can give you some sort of answer about student representation on CCFIT for and other Administrative Advisory Committees, and that would be factual but not really relevetory.  So far as I can tell, your philosophy of student government is that it should be restrained to things in which the association has a direct fiscal influence (or maybe some external advocacy too, not sure there).  Those are the places where the association has hard power.  But there are also areas in which they have soft (diplomatic) power, and the provision of student services by the campus administration is one of those places.
 Students are ultimately the consumers of the University, so there are a variety of ways student leaders can wield soft power.  They can attempt to embarass the administration, either by extensive protests or scathing editorials (see UCSA).  They can try to tattle to the Regents.  They can shmooze their way to getting inside attention (see Brian McInnis).  Or, more than likely, they will just sufficiently annoy the administration that theyll do something about it (see Rob Roy, or even Keith Shively).  The point is, soft power is real, and providing Stapler Liberation Front staplers in computer labs is not something that would have happened without student leadership.
 That said, soft power is unreliable, even from the best wielders of it.  So I think you should look carefully at the person making a lot of promises that they need others to deliver on.  If its someone without the social graces to shmooze, the persistence to annoy, and the eloquence to indict, then their promises will likely remain pieinthesky.  Contrarily, if the candidate promises only things that they know they can deliver, its really kind of boring.  It shows a lack of vision for what student life should be.  Its possible, even in this poor economic climate, to get computer lab printing back up to 200 pages/quarter  but it would take the kind of tenacity I rarely see in a student government officer.   Users/BrentLaabs
  It would be really easy to get computer lab printing up to 200 pages/quarter. ASUCD could budget a chunk of money to hand to CLM. wl
   And yet Id just assume that the people increasing fees at double the rate of inflation pay for it, not the student government who hasnt raised fees since 1979. BL
  So there is not much error in my assuming that the average student can have as much power as someone who is a part of the ASUCD as long as they are a sufficiently large enough thorn in the side of the UC higherups? Users/hankim
   Being a student government representative gives you a social context for representing the opinion of students  no more, no less.  Without the AS, youd want some kind of other social context, be it a student AAC position or just a club officership.  One caveat here is that campus officials tend to give more weight to officials higher up in the student government hierarchy, and city officials give slightly higher weight to ASUCD executives.  This distinction is completely lost at the state and national levels of advocacy, in my experience. BL

20120403 15:42:45 nbsp Well, I think its better if MW explains her comments, since I dont want to put words in her mouth.  However, I think the basic point is that some people, because of the color of their skin and the nature of our society, have experiences X, Y, and Z, and others, because they have a different color skin, have experiences A, B, and C.  As a result of their different experiences, one group may have difficulty seeing why something is problematic for another group, and because they cant see it, they brush it off.  I dont think its racist to point that out.

Did you come back to the wiki after all this time to argue about the Occupy movement and otherwise pick fights, or to add content? Users/CovertProfessor

20120403 17:40:08 nbsp Pretty sure I never called you a stupid white male. Thanks for putting words in my mouth, though. If you dont understand what check your privilege means, see http://bit.ly/HnlR7u here for clarification. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120403 20:26:24 nbsp Ok, I will take you at your word, then, and try to explain.  You said, I understand you may have racist views, but please keep them off of the wiki. This is a space where people should be respectful to one another, and work cooperatively to build consensus.

Saying that MW has racist view is hardly being respectful or conducive to working cooperatively.  You took the worst possible interpretation of what she said, an interpretation that you have yet to explain.  At your request, I explained to you why I thought her comments were not at all racist, but you havent responded to that, either.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120403 20:52:27 nbsp I am glad to see the productive edits; thank you.

Here is another reading of your exchange with MW:  I think her original comment was meant to inform; although you may not have heard the phrase check your privilege before, it is widely used, and she had no way of knowing that you hadnt heard it before.  Your response to her doesnt indicate that you didnt understand the phrase, but it does indicate that you were brushing off what she was saying with (as you say) a flippant comment.  So, then she says something that amounts to its all too easy to brush off a concern if you never had experiences that would allow you to fully understand the concern and you call her a racist.  I think that that was out of line on your part.  You admittedly didnt understand what she was saying at first, yet you somehow knew she was making a racist comment?  You later accused her of making an ad hominem.  How about trying the principle of charity, i.e., read what she said in the most charitable way possible, not the least charitable way possible? Users/CovertProfessor

20120404 09:14:04 nbsp Ok, let me try to explain how I see the issue with the term Occupy and perhaps that will help, although I am starting to fear that you are determined to see yourself as the wronged party no matter what I say.

Using the term Occupy for the name of the movement is, for some, similar or the same as using the names The Final Solution, Crusade (yes, I know about the organization on campus  dont get me started or Jihad. I might be a Native American whose people were kicked off of their land and shuttled to a reservation where no food would grow and where there was nothing to hunt.  I might have grown up in a culture that was completely demoralized, groping to resuscitate the tattered remains of that culture which the government sought to wipe out through education and reform.  I might have watched some of the members of my family deal with this through drugs and alcohol and watched others succeed in avoiding that fate only by leaving their people.  All of this as a result of those who proclaimed their right to occupy lands that belong to my ancestors.  And I might be one of the successful ones who fought my way to college and who has been trying ever since to bring the ongoing plight of my people to the attention of others.  So, when someone like that expresses a concern about the name Occupy and you reply, Those people might need to chill and realize that one cant get everything one asks for I might think that having to pay high tuition isnt the worst thing that can happen to someone.  I might wonder when my people will get anything that they asked for, and why our concerns are always, again and again, being brushed over.  I might hope that in a university community, people would at least listen to what I had to say and not just tell me to chill without considering my concerns  that they could disagree with me about the name of the movement, but that they should at least acknowledge where I am coming from and not just dismiss me and my concerns.  I might point out that that persons privileged position, based on their race and gender, is why they fail to see my concerns worthy of any consideration.  And if that person takes offense at me pointing this out, I might be inclined to say, those people need to chill and realize that having someone pointing out your privilege is not the worst thing that can happen to someone.

That is my genuine attempt to explain what has happened here.  If you still think you are entirely the wronged party... well, Im not sure what else I can say, other than I think you are sorely mistaken. Users/CovertProfessor

20120404 11:05:09 nbsp In fact, I think it does belong on the wiki.  I think youve played out a scenario that has occurred within the group itself, with some members dismissing the concerns about the name out of hand and others pointing out that this dismissal stems out of privilege. Users/CovertProfessor

20120404 11:21:19 nbsp I can, but honestly, at this point Im not inclined to.  Maybe later.  Right now I feel as though I have gone out of my way to explain things patiently and clearly with very little response to the substance of my comments on your part.  Id like to hear something from you other than your feelings about being personally attacked. Users/CovertProfessor

20120405 13:12:40 nbsp Well, yes, there is probably no point in continuing that particular conversation now.  However, I am quite annoyed that you kept asking questions, which I spent a fair amount of time answering, only to have you ignore them.  In the future I would expect you to actually engage in dialogues that you begin. Users/CovertProfessor

20120406 05:16:35 nbsp I never said a thing the whole time cause I knew you would speak for me

Thanks Users/StevenDaubert

20120406 07:54:12 nbsp Your long explanation on my page is all beside the point.  As I said to WL, I have no problem with principled and respectful disagreement over whether the term occupy is appropriate.  What I do object to is what you did initially  which was to completely dismiss the concerns with the line Those people might need to chill and realize that one cant get everything one asks for.  Now, if you want to say that you had in mind your pragmatic reasons all along, well, thats interesting, but not really relevant to others who cannot read your mind and who can only judge by your actions.  It is also exceedingly doubtful to me that anyone who really understood those concerns would say something dismissive like that (not to mention that you admitted that you didnt know of any use of the term occupy to imply oppression, so I am not sure how you can now claim to have reflected on those concerns).  Again, one can understand those concerns and still disagree with them, but one who simply dismisses those concerns is, I think, in a position where they have not suffered under an occupation.  And the gargantuan leap by where you come to call MW a racist  sorry, still not buying it, for the reasons I have already stated, and whatever you think of her tactics pragmatically has nothing to do with whether her statement was racist or not.  It wasnt. Users/CovertProfessor  P.S.  If you genuinely are a pragmatist, then you should not be making flippant, dismissive comments, as they tend to only inflame (as they have done here) rather than persuade.

20120524 08:03:27 nbsp Hey Brent, maybe you could help me out with the MIND Institute page? I work there, and several years ago the Institute actually officially changed its name to not have the periods between the letters. I went to rename the page, and thats how I found out there was that other page that had been created just last year with the now correct name. More pages linked to the old MIND Institute page so I instead tried to delete the new one and was then going to rename the old one to not have the periods between the letters. Ideas?

20131115 08:55:56 nbsp Why have you made a new page again out of Andrea Thomas? I dont like it, its like she is bullied all over again. She wants to get on with her life, isnt that clear? Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131115 15:01:18 nbsp I would be happy to oblige, but we must first clarify this. Brent, please tell me how you meant this text about Andrea Thomas. I was just expressing my opinion that I wouldnt be glad too if somebody would write that about me. My motive is compassion and yours? Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131116 11:08:05 nbsp In this case its not so much about (your exact) words, but about doing something very obvious against Andrea Thomas will: renewing and reinforcing (with new text) an old and lame ASUCD history. Andrea repeatedly, and at various points, made it clear that she doesnt like this page because it stands in the way of her future. This page makes (made) lame comments about her ASUCD past, her nonexisting, not showing up (when she should have) etc..

I agree with her that this is not funny at all, only to the people who made those comments. Maybe you werent aware of the situation?

So, you were putting her in the spotlight again, just at the time that she was returning and thanking everybody for doing the right thing and deleting the silly page and remarks. Only some insiders (?) find these remarks funny, but the person in question doesnt think it is funny and I doubt that outsiders would think it is funny or relevant for that matter.   Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131116 21:12:21 nbsp I dont understand this at all. Its just a minor thing and you could do Andrea Thomas a huge favor. This is not about censorship but making Davis Wiki friendly to both users and discussed. I am doing this for a fellow citizen.  I dont even know her, I would do it for anybody in this position. And I am not going anywhere. Is this Davis hospitality? :\ I hope not. But in this case: I give up. Just make this lame page about Andrea again. I am sorry Andrea, I do not receive enough backup to help you anymore.  Users/ConstantiaOomen
 I agree with Brent: Censor the Davis wiki b/c you are going to apply for a professional education? If that page gets someone DQd from med school / the bar / et al then maybe we all need to reevaluate those professional societies. Besides she did focus on what was important (school) and seemingly not care about what wasnt (ASUCD). Anyways shes awfully close to getting some sort of Streisand effect going on ~SD

20131121 21:53:55 nbsp (i still think my version was the best) You must be the most modest person in Davis, wow! :) Users/ConstantiaOomen

I dont understand. When I searched for Daniel Pfister before, my profile page didnt come up. Since I changed the page name, it comes up just fine. I changed Users/LourdesEBorrayo Lourdes because I know her quite well (youd know that if you read her profile) and shed asked for help. Shell be helping me edit my pages as well. Were happy to hear advice, but please dont reverse things that weve done on eachothers pages.  Thanks.  Daniel Pfister
 Yeah, I did read her page.  But its still a violation of social norms around here.  Forcing someone else to not have a user page, and only have a public page is a little gauche.  She might be okay with that, which is cool, but it is likely to give other editors the wrong idea.  Users/BrentLaabs
