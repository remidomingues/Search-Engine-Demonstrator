20101012 10:20:52 nbsp Hi Brett Anne, and a somewhat belated welcome to the wiki!  Great work putting together all the information on DPFS.  You can help keep things organized by making some of the DPFS pages into subpages like Davis Peoples Free School/Mission Statement and Davis Peoples Free School/How To Submit A Workshop or Event.  Renaming the pages youve already created is a cinch: just click edit on the existing page, click on the Rename button beneath the editing field, and enter the new name.  Also, dont forget to link between the pages!  If youd like any help, dont hesitate to ask. Users/TomGarberson

Hi Brett!  Please bear in mind that I have not taken a look through all of your recent edits, Ive just seen that you have many edits clumped together and I wanted to make sure you are aware of the please remember to preview Preview feature.  That, coupled with commenting your edits lets people tell at a glance whats going on with the page, and going back to make corrections if necessary.   Users/masonmurray MM

20101018 22:04:44 nbsp Hey, Brett.  Everything on the wiki is free to share.  Everybody owns it as a commonly owned product of the community.  Its cool like that.  In order to make sure of that, all contributions have to be released to Creative Commons (a legal designation meaning we all share it together).   Are you the original author of the images of pancakes and the ballot you uploaded, or did you get permission to release the photos to the Creative Commons?  If not, no worries; I found some free (as in freetouse, not free as in zero dollars) images of pancakes and a ballot box.  If you did make those images (or you got permission) and you like them better than the ones I added to the Featured Page, go ahead and change them back.  I only swapped them to try and keep the wiki content free for all to reuse and share.  Let me know either way; I changed them to try and help, not to remove your cool images.

20101025 12:18:52 nbsp Did you mean to make two Calendars?  There is a DPFS/Calendar and a Davis Peoples Free School/Calendar.  The latter is probably where it should be (under Davis Peoples Free School).  Tom moved it, but the other was restored, resulting in there currently being two different calendars, and at least one is probably not up to date. Users/JabberWokky

20101025 12:24:59 nbsp I think I just renamed it while Brett Anne was in the middle of editing it.  Ill just rerename it to get the additional changes in it. Users/TomGarberson

20101028 12:01:27 nbsp Hey Brett, I left a comment at the bottom of Next Featured Page.  As a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, we cant endorse candidates for public office.  Do you know of other local voting guides that could be added to the Featured Page in addition to the one you worked on?   I put a suggested format at the top of Next Featured Page.
