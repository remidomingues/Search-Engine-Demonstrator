Brett is a Parenting father, Bicycling Advocacy bicycle advocate, Outdoor Activities outdoor enthusiast, Running runner, Philosophy critical thinker, and former Employment employee of B&L Bike Shop.  He knows entirely too much about Paddling canoeing for someone in the bicycle industry.  He almost never talks in the third person.


Thanks for the expansion and correction... I quickly dashed that off this morning and plan on giving it a rewrite when I add links.  With regard to the note about the 4th level of hell: True, but do you really think Dante knew what he was talking about?  I mean, the man had never witnessed the horror of daytime television... the depths of the infernal realms were probably beyond his imagining.  Ive heard stories of the sixth level: Macys on Boxing Day.  Similar to the Seven Wonders of the World, perhaps the speculations on the nature of afterlife need to be updated now and then to modern settings.  wiki:gnome Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090723 20:24:35 nbsp Ah, I understand.  I havent worked on newer bikes, but the method which I described was the method for all the bikes that Ive worked on, which holds true.  I apologize if I offended you with my changes, but I did want it to be clear that if the bike seat is too high, such as to allow you to lock your knees, or fully extend your legs while normally riding (which is what I had meant, but realize I was unclear) could be hazardous.  Also with the center of gravity being higher, you are more likely to go over the front of your bike if you have to make a hard stop.  Id rather see the Freshmen be overly cautious than make silly mistakes and end up getting hurt. Users/Jteeples

20090723 23:09:02 nbsp I dont think that makes you a bad person at all.  I have been considering getting a chair and umbrella setup, grabbing a small cooler, and sitting in the middle of one of the main roundabouts (the one by the silo) and chilling there all day, on the 2nd or 3rd day of classes.  I figured it would be funny.  But Im not sure if Id be breaking any laws or not, since its technically not the road... Users/Jteeples

20090729 20:37:55 nbsp Hey, its cool to see another Debian user. Have you been to LUGOD? Its pretty fun and Ive learned a lot. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090730 08:08:00 nbsp If it makes you feel better, Ive been using nix for over 20 years, and I currently use Ubuntu (technically Kubuntu and Ubuntu Server).  There are probably better distros for digging into the OS (usually more simple ones), but for a nice working system, Ive been happy for several years.  Even as a power user/sysadmin, I can tweak system files and be comfortable that itll not break something due to strict (or just dumb) assumptions by the distro builders and packagers.

20090730 10:51:11 nbsp Those name redirects are left over from a few years back.  They are generally left alone because there are links on the web pointing to them. Users/JabberWokky

20090731 15:30:36 nbsp Hey Brett, dont forget that you have to change that info on the bike page today! Users/Jteeples

20100203 17:35:01 nbsp Dagon H.C. Jones, DDS/Staff Photos That is a much better name for the page. Users/JasonAller

20100203 18:39:43 nbsp A subpage would be great, but I dont know how to make one, can you tell me?   I would like the name of the page to reflect the fact that it is photos for both Dr. Johnson and myself, I was also planning on putting the photos of the office on there, but I think it would be even better to have a seperate page for those.  my plan is to create tabs at the top of the page much like on the Summer/fall/spring/winter in Davis pages.

20100530 16:34:13 nbsp I must admit, I would be slightly disappointed if nobody ran at that. Users/JabberWokky

20101001 17:23:06 nbsp Haha, thanks for catching my mistake on the firearms page. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101109 16:11:49 nbsp Well put. Users/JabberWokky

20101109 16:55:52 nbsp Brett dont be so lazy man. Seriously, look at apartment sites, look at the archives dude. I cant baby you man.  Users/anonpincher
