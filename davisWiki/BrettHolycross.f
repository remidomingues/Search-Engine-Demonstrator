Eventually, Ill put something meaningful here... maybe.

 Until then... 
Ive been living in the fine borough of Davis for nearly 2 years now. I attended college at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington.  Afterwords, I wandered around Europe for a few months before relocating to the flatlands known as the Central Valley. I recently conformed to the City ordinance requiring that every citizen have a bicycle.  I helps me pretend Im active and in shape.

 While Im not working in Sactown, I try to... 
  go hiking and camping
  listen to live music (the kind with real instruments, preferably)
  take photographs (see above)
  collect (and occasionally listen to) music
  feed my cat Molly (who thinks shes a human)
  cook food (and usually eat it)
  figure out why Davis has such a lame Bars Bar scene

At some point, I may attempt to elaborate on some of these.  For now, Im pretty illiterate at this whole thing, so Im going to call it good.
