Was the information on the page ever accurate? If it was, it should be preserved but noted that its no longer true. If it was never accurate, it should be corrected. We like to preserve information wherever possible as long as it true. This includes historical information. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a comment on my userpage (click the link on my name below and type something in the comments box).

I can tell you that just deleting the page without telling the community exactly why the ENTIRE PAGE is inaccurate will just result in someone putting it back as soon as they see what youve done. Please just work with us here. Users/WilliamLewis
