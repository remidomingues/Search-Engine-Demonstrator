20050219 20:33:38 nbsp I love this place! Ive brewed over a dozen batches here!. Although the atmosphere changed after it moved to Sac, it still a great place to go to make and drink great beers. They a couple dozen of their homemade beers on tap at any time. You can also have someo of them with nitrogen insteadn of crabon dioxide. Users/JamesSchwab

20050220 11:16:49 nbsp Was there last night with a group of about 15 people.  Food was good (though everyone said they thought it was a too salty, which is probably to keep the beer flowing).  Beer was good too.  Service was nice and they accomodated our large group without any problem. Users/HollywoOd
