 Davis Breweries 

   Cruess Hall  UC Davis pilot brewery.
   Sudwerk  Probably the best local brewery (and restaurant) around, specializing in German beers.

 Area Breweries 

   Berryessa Brewing Company  A mile or two west of Winters, right on Highway 128, this place has one of the best IPAs in existence.  Their IPA is frequently found on tap in Davis and elsewhere in the region; the other beers are less common.  Look for a tap handle shaped like a chain.
   Black Diamond Brewery A little gem located in Concord; the flagship Belgian Blonde Ale is unique and delicious.
   BrewItUp  A Sacramento brewery and restaurant.
   http://www.hoppy.com/ Hoppy Brewery  Folsom Blvd in Sacramento.
   Heretic Brewing Company  Airbase Parkway in Fairfield 
   http://www.jackrussellbrewing.com/ Jack Russell Brewery  Located just past Placerville on 50.
   Mount Saint Helena Mount Saint Helena Brewery  Great after a day of Hiking and Backpacking hiking or climbing.
   Pyramid Alehouse  Another Sacramento brewery and restaurant, part of a chain.  Beer not brewed on premises anymore.
    Substantially above average food and beer.  Most of the recipes use at least one of their beers in the sauces, glazes, batters, etc.  Pyramid has the best chicken wings hot wings Ive ever had.  If you havent been, its well worth the trip.  Also a great place to have a wedding reception :) Users/TomGarberson
   http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/ Rubicon Brewing Company Possibly the best craft brewery in the region.  Located in Midtown Sacramento (Capitol and 20th), they have good pub food and awesome beer.  Service can be iffy but its worth it.
   http://www.sierranevada.com/ Sierra Nevada  Located in Chico, one of the nicest (from a brewers perspective) breweries in the world. Well worth the pilgrimage.
     I was here recently for lunch. The food was submediocre but a pitcher of IPA, five (5!) twelve oz. glasses, was $7.50. Users/PaulThober prt

 Area Cideries 
For those who have not acquired the taste for beer, or want to try something different yet traditional, there is a growing presence of hard Cider in the region.  Cider is beerstrength apple alcohol.  Although fairly sweet by default, many microbrew varieties have a range from sweet to dry and champagnelike.  Cider has a history almost as long as Beer and was much more common than at present.  Johnny Appleseed planted cider apples, not Granny Smith.  UCD has a Pomology program and a Fermentation Science major, so perhaps there is a graduate student project waiting to happen studying ciders.

    http://AceCider.com Ace Cider is from Sebastopol.  They have a lovely pub and brew everything in the back.
    http://Foxbarrel.com Fox Barrel Ciders are made in Colfax, about a scenic hour up I80.  There is a tasting room in Colfax. They can be bought at the Davis Food Coop Coop.
    http://TwoRiversCider.com Two Rivers Cider is made in Sacramento.
   Ciders are available at G Street Pub, Burgers and Brew, and possibly at Sudwerk and Sophias Thai Kitchen

   http://www.sacbrew.com/ Sacramento Brewing Company  Fulton and Marconi in Sacramento and a Egyptian themed restaurant on Madison in Citrus Heights.
     Very good  excellent beer, and the menu has quite a bit of above average fare. Try the chilioil and bleu cheese fries, the pork tenderloin and the crab and shrimp ravioli.  Users/JabberWokky jw
