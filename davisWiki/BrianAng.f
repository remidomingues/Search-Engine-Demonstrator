20070129 11:35:31 nbsp Brian is possibly the most open, friendly, accessible person youll ever meet. His phone number, email, as well as all his music is available on his website for free download. He gives away free (not $!) CDs at his shows, and hell mail you one if you just email him. The world could use a lot more Brian Angs. Users/SteveDavison

20070515 06:34:34 nbsp I have piles of albums by small bands and local musicians.  Almost all I listen to a few times and never listen to again.  Brians work grows on me more each time I listen to it in the simple manner of folk music done well.  Give it a listen. Users/JabberWokky

20070810 09:44:37 nbsp It was from a volume in my collection.  I tend to read a poem or three every morning over coffee during my daily review.  I also read a bit every day of some other work and journal my thoughts (and usually fill up the margins).  Im currently going through a randomized list of Marcus Aurelius Meditations and the Everymans Library volume of Love Poems.  My wife got it for my birthday last week. Users/JabberWokky
