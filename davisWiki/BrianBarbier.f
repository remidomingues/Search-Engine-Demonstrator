Brian Barbier
I originally came to Davis in 1995 as a Native American Studies Native American Studies Major at UC Davis.  After a brief (13 year) break from my studies, I have returned to UCD as an Anthropology Major.

Most days, however, I am busy being a General Contractor, remodeling peoples homes.  I own my own business, Brian Barbier Remodeling, and my shingle has been hanging in Davis for the past 7 years. Thus, going back to school has been limited to a parttime endeavor.

My favorite hobby is Flint Knapping, the art of making tools such as arrowheads out of stone.  Hopefully this will also describe what I hope to be doing in my future career in archaeology (after a few years of Grad School, of course).

I also like volunteering for Whole Earth Festival, playing paintball, hiking, camping, and spending time with my wife and daughter.

20100905 21:46:16 nbsp Hey Brian. I was thinking it might be interesting if you would flesh out the Flint Knapping page here on the wiki and share some of your insights. I found it to be an interesting topic and am slowly beginning to learn about this functional art myself.  Users/WesP
