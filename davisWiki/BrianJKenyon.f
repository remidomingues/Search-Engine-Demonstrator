Welcome to the Wiki!

20090616 12:09:45 nbsp Heh, sorry, I thought I might remove yours as well but I thought it would be doubly rude. Users/CarrieBishop

20090618 04:10:01 nbsp Howdy! Just thought Id let you know, I reverted the paranormal activity page to its previous format, since the updates were largely cosmetic or unrelated (since chimpanzees are merely exotic, as opposed to paranormal. Users/JoePomidor

20090705 00:11:33 nbsp You really gave individual, anonymous comments some measure of credibility? Im one of the most active editors here as well as a huge apologist and I wouldnt say that some random anonymous comment on a page has much credibility. Remember that Davis Wiki is a glorified bathroom wall; anyone can write on it. It is awesome for many things, but being authoritative isnt one of them. Users/WilliamLewis

20090705 08:19:29 nbsp Davis Wiki should not have any credibility and can not have any, any more than Central Park has credibility.  Head down on a Saturday afternoon and youll find a wide spectrum of people saying different things at Central Park, and youll also find a wide spectrum of people saying different things on Davis Wiki.  People milling about, some townies, some students, some visitors, all talking... you dont really say that the ground they are standing on can have any attribute other than supporting them.  And the Wiki just supports the people who choose to use it.  Some are sane, some are clearly insane, and others are just downright strange but compelling.  Which pretty much matches the population of Davis.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20090706 17:36:57 nbsp Why did you remove the links to the press releases on Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch? Users/WilliamLewis

20090706 19:21:04 nbsp The closure, relocation, and reopening of the Library (Stephens Branch) are definite  only the exact timing is still not known. Users/DougWalter

20090706 23:26:49 nbsp just so you know, regardless of the content of the message, peoples comments really shouldnt be tampered with. Users/JoePomidor

20090707 21:22:17 nbsp We dont need to wait for hard facts to post press releases on here. Please stand back and lurk more before contributing in the future. You seem to misunderstand what kind of wiki this is. Users/WilliamLewis

20090707 22:54:22 nbsp I see the wiki as a place to organize information. If yolocounty has a web page about some davis topic, its helpful for us to link to it even if there is incomplete information. Its better than nothing and will help people find the rest of the information when it becomes available. I think more information is always helpful. Hopefully people understand the wiki is a collective work with inherently various credibility and can judge this for themself in each case. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090708 08:46:47 nbsp Please stop editing the page Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch. You have been reverted by three separate people, all three having in excess of 1000 edits on the wiki spot project. Your attempts to impose your own standards that are inconsistent with the informal standards of this community are unwelcome. Users/WilliamLewis

20090708 08:48:03 nbsp Oh, also, your continued removal of the comment is a waste of time as pretty much any regular editor will revert your deletion as soon as it is noted. Please stop wasting your time as well as this communitys time. Users/WilliamLewis

20090709 22:27:34 nbsp Dude, seriously, leave the page alone. Youre the only one who wants it that way, and everyone else is tired of reverting your edits. Users/JoePomidor

20090709 22:43:31 nbsp are you the dude who went crazy on me at the library book sale? Users/BlueDot

20090710 20:14:19 nbsp How does the wiki work? Is it important to follow certain customs to be a productive member of the Wiki Community? Is a continual battle over details on a page rather than discussion productive? Does it just give Recent Changes those watching a negative impression of the person trying to remove information? Users/JasonAller

20090711 06:04:18 nbsp Why are you removing that information? Users/JabberWokky

20090712 09:15:30 nbsp Please stop messing with Users/DougWalters post about the library closing. In my opinion it is more helpful and informative than your revision. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090712 10:54:35 nbsp Concerning the recent activity on the library page, if LillianChow were to reword her comment to not only point to the press release, but to expand on it as DougWalter does afterwards, would you then feel that it cuts down on the confusion people may feel while reading it? Is it because the same release is linked twice in successive comments (possibly implying two different press releases)? Having been following the Librarys progress I dont feel that DougWalters reply is misleadingin fact, if you want to know what the closure plans are I feel it summarizes the press release rather wellbut I was planning on integrating those comments into the main body for better exposure and dont want the same revert war occurring after I do so. Users/KevinChin

20090825 00:52:48 nbsp I work on F Street very close to 5th Street and I have seen a lot of bad traffic there driving and biking. Its a bad situation that does need to change and I think the money will be well spent. The text of that Featured Page was written collaboratively and the consensus before your edit was much different. If you have a disagreement, write it on the Talk page about the Featured Page, dont troll. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090831 07:07:34 nbsp Hey, Brian... what key points do you think are missing on the Featured Page?  Keep in mind that the blurb there is supposed to be very very short and link to the actual entry that would have expanded views. Users/JabberWokky

20090903 11:30:45 nbsp Fifth runs along the north edge of downtown. take much less stressful instead of take much more stressless perhaps? Users/JasonAller

20090904 20:43:26 nbsp Hey, so we have the bulletin board back up at The Avid Reader, however to accommodate the demand, weve moved it to the back hallway and have enlarged it. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090923 09:34:31 nbsp Hey, Brian, theres a conversation going on at Front Page/Talk about the random entry feature. Users/JabberWokky

20090927 19:48:37 nbsp I cant tell whether youre actually trying to make daviswiki better or youre just trying to get a reaction (as my wife says).  In any case, the thing that feeds daviswiki and makes it better is adding accurate content, not just moving and/or deleting stuff that you find no value in. Users/JimStewart
