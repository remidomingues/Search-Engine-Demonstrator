20130621 14:57:07 nbsp Brianany particular reason you keep changing the Front page? Users/PeteB

20130714 17:04:18 nbsp Please stop messing with the front page.  If you have issues with other editors, that is not the place to discuss them. Users/CovertProfessor

20130715 15:18:07 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  I personally thought the trolling was fairly clever.  Sorry you didnt get a bigger rise.  Maybe time to move on to bigger and better things, now? Users/TomGarberson

20130721 23:28:38 nbsp Hey Brian, can you stop editing the front page in a ridiculous fashion?  If you dont then youre very likely to be banned.  If you have problems with other editors then the right place to discuss is on one of the Wiki Community pages. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20130801 21:20:20 nbsp BrianIll be blunt. Cut the crap...your edits are now bordering on abusive. Users/PeteB

20130802 11:01:22 nbsp Hi Brian, just a heads up, there is a talk page http://daviswiki.org/Users/BrianKenyon/Talk here requesting a ban on your account.  Personally, I agree with what youre arguing for (supereditors can disrupt the DW experience).  Ive put forth a request for more discussion on improving editing styles.  Id like you to be a part of it if you are interested.  Please join the conversation on the talk page.  I would totally support getting the problem fixed.  Users/jefftolentino
