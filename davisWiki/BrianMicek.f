Re:Sword and Sandals, Why is the reference to King Arthur wrong?  I know that the logo is a sword stuck in a stone, and the stone reads greek for Arthur.  A conclusion that it has to do with the King Arthur legend seems reasonable.  Also, I can find no reference to King Agnes Crame. Users/PhilipNeustrom
