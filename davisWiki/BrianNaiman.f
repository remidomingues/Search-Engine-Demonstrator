20100503 09:01:44 nbsp Hi Brian, and welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for the warning about Zabace, Inc..  Just curious, did you ever end up getting the $180 from the security deposit refunded? Users/TomGarberson

20100728 00:08:18 nbsp @TomGarberson; Unfortunately I never got anything back from Zabace, Inc.  After everything we went through with them, I just knew that trying to get that part of our security deposit back just wasnt going to happen.  I pretty much just let it go at that. Users/BrianNaiman

20101103 16:44:49 nbsp Hey Brian, check out the links for the Ticks and SUPA on the Ultimate page.  As I noted there, the Ticks are wrapping up their weekday games, but still going on weekends.  If you dont mind entry fees and weekly commitments, SUPA has pretty good leagues and hat tournaments.  I havent played in SUPA myself, but several of the guys I normally play with have and they like it a lot (coming from pretty competitive former club players). Users/TomGarberson
