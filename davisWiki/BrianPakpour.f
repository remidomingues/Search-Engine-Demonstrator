Greetings Davis Wiki. My wife and I moved to Davis in May 2008 and this Wiki saved our lives. OK, it probably didn’t literally save our lives, but it sure felt that way. For the first year especially, when we had no clue where we needed to go for what, this Wiki came to the rescue. So, thank you for that.

My wife completed her undergraduate schooling here and is now in a http://postdocs.ucdavis.edu postdoc at UCD. That’s why we came here in 2008. I finished law school at http://law.scu.edu Santa Clara University School of Law in May 2012, and passed the July 2012 bar exam. We hope to spend the rest of our lives in Davis.  I just started a new law firm here in Davis called Pakpour Family Law.

We have a daughter who was born in 2010 at the Sutter Davis Hospital Birthing Center. I cannot say enough good things about midwifery in general, and the midwives who work specifically at the Birthing Center here in Davis. We felt so fortunate to have a resource like that only a few miles from our home.

I’m originally from Philadelphia, Pa. I attended http://www.lhup.edu Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania for undergraduate school (BA, Journalism), and then http://www.wcupa.edu West Chester University of Pennsylvania for graduate school (MA, Philosophy). I worked as a journalist covering various hightech issues for eleven years before changing careers to the law.

I spent a lot of time editing and contributing to Wiki pages when we first moved to Davis, but have since been quite busy with law school and the bar. Now that all that is over, I hope to contribute once again. Thank you to all the contributors and editors who make the Davis Wiki a reality.


20100723 18:51:48 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  I am sorry if you and I had a rocky start.  I appreciate your not wanting to get into an editing war; neither do I.  But perhaps you might wish to chime in on the discussion my revert of your edit sparked at {{{Law Students/Talk}}}.  Some people, such as myself, do feel strongly about the content and wording of the wikis pages.  I agree with you that charm and readability are not mutually exclusive.  I guess I thought it was already both charming and readable.  :)  But more important to me than the wording of this particular edit is that you not be turned away from editing the wiki; another editor has expressed this concern.  As an academic, I think its important to be able to work together through the occasional disagreement, and I hope you stick around the wiki to do just that. Users/CovertProfessor

20100723 21:56:09 nbsp Seriously though, weight in on the talk page, and welcome to the wiki

Funny how king is ranked higher than McGeorge, but McGeorge has had a higher bar passage rate... Users/StevenDaubert
 Of course, http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/testing_testing_what_exactly_does_the_bar_exam_test the bar exam is a hazing ritual that has little to do with the actual practice of law wl

 True, but bar passage rate is only one factor, and not even the most important one, when it comes to U.S. News and World Report. Its typically undergrad GPA and LSAT score that rule both the rankings and whether you get into a particular law school. BP

20100729 12:01:49 nbsp Its worth plenty, the more voices the better.  Some people get heated about certain issues thatve been boiling for a long time now, but everyones got an equal voice, subject to the establishment of a little bit of identity.  Some of us are leery about the idea of requiring identity (of whatever sort) as a threshold to having a voice here, but regardless, youre easily past that point. Users/TomGarberson

20100729 13:48:47 nbsp Brian, if you have a few minutes to spare, would you mind dropping in and giving your input over at Wiki Community/Cant We All Just Get Along?  As a newer user who caught some backlash from the tension thats been floating around here, your opinion would be very valuable. Users/TomGarberson

20100729 14:58:43 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Community/Can%27t_We_All_Just_Get_Along?actiondiff&version22&version11 I didnt think youd be the person to break first.  Should I reply and point out that it isnt me who is obsessed with identity?  Would that be constructive for the page? Would it be constructive if we started arguing  now  about whether your edit improved readability?  Users/CovertProfessor
  Im sorry if it seemed I was trying to blame you. I dont think anyone in particular is to blame. My only point is that the tone of changes, edits, reverts, etc., is getting out of hand. Just the tone of your response recalls the combative nature of this wiki. Big Bad Editor v. N00b. When socalled n00b objects, enter other big bad editors to back up BBE. Then things digress from there until we have a page, created to discuss a page. For the sake of argument, lets say your reversion of my changes were 100% awesome. Someone like me in your position might say Hey ... new guy here ... edits not totally worthless ... perhaps Ill let it fly for now and send him a message asking if he took into account the whimsical nature of the page before I go and revert it back hoping the door doesnt hit him on the way out ...  ... But thats ME, which is why I was taken aback by it. Users/BrianPakpour
   Hey, thats my apology at the top of this page, and an attempt to restart the relationship.  I agree that I didnt handle your edit as well as I might have.  Its also interesting for me to hear your perspective, because it seems to me that the BBEs are disagreeing amongst each other with far more heat.  Not that thats a good thing.  But it means that everyone is on edge and thus not as patient as they should be with new people.  That doesnt excuse my behavior, but perhaps it helps explain it a bit.  And, I might add, it explains the talk page that was created for your edit.  That had more to do with DS (who has been furious at me for some time) and me than it did with you. Sorry you got caught in the middle. Users/CovertProfessor
    The fact of the matter is that you all have a right to take exception to many of the edits here. There are so many immature individuals just flaming pages, deleting comments, and starting new user accounts just to do it all over again. But I think you, better than others, understand that not every new editor does those things. Im sorry if it seemed I was blaming you. I appreciate the apology and well try to start our relationship anew. I plan to update my page, but I just havent decided what to add. BP
     Its a deal.  Im all for clean slates.  :)  cp
      Thats because youre a professor and have students to clean your chalk board.  Bourgeois!  Off with his/her head!  (Sorry, I just played http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillotine_(game) Guillotine last night). tg
       Students to clean off my chalkboard!!  Ha!  What century are you in?!  amused  cp
        I thought thats what TAs are for. BP
         Thats been known to happen every now and then.  Im always a bit surprised when it does.  cp

20100801 08:35:22 nbsp Why is it so inappropriate? Maybe there is more to it than would appear, especially if it is the sort of bike that is more noticed by people who care about those bike shops particularly. I assumed this was the reason why it was posted on those 2 pages. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 I dont know that its inappropriate per se, but if everyone did it, the bike shop pages would get awfully long.  The Bike Recovery System page is a good place for that stuff. Users/TomGarberson
  Well sure, but I dont expect most people to do it anyway because the Bike Recovery System is a more obvious place. I dont think its a problem for these things to occaisionally be posted in other reasonable places too. It can always be removed later once its really irrelevant. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 I think I was kind of thinking along Toms general line of thought. If everyone immediately tags pages associated with an object they lost whenever they lost it (think: all the pages having to do with pets), it could get messy, and unnecessarily so, since we already have the Bike Recovery System. Again, I feel for someone whos lost his bike (or pet for that matter), but Im not sure posting to various pages throughout the Wiki to recover it is the appropriate method to do so. He also already posted about it a http://daviswiki.org/APEX_Cycles_%26_Service?actiondiff&version2143&version1142 few months ago.  BP

20100802 14:36:23 nbsp Im not the one who originally added it, but yes.  Users/WilliamLewis

20130306 12:48:58 nbsp Congrats on admission and on getting the firm up and running.  Best of luck with it! Users/TomGarberson
 Thanks Tom! I appreciate the well wishes! Users/BrianPakpour

20130306 21:23:09 nbsp Best of luck with the new business.  May your practice flourish for many years to come! Users/JabberWokky
 Thanks JW!!! I appreciate it, both the comment, and the sentiment it engenders! Users/BrianPakpour

20130306 21:24:30 nbsp Sure!  Glad to be able to offer a hand.  Good luck! Users/CovertProfessor

20130425 00:59:59 nbsp I like the Wunderbar and all, but their beer selection is substantially smaller than a number of other watering holes around town. Users/MikeyCrews

20130425 01:12:44 nbsp What part of Philly where you from? Users/StevenDaubert

 I actually grew up in the burbs outside the city, mainly Bucks County, and more specifically Holland. I moved into Center City as an adult and lived in West Philly with my then girlfriend, until we moved here to Davis and got hitched. Users/BrianPakpour
