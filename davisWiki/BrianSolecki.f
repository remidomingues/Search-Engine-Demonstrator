Winner of the 2005 Predict The Measure X Vote contest on the Wiki.


Brian and the Fam... My moment of glory was the week of November 916, when I spent the week as the King of the Wiki. Now we are back to being regular peasants..ho hum.
I spent the last 9 as a youth pastor at University Covenant Church.  In July 2006, Brian and the family moved to Chico.  Nice knowing you! perhaps i need to start a wiki:chico chicowiki...

        20051109 15:27:14 nbsp I held him personally responsible for the entire Mace Ranch Elementary debacle... He handled the entire situation poorly, and most Mace Ranch residents would have been much more willing to accept the school not opening had he been even slightly respectful toward their viewpoints. Other board members disagreed with opening the school, but at least appeared to thoughtfully listen... Users/BrianSolecki
