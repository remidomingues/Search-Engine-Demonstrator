20081009 21:47:21 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Im reverting your changes to Theta Xi, but Ill try to remake some of your edits. The reason for the revert is that you wiped the page of all of its links and inserted the dividers made of ΘΞ characters. Ill also add a redirect from ΘΞ to Theta Xi. Users/JasonAller

20081015 01:02:08 nbsp Rather than http://daviswiki.org/Theta_Xi?actiondiff&version259&version158 deleting, how about discussing? Youve removed some comments that other people left, there are better ways of handling the situation than getting into a revert war over those comments. Feel free to create the {{{Theta Xi/Talk}}} page and explain why you think that the historical comments should be removed, or archived, or whatever it is that you want to do. The Wiki Community will see that page and engage you in discussion about it. You might get your way, you might not, but it will be more productive than reverting it back and forth. Users/JasonAller

20081015 10:22:56 nbsp Hi Brian, I added back in the comments to the Theta Xi page. I know how frustrating it is when your organization isnt presented in the best of light but I agree with JasonAller that you should talk to the community about it via a {{{Theta Xi/Talk Talk page}}} instead of just deleting over and over. That way other people can hear your point of view as to why those comments shouldnt be included, and perhaps youll hear from others as to why they were added in the first place. And the wiki community will think more highly of Theta Xi for engaging in communication.  Users/ElleWeber
