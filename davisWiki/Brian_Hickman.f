This is Brian Hickman. He is from Berkeley, an Exercise Biology EXB major, who lives at the Alphabet House.

Brian enjoys skiing, playing Videogaming video games, watching movies, and being competitive. By being competitive, I mean he enjoys winning.

I would not do Brian, but I am a guy, and he is a guy, and neither of us are homosexual, so my opinion does not hold much weight. Brian IS fun to hang out with, and has a sardonic and dry sense of humor. He is also good at not being boring.
