Image(face.jpg, left, thumbnail) When it rainswhen it really really rainsI think of my father and the ways he would try to entertain his bored little girl looking gloomily out the window, a girl who was hoping the sun for a moment, for just one moment, would come out and say hi. I never liked TV much back then; I just couldnt sit still for that long. Too restless, I guess. I read a lot, but reading was only fun when it was on my terms and not born out of the attrition of boredom and bad weather.

My father told stories, and I lived for them. He had so many stories, so so many stories. Stories about everything and stores about nothing. Funny ones. Sad ones. Weird ones. But my favorites, my absolute favorites, were the ones where hed explain the way things worked. The hows and the whys. He had an answer to almost everything, and it was my gamemy challengeto try and ask him something he did not know. And when he did not have the answer, hed say these words and these words got me so excited: Lets look it up. And we did. So many times I stood before those bookshelves, hands on my hips, face scrunched up trying to figure out which volume to search. I remember the smell of those books, that musky smell of leather and parchment. I remember the pages, crisp and toilettank white, the way they crinkled beneath my fingers when I flipped them. But most of all I remember the lessons I learned on those days, the lessons that went beyond the answers to my questions. First: Youll never know everything, and thats why life is fun. If my Dad taught me anything, it was that lack of curiosity leads to lack of knowledge. Second: If you dont know, look it up. Because knowing is better than not knowing. Third: (and this is a direct quote from my father) If it doesnt have the answer, we need to get a new encyclopedia.

As a kid, it was so easy looking stuff up in the encyclopedia. You had one source and it was definitive. Its more complicated these days with Google and Wikipedia. There is so much information and disinformation. So many lenses to peer through. So much content to filter and distill. There are no simple answers to complex questions. And that, my friends, is the tragedy of adulthood.

I like the idea of the Wiki. I like it because it exists in a normative world, a romantic world. We are all its editors and contributors and we hold each other accountable. It is the world of an optimist.

I dont think the Wiki works all the time. But I think it, like any kind of information, can be a useful tool. It just depends on the way youre using it: how, why, and for what.

Dad, I know, wouldve loved it.
