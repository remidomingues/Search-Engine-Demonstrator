Brianna is a senior Communications and Organizational Studies double major, minoring in English. She lives in the Alpha Phi house at 327 Russell Blvd, and is the current President of the chapter as well as webmaster for the website http://www.ucdalphaphi.com.  She also founded Alpha Phis new philanthropy event King of Hearts two years ago which raised over $3,300 to support cardiac care. Alpha Phi and the greater Greek community have played a huge role in her life. She was a member of Greek Conduct Board her freshman year, is a current member of the Greek honor society Order of Omega, and was voted Most Outstanding Member by her chapter for 2005.

Brianna has a lot of Southern California pride as she was born and raised in San Diego. She has worked as a tour guide and exhibit narrator at Sea World for 4 summers, and loves the beach.

Brianna has also been highly involved on campus. In 2005, Brianna gave up going home to San Diego for the summer so she could eat at the new DC, live in the dorms, and share her enthusiasm for UCD with incoming freshman and parents during the Summer Advising program. She also completed her yearlong term as a member of the ASUCD Senate in fall 2005, and served as the Media Board and Internet Networking Committee representative during her term.

This past summer, Brianna studied abroad through the UC Davis Summer Abroad program in Greece. Next winter she will be participating in the UC Washington Program in D.C.

In addition to being heavily involved in her sorority and ASUCD, she also works as an intern for the new Greek Advisor on the 4th floor of the MU, and volunteers for Blood Source as one of the ASUCD Blood Drive Student Directors. The next blood drive will be in November!

Briannas favorite time of the year is spring quarter and is excited about going to the rec pool and working on her tan!!
