Who are we:
Bridges International at UC Davis is a student organization which seeks to help international students through service activities, social networking, and spiritual resources.

What do we do:
We like to help students in any way we can.  Some of the things that we have helped students with in the past include opening banking accounts, buying bicycles, and grocery shopping.
In the beginning of the school year, we hold new student welcome pizza parties and many students have become friends at our welcome events.  Another event among the studentsâ€™ favorites is American Culture Day, where we explore these topics: American slangs and idioms, American holiday celebration, and cultural differences.  Over the course of the school year, we are planning to hold many fun events that include hiking trip, Stanford tour, and iceskating.  We are also planning to invite special guest speakers to help those who are exploring different career paths.  Please go to our website bridgesucd.com for further details!
