Address(Briggs Hall, 38.540147189739, 121.756253135253)  was built in 1971 to accomodate a steep increase in students and faculty in the biological sciences division. This massive, concrete building is is a nice example of brutalism. This modernistic archtectural style is characterized by the use of naked concrete and is inspired by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unité_d’Habitation Unité d’Habitation by Le Corbusier. Another feature is the exposure of the building’s functions. In Briggs Hall the stairways are for example located outside the building as eminant at the main entrance. In the ‘60s many North American campuses expanded and erected brutalistic buildings, in California even leading to the California Brutalist Style.

Briggs Hall was named in honour of http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/plantbreeding/main/major_figures.htm#fred Fred N Briggs, a pioneer in the application of genetics to crop improvement.

Briggs houses biological research groups, including researchers in the College of Biological Sciences, Molecular Biology graduate group, Ecology, Microbiology, Entomology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biochemistry. The more recent Life Sciences Building is structurally connected to Briggs Hall.

The main office for Molecular and Cellular Biology is located on the first floor, just past the main entrance (walk in, see the left hallway, stop at the first office). Biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology majors should go there for advising, paperwork, and information about the MCB club. Main offices for Microbiology and Entomology are located on the third floor.

The area around and just outside of Briggs Hall may or may not be haunted.  Or at least was over a decade ago.
