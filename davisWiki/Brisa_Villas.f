  /Pre 2011  Reviews before the October 2009 management change

20090205 00:44:55 nbsp I have lived at Brisas for quite a while, and i must say the complaints below are exaggerated, the houses are beautiful and cheap, management is awesome theyll help you out with almost anything you need. I also hear that this guy named Peter is gonna live in Brisas and hes the sexiest man alive. Users/championsleague

20090630 20:47:01 nbsp I enjoy living here, its peaceful and quiet. I just wished we had some sort of study lounge with a giant white board and desks, because I feel like other apartment complexes have amenities like that with a pool table, etc.  Users/MissAmyQ

20100406 17:41:39 nbsp The house and location themselves are very nice and quiet. Right accross the bus stop and a large park. But as for amenities there is virtually none. Im saying this because even with the pool and small gym, I dont see how they expect itd be suffient for use by three complexes. (well nevermind the gym; its so under equiped that no one really goes there.)

Other than that, Im kinda iffy on the management. And its not because of the prompt and timely maintenance services (which is a plus), but because even after more than half the year, they still cannot get my name right (and my name is a common american name.) I corrected them over ten times and instead of erasing the mistakes, they just tacked on another different name to every notice they give out. So as far as I know, they still think Im one of five imaginary people.  Users/kiddmit3


20100508 14:00:47 nbsp Have lived at brisa for 3 years now and overall its been a pretty good experience, I definitely recommend.  Special shout out to Baker at the management office, he has been the best at helping us with any issues/problems weve had, including finding us a roommate. Users/youngkells

20100508 14:47:53 nbsp i have lived at brisa for two years and i have nothing but positive things to say about the management during my time here. I would like to extend a special thanks to Baker in the management office as he has been especially helpful and professional and always makes sure if we have a problem in our apartment it is promptly taken care of.   Users/ukes425

20100628 12:32:01 nbsp Ill be living in brisa next year and Im trying to plan out my furniture. does anyone know where to find the measurements of each room? or at least a more detailed floorplan?  Users/skepticisms

          Glad you choose Brisa. Floor plans are available on our website at http://www.brisadavis.com/floorplans/. If you need any dimensions not listed on the
          floor plan call me, Baker, at 5307582662. Also, if you are in town and it would help to look inside a house let me know.

20100918 23:40:18 nbsp Okay, let me just say that Im glad to have finally moved out from this place.

Just recently did I receive my $8 security deposit back. Thats right, eight dollars. But hold up, its not even mine because again, management cant get my name right (even though I already corrected their mistake for the 18th time!)

From my experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Brisa to anyone who wants decent management. They are very unprofessional. They dont care about any problems related to your living situations (i.e dirty housemates, broken doors, and even rats.) All they care about is whether or not you have cash to milk dry.

Even though they are not legally bounded to help in house affairs, management should take a proactive role especially when they are informed of housemates who cause reckless damage such as punching holes in walls and breaking doors. You may think that Brisa would be concerned with such violent behavior, but upon notice, Brisa only asked if we had the money to pay for damages. Apparently, the manager, herself, understands this to be normal college student behavior. Oh, and two or three rats are no big deal either.

Dont get sucked in by the model home or location, it may appear great but the poor management is not worth the hefty rent nor the long weeks with a broken door.

Also, just a heads ups, if you already signed the lease, take pictures! Management may unnecessarily repaint your whole apartment/townhouse for $600.

          First, we were very concerned about the roommate problems your household was having over the year as well as about the damage to property. I regret that in spite of our efforts and the discussions and meeting we had with your household, it was not possible to resolve the roommate issues. We are not professional mediators or counselors, we are property managers, and when our efforts at resolution were not productive, we provided you with referrals to professional outside mediation.

          I am glad you liked the location and the apartment model and I regret we were not able to be of more assistance to you.


          Steven Baker
          Community Manager

                   Baker, although I appreciate your apology, I do not believe you are one to apologize in this matter. The head manager whom I had our meeting with was not only adverse, but also counterproductive. Given the state of our household, I intended our meeting to address our security deposit. She specifically pointed out that I had no reason to be concerned about the situation because the household neglect was completely normal with college students. With that and more, she basically enabled my housemates to cease discussion of any sort of cleaning.

                   Regardless, whats done is done. I received poor management service, $0 security deposit, and a load of rat droppings. I just want to inform future tenants that unless management changes up, theyre going to be very disappointed.

                   side note: And Baker, while I was still in Brisa, you apologized about getting my name wrong countless times. The last time I saw you, you even reassured me that my name would finally be corrected in the system. Then I got the check. Comon man...

I love Brisa!

Its a house on a street with a yard. Now, I admit, Brisas rent is quite high, but its totally worth it. Its spacious and you have a front yard and backyardwhich is so nice. My unit has been remodeled so we have new carpet and cabinets which makes it that much better.

The management & maintenance has been fantastic as well. I moved in a week earlier than 9/1/10 and so they prorated the extra amount Id have to pay. At the beginning of October, they gave me back that money because it had taken them quite some time to get a washer/dryer unit into our place (way past 9/1/10) and new window screens. Every time we have sent in a maintenance request we usually get someone to fix it the same day or the next day. I sent in a request for a bigger fridge because the one that was in our house was older and smaller and our groceries would be so overstuffed. Guess what? The next day, they deliver us a brand spankin new fridge.

SeriouslyBrisa Villas has always made me feel like I was a VALUED tenant. WHO THE HELL EVER FEELS THAT WAY? No one. Management companies are usually so evil and maintenance repairs? Forget about it. I have friends that still arent getting any heat in this 35 degree Davis weather.

Prior to moving into Brisa Villas, I read a lot of complaints about spiders and bugs. And I hate to admit it, but there is a spider problem. It doesnt bother me too much, because they usually crawl up to the corner of the high ceiling and just eat the bad insects that occasionally fly into the house. But they really arent that big of a problem.

I strongly feel that Brisa Villas values their tenants happiness and satisfaction. Also, my housemates and I were talking about it..and we concluded that we love Baker! Hes always so understanding when we call in with maintenance request and other questions. I think the landlord needs to pay him more because he is a huge asset to keeping tenants happy at Brisa Villas.

20120125 13:38:40 nbsp ive been living here for almost 3 years now and couldnt find any reason to move away. the management is the best and maintenance guys are fast and very reliant. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. btw the head man, Baker, hes cool. knowing you by first name basis, saying whats up in safeway. you dont get that with any other management places. hghly recommend. Users/RyanD

20120917 16:37:35 nbsp What ever happened to Baker? He was such a sweet and friendly guy. These days when I call the leasing office, someone named Melissa always answers the phone as though Im wasting her time.   Users/Lilly

 Lilly, Im sorry to hear that your calls to the office seemed to have felt rushed. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to give me a call or send me an email at sorrentoapartments@gmail.com. Thomas, Community Manager

20130825 10:49:01 nbsp I personally love it here and Ive never had problems with management. They have been patient with me and helped me quickly and efficiently. Like when I needed a new key, I called the day before to ask about how much it was for a new one and when I went into the office, they already made it. And whenever I needed something repaired, the repair team would come seriously a few hours after I send in the request via phone. I love Brisa and aside from the occasional spider here and there, its an awesome place to live and the people at the office are the best when it comes to customer service and helpfulness. They always have fresh cookies and coffee too! :) Users/JackieG



20140114 22:20:15 nbsp I think that Brisa has been nice the past two years I have lived here. I originally chose Brisa because of its location: closeness to Safeway and frequently running buses to campus. Soon afterward however, I have seen other good traits of Brisa. For the house itself, I think it is reasonably priced for the space that is rented out. The parking is also great, each unit has like 3 parking spaces, and plenty of parking in the front. But what I think makes Brisa a great place to live is the management. The management has excellent staff who really care about their clients. Thomas is a great manager, he is very quick, efficient, approachable, and professional. In addition other members like Elena, Jenna, Jeff, etc have all been pleasant in encounters and are quick to resolve problems. Even on finals week they provide residents with snacks and scantrons  aside from their cookies, coffee, and popcorn everyday in the office. Although the maintenance crew is limited in number, they have been able to complete a service request the same day I give it to the office. Under the same management, there are also Sorrento apartments and Avalon houses which seem to be great units. Overall, I feel like this management has a lot to offer: great units, great location, and great staff. Users/ElizabethDietz
