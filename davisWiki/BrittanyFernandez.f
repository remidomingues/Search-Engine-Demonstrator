20101013 22:10:21 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  People will have an easier time taking your concerns about your former living situation seriously if you respond to their concerns rather than deleting them.  Your comment came a bit out of nowhere  there was no page for this place before  and your comments sound pretty harsh, almost libelous.  Everything you say could be completely true, but it is hard for other editors to judge that.  One thing that might help, besides responding to the concerns, is to establish some identity on the wiki.

20101013 22:16:00 nbsp Sounds like the sort of thing you need to take to small claims court.  And maybe the Davis police department. Users/TomGarberson

20101013 22:57:39 nbsp Since you deleted my comment, I will be more blunt.  You need to communicate with other wiki editors, or I can foresee that the pages youve made will just be deleted, and your efforts will come to nothing.  Deleting wont help. Users/CovertProfessor

20101013 23:12:04 nbsp Interesting.  Am I right in inferring from your deletion of those pages that contacting Reeda Palmer convinced you libel was a bad idea? Users/TomGarberson
