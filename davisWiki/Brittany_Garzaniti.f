 Candidate Statement 

Hey y’all beautiful Aggies!

I’m Brittany Garzaniti, a 2nd year Political Science: Public Service and Community and Regional Development Major with a Minor in Social and Ethnic Relations. I am running on the S.M.A.R.T. slate (Students Matter: Activism, Retention, and Teamwork) which seeks to give a voice in ASUCD to all UC Davis students. I have the amazing opportunity to work at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Resource Center on campus, as well as a coproducer for the Women’s Resources and Research Center’s production of VAGINA: OurStories. Being connected to multiple communities through various student run events is what motivates me as a person and will continue to drive me as your ASUCD senator. In working with other resource centers on campus, I have been able to collaborate with not only the WRRC, but the Cross Cultural Center, Student Recruitment and Retention Center, Health Education Program, CAPS, the Community Advising Network, and clubs on campus such as Asian Pacific Islander Queers (APIQ). My experiences make me a well rounded candidate, but my voice and strong sense of self is what puts me ahead of all the other candidates.

CREATE A HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTER FOR STUDENTS
It is about time that we have an alternative option to CAPS and the Student Health and Wellness Center. I’d like to start a student initiated and operated holistic health center for students. This center would provide access to resources such as natural remedies, medicinal marijuana, and meditation spaces. Not only would this be a valuable addition to UC Davis, but it directly reflects a need of the community to have an accessible alternative health system that reflects their needs.

CREATE A RATING SYSTEM FOR THE UCD ADMINISTRATION
Our Principles of Community states, We will strive to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring. In order to build a true community here at UC Davis, I want to establish open communication between administrators and students by implementing a system to reflect the sentiments of students toward the administration. The fresh approach I’d like to take is to establish an approval rating systems for the various members of the Administration and ASUCD units. Students will be able to give direct feedback to Senate and the Administration. Changes on campus take the collaboration of not only students, but administrators and staff/faculty members and we need their support to kick out issues such as tuition hikes, to create more classes, and to improve the quality in each college student.

Vote for informed student leaders that genuinely care about your undergraduate experience and will listen to YOUR needs. VOTE FOR ME BRITTANY GARZANITI #1 for ASUCD Senate, S.M.A.R.T #25, and F.U.Q. for Exec!
