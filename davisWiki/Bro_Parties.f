Bro parties are parties (not always Frat Parties) where the atmosphere is Shadiness Factor shady, ghetto music is pumping, and most people are there for the free beer and drunk chicks.  You just go for the free booze, really  and thats perfectly okay.  These just arent really places you can meet quality people.  Theyre good for getting drunk off Natural Ice Natty Ice and freaking with some skanky girl.  Bro parties are synonymous with the words slutfest or brofest and often lead to precarious nights and awful hangovers.

As opposed to a hipster or scenester party, the perceived likelihood of date rape or bro rape is much higher at a bro party.

Incident two:  I am peeing in the back yard of a St. Patties brofest extravaganza, when two guys walk in to the back.  Their conversation goes like this:
   Hey, Im gonna pee over here.  You go pee over there.
   No homo, right?
   Yeah, no homo.

It is for experiences like these that I chose to brave the halls of frat houses and keg lines.  Truly, such events are proof of mans splendor. Users/CodyDuncan
