Broken Society used to play a lot in Davis and all around the area.  They were instrumental in making Cafe Colonial, next to the Colonial Theater in Sacramento, an all ages venue for punk bands to play at while it lasted.  The great thing about Broken Society is that it has smart political/social songs plus Gregg and Aaron have always been active in making things happen.
