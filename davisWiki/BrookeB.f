Brooke B is originally from wiki:sacramento:Front Page Sacramento, CA.  She graduated from UC Davis with a major in Genetics and a minor in Evolution and Ecology in June 2011.  She worked as a UC Davis Tours campus tour guide from her sophomore to senior year. As of May 09, she also worked as an assistant for the Begun Drosophila (fruit fly) lab, and later for the Langley Drosophila lab, but on her resume it states Lord of the Flies.

She loves to cook, especially when feeding friends.  She probably makes some of the best mashed potatoes known to man. In fact, she is often quoted to be so Irish, she even dips her french fries in mashed potatoes. In her spare time, she watches movies and reruns of Dexter, Weeds, and The Office (US), Its Always Sunny, CSI, Greys, Bones, The X files, and Family Guy online.  Her favorite websites are http://failblog.org/ FailBlog, http://www.textsfromlastnight.com/ TFLN and http://www.explosm.net/ This Online Comic.  Some day she will score a bag of crap from http://www.woot.com/ Woot!  Brooke likes to collect funky oneofakind earrings and would some day like to learn to belly dance really well (shes got the hip scarf, now all she needs is the rhythm).

Brooke spends her free time searching for clues left behind by the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion CCCC.  Over the two years she has spent in Davis, she has come to love Bizarro Davis all the weirdness it has to offer. She hopes to one day live here yearround, even though she prefers walking to Bicycles biking  any day. (Although, maybe if her bikes werent always breaking she would feel differently).
