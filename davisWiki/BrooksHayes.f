About me: I have lived in the Peoples Republic for most of the last 12 years.  My first time around I studied wine making but now I am a grad student in Cell and Developmental Biology.  After I graduate I might just have to go back to making wine, at this point I am thinking that was much more fun.  Wine also goes handinhand with the food blog that I share with Users/KristenMartin Kristen Martin, a fellow Davishead.  Check it out.

Personality:  Rather than describe myself I think one might get a better idea of my personality by reading my occasionally posted blogs.  It is a window into my brain if you read between the lines
