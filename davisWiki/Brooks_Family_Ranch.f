20070816 14:31:50 nbsp Depending on what your needs are Brooks maybe right for you, it wasnt right for me. There is only one arena it is half covered. The lesson and training program did not exist while I was there. It is one of the few places you can pasture board your horse; however, the pastures are dry and they are rather small. My horse could not handle being in a small pasture with other horses and caused some injury to himself and others. Cisco is great very helpful and caring.  Users/Donna
