Bros is plural form of Bro and can refer to a group of Bros or just the idea of Bros in general. The Bro can be best characterized as the wannabe jock or wannabe fratboy, although many fratboys and jocks can fall into the Bro category. Bro, which can also be pronounced Brah or Braw is often used as a term of endearment amongst other Bros. A good place to go bro watching is the ARC. The Davis Players Society is a nonFraternity Fraternal social group whos members might be Bros.

Sidenotes: A brah myself, I disapprove of the indiscriminate use of the term. Brahs are not necessarily associated with frats or idiocy, but can refer to those who resist selling out by keeping it real and having a good time regardless of social status or popularity. 40s are encouraged though.

I am pretty sure I am not a Bro, however I have been refered to as Brah by people who I believe to be die hard members of this division of the social structure.  So either I am Bro, which I am not, or Bros refer to nonBros as Brah on occasion.  I am not sure what is going on.  Users/GeorgeLewis
   I can asssure you that Brah has no connection to some die hard members of this division of the social structure.  In fact being a Brah means you are no member of any structure.  It means you are yourself; an individual.   Users/RobertBaron

You have forgotten the term Broham.  A term of endearment between men to reaffirm heterosexuality, or a really cool fool, or a chill ass mofo. Users/JakeLippman
  ooh, good one for the glossary

 I have lived and been a world class drunk in Davis for the past five years. I have partied with a variety of fraternities, and have regularly attended Sogas, and have never ever heard anybody supposed bro referring to himself or his friends as bros, except in certain ironic occurences. I think that this is an example of stereotypical pop cultural references appearing to be a reality by people who havent arent necessarily aware of so called bros... that being said I dont support them that much, unless they give me booze, then Id support that shit. Trust me, someone on a website once nominated me as a Party King Of Davis Party King.  Users/JoshuaHeller

The Bro Lexicon:

  Sup bro?
  You wanna a beer bro?
  Dude

Bros can be found wandering Frat Row and at many parties in Davis.  They also have Bro Parties.

I dont know if Davis has a big steroid using community or what, so I dont know how relevant it is...but if theyre in the gym working out for hours, theyre either on steroids or overtraining.

20091003 03:31:09 nbsp Use of the term bro can be indicative of casual atmosphere. Bro is ideally used among friends when theyre drunk, buzzed, high or otherwise intoxicated.  The perpetually stoned character, Stoney (Pauly Shore) , in the film “Encino Man,” states, “The truth is bro, lifes about greasing the do back, buddy, and wheezin on the bufffest, man.”  “Bro” is also related to alternative sports, often associated with drug use; think surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding.  The other day I saw two girls longboarding on campus; one girl said to the other, slow it down bro! Within the geography of language, use of “bro” insinuates its users are on the west coast or wannabe on the west coast.  Think of Dutch Bros. Coffee, pronounced “broze,” not brothers.  Users/Nan
