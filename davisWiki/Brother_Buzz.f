Brother Buzz was a Music Scene Davis band in the early to mid 1970s, comprised of four U.C. Davis students and a local Davis resident.  The members included Jerry Hobrecht (lead singer and harmonica), Andy Lagomarsino (bass guitar), Eric Larson (rhythm guitar), Jim Jolly Holland (drums), and Steve Stive Cooper (lead guitar). The band played at local clubs, schools, parties, and wedding receptions.

Bass player, Andy, went on to play with local bands, such as Steel Breeze, Shenandoah, Landis, and, in the 1980s, the Surfaris (best known for 60s hits Wipe Out and Surfer Joe).  Andy currently resides in Kelsey, California, tending to his vineyard.  Lead singer, Jerry, is currently the City Attorney of Vacaville and lives in Davis.  Guitarist, Eric, is currently a counselor and instructor at Skyline College in San Bruno, California.
