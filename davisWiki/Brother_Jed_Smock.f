20100724 22:38:58 nbsp One day I was talking with Brother Jed on the Quad when a rather rude young fellow sprinted by and grabbed Jeds Bible right out of his hands. While I may disagree with what is written in said book, I still strongly feel that theft is unjust, so I followed. The thief ran fast, but I walked far and byandby caught up with him, whereupon I used the chaos powers vested in me as a Judicator of the Ancient Order of Walkers to bend his mind in the other direction. After about half an hour of this spellcasting, his feeble mind snapped and he ran away as fast as he could. I walked back to the Quad, and by the time I got there Jed had his Bible againapparently the thief had sprinted past and given it back again. It seems my magic had worked.

In any event, Jed seems like an okay guy. His beliefs are insane (he believes in hell and god and stuff like that) but if you can have a quiet conversation with him away from angry crowds in the Quad he can actually be quite calm and reasonable and interesting to talk to. He also gave me a copy of his book, _Who_Will_Rise_Up_, which seems to be a mixture of some insane beliefs and some quite sound strategies for public speaking and crowd manipulation.

20110227 15:47:22 nbsp How is it that people like this are able to preach on campus? i realize it is a public institution, but you cant do this shit in a public library, or at a public pool, or in a public town hall meeting, so why the hell are people allowed to do this on campus? There has to be a way to stop people from doing it, because it creates a negative learning environment and makes the students who are paying the private school fees feel unsafe on their own campus!

Just because you happen to disagree doesnt mean it should be banned. Also, if you actually feel threatened by an old man holding a sign and jabbering on about hellfire and brimstone youve got some larger issues. If you disagree with him and want to do something about it A: debate him (calmly works best) or B: do like the two gentlemen behind him in the above did and conduct your own counter demonstration. He has as much right to be there as anyone else. Simple as that.  Users/ARWENNHOLD
