Out of curiosity, why did you http://daviswiki.org/Hiking_and_Backpacking?actiondiff&version2104&version1103 remove the Berryessa Trails link?  Also, youve done some pretty darn incredible work on that entry! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100323 22:41:30 nbsp Berryessa Trails link is on the Napa Wiki hiking page where it belongs. Users/BruceThomas

20100518 11:26:51 nbsp Hey, I highly recommend creating DavisKayakers as an entry (just click on the dotted to do link to create it).  It sounds like a neat group. Users/JabberWokky

20100809 14:44:05 nbsp Hi Bruce!  Ive been meaning to say hi for awhile.  I always see your great edits to the Hiking and Backpacking pages, and I really appreciate them!  I noticed you linked to an external page for dog parks.  Did you know the wiki had a page for that (Dog Parks)?

Also, if you ever had some time and wanted to add some detail  like, which are your favorite hikes and why  I for one would appreciate it, and I bet others would, too. Users/CovertProfessor

20100820 06:54:25 nbsp Bruce, I was trying to gently and subtly encourage you to use more internal links and content in your wiki editing.  External links are ok, but they arent what a wiki is really about, which is building info on Davis and surrounding areas in a readily accessible way.  For example, when I first moved here I had a very hard time even figuring out that Cold Canyon was the closest hike, and I had trouble figuring out how to get to it.  There were so many links it was overwhelming.  I did try to fix that on the appropriate page  I dont know if I succeeded.  Anyway, I tried to say this gently because I really do appreciate all the hard work youve put in and was hoping to nudge you in a slightly different direction.  I hear you about not being able to get out there hiking nearly often enough! Users/CovertProfessor

20101011 12:53:30 nbsp The admin (the person or people who set up the wiki) have blocked people from being able to edit that page.  Each wiki community grows in different directions.  Some only allow registered editors who pass an application process to edit.  Others allow anybody to edit, not even requiring that they have an account (which tends, unfortunately, to attract a ton of spam).  Youll have to find the admin of the wiki and request access.  If you have problems finding the admin, let me know, and Ill track her or him down. Users/JabberWokky

20130216 13:14:07 nbsp Thanks for your great additions to the Fremont Weir page (and all of your great additions).  Does one have to worry about being shot at during hunting season?  Do you only go during the offhunting months?  Users/CovertProfessor
