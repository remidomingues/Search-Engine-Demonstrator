20060524 10:57:08 nbsp Dr. Thomas is very professional, friendly and he knows what hes doing.  His office also seems to have very stateoftheart technology, of all the dentists Ive been to in Davis Ive had my best experience with this one. Users/HaggroAlex

20061229 00:10:49 nbsp Theyre going to refuse service to you if you dont provide them with your SSN to bill to insurance companies. They dont care if you give them your dental insurance member id number, they still want your SSN. Users/JohnWong

20070406 01:05:52 nbsp I have been to this dentist several times for treatment, and theyve been very good, and courteous. I had the composite on my front tooth repaired by them, and then I decided to splurge on a whitening treatment, and they offered to resurface my composite to change the color to match my whiter teeth. If your teeth are sensitive, dont hesitate to ask for the lidocaine, and they wont hesitate to inject it. Theres nothing like feeling nothing! Users/KarlMogel

20070515 12:20:46 nbsp JohnWong, they also asked me for my SSN, but said theyd accept my insurance member number. I called up the insurance (Delta Dental) and they said my member number is the SSN and I would have to get my employer to change that. This sucks! Users/JoFeuerstein

20080405 15:39:10 nbsp I have been going here for 14 years and totally enjoy their office.  I agree that they always seem to keep up to date on the latest technology and have staff that has been with them for years.  Ive had many different types of dental work done here and Ive always been satisfied with the service Ive received. Users/loneshark

20080527 13:44:26 nbsp Ive been going to Dr. T for about 7 years now, and have always been very happy with the service he and his staff provide. I am very picky about my dentist and would never go anywhere else. Users/NotSure

20101008 08:32:58 nbsp I have gone to Dr. Thomas several times and found him to be very good.  However, the management of his office leaves much to be desired.  If you have insurance, dont give them any money up front as you will be pulling teeth to get it back.  They will present you with services and products to spend that money on.  They dont automatically mail your money back to you.  Their dental hygienist said to me that I needed a deep cleaning of some back teeth or I would lose them.  So I finally agreed and the only deep cleaning I got was of my pocketbook.  So save yourself $835 and get a deep cleaning kit called Waterpik at Target.  natacami Users/jm7sumner

20110123 20:53:41 nbsp I totally agree with jm7sumner. The dentist is nice as well as his hygienist. But their bookkeeping and billing are so confusing that you better pay your copay with your insurance statement in you hands and make sure you account has a 0 balance after you pay. I had a major treatment done and paid my portion up front. When I realized I paid much higher than it should be, I asked to get my money back. They wouldnt answer me until I went to the office and asked for the office manager. She sat down with me to do the math and had to agree that I overpaid for that treatment. However, she rightaway pointed to me that I owed the office that much amount for a panoramic xray I took 4 years ago that insurance didnt pay :0(. Of course I didnt get my money ($300) back but they lost 5 customers (my whole family) from that day. Users/CathyLee

20110929 16:26:54 nbsp They definitely have a profit driven business modelforget the fact that youre a student on a tight budget. Despite being told repeatedly I dont want any more cleanings than the insurance pays for, they continue to pester me, and dont bother telling you that deep cleaning is not covered completely. Well, $80 may not seem alot to them! So they have a fascade of polite customer service, but they have revealed themselves to be greedy capitalists that you have to protect your pocketbook from.
