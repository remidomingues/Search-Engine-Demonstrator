20100422 20:07:04 nbsp Hi Bryan (I assume?) and Welcome to the Wiki.  You posted some beautiful work over the business page for Bryan Green Photography.  Please be sure to check out the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner welcome.  As it stands, the business page is very advertisey (glossy in Wiki parlance, referring to a glossy flier).  As a part of its 501(c) nonprofit status, the Wiki cant be used for outright advertising.  Im going to make a Bryan Green Photography/Talk talk page for it so people can share ideas on how to make it a bit more wiki pageish.  Again, welcome to the wiki, and I hope youll hang out and join in the discussion! Users/TomGarberson
