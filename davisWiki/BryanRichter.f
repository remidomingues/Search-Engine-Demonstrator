Name: Bryan Richter

Im just adding this so the page exists. Might add more later.

I graduated UCD in 05 with Computational Physics; I am a http://catb.org/jargon/html/meaningofhack.html hacker, a http://www.nethack.org/ gamer, and a participant in DARSL. I work for http://www.iradeon.com iRadeon as a technology guru, and hope to go back to grad school in 07. I also hope to perform in a metal band as a drummer before then.. bassists, guitarists, and vocalists wanted. :P
