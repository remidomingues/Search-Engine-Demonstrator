Candidate Statement

I want to encourage equal opportunities for us to participate on campus. Money and time are daunting obstacles to graduating with all the benefits our University has to offer. People should be able to afford the things they need and have the time to mange network and be a part of the thriving community UCD has to offer.


Elections are Feb 19  22 starting and ending at 8am.

PLEASE INVITE YOUR FRIENDS

I believe in equalizing the opportunities on campus for everyone, and making the university into what its meant to be. A center for the development of young minds and lifelong friends.
Remember to vote in the ASUCD elections. Please forward this to your friends at Davis. Ill happily answer any questions or concerns regarding my platform and plans for Senate.


I’m not going to make false promises of “MORE BIKE RACKS” or “REPAIRING THE STREETS”, these are important issues but they are outside the authority of the ASUCD Senate.
I’m going to make promises I can actually deliver!

I will work in ASUCD for EASIER ACCESS TO CLASS MATERIAL and expanding the ACCESSIBILITY TO THE FOOD PANTRY.

I’m apart of the leadership of the Student Alumni Association, copresident of the Golden Key Honors Society, and the founding treasurer of the Davis Aggie Lions Club, a charter of an international community service organization.

I’m in love with UC Davis for all the blessings it has to offer.

I love our strong ethnic communities, our thriving Greek system, our dedicated athletes, our progressive LGBT community and our environmental activists.

We are the best and the brightest, not just in grades but in participation and leadership; we are a student body of future executives, researchers and scholars.
ASUCD needs to seek out new sources of revenue and developing more events and programs to make campus more accessible and attending class easier.
To help ASUCD accomplish this it should EXPAND THE FOOD PANTRY and ACCESS TO CLASS MATERIAL.


· FOOD PANTRY  Everyday hundreds of students will skip a meal, replacing it instead with caffeine and snacks. The Food Pantry is meant to ensure no student is without the basic necessities of a reasonable lifestyle, including food and toiletries, but unfortunately it does not have to the supplies to help everyone in need.

BY PARTNERING WITH CAMPUSORGANIZATIONS AND REACHING OUT TO LOCAL FOOD RETAILERS, ASUCD CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CARE AND SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS.

The benefits of this, reach far beyond the students who checkout supplies from the Pantry. The entire student body will see an improvement on campus; our friends will be able to participate far more of their time and effort when they have a full stomach. ASUCD has a duty to represent all students and the Pantry is an excellent way to help those who are in need and ensure no one goes hungry on campus!


· EXPANDING ACCESSIBILITY TO CLASSES  Life happens and when it throws unexpected obstacles and obligations our way we still need to access our class material. From extracurriculars to families and friends, we all want to live a life while going to school.

PROVIDING DESIGNATED NOTETAKERS (BEYOND THE LIMITED SERVICE OF THE STUDENT DISABILITY CENTER), AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS OF LECTURES AND ENCOURAGING PROFESSORS TO USE LESSEXPENSIVE OPENSOURCE TEXTBOOKS

ASUCD CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE STRESS OF ATTENDING CLASSES. Technology allows for unprecedented access to information and class material, and ASUCD should be working hard to innovate the way we succeed academically.


POSITIVE POLICY DOES NOT STOP THERE! Senators need to be continuing the tradition of ASUCD and progressing into the future. New sources of revenue can pay for MORE SCHOLARSHIPS, more events and more student programs and this should be the responsibility of all the ASUCD leadership.

VOTE BRYCE #1 and BEST for the REST!
