Just a regular schmoe wanting to make more of himself. After a brief stint as a paramedic student Ive changed goals (not because of bad grades, personal indifference actually) and I want to become an electrician. I sometimes feel like the only surfer in Davis and despite there being a Davis Surf Club fabled surf club in this town I am yet to find it.

I recently (a month or so) quit smoking, its awesome.

On some days you can see me driving around and other days youll see a surfboard on top of my car (usually early early morning or when I come back to town) In town youll see me either riding a Longboarding longboard, rarely a bicycle and most likely you may never see me. )
