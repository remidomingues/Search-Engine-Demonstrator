20090514 14:23:41 nbsp I Have been to Buckeye Several times and I think that it is my favorite tack store in the area. They are very helpful, and can help you find just what you need. The store is a little crowed (With Horse supplies, not people), so sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. None the less, It is a GREAT little big store! Users/Jumpergem
