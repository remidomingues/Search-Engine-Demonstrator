One of the Upscale Restaurants fanciest restaurants in the nearby area, the Buckhorn is modeled after a hunting lodge. If you or your companion cant stand the thought of eating in a room decorated with the trophy heads, ask for a seat in the DeVilbiss Room. It is Victorian in decor and lacks hunting trophies. This room is only open on busier days, so if you go early in the week, you may be out of luck.

The menu varies from visit to visit and often features fresh game, as well as, of course, more ordinary steak steaks. A typical date for two will generally run about $70, which is an excellent deal for the high quality food and atmosphere. It is an excellent place for an anniversary or similar celebration. The owner walks the room and remembers customers.

If you fill out the survey included with your check, they will mail you a gift coupon worth $10 total off of two dinner entrees for your birthday and/or anniversary.

Advance reservations are highly recommended.

The Putah Creek Cafe (also owned by the Buckhorn) and Palms Playhouse The Palms are both across the street.

20050223 11:25:53 nbsp I love the Buckhorn! Its great for celebrations with friends because youll get a quality steak/seafood type meal (pasta dishes as well) in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Winters being an ag town, theres no real dress code, and the adjoining bar area makes real drinks... not so much those nasty sweet drunk chick drinks. To top it off, the Buckhorn is right across the street from Palms Playhouse The Palms, which makes for an exceptional evening out! Users/AlphaDog

My fiancee and I recently tried out the Buckhorn even though were vegetarian.  Admittedly, were pretty bold in going to a steak and roadhouse and werent expecting too much in the way of vegetarian friendly cuisine, but Ive gotta tell you, the folks at the Buckhorn (especially our waiter who had the slowest drawl Ive heard) were extremely kind and accommodating.  The food is just unbeatable and we took home a fair deal of our entrees with our bellies full and not too much damage to the pocket book.  Simply excellent, must try.  Users/TylerFelix

20060602 01:20:12 nbsp Im pretty sure that waiters slow drawl was fake!  We had this waiter there recently that was really nice, with a thick southern accent.  When my GF asked him where he was from, he suddenly lost the accent.  Pretty funny.  Food and service was excellent though.   Users/DudeNude

20061002 16:08:44 nbsp The steak is awesome, the appetizers are delicious, the service is fantastic, best steak in the area. 5 stars.  Users/AaronDarling

20070608 17:05:12 nbsp They make great steak and awesome hamburgers, no doubt about it.  However, the service isnt great and there is usually a wait for dinner.  That being said, its the best steak restaurant around and it is very reasonably priced. Users/AcMach

20070718 16:09:46 nbsp I ate at the buckhorn for the first time a few weeks ago and it was fantastic.  I had the special steak (the one with the cherry sauce) and it was super tender.  They also make an incredible mushroom soup.  It wasnt cheap, but it was worth it. Users/AlexPomeranz

20080305 07:50:34 nbsp Went their last night for my birthday with my parents and girlfriend.  It had been a few years and oh boy it was simply wonderful.  We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation and they had no issues seating us early.  We ordered a round of drinks which arrived promptly and the server had no problems giving us time to relax and talk before placing our order. The bread was soft and yummy, the soups are simply outstanding, and the variety of steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection and seriously large.  Not a single one of us finished our plates.  My girlfriend had brought a cake which they had stored for us and then brought out at the end of the meal already unboxed with candles flaming.  Our server cut the pieces for us and wow what an awesome night.  Always attentive, never overly aggressive.  All the food was prepared wonderfully.  The prices were so attractive considering what you are getting.  Nice bottle of Zinfandel from a wine list that had a nice selection.  Such an easy going place that has no attitude and simply serves some of the best steaks in  the area.  Loved it! Users/loneshark

20080401 23:17:34 nbsp I ate here for the first time about a month ago.  Of course I knew about it because it so famous.  Also, I knew the food was outstanding because Ive attended events that they catered.  Anyway, my dinner date and I were there on a Saturday night.  We decided to go on a whim so we didnt have reservations.  It was packed, but we decided that it would be worth the wait.  And it was.  Our meals were glorious, the service was excellent and it had a nice ambience.  Definitely worth it.  I felt like I was on a real date.  And we had a good time before dinner drinking at the barwhich is really nice.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20090111 20:08:28 nbsp I came here for my graduation dinner a while ago, and a few months later for a special dinner with friends. Fun fancy place to go to (well, you dont have to be fancy  you can be in jeans and a tshirt, but I like a dress and heels) and everything is amazing tasting  even the soups and side veggies. Users/ChristyMarsden

20090517 00:17:13 nbsp Ive been coming to the Buckhorn a couple times a year as long as I can remember. One of my earliest restaurant memories was sitting at a table in the back room with a shirley temple, looking at the paintings (I was fascinated with the print of the Birth of Venus), and wondering just WHY the butter looked like ice cream...
Anyway, the food here is one of the best upscale deals around. My goto is the Bucks cut prime rib, which is enough to fill a bottomless pit like me when added to the incredibly rich soup they give you beforehand. Oh, and beware the mud pie they give at the mention of a birthday or other special occasion. You may regret eating more, but you wont be able to resist.
The prime rib is perfectly tender at mediumrare, with just the right amount of spice on the outside and never grisly. Theres a very nice, mild cream horseradish sauce to dab on it, which I love. It usually comes with roasted vegetables on the side, the green beans, broccoli, and asparagus are all WONDERFUL. Perfectly seasoned and still with plenty of crunch. Ive attempted to imitate the asparagus several times at home, but its just never quite so good.
Other things to note are the cream of mushroom soup (I hate mushrooms, actually, but this is so rich and creamy and you can just TASTE the butter), rack of lamb (its a special, but I recently found out if you make a reservation two weeks out with a request they can tweak the menu to include it), and of course the bread... warm and soft on the inside, crispy and flavorful on the outside, and with a quick swipe of salty butter across it its absolutely addictive. Id go just to get bread and soup.
Maybe Ill have the gall to try that sometime, but at the moment I just dont have the willpower to resist the scent of all that steak. Users/KBathory

20090612 23:45:16 nbsp It is just very very good at a reasonable price.  Better than more expensive steak houses like Ruths Chris. Users/dpmou

20090613 02:02:29 nbsp Great steak, decent prices, and a beautiful building. They offer Certified Angus Beef, which is supposed to be the best beef you can get that is actually from the U.S. Credentials aside, they are a great place to spend a special occasion if you dont mind dropping a few extra bucks. Oh, one last thing, theyre the only restaurant Ive yet seen in CA that offers a bison steak, which I am somewhat partial to. Users/JoePomidor

20100216 02:43:19 nbsp I just took my girlfriend here for Valentines Day and we were both very satisfied overall. First, I must mention that we had to wait 2030 minutes even after making reservations nearly a week in advance. This was easily forgiven because, besides the fact that it was Valentines Day and people were obviously eating very slowly, it gave us a chance to have a drink at the bar. The bartender was very sharp and the alcohol made the wait less frustrating.

when we were finally seated, we ordered the calimari as an appetizer. while the squid was of good quality, we both wished that there was some kind of dipping sauce. the caesar salad i ordered was VERY good! the dressing, plentiful cheese and freshlymade croutons were excellent. simple recipe executed fantastically. I had the baseball steak which is one of their premium cut sirloins and it was delicious. I usually like my steak cooked with brown edges and a bit of pink in the center, but buckhorn guidelines suggested i order it pink throughout so i did. it was juicy and came topped with a nice port wine sauce. i didnt even realize until the ride home that i never asked for a1 sauce, which i dont think has ever happened. the steak was accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, both of which were very nice. my girlfriend ordered the elk, which came with a mushroom sauce. she is a bit more of an adventurous eater than i am, but i was intrigued so i tried hers and it was great; it wasnt as gamey as i thought it would be. for dessert we split a sponge cake with berries and marscopone. that was lovely as well.

overall the service was great. of course this restaurant was not the best thing that ever happened to my wallet. i decided to go all out and get drinks, an appetizer and dessert in addition to the meals because it was valentines day. overall with tax and tip i spent almost $150. still, we plan to return. as soon as possible.

20100216 02:47:26 nbsp oh, i should also mention that this page suggests the DeVilbiss room for people who dont want to eat in a setting with tons of stuffed game. well you can sit in the DeVilbiss room, but only do so if you dont mind creepy paintings of white children everywhere...

20110816 14:34:29 nbsp UC Davis students have one of the bestvalue fine dining restaurants only 2030 minutes drive away from them. Buckhorn has food at similar (if not better) than a Ruths Chris or Mortons, but at about half the price. The bread, the sides, the variety of sizes, cuts and cooking styles of the meat (as well as different animals such as deer and bison), and finally the utterly todiefor chocolate cake (seriously, I cannot boost their chocolate cake enough, I have not tasted a better chocolate cake since  and Ive been searching for something nearly as good) all add up to a dining experience that will leave you stuffed and satisfied. In addition, a meal that includes appetizers, entrees and dessert (but without wine) will come out to about $90110 for two people, whereas at Mortons and Ruths Chris thats the price PER PERSON (and Ruths Chris food doesnt even rise to the level of Buckhorn let alone a Black Angus  Buckhorn has food comparable to Mortons). If youre a UCD student, seriously, go at the next opportunity, you wont regret choosing it over some snobby gourmet place or Mortons/Ruths Chris Users/boing3887
