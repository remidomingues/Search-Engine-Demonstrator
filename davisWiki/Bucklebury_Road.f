Bucklebury Road is one of the many Navigating Davis streets in Davis Village Homes neighborhood that are named after places or characters in J.R.R. Tolkiens books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

Both Rivendell Lane and Shire Lane branch off from Bucklebury Road.

Bucklebury is the name of the ferry where the four hobbits crossed the river, narrowly avoiding the Nazgul.
