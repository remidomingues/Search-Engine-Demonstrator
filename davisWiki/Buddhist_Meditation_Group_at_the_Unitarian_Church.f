The Buddhist Meditation Group of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis in Davis  We are a lay Buddhist meditation and study group. We have been meeting regularly since 1994. Generally, we follow a Theravadan practice but all are welcome and will find a comfortable environment for following their Buddhist practice. Please visit our website for more details.

To locate other Buddhist groups in Davis see Spiritual Organizations.
Wednesday Evening Practice  begins with an offering of candles, incense, and flowers. This is followed by a Responsive Invocation. There may be a short reading. We then sit for 30 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of walking meditation. We end with a reading of the Metta Sutta.

Offering

Reverence to the Buddha, the FullyAwakened One. Reverence to the Dhamma, the wellspoken teaching of the Buddha. Reverence to the Sangha, the community of the Awakened One.

With brightly shining light, gloom is abolished;
I learn from the Awakened One, light of all worlds, who dispels darkness.

With this sweet incense, blended with fine ingredients, isolation is abolished;
I come to a community of seekers of insight informed by the dhamma of the Buddha.

With these flowers, colorful and fragrant, fear is abolished;
As with every living thing that blooms and fades, so must this body undergo decay.

Responsive Invocation

Metta Sutta

This is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace: Let them be able and upright, straightforward and gentle in speech. Humble and not conceited, contented and easily satisfied. Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.
Peaceful and calm, and wise and skillful, Not proud and demanding in nature. Let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove.

Wishing in gladness and in safety, may all beings be at ease. Whatever living beings there may be, whether they are weak or strong, omitting none, The great or the mighty, medium short or small, The seen and the unseen, those living near and far away, Those born and tobeborn, May all beings be at ease!

Let none deceive another, Or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or illwill Wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, So with a boundless heart Should one cherish all living beings: Radiating kindness over the entire world Spreading upwards to the skies, And downwards to the depths; Outwards and unbounded, Freed from hatred and illwill.

Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down
Free from drowsiness,
One should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding. By not holding to fixed views, The purehearted one, having clarity of vision,
Being freed from all sense desires,
Is not born again into this world.
