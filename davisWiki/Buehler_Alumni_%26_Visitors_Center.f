This building, the interior, and the grounds are magnificent, since this is the image the university wishes to portray to alumni and visitors. This is the opposite of the temporary buildings.

The Center is used as an art galleries art gallery. Art is displayed in two downstairs hallways: in the hallway around the reception room to the west, and in the hallway to the north of the boardroom. These shows are promoted and occasionally have receptions to go along with them. This is not just incidental art.

The rest of the art changes, but the Xmetal horse (Untitled (Horse), 1992) just inside the front doors hasnt moved. It is worth visiting just to see this sculpture.X Its been removed now. :
