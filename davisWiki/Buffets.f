So, you want to stuff your face with delicious restaurant caliber food but you dont want to pay much for it.  Well, an allyoucaneat buffet is probably a good choice.  We attempt a rating of all of the local allyoucaneat establishments below.  Please, add your own ratings and update the average rating.

In case it isnt obvious, AYCE means All You Can Eat.  Not all buffets are  although sometimes people assume they are  so note if they are or are not. Also, not every All You Can Eat meal is a buffet  some are served by waiters (a buffet means guests serve themselves). The rule is that if you are served, you are expected to give them a tipping tip. If you serve yourself (buffet), you are not expected to leave a tip. Some people disagree and say you need to tip $1/person... but what service are you tipping for, anyway?

   AYCE sushi, tolerable but not great.  Odd choices (black fish eggs?) and very annoying music.  Service is poor and somewhat hostile. Rating4.5   Users/rfrazier
   Seems very similar to Fuji Chef in terms of overall sushi quality and selection. This place carries some minor advantages over Fuji such as slightly classier atmosphere and more attentive servers.  The music does at times have a frantic Europop feel that reminds one of the Initial D arcade game at the MU. Rating7.5   Users/ScottMeehleib
   Very similar to Fuji Chef as it was started by one of their former chefs.  I personally will never comeback here again as I had 2 separate horrible experiences all about 34wks apart. I love salmon sashimi and loved buffets for that reason.  1st bad experience I ordered a plate of salmon sashimi and it smelled like a dead rat.  after quietly bringing it to the attention of the manager, he went in the back and brought out another plate.  But to my dismay, it smelled horrible too.  He got frustrated and blamed it on the cut of fish.  We paid our bill and promptly left.  We gave them some time and went back about 3wks later and ordered our normal stuff, but I was a little apprehensive about the salmon.  Reluctantly, we ordered a plate and it was fine, but our 2nd and 3rd had a very distinctive odor... much like rotting flesh. After my wife started gaging, we again promptly paid our bill and left vowing never to return. Rating2  Users/Aaron.Curtin

   AYCE sushi, freshly prepared. It floats on boats and you pick off which you want. Very popular around lunchtime; long wait. Especially tasty potstickers be sure and try them. Youll never apologize for bringing anyone here. (Except, I suppose, if they hate sushi...) Rating7  Users/SteveDavison
   Ive been there for lunch.  I was impressed by the quantity, found the quality to be fairly decent, but the selection did not impress me.  Since then, Ive heard that you can request specific items from the chefs.  Ill have to try that next time.  I did like the vegetable items more than many places.  I give it a rating6.  Users/JabberWokky
   Its a good place to eat lots of good sushi. The people are nice althought there is a long wait for lunch always. This shows their popularity. Its also a very good and standard place to go for dinner. Rating7  Users/MikeHeller
   Ive gone here for lunch quite a bit, and I consider it to be the best buffet in Yolo County. If you go up to the Chefs, Id suggest asking for shrimp tempura (the super long shrimp they use in the sushi) or large platters of smoked salmon (they will give you platters with about 15 pieces for you and friends if you ask.) Rating8.5  Users/PhilBerghuis
   I find that the spicy tuna roll here is quite bad and the rice seems slightly over cooked and its not cold. however most items are decent, eventhough they have been sitting out for a while (the soft shell crab is really good here, everything else is mediocare). However, i leave this place bloated, and yet not really satisfied. the sushi in the buffet is mediocare at best, and while they have a lot of variety, it allways seems like nothing looks that great.  this place, while decent, is not as good as people say it is. Nobu Hiro has a way better and much fresher sushi buffet.  i only go to fujis now if a large group of friends are going and i come along for the company. Rating5.75  Users/MattHh
   This is some of the better sushi that Ive had, especially for being this far inland. I would say it to be on par with Mikuni Sushi in the Sacramento area. They tend to put a little bit too much avocado in some of their rolls for my taste, but Im not a huge fan of avocado anyways. I would not suggest going to the actual buffet, though. While it is a quaint little sitting with miniature sushi boats going by that you can grab, the quaintness of it is overcome by the bad quality of the sushi. Get a table, and pick what youd like out of the menu. I suggest the Alaskan roll. Rating7.5 Users/DrewKimzey
   If you can eat a lot of sushi and you dont really mind waiting or high quality sushi, Fuji Chef is the place for you. During peak lunch hours it can be  dangerous trying to get a roll, especially if you are picky or only like popular rolls. On the bright side, you can make special orders (if you can get a word in). Overall, I left full and happy, if not a bit disheveled. Rating7  Users/arianemetz
   Excellent food, the lines have gone down a bit (maybe do the economy) which means that this is an even better choice.  All you can eat, anything on their menu (including sashimi).  Great value for the dollar.  Rating8.5   Users/rfrazier
   Truly just astonishingly bad. Cruddy selection, everything tastes the same, they informed me that they do not even serve inari during lunch. really just awful. Rating2

  Jusco Jusco Japanese Restaurant  average rating as of 20080908 3.3
   MonSun $10.99 lunch, MonThurs $14.99 dinner; FriSun $15.99 dinner.
   Allyoucaneat sushi, but not a buffet: you mark your selection on an order form and they bring the food to your table. Note: they kept overlooking things which I marked on the form, but you can always reorder. They also tried to push extra food off on customers (but you dont have to take it).  Many people there were trying to use a halfprice coupon, only to learn of the many restrictions they placed on their usage: two people, must be finished before 12:30PM, valid Tue for guys, Wed for girls.  They also threaten to charge 50 cents/piece of uneaten sushi, so be sure to clean your plate. Rating5  Users/SteveDavison
    Is it legal for them to do that if the coupon doesnt list the restrictions?  It seems like false advertisement to me and I wasnt too happy about it. Also, they didnt accidentally overlook things you mark. The guy in charge specifically tells the waiters to ignore certain customers or to stop bringing them food. They wont say it in English, but they do say it.
   We went to Jusco quite frequently for dinners  theyre just OK kind of sushi  not comparable with Nobus or Fujis. Youd always get seats since not many people go there. For this reason, they try to bring you more food than you order, so that if you leave some sushi rice, you pay fine. Nice way of making money. Apart from that they charged more in our credit card ($24 every time). From our approximately 20 visits they chited almost $60 from my credit card. They are well comparable to blood sucking silent parasites. Users/MikeHeller
   We go to Jusco quite frequently for weekend lunches  theyre affordable, have nice variety, their fish is good (slightly better than Fuju chef, imho), and they dont have the 300 person lines at Fuji chef.  Ive always appreciated that they bring around extra food  it lets them offer more variety, given that they have such a tiny restaurant, and are limited to available counterspace.  Staff is really really nice, and while theyre always full, Ive never had to wait for a table.  Also, in my experience, most allyoucaneat sushi restaurants penalize for not eating the rice  it drives their costs up when you only eat the fish (takes more to fill up) and then all that rice is wasted too...  So I guess I have to respectfully disagree with your assessment on that one. Users/KrisMartinsen
    They sound nice in English.  If you understood everything that was said, youd be pretty pissed.
     What do they say? Also, its fun to sometimes write fake threatening letters from credit card agencies making it clear that they are under investigation for adding extra charges to credit cards. Theyll probably get scared. Users/MichaelGiardina
       Great idea! Lets try to make them scared by doing something illegal ourselves! users/IdealParadigm
   I used to recommend Jusco when the line at Fujis was too long, but I think they recently changed owners or something, and the last time I went, the shrimp tempura was fried frozen so the inside was cold and still in its shell. The only thing I will give them credit for is that they use more wasabi in the sushi and have a wider selection of nonsushi in their buffet than Fujis. Rating2 Users/PhilBerghuis
   Rating  0 Yeah, I know the scale doesnt include 0, but the bad food AND Shadiness Factor shady business practices have ensured that I am NOT a repeat customer.  Users/MarieHuynh
   Rating  3 The worst of the Japanese buffets. Fish really tasted old and fishy. After first serving of raw items, I only ordered cooked ones. The scallop was downright unedible Users/MattHh
   Rating  6.5 I love this place, it has very good taste for the amount of money that you pay. A lot of people like to make fun of the guy who doesnt speak fluent English, but hes really nice and understanding. users/IdealParadigm

  Nobu Hiro average rating as of 20050610 7.3
   Lunch: MonThu $9.99, FriSun(and Holidays) $10.99. Dinner: MonThu $14.99 (note: dinner buffet is studentsonly!)
   You sit at a counter just across from the chefs. You tell them what you want (from the menu in front of you) and they make it on the spot. When I was there the traffic was light, so I felt as I had personal service. They are eager to please. If you want topquality, affordable, sushi without the wait of Fuji, this may be the place for you. Rating6  Users/SteveDavison
   I went to Nobu Hiro for the first time earlier this week and it was great.  You order from a defined list, but they have a good selection on the list and very friendly chefs. Users/PaulLanzi
   This is also very good place for lots of good sushi. Great place for a decent dinner too. Rating8  Users/MikeHeller
   well i really think there is no question that this is the best sushi buffet in Davis.  Nobu Hiro puts Fuji to shame.  the sushi is made fresh to order off their buffet menu (this includes about 15 or so types of nigiri sushi, and several rolls like the monkey roll, california roll, spider roll, dragon roll(might be called something else), eel cucumber roll, davis roll(called something else here),bay roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy tuna hand roll, avacado roll, cucmber roll, egg and vegetable roll, tuna roll and much more.  the menu also includes miso suop, vegetable temmpura, chicken katsu, fried rice and some noodle dish if you want, but i usually just get the sushi).  the spicy tuna roll here is much closer to the ones im used to in LA, although not quite as good, it is quite tasty and definatly beats Fujis spicy tuna roll, which is really just a tuna roll with a lot of hot suace oozing around the edges.  and guess what, unlike fujis, the sushi tastes fresh.  Nobu Hiro is not too busy, so you shouldnt have to wait for a table, but there are allways several people there.  they do have a sign that says that 2 dollars might be charged for left over food, but i do not think this is enforced because they give the bill before your done (its probably to stop people from wasting tons of food, if you left a few rice balls i doubt anything would come of it, just dont leave plates and plates of waste). plus its a dollar cheaper than fuji too. Rating8.25 Users/MattHh
   This is a good sushi buffet. THough It lacks in variety and service. I and 4 other people sat at the window table and didnt get half of the stuff we ordered. Also we were hurried out, the staff kept asking us if we were done yet and werent giving us any attention. Rating7.0
   the last comment reflects a trend i have noticed about this place.  here you want to sit at the sushi bar, you will get wonderful promt service and not be hustled by the waiters, because other than water refills, you will only be dealing with the sushi chef, who is excellent and friendly.  if you look on Nobu Hiros page you will notice this trend as well.  So make sure you sit at the sushi bar, so you can enjoy the fresh all you can eat sushi, if you sit at a table the service may detract from the great sushi. Users/MattHh
   I love this place! As long as you sit at the bar, service is fast and good. The Sake (salmon) nigiri is delicious with soysauceandwasabi, and their dishes are always freshly made. They may be further away than Fuji Chef Fujis but the superior service, fresher selection, and cheaper price mean they will always be my first choice. Rating9 Users/JoePomidor

   Good selection for a reasonable lunch price. Rating6  Users/RichardFlink
   there is a lot to choose from and the generals chicken is quite good, everything else is pretty average, especially the postickers.  similar tasting food to other amaricanized chinese places in Davis.  their fried meats are crispier than most places as well.  I think it might also be better to eat here before 12, since their dishes dont seem to turn over that often.   Rating6  Users/MattHh
   My favorite Chinese buffet so far.   GWCs fried foods are cooked especially well  crispy but without excess grease.  Their soups are also quite good.  All the trays are constantly being refilled, so things stay fresh.  Most of the buffet menu dishes appear every day, with a few different items that seem to rotate in and out.

   this might just be the best buffet in Davis.  There isnt really even a comparison between Rajas and Kathmadu.  Kathmadu has a way larger selection and better quality food. Rating8.0 Users/MattHh
   I already love Kathmandu it is no surprise that I find their buffet exemplary. My one concern is that they often dont have many vegetarian options out, especially since they have so many of them on their regular menu! The service, however, is usually very good. Overall, if you want to have a leisurely, delicious lunch, no one in town beats Kathmandu. Rating8.  Users/arianemetz

   I counted 8 courses, not 14 courses like their sign says. Rating5  Users/SteveDavison
     I think you can get to 14 courses if you count every sauce/garnish/side item.  Users/JevanGray Jevan
     Add water too while counting the 14 items.  Users/MikeHeller
     I think the 14 courses refers to the 14 dishes they make throughout the week... The buffet changes daily, with the same basics...  Rajas is actually a decent place to go if youre a Vegetarians vegetarian because there are usually one or two main dishes that are vegggie.  Also, Rajas lets you take a togo box and fill it from the buffet, which is cool if youre really Living Cheaply broke. Users/SummerSong sss
        Well I havent rechecked in detail since it changed management, but there were exactly 14 different containers in the buffet. Users/JevanGray Jevan
   They do change the courses from day to day. But while they dont have 14 in one day, they still have enough to make it worth it. Also, I think its on thursdays, they have pakura in a curry sauce that is freaking awesome. Rating7  Users/PhilBerghuis
   Raja is a good deal, but not that great quality. the indian food here is worse than Kathmandu Kitchen, most places in LA, and most places in the bay area, however it is also cheaper. you pay for what you get. if your not looking to spend the money for Fujis and other more expensive buffets this is a cheap alternative that isnt bad.  but Kathmandu Kitchen is far superior for just a buck more. Rating5.5  Users/MattHh
   As a vegetarian, I sometimes appreciate the selections available at Ali Babas more than Kathmandu. Plus, you cant beat the service, especially from the Owner (he is the owner right?). I feel so comfortable in this restaurant, it reminds me of lunch at my friends house in High School. For me, the combination of good food, great service and a good price is a winner for me. Rating7.5  Users/arianemetz
   Delicious food, best Indian in Davis, very good prices.  The only issue is parking and due to the size there can be a bit of a wait.  Rating7.5   Users/rfrazier

 Pizza 

  Mountain Mikes Pizza average rating as of 20100131 7.5
   AYCE Pizza and salad bar lunch buffet is $6.49 and is available from 11am2pm. They have a dinner buffet on Wednesday nights for $7.49.
    They have a few different varieties out, and will usually take requests which will be out partway into your lunch.  They have a card for their lunch buffets, buy X (I think 8 or 10) and get one free or half off.  Not very informative, I know, but I dont have the card with me and I havent been in a while.  The people working there are always quite friendly, and its usually not too crowded.  Quality TVs! Rating7.5Users/TomGarberson

   The selection usually consists of two or three pizzas, along with a platter of fleeting garlic twists. You need to get to the food fast, though, because youll have to do battle with a thousand screaming children in order to get any food on your plate. The kitchen seems to be regularly swamped and cannot put out new pizza anywhere near as fast as people take it. Rating1 Users/JoePomidor

  Woodstocks Pizza average rating as of 20100131 5.5
   $6.99 AYCE or (single slice and a soda $2.75)
   AYCE pizza slices for a limited time. Ive had their pizza, but not their pizza buffet, so Im not giving this a rating, however what I recall of their pizza was that the crust was quite hard and the toppings thin. Otherwise, its sort of a nice college hangout.  Users/SteveDavison
   Personally, I LOVE Woodstocks Pizza.  The sauce is the best (edit: Have they changed the recipe?  The last time I was there, it wasnt as good as I remember it).  That said, the slices leave a little to be desired mostly because of the thin toppings problem described above.  Give me a good double pepperoni ANY day.  For those of us with limited stomach space, try the single slice and a soda deal for $2.75  Rating6 (AYCE), Rating7 (single slice option)   Users/OddBall
   Way too greasy. Not much variety. Ditto on thin toppings. Tastes are personal but this is one of the worse pizzas I have had here. Rating4 (AYCE)  Users/AmitSahoo
   I love Woodstocks pizza, but Im not a fan of the AYCE slices.  Even when theyre fresh out of the oven, the pizzas arent that interesting.  I think they probably do try to save a bit by using less sauce and less of the toppings.  Ive been 3 or 4 times for the AYCE, and one time they agreed to make a BBQ bird when I asked.  Most of the time, though, they wont do requests. Rating5 Users/TomGarberson

   If you can get past the fact that they are a Sodexho cafeteria service, youll find that this sparkling new building has a lot to offer. They have 7 (or so) islands, each serving a different cuisine. Stirfry, burritos, hamburgers and hotdogs, and a salad bar with freshlooking spinach, they have it all. Everyone, not just students, can eat here. You will, of course, be surrounded by students. This place is quite noisy; I dont know why they dont consider these things. The nice lady at the cash register gave me an introductory description when I mentioned I hadnt been there before. Unfortunately, she didnt mention that they were closing in one minute... Backpacks are not allowed in (by order of the fire marshall), but they have free, secure, lockers just outside where you can stash your stuff (take note, Mondavi Center). A wide variety of fresh, tasty, and nutritious food at a competitive price. Rating7 Users/SteveDavison

 Rating Criteria 
Average rating is all the ratings under a given restaurant added together and then divided by the number of ratings.  This should be edited when someone adds a new rating. This gives a good sense of how people like the restaurant on average.

My ratings refer solely to food quality and taste. They do not reflect the color of the walls, the folds of the napkins, etc. I have evaluated each of these places in a four week period in early 2005 (JanuaryFebruary) with at least two days between each.

After evaluating each of these places, the biggest differentiator (for the Chinese food Chinese restaurants) turned out to be the potstickers. I found them to be the indicator species, in other words, the item which reflected the overall food quality in an amplified way. Users/SteveDavison
