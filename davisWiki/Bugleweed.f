Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans) is a durable and colorful flowering ground cover suiting a variety of environmental conditions and color schemes. Bugleweed is native to Europe, western Asia and Iran. Depending upon the variety, flowers range from white to purpleblue while the foliage may be green to bronze or purple with some variegated forms. The flowers are about 1/2 long and borne in whorls on erect spikes 610 tall Â— these are typical mint flowers. In Davis, ajuga is an evergreen perennial and blooms from early spring until midsummer.

Ajuga is a member of the mints mint family (Lamiaceae), and like most mints its rapid growth rate can make it invasive; bugleweed can easily become a persistent weed in lawns that are watered regularly. Bugleweed grows rapidly even in poor, heavy soils and grows along the ground, spreading by underground runners to create a thick carpet of foliage. Ajuga tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and may be grown in any type of light from full sun to full shade. Like other mints, ajuga prefers moist soil, but will tolerate drought; crown rot can be a problem.
