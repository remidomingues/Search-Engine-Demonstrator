Buildering is the practice of Climbing climbing the outside of buildings or manmade structures.  Buildering is extremely dangerous. Climbing usually involves ropes and safety protection when one gets over a few feet above ground. But protection is relatively rare in buildering.  It also is quite often illegal and thus is commonly done at Night time night to reduce the risk of attracting Police the authorities.

List of Davis Buildering sites:

 By far the coolest of any buildering sites is the Social Science and Humanities (UCD Death Star) building on UCD. Every roof can be reached, there are problems all over the place, and the roofs are some of he highest in town, allowing views for miles and beautiful star gazing. The most fun problems are getting past the locked glass doors on the elevator towers.
 Young Hall has a series of pipes and shelves and windows to climb on the east side. Plenty of cool things up top, and the roof door is usually unlocked....
 The Outdoor Adventures building has a few climbing holds bolted to the outside to give you a start.
  Buildings A through M in Tercero are ridiculously easy to climb. If you can do a pullup or two and manage not to get caught by a Resident Advisors resident advisor then you can be on the roof in no time. Getting locked out of your room is never a problem as long as you have practiced your buildering skills.
  The roofs of Davis Senior High School are fairly easy and enjoyable to climb.  There is a nearly limitless supply of ways to get on the interconnected roofs covering the MPR, Old Music buildings, the entire science wing, the girls locker room, and dance room.  A newly installed metal ladder permits easy access to the roof of the dance room from the roof above the girls locker room.  The best time to climb at Davis High is on a Saturday night because the school isnt in use or being tended to by staff or janitors.
Rumour has it that now there are cameras watching DHS at night Users/StevenDaubert Daubert
        Have explored said rumor. There are ways around the cameras, and the crime of climbing a roof isnt worth them going through the process of identifying a criminal from back footage and processing charges etc. Late night custodialism is a much more present threat. Users/StephenHudson
  Everson Hall is easy to climb. Theres a pipe to shimmy up on the southwest side, and then theres a ladder the rest of the way up. It is also possible to get inside the building via covered ladders (you have to lift the covers but they arent locked) that descend into the janitors closets.
  Bainer Hall has shallow offwidth to chimney problems of various sizes.  Kneebars and chickenwings for all.

  Its not very difficult to climb onto the lower roofs of the MU either. Simply climb onto the awning between freeborn and the MU and work your way about from there.
  Theres an even easier way to get on the MU: On the west side of it, near the south entrance to Lower Freeborn and by all the dumpsters, you can hop onto that ladder pretty easily. Theres a cover on the lower part of it, but also conveniently a protrusion in the wall to help you surpass it. Once you get up there, there are more ladders and walls to climb. And you can slide down the sloped zigzag roof over the MU picnic tables.
       Easiest way is on the south end, climb the stairs next to the coho entrance, and just walk over that roof leading east, my friend did this with a broken leg. Also, if you go left instead, you can hop onto the glass coho roof, or hop the wall at the end of the eating area and hide in an enclosed air conditioning unit.
  The Hallmark Inn, across from the Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 Holiday cinema has a 3 story faux stone wall thats climbable.

  It is possible, although fairly difficult in several cases, to get to the highest point of all the elementary, junior high, and high schools of Davis.

20100316 01:37:06 nbsp Both Nugget markets are climbable  the South Davis one has a ladder up the back (with an easily bypassable cover) and the Covell one has a small shed and series of pipes up the back. This page is in need of some serious revision. Users/THernandez
   So... revise it!  Youre the one in charge of keeping it up to date (along with everybody else).  It would be neat to get some photos of those inaccessible places, or photos of town from the places you mention like the highest point of all the elementary, junior high, and high schools.  Panoramic photos of town, even at night, would be great.  ...even if they were from a friend.  ;) jw
