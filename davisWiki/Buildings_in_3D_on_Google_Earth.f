Davis has a number of buildings modeled in 3D on Google Earth.  Google Earth is a software program created by http://www.google.com Google. It can be used to view satellite imagery, maps, 3D terrain, and 3D buildings. Google Earth can be downloaded http://earth.google.com/ here

3D buildings are modeled using http://sketchup.google.com/ Sketchup or http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html Building Maker. Sketchup is a 3D modeling program created by Google. It has a greater learning curve but gives you more power in modeling and lets you model in more areas. Building Maker is an online tool created by Google. It is much easier to learn but is only available in certain locations (e.g. Sacramento Area).

When you build a model using Building Maker it is automatically submitted to Google to be reviewed for inclusion in the 3D buildings layer in Google Earth. It must meet Googles http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/3dwh/acceptance_criteria.html#bettermodel Acceptance Criteria before it can be included. To submit a Google Sketchup model for inclusion in Google Earths 3D buildings layer you need to do the following. In Sketchup go to File > 3D Warehouse > Share Model. Input basic information about your model and make sure the check box next to Google Earth Ready: this 3D model is real, current and correctlylocated. is checked  if it is not, it will not be submitted for review. Provided your model meets Googles Acceptance Criteria it will be accepted into Google Earth.
