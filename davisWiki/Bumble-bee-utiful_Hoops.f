The maker of these hoops, was also awarded a grant from the City of Davis Art Contract Program in 2009 & 2010 for her project called Hoop Happenings. (http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid215215720117&vinfo) She created a series of community hooping events by providing music and many beautiful handmade hoops for people of all ages and backgrounds to play, experiment and dance with on the grass in Central Park. According to Kirsten, Physical movement, centripetal motions, and just engaging with the sacred circle are all great ways to connect to the earth, the cosmos, and a beautiful way of centering the body. Learning how to hoop and learning to dance with the hoop can be a really empowering activity, and a great physical way to be creative, stimulate circulation and release some endorphins. Anyone can hula hoop.

Hoops available in a variety of colors and sizes for everyone including children, beginners, advanced hoopers, professionals and even hoops large enough for double hooping.
