20050506 23:10:32 nbsp I had the misfortune of wasting about five hours at this place. The woman who runs the front office is a bit bitchy, and it took two appointments before they even started any real physical therapy. Users/AlphaDog

20060601 16:22:29 nbsp I was told by an intern at UC Davis Sports Medicine (who formerly worked at Burger) to go elsewhere for rehab. Users/KaiTing

20060601 19:15:56 nbsp Got referred here several years ago after ACL surgery. At the first visit they gave me a rubber band and one page of instructions. Cost my insurance a bunch of $. I never went back. Seemed like some sort of mill to me. Users/PaulThober

20060607 14:54:30 nbsp Patients of this clnic are routinely surveyed during or immediate following their course of therapy at the clinic. Approximately 50% of the patients return their surveys. For the most recent six month period 92% of the surveyed patients indicate they will return to the clinic if they required services in the future and in the area reception staff courtesy scored on a five point scale with 5 being the highest (outstanding) 86% of the responses were outstanding.

20060918 15:28:29 nbsp I was also referred to Burger for a knee injury.  This place seems to stay in business by charging insurance companies for full visits while the http://www.vitalethics.org/therapistassistantcourses/physicaltherapyschools physical therapist treats 45 people at once.  The appointments only really last 1015 minutes, then your bounced to a student intern and they ice you.  What a racket.  I highly recommend Physical Edge.  Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20060918 15:29:20 nbsp btw... I was never offered a survey, so Jeff is full of it. Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20070627 13:51:02 nbsp I was initially concerned because of the comments here, but maybe things have improved, because my experience was very positive. The receptionists that I spoke with on the phone and during my visit were very polite and helpful (my visit went the full hour). My PT Amanda was fantasticseemed very knowledgeable, asked a lot of questions, and answered all of mine.

Regarding the survey, I didnt get one, but I am glad, because surveys are a waste of my time and I dont fill them out.  Users/CharanRanganath

20080620 12:00:59 nbsp My experience there was very positive.  In fact, they were better than my doc, in terms of telling me specifically what muscles were affected, what preventative measures I could take, etc.
My doc just prescribed muscle relaxers, asked almost no questions, clearly didnt care to help me solve the problem, said id probably injured myself and itd go away eventually.  it didnt.  after 3 visits to my MD and over 3 months of pain, with severe neck/shoulder pain/spasms, managed to procure referral.

was the very best thing, since they gave me simple tips on what caused/exacerbated the problem, etc etc.  answered all my many questions. made me angry that my doc couldnt have taken the time to do that... really im surprised they have such bad reviews here.  i think perhaps they are outdated?

And the apptmts lasted the entire time, the therapists never saw other patients while seeing me.  Maybe they used to have poor service, but honestly Ive been there about a dozen times, and each and every time, the desk folks were super nice, the therapists were excellent.  I NEVER got a survey, so Im not sure Jeff is talking about....  If i HAD gotten a survey itd be 100% positive, I really recommend these folks, and their reasonably simple explanations and help, have made me realize I need to switch MDs.... Users/JessS

well a quick look is that all the negative comments are from 2006, and all the positive ones from 2008.  Perhaps they have had a better focus on customer service or something.  Users/rocksanddirt
