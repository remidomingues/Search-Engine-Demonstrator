Hi, Im a PhD student from the http://www.unikl.de University of Kaiserslautern in Germany. Im here for about 3 month in an exchange program called http://www.irtg.unikl.de IRTG, where I have a three year scholarship. My advisor here at UCD is Prof. Bernd Hamann. I will be here for another three month in 2006 and in 2007.

I like the town very much, and that is the reason why Im participating in this Wiki. Since I dont know very much, the only thing I can contribute is to comment on shops and places that I visited here, and possibly correct some mistakes on the pages.

BTW, the picture is a few years old, so dont expect me to look exactly like that. :)
