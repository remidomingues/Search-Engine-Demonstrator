http://www.burningman.com/ Burning Man is annual festival held at wiki:WikiPedia:Burning_Man Black Rock City, Nevada, emphasizing art, ecology and community.   This festival is popular not only with Davis locals, but also with Davis studentswith more than 100 Davisdwellers in attendance.  With over 35,000 temporary residents, Black Rock City is the largest temporary city in the world, but it also qualifies (for one week) as Nevadas fifth largest city.

Clothing is optional, and it has a reputation for debauchery (including alcohol, drugs, sex, etc.)  However, law enforcement is present and willing to uphold the law.

Events
The main event is the burning of a large wooden sculpture of a man on Saturday night.

Another notable event is http://pic.templetons.com/brad/photo/bm01/crtits/ Critical Tits an allfemale (although some men do join in) topless bike ride, in which there is a particularly bumpy stretch of trail, causing the womens breasts to bounce alluringly or painfully depending on size and your status as a bicyclist or bystander. The ride is usually followed with a free meal for the participants.


Since this festival has an environmentalist bent, has a leavenotrace (zero impact on the ecosystem), and emphasizes community, it makes sense that Burners from Davis would want to try to get a group together to go.  There is an official http://burningman.com/preparation/travel_info/rideshare.html Burning Man rideshare on their site.


20050822 10:40:59 nbsp Who are the many staff that Burning Man consists of? In its Senior Staff page, I only see one UCD alumni. And why wasnt he (or they) listed on this Burning Man page? I dont see enough of a connection to Davis that warrants this page. Any disagree? Users/JesseSingh

20050822 10:55:29 nbsp Jesse, you may not like this page, but its sufficiently related to Davis.   While I appreciate your thirst for specific data on who the UC Davis contributors of burning man are, I think the fact that only one of their 18 senior staff are UC Davis alumni suggests the opposite of what you think it suggests, really.

20050822 11:42:23 nbsp Check out http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/burningman.html the hypocracy of Burning Man Users/JimSchwab

20050822 14:35:56 nbsp Yeah, my brother loved Burning Man and went to it every year until it was ruined and became a sort of commercial theme park and the type of people attending it changed completely. Users/MikeIvanov

20050822 15:53:49 nbsp Well, I think its better enjoyed as an adventure and an escape.  Its gotten so big that its necessary to impose rules and tax commercial exploitation, otherwise it would be a bigger zoo than it is.  Its obviously not what it once was, but I dont think its hypocracy at stake.  In fact, if you look at the hypocracy article cited above, it looks like the author is upset that the originzation is trying to preserve the identity of Burning Man which would otherwise drift into archistic oblivion with so many participants these days.  Well, its huge now and things change, so Jamie Zawinski needs to get over it. Users/JaimeRaba
  His concern is that they attempt to control the publics perception of the event by not allowing free photographic reign.  Many businesses (such as Nugget) dont allow you to photograph inside their stores, and theyre perfectly within their rights to do that.  These restrictions may be contrary to the notions that many associate (whether these are deserved or not) with the festival, such as freedom, cooperation, and anarchy.  Its not just about them making some bucks off the photos, either, as they dont allow photographs of nudity, sexual activity, the use of drugs to be used by photographers.
   I think the restrictions are more of an attempt to protect those who may be engaging in the above acts but do not want images of themselves doing so to become more public than within the sphere of the event. Users/AmeliaCarlson aec
     Excellent point.  However, if the people were readily identifiable then the photographer would have needed them to agree to a model release of their image, because the photo wasnt taken in public (it was taken within a controlled businessed area).  Regardless, sometimes these releases are ignored and photos slip out where people are identifiable.  The legality of photos of people is murky so I can see the policy as advocating protection.

20101014 02:24:26 nbsp The Burning Man festival is a total maddening experience one will have in the lifetime.The burning of a 40 foot wooden man in the middle of the Black Rock Desret is only a small part of the 8 day festive. Burning Man festival is an event which has grown from being a beach party celebrating the summer solstice to the incarnation of personal freedom, radical self expression. If youâ€™re looking for a totally unique experience, The Burning Man Festival will provide you with one, but only if you participate.
