MMMmmm burritos. Those filling, nutritious, healthful, affordable, and vegetarianfriendly meals. I could live (and have lived) off them.

The burritos found in Davis are usually heavily influenced by the style developed in the wiki:sf:Mission District of San Francisco. That is to say, they are large, foil wrapped, have additional fillings over your standard burrito, and a super version is generally available. So... dont complain about Restaurants/Authenticity authenticity because the burritos arent like the ones youre used to in LA... welcome to Two States NorCal.

For those that like veggie burritos with vegetables in them, check out El Mariachi, El Toro Bravo, Tres Hermanas, and Taqueria Davis.

  Chipotle
   $4.95 for a vegetarian burrito.

  Chuys Taqueria
   Regular: $4.50+tax, Super: $6.50+tax. Chips are included. They serve them wet (with a bit of sauce poured on them) on a plate, with a garnish of shredded lettuce and a piece of tomato. The Regular contains rice, beans, and meat. The Super also has sour cream, sliced avocado, and cheese. They are taqueria size, meaning large. There is no vegetarian burrito on the menu. Since there is no salsa or other flavoring, they tend to be bland. Rating5 Users/SteveDavison

20050523 11:31:52 nbsp Random burrito thoughts: Dos Coyotes Pialla Burrito is one of my favorites in Davis.  Burritos from Guadalajara are better wet (with enchilada sauce).  I am not sure how La Esperanza stays in business (the food is expensive and not that good).  If youre in Sac and like Fish Burritos, try Pescados.  You can still get Nugget burritos in Woodland (I am not sure about South Davis). Users/AlexPomeranz
