Burrowing Owls are native to Californias Central California Central Valley, and unlike other owls of the area, they live underground. However, Burrowing Owls dont dig burrows themselves, but instead reuse abandoned groundsquirrel and other mammal holes. Burrowing Owls are diurnal, feed on insects and rodents, and normally produce 45 young a year. They are also exceedingly loyal to their nests, preferring to maintain a continuous home. They can live up to 910 years and longer in captivity. Burrowing Owls are currently threatened due to development encroaching onto the agricultural land they inhabit.

The burrowing owl is the mascot of the Yolo Audubon Society.  See their http://www.yoloaudubon.org/ website for a photo of this curious creature.

Some places to spot Burrowing Owls:
There are some Burrowing Owls at the end of Loyola Drive by the baseball field. The fencedin Calgene Inc. Calgene Greenhouse lot between the Davis Indoor Sports Center DISC and Schilling Robotics on 2nd Street has several Burrowing Owls. You can also find several in the walking/jogging path around the north and east side of Wildhorse Greenbelt Wildhorse, particularly the Wildhorse Agricultural Buffer ag buffer. Just drive north on Pole Line and pull over after the houses next to the Golf Course. Or from your car drive north on Mace Blvd around the bend at the edge of town, near the new Mace Ranch School. Several owls ironically hang out on a land developers sign on the edge of the fields, east side of the road. Also, The Colleges at La Rue was built on burrowing owl habitat and breeding areas in addition to Swainsons Hawks Swainsons Hawk (a state endangered species) foraging and nesting sites. If you catch the owls under the right conditions, you can have a walk at Wildhorse where they are popped up on either side of the path like muppets. You can go from never having seen one to having seen 10 in a matter of 20 minutes.
