Creating this page as a resource for those who have been victims of any types of business fraud in the Davis community.

Fraud includes, but is not limited to:

  Ohana Hawaiian BBQ Double charging credit cards
  Selling second hand items as new
  Overcharging/over billing
  Tax evasion or nondisclosure

Seems in this economic downturn, a few places are popping up on the radars of many of the honest, hardworking citizens of this city and its time we do something about it.

Steps to protect and prevent include:

  monitoring of the business
  informing the general public to prevent it from occurring again
  taking legal action (obviously the most time consuming and most frustrating)

Some things to keep in mind:

 Always check before you buy or try. Heard a rumor about a place and youre just not sure if theyre shady or on the up and up?  you might check the BBB (Better Business Bureau) for past complaints and compliance.  If you are the victim of a shady retailer or other business, file a complaint. The BBB does monitor and investigate and many times is instrumental in the recovery of losses and, in the worst case scenario, closure of the perpetrators.

Another source is www.Approva.net  Approva.   This company monitors and helps to recover losses due to credit card fraud for both businesses and individuals.

I know there are many sources up to and including involving the police.  If you know of any information that can help others, or are a victim yourself here in our beautiful little city, here is your opportunity to give something back and help to continue to make Davis the warm, inviting place I know it has been and can be again.

Sometimes, if the business still refuses, the credit card company will eat the charge for you. Users/KellyM
