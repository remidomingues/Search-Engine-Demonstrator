Welcome to the Wiki, business owner (or employee, representative, affiliate, ...)!  This is a place for people in the Davis community to come together and create a resource for themselves and their neighbors.  As a part of that community, wed love to have you contribute your point of view.  Heres an introduction to the Wiki that should help get you started on the right track.  You might also want to read the Welcome to the Wiki general welcome.

As always on the wiki, keep in mind that these arent rigid laws or rules.  They are guidelines and helpful tips to get you started in a positive way.  You cant use these to justify bad behavior.  Alternatively, theres a lot of forgiveness for new editors trying to figure things out, and any mistake you make can be fixed.  Everybody is welcome to edit the wiki, and there are plenty of people who will help out if you get confused or make a faux pas when getting started.

If youre confused by anything here, check out the Wiki Glossary.  If that doesnt do the trick, see Wiki Community/Seeking Help Seeking Help.

 Three Points to Remember 
The Wiki is a fun and fluid place that always has a lot going on and many different opinions on pretty much any topic that comes up.  It can take a little getting used to.  Here are three key points you should bear in mind while joining the Wiki community and interacting with your neighbors here:

 1. Business pages belong to the Davis community, not to the business.  Like every other page on the wiki, theyre written collaboratively by many members of the community.  Rather than trying to maintain a neutral, objective point of view, the Wiki tries to represent many different points of view.  You have more knowledge about your business than anyone else out there so your perspective is extremely valuable, but remember that yours is just one among the many voices contributing to the page.  Each editor (including you!) has equal say over the pages form and content.
 1. Business pages should be informational, rather than promotional, in tone.  They should be written from the communitys point of view (third person: They rather than we or I).  This means that business pages, like every other page around here, will retain history documenting the business, the location, events, and all sorts of connections within the community.  Deleting information, unless its outright wrong, is frowned upon.  Likewise for photos  theyre a part of that history!
 1. Try to respond positively to negative comments.  People will inevitably leave negative reviews sooner or later.  Look around at any business page on the wiki; theyve all got them.  Dont delete themit can look like youre trying to cover something up.  Just take a deep breath and remember that customers sometimes forget that business owners have feelings and write things theyd never be willing to say in person.  Try to address the problems they raise in a friendly, constructive way.  This is your chance to demonstrate your great customer service to every single person who reads the wiki page.
 For example:
   After a couple of reviewers complained of an increase in co pays at Dagon H.C. Jones, DDS, Dr. Jones did a great job of http://daviswiki.org/Dagon_H.C._Jones%2C_DDS?actiondiff&version296&version195 explaining here why some people experienced the increase and why it was necessary.
   Stylist David Martin made a very concise, polite offer to either refund or fix a clients complaints http://daviswiki.org/David_Martin?actiondiff&version2170&version1169 here.
   A good explanation and demonstration of flexibility in resolving the situation, like the one Users/Aaron.Curtin Aaron Curtin offered http://daviswiki.org/APEX_Cycles_%26_Service?actiondiff&version2188&version1186 here, can go a long way.
   B. Brazill responded http://daviswiki.org/El_Macero_Pharmacy?actiondiff&version241&version140 here to a complaint with a very nice apology and reviewed store policy with associates to prevent a recurrence of the problem at El Macero Pharmacy.
   Andy Henderson left a fantastic explanation on Dimple Records coupled with a description of who to contact with complaints if the customer still wasnt satisfied and wanted to formally complain.  Read it http://daviswiki.org/Dimple_Records?actiondiff&version266&version165 here.

 I need help / Somethings incorrect! 
First read and understand the three points at the top of this page.

If somethings incorrect, you can fix it!  If you think people might have questions or not understand, use the edit comment bar at the bottom of the editing window to explain (theres a short character limit, so keep youll have to keep it brief).  Beyond that, you can easily ask for help from other editors by creating a Talk page (its easy  details on the Wiki Community/Seeking Help Seeking Help page).

 Conflicts 
If you run into disagreements with other editors, look to the advice on the Wiki Community/Handling Problems handling problems page.

 Handy Links 
There are a number of issues that come up here on the Wiki because of its unique culture as a part of the Davis community, rather than a listing website like Yelp.  There are also a lot of great ways you can contribute!  Here are some links that might come in handy:

  Importance of using your RealName and Identity.  These issues come up a lot, both with business representatives and anonymous critics.  Give em a look.
  Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions Nonprofit Restrictions  the Wiki is part of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, and is actually prohibited from promoting (or being used to promote) forprofit businesses.  Hence the informational tone mentioned in Point 2 above.
  Wiki Community  this page is kind of a hub for discussion about various Wiki issues and goingson.
  Consider sharing your expertise and passion!  Dental Questions and Garden Questions are places where the community can interact with the local professionals in the field.  If your business gives you expertese on a certain subject, consider starting a similar service here on the wiki.
  The wiki is a great place to explain policies that customers may be unfamiliar with.  See the restaurant guide and tipping pages for great information on common issues from the industry perspective.
