From people hawking wares at the Farmers Market to large corporate stores and back to people with Green and Local Gift Ideas ideas for green and local gifts, Davis is home to a large number of businesses.  Since there are so many different flavors, here are several different ways to browse the goods and services available for sale in our fine town. The Business Showdown is yet another way to compare businesses by comparing similar businesses head to head.

And dont forget to check Arriving Businesses businesses that are just newly arriving, or Departed Businesses businesses that once existed, but are now departed. You may also want to save some money, and check out some cheap food, some Discounts and Freebies discounts and freebies (of food), or even take part in the thriving free economy of Davis. Or if you want to know where you can get something to eat really early or really late, check out breakfast and night time.
