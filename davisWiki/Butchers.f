A butcher butches.  Or rather, they cut meat for your consumption.  Most supermarkets have butchers in them, and you can find some specialized butchers in the area.


In a category by itself is the Meat Lab on campus.  They provide inexpensive and excellent cuts of meat and prepared meats.




Outside of Davis, especially notable sources for meat include the El Torito Meat Market up in Woodland.
