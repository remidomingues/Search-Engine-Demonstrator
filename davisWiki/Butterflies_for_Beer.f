Since 1977, Professor Arthur Shapiro has held an annual contest to catch a particular Butterflies & Moths butterfly species. He awards a pitcher of beer to the first person who captures a live cabbage butterfly, http://butterfly.ucdavis.edu/butterfly/Pieris/rapae Pieris rapae, after Jan. 1 each year. The butterfly usually is the first kind to emerge after metamorphosis in spring. Shapiro runs the contest to make sure heÂ’s doing his job monitoring the insect. Few beat him to the punch.

 Contest Coverage 

  The suspense fluttered to an end on Jan. 26 2006 when entomologist Art Shapiro captured the first cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) of the year in West Sacramento, Yolo County. He gets to buy himself a pitcher of beer for the 28th out of 34 yearsthat is the deal hes made with himself. I arrived at 1 p.m. sharp, saw the bug coming straight at me and got it on the first swing at 1:06 p.m., and the rest, as they say, is history.
