The Food









20130423 22:04:45 nbsp Im Parvanehs husband and as you might expect I eat her cookies, pies, cakes, and brownies every day.  Theyre delicious, but more than that they are really healthy.  Parvaneh uses applesauce in place of oil or margarine and  instead of refined sugar she uses coconut sugar or agave nectar.  Shell work a recipe over and over until she can achieve, say, a creamy texture to brownies without using oil.  I could go on extolling the virtues of my wifes healthy baking but as they say the proof is in the pudding.  Im six foot one and weigh 170 pounds.  Pretty good for someone who is a baking company test subject! Users/AlexGray

20130427 19:27:41 nbsp Parvanehs baked items are scrumptious and healthy.  She is very innovative.  She makes these raw cookies with dates, nuts, and natural flavors such as saffron, ginger, etc.  They are so good and addictive!  Her healthy Nutella (hazelnut chocolate) is so delicious I can eat the whole jar in a day.  I have also tasted her brownie.  I had not been a fan of brownie till I tasted hers.  It was excellent, and she made it with all natural ingredients.  There are no chemicals, additives, white sugar, oil, etc. in her baked goods.  Not only are they guilt free but taste awesome!  I also highly recommend her home cooked meals.  She uses fresh ingredients and customizes her food to your taste.

20131031 16:48:13 nbsp We are so lucky to have Parvaneh cooking for us! Its been a year now that I placed a small ad at the Davis CoOp for someone to help me and my husband eat healthy foods. We are both busy and I hate to cook. So a lovely young woman answered the ad and the rest is delicious! I have a long list of Favorite dishes in every category. The BEST include Stuffed Bell Peppers, Lasagna w/ Roast Cauliflower, Risotta, Spinach with/without glutenfree pasta, Classic Black Bean & Veggie Chili with Corn Bread, Buttermilk and Coconut Rice.  She cooks vegetarian rather than vegan for us and spent several weeks recently cooking glutenfree. All her salads and dressings are great and some of the desserts we love are Carrot & Ginger Cake with Cashew Frosting, Blackstrap Ginger Snaps, Espresso Oatmeal Cookies (great!) and any of her fruit pies (glutenfree, too). It looks like they dont allow me to upload photos or Id show you the osonice Christmas gift box she surprised us with last year. I am so delighted that Parvaneh has taken this entrepreneurial path. Its an honor to know such a talented, hardworking and courageous person. ~Christine Golden, Woodland CA Users/ChristineLGolden
