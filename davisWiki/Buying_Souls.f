 Soul Buying, Generally 

The practice of buying and/or selling souls was once rampant in Davis.  Everyone has at least one weakness.  The point of the game is to find a weakness and use it to buy/barter for their wiki:WikiPedia:Souls soul.

For example, Users/RevChad person x is Starbucks frappuchinos slave.  We take a frappuchino, wave it in their face, and trade it for their soul.  Simple?  Not quite.  But it is amusing when you do succeed.

 Davis Soul Buying Experiences 

I bought two souls while in high school.  One for two pieces of lined paper, another for a single piece of graph paper.  The former was a rather attractive semigothic girl, the latter was a Jewish lad who claimed he didnt believe in souls and therefore laughed at my foolish attempt to buy nothing  shortly however he began to get nervious and tried to barter for it back which I found quite amusing.  He got really uneasy when he tried to buy mine and I responded with, What, you think Im an idiot?!  Users/KrisFricke

A guy I knew in highschool had a huge collection of souls.  Once he had one, he never, ever, ever gave it back... LizaAbeja and I were discussing this the other dayshe knew someone who bought peoples souls, too.  I guess its pretty common, especially among the heathens (such as ourselves). Users/SummerSong

I once went to a party dressed as satan. I had a samsonite breifcase full of Sierra Nevada Summerfest which I sold for souls. Users/ArlenAbraham

I went as Lucifer the Fallen for halloween in 2000, and I carried around a contract for people to sign in red ink. My roommate at the time thought it was predisposing people to selling their souls for real. He had mercury poisoning. Users/KarlMogel

i am the proud owner of 13 and 1/3 souls, almost all catholic. Users/AdamYergovich

In high school I sold my souls left arm for a pack of gum.  Will be rather interesting to explain to my fellow dead people if the whole soul thing actually turns out to be true. Users/ZacMorris

I am the proud owner of wiki citizen Users/JohnDudeks soul.  I bought it 2nd hand during Geometry in Jr. High.  My 2nd aquisition happened in 11th grade for the price of a ring.  No, I am neither married nor engaged, she just liked a ring Id bought.  users/MasonMurray

The Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion is rumored to have run a soulbuying operation openly at a table on the Quad in broad daylight on Halloween 2003.  Users/BarnabasTruman
