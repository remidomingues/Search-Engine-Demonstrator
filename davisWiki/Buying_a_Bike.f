 Places to find used bikes 

The Bike Auction is another way to obtain a bike. You may want to head over to the The Bike People Davis Bike Collective after you buy an auction bike, or if you just want to put one together for yourself.  Pretty much all of the bicycle shops in town will do repairs for you.  APEX Cycles & Service and the Davis Bike Exchange sell used bikes already cleaned up.  If you want to browse the internet, theres always Craigslist, which has a http://sacramento.craigslist.org/search/bik?queryDavis&minAskmin&maxAskmax forum for bikes for sale. See also Bike People and Green Bicycle Depot. Bike Forth usually has the parts necessary to rebuild an old bike.
