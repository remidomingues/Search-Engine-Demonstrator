For those of you considering a residential project, Steve recommends this video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v7xaNagtPQc&featureplayer_embedded Smart Design For Hot/Humid Climates,  prepared by Barley & Pfeiffer Architects in Austin, Texas to help understand practical ways to improve the efficiency of your home.

For contractors, Steve is a member of the Lean Construction Institute and recognizes the importance of timely accurate communication to keep jobs moving.  Preconstruction plan review identifies ambiguities and errors before they become issues in the field.

For facility owners, if you dont have a competent facilities person on staff, Steve can provide owners representation and preconstruction services to see that the project stays on track.
