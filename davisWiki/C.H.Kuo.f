Describe Users/C.H.Kuo here.


C.H.Kuo is a sockpuppet account that used the same IP address as Users/foodexpert and Users/wikiwikiYEAAH to comment on The Old Teahouse.

According to wikiwikiYEAAHs comment on OTH, C.H.Kuo is their friend hence the shared IPs, but considering the record of Users/ilikebeer several Users/abcdefghilikefood other sockpuppets by this IP address, that story is rather doubtful.

C.H.Kuo may be the actual person behind the other sockpuppets, considering that there is a UC Davis freshman with the same initials and last name listed within the UC Davis people search. However, Users/MaxMikalonis this editor cannot determine whether the utilized IP address is from within the dorms or not.



20080520 16:42:01 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName. Leaving comments under different names to make it appear as though your opinion is shared by many people is called Sockpuppeting and is considered to be in poor taste. Additionally, this is the 5th account to use your IP address, and because of the sockpuppeting your potentially legitimate concerns are not being listened to. If there are issues with these restaurants, my best advice to you would be to create a single account under your real name and use that from now on. Users/MaxMikalonis

20080520 17:31:53 nbsp 67.161.191.45, the only IP address this account has used so far, is a comcast IP address. That being said, about one in ten freshmen dont live in the dorms. Users/WilliamLewis
