The Community Alliance with Family Farmers is a statewide NonProfit Organizations nonprofit that started in Davis in http://caff.org/join/history.shtml 1978 as a result of student and community action against the University of California. Then known as CAAP, the group filed a landmark suit against the UC for using taxpayer dollars in the creation of technologies that benefit large farms, and hurt small farms and farm workers.FootNote(Known as the Research Priorities (or Tomato Harvester or Mechanization) Lawsuit) One outcome of the suit was the creation of the Small farm center

For more than 30 years, CAFF has worked to build a movement of rural and urban people to foster familyscale agriculture that cares for the land, sustains local economies and promotes social justice. Strong partnerships exist between family farmers and their communities. CAFF strives to build on shared values around food and agriculture, and work together in practical, ontheground programs. These partnerships create locally based economic vitality, improved human and environmental health, and longterm sustainability of family farms.



 Projects 

 Buy Fresh, Buy Local campaign 
The http://caff.org/programs/buylocal.shtml Buy Fresh, Buy Local campaign encourages Davis consumers to think locally when purchasing their food. By buying directly from local farms whenever you can, you can have a real impact on preserving farmland and keeping farmers on their land.

 Five reasons to Buy Local 

    Local produce tastes better and itâ€™s better for you.       A recent study showed that fresh produce loses nutrients quickly. Food grown in your own community was probably picked within the past day or two. It is crisp, sweet and loaded with flavor.

    Local food supports local farm families.       Local farmers who sell directly to consumers cut out the many middlemen and get full retail price for their food  which means farm families can afford to stay on the farm, doing the work they love.

   Local food protects genetic diversity.       In the modern industrial agriculture system, shippers demand produce that can survive packing, transport, and a long shelf life in the store. In contrast, local farmers that sell direct to you grow a huge number of varieties selected because they have the best flavors, provide a long harvest season, and come in an array of eyecatching colors.

  Local food preserves open space, and supports a clean environment.       As the value of directmarketed fruits and vegetables increases, selling farmland for development becomes less likely. When you buy locally grown food, you are doing something proactive about preserving the agricultural landscape.

   Local food is about the future.       By supporting local farmers today, you can help ensure that there will be farms in your community tomorrow, and that future generations will have access to nourishing, flavorful and abundant food.

Getting the chemicals out of cotton
Cotton is one of the most pesticideintensive crops in the world. CAFF works with cotton farmers in the San Joaquin Valley to reduce their pesticide use in their cotton production. The http://caff.org/programs/farmscaping/sust_cotton.shtml Sustainable Cotton Project has also worked the develop a market for organic and pesticidereduced cotton in the apparel industry.

 Hedgerows and wildlife habitat 
http://caff.org/programs/farmscaping/hedgerowin.shtml Wildlife habitat on Farms is important to a wholefarm system. Habitat plantings, such as hedgerows, are also important in reducing erosion and water pollution. The Farmscaping project works with farmers to install hedgerows and other wildlife habitat on farms.


 Pesticide Reduction 
http://caff.org/programs/bios.shtml Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems, or BIOS, is a revolutionary technical assistance program launched by CAFF that demonstrates farms can reduce their pesticide use and remain viable. Since the founding of BIOS in 1993, similar initiatives have begun through the University of California in grapes, cotton, row crops, prunes, and citrus.

 Policy Work 
CAFF also works in statelevel and local http://caff.org/policy/tracking.shtml policy advocacy on issues of food & farming, including food safety, GMOs, FarmtoSchool, global warming, and farm labor.
