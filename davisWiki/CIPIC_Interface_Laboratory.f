The CIPIC Interface Laboratory is a multidisciplinary research laboratory that brings together experts from different areas of engineering, signal processing and psychophysics. The research activities at the laboratory are concerned with human perception and its role in the interface between humans and machines. Our work focuses on spatial hearing and threedimensional sound synthesis, with related activities in image perception, and in speech, audio, and image signal processing.

In technical terms, our ultimate goal is to investigate and exploit the complex cues that contribute to the human experience of immersion in spatial sound. To this end, we use physicallybased structural models and motionsensitive methods for sound capture to produce highperformance and effective spatial auditory interfaces.

The CIPIC Interface Laboratory was originally formed in the Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing. It now reports administratively to IDAV  the Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization  but retains its original name.
