     This question is for the wiki Users/TomGarberson My edit to the last comment on Christine Chao OD  doesnt have the date and time.  How do I add this?  I thought it was automatically added.  Thanks for your help!  Users/CJJChao
      The date and time are added when you submit a comment using the little comment bar (which you can see up at the top of this page.  If you edit the page and directly, they arent added automatically.  Honestly, they arent really necessary most of the time.  Its easy enough to add the information in if you want, though.
