Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology (aka CLIMB) is a oneyear research program open to all undergraduates majoring in mathematics, statistics, or one of the biological sciences.  It is designed to train motivated juniors (you apply as a sophomore ideally, but they dont automatically rule out people who are going to be seniors) in the interdisciplinary study of mathematics and biology.  Mathematical biology has increased in popularity over the past several years.  Quantitative tools are absolutely necessary in the study of almost all biological questions these days.  CLIMB, although fairly new, is becoming wellknown for their high pay, almost $15 an hour, higher than any other undergraduate job on campus. This program is very related to the Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics minor.

Program Expectations

 1. Taking a 4 unit course in fall or spring: BIS 132 or MAT 124.
 1. Taking a 3 unit seminar every quarter of the academic year, where one sees the topics out there in the form of faculty research presentations, works on small scale projects with other CLIMB members, and begins to develop a problem to work on for summer research.
 1. Full time summer research for 10 weeks (40 hours per week).

Application Requirements

 1. 3.0 or higher GPA.
 1. Major in Biological or Mathematical Sciences. (This can be fudged a little, i.e. major in statistics or physics, but you will need to consult with Carole.)
 1. At least one year of calculus.
 1. Agreeing to complete Program Expectations.
 1. Life sciences majors must have completed at least two courses in biology.
 1. Mathematical sciences majors must have completed at least two mathematics courses beyond calculus and also at least one course in biology.

Past and Present Cohort Research Projects
  20072008 Cohort  understanding avian influenza spread on a network of farms, taking into account the internal disease dynamics of each farm.
  20062007 Cohort   understanding the persistence and dynamics of an endemic vernal pool plant species using a metapopulation framework.  Here we developed our own mathematical model, analyzed it, and used computer programming to simulate the population dynamics for plants in complicated landscapes. In the simulations we found that a few large pools increases persistence as opposed to many small pools.


Call for math majors
Rumor has it, CLIMB needs more math majors to apply!
