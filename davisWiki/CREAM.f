20131009 22:53:34 nbsp Delicious and not over priced.  Works for me. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20131010 09:02:18 nbsp I went here last night and I must say I like them very much.  Good chocolate chip cookies, very nice prices, a real bargain in fact. I tried the coffee cookie but was not impressed.  I get chocolate chip cookies with cookies and cream ice cream, it is the perfect combination Users/DagonJones

20131019 05:39:25 nbsp I liked the ice cream but was not particularly impressed by the cookies. They seemed about on par with the ones you can get at Subway. Overall, its a cool idea at a fair price, but a bit overhyped.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20131019 12:39:05 nbsp I went to cream, or as I like to call it the the cookie trap downtown and tried the bare bones chocolate on vanilla. Its good, and warm, and I perceive an okay price point (especially with cash)

I then hit it up again and got kinda zany white chocolate macadamia nut and the royal caramel ice cream, and its super good... Slogged thru a fat chunk of caramel and it was great. They only have Vanilla flavored milk? What kind of cookie shop doesnt carry straight milk??? Users/StevenDaubert

20131109 00:32:37 nbsp Ok, so I went here the other night, got an ice cream sandwich and paid with a credit card.  Then tonight a receipt popped up on my phone via email.  I was a little confused, because I didnt remember giving them my email address, so I opened up the email contact they had listed for me and it showed my home and work addresses from about, 2005 plus home and work phone numbers from about the same time, along with my email address.  So given that, it kind of looks like they used the name on my credit card info, Google searched a bunch of my personal info, and put all of it (fortunately mostly outdated) into thier database.  Are other people getting this too? Users/jefftolentino

20131117 17:38:57 nbsp We were excited by the idea of an ice cream sandwich shop and we wanted to try them as soon as this place opened!  Then day after day we saw the perpetual line extending a city block out the door we decided to wait a while and let the crowds die down before trying to come back again.  Finally, the sidewalk in front of the business was bare and we walked in.  It seemed like a bare bones shop with no frills and my eyes scoured the store find more things to contemplate, but there were few.  Theres ice cream in the freezer/counter and cookies on metal racks behind the counter.

We each picked two cookie types and one ice cream flavor.  I was asked if I wanted my cookies warmed up and I said yes.  We each paid the VERY reasonable cash price of $2.50 for a sizable ice cream sandwich.  I feel like a similar item at Sugar Daddies or Baskin Robbins would probably run $2 more.  We walked out of the store and tasted our sandwiches and the conversation turned to our flavor choices and how amazingly delicious the treat was!  I dont know if it was my amazing talent at picking flavor combinations or the amazingly high quality and tasty product, but I was doing all I could to not eat the wrapper after my sandwich was gone.  I will definitely be returning.  It was worth the wait. Users/JSilva

20140625 01:23:23 nbsp Honestly, this place overwhelmed me so much the first time I walked in (mostly buzzed, I will admit)I couldnt actually make a decision and left emptyhanded. However, the second time I was sober and able to finally make a decision. Honestly, the size of the ice cream sandwich was a little overwhelming for me, and I am a dessert maven! I am interested in trying the half sandwich, but I forgot to ask what that entails. Is it an open face sandwich or do they slice it in half? I guess Ill find out the next time I go in because there definitely will be a next time!  Users/ArianeMetz
