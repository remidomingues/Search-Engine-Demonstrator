20081029 16:39:10 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Programs and Welcome to the Wiki!  My names Evan, pleased to meet you! You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  Its also looks like you are taking credit for all the work anybody does for Campus Union Programs, and all you do is CUP.  Id imagine (hope!) you have a life outside of it.    Thanks for updating some of the program entries... what else do you like in Davis? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
