CVS/pharmacy is a good place to get medicine cheaper than at a grocery store.  Some Medical Services insurance plans let you use the CVS Pharmacies pharmacies to refill medications.  Both locations sell quite a few items other than medical supplies with no discernible unifying theme: small clothing stores clothing items such as underwear and socks, nonperishable food, cows milk, frozen convenience food, seasonal items (Halloween stuff, Summer recreation items), small electronics, batteries, cosmetics, kitchen items, office supplies, cleaning supplies, light furniture, and more. The selection of everything is limited and tends towards lowpriced items with some privatelabel brands.

The CVS ExtraCare card is a rewards card that gives you sales prices. On some specially advertised items you can get ExtraCare bucks which are like coupons for about $1 or more off your next purchase. The ExtraCare bucks print out on your receipt.

CVS also develops Photography film. They no longer have 1 hour film developing. Film is sent away to be processed and takes about a week to be processed. They used to have (1 hour and overnight). They also used to process passport photos with a onehour turnaround ($8.99 for the first pair; $1.99 for each additional pair).  They used to stop their film processing at 8PM, so you had to drop it off before that time if you wanted it done that evening. At the 24hour store (West Covell), 1hour photo orders were not processed overnight, but were processed first thing the next morning when the lab reopens.

Passport Photos
Both locations still do passport photos (as of December 2013). The current prices are $11.99 for a pair, but there is a coupon offered on their website that gives $2 off (valid until 12/31/2013). See http://www.cvsphoto.com/passportphotos


They also duplicate keys.

The Oak Tree Plaza location is a little bigger. It has a larger selection of nonmedical items and also had the first Wellness Express Clinic inside (before the company went under), next to the pharmacy, where you could get routine examinations and take care of minor medical issues.

They offer a AAA discount at the pharmacy at both locations, and accept many counteroffer competitor offers from other drug stores. The AAA discount is also found at most major pharmacies. The amount of the discount will not be known until they actually process and fill your prescription.

Each CVS store sells Postage stamps  only in books of 20 stamps

CVS began installing Chase ATMs in their stores in August of 2009. There are Chase ATMs at both CVS locations. These ATMs are actually operated by Cardtronics. Chase pays Cardtronics to maintain the ATMs and also to add the Chase brand name to the ATMs. These ATMs are also part of the Allpoint ATM Network. If your bank or credit union is a member of Allpoint, you can use these ATMs feefree.

Both CVS locations offer video stores video rental through Redbox kiosks.

Their carts have also been known to Wandering Carts wander.

CVS/pharmacy features CVS in capital letters with a slash and lowercase pharmacy. Computer programmers know the significance of the capital letters and the slash.

 History 


During August 2008, the Walnut Creek based Longs was purchased by CVS Pharmacy.  As part of the purchase, they announced that all Longs Drugs would be renamed and rebranded as CVS except for the stores in Hawaii.  The CVS name has been applied to both former Longs locations in Davis as of August 2009.


The last 5 times I have gone here (The Marketplace location) they were unable to develop onehour film.  Their machines always seem to be broken and they are always backed up.  I would advise going elsewhere, but sadly theres not a lot of photography photo places to choose from here. Users/PhilipNeustrom

I work at the Longs in East Davis, near the Nugget. Just a warning, we are no longer 24 hours due to personnel disputes, but all our other functions run the same schedule. Unlike the Longs mentioned above, our machines have been out once since I started working there and our processors are amazing. I highly recommend it. As a photographer, that where I develop my film, even before I got the discount Users/JohnNash
 No longer 24 hours? Well, that just removed my only reason for going there. Users/MattCzarnowski MC

David Provost suggested stealing a plant from Longs. What an idiot. Users/JohnDudek
 Speaking of plants, Longs has good deals on common garden plants, although I cant vouch for quality. I usually buy at the Red Barn Nursery because good advice comes free with the plant.Users/TomHinds

The pharmacy (Oak Tree Plaza) is the busiest in the entire region, a good time to go is before 4pm or after 7pm since the general working crowd swings through at that time. Also, being as busy as they are, patience is important in order to get good service (if youre nice theyll help as much as they can (they get stressed out too)). The same store also sells stamps Users/BryonWright

Is it just me, or does everyone that works at Longs looks suicidal? I mean, Ive been there at least 10 times last year, and every time Ive seen an increasingly miserable person. Im speaking of the North Davis one, by the way. I cant be the only one noticing this, am I? Users/AtyNguyen
 Its the lighting...Users/BenLee

 We are suicidal...Users/thelonepiper555


I think Rite Aid has a better and more consistent beauty/personal care selection than Longs. I must say, though, it is nice to get some less mainstream items there, like Burts Bees, that Rite Aid does not carry. Longs pharmacy, though, is very good and the pharmacists there have been extremely helpful and nice to me. Users/ArielaHaro

20071028 23:06:47 nbsp I do not suggest buying bike lights there because they are really expensive. They seem like the average longs apart from that. I suggest going there after 5 to ship off stuff for the next days mail.  Users/AnnaF

20071031 09:52:30 nbsp The Longs in E. Davis is always a nightmare. The people at the pharmacy are slow and inefficient, and seem lazy and uninterested. If I owned that place, I would be appalled at the indifference and lightlymasked rudeness that their staff shows their customers. Ive decided to switch to another pharmacy. F#$% those guys. Users/AthenaGlaukopis

20071219 21:25:28 nbsp I work here. The nightshift is the best. Users/thelonepiper555

20080203 19:47:51 nbsp Every time I go to the Longs in the marketplace to pick up a prescription called in by the doctor, it takes a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour (on top of the half hour since the prescription was called in) to get it filled.  Add this to the 1520 minute wait time standing in line (twice since you have to find out that it’s not ready and wait) and the time gets very long, especially if you are waiting with a sick child.  I have NEVER been in and picked up my prescription, ready, at the counter.  This week, I decided to wait a few hours at home with my sick child to avoid the ubiquitous hour wait in the pharmacy.  So I arrive several hours after the prescription is called in, wait in line for 20 minutes, only to find out that my prescription isn’t ready because they’ve run out of the drug!  The pharmacist, after some thought, tells me we can either wait two days or she can call the other Longs to see if they have it.  Waiting is not an option, so I tell her to call. 20 minutes later, she comes back and tells me they do have it at the other Longs and she assures me several times that it will be ready when I get there.  So my sick child and I troop over to the Longs in Oak Plaza and wait there 20 minutes in line only to find out, you guessed it, that it’s NOT ready and it will be “around 10 minutes” plus another 20 minute wait in line.  Well, I’ve had it with Longs.  This is the worst service I have EVER seen with a pharmacy.  Repeatedly.  If there were more than three pharmacies in town, I’m pretty sure they couldn’t get away with consistently poor service. Users/LizSweet

20080204 17:24:55 nbsp LizSweet
i understand that you are pissed off that your kid is sick and cant get your meds. but speaking from experience, the pharmacy fills prescriptions in the order in which they arrive. if you want them to do it faster, you need to call in and let them know so they can speed you to the front of the line. otherwise, they do the ones that patients request first, then do the rest later by order. you cant just expect the doctor to fax something over and just have it filled right away. there are other people who need their medications too. Users/voiceofreason

20080227 18:51:36 nbsp Recently I picked up a 24 pack of bottled water worth $6 at the North Davis location and waited in line to pay.  When it was my turn the checker scanned the case and a price of 69 cents showed up.  I jokingly said hey, ill pay that price instead if you want.  I figured the checker would laugh at my stupid remark, find the manager and fix the error.  Instead the checker essentially had a screw it mentality and just gave me the entire case of water for 69 cents.  Lol, now I like Longs more than Rite Aid. Users/PatrickSing

20080227 19:42:27 nbsp It would appear they stopped selling compressed air cause kids would steal and huff it... Users/StevenDaubert

20080403 19:29:29 nbsp The East Davis (Oak Tree Plaza) Longs has a useless pharmacy department.  I just got back from a 3rd trip there trying to get a prescription filled.  When they need the docs permission for a refill and its delayed, they dont bother to call the customer nor the doc...they let the customer repeatedly come in to find the same excuse: the doctor didnt respond.  This in spite of the doctors assurance that they did.  Ill never use those indifferent cretins again. Users/RalphFinch

20080415 15:56:27 nbsp Dont give the pharmacy techs a hard time. Thats my job! Users/thelonepiper555

20080427 01:43:51 nbsp I recently got my photos developed here at the 1550 Covell location (next to Nugget), and was pretty satisfied. I saved my photos on a thumb drive and brought it in to upload, and it only took about half an hour to get them developed. If you live in South Davis, I would NOT recommend going to Rite Aid (near Safeway) to develop your pictures, as the photo machine is ancient and may freeze or crash. Users/at86

20080602 11:55:39 nbsp DO NOT   get your prescriptions here!!!  I had a very important prescription for my daughter and they told me it would take some time to fax over a paper to my insurance for the approval but they told me to wait.  I called in 3 TIMES to have that fax sent in so it took more than 2 weeks for them to finally give me my prescription.  They never call me to inform me they havent received it, they never called me to tell me that they finally did get it in.  I have to do all the work.  Finally when one of the ladies was VERY RUDE to me I decided to leave.  Take into consideration all the times I was waiting at the store when they told me my prescription was ready (I called in) I get there and they told me to wait an hour with a tired infant with me.

Dont develop your film here!!!  They take more time than they say they will and they overcharged me as well.  One time I asked for a white border in huge letters where they told me to write it in and I didnt get that, they told me to just pay for it nothng they can do.

SO NEVER GET PRESCRIPTION AND FILM HERE :) Users/Marcie

20080814 17:01:16 nbsp I have only good things to say about the pharmacy staff at the West Davis Longs. Im in regularly to pick up prescriptions and from time to time my doctors office will obliviously send the refills to the other Longs pharmacy. The pharmacy staff have always been gracious about transferring the prescription, even though the process seems to be kind of a pain for them. Users/LizPhillips

20081202 01:12:53 nbsp After much aggravation with the Longs website and trying to upload pictures to have them printed, I called the Marketplace location store and asked if they had a kiosk I could use a flash drive with instead, and the staff member who answered was helpful and straightforward. I hurried over, and it turns out there are THREE hp photo printing kiosks! It was 29¢ for each 4x6 print, but the process was pretty simple and quick, and definitely better than trying to do it online. So glad about this because I was trying to print a copy of my passport photo for an education abroad application and just met the deadline! Users/AmyChow

20090310 01:27:32 nbsp I used Longs at the Marketplace for passport photos. I got 14 (which was necessary for a study abroad program) and it set me back about $20, which isunfortunatelythe most reasonable price in Davis, I believe; theyre such small pictures. The pictures were processed when I came back two and a half hours later and they all processed well; I even look semiphotogenic, for once. Overall, a satisfying experience.  Users/warriorvoyager

20090506 16:38:30 nbsp DO not get prescriptions here (Oak Tree Plaza)! Their callin machine always hangs up one me right after I specify the time I want to pick it up, always! I have told them about this problem twice already, and though the first employee was helpful the second lady did not even seem to care. She told me, That is just how the system is. Wow okay...After trying to get my prescription refilled 5 times, I went in only to find out they were completely out and it would take 2 days. Finally they called the other Longs and I went over there to get it.

Honestly,the last time I talked to this lady she was so rude and uncaring that I switched my prescription to Rite Aid. She didnt even care that the phone system didnt work, and I basically had to push her into even calling the other Longs.

Avoid this pharmacy! Users/sgent

20090517 08:59:17 nbsp I am on the management team of the West Covell Store (near Panda Express & Safeway) and would like to add that our photo processing has been up, for some time Longs has been using the HP prints in seconds kiosks (prints while you wait, no tech needed), we also recieved a new Pharmacy Manager, and have an amazing Lead Pharmacy Tech, so our pharmacy staff is at its best with its staff happy with their supervision and management.

Also keep in mind our pharmacy is now open from 8a9p during the week and 8a5p on saturday and sunday. We began opening an hour earlier about a month ago to suite our customers needs. Feel free to to progress your script(s) as early and quickly as possible to avoid having to wait at the pharmacy, end up being transferred, or waiting on a drug order. The faster you can fulfill your consumer duties, the faster we can keep our customers and patients happy!

After the CVS/Pharmacy changeover completes our photo equipment will change to Kodak  and the machinery is so new that its still being made! and these kiosks (to replace the HP kiosks) will also be full service, which means different finishes, different photo sizes, even passports! we will also continue to have a wet lab (a photo tech) to assist our community with the product questions and photo needs.

Welcome to the wiki boka  Users/StevenDaubert

20090603 12:12:32 nbsp My opinion is: DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS PHARMACY (lest they patronize you) (the Market Place one that is). The techs are generally friendly and helpful, however, overall, this pharmacy makes FEMA look competent and efficient. Other descriptors that come to mind are: officious, disrespectful, clumsy, bumbling and unapologetic. Details below. I imagine that some of the fumbling, ball dropping and long waits have to do with the new system and the change over to CVS. I could excuse some delays and mistakes and suchlike, its the attitude that gets my goat.

Here is my tail of woe and intrigue: doctor calls in a prescription (for an acutely ill person who needs it right away). I arrive at the pharmacy the next day and am told the prescription does not exist (Strike 1). This, of course, was on a Saturday. I manage to reach the doctor and have him recall the prescription in. I arrive at the pharmacy where I am told they do not have the right dose of pill. I am given a convoluted and generally inscrutable explanation of what they can do for me, which I understand to be give me an equivalent dose consisting of smaller dose pills and then obtain the correct dose pill on Monday. Moreover they offer to advance us these pills to get us through the weekend (i.e. no immediate charge) (Partial restitution of Strike 1). Monday I arrive again at the CVS/Longs Market Place pharmacy counter (on West CAHvuhl as their recording states). I am given the full prescription (for which I pay $65) of the wrong dose pills, which unfortunately I do not realize until after I have relinquished my place in line. So after a second long wait, I inquire why I did not get the correct dose. The pharmacist (Philippe Demayer, I believe) informs me that he converted the prescription to a different dose pill and cannot now give me the correct dose pills. He suggests that this is rational because if the patient was used to taking 24 of the lower dose pills per day and then switched midstream to a mere 6 pills per day, she could inadvertently take 24 of them, overdose and die. There is a certain logic to thisfor people who cant count or read. Neither applied to the patient in question. Philippe also said something to the effect of, we never told you we would get the higher dose pills, and besides, whats the difference, it is just more pills to take, no big deal (of course if you are non compis mentis enough to forget to take 6 rather than 24 pills, how competent are you to count out 24 pills by yourself in the first place). I find Philippe, surprisingly and inexplicably, a tad defensive when questioned and not terribly willing to explain the situation without a vexed and insolent edge on his demeanor (Strike 2). I also ask why the pills are so expensive as they are generic and our insurance should cover them with a small copay. They say that they ran it through insurance and that $65 is the copay. So I go home, disappointed on two counts. Later, just to satisfy my skepticism, I call the insurance company. They assure me that the copay is $9 and that the pharmacy ran the prescription the wrong way, so it was rejected.

Today I go back to the pharmacy to resolve the issue. The tech tries to figure out the problem. After fumbling around for a time, and asking for help from a man who seems to hang around just for such purposes (Steve), he figures out that to rerun the claim with insurance I must be refunded my initial payment, which I graciously accept. Then, after the obligatory interminable wait, the tech tells me they have just rerun the claim and that it still comes out to $65 dollars (Strike 3). I give them the insurance card and ask them to call the provider number on the back. While I am waiting, I call the insurance company again. Incredibly, the insurance person tells me they have STILL not called in or run the claim (they can see this on their computer apparently) and tells me to tell them that their contract with the insurance requires them to call the Provider help number if there is a problem with a claim. I am not sure what Philippe and his minions were doing for the 45 minutes I am sitting there, but it sure as hell wasnt calling the insurance.

Then (the denouement finally), the tech comes back unsmilingly (Philippe apparently will not talk to me any more) and tells me that I am going to have PAY the $65 and then file a grievance with the insurance company (Strike fucking 4). I am seldom rude to anyone, especially service employees, but these pharmaceutical philistines have heaped enough insult onto a gaping injury alreadyso I say very emphatically, NO, you need to figure this out by calling the number on the insurance card, as your contract requires you to do. Two minutes later, the tech brusquely and still unsmilingly hands me the insurance card back and as he quickly turns away blurts out, it is taken care of. He then beats a hasty retreat. I am not sure what this cryptic taken care of means. Perhaps they are simply forgoing the profit because theyd rather be rid of me (because that is how unpleasant I am). Or perhaps it means they called the number finally and discovered the error was theirs but were too proud to apologize (and the waving of the $9 copay was to remunerate me for my troubles and wasted time). In the absence of evidence to the contrary I will go with the latter.

I realize that mine is a data set of N1, however, in my several sojourns to this pharmacy I uncovered anecdotal evidence that my problem was not unique or even particularly unusual. Many people were grumbling and attempting to navigate out of similar SNAFUs. Our doctor tells us that this pharmacy is a problem pharmacy and they do not enjoy dealing with them (again anecdotal, but telling). My opinion is that many of the people who come to a pharmacy are sick or caring for sick people, and are likely distracted and upset. Pharmacies should recognize this and be a little bit more empathetic than the average business. They should explain their procedures and prices clearly and have a tolerance for misunderstandingand be willing to work with their customers to figure out such discrepancies. CVS/Longs, in my experience, does none of this. They seem to me like an impersonal, corporate monolith, and not a people or service oriented provider. That is all the wisdom I got out of this debacle.  FOOTNOTE: today, five days after the its taken care of event, we got a robocall from this pharmacy, letting us know that two prescriptions were in. I called and found that they had a partial and a full of the same medicationand both of the wrong dose!

 Providentially, I had the opportunity to pick up a medication at the Oak Tree CVS/Longs. Fascinating contrast. Many people were suffering the same sort of mix ups and delays as I experienced at the Market Place location, but in this pharmacy they had a fine grasp of basic customer service. During my 30 minute wait, I saw four potentially angry people successfully assuaged and one not so successfully. In one instance, the tech came out from behind the fortress to the waiting area to explain to a waiter in person the prognosis for getting his delayed medication. And I heard the pharmacist telling a disgruntled customer that she had every right to be angry and that they were exceptionally sorry about the problems she was experiencing. Very impressive. Only one mans dudgeon was not to be allayed by the assiduous staff. He declared to no one in particular, repeatingly and loudly, that this was a halfassed pharmacy. His wife told some of us that he had recently suffered a loss, and was out of sortsfor which the dilatory pharmacy provided an expedient scapegoat. Though the line was longer and slower moving than Id have liked and there was, naturally, a glitch over which I had to wait 20 more minutes for resolution, I left feeling fairly and respectfully treated. I sensed not so much incompetence as an ineffective system (perhaps the new CVS system is not operating at peak efficiency yet). So I may continue to go here, rather than the Rite Aid just yet. Users/MichaelPlotkin

20091009 15:41:27 nbsp The pharmacy staff is rude and uninformed.  The pharmacist is incompetent and unprofessional.  They were both more interested in playing the blame game and throwing fits than they were taking responsibility and helping the customer.  Last time I checked, a pharmacy was a dispensary of medication.  A doctor writes the prescription, they fill it.  End of story.  No more fits, please.   Users/MrsC

20100122 23:55:35 nbsp I went to the CVS in the Market Place for the first time today.  I bought 2 boxes of soda, and after the checker scanned them and made my change, she proceeded to leave while another checker took over, she also left the soda on the conveyer belt instead of pushing it down so I could get it without disturbing other customers. Meanwhile, the new checker proceeded to check out the next customer while I got my soda, all in the matter of a minute or so. I feel their customer service here is rather poor. At least push the soda down so I can get out of everyones way! Rude. Users/redbike

20100216 12:30:29 nbsp This pharmacy is incompetent and incredibly rude (@ The Marketplace). They have lost my prescriptions and are VERY unhelpful on numerous occasions. To cite the most recent example, I just got off the phone with an rude woman who kept talking down to me and would not quote me the price of my prescription. I have a very confusing insurance policy and she kept arguing with me about it so I tried to explain it to her but she couldnt understand. Which really didnt matter, anyway, who cares why I want to know, all I wanted to know was the cost of my prescription. Finally after a few minutes of her arguing with me and refusing to tell me the price I said, very nicely I know it seems like I dont have to pay for it, but I do, I know it is very confusing. But either way, could you please just tell me the cost on this? She paused, finally told me and the HUNG UP ON ME. Do not go here.  Users/cori82

20100424 09:14:27 nbsp I would STRONGLY advise AGAINST using the online photo there is just no way that a few photos online should take a week and a half to reach the store, and if it does, it should say so on their site.

20110119 17:05:23 nbsp Their pharmacy has a very unhelpful policy regarding filling a prescription when the pharmacy has less of the medication then needed. My experience has been that a pharmacy will generally honor whatever part of the script they can (even with controlled substances), and then give you something that states the balance remaining, so that you can pick it up when available. At CVS, the policy is (if you dont want to wait until more arrives)that they will fill as much of the prescription as they can, but then the prescription becomes invalidated, meaning that you will need a new prescription from your doctor for however much you didnt get initially.

However, this is store policy and not the law (as they may claim). I consulted a family member who is a doctor, and said that, although this practice is technically legal, the law doesnt required that the pharmacy invalidate your prescription after filling only a portion. I would have called in advance to ask them to order to right amount, but until now I thought you couldnt do it without presenting a script (and also thought they could give it in increments, so it would be pointless) I dont see what the point of this policy is, but having run into it, it is extremely irritating to say the least.
 Users/EricsPseudonym
 The Controlled Substances Act which became effective in 1970 has many restrictions. Certain controlled substances can only be refilled 5 times in 6 months. That means that once the number of refills has been exceeded, by law they cannot refill it any more. Also if the 6 months is over, they cannot refill it. I know it may seem really inconvenient to customers, but it is a law passed by Congress. In addition, sometimes pharmacies do not give you too many of a certain type of drug. The reason is that some drugs are used by people to commit suicide. The pharmacist by various laws and or company rules cannot dispense over a certain number of pills. The reasons they give the customer might seem dishonest, but it is to prevent suicides. Im sorry. Were out of that medication. They cant say, 300 pills would be enough to commit suicide with, so we cant give that out. The limit is to prevent suicide, and they refer the patient to a doctor to get a new prescription so that the patient has a delay before being able to obtain enough pills to commit suicide. A former professor told my class that she had that happen to her once. She was trying to get a bigger amount of pills for a prescription and was about to say I swear Im not going to commit suicide. Give me those extra pills. She figured it out and knew that if she said that the pharmacist would definitely not have dispensed a lethal dose of pills.

 Interesting about the short prescriptions. I picked up what was supposed to be 30 pills from East Covell yesterday (11/3/11). Got home and noticed a partial pill so I poured them out and counted and was short by 45 pills. But they didnt tell me anything and no paperwork indicates the shortage.
  CindiDrake
 I have researched it more and now I have the answer. Schedule II controlled medications are governed by Federal laws. It is not store policy of CVS, but it is a law that applies to all pharmacies in the country. When you have a Schedule II controlled medication and the pharmacy is out of stock, the pharmacy can give you a partial fill of the medication. However, the rest of the pills must be picked up within 72 hours. If you do not pick up the rest of the pills in 72 hours the rest of the pills of the prescription are canceled. The medication cannot be dispensed without a new prescription. With pharmacies, if they are out of stock of the medication and the drug manufacturer cannot send more pills in 72 hours you will end up losing the rest of the pills on your prescription for Schedule II drugs. These rules apply only to Schedule II drugs. The original poster said that a family member who is a doctor told him that it is not necessary to invalidate the rest of the prescription. The doctors answer only applied to drugs that are not Schedule II. For Schedule II drugs, the pharmacy is correct in invalidating the prescription because of the Federal law regarding Schedule II drugs. CVS did not make an error, and was following the law.

With regard to giving out lethal doses of pills, the above speculation may have been filled with a bit too much conspiracy theory. Doctors might limit the quantity of highly addictive or potentially dangerous medication on a prescription. The doctor would indicate to the pharmacist the maximum number of pills to give out to a patient at a time. This is up to a doctor and the pharmacy follows the doctors orders. The pharmacy does not randomly go around and limit the number of your pills just to ruin your day. If you are missing a quantity of pills from your prescription you should call the pharmacy and inform them of this. Tell them politely that the number of pills is incorrect. Pharmacy personnel are human beings and can accidentally count the wrong number of pills. How it works in a pharmacy is that the pharmacist checks the pills by look: color, shape, imprint (letters and identifying numbers on the pill), and form(capsules vs tablets). If the pills all match and are correct, the prescription is given the ok and can be given to a patient. However, once in a while an error in pill counting might result in the wrong number of pills. Often pills are double counted for accuracy. However, there might be an error during the counting of the pills. The drug is correct, but the number of pills is incorrect.

In some cases, pills are packaged in manufacturer stock bottles of 30, 60, or 90 pills and so forth. These stock bottles are simply opened up and poured into the pharmacys brown seethru pill bottles. It is assumed that the drug maker has filled the stock bottles with the correct number of pills. However, drug makers are now using machines to fill their stock bottles. There could be an error in the number of pills.

Tylenol was recalled because machines that packaged the pills accidentally broke pills and these broken pills ended up in other bottles. Stray Vicodin pieces got into Tylenol bottles. There was a recall and Tylenols manufacturing plant was shut down. Crazy pill addict across the country heard about it and went on a wild Easter Egg hunt looking for Tylenol bottles with stray Vicodin pills. These addictive controlled substance pills were highly sought after since they were and are very expensive to buy. Free Vicodin pills were considered a treat to those pill addicts.

20110313 05:59:42 nbsp I feel really bad for the employees at the west location (The Marketplace). Once a cashier myself, i know its difficult dealing with some customers. I was in line and there was a rainbow clothed woman shouting at the cashier about placing a money order that even I didnt know what the hell she wanted. Even the manager didnt seem to know either cause the cashier had to call her cuz the customer kept screaming that the cashier was stupid. Poor cashier managed to keep smiling and being polite. i would have snapped at my age. After the crazy woman left, the girl was still really nice to all of us, even though she looked like she was about to cry. ( Users/JanetthePlanet

20110313 12:56:50 nbsp Not only is the customer service bad at both locations (my opinion) but I hate the way CVS is organized and decorated. It looks so much more junked up than Longs and Rite Aid. I dislike CVS and Rite Aid, but now if I have a choice I just take the lesser of two evils and go to Rite Aid. Users/jsbmeb

20110515 12:04:27 nbsp I dropped off half a roll of film to get developed after experimenting with an old family camera; turns out I had a light leak in the camera so all the pictures were half ruined. The Marketplace CVS tech gave me the prints and negatives for free, which I really appreciate. Kudos! Users/AndrewPotter

20130618 10:37:58 nbsp I have to use CVS because it is a partner with my insurance company for long term refills.  It is my least favorite errand every month.  The pharmacist at CVS is usually helpful, but the staff is often abrupt and not very pleasant.  Whenever there is a glitch with the refill  which shouldnt be hard to fill because it is called in on the automated machine and then I get an automated call when its ready for pick up  the staff is short, sighs, and requires that I wait for them to find it.  Whenever our family has a new prescription, I always go to El Macero Pharmacy.  I cannot say enough about El Macero Pharmacy, which is completely oriented toward customer service and can fill a prescription quickly.   Users/2kids4me

20130820 11:29:27 nbsp I rarely go to CVS, and only go there only if I have to if all other stores are closed since the one in West Covell is open 24 hours. The workers there seem to hate their job and their life. They are monotone, sound dead, and no face expressions at all. Ive tried to smile at them, but they try to avoid eye contact and smiling at all times... The only person who was REALLY helpful and nice was the Asian Indian American Pharmacist in West Covell. He was very nice and he smiled and laughed with me when we couldnt figure something out. Users/JaceWinter

20140411 18:23:43 nbsp The W. Cowell CVS pharmacy is HORRIBLY slow. Usually I have to stand in line for about 30 minutes just to pick up prescriptions that are already ready for pick up. Thats bad enough. Today a lot of customers and I had to wait HOURS! Im so frustrated that Blue Cross has partnered with CVS. Targets pharmacy was much, much better!
