20081024 12:10:26 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Young and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding information to the Biodiesel entry.  I moved it up into the actual entry itself so people reading the entry, looking for a location to find biodiesel could easily find it.  Keep in mind that youre a full editor here on the wiki, and youre not limited to just adding comments.  If you see something that should be rewritten or have information added, please feel free to do so.  Thats how everything on the wiki was written: people just like you or I clicking the Edit icon and then writing it.  Once again, thanks for the info, and welcome to the wiki!
