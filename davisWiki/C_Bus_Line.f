The C Bus Line is a very short Unitrans bus line making a loop from the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal terminal on Campus to the Wake Forest Drive area. It runs about every 30 minutes. It is commonly referred to as The Freshmen Line since it passes through the Cuarto Residence Halls and doesnt really go anywhere else.
