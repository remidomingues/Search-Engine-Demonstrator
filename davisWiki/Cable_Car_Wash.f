$7.00 for outside only, $14.95 for inside/outside car wash. For the interior they vacuum, clean the windows and wipe the dash, and they dont use any harsh chemicals. They also have other services for a few dollars more (e.g., tire dressing, wheel cleaning, vinyl treatment). Detailing services (shampooing, stain removal, hand waxing, buffing, etc) are available by appointment

They close daily for lunch between 1:15 and 2:00 p.m. They also close for inclement weather (rain or threat of rain).
Depending on the time of day, wait can be from 10 minutes to half an hour. Every time you go for a car wash you get a coupon for a buck or two off your next wash (but its within the next month, meaning you probably will end up giving it to a friend).  Only the cashier speaks English, so make sure you talk to him if you have specific concerns about washing your car.

Contrary to what you might expect, they do not wash cable cars.

Contrary to what Comcast customer service told me, they also do not provide cable internet service.

20051002 22:30:36 nbsp by far the worst car washes out of any i have ever taken my car to. extremely dissapointed. ive had 2 dollar mechanical ones that did a better job. Users/ThomasLloyd

20051115 16:22:07 nbsp great car wash  Users/AndrewNewman

20060809 11:11:14 nbsp Decent basic carwash for $6.50. Id go again. Users/JoeCustomer

20060823 12:16:54 nbsp Ive been there several times and never had any complaints way better than any mechanical wash (if 2 dollar ones existed, Im pretty sure they wouldnt even come with a blow dry).  The price and value cant be beat really (have you seen other full service wash prices?).   Users/DeviantDuncan

20070125 15:15:57 nbsp I love Cable Car Wash. Ive taken my cars there many times over the years. I think they tend to do a worse job during their peak times, but thats to be expected. Users/KyleWecker

20070908 10:25:06 nbsp This is a strange little place, where your car gets dried not on the Cable Car property, but on the end of a deadend street. (I guess the neighbors dont complain?)  Anyway, they seem to do about as good a job as any as Ive gotten at similar places, which is to say, I could do a better job myself (Id go after the hardtoget spots, whereas they largely leave them), but it would take a lot longer and be a lot more effort. Users/CovertProfessor

20071214 00:07:20 nbsp paid 17 for inside/outside/waxspray. Its reasonably priced and definitely worth it if youre car is beyond dirty, like leaving your car at UMall at the wrong hours.  Users/KaiWan

20080710 20:39:35 nbsp Does the inside/outside include vacuuming the inside floor and such?  If so, Im going tomorrow! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080828 16:41:49 nbsp this place is great! for $14.95 my car looks amazing. it only took 10 minutes and they have nice little waiting benches to read on. (bring a book or magazine) Users/Lala

20080910 13:43:58 nbsp great job taking the dirt and pollen off car but i was surprised that they couldnt take off bird poop on my hood even though the guy seemed to be scrubbing for some time.  for 7 bux i liked it especially since a million people (exaggeration) are working on your car during the process and i didnt have to get out of the car.   Users/heyitsdimo

20080925 11:47:39 nbsp I was extremely dissapointed with cable car wash. It was my first and only experience. The people working there are extremely rude!! Im hispanic and so is my girlfriend. My girlfriend has the complexion of a white girl though. Blonde hair and blue eyes. The mexicans working there though she didnt know spanish. They said something that pissed me off! In spanish cause i know, but ill translate into english. Oh wow look at that blonde one. Ill do her. They said that just as we were driving by. I dont mind if you make comments but keep them to yourself. Theyre lucky they didnt get an ass beating. My girlfriend told me to let it go and just stay in the car. And sure they do a fast job but the drying sucks! And they didnt even scrub my wheels. Im taking my car to a Shell next time. I dont car if its not hand washed. At least a machine has respect for you. Im not exagerating when I say this is the worst place to wash your car. I would definetly not recomend it! Users/MiguelRamirez


20090803 14:01:04 nbsp These guys are great. In fact, they are almost miracle workers. Im really hard on my car, and have dogs in it a lot, and so when I take it in, it is dusty and dirty and not all that nice. $15, 15 minutes, and the car looks brand new inside! Totally worth it. Users/walkandbike

20090831 16:10:05 nbsp I think it is definitely not a decent Inside/Outside cleaning for $14.99. They do a very clumsy job. My car has still stains and bird poops on it. They are not even using decent cloths to dry, the surface has small particles of cloth dusts.And the guy literally asked me for tip at the end of this service. Users/Amanda09

20091006 14:37:47 nbsp The worst car wash Ive ever been to.  I paid for the middle option (about $20 i think) and it was worse than if I had just gone through one of the mechanical ones.  There were streaks all over the back window and dont think that they vacuumed the back at all.  They say they are Davis only full service car wash but I say Davis doesnt have one. Users/swiftling

20100321 10:43:15 nbsp These guys are OK, but I like the Sundance full service car wash better (if you have time to drive to Woodland). Users/jlr29

20100412 12:18:32 nbsp If you have barfed or emitted bodily fluids do not tell them!! They will refuse to clean your car. I had cleaned up 95% of the barf and you could not smell it, but as soon as I mentioned it the guy there refused to take my car. And for all the haters  do you have any idea what they charge at the full service place in Woodland? A LOT more!  Users/dizzyditz

20110819 11:06:06 nbsp Wow. I have never posted a review before but had to comment on this place. I was selling my car and tossing up going to the effort to clean it up really nicely myself or take it here. Figured Id have it detailed here, then take care of the extras that theyd missed myself. I was extremely impressed, and couldnt have done a better job myself with all the time, cleaning products or tools (that I wouldve had to buy) in the world. There was not a single dog hair stuck in the carpet when they were done! And, I didnt have to do it! Granted it cost $165 but this included everything (hand polishing, carpet shampooing, headlight restoration, really thorough interior clean, leather conditioning etc). Ive never been through their regular car wash but enthusiastically recommend the detailing for presales.  Users/AllysonGroth

20120202 13:28:02 nbsp Place is great.  I took my car here before I sold it and they did a fine job.  Definitely felt like I got my moneys worth. Users/dazer1virginia

20120202 15:26:52 nbsp I havent actually been here, but I really like that this place closes for lunch.  Something about that just says doing it right to me. Users/TomGarberson

20120924 17:43:15 nbsp I just paid seven dollars (plus tip) and my car looks FANTASTIC.  They did not dry it off all the way in the back, but my car was super dirty with sap and bird poop and
bugs and now its beautiful. Just a teensy bit wet. I feel I got my moneys worth. They were efficient and nice and Im going to return. Users/CarolynDesmond

20130428 10:39:10 nbsp 15 Bucks for a inside/out clean was a bargain!! I have pets so It was nice to have a place very reasonably priced to get my car cleaned!!! Users/EmmyThill

20130827 08:32:04 nbsp If you value your time and just exhausted from your daily life then this is well worth the money. They did an excellent job inside and out nor did I have to wait very long. For around $23.00 plus a well deserved tip, they made my car look very nice. Hand dry, dressing on wheels, all windows excellently cleaned, interior cleaned and all vinyl coated with a nice protected shine. I will return on a monthly basis and will try out the hand wax and buffing soon. Users/richardpassmore

20140722 22:55:31 nbsp Wonderful experience today. They were very nice and did an amazing job cleaning my car. Will definitely go back! Users/CarrieAlexander
