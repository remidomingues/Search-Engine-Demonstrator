Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians own a huge Indian Casinos casino about 45 minutes from Davis. You only have to be 21 to Gambling gamble and Smoking smoking is allowed inside. What fun!

There are 12 Texas Holdem tables. Half of them are for $3/$6 games, and the rest are split between $4/$8 and nolimit games. On Saturday nights, expect up to a 2.5 hour wait for a table.

The steakhouse, C2, is incredible, and if you feel like spending $30+ on a steak, is FAR better than Cattlemens or the Buckhorn.  If youve got the cash, its a great place to take a date.  After appetizers and entrees for two people, plus tax and tip, expect to pay close to $100. AviBirns

20070811 11:30:26 nbsp Tried the $18 buffet for the first time, and it reminded me of the food served at military mess halls, particularly in the South.  Nearly everything seems to have either butter, cheese, oil or gravy (or all of the above) on it.  What can I say?  Ive been spoiled by the Segundo Dining Commons!

The good news is I made back the $18 playing the slots.  Come to think of it, nearly every time Ive played the slots at Cache Creek, Ive come away on the plus side. Users/DukeMcAdow
