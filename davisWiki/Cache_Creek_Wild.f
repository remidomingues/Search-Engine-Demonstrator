Cache Creek Wild is the campaign to designate Cache Creek as a Wild and Scenic River. Wilderness designation would preserve the public lands and the free flow of water along Cache Creek in Yolo County Yolo, Napa, Lake, and Colusa counties. Lots of Automobiles cars in Davis have blue Cache Creek Wild stickers on them, showing the large community support to protecting our local wild lands.

    Tips on letter writing:
 As someone who works with legislative staff quite a bit, I can say that receiving a lot of the same letter is far less impressive than receiving a lot of different ones.  If you write your own letter and just use the mockup as an outline (rather than a template), your letter may even end up in the bill file (which will likely be preserved for posterity at the State Archives).
