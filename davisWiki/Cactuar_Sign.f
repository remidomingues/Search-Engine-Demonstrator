There was a wiki:Wikipedia:Cactuar Sign spotted at the north east corner of Wellman Hall around October 9^th^, 2007. It appeared at the same time as the Dihydrogen Monoxide Warning Signs and is likely also the work of the CCCC. (If I am reading that itty bitty text right)

20071011 17:48:31 nbsp No, it couldnt POSSIBLY be CCCC. The REAL Crusade NEVER EVER POSTS ANYTHING OVER GENUINE TRAFFIC SIGNS and will DEFINITELY NEVER DO IT AGAIN. FOR SERIOUS. I AM TALKING TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Users/BarnabasTruman

20071011 20:45:16 nbsp Youre right.  This has nothing to do with the real CCCC.  They must be impostors. Users/BrentLaabs
