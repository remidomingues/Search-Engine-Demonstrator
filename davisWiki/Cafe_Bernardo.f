Cafe Bernardo is really two restaurants inone: fullservice on one side, and an orderatthecounter eatery on the other.  The full service restaurant is good if youre looking for Good Ideas For Dates a decent place to take a date.  Its not as fancy or expensive as Seasons but is still a good restaurant. The atmosphere is fairly relaxed. A sticker in the window states the restaurant is a Wifi Hotspots wifi hotspot.

They use some local and seasonal ingredients as well as freerange meat.  Their coffee is not fair trade.  They have an odd substitution policy that some have found offputting: you can only substitute vegetable for vegetable, starch for starch.

The eatery typically features a nowait sandwich that is premade, and is excellent if you are in a hurry. Theyve got good tea and quiche, and an excellent grilled salmon BLT.   Vegetarians have several good options, including the quiche, salads, portobello mushroom sandwich, spaghettini, grilled polenta triangles, quesadilla, cherry tomato pizzetta, and calzone. The quality of the food drastically varies depending on the chef.

The Bars bar, officially called Bar Bernardo, is on the fullservice side of the restaurant.  The bars hours are: MonWed: until 11:00 pm; ThurSat: until 1:00 am; Sun: until 10:00 pm.  The WikiWackyWoo (no relation to the Wiki!) is particularly excellent.

20090124 19:49:25 nbsp I go here frequently, and as I veteran Davis foodie I love Bernardos! Users/AndrewBianchi

20090128 20:58:28 nbsp I love the food and eat at Bernardos all the time, but when I showed up just after 8:30 this evening to order takeout, the cashier said they were closed even though she admitted they close at 9 pm (???). . . Not a good business practice. Users/britti

20090329 13:20:24 nbsp Really bad and unfriendly service. A waitress pretty threw a hissy fit at me and my friends when our order wasnt sent out right. Over priced for what you get too. That plus attitude should  pass it by and walk on over to Crepe Ville, Burgers & Brew or Sophies Thai. All much better choices! Users/poggle

20090412 23:35:54 nbsp Very disappointed in this cafe. Not only do they charge $2.25 for a regular coffee, but they charged me $3.75 for a glass of orange juice, the cheap kind from a gallon jug nonetheless, when I can go to the grocery store and actually buy at least a quart of high quality juice for less than $3. Also, the food was minimal at best. I ordered french toast, and that was all I got, 2 pieces of french toast with hardly any flavor.

The staff was preoccupied in conversations between themselves to care about customer service, and one waitress wanted to take my plate before I was even finished eating.

I will not return here, for the cost of the minimal food, I can get 23 times more food at Crepeville or Little Prague. Definitely out of touch with quality implies being able to charge higher prices. Users/BrandonBarrette

20090413 10:41:24 nbsp A couple of quick comments.  You can eat in the bar and its much quieter.  The service isnt much faster, but the servers are friendly and competent.  I had the huevos rancheros yesterday.  If youre expecting standup Mexican cooking, youll be disappointed.  I was. Users/JimStewart

20090426 21:30:54 nbsp I have breakfast here at least twice a week and like their oatmeal, egg dishes, and French toast. The service is great and the food
arrives quickly. There are also one or more newspapers on the shelf near the water that you can read while eating. I enjoy chatting with the staff: Mary, Amber, Paul, and the others. Users/nowhereman

20090614 15:36:11 nbsp The 2 eggs, herbed potatos and turkey sausage makes a great nonpork carnivore breakfast, something thats a bit hard to find. Users/JimStewart

20091108 20:22:38 nbsp The french toast with fruit on top is to die for! so delicious, I go there just to order it. BUT the bad thing is that they only serve it until 11 am on the weekdays, 1 pm on Saturday, and 2 pm on Sunday...They really need to extend the breakfast hours!

besides that, it is generally overpriced. Although the food is good, it comes in small quantities for big bucks. The heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad is DELISH, but whos going to pay 8.50 for a tomato and some cheese? Users/mrandmrs

20091121 15:00:57 nbsp My wife and I recently moved from Sacramento to Davis. We were happy to see one of our favorite midtown restaurants was also in Davis. My wife always gets the Eggs Bernardo and thinks its the best Eggs Benedict shes ever had. The staff is usually pretty friendly, and they seem to be well trained. Users/TheoMonk

20091206 23:22:20 nbsp My girlfriend and I went here tonight together for the first time and found the overall experience to be very nice. Yes, we had to get up and ask for a refill on the iced tea but we didnt mind that. We had the Portobello sandwich and the Butternut Squash Pizza with no cheese, adding spinach and pesto. I absolutely loved this pizza, and the portobello sandwich was good too.

Compared to many other places we frequent in town there was a more pleasant ambiance here, and the food was quite good. We enjoyed hanging out there enough to order a hot tea and cake (yeah, a bit pricey). Well be back. Users/Brett

20091229 12:21:02 nbsp Best coffee in Davis.  Food is very good, although sometimes inconsistent depending on the chef.  I usually get the steak or chicken plate which is fantastic. They often use local farm fresh ingredients. Breakfasts are also excellent.  The place could use a fresh coat of paint as it is a little dingy and looking a little run down.  Staff needs to pay attention to the music.  I was in there during the week for a late breakfast and the crowd was older....they had Rush and Metallica cranked.  Service is usually good, but if there is a long line, you may want to wait as the kitchen isnt built for large crowds and the service slows down. Users/stodd84

20100707 16:39:38 nbsp Good menu, somewhat reasonable prices. After five visits and the order repeatedly coming out wrong, we are really fed up with the antisocial chick with the glasses. Asking a question about the food is some sort of crime, and you wont hear please, thank you, youre welcome, is there anything else?, how can I help you? or any of that from her. In this economy, I cannot believe some people still have jobs. The Wednesday night burger special is well worth it if you prefer to eat freerange meat. The pickles on the burger are strange. Lovely salads. Cheap desserts. A couple of servers are superfriendly and helpful. The service just isnt consistent and the one I mentioned makes the place almost not worth the negativity. Reading these posts, the only other thing Ill say is that whereas someone said this place is one for the white folk, I havent found that to be exclusively true. While that crappy comment could be misconstrued, I would be more inclined to try the new Ethiopian restaurant when it opens if I saw what appeared to be people from the Horn of Africa eating there. FFS.  Users/seesharp

20100716 17:43:56 nbsp I like this place. Its fun to watch the brick oven fire. I like the location too; you can sit outside and watch the people go by. Users/JasperD

20100720 07:36:38 nbsp Ive generally been happy with the food at Bernardos, and its only two blocks from my house, so who can complain?  However, I got very frustrated awhile back and stopped going because they had an absurd substitution policy.  Most of their entrees had a protein, a veggie and a starch.  I was trying to be healthy and skip the starch and just ask for more veggies, and the counter people (multiple ones) said we can only substitute a vegetable for a vegetable or a starch for a starch.  The sides menu, however, had these items as costing the same, so it didnt seem to make a lot of sense, but rather seemed to be a computer programming thing at the register.  I wouldnt have minded a small chargelike Crepevilles charge to substitute fruit for potatoesbut the rigidness of the policy seemed absurd.  Does anyone know if they still do this? Users/ScottLay

20101020 00:52:39 nbsp I like the food but I dont love it.
I like the quality of the ingredients but I dont love it (fibrous crater filled avocadoes chunks are not acceptable IMO).
The service isnt bad but I dont love it.
Overall, this place isnt bad but I dont love it.
Now is the time where I would tell you what is worth coming here for but I really
dont think there was anything exceptional that I could recommend to anyone...at all...how sad.
And yes, I agree with the comments about there being a yuppie vibe.

20110503 13:30:06 nbsp I had dinner here on Sunday, and the grilled salmon BLT was really good. The bread wasnt too dry and the salmon and tomatoes went really well together along with the bacon of course. :) Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110812 16:55:36 nbsp I had lunch here today and it was Delicious! I have always liked the food here. My only complaint is I have always tipped when I pay for my food and I never have received Refills, sometimes silverware, or any type of service. I guess I will stop tipping at the beginning and only when if ever I have service! Users/Sherri

20110812 18:04:36 nbsp I want to qualify this by saying I dont like making negative reviews.  I think everyone should find out for themselves if a place is worth going to, if theyre really interested in going.  That being said, the difference between this location and the others Ive been to (midtown Sac, R St., Roseville before it closed) is simply night and day.  Bottom line, if you have a choice, dont waste your time at this location.  I have been to the midtown Sac location many, many times (and the R st.  a few times), and the food and service are far superior.  Recently, after visiting both the Davis and Midtown locations within the span of a couple weeks, I felt obligated to compliment the chef at the midtown location, as his food was (again) far superior... I also told him about our problems at the David location.  He thanked me and said he had a problem with the Davis location as well, and that I should share my views with ownership.

Its a shame really, because every other Paragarys owned restaurant Ive been to has been excellent.  Consistently great food, great service.  Not at the Davis Bernardos.  By my experience, the food and the service have been consistently poor (weve tried 4 different times, no improvement).  My stir fry noodles were mealy and flavorless.  They actually burned the bread on our sandwiches (!?!) But what I find really strange is that the service is pretty poor too.  Its strange in that they really dont have much to do in terms of table service... just bring your food out, get you some ketchup maybe.  No taking your food order, nor any drink orders... pretty simple.  But when my wife dared to ask for some ranch for her fries, the server said it would be $1 extra and then walked away.  Wow.  And this was AFTER they grossly undercooked her turkey burger and it had to be sent back.  To her credit, the manager was apologetic after the turkey burger incident, but the replacement was not much better (cooked, edible, but flavorless).  The manager also also apparently then pulled a David Copperfield, because she was unavailable when I asked to see her about the ranch snub a few short minutes later.

Sorry again to bash this place.  Dont take my word for it, just do this: Next time youre in Sacramento, visit the R (at 15th) or the Midtown location... then compare (them) to the Davis location, and youll know exactly what Im talking about. Users/OldDavis73

20110829 03:31:48 nbsp To be honest, I only come to this place for one thing: their Wicky Wacky Woo or what I prefer to call their wiki. Last week, my friends and I decided to stop by Cafe Bernardo to grab a few drinks. We had our drinks and then left. I thought everything was cool until I checked my checking account and found that they charged me for 4 wikis when I only ordered 2 wikis. This could be just a simple mistake, but I hope I get my money back.  Users/KristineLalic

20110924 10:00:35 nbsp I think this place has gone downhill. I really used to like italthough the portions arent huge for the price, the was food was always really good. Recently went in for a large chopped salad to go which took forever to arrive and then it was surprisingly small and mostly lettucewhich is antithetical to the whole idea of the chopped salad. Im wary to go back.  Users/BrentKago

20111018 22:58:18 nbsp Really, really, mediocre place. Im not sure how Cafe Bernardo is still open, because everything you find here you could probably find elsewhere at a better price, and with better service. Its breakfast foods (go to Black Bear Diner), sandwiches (deli, bistro 33) and everything else is just salads and pizzas that you could easily find elsewhere in Davis.

I went there with my boyfriend yesterday after having gone a couple times in the past couple years, and everytime weve been back, we were more disappointed. We had the chuck burger and the steak sandwich with fries, and one soda and that came out to be about $25 wtf. And they also charge you 1.50 for a teeny slice of cheese. Also, its pay up front, and its silly to tip and stuff and not ever have the server come by and refill our drinks. ALSO, the portions of the actual burger/sandwich was sad. It was pretty tasty, but so not worth 10 bucks each. Plus, the fries you have to pay EXTRA for. Wtf? What kind of establishment doesnt automatically serve fries with burgers/sandwiches? Its like a no brainer. And the fries that we got were sooooo over salted that we couldnt even bear to have ketchup with them.

We wont be going back there again. If you want burgers/sandwiches/salads/pizzas, go to Burgers&Brew, Bistro 33, Rostinis, Village Bakery, etc.  Users/susiebear

20130104 08:56:37 nbsp I recommend the butternut squash omelette for breakfast. Overall, Ive had mostly tasty meals here with quality ingredients. The workers Ive encountered have always been pleasant and hardworking. Users/ScottMeehleib

The breakfast burrito is good, so is the potatoes. Bernadoes shines at breakfast and is solid the rest of the time Daubert
