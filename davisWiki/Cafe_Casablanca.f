20060512 07:54:53 nbsp Does it take the entire building?  In the past, the building has been subdivided. Users/JabberWokky

20060512 09:32:05 nbsp theres something on the left side that look like its under construction Users/CraigBrozinsky

20060521 11:53:54 nbsp The restaurant is split up into a restaurant side and a bar side. There were originally supposed to be two seperate owners, but the person who was supposed to buy the bar fell through, so now the owner of Cafe Casablanca is in the process of buying the bar as well. It will be a jazz lounge and hopefully open up in the next 2 to 3 months. Users/JennySoares

20060524 21:43:17 nbsp WOW EXPENSIVE!  The setting was completely cute with the movie going for people who wait to be seated.  The service was excellent.  The food was decent but definately not worth the price.  I ended up paying $20 for an entree, drink, tax and tip.  If they bring down their prices, then Ill return. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060702 13:48:30 nbsp Breakfast is very good here. Huge plates. You get four sausage links when ordering the sausage and each are the size of a hotdog. The decor is amazing and the prices are no different than any other eatery in Davis. The atmosphere tho is truly neat. Antiques, movie memorabilia and fun wait staff. Weve been back 3 times and will continue to patronize this fun place Users/DavidWebb

20070701 14:51:22 nbsp Hi, I used to be the lead hostess there and yes they are closed for good. That building is the biggest health violation ever and we simply could known run a restuarant there. Place needs to be flattened and built from the ground up

20100128 20:18:05 nbsp Hello Everyone, I was one of the owners of the Rock Hard Cafe, the owner of the property was real shady, and the the manager of the hotel was even a bigger crook & liar, I saw that this building should have been condemned, its heating and Air conditioning was faulty, the structure was subpar, and after my partners continuely lied about the terms and conditions of the contract, I decided to vacate the premises, its too bad because between the two partners and the owner of Cafe Casablanca they just didnt have enough experience to be sucessful!
