Davis is home to many cozy little cafés.  They make a great alternative to Shields Library for studying, provide entertainment, comfy chairs, and also, of course, tons of coffee.  The ones listed under bakeries make their own Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods baked goods (or claim to!). Many cafes make Good Ideas For Dates good ideas for dates.

Some cafés are open late into the night time.
