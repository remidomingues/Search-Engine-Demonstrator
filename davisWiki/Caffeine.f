Caffeine is a legal, overthecounter drug found in everything from soda to Sobe, cola to coffee. It is especially popular in high school and college in nerd circles, in part because it aids late night activity like computer science coding and video games. In recent years, major beverage companies (and Jamba Juice) have popularized the natural caffeine source wiki:WikiPedia:Guarana guarana, in large part because its come ups and come downs are less jagged than traditional sources.

Caffeine is the only drug in which the dosage does not have to be stated on the container. Who knows how much Mountain Dew, Pepsi, your root beer, or your coffee has in it? This is wrong. Sometimes you want more, sometimes less, but it should be written.

Caffeine can be acquired:

  As Coffee coffee or Tea tea from various Cafes cafes
  In pill form from Grocery Stores grocery and Pharmacies drug stores
  Stolen from labs on Campus campus
