Caffino serves a variety of drive though hot/cold drinks, both caffeinated and decaffeinated as well as pastries. Caffinos prices are lower than either Starbucks or Silo Brenans, and the service is much faster, even when theres a line of cars in the morning. If youre a regular, they usually remember your drink, how you like it, and which side of the cup you sip from
 now thats what I call service!

20060818 07:45:22 nbsp Caffino is one of my favorite coffee places in town! By the time I need caffeine enough to shell out bucks, I need it fast, I need it strong, and I need it good at a reasonable price. Caffino hits all three and the service is the best Ive ever received at any coffee bar. And they absolutely do remember how you like your coffee if you come in with any regularity. These guys actually deserve their tips! Users/AlphaDog

20071203 01:14:01 nbsp This place is great, and it is true that if you are a regular they do remember how you like your coffee. Staff is really nice.  Users/RDN

20080731 11:55:57 nbsp Fast and friendly service.They make the best classic caramel latte. Users/jasen

20090331 22:24:50 nbsp This place is super convenient and awesome. Im so sad they reduced the hours. Where am I to go to perk up for late night studyoutings? Users/Hyungmi

20090504 16:53:16 nbsp Who say theyre good? I gave them 2 chances and both times were bad. Their coffee are so sweet, containing a lot of sugar and syrup. I also tried the smoothie, cant taste or see the fruit at all, again, only syrup and sugar. Will never come back. Users/thtly

20090815 23:54:17 nbsp You cant say anything bad about Caffino. Fast, friendly service, and the best coffee I can think of for the price. Overly pretentious coffee houses have nothing on them. A triple iced espresso will set you back a dollar and eighty five.  Users/Darren22

20100917 08:03:50 nbsp I dont know about them remembering which side of the cup you sip from, but when I used to ride past here on my way to school in the mornings, when they saw me coming theyd start making my mocha! I even got one or two free on days I wasnt going to buy one. Much love guys.  Great service, and excellent teas as well.   Users/MasonMurray

20101230 14:22:02 nbsp Hands down the BEST coffe shop in town! They serve amazing Mighty Leaf Teas!!! The staff members are always smiling and they remember all the regular customers drinks! I look forward to driving through every morning!!!  Users/CorkyCredit
