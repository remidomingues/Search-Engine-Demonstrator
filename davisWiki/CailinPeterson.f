ACE Hardware Davis Ace Hardware employee, new to the Davis community and excited to learn more about it.

Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Welcome to the Wiki!  I restored some of the historical information about ACE because one of the wikis many functions is chronicling Davis history.  For example, believe it or not, there are some pretty serious Payphone Project pay phone aficionados on the wiki, and a surprising number of pages devoted to pay phones.  Thanks for updating information on the name and so on. Users/TomGarberson

Dont worry about messing up; its easy to fix anything, and other than the wiki isnt for promoting businesses (which is a common misconception), everything is pretty common sense.  If theres a good reason for something, everybody generally figures out a way to make it work.  Welcome to the Wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
