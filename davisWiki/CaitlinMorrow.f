Caitlin Morrow is a student at UC Davis.  She is a San Diegan native enjoys delightful Davis just as much and feels really settled in.  These are some of the things she loves most about living in Davis:

 1. The California Raptor Center
 2. UCD
 3. Turkey Vultures
 4. The Avid Reader
 5. Old Davis Road & the Arboretum


Bike riding is amazing and convenient.  Too bad it doesnt really work all that well in San Diego.  It would be nice to never own a car (I am not a fan of cars or driving).  One thing I am a big fan of is birding.  Davis is a great place for looking at birds.
