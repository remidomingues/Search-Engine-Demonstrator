In 2008, Cal.NET merged with Sierra Advantage in Shingle Springs, and has changed their service and support practices drastically from their early years.  Wiki Comments and reviews of their service prior to this merge (dated 2005 through 2007) were Cal.NET/2005 through 2007 Reviews moved here.  Most of these reviews were negative.  Cal.NET also used to offer MDL service to Glacier Point Apartments Glacier Point and Saratoga West Apartments Saratoga West apartment complexes, ending this service their their 2008 changes. An angry and extensive review of that service and mostly of the company circa 2003/2004 can be read Cal.NET/Business and MDL Review 2004 here.

Cal.net currently provides dialup and DSL services, as well as Web Hosting, and other high speed data alternatives such as T1 lines.

20090831 10:44:11 nbsp Greetings, i have a client with their DNS servers that are incorrectly set to 4.2.2.1 & 4.2.2.2. I just called your office # at 5307578088 but no one picked up, I had to leave a message. Hopefully someone will contact me within the hour?

I just need to know what the correct DNS servers are for Cal.net/AT&T and i can be contacted at Cybershield  5307572010 or 9165431635

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide us and the community, im sure others are misconfigured. Users/Cybershield
 Those are L3 DNS servers. Theyre actually anycasted, so they work well just about anywhere. I would hardly consider using them to be a misconfiguration. Nonetheless, Cal.net puts the IP addresses of their DNS servers on their website in a http://main.cal.net/tech_support/calnetsystem_settings.php very easy to find place, if you bothered to check.
