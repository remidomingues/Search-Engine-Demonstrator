CalFresh, formerly Food Stamps, is a program designed to help lowincome individuals and families obtain free food. Qualifying households are issued a card which can be used fairly discretely much like a debit card.  The card is a type of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Benefit_Transfer EBT card.  A certain amount of money is allocated to a household each month based on family size and income, and the average amount designated per individual is $150, http://www.dailydemocrat.com/news/ci_20379052/moreyolocountyresidentsusingfoodstamps according to the Daily Democrat. In January of 2012, about 8% of all Yolo County residents were receiving CalFresh benefits. The percentage has risen dramatically in recent years due to worsening economic conditions.
