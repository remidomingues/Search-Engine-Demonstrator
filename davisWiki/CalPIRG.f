http://www.calpirgstudents.org/ CALPIRG is the California Public Interest Research Group.

CalPIRG is a grassroots public interest group that lobbies for issues that they believe are relevant to the general public. They mainly focus on higher education, clean energy, Community Homelessness Awareness Dinner hunger and homelessness, ocean protection, and voter registration. They work with other PIRGs nationwide. There are chapters at every UC System UC, except for UC Merced Merced (although, they have been running Energy Service Corps, a joint program with AmeriCorps, there since 2010.)   CALPIRG also has chapters in some CSUs, city colleges and at USC.


They have an office in 356 MU. The current campus organizer is Naomi Flagg, who graduated from UC Berkeley. The previous organizer was Rikki Seguin, who graduated from the University of Florida. For the 20062007 school year the organizer was Tara Stafford who graduated from USC. The campus organizers for the 20052006 school year were Andy Bemis and Ben Smith.  You could often find Ben in a Cows cow suit, or some other Costumes costume.

The current Chapter Chair is Economics and International Relations major, Edson Perez, and the ViceChair is Donna Farvard, a third year NPB major. For the 20112012 school year, the campus chair was Donna Farvard, who is also in the CALPIRG Statewide Board. For the 20062007 school year Dallas Cole was campus chair and Michael Reagan was vicechair. Dan Xie, Users/AimeeMaireMunozLopez AimeeMarie MunozLopez, and Karen Park made up the other officers. In 20052006 the chairs were Users/AimeeMaireMunozLopez AimeeMarie MunozLopez and Garo Manjikian.

Twice a year youll find them on campus asking you to pledge $10 to them, allowing them to fund their campaigns and hire a professional staff of researchers, lobbyists, and campus organizers.  This $10 pledge you make is deducted from your student account every quarter making a total of $30 for the year.  You get a bright orange sticker that says, I pledged CALPIRG.  This fund raising may cause people to seek Magic Items of Davis protection from CALPIRG.  This funding keeps them on campus, as 20% of UC Davis students must pledge in order for them stay on campus. The staff hired is essential for CALPIRG.  Campus organizers and statewide staff members train students on how to run effective grassroots campaign involving students in politics.

If you are lucky enough to have a CALPIRG sticker in your possession you will have the warm, fuzzy feeling that you have done something good for the world.  The CALPIRG sticker, if properly placed within an amulet, is also one of the Magic Items of Davis.

 Depledging 

If you believe that CALPIRG is not representing you properly, then you can go up to CALPIRGs office in 356 MU and ask them to remove you from the pledge list.

 Criticism 

CalPIRG is mainly criticized for their pushy soliciting during Pledge Week, but there are other criticisms as well. One major criticism of the organization is that they tend to be very partisan on some issues although they are a nonpartisan nonprofit group (the following bullet points might be too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian libertarian for some):

  They support a high speed rail project without considering the http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id9753 environmental and economic side effects.
  They supported tax rebates for solar panels without considering http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id6043 potential environmental and economic concerns.
  They propose more governmentbacked student loans when http://www.youtube.com/watch?vAIcfMMVcYZg others consider this to be the problem.
  They supported the idea for UC Davis UC Davis and the ASUCD to work together to create a textbook rental program, when the ASUCD Book Exchange requires subsidies from students and the UC Davis Bookstore is known for ripping students off. This textbook rental program at the UC Davis Bookstore was successfully created in 2010.


20080917 21:36:40 nbsp Ive donated a few times in my life from people who have come up to me and talked to me. Unfortunately, I also gave them my number. Now Ive been getting calls almost every day around 69:30PM from their 800 number. I answered once and said no and I dont want anymore calls. They still call. This is my punishment for the sin of donating to a cause. Theres no way Im giving another dime to CALPIRG. Their numbers are 8006723012 and 8006723014. Google these numbers and find many others who are pissed. Getting approached once on the street or at home is one thing, having a computer dial your number at dinner or sleeping time almost every day is harassment. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20081229 12:53:58 nbsp Please!! I do i get off their donation list?!?!?! thankz to whom ever in advance! D Users/Dreabo0
  If you want to have any hope of getting off their pledge list, I think you need to consider the Importance of using your RealName.  They cant depledge you unless they know who you are. But see the new Depledging section above. Users/BrentLaabs

20091105 07:48:20 nbsp I do not really care for how Ive seen some CalPIRG members badgering people to pledge.  No or I need some time to think about it are not acceptable answers to some members.  And if you are skeptical about renting textbooks, run. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20110222 21:34:41 nbsp Honestly, I originally pledged CalPIRG as a naive freshman who supported their cause. That was until I realized that people werent kidding that once you pledge CalPIRG, youre trapped for life. This will be my 3rd consecutive quarter where I have been charged against my will, because of their failure to honor my request to unpledge. Calling the numbers, emailing them, and following up on both wont do a thing. Not only do they not listen, Im sure they dont take them seriously/are laughing all the way to the bank at our stupidity.

I was approached today by someone who asked me to pledge CalPIRG. I told them I had unpledged, and he had the most bewildered look, along the lines of You can do that?. Well, apparently you cant.

But, I refuse to give up. I will update people if I ever succeed at accomplishing this.

EDIT: So back in February, I was fuming about unpledging (or being unable to). Well, 3 months later (an entire quarter, basically?), I have received confirmation that Im unpledged, and will be receiving a refund check sometime around finals week/early summer.

Good luck, RajanSingh! Youll have to be persistent and call their listed numbers/resort to calling them nonstop if they fail to honor your request (as I did). 5/16/2011 Users/Jennyfish

20110323 15:36:06 nbsp Good luck Jennyfish! I want to depledge also. This organization is useless.. Users/RajanSingh

20111106 23:46:27 nbsp I will still never forget the one guy who harassed me (actually followed me while I walked) for a good 5 minutes.  Finally he said it just gets charged to your student account and your parents probably pay that anyway so why do you care about ten dollars?  To which I delivered a few choice words and said I pay that myself.  I dont care how good your cause may be, people like that turn me off pretty much entirely.   Users/OliviaY

20120312 21:27:53 nbsp I wish someone could make a sticker that says I WILL NOT PLEDGE CALPRIG. So sick of them bugging me every time I walk by the Coho and Library. Hell, I was eating in the tables outside the Coho last year and one sat down with me and spent around 5 minutes trying to convince me to pledge... Users/CecilioPadilla

20120321 22:21:05 nbsp I interned with CALPIRG this past quarter and it was really fun and I made a ton of new friends. Tough work being on the other side during Pledge Week, but its such a relief to actually get real work done, instead of just clicking sign on those online petitions your friends post on Facebook (you know what Im talking about!) Users/Tparkeressig

20121114 14:54:26 nbsp Beware of CalPIRG! Just had a really bad experience with this organization. Yes, what they stand for is good and all BUT they will continue to deduct money from you even after you have asked them to stop. I pledged $15 a month for over a year until I could no longer afford it. I emailed them several times asking them to stop with the direct deposits and JOHN FOX even replied to confirm. The following month the deductions continued so I asked again... then the following month they deducted it once more!!! I have now changed my account information to have it blocked but it was a horrible experience trying to get them to stop taking my money. I do not endorse calPIRG because of this they are pretty sketchy.  Users/antonioa

20130108 00:38:25 nbsp @antonioa: It took me consulting ASUCD legal services, building a case to file a claim, and emailing/calling the president of the UCD chapter at the time about a pending lawsuit if they were too incompetent to complete a simple request. Needless to say, within 24 hours, I received an actual response, and did end up receiving the $20 refund check in the mail that I posted about back in 2011.

But yes, sketchy practices and nearly impossible to get a hold of in person! Users/Jennyfish
