The Alumni Association for campus. They have over 24,000 dues paying members.  Considering that this is smaller than the amount of students that attend UC Davis currently, this is a rather miniscule proportion of alumni that are in this association.

Most schools are all about keeping their alumni in touch with one another and in touch with the university, and so they give alumni a user@alumni.school.edu acount. However, at Davis, you have to buy your way into the alumni association to get such an address, despite the fact that hardly anyone does so.  No wonder there isnt much love for the alumni association.  Users/JaimeRaba Â—jr

The Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) has recently offered a limited number of Community Memberships to CAAA members who are not graduates of UC Davis.
