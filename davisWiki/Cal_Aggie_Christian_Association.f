Since purchasing the property in 1955, there was an empty lot behind the main building.

In response to the http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/12/09/FrontPage/Christian.Association.Project.Tests.New.City.Council.Policies1319023.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com lawsuit, which many believe was a classic case of NIMBYism, The Aggie printed an http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/03/Opinion/Editorial.City.Cant.Ignore.Students1319445.shtml?norewrite200606071612&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com editorial criticizing the neighborhood association for trying to alienate the citys students. On December 9, 2005, the Yolo County Superior Court denied the lawsuit. At the end of March 2006, the neighborhood association appealed the decision, delaying possible construction.

There was a groundbreaking ceremony in fall 2007, and the community opened to residents in fall 2008.  The community follows the principles of community, faith, social justice, and simplicity of lifestyle.
