The Cal Aggie Flying Farmers is the primary FBO (fixed base operator) at the University Airport. They offer rentals, provide Flying flight instruction and offer familiarization flights. It is a common misconception that CAFF runs the airport as well, but services such as fuel hangar space are actually provided by Transportation And Parking Services TAPS and UCD.

20100625 14:55:12 nbsp CAFF is the only flying club in Davis, located on the UCD campus airport. They have been operating since 1947!  You can learn to fly here and also rent planes (under strict rules).  I did. Their rates are low, but not necessarily worth the drive from Sacramento.  Planes are 1970s era but very well maintained. Recently new leadership has made rules much more strict; a few mistakes by a few dummies has made things hard on everyone else.  All instructors are good, but vary in personality.  Best to stick with one that you like for consistency. Users/rednoodler

 20100627 13:11:20 nbsp Ive flown with Mike Nelson as a student pilot and found him to be a descent CFI. Your flight instructors criticism is meant to keep you safe and legal. No one likes criticism, including myself. But the last thing you want is for your flight instructor is to sugar coat their feedback. If you are doing something wrong, youve got to know. Id take the harshest instructor criticism any day over talking to NTSB, losing my license, or crashing. With that said, different instructors have different personalities (they are people), so feel free to talk to few of them and see which one you are most comfortable with. As far as the club, prices are low due to being a notforprofit, I personally havent found the rules to be stricter than other clubs. If the weather is bad, you shouldnt fly in the first place. Club offers insurance with rentals and they get a great deal due to incredibly low accident rate. Planes are quickly booked so if you are planning a long trip, you have to reserve a week or two in advance.  Users/KevinW
