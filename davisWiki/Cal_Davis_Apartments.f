20130707 21:59:51 nbsp We have stayed at Cal Davis Apartments for three years. The landlord Bob Hayden is really nice. The only reason we moved out is because we were moving out of the country. He is a landlord who believes in listening to the tenants and returning security deposits. The apartments are clean and well maintained but not fancy. I would highly recommend this place for the location, cleanliness and a great landlord.  Users/DivyaAiyar

20140413 21:24:14 nbsp My roommates and I have lived here for 7 months and it is literally the worst living situation that Ive had in my four years here. The apartment is tiny and prett pricy compared to other places nearby. We have been having issues with the wifi, the appliances, bugs, thin walls (we can hear our neighbors phones vibrate) and weve never seen the actual landlord. Ever. He takes forever to respond when we have a problem, and often doesnt respond at all. Honesty, we thought we were getting a deal because the place didnt require a deposit. But its not worth it there are plenty of places much better close by! Users/LeonnaSpilman
