20090219 21:01:48 nbsp I had him diagnose and fix a leak in my roof that previous roofers had briefly fixed but made worse.  He made several visits to find and fix this sneaky and difficult to detect leak, and his prices were very reasonable.  I have referred him to neighbors already!  If you need a quick roof repair done right, call Robert! Users/Carsonsig
