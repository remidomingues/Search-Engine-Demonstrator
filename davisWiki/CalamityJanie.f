20080228 10:58:00 nbsp Howdy, Calamity... remember that you can just edit Dominos Pizza to correct the entry rather than just add a comment to it.  All the entries on the entire wiki are edited by people just like you  somebody who knows a little fact and makes that one entry just a little bit more interesting, correct and fun.  Always feel free to edit the entries themselves.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20080425 10:57:34 nbsp Hey there, I used to listen to Goth/industrial.  I can barely stand Gothic music anymore but I still really like Industrial.  You should have your boyfriend look up a band called blade fetish the album is absinthe it is pretty good.  My favorite industrial bands are Ministry, Front 242, and Babyland.  He should check those out if he is not familiar with them. Users/DagonJones

20080426 11:40:14 nbsp You are in very good hands with Dr. Shirazi.  He is an excellent periodontist (Dr. Jolkovsky is excellent too).  I am surprised you have never heard of Ministry, they are very good.  Best albums are Psalm 69 and the mind is a terrible thing to taste.  They are still one of my favorite bands. Users/DagonJones
