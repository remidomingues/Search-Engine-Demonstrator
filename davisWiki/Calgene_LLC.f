Founded in a garage in Davis in 1980, Calgene was bought out by Monsanto in 1996. Its operations continue to this day.

Calgene is a biotechnology research and development firm that at its height was routinely featured in the Wall Street Journal and was at the leading edge of the biotech boom. They are famous for their work with tomatoes, canola oil and cotton. They developed the Flavr Savr Tomatoes, but the product was not a commercial success.

In the race to bring their products to market they bought subsidiary companies in Idaho, Arizona, Tennessee and Mississippi.

Belinda Martineau wrote a book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail//0071360565?vglance First Fruit: The Creation of the Flavr Savr Tomato and the Birth of Biotech Foods that discusses the process of bringing the Flavr Savr to market.
