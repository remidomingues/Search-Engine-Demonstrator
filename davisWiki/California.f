Davis is located in the wiki:WikiPedia:California State of California, the most populous state in the U.S..  wiki:WikiPedia:Economy_of_California Californias economy is so big that if the state were considered a separate country, it would still have between the fourth and tenth largest economy in the world (of course, were it a separate country, the new budget for items like military spending and new import/export laws would likely knock it down the list quite a bit).  The gross state product is currently somewhere around 1.543 trillion USD.

California is often called the gold Golden State, and the fact that it was admitted to the union in 1850 probably had something to do with the discovery of gold.

Geography


This large and populous state is usually divided up into Northern California (aka NorCal), Southern California (aka SoCal), Central California, and the Central Coast.  There are a few odd cultural differences between NorCal and SoCal.  Most people see people from SoCal as amusing and fun, but a few people get strangely bitter and angry about such issues as The THE Controversy.

Note: Many people that live in Southern California (Or what Northern Californians call SoCal) never ever use the term SoCal!!  As a former Southern Californian citizen for about 6 years, we never use that term!!!
