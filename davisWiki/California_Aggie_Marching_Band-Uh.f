Far and wide, many have tried, but none have done it better.

The California Aggie Marching Banduh! is the official UC Davis marching band. The band, which has roughly 200 members, plays at both home and away games to cheer on the UC Davis Aggies sports teams, participates in several parades, and performs at numerous other community events. The band members show up for their engagements in either their formal blue and gold marching uniforms, or their more casual white shirt, blue jeans, and buttonladen floppy hat outfits, known as the Mavrik Band uniform.

The Banduh! has released two compact discs of its music, Barn Party in 1998 and Noise Violation in 2002. The bands 130+ song catalog is  composed of campus traditionals like the Aggie Fight song as well as renditions of popular rock songs, such as Green Days Welcome to Paradise, Edgar Winters Frankenstein, and Jefferson Airplanes White Rabbit, among others.

The announcement used to present the Banduh! at every Aggie home game is usually as follows, with occasional minor variations:

Fast, furious, and foaming at the mouth,
XBold, blue, and bitchin,X
## No longer used
Its the pride of the Regents of the University of California,
The spirit of the Davis Campus,
The California Aggie Marching Banduh!

The Marching Banduh! is the most insane of the Student Organizations. They are studentrun, they have many and very old Traditions tradition. They still like to use the Oldschool Aggie Logo. These guys are total band dorks, and proud of it. Some of the more technicallyinclined extend their participation to drum corps in the region, such as the Concord Blue Devils, the Santa Clara Vanguard, and the Sacramento Mandarins  so if you need a carpool to camp or practices, ask around!

Anyone can become a member of the Banduh!, provided that he or she is a current student at UCD.

 History 
Until May 13, 1980, The Cal Aggie Band (official name of the Banduh!) was a unit of ASUCD.  Control of the Banduh! was transferred to the university by an agreement between ASUCD President John Statton and Executive Vice Chancellor Elmer W. Learn.  $15,058 in reserves was transferred from ASUCD to the Administration with the Banduh.

The Banduh! has a new band room in the northeast corner of the ARC, as of Spring 2004. Prior to that they used a much smaller and rundown room in the old Firehouse, also known as the Old Bandroom.  This is the location of many a Banduh! horror story; unfortunately, those who remember actually using this room have left, or are leaving very soon.

In 2007, the band hired a new director after having been without one for four years.  Thomas Slabaugh II began his freshman year (in band) in July and will hopefully be instrumental (ha!) in preserving the future of the band for future Aggies.  Slabaugh apparently hasnt worked out very well and has http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2008/10/06/MNM7135E1B.DTL&tsp1 filed a sexual harassment complaint with UCD.

In January 2008, the Clinton campaign did not pay their bill for an appearance, causing the University to threaten to refer the total amount (including cleanup fees, etc) to a collection agency in April.  $500 was for the UC Davis Marching Band.

A more expansive history of the Banduh! can be found on the http://cru.ucdavis.edu/content.cfm?contentID52 History webpage.

 General Traditions 
These are just a few of the many things that the Banduh! does.

  They always stay around after games and play a few songs, then Aggie Fight.  This is known as rallying.
  They ring the Victory Bell after every home football game.
  They travel to UC Davis Football games across the country, and attend all home Mens and Womens basketball games as allowed by Big West regulations.
  XThey do things the way the California Aggie Alumni Marching Band Alumni did when they were in the Aggie Band.X
  Driving Unitrans buses, aka Banduhtrans:  In recent years, many of the drivers for Unitrans have also been involved with the BandUh!  Why?  Maybe well never know..
  XThe BandUh Sushi ChallengeX not actually a thing.
  Performing Bossy Cow Cow  Voted by Sports Illustrated in 1997 as The Most Obtuse Cheer
  XAlways Going the Distance and never missing an UC Davis Football Aggie Football game... EVER!  Even if that means riding a bus to South Dakota for 36 hours each way!X

Theres really only one way to know EVERY tradition the Banduh! has. Join it!

The Banduh! usually has a table somewhere in the CoHo, usually in the same place.  You might find them doing something goofy like making spur of the moment music, collaborating on a crossword, playing brainnumbingly exorbitant rounds of card games and Bananagrams, or even gasp studying.

 Bandwhat? 
Why is it called Banduh!?  If you carefully enunciate band over the microphone you end up with banduh! which turns into Banduh!

 Thats not my name! 
Speaking of the schwa (uh!), theres definitely some confusion about what the band ought to be called. The band refers to itself as:
  The University (of) California (at) Davis Aggie Banduh!  how the band introduces itself at gigs
  The Cal Aggie Marching Band (CAMB)
  The Cal Aggie Band
  The Aggie Band
  The Banduh!
The schwa can be added on any of these.

Please, please, please, when referring to the band on advertisements or ESPECIALLY if youre announcing them at a gig, do NOT call them any of the following:
  The University of California Davis Band
  The UC Davis Band
  The UC Davis Marching Band
  The Cal Davis Band (this is so so so wrong and I dont know who started it)
It sounds petty and nitpicky but saying any of the above will result in a bandwide cringe and general irritated mumbling. The band loves its CA and if you leave the Cal Aggies part of the name out, the CA makes no sense.

 Interested? 

XTo join, just show up to one of their Monday Night Rehearsal Monday night rehearsals.X

UPDATE: Due to the enormous number of new bandsmen this year, signups for the Banduh were closed for the first time in history sometime during fall quarter of 2013. The Banduh now constitutes over 300 members, and unfortunately, there simply arent enough instruments for more folks at the present moment. Stales will have to wait until the http://cru.ucdavis.edu/content.cfm?contentID55 Retreat  before fall quarter of 2014 to join. To see them perform, come to one of the basketball games at the ARC Pavillion!

In Remembrance:

20050705 09:03:10 nbsp I think its awesome that the BandUh marched and played in the San Francicso Pride Day Parade. I was marching a few groups behind them with people from all over the state. Everyone I was with was very happy to hear and see the BandUh Users/JimSchwab

20050707 22:13:35 nbsp Ive always wanted to ask: How about some new, modern songs? Does the person who says Lets play a song from this decade! get beaten mercilessly? Users/JoeConte

20050714 10:26:11 nbsp Thanks Jim!  The Pride Parade is one of our favorite gigs every year!  As for Joes question, anyone in the Banduh is welcome to arrange new music.  It just takes a while for new songs to catch on.  Our Picnic Day show this year did include songs by RX Bandits and Flogging Molly, so there is hope! Users/KateBaker
  Yeah the Picnic Day Battle of the Bands was way cooler then I thought it would be.  Everyone played all kinds of songs.  RX Bandits, Flogging Molly, Mighty Mighty Bosstones,  Nirvana (ok last decade yeah, but still nice), The Killers, the Offspring, and a bunch of other songs that Ive forgotten by now. Users/EdWins ES

20050718 23:44:11 nbsp Hey Kate: Do new arrangements have to made by a bandsperson, or could a normie arrange one if they wanted? Users/ThomasFifield
  Thomas, did you just say normie?  Because Im pretty sure that isnt a word... Users/AllisonEriksen
    Um, yes I did. And yes it is. Normie: (n) Someone not in the Banduh! So there. Its part of the Banduh! lingo. Like Ossifer. Or Yacket. Or VaJJ. OK? Users/ThomasFifield
  Thomas If someone not in band wanted to arrange, they would probably have to discuss it with the StuD (thats the Student Director for all you normies out there). Users/KateBaker

20050810 00:23:09 nbsp Oh golly gee whiz...look at the Banduh Wikites...smells like an EXTREME NET INVASION!!! Yes. Users/AndreHarris
  So basically, Andre, youre saying that most of the net section are dorks? :oP Users/ThomasFifield
   No, hes saying that the Nets are smart enough to know whats REALLY going on in Davis. Users/AllisonEriksen
    Dude, Andres right, this is extreme net invasion.  But it used to be worse, before he moved to trombone!  Ohhhh burn.  Flutes represent!  ...Or not.  Damn. Users/MargieHalloran

20061024 16:48:45 nbsp Banduh has kicked major ass since I can remember Users/StevenDaubert

20061208 11:29:13 nbsp Just in the senate the other day, Thursday December 7th 2006, and that BandUh shows up.. very awesome, very fun, very loud, and perhaps one of the most interesting senate meetings I have so far been to, well at least the opening. Users/DavePoole
  That was our Thanks Old Senate for the SWEET drums! rally. :)  Seriously.  They rock.   Users/AllisonEriksen

20070421 19:16:22 nbsp Some of these people played at Herb Schmalenbergers (my grandfather) memorial service in the ARC ballroom in July of 2006, I think they did Sons of California. I think they did a great job, and Im curious to know what they thought about all that and how much background they were given on him. My dad  said he remembered the band playing at football games in the sixties and I think he enjoyed it this time too. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070603 11:40:17 nbsp Ha ha!  Someone moved Dennis to the alumni section prematurely! Users/KateBaker

20070603 13:43:00 nbsp ok ive been reading the history and i still havnt found the answer to a question i have had for a while?  Why is it named banduh.  What is the history behind uh, what does it mean and what does it stand for? Users/MattHh

20070603 18:46:50 nbsp Its on this page under Band what? Users/AllisonEriksen

20070822 16:49:55 nbsp so...to join Banduh we just show up?? its THAT easy?  Users/ArianeMetz

20070822 17:06:02 nbsp YES! You CAN join the CAMB by just showing up to a Monday Night Rehearsal (usually Mondays 79pm in the ARC Ballroom). However, the most fun way to join CAMB is by attending the annual retreat held in the dorms the week before school starts. Anybody interested in joining ought to contact the band manager to see if it is too late to sign up for retreat. Band room phone number: 530.752.6569 or email: join AT camb DOT ucdavis DOT edu. Users/RyanCoates

20090125 19:40:36 nbsp While the band was still allmale but was clearly going to change soon it was introduced, tounge in cheek, at Picnic Day and some games I went to as the Cal Aggie All Male Chavinist Marching Band. I was pretty young then and worried that going coed would mean the end of the band bringing up the rear of the Picnic Day parade wearing boxers playing kazoos. I was happy to see that my concern was unfounded.
  Users/JohnBaker

20090419 18:23:58 nbsp question! I was at the Battle of the Bands this picnic day, an every time the other bands would play something (our fight song, I think?) the Banduh would look all pissed off and sort of flap their hands or wag their fingers in the other bands direction, like screw you guys, just go away. Whats the deal?  Users/LaFrance
  I was there too, and it seemed like they would play their fight song to signal that they had run out of music or time and were going to leave. I think the waving was like waving them goodbye, and to me, at least, it didnt seem like there was any malice behind it. Users/JoePomidor
  I dunno about malice, but there was flashing of the loser sign at the end. I think youre right about the whole fight song / dropping out thing, though, that makes sense. Users/LaFrance

20090506 23:02:04 nbsp Im a member of the Banduh,  and while i cannot speak for the entire band it is my understanding that the wave we do to other schools fight songs is more of a goodbye wave.  At the battle when a band is ready to leave the last song they play is their fight song.  The L sign we make is usually accompanied by shouts of Lame as they are leaving early. As for malice,  this is all usually done in good spirit and has come to be the norm for the Battle of the Bands. Users/ChrisOchoa

20121010 01:37:42 nbsp It seems like there hasnt been any comments about Banduh! since 2009. Let me see... New music, old music, horn movements, going to Retreat, meeting stales, rally formation, Picnic Day parade, Battle of the Bands, San Francisco Chinese New Year Parade, marching football games, attending basketball games, Pajamarino, Save the Music Festival, being a roadie, marching test, away dinner, away trip, getting fitted, freshmen and uppers, instrument rentals, song folders and slits, Monday Night Rehearsals, traditional songs, singing the fight song, perform early, perform late, donuts, carrying ladders, prop building, marching practice, going to sectionals, sending excuses, sectional bondings, electing officers, becoming officers, Monday late night at the DC, meeting new friends, hang out with everybody else, follow traditions, activities, and other secret surprises... Other than going to class, internship, or a parttime job, Banduh! is just a fun time for anybody to join... For me, to be able to be part of Banduh! for less than three years, I always know I should have joined earlier. Proud to be part of it, proud to be an Aggie clarinet. In a certain way, Banduh! defines and creates a space to become more selfconfident, selffulfilling, happiness, enjoyment, and to be part of the school community, in a much committed way. Like a big family, even though you dont need to know everybody... but no matter if anybody is ever going to read this..., I love Banduh! Long live the spirit of happiness. Users/PhilipYip

20140708 02:30:41 nbsp I went to UCD from 19831988, but my dearest memory of the BandUh came in 1992 (I think). That year I was the WEF Quad Stage Manager and asked the BandUh to help me with a little gig and play one song at an ungodly time at a very odd place and in a most unique manner.  The song was White Rabbit.  This was to pay respect to a chance encounter in 1983 when the BandUh came across from friends of mine in the early morning, who were very tired from cleaning up the Quad of the mess of broken straw bales and Decomposed Granite.  You came across those tired students and cheered them up with that song.  I thought it might be nice for you to play that song for us again in 92.  I sent word through an alum named Marie to see if you would be interested thinking maybe a few might be into it.  Much to my surprise I think 75 people volunteered for this late night gig.  It was a beautiful performance and I never really got to thank you all for making one of my most treasured memories.  So to all of you who were in the band in 92, I thank you.  I dont know if anyone is around who remembers, but I do.  You are legends in my mind. Users/PeterMoyes
