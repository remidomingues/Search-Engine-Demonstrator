The California Bicycle Museum looks to be coming a reality, but the location is still to be determined. The museum will house the Pierce Miller Bicycle Collectiona collection spanning 100 yearsthat currently belongs to UCD. The bikes can be viewed http://taps.ucdavis.edu/bicycle/collection/ here.

According to this http://groups.dcn.org/cbm website , those in charge of establishing the museum are applying for nonprofit taxexempt status via the IRS.

There are plans to have the Bike Museum on display in the permanent headquarters of the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, which replaced the Teen Center at Third and B.
  The lower floor of the US Bicycling Hall of Fame has a great collection of bikes, some of which might be from the Pierce Miller Bicycle Collection. Can anyone confirm some if some of the bikes are from this collection? Some, but not all, are. The placards tell. Also, one of the video documentaries they show down there is about moving the Pierce collection out of the barn it was stored in to UC Davis.


 Photos of the Collection 
In October 2004, four bicycles from the collection were on display at the UC Davis Transportation Fair




More photos of the bikes are featured on the back side of the  http://cityofdavis.org/gis/bikemap.pdf official Davis Bike Map.


In May 2005, UC Davis Bicycle Coordinator David TakemotoWeerts gave the Institute of Transportation Engineering students a tour of the entire collection.
