California Duck Days is an annual event held by the Yolo Basin Foundation. It is a Davis Wetlands wetlands festival held annually in February featuring birding field trips and workshops.

California Duck Days, the annual northern California wetlands festival, is held annually at the Department of Fish and Wildlifes Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area Headquarters in South Davis. This familyoriented event is organized by Yolo Basin Foundation and hosted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Duck Days officially begins with a Welcome Reception the Friday prior to the festival, at the Davis Art Center at F St. and Covell Blvd in Davis.
Each year the evening features an outstanding wildlife art exhibit created by the high school students of the Yolo County, as well as a display of California Junior Duck Stamp art. The reception is free and open to the public.


There are over a dozen field trips to sites around the region, such as waterfowl identification, wood duck box building and dog training. There have also been special workshops with live bats and a falconry demonstration in the field. The Duck Days Exhibits have interactive displays from 20 area environmental organizations and features crowdpleasing Mallard ducklings, as well as live raptors. Food is available onsite for purchase.

One of the most popular events at Duck Days is the kids fishing activity. Children may fish for trout in the demonstration wetlands or in a special pond for young children and then have their fish cleaned and packed to take home. There will also be a large mobile aquarium filled with local fish, including many native species, for everyones viewing pleasure.

The cost of the CA Duck Days activities for 2013 is $20 to $25 a person, depending on the number of field trips attended, and children under 16 are FREE when accompanied by an adult. All participants are encouraged to preregister due to limited space on fieldtrips.

Duck Days is held at the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area Headquarters at 45211 County Road 32B in Davis, CA.

20120218 20:16:12 nbsp Hi Constantia, Im forwarding your question to the organizers at Yolo Basin, but I believe you pick up the physical tickets when you check in at the event itself. Let me get your question to the coordinators and Ill let them know that this isnt readily clear! Users/KelseyCondell

20120218 23:41:20 nbsp @ KelseyCondell  Would be great, yeah! I guess we wont receive them through regular (snail) mail anymore (because its next week). There was this possibility to print the receipt, but theres really not much on it (its almost empty). Thanks! Users/ConstantiaOomen
