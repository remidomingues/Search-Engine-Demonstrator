California Hair Design is a Beauty Salons and Barber Shops hair salon owned and operated by Janet Wong. She is the sole stylist.  Most people are happy with their haircuts, but note that she tends to cut a bit shorter than youve asked, so be as specific as you can about the hair length that you want.

One tip is to call the day that you want to go and ask when she is available. That way you can get a haircut and be fairly sure that you wont have to wait for it.

 Prices 
  Men $15
  Women $15, $18 (The price will be different depending on the length of the hair.)
  Color/Perms $?? (It depends.)
  Head & Shoulder Massage $10

20051217 11:30:26 nbsp Ive been going here for 23 years, Janet is nice and takes her time. There is usually a 12 person wait if you dont call in first. Users/AlexGourley

20060604 00:45:29 nbsp Janet is awesome.  Ive been to a few different places in Davis and she is the best.  Ive been going here for over two years now.  Unfortunately she is out of the country until the third week of June. Users/JasonRenteria

20060701 15:13:40 nbsp I get nervous going to places to get my hair trimmed.  I have really long hair and only want a trim, never a full haircut.  Places I have been to in the past (never in Davis) have always screwed up my hair and I leave in near tears.  However Janet did exactly what I wanted, she only trimmed it and trimmed just as much as I told her.  Ill definately return here. Users/JoAnnaRich

20061231 19:20:51 nbsp Very happy with the lady there.  She took me on short notice (seeing as it was Dec. 31st), and there was only about a 10 minute wait, which was perfect for picking out a new hairstyle.  She cut it just like what I saw in the magazine, and she really took her time with it.  My hair is fine and straight, with lots of body, and she layered it beautifully.  Recommended. ) Users/JulieEickhof

20070215 01:39:12 nbsp She has always been consistent in my book, and friendly Users/StevenDaubert

20070812 18:39:40 nbsp Quick appointment, excellent haircut.  What more can you ask? Users/joemorales

20070823 15:52:39 nbsp Janet is very nice and gentle..I have been going their for my eyebrow & lip waxing as she charge only $ 13.00 for both and i think this is the cheapest price I have seen in davis.....I have no complaints...she is good... Users/azizatya

20070904 15:44:39 nbsp I got a pretty good haircut here (if shorter than I had asked for), but manycustomersworth of hair all over the floor and the screaming kids in the back room were a bit offputting. Users/CovertProfessor
  20080720 19:41:00 nbsp A friend of mine talked me into going back, with the suggestion that I make an appointment rather than being a walkin.  My experience was definitely improved  clean floor, kids under control, and again, a nice haircut (much better than I had gotten at the last place Id tried, Angies).  Users/CovertProfessor

20070918 17:13:17 nbsp I went there based on the comments that people wrote. I thought she would do a good job but she completely messed up on my bangs, among other things, by cutting it at least an inch too short when i warned her that my hair was wavy and would shorten. I wont be going there again.  Users/bruinsma

20071013 20:23:44 nbsp I had a sudden urge to get a haircut, so I Davis Wikid all the hair salons in Davis and decided to bring a picture to California Hair Design after making an appointment a mere 1 1/2 hours in advance. For $18, she did a perfect job recreating the hair in the picture. She was also very nice the whole time and paid attention to the details. Im definitely going back. Users/susiekim

20071022 23:22:50 nbsp This was a great experience! Janet was very friendly and did a fabulous job on my hair! I called around 6:20 tonight and she fit me in right away. She cut, washed, and styled my hair for $24. The kids were sweet and adorable. Ive recommended her to my roommate, who is thinking of getting a haircut, and I will definitely go back to Janet for my future cuts. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20071104 16:14:25 nbsp Never again. Im a girl with short hair and she pretty much ruined my hair style. I asked for shorter at the back and pront and some trimming of the rest of my hair. The only thing that ended up looking ok were my bangs. The hair above my ears was barely cut and the top was cut way to short; like an 80s do. I ended up trimming the part obove my ears myself.
Im back to expensive cuts again. Users/CharlotteK

20071108 18:50:59 nbsp My boyfriend, who has no problem going to supercuts, decided to try this place.  It is closer to our place and he could get a consistent person to do his hair.  Well... I have never seen him so mad after a haircut.  The woman, did pretty much everything he asked her not to do.  She refused to listen to him.  He agrees that he should have left as soon as he realized this.  Mind you, he does not have complicated hair or a complicated style.  I cant believe that someone could do a worse job on such short guy hair.  It was even worse growing out. Users/lemurific

20071120 16:39:20 nbsp Janet always gives me a great haircut.  Im a guy with short, wavy hair and she cuts it great every time.  She always pays attention to the details and my hair looks great.  Ive been going to her from her days in Great Clips and stuck with her when she opened this shop. Users/CraigP

20071126 16:42:18 nbsp Exactly what I wanted for only $15.  Fabulous. Users/renaenae83

20080114 23:37:09 nbsp Decent haircut for 15 bucks.  I asked for bangs straight accross, but she did something else, making them thin and wispy.  Recommended if you are cheap like me.   Users/CindyBanh

20080118 16:16:08 nbsp California Hair Design always reminds me of the classic story of two barbers in a small town.  You dont get your haircut in the place with gleaming counters, spotless mirrors and a barber with a meticulous haircut.  You go to the other stylist with the messy shop, counters full of clutter and a dreadful haircut.  After all, who was the one who gave the perfectionist their haircut?

Anyway, Ive found this place a year ago and have gone back 3 times.  Yes, she always cuts shorter than I ask, so Ive learned how to ask for longer than I want.  The key is, Janet does excellent work for this price range in haircuts  (I had a $70 haircut once a decade agoprobably $150 in todays dollarthat was better but I couldnt imagine dropping down that amount of cash every 34 months)  She takes her time, and it shows.  Ive found that a fast cut will look horrid as it grows out; hers age nicely.  There are lots of regular customers for a reason.  Call ahead of time and save a wait. Users/catsndogs

20080208 11:17:12 nbsp The woman here had done my hair really nice when I went in to get 12inches cut off my hair, so I went back again, but that time got a horrible cut that made me look like a Beatles band member.....very unpredictable. Users/tgdavis

20080214 19:34:20 nbsp My family and I have been going to Janet for 23 years and never have been disappointed. She has always been very courteous and professional. Her prices fit in with our budget, with 3 teenagers its a bargain. I would highly recommend Janet to anyone who is looking for a great haircut at a great price. Users/ErnieHernandez

20080428 14:33:39 nbsp If you value the results of your hair cut rather than just the price then DO NOT go here. I was impatient to get my hair cut on a Sunday (most places are closed) so I went here instead. BIG MISTAKE. Not only was the place very dirty, she did a terrible job cutting my hair. All I asked for were some layers and a trim of my bangs. The layers turned out incredibly choppy and uneven. Certain spots have a 3 inch gap between the next layer! Then, she cut my bangs by holding them above my head! They ended up WAY too short and I dont know how she did it they turned out LAYERED as well! Ive been constantly pulling my bangs and hair back. It is going to take a long time to fix the damage that was done! Users/Kelli

20080509 15:03:16 nbsp Wow!  I just got my hair cut today, and I love it!  This is the third salon Ive tried since moving to Davis and the only one Ive been happy with.  I have straight, baby fine hair, that comes to about 6 below my shoulders. I told her I wanted to keep the length, but put in some layers on the top to give it body, and cut into a V at the back, since it tends to all hang forward. She did exactly that...it has so much body and falls around my face and shoulders in a flattering way.  I would say that for $18 you cant do better, but I was so unhappy with my $60 haircut earlier this year, that Id have to say you just cant do better, period!    Users/JuliePalmer

20080509 16:17:47 nbsp I just went in for a simple haircut. For the price, she did an excellent job. Users/ThomasAnastasio

20080607 15:34:36 nbsp I went in for a trim, she took off more than I wanted, but I really needed it! It came out perfect...for 18 dollars, I like it much better than other places Ive paid 50 at.  Users/bluemoon

20080628 19:52:32 nbsp I am in tears!  I hate my hair!  I dont know what Janet was thinking.  My hair looks nothing like the picture I showed her!  I wanted a typical Acut with the back saved hi and angled toward the front with some stylish bangs.  I got a hair cut that looks like someone grandmothers F%$ing wig!  Ive got layers on top of my head about 2 in.  I dont know why I have layers since it should be just a straight bob with cut bangs.  But Nooo.. even the bangs are Fed up!  Thanks a lot people who recommended her!  Im screwed for the next 6 months! Users/christine.davis

20080917 07:22:42 nbsp I have never had a bad experience here, and for about $8 more, she will give you a thorough head, shoulder, and neck massage when your haircut is over. Happy with the hair, and feel more relaxed upon leaving. Best  $20+ I could spend at any barbershop/salon. Users/DCWine

20080923 16:04:31 nbsp I had my hair cut last night by Janet and although I didnt particularly like the way she styled it, I am super happy with the cut! She was also very careful to ask if the amount she was trimming off was okay with me. She took her time and was very focused (unlike a lot of other salons where your stylist will be on the phone etc.) It cost me $18 and I am planning on going back to her for my next cut.  Users/dds1372

20080929 16:03:30 nbsp I was looking to get my hair trimmed on short notice, so I came here since Janet was able to schedule an appointment for me right away. When I first arrived, I was quite taken aback at the condition of the interior  it was dirty, messy, and rundown looking, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I told Janet what I wanted, but I dont know if she understood me too well because my haircut didnt come out at all like I wanted it to. She cut way more off than I wanted and the layers she cut were far too short. I ended up wearing my hair up everyday for quite some time after getting this haircut until the layers grew out. She also cut my hair straight across the back (rather than a Vshape) and it looked pretty uneven to me afterward. She definitely took her time, but I didnt like the result very much. It wasnt a truly awful experience, but it wasnt a good one either. I suppose you get what you pay for. Overall, I wouldnt recommend California Hair Design and I definitely wont be going back. Users/LisaNicole

20081001 17:19:21 nbsp fantastic, i was totally suprised that a fobby asian could give such a great haircut.  followed the picture perfectly, best haircut ive ever gotten for 12 bucks Users/rvmazzol

20081012 12:18:07 nbsp I made an appointment and was able to get in about an hour after calling.  I was very pleased with my haircut and with the price of $12.  The place was clean and Janet was nice.  Ill be going back. Users/DataPoint

20081015 20:43:11 nbsp IF you have wavy or curly hair NEVER EVER IN HERE.  I told her to only take off half an inch and she completely ruined my hair.  She has no concept about the fact that curly hair shrinks up. Instead of cutting HALF an inch she chopped off a whole three and a half inches off.  I left in tears she took my long hair from me. My hair was to the middle of my back and she was only purpose to trim half an inch. NOW when it curls up my hair comes just below my shoulders. IF YOUR HAIR IS CURLY OR WAVY STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I read through all the other comments here and it looks like im the 4th person w/ curly hair that has had her hair screwed up at this place... Not to mention those with wavy curly hair who didnt comment. Users/vivalaLuLu

20081210 09:55:12 nbsp Joan is great...she does a good haircut for cheap. Watch out though, if she sells you the beard trim it is NOT included in the price but is another $7 for 2 minutes work. CHD also does GREAT alterations to garments when Joans mom is around! Alterations are very reasonable and professionallooking! Users/YesItsMe

20091007 12:57:11 nbsp I have been going to Janet for 5 years or so  perfect every time! Thanks, Janet! Users/KB95616

20100301 13:27:07 nbsp WAYYY BETTER THAN SOME CHAINSTORE CUTTER. I have medium length wavy hair so its easy to tell whether Ive gotten a good cut or not. Found this place on the wiki and went. My heart sank a little when after I thought I thoroughly explained howd I want my hair, she pointed at the hairmodel poster above (dated like early 19 ninety something) and said you want that?. But after another detailed elaboration to make myself clear she went right to it. SUPER FRIENDLY and talkative and the cut came out great. Shes got an itchy scissor finger to cut short so make sure you tell her EXACTLY how much you want off and where. Users/shredDaVeTown

20100309 16:28:24 nbsp I thought I had left a comment here ages ago, but apparently not.  Ive been going to California Hair Design for 3 or 4 years now and havent gone anywhere else since I first checked it out.  Janet is great.  While the prices have gone up (they were $8 for a mens cut when I started going), theyre still no higher than most of the budget cutters.  Janet takes her time with the cuts and is very thorough.  This is a good thing, though; my haircut is consistently clean and neat.  Im a big fan.

And, yes, make an appointment.  It can be a hassle if you dont. Users/TomGarberson

20100425 14:33:21 nbsp Went here today. Loved it! Users/Adalwolf

20100414 16:30:00 nbsp I agree, she does cut off more than you ask...but I love the way it turned out and only $15! Thanks! Superamazing

20100521 20:51:48 nbsp Decent haircuts twice. She did cut much more than I asked one time, but Ill be going back.. Just be careful to watch her and be careful explaining what you want.  Also: do not make appointments. It is meant to be walkin only I think.  I made an appointment that she proceeded to write on a piece of mail that had just come in, and when I went back I came 5 minutes early and she sat someone else when I told her I was there for an appointment. After assuring it would be only a few minutes, 25 minutes later I was seated.

Just walkin and be careful watching that she cuts what you ask. Users/redbike

20101002 15:51:23 nbsp She took off more than I wanted and I now look like someone who would wear camouflage pants in the summer. Shes very nice though. But I did find it strange that she offers shoulder massages for 10 dollars haha.  Users/Davekhuh

20101203 22:28:12 nbsp I came in as a walk in today around 2pm, and she was in the middle of working on a clients hair, so she asked me to come back at 3pm. I did and 25 minutes later was very pleased with my haircut! Im pretty easy to please concerning my hairdo, so I just let her know I wanted to keep it as long and healthy as possible.  Users/JuliaRoseFurman

20110315 21:10:39 nbsp By Far, the best hair cut place in town. I have been going there for 2+ years and I get compliments on the hair cut. Highly Recommended. She is super nice, skilled, and attentive.  Users/KevinW

20111003 22:39:22 nbsp I thought the lady came across kind of rude and awkward. Didnt really care for the cut and do not recommend returning here! Users/aaron.smith

20111015 11:59:56 nbsp I cant recommend this place.  Its kind of dirty/messy in there and she cuts your hair shorter than you ask her to.  Also, her clippers are very loud and the noise is uncomfortable when shes working around your ears.  She did, however, do a precise job.   Users/LeTigre

20111211 19:18:48 nbsp Absolutely terrible!!!! I went here today on a whim, because it was the only place open on a Sunday. The stylist was nice and seemed to understand that I wanted JUST A TRIM. However, she cut extremely short layers. I used to have very long hair, and now it is just past my shoulders with jagged awkward looking chin length layers. It looks like a pseudo mullet. I cried the entire way home. It will most likely take about a year to grow out, and Ill be looking awful in the meantime. Do your self a favor and DO NOT COME HERE. You will most likely regret it, since the woman cant even understand simple directions.  Users/shomes

20130223 16:18:32 nbsp Just tried here for the first time and it turned out great! The lady is very nice and genuine. Some comments suggest she doesnt like to talk much, but if you are a respectful customer she is warmly welcoming and thankful. Users/MrNoitall

20140402 15:51:31 nbsp Ive been letting Janet cut my hair for about 13 years and have always been pleased with what she does.  She is one of the few people who cuts my hair the way I ask her to.  She gets it right.
