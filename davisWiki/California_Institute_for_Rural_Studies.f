 Mission Statement 
Our mission is to work toward a rural California that is socially just, economically viable, and environmentally balanced.  Each of these elements is integral to the larger goal of Sustainability sustainable development.  As a nonprofit Research & Development research organization, we are committed to pursuing these longterm goals through sound empirical research that is directly relevant to progressive social change.  While our commitment to the scientific method is at the foundation of our credibility, we recognize the inescapable role that values play in shaping the fundamental questions that researchers pose.  Our philosophy of science is therefore based on the principle that scientific inquiry should consciously serve the longterm public interest.
