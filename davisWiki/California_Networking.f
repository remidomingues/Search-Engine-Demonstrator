California Networking appears to have taken over the location once occupied by D Z Solutions, a company that was equally mysterious.  Listings elsewhere on the interwebs seem to indicate that theyre called California Networking (you probably already figured that one out), that theyre located in Davis (if youre good, you got that one, too!), and that they focus on billing services (GOTCHA!).  Not sure how strong a connection there is between networking and billing services, but there you have it.
