California Polytechnic State University, or CAL POLY (sometimes referred to lovingly by alumni as Cow Poly) is a 4 year University in the CSU System. This CSU is one of the highest regarded Cal States in California. Like Davis, it competes in the Great West for Football (and moving with UCD to the Big Sky in 2012). In most other sports, Cal Poly competes with UC Davis in the Big West Conference. It is a MAJOR rival of UC Davis in football. UCD faces off against Cal Poly at home in odd numbered years when the Causeway Classic is away (@ Sac State). The rivalry with UCD is known as the Battle for the Golden Horseshoehttp://www.aggiepack.com/pages/football/goldenhorseshoe.htm. Through the 2011 season, the Aggies lead Cal Poly in the trophy series (since 2004) 53. The rivalry has been in place much longer, with UC Davis leading 19162 after the 2011 contest. But the Golden Horseshoe trophy was first awarded in 2004. Sac State is our primary rival in all sports, but UCD is Cal Polys number 1 rival. No Cal Poly team that loses to Davis gets to have their team photo in the locker roomhttp://theaggie.org/article/2010/11/15/footballaggiestakehomethegoldenhorseshoe. Both teams have played in the same conference for the past few years.

On November 5, 2011 Cal Poly lost to UC Davis 2417, giving UC Davis a three year winning streak in the Battle for the Golden Horseshoe.

Aside from Sports, Cal Poly is located in San Luis Obispo, halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Like Davis, it is a college town. Both schools are agricultural and have similar sports mascots. UC Davis is officially named the Aggies and Cal Poly is officially the Mustangs. However, our mascot Gunrock is a mustang. Both schools are competitive and are considered selective institutions.

On Saturday, March 12th, 2011 Cal Poly and UC Davis met in the Big West Tournament Final for Womens Basketball in Anaheim. UC DAVIS defeated the Mustangs and is the first UC Davis team (Mens or Womens) to go to the NCAA Division I Basketball tournament.
