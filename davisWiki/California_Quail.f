The California Quail (Callipepla californica) is our State Bird!  It is a plump bird that hangs out it big groups mostly under bushes.  When you scare them, they scare the crap out of you.  The whole covey bursts out their hiding spot unexpectedly and hurriedly flies off leaving you to calm down and catch your breath.  During spring and summer, they can be seen in family groups with little fluff balls, which are the kids. The male is distinguished by his large black feather on his head which curves down over his face.  If you want to see one of these guys, try the Putah Creek Picnic Area
