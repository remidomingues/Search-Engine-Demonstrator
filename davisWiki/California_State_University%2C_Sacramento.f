wiki:sacramento:California State University Sacramento California State University, Sacramento are our rivals across Yolo Causeway the causeway. Founded in 1947 as Sacramento State College,  on the current site of Sacramento City College Sacramento City College , and later moved to its current 300 acre campus (between Highway 50, Howe Avenue and the American River). It was officially given university status (and its current name) in 1972.

The rivalry is played out annually through the Causeway Classic football game. The Banduh takes the rivalry quite seriously and is known to wear shirts like http://daviswiki.org/Funny_Bumper_Stickers?actionFiles&doview&targetcsussucs.jpg this one. Saying Sac State around a Banduh nerd is likely to trigger the exclamation SUCKS!  The UC Davis Football team was undefeated against the Sac State Hornets from 1999 (the same year that Prince reached his partying climax) through 2007. The Aggies humiliated the Hornets  3016 in 2006 and won 3126 in 2007. However, the Hornets have won the last two contests, winning 2919 in 2008 in the inaugural Causeway Classic game at Aggie Staduim. They lost in 2009, in heartbreaking fashion at Hornet Staduim. The Aggies had a lead for nearly the whole game, then completely fell apart late. The final was 3128 in favor of Sac State. In 2010, the Aggies beat Sac State 1716 after a 47 minute lightning delay at halftime.

For the Fall 2005 semester, CSUS had 27,932 Students (82% Undergraduate), ranging from 1384 years of age; with a median age of 23. http://www.oir.csus.edu/Students/QuickFact/Fall2005.cfm More statistics can be found here.


While commonly referred to as Sac State and Sacramento State University, California State University, Sacramento is its official name. The University president had been trying to officially change it, but dropped the issue due to campus resistance in March of 2005.  However, he asked for the media to refer to it as Sacramento State. On Sept. 1, the university unveiled its first http://www.csus.edu/news/090105newlogo.stm official logo, with the Sacramento State branding, further adding to the naming confusion.
