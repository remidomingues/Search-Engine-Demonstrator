The UC Davis chapter of California Student Sustainability Coalition (commonly referred to as the CSSC) is a student led organization that is part of the larger, statewide CSSC. We have chapters at University of California UC, CSU, Community Colleges community college and even private university campuses across the state. It is our mission to unite and empower the California community of higher education to collaboratively and nonviolently transform ourselves and our institutions based on our inherent social, economic, and ecological responsibilities. The CSSC creates and endorses campaigns that span many university campuses in California. This power in numbers gives substantial weight to our work that has resulted in significant impacts since our conception in 2003.

 Our Objectives

     http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid43433883541 The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF)
                 The Green Initiative Fund The Green Initiative is a student powered initiative which strives to promote sustainable development at UC Davis. TGIF would add $4 to student fees to create a fund endorsing projects in areas reaching from education to physical structures on campus.  At UC Davis, this would create a fund of about $200,000 that would be available to community innovators like you! This initiative will be on the Winter 2009 ballot. To pass, 20% of undergraduate students must vote and 60%+1 must vote yes. Join the cause and show your commitment to sustainability.
