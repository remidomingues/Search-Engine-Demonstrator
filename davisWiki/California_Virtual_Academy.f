The http://www.caliva.org California Virtual Academies is a network of tuitionfree public charter schools that gives parents the curriculum, tools, and support they need to deliver a highquality, wellrounded education to their children. In partnership with credentialed teachers, parents are able to become highly involved with their childrens education by guiding them through our curriculum.

CAVA is available to Davis families who wish to homeschool their children in a virtual school setting.  Please see the above link for a more complete description.
