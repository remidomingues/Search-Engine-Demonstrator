(We all have certain things we look for in churches and sadly one church doesnt fit all) but dont let that discourage you. This is a wonderful little church. The staff is nice and you can really feel the love there. If youre looking for a cute, small loving church that, is a worship power house then this is it. They also have a cool student service on Friday nights. Checked it out a few times. Hope this was helpful :) Users/Dozer
