My name is Calvin Ly. I am currently a 3rd year at UC Davis who is attempting to get a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. So far my college years have been mostly studying. There are time when I would hang out with friends to eat or join them in events such as Picnic day. Overall I spent most of my time studying for my classes.  I consider this more of a science community, this probably because I have only met science majors rather than the other fields of study. I spend the majority of the time in study groups for my science classes. Hopefully with the degree I can go to medical school or study some sort of Ph. D curriculum. Ultimately, I wish to do medical teaching because I enjoy helping others. Also I love to teach others because it is satisfying to watch people learn.

Since it will be a while before I can make those ambitions reality, I indulge myself in other hobbies. I enjoy reading historic novels, military stratagems and medical related articles. Such titles that I have read are the Three Kingdoms, Illiad and The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Most of the medical articles that I have read were on diseases of all sorts especially regarding cardiovascular or neurobiology. Also I enjoy working out by playing sports. There is no particular sport that I hate to play. I just like to play because it is healthy and fun.  Another thing I also enjoy doing is helping others in the science course work such as organic chemistry or biochemistry.
