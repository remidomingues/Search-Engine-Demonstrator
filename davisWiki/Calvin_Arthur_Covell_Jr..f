Cal Covell was a native of Buckeye Township, northeast of Winters. His father came across the plains in a covered wagon in Davis Timeline/1850 1857, and ten years later moved to Yolo County. Cal was one of the original proponents of city incorporation, was instrumental in setting up a high school in Davisville, and helped bring the University of California campus here. He farmed during most of his life and had holdings north of County Road 31 (subdivided as Covell Park). He was also a butcher at Harbys Meat Market on G Street. His last home was at 329 F Street, and the home since razed. In 1905 he became the second husband of Dollie Tufts (18631943), daughter of Joshua B. and Mary Ann Tufts. Cal died at 12:32am, January 8, 1969, at the ripe old age of 93 in the Davis Convalescent Hospital.  Freemasonry Masonic funeral services were held January 10 at 2pm in the Davis Funeral Chapel. His sole surviving heir was grandson Frank P. Liggett of Davis.

You may recognize his last name as one of the main Covell Boulevard streets of Davis.
