20080923 17:53:56 nbsp I have lived in Davis now for over 5 years.  I have lived in many places.  Cambridge House Apartments is by far the best place I have lived while in Davis.  I love to come home and have free internet and free cable that is easy to access.  The office managers a very easy to work with and the maintenance gets things done in a timely manner.  If my printer craps out and I have a paper due, I can easily print my needed class materials in the study lounge.  The location is great, and I feel safe here being minutes from the police department.  Thanks guys, keep up the hard work! Users/beebeewoof

20100122 14:51:24 nbsp I moved your question to Wiki help. Users/WilliamLewis

20100527 16:20:24 nbsp I restored some of the information that you deleted from the Cambridge House Apartments page, but left the updated pricing information and specials.  Some of what you removed is relevant to the community, both when deciding whether to live there and in deciding how to approach the lease signing (questions to ask and whatnot). Users/TomGarberson

20100830 13:22:42 nbsp Thanks for your input over on the /talk page.  William Lewis emailed the guy who left the comment, so hopefully hell follow up with the agreement you guys worked out. Users/TomGarberson
