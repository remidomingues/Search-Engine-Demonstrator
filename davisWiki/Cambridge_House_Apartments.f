Our one bedrooms start at $1000, two bedrooms start at $1175.00, and three bedrooms start at $1675.00. No matter what though, these will not be the rates you pay. You must also add in trash water and sewage fees, patio fees if you have one, washer/dryer fees if you have these and other various fees that are not explicitly stated here. Rent is prorated and that is confirmed by managementInsisting on a prorated amount for a partial month is well within your rights. Management has noted in the comments below that they will accept quarterly payments (pay for 3 months at a time) and other alternative payment schedules. Just be sure you discuss it with them beforehand to work out the details, and as with anything where a lot of money is involved, get it in writing. The complex is less than 1 mile from the UC Davis campus. The complex is two blocks from a stop for the L bus line L line and within one block from the A bus line A line, M bus line M line, and P/Q bus line P/Q line.

All units have heating and air conditioning in the form of wall units with two additional vents throughout the apartment. The kitchens have refrigerators/freezers, gas ranges, cabinetmounted microwaves, and dishwashers, but the sinks do not have garbage disposals. There are chandeliers, so you might not need to use all your lamps. The one and two bedroom units feature vanities separate from the bathrooms. Some units have an option for a washer and dryer. Otherwise, you can use either of the two onsite coinops laundromat, which are always open. Depending on the unit, you might get a balcony. There is emergency maintenance available 24/7. Management is available from 8:00 AM 5:30 PM MF, 10 AM 4 PM Saturday and closed Sunday.

Water/sewer/trash is not included in the price above, however it is charged on a flat fee basis. The community has a clubhouse with a swimming pool; a BBQ area; a 24hour weight rooms fitness center; a 24hour internet cafe; and a game room with pool, ping pong and air hockey, and a plasma TV. The management throws BBQs on occasion and hosts a yearly Davis Neighbors Night Out BBQ where they hold games, tournaments, and give out prizes.

The apartment is part of Harold Grinspoons real estate empire that has built him a ninefigure net worth. It is managed by Aspen Square Management, on behalf of Crescent Davis Limited Partnership (operating out of Massachusetts) whose sole partner is NEPSA 1996 Properties Investors, Inc (a Massachusetts corporation), which seems to have something to do with NEPSA Properties Investors, Inc (another Massachusetts corporation) and NEPSA Capital, Inc (yet another Massachusetts corporation). Harold Grinspoon is president of all of these corporations and founder of Aspen Square Management. Got all that?

20130126 12:27:23 nbsp Ive lived here for six months.  Its okay; walls are paper thin and windows to bedrooms are right next to the parking lot, so it can get loud.  I thought that the service was great, UNTIL THIS WEEKEND.  My pilot light has gone out repeatedly, and did again on Friday.  I had to call twice before they came to relight it, then when I went to dinner, it went out again and I came home to a cold apartment with my 7yearold daughter.  I called the 24 hour emergency maintenance number and was told he wasnt coming out at night.  So I called again this morning, and he informed me that he wasnt coming at all this weekend, and then proceeded to call me a lazy woman for not calling while the office was open Friday.  Except, I did call Friday and Ive asked way before this that the heater from 1971 be replaced.  You may be asking yourself why I dont just light it myself?  Because the heater is so old, its covered in filth and the directions about how to light the pilot have completely worn off the plate they were printed on.  So basically, Cambridge House has left me, and my child, in the winter for two or more days with no heat because the maintenance staff cant be bothered to light a pilot, and theyre calling me lazy?

 3/24/13  This place still sucks and it just keeps getting worse.  While I find the office staff, and most of the maintenance crew, to be very pleasant, this building needs a total overhaul or teardown.  I can hear EVERYTHING my upstairs neighbor does.  EVERYTHING, especially at 3am when shes rocking the floorboards.  Sure, laundry in your apartment is nice, until your neighbors do it at midnight.  And that heater I mentioned above?  They fixed it because it kept going out.  I had PG&E come out to look at the heater.  The nice PG&E man showed me how they had not fixed it so much as Jerryrigged it in such a way that could have caused a fire in my apartment.  After I notified management, they told me they would replace the heater.  It took two weeks and I can say they were clean and out of my hair.  But then they left and never turned the thing on, so Im still running an electric heater.  And the single pane windows that show where theyve been previously priedopen (allowing flies to come in), the torn and crumbling weather stripping on the door, and the lack of sunshine into any window due to the placement of my apartment keeps the apartment freezing.  That was great in the summer, but even today, 65 outside, we were freezing.  Honestly, its disgusting what they get away with charging us for this place.  Beware, what you see in the model apartment is NOT what youll be moving into.  Im counting the days until Im free from this place and Im going with a rental agent next time.
As for towing, they do tow, my BF got towed on night while he was inside for one hour.  But they dont have someone onsight every night to be the official person to call for the tow, residents cannot call for someone to be towed, it has to be management.  So they tow, but not on weekends.


20130128 08:52:17 nbsp Ive lived here for about 6 months, and I would say from negative reviews, its really a pretty nice place. I have no problems with hearing neighbors being too loud (I hear them occasionally, but its an apartment and I have realistic expectations  theyre never disruptive). The management has responded quickly and politely to every problem Ive had. The paint layers are rather thick, but I havent had any problems with the quality degrading or anything like that. This is the kind of apartment that is what you make of it. The fitness room is pretty small, but rarely full, so I cant really complain unless it starts getting more crowded. The parking is a problem at night, but street parking is easily available if I get home too late, so its really not a crisis like some people make it sound. They DO tow (my friend got towed, so I can verify that), so dont listen to reviews saying they dont tow. In fact, I recommend paying attention to the signs that it is for residents only (this may be new). All said, I feel like while it may not be a perfect place, you can find flaws anywhere. Im really quite happy here. Its certainly worth checking out.

20130128 nbsp Honest Truth Be careful, this place really is too good to be true. Upon starting my experience with Cambridge, events just spiraled downhill. Although we may be the exception, all of these things happened within only 56 months of living in Cambridge; They rented out our leased apartment to someone else!! After signing the lease and being assigned to a specific apartment, Cambridge rented that same apartment to someone else!!! We only found out when we went in to check a wall color sample and they tried pulling our file. The entire stay and Cambridge our lease was set for a completely different apartment. Didnt install washer and dryer before we moved in, so the first 2 weeks we were under construction. Days after that our kitchen sink sprung a leak and destroyed items under the sink. It was replaced promptly by the only upside to the entire complex, Maintenance was always great. Our air conditioner groaned and was very loud, but they would not replace it. My energy bill was $400 for the month of August with running the AC. JUST BY ELIMINATING THE AC as a trial run, my bill for September was only $70. Cambridge didnt feel that this horribly old AC was the problem.... yea, okay. Sink backed up a couple months later, ruining most items in the bathroom sink area, deduction was instated, but was an annoying situation. Asked if we should have the apartment carpets professionally cleaned, was told no, and now stuck with paying for all new carpets. Depressed, disappointed, just want you all to know our unfortunate situation. The newest staff has been absolutely wonderful and helped us get out as soon as they could, but our personal experience was ridiculous, and I would never consider living there again...Users/Cznark

20130222 19:03:05 nbsp I have lived at this complex for almost two years and it sucks. I can hear my upstairs neighbors every move. The staff will call you repetivly for the same thing because they dont communicate. OH!! and even though you may be paying 1700 dollars a month dont think they will bother to send a maintance person out on a friday to fix your heater. Nope you have to wait all weekend in February and freeze your ass off before they fix it. Apparently a broken heater isnt considered an emergency and can wait. Also my apartment in general is a shitty. Not worth the 1700 dollars we pay. It wad dirty when we moved in. They nasty track carpet and the whole place really needed to be redone long ago. Never again will I be fooled by the models they have to see.It is nothing like what you get. They paint over everything... even the bath tub!! not worth the money I promise. OH and the laudry rooms. The washers are nasty with mold where the soap goes, no one ever cleans them. OH you want to dry your clothes? good luck getting on that works half of them wont dry properly. keep looking people... the only plus is nice maintenance workers, allowing pets and a cool pool.

20130419 08:54:51 nbsp If you want parking when you come home at night, look elsewhere. Its common to get back past 10pm and find that, despite your permit, the only parking is street parking. (And street parking has its own regulations.) Heck, last night it was near impossible to drive through the parking lot because all the fire zone space was used as parking. Normally Ill see one or two cars in a fire zone, but not... all the zone space. Theres no way to report it. Were moving out for price v. quality, etc, but I think the parking grated on me the most while I was here. Bring a bike with heavy duty locks and youll be fine. (Bike theft is common here, and you wont always find outdoor parking for your bike. Youll bring it into your apt sometimes.) Users/Kata
