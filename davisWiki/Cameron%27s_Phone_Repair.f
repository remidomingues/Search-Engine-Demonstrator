Camerons Phone Repair is a miniature phone repairing business managed by Cameron Do. Cameron is a currently a student at UC Davis who fixes phones as a side job. He specializes in screen repair mainly for iPhones. He is also more than happy to do color conversions to change the color of your iPhone for that unique look, just email him to see if it can be done. Cameron may be able to repair other smartphone screens if you email him. The current prices for repair jobs are:


Cameron sets himself apart from commercial phone repair businesses by putting customers over profit margins. While other businesses like RC iPhone Repair may charge a ridiculous $70 to repair an iPhone 4 screen, he prefers to set highly competitive prices to appeal to the college consumer base.

 Camerons Personal Projects 
  Camerons first exposure to the world of electronic repair was when he dropped and cracked his iPod Touch 4th gen as a junior in high school. Like most people who has ever broken an electronic, he was devastated. Determined to fix his iPod, he looked up ways to get his iPod fixed. Unhappy with the expensive prices businesses offered, he took matters into his own hands. He saw that replacing the screen himself was in the realm of possibility, so he ordered the new screen and successfully performed the repair. Cameron was also dedicated to promise to his friend to always wear pink, so he chose to give his iPod Touch a pink screen. Since then, he performed numerous iPod Touch repairs for his friends.

  Fast forward to about midway through his senior year in high school, Camerons sister destroyed her Samsung Galaxy SIIs screen by throwing it against a wall because she was extremely angry with her roommate (maybe some of you can relate). The screen could not function at all, unable to show even a pixel of light. Although this job required a different set of steps to follow, Cameron managed to replace the screen and the phone later became his daily driver.


  Camerons last personal project is with an iPhone 4. Before heading off to college at UC Davis, he purchased a white cracked iPhone 4 from eBay. Once again loyal to the promise he made to his friend to always wear pink, he bought a pink screen and pink battery cover. He switched out the screen and battery cover, and became a proud owner of a pink iPhone. Legend has it that he still uses the pink iPhone.
