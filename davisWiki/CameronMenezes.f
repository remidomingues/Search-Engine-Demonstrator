No problem.  One thing that would help you a good deal is to use asterisks instead of double dashes.  Then the wiki will automatically indent your comment and make it much easier to follow replies.  Ideally, if you have something to add to that entry, just edit the main text of the entry itself rather than adding a comment.   Users/JabberWokky jw
