Just a note about the tire levers you mentioned about at my shop, APEX Cycles, we will replace the lever for free for life (No other shop does that.).  Also, a portion of the profits goes to Breast Cancer research, hence the Pink color, the Yellow ones go to Lance Armstrongs Livestrong foundation, Orange goes to Davis Community Meals, and the green ones go to IMBA (International Mtn. Bike Association) to improve local riding trails.  I used to have a sign up explaining this, but it got messed up and I never got back to printing a new one.  We do have cheaper levers (Black) for $2.99 to $4.99 based on quality.  Just ask.  Thanks for stopping by. Users/Aaron.Curtin
