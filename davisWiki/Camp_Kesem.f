 History 
Camp Kesem National, a countrywide nonprofit organization, provides UC Davis with the tools they need to establish successful, selfsustaining Camp Kesem programs.

Freshmen Flo and Users/NilaGurusinghe Nila initiated the Camp Kesem program at UC Davis in fall of 2004.

The $10,000 budget of the 2005 camp was secured through the fundraising efforts and leadership genius of Anne Baldwin, a devoted number of Camp Kesem officers, and the kind monetary and inkind contributions of students friends and family, Davis community members, and local businesses. Only with the generous support of all listed above could Camp Kesem at UC Davis achieve their goal of providing kids a safe place to meet other kids facing the same issues of life and death at home.

 Why Kids Need Kesem 
Kids with parents who are cancer patients have their lives turned upside down. The family structure and routine is disrupted in just about every aspect by the demands of the illness and treatment, states Dr. Michael Amylon, Oncologist. The needs of children who have a parent with cancer are often overshadowed by the crisis of the parents illness. These children are forced to find their own ways to cope with complex emotions that result from their situation. Often, the coping methods these children develop on their own are unhealthy, which leads to emotional and social challenges during childhood and beyond.

These include:

  Isolation
  Disempowerment
  Helplessness
  Loss of Sense of Control
  Fear
  Anxiety
  Stress
  Anger
  Guilt
  Experience of Loss (loss of life before cancer in the family)
  Isolation
  Depression
  Withdrawal
  Decreased SelfEsteem
  Lack of Feelings of Normalcy

Camp Kesem provides a supportive environment in which children can express their emotions in safe and healthy ways. Children gain coping tools they can use at home, at school, and wherever they face challenges in life. At Camp Kesem, these children are no longer alone, every child at camp knows what its like to have a parent with cancer. The peer support and friendships formed at camp provide hope and strength well beyond the week of camp.
