Camp Putah is one of the many City of Davis municipal camps of Davis. There are actually three Camp Putah Camps.

 Camp Putah I  Pathfinders
 Pathfinders sticks to the original version of Camp Putah.  It is a week long day camp, with an overnight stay on Thursday night.  It is full of adventures and activities for kids, including archery, paddling canoeing, crafts, and hikes.  Campers learn about natural wildlife and ecosystems in Central California.  The camp meets up is at Central Park every morning and campers bike to the camp site at the Putah Creek Picnic Area.  The Thursday overnight portion typically includes a trip to the Rocknasium, swimming at Community Pool, dinner at Westwood Park, a parent presentation with skits, a campfire, and a night hike.

 Camp Putah II  Explorers
 Explorers is an updated version of Camp Putah that ventures to areas beyond Davis city limits.  Similar to Pathfinders, it is also a day camp with a Thursday overnight.  The 2007 schedule ran a trip to Lake Natoma and Folsom for kayaking and geocaching on Monday, a hike in Georgetown on Tuesday, a museum trip to  wiki:sf San Fransisco on Wednesday, and an overnight in http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id505 D.L. Bliss State Park in Lake Tahoe South Lake Tahoe on Thursday.

Camp Putah II  Explorers has been eliminated due to the 09/10 Budget approved by City Council

 Camp Putah III  Trekkers
 Trekkers is a full, fourday trip version of Camp Putah.  2007 trips included Yosemite National Park, wiki:wikipedia:Big Sur, and wiki:sf San Fransisco.



 Backpacking
 Although not one of the three Camp Putah camps, the City of Davis Community Services Department offers a Backpacking Camp as part of its Outdoor Education program     (CPI, CPII, CPIII, Backpacking, Horse Camp and Extreme Adventures make up the Outdoor Education program).  Trips are MondayThursday and are led by experienced guides.  Participants learn survival skills, wilderness ethics, selfsufficiency and build confidence, all away from the distractions of civilization.  In 2007, camp took place in Emigrant Wilderness, Hoover Wilderness, John Muir Wilderness, and Lassen Volcanic National Park.  For Summer 2008, trips include Hoover, John Muir, Ansel Adams and Ventana Wilderness.  In 2009, campers went to Hoover and John Muir Wildernesses. The last trip in Summer 2009 was canceled due to budget cuts.

Camp is open to children entering 6th10th grades.
