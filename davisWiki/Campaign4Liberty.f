lulz, a libertarian group in Davis? Youll never last. Users/hankim



Okay, in a slightly friendlier vein (and anything would be, wow!):  Welcome to the wiki!  We value the input of individuals here, so we try to encourage individual responsibility and accountability by asking that people edit using their own name (preferred!) or a pseudonym (if they feel its absolutely necessary).  Its great to have a new viewpoint on the wiki, and I hope you stick around and contribute to more than just the Campaign for Liberty entry.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
