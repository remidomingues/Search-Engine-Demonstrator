Local Campgrounds and Campsites



  http://www.yolocounty.org/generalgovernment/generalgovernmentdepartments/parks/parksrelatedinformation/cachecreekregionalparkcampground Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park is a decent spot, about an hour drive from Davis.  Theres a good deal of wildlife roaming around including many wild Turkeys turkey and waterfowl.  Facilities are simple but not rustic.  Swimming (at your own risk) in the river.  There are 25 sites available on a first come first serve basis and 20 sites available by reservation only, as well as four group sites. It is fairly empty during winter and spring, but pretty crowded during summer and fall.  Campsite rental is http://www.yolocounty.org/generalgovernment/generalgovernmentdepartments/parks/parksrelatedinformation/cachecreekregionalparkcampground expensive at $25 per night, and there are additional fees for dogs, extra cars, and other things. Each site has a firepit with water faucets nearby.  If you go there, the campsite is  easy to miss so keep an eye out for the roadsigns as you will likely drive right past it.  The campsite itself isnt anything special but the surrounding canyon is quite stunning.

About a mile upstream of the county camp site the land is managed by the BLM and primitive camping is allowed without a permit or fee. Theres a decent flat area at the  confluence of Bear Creek and Cache Creek that is convenient for primitive car camping and popular for launching kayaks.

You can also try http://www.koa.com KOA, which is camping for people who dont do camping.  They tend to be mediocre, if you are used to camping at a decent state park for instance, but have facilities that many smaller state parks lack.  In general though, they are to be avoided as they attract loud groups of annoying and sometimes Shadiness Factor shady people.  KOA isnt for people who are looking for a destination, they are for people who need a place to stay immediately and dont want to spend the money on a hotel room.

You can find http://www.davislifemagazine.com/2010/07/letsgocamping/ tips to better your camping experience in a July 2010 blog post from Davis Life Magazine. There are many places in Northern California that provide adequate campgrounds and camping is an especially fun activity to engage in during the summer.

Another site for general camping tips is http://www.ndparks.com ND Parks  Directory of Parks.  It gives campground, gear and family camping recommendations.  Theres a good piece on http://www.ndparks.com/hiking/choosehikingshoesmen.php choosing choosing hiking shoes for men that I recommend.
