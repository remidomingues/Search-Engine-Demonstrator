20070808 11:14:03 nbsp UC Davis is often cited as being a research campus.  Does this mean something in particular within the UC system (fund allocation), or is it a general description? Users/JabberWokky
  20070808 11:44:40 nbsp Funds, focus.  Users/EdWins
   20070808 11:48:20 nbsp Yes, but is it defined?  In otherwords, is it a general we fund research, or is it a UC System funding rule that $x million shall be allocated to research campuses under line n of the annual budget.  I.e., is it an official title that conveys money and requires paperwork to be filled out, or is it just a general, nonspecific term that can be used by any campus that does any research? (Hum.  According to my observation, the sky is blue and all the leaves are green.  This is now a research campus!) Users/JabberWokky
   20070808 11:51:26 nbsp (I just dubbed my home a research campus.  Woo!  Does UC Davis have any more claim than I?) Users/JabberWokky

    As far as I know, the state of California has designated (I believe, through the state legislature) all of the University of Californias (UCs) as researchoriented schools; they have PhD programs and research is an important (perhaps the most important) consideration in judging faculty for tenure, promotion, etc.  And yes, funding.  This contrasts with the California State Universities (CSUs), which have teaching as their primary mandate.  With one or two exceptions, they do not have PhD programs (although there are Masters programs), and although faculty are still judged by their research, less weight is (supposed to be) placed on it.  CSU faculty are supposed to be judged by their teaching first, and they teach more classes than faculty in the UCs.  And yes, less funding for research, as compared to UCs.  To complete the 3rd tier of Californias threetier system, there are the community colleges, with little or no emphasis on research.  These are the professors with the highest teaching loads.

      Are you referring to the wiki:wikipedia:California Master Plan for Higher Education?   Users/BrentLaabs
       Yes, thats it  thanks.  Sorry, I was too lazy to look it up.  :)  Users/CovertProfessor

20070809 11:06:03 nbsp Bingo.  Thats what I was looking for.  Thanks to all who dropped the right terms and links.  I figured it meant something specific (rather than just descriptive) since it is touted in various press releases.  Hurm... now, where to place this on the wiki (as relates specifically to research campus status, as the tier system is already documented)...
