Originally founded at UC Berkeley, CampusCred is a Groupon knockoff that caters to only those with a ucdavis.edu email addresses.  NonUCD staff Townies are out of luck.  Their focus is to introduce students to local businesses and eateries within their community.  For those not familiar with the Groupon business model, they basically sell coupons to local businesses at a discount of 50% or more.  For example, their first deal was a $20 credit for KetMoRee that you could buy for $10.  Each deal is available for a few days before being replaced with a new one.  Check the fine print section beneath each offer  there may be limitations.

CampusCred uses the tagline only for students by students! Although it is run and managed locally by Davis students (juniors Sherry Wang and Users/NSheel Nikhil Sheel are mentioned as local directors in an http://theaggie.org/article/2011/01/18/newcompanyplanstohelpstudentssave Aggie article), it is owned by nonstudents.

CampusCred has nothing to do with ASUCD aside from paying for the right to use their logo.  For a while the logo was displayed prominently on the webpage, as though the site were run by ASUCD.  At best it was confusing; and it was probably deliberately shadiness factor deceptive.  The process by which they first got permission to use the logo led them down a bumpy road, as well.  They originally signed an agreement with Mark Champagne who was unaware he had had no authority to license the logo. When it was pointed out that Mark lacked the proper authority to license the logo, they received the proper license from the senate (see File(sr07.w11.pdf)).  Meanwhile, Occupy Davis is protesting corporate money in politics.  Hmmm...

When they first started up, they also sent out an unsolicited spam email to many ucdavis.edu email addresses.  Presumably, they got the mailing list from ASUCD, which is pretty shady in itself.  The list seemed to only include undergrads, as some faculty, alumni, and graduate students have reported not getting the email.  They also distributed fliers in many classrooms when they were first getting started.

Those associated with the organization constantly try to whitewash this page as well.

20110129 15:31:42 nbsp As I posted on LeoThoms page, neither Jack, nor Joey signed an agreement, plus the Senate has to approve one anyways. Users/EliYani
  Hey Eli! Thanks for your comment. I apologize if I was not clear in our communications. CampusCred and ASUCD, more specifically, Mr. Mark Champagne, have a signed working agreement allowing CampusCred to use ASUCDs logo. Again, if you would like to view the plain English contact, please send me your availability and I would be more than happy to accommodate your schedule for a facetoface meeting. Thank you.

 I still think without formal Senate approval, you cant use the logo, even if Mark signed the contract.  Im not even sure if ASUCD as a notforprofit can endorse a forprofit business.

 Regardless, even if you think it, there is an agreement signed and if any further questions can be answered by the written agreement signed by CampusCred and Mr. Mark Champagne representing ASUCD.

20110129 19:39:37 nbsp So its like Groupon but for colleges? Sounds like a good idea. I wish this had been around when I was attending.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20110131 19:04:35 nbsp Was not a fan when UCD made a deal with US Bank and I tend to avoid most businesses that try to get through to students using some weird contracts with the school (Sodexo), so a business that gets started in Davis with a potential scandal with one of my favorite groups on campus (ASUCD)? Sounds awesome (yes sarcasm).  Users/hankim

20110201 19:51:26 nbsp Some feedback on the CampusCred website: the placement of UC Davis and the ASUCD logo up in the header, without any explanation or anything, makes it look as though its a program run by the ASUCD.  If its unintentional, its simply a matter of confusion.  If its intentional, its disingenuous.  I know a couple of people have voiced this concern here on the Wiki, and it came up with another person in an offwiki conversation recently.  To the several representatives whove contributed to this page: itd be great if you could take a closer look at the logos and figure out a way to use them that doesnt give readers a false impression. Users/TomGarberson

20110221 21:46:28 nbsp We have removed the ASUCD logo pending the passing of the bill despite our 90day grace period. We are not trying to misrepresent anything and all the confusion will be settled until it is passed. Thanks. Users/Nsheel
 Now are you going to explain your attempt to spam the student body?  Users/WilliamLewis

20110425 23:10:12 nbsp I remember walking into one of my classes in Olson Hall last quarter and seeing fliers for this taped to the back of every other chair. Although theyre not the only group spamming stuff on campus, I find it curiously shady. Kind of like those students who show up on the first day of classes and make a short presentation about that textbook website...  Users/CecilioPadilla
  I hate those people so much. I want to go around erasing every chalkboard just to spite those asshats. Users/hankim

20110429 14:09:11 nbsp They seem to get butthurt easily over negative comments about them. Users/hankim
