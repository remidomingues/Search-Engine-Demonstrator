Welcome to the wiki, and thanks for updating the Rotaract page. Im actually really interested in what your club is doing  could you add a section about projects youve done in the past or are planning on doing this year? For instance, which local groups have you worked with? Thanks for considering,  Users/JoRo

Would you mind editing under your own name?  Theres no problem at all with noting your affiliation with the group on an account using your name! Users/TomGarberson
