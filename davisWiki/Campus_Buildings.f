Although the most common image summoned when you envision the UC Davis campus is often a tree lined green expanse, most of the actual business occurs in the various campus buildings.  There are usually a few being University Construction built or renovated at any one time.  You can also rate and read about the Cleanest Bathrooms on Campus.  Campus Buildings also have Expired Campus Elevator Permits Elevators. Some are connected via Tunnels On Campus tunnels.
