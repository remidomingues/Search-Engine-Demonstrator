Campus Cellular is not a microbiology lab... the cellular refers to mobile phones.  In this case, Sprint telephones phones.   Although they are small, the guy who works here is super nice and knowledgeable.

If they are open, of course... as they may not be open... anybody wanna check?


They were formerly Fix for Less.
