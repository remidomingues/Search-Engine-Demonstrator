Campus Cinema, once its own ASUCD unit, is now part of the ASUCD Entertainment Council Entertainment Council at UC Davis.  Often the Movies movies that are shown are free sneak previews, either a few days before release, or screening tests several months in advance.  Campus Cinema presents its movies in full 35mm film, and digital sound at 194 Chemistry.

Campus Cinema also shows a wide variety of movies  blockbusters no longer in theaters but not yet on DVD, documentaries, and some obscure art house films and cult classics such as Further Indignities The Rocky Horror Picture Show and film festivals.

Campus Cinema started life as part of the Memorial Union regular activities showing 16mm films. Later, with the founding of ASUCD it became Entertainment Board Films. Finally in the 80s it became so large as to branch off on its own as ASUCD Campus Cinema with a new facility in Chem 194 with twin 35mm projectors donated by Dolby. Previous Directors were Users/SarahHillard Sarah Hillard (20032005), Aaron Brown (20022003), Users/JamesHirsh James Hirsh (20012002), Christie Koehler (19992001)...

In 2003 the UC Davis administration renovated Chem 194, unfortunately without regard for its purpose as a moviehouse, removing the sliding periodic table replacing it with solid panels on the walls (which destroy the acoustics of the room), as well as removing the black perforated mask curtain and replacing it with a solid burgandy drape serving no purpose but to muffle the speakers at the front of the room. Coupled with the proliferation of DVD in dorm rooms ending attendance, the decision was made to halt movies on campus and merge Campus Cinema with the entertaiment council in case free sneak previews were offered. Campus Cinema used watercooled reel switching projectors rather than the common platter technology. Campus Cinema showed Debbie Does Dallas in 1986.
