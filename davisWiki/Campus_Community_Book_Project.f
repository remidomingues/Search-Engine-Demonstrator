UC Davis established a Campus Community Book Project in 2002. Each year they select one book around which events, discussions and projects are focused for the campus community.

With the tiein to the variety of cultural celebrations held on campus every spring, the book project — which began as a means of promoting campus dialogue on diversity in the wake of the 9/11 Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — adds an exciting new dimension to the project in its 10th year.
