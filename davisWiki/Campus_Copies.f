Campus Copies is an ASUCD unit.  It is a combined unit with Classical Notes. This unit sells notes for classes; both archived (from last quarter) and current quarter, along with Readers turned in from professors.  They also provide a wide array of printing options for those needing to print from email, flashdrive, or from an original copy.


Campus Copies now offers COLOR copies (new 9/20/2011).

20090626 13:34:07 nbsp I really wanted to use this place to make my course reader  support students, direct revenue to the university, offer students convenience. I went by, though, during the posted business hours, and there was no one there. I sat and waited, hoping maybe they were on lunch but had left no note. No one showed up. I ended up at Navins.

   Hopefully, theyll read your tattletale Wiki entry and mend the error of their ways ;)  Users/BrianJKenyon

20090908 14:59:03 nbsp I wish I could say they got better! I decided to give them a second change and went back today to give them a Fall reader. I went to their new office location in Lower Freeborn: no one there. No sign or anything. And I know several people who were planning to finish their readers today. When I asked at the Information booth, I was told that Campus Copies tends to keep its own hours and doesnt answer its phone. I went elsewhere, as did a colleague who had the same problem today.
