Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion is a group that puts up /cause confusing mass posterings flyers around campus. They are more often than not /adj incomprehensible or confusing, which is really expected since they claim to /org promote confusion. The flyers are posted in unusual places, making them more noticeable. For example, they may post a flyer on Outdoor Adventures that says something like Nature is dangerous or something on a Recycling recycling can that says Recycling is bad for the environment. Their work is often seen as amusing but it can be unproductive, though they take great lengths to make sure they do not harm, damage or leave permanent marks upon the property. The greater meaning is yet to be determined, but we have it on good authority that wiki:WikiPedia:Mal2 Malaclypse the Younger would approve.

They occasionally come out of their secret hiding places, don masks and horns, and seek adventure.  They have an annual Halloween Caroling, singing the old favorites like We Three Ghosts.  Rumor has it that there are more flashy demonstrations in the works.  However, they are not involved at all in the Jack Abramoff scandal, and the group denies taking any contribution from his firm.

Some people think that their ranks come from members of the Students for an Orwellian Society, but in reality the Crusade was formed four years earlier than the Orwellian Society.  There may be some crossover between the membership, but their flyers and actions are not analogous.  The membership of the Orwellians is quite public, but the CCCC is a secret cabal of your friendly neighborhood wiki:WikiPedia:Discordian discordians.  There also may be a connection the English Country Dancers and the Internal Affairs Commission, but these are mostly just rumors.

 Their work 


   Frrrau Schnibbitt
   Pi Day
   Dihydrogen Monoxide Warning Signs
   Cactuar Sign

They are associated with the Stapler Liberation Front, as C4 donated the staplers so that the SLF could do its great deeds.

They are definitely not associated with the RandomQuote(Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion/Adj) RandomQuote(Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion/Org) RandomQuote(Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion/Cause).

 Suspected Members 
  Users/BrentLaabs  has an uncanny knowledge and infatuation with the activities of CCCC. Despite accusations of being a founding member, he in fact had not even begun living in Davis at the time the CCCC was founded.
   I am a humble researcher of the CCCC, not an active member.  I am interested in joining them, but I cannot prove who is a member.  I have heard of this Barnabas character, but have yet to make a confirmed sighting.  Im just aware of a lot of their lore because I am a discordian. Users/BrentLaabs
  Users/BarnabasTruman  member of the Ancient Order of Walkers; has been studying the activities of the CCCC for several years and may have infiltrated the group to some degree.
  Frrrau Schnibbitt Matt Godwin, deceased UC Davis Student, due to a CCCC flyer that quotes him
   If being deceased is due to being quoted by a CCCC flyer, may I never be quoted.  Users/MarieHuynh
  JoshuaNorton  According to information scavenged from all CCCC researchers, this seems to be a likely coconspirator in this crusade.
  users/MiranPark & Users/WilliamDavisJohnson both have left comments that they wish to join or not join, it is possible this is merely a diversionary tactic to keep their membership secret, or that they indeed are not members and simply wish to join or not, but in either case they are both suspect of membership or not membership.
  Users/MaxwellKappes  Has been asked about his involvement on more than one occasion and gets a kick out of pretending he has an affiliation to the freshman facebook group dedicated to the crusade.
   Kappes is probably a founding member; despite the fact he was only 8 years old at the time.  Little known fact: he was a child prodigy.
   Rumor has it that he has been known to contact THE founder, but the two of them have never been photographed in public together. Hmmmmm.

 Confnording message from those friendly with the organization 

There is no such thing as the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, otherwise known as C4 FNORD.  They do not put up random fliers FNORD and do no go around Hallowspleen caroling every year.

Rumors would have it that the leader of this nonexistent group is this guy:

His identity is uncertain, but it is suspected that he is a religious studies major involved in the leadership of Davis Campus Republicans.

This nonexistent group would, if it existed, which it doesnt, also be the sworn enemy of Students for an Orwellian Society.

Rumor also has it that Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion did not leave Christmas presents all over campus for unsuspecting students to find.

Baptist Blacktrick on Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion:
{{{It has been rumored that buried deep beneath the quad is a stadium with blood stained floors
where these two groups annually choose 1 member each to engage in a hand to hand battle to the
death. The winning group then claims possession of a sacred copy of the Principia Discordia
containing secret pages written in the blood of Malaclypse the Younger.

While both groups seem to be engaging in clandestine efforts to immanetize the eschaton,
it is likely that they are both utilizing novice apocalyptic techniques derived over 40 years ago.

How many popes ski down slopes
after smoking dope and preaching hope?
Could they recognize Eris within a quantum dot,
I certainly dont know and I certainly hope not}}}

Mysterious Message
Some time ago, a strange and mysterious message appeared on Davis Wiki, it is unclear if this is an action of the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, however it seems unlikely due to several factors, its purpose, meaning, and source remain mysterious.

Recent Activity
October Fifth, 2006
A group posted unconventional notices and posters warning pedestrians to avoid cracks while walking inside the library, in addition they may have also drawn misdirecting arrows on the traffic circle outside Chemistry 194, these events may or may not be related, and it may or may not be due to the actions of the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion.
October Eighteenth, 2006
Several fliers appeared around campus with seemingly pointless statements, ergo A dog, a plan, a canal, pagoda! or Madam, Im Steve, they contained the usual Campus Crusade iteration number (101 in this case) and this seems a legitimate action by the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion.
November Sixth, 2006
Messages appeared on the western side of Wellman Hall written in chalk, introduced as A secular message brought to you by the CCCC, and followed by either Have a Nice Day! or Smile!, it is unknown if this is the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, the same group responsible for the aforementioned chalking of October Fifth, 2006; or someone else entirely different. This message remained until late March 2007.
December Fifth, 2006
Fliers appeared around campus on standard white paper with somewhat L337 speak slogans written on them, however, these are assumed to be forgeries due to the lack of several key features, this may be an act of some confused members of the crusade, or someone else entirely different.
October Ninth and Tenth, 2007
Various fliers appeared around campus, most notably cactuar sign cactuar signs and dihydrogen monoxide warning signs.
March 18, 2008
Various flyers were found posted in and around Wellman and Kemper. Flyers included a membership application for C4, Dont panic, Work will set you free! From what?, and some nonsense about bilingual geese.

20061122 23:23:23 Image(leader.JPG, Unfortunately it is just as shadowy as the CCCC itself, right, thumbnail) nbsp  I interviewed a shadowy figure who was posting up some flyers recently, I took a photo of him. He stated that we should all be wary of Grues and to avoid the dark. Users/David Poole

20061122 19:40:06 nbsp Unfortunately my superiors have transferred me out of Davis, but I am still able to keep an eye on the CCCC to some degree. According to my research, iteration101 was indeed a legitimate, if somewhat unexpected, CCCC campaign, themed on palindromes and fake palindromes. Have a nice day! and Smile! are certainly in keeping with CCCCs past activities; presumably they are a reference to the infamous Smiley Campaign of 2001. Misdirecting traffic doesnt seem like their style, though; usually they refrain from doing anything that would genuinely cause trouble. And I dont think theyre responsible for October Fifthas far as I can tell (and I have done extensive research on this subject), October Fifth is a natural occurrence, following logically from October Fourth and eventually leading to October Sixth.

nbsp Need I remind you of what happened on Oct 5th, 1582 Barnabas.... it fully disproves your theory regarding the fifth of October. Furthermore upon smartalecness revisions have been made. ~Dave

 Let me start out by saying I am a fan of C4FNORD. However, they did the gravity posters wrong. It should read ... proportional to the product of the masses of the objects... or something like that. Or they could have just used acceleration. wl

20120231 03:14:41 nbsp I tried CCfCC, and while the service was good, about 4711 nanoseconds after I finished, I had terrible food poisoning which lasted for 17 months.  I was truly sick, I tell you.  Darn food poisoning!  I had to go on a pilgrimage to Plymouth RockFootnote(Honestly, where else are you going to travel to when you are on a pilgrimage?) and speak to the Great Oracle, who, when I beseeched hir how I could cure my horrible food poisoning, replied simply, To place a call, please deposit fifty cents.  Thus I was cured and have avoided CCfCC ever since.  Plus I hear they charge for water, which I heard from my neighbor (whom Ive chained in the basement) is illegal under federal and international watertax law.  Oh, and try the stuffed plums... they smuggle them in from free range plumistries, and are deliciousFootnote(They also pay their plumsmugglers a fair wage, although they donated 150% of their profits to the Scientologists and the SPCA, both Evil Cults.)!  I think I got bad service because of my raceFootnote(Foot), however the manager overcharged me by nine million dollars, which I later figured out was to cover any tips I might have written inFootnote(By the way, the above may be the only true Foot note on the wiki).  They no longer allow dogs over forty ounces, but the cookies in the office are awesomsauce!  In short, I highly recommend this horrible place and I wont return again and again.  Especially because they wouldnt accept my Peoples Republic of Davis national ID, and I was banned for 1,000 years.  Besides... they arent authenticFootnote(Im from The LA, so I know all about authentic, as The LA is an ancient land full of The traditions older than any other culture) and their hours are wrong. Somebody should fix that. Image(BoxersDrunk.jpg)  Visit my Facebook group to learn more, and dont edit this entry without asking me first.  AND WHOEVER THE HELL IS CENSORING MY REVIEWS NEEDS TO LEARN ABOUT THE FIRST AMEDNMENT!!!  Plus, you can get everything they have cheaper online.  More information to come tomorrow Users/JabberWokky

 Of course not. C4 doesnt exist and never has. Even if it did, thats too memeish and not confusing at all. If you saw some Discordian humor, perhaps youd be on to something.
