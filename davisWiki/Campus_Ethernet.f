How to Access Ethernet
You must have your computers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_address MAC address registered with UC Davis in order to use campus wired ethernet ports.  To do this, you must be a UCD student or somehow have a UCD login/password.  If you are going to live in the dorms, you can follow the instructions here http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/computers/computer_registration.asp. If you lived in the dorms, you likely did this.  If not, its painless  just go to http://computingaccounts.ucdavis.edu and click on Ethernet registration.
