The Campus Expansion Initiative was influential in pushing the Campus campus Move to D1 move to NCAA Division IAA athletics.  The initiative resulted in an increase in Undergraduate Student Fees student fees of $120 on average per quarter for Undergraduate Students undergraduate and $22 for Grad Students graduate students.  The majority of these fees are meant to pay for other Campus Buildings campus buildings (expansions?).  The student vote was purely advisory.


Although the bill was approved by 54% of the voting student body, some argue it is the worst idea ever, deeming it a http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/christmas_tree_bill.htm Christmas Tree Bill, and believe that the athletic expansion was worthless.

I hear the the advisory vote was actually illegal because they put it on the ballot right before the vote, thus not giving opposition any chance to mobolize.  Can any one confirm this? Users/josephaaronelijahstewart
  I can confirm that.  It was put on after the normal deadline for ASUCD Ballot Initiatives, and there is no ASUCD Senate Senate Bill authorizing the initiatives placement on the ballot.  However, it was not illegal, but it did violate ASUCDs Elections Code.  Users/RobRoy is looking into this. Users/BrentLaabs
   Someone already looked into this shortly after it happened. The Chief Justice of the ASUCD Court at the time declared the vote Null and Void because it was placed on the ballot in violation of the elections codes. I believe that justice was then removed from her position during a closed ASUCD Senate Senate session for a reason that I honestly cant remember. Hopefully Rob Roy can help refresh my memory through his own research. And yes, the Senate decided around that time that the ASUCD Court still did not have any power over elections.

The CEI continues to generate controversy.  SSFAAC has twice voted not to increase the fee in accordance with the CPI (inflation), in 2007 and 2009.
