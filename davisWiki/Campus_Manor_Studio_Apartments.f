20050612 14:07:59 nbsp Ive lived here for a year now and found the manager to be a very nice person. The main plusses are living alone and being right off campus. You really cant beat that combination in my book. NiareeHopelian

20060502 10:37:22 nbsp I also lived here a year without any problems.  The location is the best (plus covered parking, not often offered in this area.)  The manager lives on site, so is easy to get ahold ofvery good at responding to notes. EliSenior

20080503 20:49:55 nbsp Ive lived her for almost two years, and I think its a great place to live.  Quiet, you dont have to worry about buying furniture except for maybe a desk and chair, parking, coinop laundry, an apartment manager who actually enforces the rules and cares about making improvements to the complex  everything a studious student who likes her privacy wants. Users/Ruthann

20090117 21:02:16 nbsp Whats the square footage and lighting situation? Users/alyssap

20090426 15:22:45 nbsp Do the rooms have full kitchens? Users/BrianLi

20090426 15:31:55 nbsp (By which I mean, a stove top and an an oven) Users/BrianLi

20090513 14:59:18 nbsp Ive been living for two academic quarters in this apartment complex. Its been great so far. I can find no major cause for complaint.
On the manager:
Quite possibly, the best apartment manager one can encounter in ones life. Very prompt at fixing things, very responsive to notes you leave on his mailbox; in general, he is a very friendly and informative person. Users/EddieH

20090516 23:34:41 nbsp It sounds like a pretty sweet place  right next to campus and everything.
does it get lonely at all? if so how do you cope? :P just wondering!  Users/junniperlee

20090530 21:05:22 nbsp Does anyone have any photographs of the inside of these apartments? Users/nataliesadler

20091003 22:46:43 nbsp junniperlee: As a third year transfer moving into a studio, in a complex that already has a reputation for being quiet, Ive definitely had some lonely moments.  But I think its worth it, considering how uncertain it can be when it comes to finding good roommates.  The positives of living alone outweigh the negatives tenfold!

Also, if youre more of a board games and movie nights kind of person, as opposed to beer pong and crowds, Campus Manor is the perfect place for you :) Users/SJung

20091028 18:25:12 nbsp I thought Id put up a new comment. I moved in here in early August and I love it. It is nice and quiet. Only occasionally do I hear music or a television from a neighbor and thats easily drowned out with a fan. Another thing, too, the space is plentiful for one person! Its perfect. :)

And, I love the curtains, SJung! Im thinking of doing the same thing! Users/nataliesadler

20091102 15:56:10 nbsp hey  so this might be a dumb question but...do you HAVE to get the apartment furnished? Ive lived in greystone the last two years (this year will be the third) but now all my roomies are graduating and Im staying a fifth year so I wanna find some place thats simple for one person and close to campus. this sounds great but I already have couches and a bed and tables and stuff so does anyone know if I can get an empty apartment???

also, Ive been used to having my own washer and dryer in my apartment complex at greystone  how difficult, inconvenient, and/or expensive is it to do laundry there??? Users/brie311

20091203 05:28:38 nbsp To brie311: Hi there! To answer your questions on doing laundry, Ive been doing mine for a year now in the shared laundry room located on the ground floor. I have no major cause for complaint. The cost is $1 each time you operate the washer or dryer (must be paid in quarters since the machines use coin slots). The only drawback that I can think of is, you have to remove your laundry promptly once youre done. It is, after all, a shared facility and other tenants may be waiting to use the machines. It takes about an hour to do laundry for me: 15 minutes for washer and 45 minutes for dryer. Hope this information helps! Users/EddieH

20100122 15:05:40 nbsp Can anyone post more pictures? I want to see the other part of the studio. It seems so nice at the entrance :D Users/iciel

20100325 15:26:55 nbsp What is the average cost of utilities each month? I live in Florida, but will be moving to Davis for the Fall quarter and I am just trying to gain an understanding of how much it will cost to live there. Thanks. Users/bnolan1

20100325 15:35:19 nbsp What is the average cost of utilities each month? I live in Florida, but will be moving to Davis for the Fall quarter and I am just trying to gain an understanding of how much it will cost to live there. Thanks. Users/bnolan1

20100403 09:01:19 nbsp For me, its about $30/month for gas and electricity charges. The manager takes care of the rest (water, hot water, garbage removal). Users/EddieH

20100415 19:40:00 nbsp Can anyone tell me how long have you waited for before you get in? I filled out the form in March and havent hear any thing back yet...  Users/kay701112
  I havent lived there, so I cant comment on normal wait times, but for anything where youre applying to get in, its worth following up to express your continued interest.  Touch bases, let them know how interest you are, and itll be easy to find out what kind of wait youre looking at. Users/TomGarberson

20100418 10:24:03 nbsp Thanks! I did ask the manager one week after I applied. He told me I have a room. but from then on, I havet hear anything from him... Ill ask again anyways. Thank you! Users/kay701112

20110530 14:38:43 nbsp I have lived here for over a year and it has worked extremely well for me: it is SAFE, CLEAN, and across the street from school!!! The manager has always helped me with anything I needed  he shows up after one phone call or one note (that can be conveniently dropped into the mail slot on his door, here on site) and takes care of whatever needs to be done. In sum: EXCELLENT LOCATION and A GOOD MANAGER.  Users/Adri

20110606 16:52:06 nbsp Hello. Can anyone please tell me what the office hours are? Im not in Davis and need to contact the manager but havent been lucky. Is there any email adress for that purpose? Thanks Users/MagdalenaB

20110714 06:41:58 nbsp Is there an email address of the manager for contact? Users/YanruLu

20110928 15:59:47 nbsp @YanruLu:  Tim the manager doesnt have a cell phone, doesnt use the Internet (so no email address), and is out of his apartment for much of the day.  So the best way to contact him would be to leave him a voicemail through the 530number.  And because hes out a lot, there arent any office hoursId recommend calling ahead and scheduling something with him.

@Kay70112: Like TomGarberson said, if you filled out a form you should definitely follow up with a phone call and voicemail.

I honestly think its the best apartment complex in Davis, so keep calling, leaving voicemails, and trying!  Tim emphasizes that there be a studious atmosphere, he is quick to respond to requests, and is one of the best people Ive met in Davis.  If youre afraid of having to deal with shady apartment managers, leave that worry behind with Tim.  I sound like a walking ad but I really enjoyed my time at Campus Manor.  I just moved out after a twoyear stay and I miss living there so much.  Its right between campus and downtown, next door to at least six different food options, and a quiet place to have to yourself.i Users/SJung

20120109 22:30:09 nbsp Can anyone tell me about their experience getting a deposit back? I dont want to get stuck with a manager that unfairly takes your deposit,or a huge chunk of it.
Thanks. Users/maryh

20120222 18:45:18 nbsp Hello! Are there any studios left to lease starting in Fall 2012? Also wondering if there are any left for the summer, and if so, if its possible to begin renting in the summer and then stay in the same room for the Fall? Ive tried both the numbers provided on this page, but am still awaiting a response. Are there any other ways to contact Tim the manager? Besides the faxing option, I guess continuing to call and leave messages is best. It doesnt sound like Id be likely to find him if I tried to visit during the day. Id appreciate any suggestions. Thanks! :) Users/LookingForAStudio

20120224 17:25:45 nbsp @ LookingForAStudio: Im a current resident here and Im graduating/moving out after this quarter. I would love to find someone to take over starting Spring, but if youre interested in moving in during the summer thatd be great too! Shoot me an email at Mailto(aewu AT ucdavis DOT edu) and we can chat ) Btw, unless hes changed his policy, people who move in during summer get priority on rooms for fall. You may or may not end up in the same room.  Users/AngieWu

20121214 22:43:05 nbsp Im moving out in the next few days and my apartment will be available to lease for the winter quarter.  Not to sound like a broken record, but it really is a nice place to live. Quiet, extremely close to campus and downtown, and Tim (the landlord) is great.  Contact me at camoen@ucdavis.edu if youre interested. Users/CMoen

20130108 17:36:17 nbsp Im looking to rent a studio here starting from September 2013 to June 2014, if thats possible. What is the availability on the studios here? Users/YaoSaephan

20130604 16:36:17 nbsp Im looking to sublease my unit for July and August, price is negotiable and its possible to renew in September! just email me ahaberman@ucdavis.edu Users/Haberman

20140109 10:23:50 nbsp So, I have been living in these apartments for a full quarter now, and I understand that I had a quite rapid move in ( had issues with my previous roommate) but there are some things that I wish the manager had mentioned to me prior to move in.

No nails in walls (only tacks)
Cant let water go above switch if you are taking a bath
In order to get anything done by the manager he needs you to drop off a paper order (no email and can call but he rarely answers and has to get back to you)
The first couple months the manager checks on you pretty often which is kinda annoying.

Even through all of this I do like the place.  As long as you are good on your own this place is actually pretty nice, just gotta make sure you have friends.  If you have good ones who dont mind the slight shabbiness that this place has in spades then it is nice.  The location is beyond convenient, I love being able to go anywhere downtown or on campus in a matter of minutes. That being said I am gonna try to find an apartment that has W/D in room, just something that I find necessary enough to merit a move Users/PhilipDorin
