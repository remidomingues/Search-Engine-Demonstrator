Campus Munchies is like an online convenience store which delivers. They carry much more than munchies. Their aisles are: snacks, food, drinks, candy/gum, ice cream, drug store & supplies. A bit of everything. They do have refrigerated items such as milk and eggs, but do not have hot prepared items such as pizza. Prices seem to be slightly higher than places like Albertsons/Safeway. Their warehouse is in Davis and they deliver anywhere within city limits. Delivery is in about an hour and the minimum is $2.99. They were started by students.

20051207 23:38:39 nbsp I talked to the proprietor tonight, 12/7/05, he was cool. They are looking at expanding into booze. They seem to be based out of Olive Drive Market, (great place.) If you need chips and soda, Id give these guys a try. If they can manage to pull off the cigarette&booze delivery, they will be unstoppable.  Users/ChrisLambertus
