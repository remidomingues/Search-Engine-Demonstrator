The UC Davis campus has much of its own infastructure, including a phone system.

 About the System 
The UC Davis Campus has its own phone system which is probably some sort of wiki:WikiPedia:Private_branch_exchange PBX. Many UCD phone numbers have the format 752#### or 754####. For most phones on campus, you only need to dial the last five digits of the phone number to call another campus phone. An outside line can be reached by dialing 9 for local calls, and 5 for different area codes (this can only be done with an employee access code). Dialing 911 will connect you to Campus emergency dispatch rather than Davis dispatch. Freshmen have the option of getting a phone line in their room.
 Public Phones 
There are campus telephones which anyone is free to use. You cannot dial 9 to get an outside line, but any oncampus calls are free and people with access codes can dial 5 to get an outside line.
