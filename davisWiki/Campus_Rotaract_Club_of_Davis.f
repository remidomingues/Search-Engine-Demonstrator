About Rotaract
Sponsored by international service organization Rotary International, Rotaract is a service club for young men and women ages 1830.

Modeled after similar goals and standards to those of Rotary, Rotaract brings together college students and young business professionals for the purpose of humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting peace in the world. As one of the fastestgrowing Rotary programs, Rotaract on the international scale includes more than 8,000 Rotaract clubs in some 155 countries.

Each individual Rotaract club is sponsored by a local Rotary club, and are generally either university or communitybased. Each chapter has its own unique personality, sometimes with special emphases and focuses dependent upon the array of members and their particular interests. Like Rotary, Rotaract clubs meet on a regular basis, and are nonpolitical, nonreligious and open to anyone interested.

Rotaractors address many of global and local issues pertinent to todays society, developing projects that promote service, build friendship and provide a forum for cultural exchange.

The Campus Rotaract Club of Davis, also known as CRC Davis, is a SPAC registered group at the UC Davis University of CaliforniaDavis campus that is dedicated towards serving humanity.

CRC Davis meets every Tuesday night at 6:10 PM to 7 PM at Olsen 6 for the 2014 Spring Quarter. The location is also announced on the Facebook fan page, Twitter, and posted on crcdavis.org.
