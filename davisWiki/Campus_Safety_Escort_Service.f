A specialty program within the Aggie Hosts Cal Aggie Hosts , the Student Patrol/Escort Service is intended to promote campus safety at night.  Employees drive a white van marked with the UCDPD logo and “Cal Aggie Hosts... Student Patrol/Escort Service” on the sides.

Their primary mission is to escort individuals who feel unsafe between locations owned by the University.  This is a free service to anybody on the UC Davis main campus, including the Cuarto Residence Halls, Primate Center, and Research Park. If needed they can provide a walking escort to anyone that requires it.

Call 5307521727 and tell the dispatcher where you are and how many people need an escort.  When they come to pick you up, they will turn on their amber light bar (or amber bubble light if not in the usual van).  Get in the van, and they’ll take you where you’re going.

When  it is cold and wet, especially late fall quarter and most of winter quarter, they get pretty busy (even more so during passing time between classes), so you may be in for a bit of a wait.  Their operating hours are from 5:30 PM to 3:00 AM, excluding summer sessions and major holidays.

When they are not actively escorting people, they perform other tasks:
1.      Support any ongoing Aggie Host events
2.      Conduct area checks of the campus (such as dorm areas, parking lots, and the Quad)
3.      Any other task assigned by police dispatchers.

All employees of the escort service are fingerprinted and have been background checked.  Additionally, they complete the UC Davis safe driver training and submit to the DMV pull system, which informs the department if they have anything negative on their driving record.

Common misconceptions – there is more than one escort service van, the escort services is meant to transport large numbers of people (it’s only meant to transport 2 people at a time), and that it’s possible to transport bikes.
