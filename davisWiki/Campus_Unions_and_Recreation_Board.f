The Campus Unions and Recreation Board (CURB) is one of the campus Administrative Advisory Committees. It advises Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs on issues concerning the management, operation and capital improvements of all Campus Unions and Campus Recreation facilities, services, and programs. Much of the operating budget for CURB, comes form bookstore profits. However, it shares authority over the ARC with the Student Services and Fees Administrative Advisory Committee (SSFAAC), because one of their duties is to review the use of FACE Initiative funds.

The Board operates with four committees:
  UC Davis Bookstore Bookstore
  Programs and Facilities
  ARC
  Recreation
