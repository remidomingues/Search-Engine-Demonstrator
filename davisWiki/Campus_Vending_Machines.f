Many buildings on campus have vending machines.  These machines are owned and operated by Sodexho throughout campus.  The basement of Olson has what might be the only machine for test supplies

Vending machine types:
  Soda  Cocacola sodas. 20oz bottles are $1.25.
  Drinks  Noncarbonated drinks (Powerade, Juice, etc.)
  Snacks  Candy, chips, etc.
  Food  Bagels, yogurts, fruit, burritos, instant microwavable meals, etc.
  Frozen  Ice Cream These machines use awesome vacuum cleaner type hoses to retrieve your ice cream treat.
  Test Items   scantrons, blue books, index cards, calculators, etc.

Are there any 12oz soda machines around anymore?  20oz is way too much, and too pricey.
