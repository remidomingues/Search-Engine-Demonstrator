The Campus Violence Prevention Program, aka CVPP, provides support for victims of sexual assault, intimate partner violence and stalking. Confidential advocacy services are available to any UC Davis student, staff or faculty member regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, religion or (dis)ability. CVPP also provides educational programming and professional training on the topics of sexual violence, stalking and intimate partner violence.

Many years ago, CVPP had a staff member who taught RAD / selfdefense classes.  In 2012, that position was moved back to the Womens Resources and Research Center.  Late in 2012, the position was vacated; as of December 2013, the position has not been filled by the WRRC.
