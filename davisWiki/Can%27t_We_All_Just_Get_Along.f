  Please  DATE ALL REMARKS!  brIts tough on us newcomers to not know WHEN some thing was being discussed.  Its also very confusing to come in in the middle of a discussion.  Even on info pages, observations without dates (e.g., dead crows (which was in 2005)) can lead to confusion.  Thanks for all your work.  This Wiki is great. (201008) users/LoisRichter

As JW and many others have noted recently, a lot of the meta discussions over the last couple of months have been extremely heated.  Its bad enough that it sucks for the people directly involved, but unfortunately, its spilling over to affect others, including new editors who havent done anything more than inadvertently violate a disputed wiki norm.  Hell, norms not even really the right word, since many of the norms are under dispute.

If this trend continues, were going keep driving away wellmeaning editors.  Certainly new ones, and quite possibly old ones, too.  We need a collective wiki chill pill.  I feel that this is bad for the wiki.  Really bad. Users/TomGarberson

Pretty sure that this is all going to boil up again if we do not discuss all these things to death at some point. Possibly a bad time to do it since we are tabling and trying to be on our best behavior right now, but I think all the topics we get into heated debates over should be gone over before LocalWiki gets more publicized. Maybe we need to set up another forum for this? Users/hankim

I think talking in person is good.  Han, can you send me your email?  Im philipn@gmail.com. (for fundraising).  Users/PhilipNeustrom

I agree.  But things are so touchy that Im not even sure we can have this conversation without it devolving into accusations of whose fault it is.   Users/CovertProfessor

The thing that bothers me about it is that since I got active around here, Ive regularly told people that were a very friendly, helpful bunch of people.  Recently, thats begun to feel like a lie.  As a whole, were as likely to tell a new user to eff off (through reverts, angry criticisms of their user name, or whatever else) as we are to try to make them feel welcome.  At some point, we go from having a community that tries to get people involved to being a bunch of crotchety old farts who want the damn kids to get off our lawn.

I believe that every single frequent editor on here wants whats best for the wiki, but I think were losing sight, as a whole, of the fact that whats best for the wiki is far bigger than a few conventions and norms.  Thats not to say that conventions and norms should be thrown out the window.  My point is that the way weve been enforcing them, as a group, feels like it has done more harm than the conventions and norms themselves prevent.

I guess its kind of like the DLM magazine links: its not what were doing; its how were doing it. Users/TomGarberson
  To be fair, the user registration form does ask people to use a real name, and when someone just blatantly ignores a request of the community, I can understand not wanting to show them the same respect you would show to someone who does introduce themselves. Users/hankim
   What I am seeing is a lot broader than that.  Im seeing regular editors harboring anger and resentment for past actions, and letting those spill over into current actions, which is especially harmful when it involves new editors.  I include myself in this, but I see it in others as well. cp

I think that pretty much hits it on the head for me. People get really upset here because people dont use their real names. Well, its either a suggestion or a requirement. If its a suggestion, then people can ignore it. If its a rule, then they cannot. But if they choose to ignore a suggestion, then hounding them until they obey is a strange way to invite new editors. I think the ease with which people can be identified over the Internet makes people rightfully suspicious of using their real names in online discussions, or posting personal information about themselves. Those same people, however, may want to participate in a community such as this. I dont even know if its so much identity anymore than the fact a new editor had the audacity to edit an entry without first spending two hours creating a user page. Ive lived in Davis (and used the Wiki) for two years and Ive seen the vitriol just get more and more hot. Maybe its at times justified, like in the case of Users/CampusRec CampusRec. But I think its oftentimes not. I also think it feels awkward to a new editor when a long time one swoops in and {{{Law Students/Talk straightup reverts}}} their edits that werent really that serious and actually improved the pages readability. Sorry, CP, but thats the way I feel. If you want this site to be a cadre of computer programmers and locals who decide as a board of directors what is posted and what is not, then just keep up what seems to be the current policy. But if you want this to seriously be a community of editors with freedom to participate and have a 1:1 voice with everyone else, then I think the attitude must change. Users/BrianPakpour

Your wish came true, we are {{{Users/CampusRec/Talk all getting along}}} on something. Anyway, I feel that the whole new users thing has not been too much of a problem. I have been welcoming quite a few new users recently and I thought those welcomes were friendly. I can only recall about three that have had a rough start on the Wiki in the past few months. They just stand out more because reverts happen. Sure, it is unfortunate that some people get a rough start, but if you are going to be a Wiki gnome, you probably will be butting heads with other gnomes and arguments are going to break out, but that is normal in a community that is not a dictatorship. Users/hankim

I think talking in person is good.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
 Thats exactly what I was just thinking.  What would folks think of another wiki gathering?  Facetoface meeting is almost always a good thing, and beer and good company are one of the best chill pills out there. Users/TomGarberson

  Im trying to plan something to coincide with a fundraiser planning meeting so I can attend.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

    Maybe a tabling gathering? Users/hankim
     How about we go have sushi after the farmers market on Saturday? Users/NickSchmalenberger


I think that taking on a sour attitude is harmful.  Often more harmful than someone, say, not using their real name.  The goal is to encourage a healthy, friendly community.

As a regular wiki editor your perspective is very different from those who come on and, on a whim, decide to add something here.  We need to strive, always, to be welcoming, curious and polite (meaning: assume good intentions!) with new people (and everyone!).

Getting burnt out or frustrated happens, especially as a volunteer  its happened to me a bunch of times.  Its especially hard when you see the same mistakes over and over.  The key is to acknowledge that harboring resentment isnt helpful, and to step back and stop editing for a bit.

I also want to make a tangential point that theres a lot of seemingly social issues  like encouraging more identity, or changing the way comments work  that can be improved with more vibrant software.  So thats something were going to be working on real soon. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  What about those who we know instantly are here for their own wiki:danielledesma selfish reasons and Users/Xorg do not respond at all to any attempts at communication? Can we be sour to them? Users/hankim

  In the end, isnt it more a matter of treating others how we ourselves wish to be treated?  I know its an old cliche but they become cliche for a reason. Users/Wesone Wes
   Lol! Some people wish to be argued with way more than others. Users/NickSchmalenberger

Tom, I would be happy to discuss this topic with you or anyone else offWiki. redbarn@omsoft.com. Users/DonShor
Please look at the edit history of http://daviswiki.org/V.I.P._Studios_Photography to see an example of what I consider to be problem editing. Don
 It looks like it started out as a custom advert tag (as opposed to the Advert include), but ended up replacing the text of the page.  I agree that its a problem when it removes everything of value from a page.  It shouldve remained an advert tag.  BTW, I emailed last night, let me know if youd care to meet up for a cup of coffee... or happy hour, or whatever. tg
  I agree.  If an editor is faced with an overly advertisy page, the choices should be: 1) Fix, 2) Mark with an advert tag, or 3) Leave it alone.  Deleting everything and leaving a note like that comes across as hostile, even if that was not the intent.   Users/CovertProfessor

This seems like a fairly good place to discuss enumerating some standards for civil editing.  This stuff seems pretty selfexplanatory, but its become a problem lately.  Im going to start us off with just one.  Feel free to add your own thoughts and/or your own suggestions for standards.

 1. Do not revert an edit without leaving the user a courteous message explaining why.
  Despite how often the term is thrown around on here, vandalism is extremely rare on the wiki.  There are certainly cases of it (hi, CampusRec).  But the vast majority of the time, its just an editor who isnt familiar with wiki norms.  Id also suggest a corollary: 1a. If your message to the editor didnt work, assume that they didnt see it.  Because thats probably what happened.  Make a friendly, colorful note on the page in dispute telling them to check their user page.  Include a link.  Make it easy for them.  Dont resort to being rude or commentless reverts (which are rude) until youre actually certain that theyre ignoring outreach, and havent simply not discovered it.  Yes, its more of a hassle when gnoming.  But the recent tone has us headed in the direction of losing most of the participants who arent gnomes.  Thats no good. Users/TomGarberson

  I think this is an important and useful suggestion. I also like the idea of wiki norms being described somewhere.  Users/DonShor
   I like it if we add the clarification that it applies to all editors  new editors, longtime editors, anonymous editors, editors with names that are or sound real.  Even if its a name that bothers you in some way.  You dont really know who is behind the name, why theyve chosen the name that they have, or why theyve made the edit that they made.  We should assume good intentions and be polite.  Even if someone has behaved badly  when someone makes a personal insult or racist comment, or blatantly spams  it doesnt hurt to simply state that that sort of behavior isnt acceptable here, and perhaps even welcome them to contribute in a more positive way (this probably doesnt make sense for the spammers, but it might for the others).  cp
    For a list of examples see http://daviswiki.org/Welcome_to_the_Wiki?actioninfo&links1. Users/JasonAller
     Not everyone who was welcomed to the wiki welcomed politely. Or, sometimes it was assumed that a person was ignoring their welcome, when perhaps they simply werent seeing it. cp

   Tom, did you check out Wiki Ethics and some of the other pages where this has been discussed before? Users/JasonAller
    Nope, looks like a good read.  But honestly, thats part of the problem.  We have a lot of ideas all over the place, but even most frequent editors dont know where they are.  And any time an issue comes up, it goes back to no one owns it, there are no rules, only loose guidelines.  The Wiki Ethics page is good, and would be a good reference... if we actually used it.  And mostly for established editors.  Theres a lot to take in there, and throwing that, WttW, WttW/Business Owner, Identity, Importance of using your RealName, and so on, all into the mix?  Its entirely possible new users heads will start exploding.  pop ... and boy, thatll be messy.  Goofiness aside, I think having a simple list of just dont do this things would go a long way toward avoiding some of the problems weve had lately. tg
     I think that came across more negatively than I meant.  My point is that while weve got guidelines out there, they clearly havent been doing much to guide editors actions recently, and theyre widely scattered.  Whether we decide on new ones or just compile stuff into a single referenceone we actually useI think its worth making an effort to improve the tone and the interactions we have with users, old and new. Users/TomGarberson
     I tend to agree with this concept.  Users/WesP

For the record, I want to say that its all the argumentative bullshit and general aggressiveness of some editors that made me stop making any significant contributions to DavisiWiki and other Wikispot Wikis.  Its a shame, really.  I think theres a lot of potential for this type of media but somehow it seems to easily devolve into one of those crappy craigslist discussion boards.  Kind of like this page.  Ok, Ill go slog off into my internet cave of solitude now... Users/MaryLieth

   Can you think of some ways we could improve this?  Would having, say, an integrated way to vote on a given issue help (without having to take part in a longwinded discussion)?  We could bypass some of the issues with consensusbased decision making that way.  One of the major drawbacks of consensusbased decision making is that people often feel the most persistent folks win.  There are advantages and disadvantages.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

Anything further on this topic?
