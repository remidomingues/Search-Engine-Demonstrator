While named after our neighbors to the north, the Canada Goose is a variety of geese goose that spend quite a bit of their lives around the Davis area. There are a few places where these Birds and Bird Watching birds seem to have taken up year round residence.
  The California National Primate Research Center Primate Center front lawn had a flock at one point.
  Often there is a large flock between the Yolo County Airport and the Yolo Sportsmens Association.  One has to wonder what kind of a giant bird would want to live between an airport and a shooting range.
