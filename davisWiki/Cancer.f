 Avoiding cancer in Davis 
Many labs at UC Davis use carcinogenic chemicals or ionizing radiation.  Luckily the fine folk at Environmental Health and Safety actively monitor and manage all potentially dangerous chemicals.  If a building is shut down because of a chemical spill, they are the ones inside, cleaning up until it is safe.
