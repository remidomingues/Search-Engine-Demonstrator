Describe CandiceWang here.
Hello, I am a 21 yearold Students student at UC Davis.  I have lived in this town for over 9 years.  I love good, fresh food and people who arent afraid to speak their minds.  I love the Davis Food Coop, my family, running, music, fine arts, inspiration, twilight, warm beds, and bubble baths.  Um...

Ive been working at the 3rd & B Teen Center since October 2006 and am currently the Assistant Director.  Go teens!

I have followed many different dietary lifestyles and believe veganism to be the simplest, most delicious, nutritious, and compassionate one.  Since we live in a community where our livelihoods are not dependent on meat, then why eat it?
