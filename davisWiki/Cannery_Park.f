The proposed http://TheCanneryDavis.com/ Cannery Park development is a planned mixeduse development that would occupy the former Hunt Wesson Plant cannery facilities site.

Originally, developer http://www.lewisop.com/PlannedCommunities/plannedcommunitiesoverview.html Lewis Planned Communities, who purchased the land in 2004, presented the project at two public meetings on June 29, 2006 and July 19, 2006 before formally submitting the proposal to the city on 20071220. In March 2009, Lewis unexpectedly withdrew their proposal calling the project economically unfeasible.  Members of the City Council discussed the reason for the withdrawal at their 20090317 meeting.

On October 25, 2010, the Davis City Council directed staff  to proceed with processing of the Cannery application with additional direction that the business park be approximately 20 acres.

On February 28, 2011 the City of Davis and ConAgra Foods hosted a land use planning update meeting with the community gathered to listen and respond. Since then the project has been http://thecannerydavis.com/cityofdavisreviewstatus/#top reviewed by 10 city commissions to provide feedback to the development team and make formal recommendations to the city’s planning commission and city council.

The 2006 plans for the project included 100 acres, approximately 600 homes, 11 acres of office, a retail center, parks, open space, as well as semipublic land for churches, nursing homes, community centers, etc.

Information from the developer’s website (http://TheCanneryDavis.com/) shows they envision the reuse of its 100acre canning site as an An innovative, mixeduse, multigenerational neighborhood which will bring homes, businesses, and parks together in a sustainable manner.

The plan now includes approximately:
  547 homes,
  a 7.4acre working urban farm,
  nearly 30 acres of parks and open space,
  a Market Hall anchoring up to 172,000 square feet of commercial space.

Construction of the selfstated lowimpact, lowemission neighborhood would take approximately 3 years, with a variety of new home choices in each phase.  However, given that many homes will be located towards the north end of the property, with no way to exit but the south end, this is hardly a neighborhood from which the rest of Davis could be easily accessed (and its not particularly close to anything).  Most residents would probably drive, thus calling into question how lowimpact, lowemission the neighborhood would be.

On 20060630, The Davis Enterprise reported that most homes for the previous project would be priced from $350,000 to $450,000.  There is no pricing information available for the current version of this project.

The redevelopment of the former industrial site is inside the city limits and is not subject to Measure J/June 2010 Election/Measure R Measure R, meaning it could be approved by the City Council without a binding vote by the public. Public hearings for certification of the completed Environmental Impact Review and entitlement approvals by the Davis City Council are anticipated to take place in late summer/early fall 2013.  If the Council approves it, the zoning will need to be changed; it is currently zoned for light industrial.  Former Councilmember Sue Greenwald argued that the loss of an opportunity to build an industrial park in this location would put greater pressure to build one outside of Daviss current borders, creating sprawl.
