Capital Ski & Sports Club (CSSC) is a dynamic group of adults (18 to 70+) with a zest for life and a passion for winter and summer activities. Winter activities are focused around Snow Sports alpine recreational skiing and fun races for all levels. We also have race clinics to improve recreational skiing techniques as well as running gates. Holiday parties and potlucks provide other ways to meet new people with common interests.
