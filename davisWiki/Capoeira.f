Capoeira is a form of Self Defense that was developed by African slaves in northwestern Brazil. Capoeira was illegal in Brazil until about 1940, but is now recognized and valued as a uniquely Brazilian artform. Over the past thirtyforty years, the art of capoeira has been brought all over the world, and there are longstanding groups in many countries. Capoeira combines elements of fighting, dance, music, acrobatics and play, into an exciting dancelike fight.

Over the years, various capoeira teachers have offered classes in Davis. Since 2006 Sacramentobased Capoeira Agua de Beber has had a Davis branch. Classes are taught by Susan Pike a.k.a. Instructora Burbulias, a student of Contra Mestre Galego. Burbulias has been training capoeira since 2001, and teaching capoeira in Davis since 2006.
