Captain Tuttle is no longer with us : May 12, 2006
 We can all be comforted by the thought that hes not really gone, theres a little Tuttle left in all of us, in fact you might say that all of us together made up Tuttle.  Our grief will pass, its already hard to remember how Johnny talked, how he looked. His little laugh. Thankfully hes left behind a memorial. We salute you Captain Tuttle. Humanitarian and healer. Good luck doctor in that great big waiting room in the sky.


Personnel File

Captain Tuttle is named after a fictional character from an wiki:WikiPedia:Tuttle_(MASH_episode) episode of wiki:WikiPedia:M%2AA%2AS%2AH_%28TV_series%29 MASH (his owners  favorite show).  He was rescued by Users/AllisonEriksen at the Lyons cat colony in August 2005, missing most of his tail and obviously quite frightened and tired, judging from the ease of catching him.  Since being rescued from the cats, Tuttle has been living the good life.  He eats crickets from Pet Cetera and gets to go Central California home with his owner during holidays.  He once also got to attend a Monday Night Rehearsal rehearsal of the California Aggie Marching Banduh, a privilege bestowed on a select few Town Wildlife reptiles.  He cant wait until summer when his house can go Parkside Apartments outside instead of sitting under a big lamp all day.

Users/AynReyes is convinced that Tuttle carries Salmonella, but he claims innocence in the matter.  Especially since she does not intend to eat him, its ok.

This is a Photoshop representation of what Tuttle could look like:


But he doesnt look like this, so dont get too excited.  Damn that would be awesome though...


20060105 05:27:50 nbsp Damn cool... when I saw the page title I instantly thought of MASH, but figured it couldnt be a reference.  So, what are you going to do with his backpay?  ;) Users/JabberWokky

Captain Tuttle was found dead in his tank this morning.  He had acted a little bit sick earlier this afternoon, and I thought it had something to do with the heat.  I sprayed him with his squirt bottle and gave him a dish of fresh water (with a rock in the dish to keep it shallow).  A few hours later, I returned to find him upsidedown in the dish.  He will be dearly missed.  Users/AllisonEriksen
