 Key steps to being Carfree in Davis 

Accept and embrace your carfree existence
Carfree is an attitude as much as it is a mode of transportation. There are some serious #pros perks. There are also some significant #cons drawbacks. Better get used to them now â€“ your carfree life will be nothing like your carbound life.

Choosing your modes of travel
Giving up your car opens up lots of options. You may already know them from your days as a #definitions dabbler. Now its time to look at alternative modes of transportation with fresh, new eyes. These are no longer #definitions alternative: they are YOUR modes of transport.
  Walking
  Biking
  Amtrak Trains
  Bus Buses
  RoboChair for the more robotically inclined
Use the Transit Destinations guide to find the best way to get to destinations outside of Davis on public transit.

Not carfree, but occasionally needed:
  Carpool Carpooling
  #profits Friends with Cars
  Car Rental Car rental

Live close to the things you care most about
 Make a list of the top 10 places you go, organized by Navigating Davis neighborhood.
 Live in a neighborhood that allows you to travel easily to your mostfrequented destinations.
 Add your #credit carfree credit to the cost of your rent or house payment. This will help you justify the higher rents of living in the Central Davis Central areas of Davis, for instance.

Getting to work
 Pick a Employment job thats close by. Applying your #credit carfree credit will help you justify taking a local job over a higherpaying outoftown job.
 Pick your #how main mode of Commuter transportation
 Pick your #errands alternative mode for the days when your main mode just wont work.

Shopping and errands

Note some businesses and other venues may not let you bring your backpack in. See No Backpack Policy.
Grocery Shopping
Do you love to impulsively load up on stuff when you spot a big sale? Well, cut it out. Whether your favorite liter of soda goes on sale at Safeway, or you come across a mad summer sidewalk sale, your Buy Now button is gonna have to stop working. See the #definitions Lug It Rule.

You can still get what you need  you just have to plan a bit. Make multiple trips during the sale. See #emergency Emergency Measures. If your Buy Now button is a precious part of you that youd like to keep, buy a #resources bike trailer.

Furniture
Two words: delivery service. How else are you gonna get that futon home?
Buying furniture is seriously difficult without a car. But its one of the few things that is.
You have a couple of options in this task:
  1. Convince your friend with a truck that their old sofa is crappy and offer to go shopping with them. Find nothing at the store that suits their house, but happen to find something perfect for yourself.
  2. As stated above, pay for the delivery service offered by the furniture store.
  3. Realize that we cant buy from our great Davis Downtown local businesses all the time, and shop online.
  4. Taxi Services Taxi!

Electronics and delicate things
Um, you really shouldnt buy a TV and take it home on your bike rack. Ive tried this, and it turns out that its not a good idea.
Youre gonna wanna explore some of the above solutions (see furniture). Maybe if youre daring, plunk it in a #resources trailer.
Its also a good time to explore some of the more creative solutions to Carfreedom.
  1. For instance, shop at ACE Hardware Ace or another downtown downtown store, and borrow a shopping cart to bring home your goods.
  2. Buy a handtruck, wheelbarrow, or childs wagon to schlep home your electronics or delicate goods.
  3. Electronic stores will sometimes deliver for free if you buy over a certain dollar amount. Plan ahead and save up your purchases to buy all at once.

Coping with water
When living without a car, youll probably want to consider how you obtain your drinking water.  Some people drink municipal water from the Tap Water tap, hose, or drinking fountains. Others buy bulk filtered water from dispensers attached to the municipal supply. If you buy your water in refillable bottles, water is one of the things that you need to plan errand trips around. Consider yourself like many others of the world (16%, according to a wiki:WikiPedia:Water Supply WikiPedia article) that walk to their water source. Youll become aware of how heavy water is and how much work it is to carry enough to live on.
 If you arent getting your water from the tap you can:
   1. Lug it. Its a good workout to carry 24 gallons of water home once or twice a week.
   2. Bike it home. Those heavyduty metal bike baskets are great for heavy items.
   3. Plop it in a bike trailer. (Man, how I wish I had a bike trailer.)

     Or, heres a tip: Amtrak has an 11:30 PM bus departure from Sacramento to Davis. This is supposed to be a connecting bus from the arriving San Joaquin Valley train.

  More balanced perspective on Time.

Practical Considerations
Unique concerns, and making it all work

Choosing a primary mode of transportation
You have lots of carfree options, but since some of them take an initial investment or commitment to a monthly pass to make them affordable, youll want to choose at least one primary mode of transportation. Assuming that going to a job or to school is the most common reason that you leave the house, pick a primary mode that will best get you there.
Best way when you have a car usually means the quickest. Not so with a carfree life. Some days, getting to work without being wet is the best way. Other considerations are listed below.
http://www.google.com/transit Google Transit can help you plan your trip using public transportation.  Unfortunately, GT does not currently include Davis transit systems, but it does include Sacramento, so you can take Yolobus into Sac, then use GT to help plan your trip within Sac.



Daily errands around Davis
So now you can get to work or school everyday. But what about your other daily needs? If you commute to work with Amtrak or Yolobus, you need to invest in secondary mode of transportation for getting around town. Here are some things to consider:

#shopping Lugging stuff:
  Bike OK for heavy things, bad for awkward things
  Walking Good for light to moderate weight (1015 lbs) or weirdly shaped items
  Unitrans OK for heavy things

Distance:
  Walking Distance Walking Good for short trips

Time of week:
  Unitrans Limited schedule on weekends

Time of day (nighttime /early morning):
  Public transit often does not extend into late night and early morning, depending on your route
  Walking may not be considered acceptable by some folks due to the (very small) possibility of being mugged or assaulted

Choosing an Emergency mode
Life is different every day. A car may make you ignore or forget this, but in your carfree world you will know this well. The weather changes; your muscles hurt; you need to be to work earlier or stay later than usual; you have to bring in a cake for someones birthday... any of these things may be a reason to use your secondary mode of transport. If you usually walk or bike, sometimes you may instead need to bus it.

But sometimes you cant even do that. See #shopping above for examples. Now its time to use your emergency, often carFULL, measures.
  Call a Taxi Services taxi
  Call a friend

Carfree Credit
Your carfree credit is all the money you would be spending to maintain and use a car for your transportation needs. This credit can be applied to your other living expenses  it is a credit that can offset the costs of taking a local job in Davis, renting an apartment in a central neighborhood, or purchasing from less competitivelypriced local stores.

How to Calculate
STEP 1
Tally up your current expenses. If youve never had a car, find a friend who drives about as far as you do for work/school/entertainment and pump them for the nitty gritty.

STEP 2
Insert numbers into the below sheet, and total them up.
  For instance, in the first example your car expenses total $5,660 per year, each year.
  In the second example, youd only pay $1,490 a year if you purchase a used car.
  The third column shows that youd save in gas by purchasing a Prius, but would still pay a ton.
  The 4th column is left blank so that you can enter in your own estimates, based on the car of your choice and how far youd need to drive in your work, family and/or school life.


STEP 3
Calculate the expenses of your new #how primary and secondary modes of transportation.
Example, a Townies nonstudent using Unitrans to commute to work and a bike for errands would cost you $677 in the first year, and $447 for each year after that.


#Carfree_calculator Top of Carfree Calculator

STEP 4
Subtract the expenses from #Step3 Step 3 from the Total in #Step2 Step 2. This gives you the basic CarFree Credit.
Example: Using Unitrans and a bike instead of a recent but not new car earns you a $4,983 CarFree Credit in the first year of your carfree life. Whoa!

How to Apply to your lifestyle choices
Some ideas to apply your credit to a useful purpose

  Considering moving apartments? Apply the CarFree Credit to your new rent  you may actually be saving money in the end.
  Bummed that your trips to Costco may take a hit during your carfree transition? Apply the Carfree credit and you may find that buying in smaller quantities from local stores will save you on your bills overall.
  Tempted to take an outoftown job? Add back in all those car expenses and see if will truly be worth it in car transportation costs.

Note: The CarFree credit must be applied to your overall monthly or annual expenses to be used for budgeting. However, the CarFree Credit is endlessly useful for psychological applications, such as rationalizing buying a small X, or feeling superior for making choice Y or Z.

 Special Considerations 

 Carfree with kids 

Note: California law requires all children under 18 wear an appropriate Bicycle Helmets helmet while riding on a bike, in an attached baby seat or bike trailer, or on another wheeled vehicle such as a scooter or skates.

 Children under a year 
This is the most difficult stage to be carfree with kids, as biking with an infant is controversial. http://www.helmets.org/little1s.htm Most experts do not recommend bike or trailer travel for infants, as they dont have the neck strength for upright sitting positions in a trailer or bike seat, and the vibrations could be dangerous for their brains. Furthermore, http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc21212.htm California helmet law states that all minor passengers on a bike or in a trailer pulled by a bike must wear a helmet, but helmets are not normally made for infants under a year old due to these safety concerns.

However, many parents rig a car seat into a trailer, stick to wellpaved roads and paths, and feel, probably quite reasonably, that the vibrations and other possible dangers are no worse than would be experienced in a car. http://www.chariotcarriers.com/ Chariot Carriers makes an infant sling attachment for their trailers, but recommend it for use in stroller mode only, though they cant really suggest otherwise for liability reasons and some websites suggest using it for biking.

A good baby carrier is essential. Get a carrier with a wide weight range that distributes the weight across both shoulders and can be used in a wide variety of positions, such as a http://www.meitaicarrier.com/ mei tai or http://www.ergobabycarrier.com/ Ergo carrier. The standard Baby Bjorn (and similar carriers, such as a Snugli), commonly causes back pain past about 15lbs (the Baby Bjorn Advanced is supposed to work better). Slings that go over one shoulder are excellent for small babies and short trips, but may cause shoulder pain with larger babies or for longer trips. Mother & Baby Source carries an assortment of baby carriers, and has samples on hand for you to try out.

A stroller is useful, too. Choose a good stroller  one that youll feel comfortable pushing for long distances over uneven surfaces, with adequate storage for baby paraphernalia, groceries, or other cargo. A jogging stroller may be a good choice, as the four wheel strollers can be difficult to manage with Daviss annoying disabilityinaccessible street corners. If you dont have interest in buying a separate stroller, most new bike trailers have attachments that convert them into strollers, and theyre surprisingly easy to use.

  Toddlers and Preschoolers 
Once the child is past a year, you can stick them in a bike trailer or baby seat without controversy. Most people consider bike trailers to be safer, easier to manage, and easier to weatherproof than the baby seats that attach directly to the front or back of the bike, plus they provide storage for whatever else youre bringing along.

If you dont already have a jogging stroller, you may want one at this stage, as your child outgrows the more babyoriented stroller or gets too heavy to carry long distances. People may look askance at you if you have an older toddler or preschooler in a stroller, but thats their problem  they wouldnt have an issue if you were taking the same child in a car, and sometimes it just isnt efficient or possible to make a child walk on their own when there are distance or time constraints.

That said, encourage your child to walk distances when feasible  if you start building up young, theyll be used to it when theyre older. They can start learning to ride a bike at this age, too.

 Older Children 
Children who are too big (or believe they are too big!) for a trailer but who cant easily ride independently can ride on a http://www.sheldonbrown.com/harris/adamstrailabike.html TrailABike  a kids halfbike that attaches to an adult bike. These attachments can be obtained at local Bike Shops bike shops. A traditional tandem bike can also be used for children who are large enough.

You can switch off, too. For longer trips where a child might get bored, tired, or want to sleep, they can ride in a trailer (provided theyre within the weight limits), and use a trailabike for shorter trips.

If your child is riding for transportation regularly, get them a good quality bike, not one of the cheap ones commonly marketed towards kids.

 More Than One Child 
Double bike trailers and strollers are obvious choices. One child can be carried in a baby carrier while the other rides in a stroller. A bike trailer can be connected to a trailabike connected to an adult bike, making a train that can handle multiple kids. Use a tandem bike, trailabike, and a double trailer and one adult could drive a bike train of four kids!

The nice folks down the street do exactly that, and its interesting to watch the procession go by  Users/StevenDaubert


 Public Transportation With Kids 
Yolobus is free for children under 5, reduced price for children 518. The Unitrans website does not specify a child discount. A $15 summer pass, valid on both Unitrans and Yolobus, is available for children under 18.

Amtrak is free for children under 2 (one child per adult ticket), and half off for children 215 (up to two children per adult fare).

20070128 16:57:34 nbsp While Amtrak is an expensive option, almost every bus system (except San Francisco) accepts Amtrak transfers for free to/from transporation (you can get two transfers every time you ride Amtrak).  In Sacramento, this is especially nice if you want to travel by light rail.  In the East Bay, I understand, there are some good options as well.  Unitrans also accepts Amtrak transfers, which may be useful for some situations. Users/JaimeRaba

20070402 14:44:20 nbsp no quite car free...but usually commute on Yolobus to Woodland.  and soon willl be commuting on bike (to the landfill).  Our family has one regular car and one GEM (oversize electric golf cart).  so, often we dont use the gas car for days and days. Users/RocksandDirt

20070814 19:30:04 nbsp If the automobile is king in the United States, in California, it is GOD! (unfortunately).

I just returned after nearly 12 years of living on the other side of the planet (Ankara, Turkey), and I can only say that the availability of convenient mass transit in the urban areas of California is absolutely pathetic compared even to developing countries.  True enough in Davis (in which I have lived and/or worked in the years 19781983, 19861993, 20012004, and since July 2007) one can certainly deal with intracity commerce and living on bicycle and foot alone, as long as one is a homeowner or a renter who doesnt change dwellings and who works for the university (living in the Davis bubble?).  But isnt that the rare individual?  For intercity travel, I have relatives in Galt and Rocklin, and it takes 40 min by car and on my schedule to get to either of those places, 23 hours trying to get there without a car and on some mass transit systems own particular schedule (often Sundays and holidays excepted).

I dont have a car as of this moment, but its not by choice after just getting back from 3 years abroad.  The feeling of powerlessness, while certainly not daily, and sometimes not even weekly, hits one square in the face when one is faced with a crisis of some kind.  Yes, the monthly payments, the insurance, the outrageousness of gasoline prices, the depreciation...I am sure it all adds up to eating $500800 a month of my income if I joined the auto club todaywith an environmentally conscious hybrid, of coursebut I sure do feel better when I dont have to spend an inordinate amount of time going from point A to point B.  And no, despite being free to get things done when someone else is doing the driving (train, bus, etc.) I dont catch up on Harry Potter or that mass spectrometry journal article I have been intending to read, unless I want motion sickness.

20080209 07:51:22 nbsp I guess you could say my husband and I are carlite  we use the car for errands such as grocery shopping, but he works close to home and I commute to work in Sacramento on Yolobus.  I think yolobus is great  but it depends on where you live whether it is convenient.  I moved to a house that was right on the bus line, and that makes all the difference.  I especially like the fact that as gas prices rise, it doesnt really impact us (except, of course, in higher grocery prices, etc.).  Being carlite is great  it saves money and the environment. Users/AcMach

20080812 13:01:03 nbsp Its very easy to be car free in  Davis.  I work in Sac and take teh Amtrak daily.  Bus would be a little cheaper but would take longer.  Committing to the commute and buying a monthly train pass saves a lot of $$$.  My pertrip cost is a little over $2 each way.  Plus, many large employers will reimburse some amount of the cost of commuting by train or bus to incentivize doing your part to reduce pollution.  With all of this, I pay about $1 each way to use Amtrak.  Biking to/from the train stations is simple & easy and although there are lots of bikes on the train, conductors are tolerant of bikes in excess of racks as long as they dont block the pathways.  Finally, the 8:02 morning train is often late but rarely more than 10 minutes.  The 9:17am train is opften a disaster but there is a 9:30am Amtrak bus that is quick & they accept train passes.  The return trip from Sac is always on time. Users/Dora5

   Car free is just means you dont have a car, or you have a car but you never use it (basically the same thing). You transport yourself via other means other than a car. This doesnt include anything past the first degree of separation. The general meaning is that by being car free, you are one less car on the road. Users/KellyM
