 Advice on Buying a New (to you) Car 

It is no secret that car dealerships employ a whole suite of tactics to soak you as much as possible.  Its psychological warfare and if youre not prepared, you are going to lose.  This, of course, is not unique to dealerships in Davis, but is common throughout the auto sales industry.  If you are considering buying a new car in the near future, read these tips and begin to prepare yourself.  And, of course, please add any advice that you have learned elsewhere.

Remember, that you can often get better deals on car loan rates at notforprofit Credit Unions as opposed to forprofit Banks. It might not seem much, but it could save you hundreds of dollars if you go with a credit union.

 Research 

  Know and be confident about the price of the car you want  use http://www.edmunds.com Edmunds, http://www.kbb.com KBB, http://www.nada.com NADA, etc.  Be aware that many of the salespersons rhetorical techniques are designed to break your confidence and to get you to accept the prices they suggest.
  Read http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/42962/article.html Confessions of a Car Salesman on Edmunds.com to get an idea of what youre up against.
  Go to many dealerships and __get quotes__.  Make the dealers bargain against one another.  They hate this, but it works.  This can also be a frustrating process for the buyer (theres only so many times you can here the words what will it take to get you to drive home in this car today before you snap), but its worth it.
     Dont do this. You have no power, dont even pretend like you do. Every single person in that dealership  from your salesman to the sales manager to the general manager to the lot guy  is there for one reason and one reason only: to separate you from your money. You think they havent been crossshopped before? Youre delusional if you think its going to get you a better deal. It isnt uncommon to be misled during these quotegetting sessions. Remember, youre one person who does this maybe once every five years. Theyre a crack team of pros who do this time and time again EVERY DAY. The way to get a good deal is this:
  Understand that California has some nice buyer rights, including a mandatory option to buy a http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d05/vc11713_21.htm two day cancellation period for used vehicles and a http://www.ag.ca.gov/consumers/general/lemon.php lemon law that protects you as a purchaser.

 Planning 

  Know what you want and decide if youre flexible (If they dont have metallic blue, will you take gray? If they dont have the 5speed, will you take a manumatic? etc).
  If youre buying new, find the invoice price, the factorytodealer rebates, dealer holdback, and financing incentives (if youre financing)
  Other sites go into greater detail, but the basic story of a good deal is this: For a new car, $500 back of invoice is an outstanding deal which you can usually pull without trouble unless the car is hard to come by or otherwise premium (good luck getting $500 back on a Mercedes CLK). On a used car, 20% back of the average of TMV and Blue Book is excellent for a nonpremium make of car (Toyota, Ford, Chevy, Isuzu, etc); as low as 15% back is acceptable for premium brands in exceptional condition (BMW, Volvo, MB, Lexus, Acura).

 The Haggle 
  Never rush to buy a car or get into a bid war.
  Get prepared for a long afternoon of negotiating. Start by asking for the moon, because theyll do the same of you.
  Once you have found the car you want, dont be afraid to walk away if they wont give you the price youre asking.  They will often crack as you are about to step out, or call you later in the week.
   This works! My mom got pissed and walked off when we were working on buying my car, some guy came running out after her car and stopped us, we ended up getting the car at a better price. Users/MichelleAccurso

 New Cars 
  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle did a lot of research on this a couple years ago and this is what she remembers:  December may be the best month to buy a car as people are too wrapped up in Christmas to think about car purchases and dealers are desperate to sell.  Early fall is also good, as dealers often want to clearance out current models before the next years models come in.  April is also a good month to buy, but she cant remember why.

 Used Cars 

  If youre buying used, take it for a test drive and dont fear the salesman. Most salesmen welcome the opportunity to get off the lot. This is not the time to fight. Let him go with you if he wants. But, do NOT forget to go again alone, and also to take it to your own shop to get it checked out (often a <$100 procedure that can save you thousands).

 Auctions 

  A different approach to buying used cars for cheap are repossessed car auctions. These are public auctions (there are private ones, too) where you can bid on bank repossessed cars, which are vehicles whose owners defaulted on their auto loan payments (therefore allowing the bank to repossess the car). They take place both offline at local lots and online (the most popular place to find repossessed cars for sale online would be ebay motors). Point is, repossessed cars are usually bought for a fraction of their price, sometimes even 70%80% less than their market price. There are, however a few things to remember before bidding on repossessed cars:
   Attend a few auctions in advance. Study the codes and regulations. See what dealers and more experienced attendants do.
   Always ask for a VIN (vehicle identification number) and check the cars vehicle history report. This will help you determine (to a point) the condition of the vehicle.
   Youll be provided with a day or two to check the cars condition in person. Do it. In fact, take a mechanic with you. (This point as well as the previous one are valid for buying any used car).
    Where can I find such a mythical place? Users/MasonMurray
     Car auctions are usually announced in various media like newspapers.  A news feed filtered for auctions would probably work.
