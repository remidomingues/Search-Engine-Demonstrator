Taking Amtrak or Yolobus might be cheaper, and better for the environment. Same with finding a carpool, perhaps using the Wiki Ride Board. But sometimes, the bus and train wont go where you want, and you cant find a carpool, or your carpool has no car. Then you could try paying one of the following car rental places to let you use one for a few days.

20100317 16:52:41 nbsp In case you dont know, you are required to have car insurance and its not included in the cost of the rental car.  Car insurance can double the cost of the rental, which I discovered by surprise.  However, you may be covered under some other policy; for example, certain credit cards come with free car insurance for rentals if you pay for the rental with one of them.  In fact I think this may be a standard feature for most credit cards.  I now have a credit card from BofA that I never use except for when I rent a car.    Users/EfremRensi

20120917 21:22:28 nbsp Rented a minivan from the Hanlees Toyota guys this past week  best experience! Yes, having your own insurance is a requirement, but they were very up front about this when I called, as well as the requirement for a credit card hold. The car was exactly what I expected. It felt new and wellmaintained  not grimy like so many rentals in Sacramento or from airports. The entire experience was hasslefree. For intown rentals Ill never do anything else. The price for a weekly rental was ~$300 less than anywhere else I could find.  Users/DanielBoxwell
