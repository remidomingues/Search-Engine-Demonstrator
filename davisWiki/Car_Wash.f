For people living in apartments or dorms who dont have access to cleaning equipment, or for people just too Procrastinating busy, there are several places in Davis to get your car washed.

For those of you who live in houses, I strongly encourage you to park your car on the lawn and wash it there. This prevents large amounts of soap (and other nasty chemicals) from ending up in Putah Creek. It also uses waste water to water your lawn, saving water, one of the most valuable resources. Dont worry, it wont hurt your lawn.

 Gas Stations 
Most gas stations will give you a discounted car wash if you purchase a certain amount of gas. In general, the cheapest option does not include drying.

 Free Car Washes 
Every so often youll see someone outside of Save Mart holding up a sign advertising a Free Carwash. This is usually a Fraternities frat or Student Organizations club trying to raise money though donations. I dont know if theyll wash your bike. The local Spiritual Organizations churches on Anderson have also had free car washes, only they will refuse donations. Apparently there are statewide contests to see which youth group can wash the most cars for free. In 2003, they competed for a trip to Mexicali. Their advertising practices, i.e., jailbait bouncing up and down in bikinis, is somewhat Shadiness factor shady.

Often during the Saturday Farmers Market Farmers Market, there will be similar free/askingfordonations car washes held by various high school groups in the parking lot at the corner of Russell and C St..  (Sometimes these charge a small fee, so check the signs).

Davisville Express Lube offers free car washes during the summer if you get your oil changed there.

There is a free, automated car wash in Fleet Services, but its only for university vehicles.
