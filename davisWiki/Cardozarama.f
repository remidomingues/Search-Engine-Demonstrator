Cardozorama (renamed Aokirama in 2011 in honor of the late Professor Keith Aoki) is the annual School of Law Talent Shows talent show.  It is held on two consecutive nights midweek at the Veterans Memorial Center theater.  The show consists of a 3L Movie written and performed by thirdyear students (with the participation of remarkably accommodating professors!) and a wide variety of performances from students and faculty alike.  The combination of great acts and a healthy (or unhealthy, as the case may be) supply of alcohol before the show and during the intermission ensures that the audience remains lively.  While most of the skits and gags performed by the MC between acts revolve around law school life, the performances themselves include music, dance, and standup comedy for wider appeal.

The event is named after Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.  No one knows why (OK, not really... someones sure to know). There is also a law school in New York City named after him.

Past Cardozoramas:

It was filled with bad jokes about the schools struggles with a low bar exam pass rate in 2008, a substantial drop in national rankings, and student frustrations with the Law Schools career center in a slow economy.
