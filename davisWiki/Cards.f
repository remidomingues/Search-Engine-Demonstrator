Cards are used for identification, payment, fun and collected.  There are a wide variety of cards in use throughout Davis.  Credit cards make payments (and often are debit cards for ATMs).  UCD students use their Reg Card for just about everything.  People looking to drive automobiles or motorcycles need to go to the DMV to get a license... in the form of a card.

Card games that use a traditional 52 card (plus jokers) deck or two include poker and fuck the dealer.  Add alcohol to the cards and you get a variety of drinking games like Kings cup or Drunk Driver.   More involved card games use special or collectible cards.  Often connected to the same circles as roleplaying games, popular ones include Magic the Gathering and Uno.  Again, if you mix alcohol into this in the way only college towns want to, you get games like Drunko.
