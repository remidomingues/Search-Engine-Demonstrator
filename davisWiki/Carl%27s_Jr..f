Davis local obligatory Carls Jr. also happens to be paired with a Green Burrito, which is common practice in California and Arizona. According to http://news.yahoo.com Yahoo News, system wide there are 1,017 Carls Jr. fast food restaurants, 223 of which are dualbranded with Green Burrito. One of the great things about combining Carls Jr. with a Green Burrito is the ability to put salsa in your burgers or on your fries. They offer a 10% Senior Citizens senior Discounts and Freebies discount.  You can get a Hamburgers burger there, among http://www.carlsjr.com/menu/ other things.

In early 2014 a South Davis location was opened, in the husk of the former Wendys, which includes the long desired drive thru that the East Davis location lacks.

At least one student in 2005 believed the Davis franchise managed to be sufficiently worse than other Carls Jr. franchises and should be avoided at all costs. Hes probably graduated by now. And it is possible the management of the Davis franchise has changed in the intervening neardecade.  If said student was a food science & technology major, its also possible he could be the manager of Carls Jr. now.

Outside of the Western U.S., Carls Jr. is named Hardees, and has the same menu and logo, although menu items go by different names (the six dollar burger is a thickburger).  Check out the distribution of the two using http://www.fastfoodmaps.com/static.html Fast Food Maps or look at the map below.




I havent been to the Carls Jr. in Davis, but I like their selection of carbsmart burgers.  SS


  Carbsmart is fatstupid.

20050506 20:22:36 nbsp Carls Jr. is known as Hardees on the East Coast. They sell the same things like the $6 Dollar Burger but breakfast menu items are heavy on biscuits rather than burritos.  Users/CandiceBrown

20050506 23:45:20 nbsp Why isnt there one Carls Jr. that can make DECENT fries!?!? Users/PatrickSing

20050613 20:33:00 nbsp Whats up with not having drivethru? Fast food NEEDS drivethru Users/AshleyOrsaba

20051112 00:33:03 nbsp This Carls Jr. takes the cake on cleaniless and food quality. The cooks, Maricela specifically, do a fantastic job of making picture perfect burgers. There used to be a drive through for bikes at one point in time, which was since removed. Reason is speculated to be an employee breaking the window and the repair guy never replacing it. This branch of Carls Jr. is the highest ranking in the district, as well as the only one without a drive through. Users/TarynHornen

20051208 18:00:55 nbsp The 6 dollar burgers are obscene.  Childhood obesity, and early onset diabetes are a consequence of unhealthy food.  You can say to each his own, but unfortunatey we as a society face the burden of cost when an epidemic of diabetes takes place and the healthcare system becomes strained.  I predict a classaction lawsuit against fast food companies just like the tobacco industry faced in our lifetime Users/DudeNude
     Not to start a flame war, but if youre a parent and you buy your kid a $6 burger, then its not Carls Jr.s fault that your kid is fat and has diabetes.  I dont know of many 9 yearolds who go to Carls Jr. and have $6 out of their pocket to pony up for a burger. Users/CaseyBarc

20051211 03:42:43 nbsp I highly recommend the chocolate shakes and burgers from Carls Jr. in the Silo, but the fries are seriously lacking. Users/ThomasFifield

20061008 01:12:41 nbsp I went to the Carls in the Silo ... the food was nasty. nough said. SS

20061214 05:09:09 nbsp I ordered a hamburger there today. I saw the person making the burger lick some extra dressing off her finger and continue to make the burger. I ate it anyway. Users/DanielWorthington

20070512 18:20:24 nbsp I am an avid health freak, however I have searched the menu and they do have some healthier options such as salads. However, use fat free salad dressing or it will defeat the purpose. The Charbroiled BBQ Chicken Sandwich is actually pretty good tasting and doesnt have too much fat. Users/Jedron
  Getting full fat dressing does not defeat the purpose of a salad. The nutrition information you see is for using the whole dressing packet, which is an obscene amount of dressing (if you use half that much dressing, which is still more than a side of dressing at plutos, your salad wll certainly have less fat than the burgers on the menu). Also salads have more micronutrients per calorie than the burgers, regardless of dressing contents. However, if i want a salad im not going to Carls jr. I usually get a famous star, without mayo or cheese and extra lettuce and tomato, if i end up going here. Note they do not inventory the vegetable toppings so they do not cost extra. edit: due to an employees abuse of the not charging for extra veggies policy (I assume they put a salad on their burger) they now charge 20 cents per extra topping. Users/MattHh

20070512 21:31:51 nbsp Im not sure what is more pathetic, that Carls Jr here quotes a review from the Torrance Daily Breeze or that the Torrance Daily Breeze reviewed Carls Jr. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 haha thats pretty funny. They must have run out of places to review :). Users/MattHh

20070515 14:24:42 nbsp the CJs on Covell is pretty good actually. I like how its paired with the Green Burrito menu, so you can have more choices. The one at the Silo is TRASH. not only is the menu lacking, everything is overpriced. Users/DonaldJaye

20070719 17:55:33 nbsp Best hamburger if it is the 6 dollar burger be honest very good i like the western bacon with extra crispy bacon Users/dickjones

20070804 03:36:42 nbsp Love the big burgers actually i think best around besides the squeeze inn in Sacramento that place rocks. Carls is a great place to get a good fast food burger my opinion Users/Brians

20071227 01:31:34 nbsp Yumyums!!! Users/thelonepiper555

20080115 05:38:16 nbsp The night crew at the Carls Jr in the Silo can be pretty shoddy

During one trip there, I received the wrong soda, took it back and got a new one

Then I got the wrong meal, which I also took back after opening the burger and seeing that it was not mine

As i took it back, another girl went up to ask about her food. As it turns out, I was given her order. As the server walks off to get my order, the girl opens her bag, takes out her burger, and stares at the open wrapper for 5 full seconds. Then she seemed to decide, fk it and just left.

i barely contained my laughter Users/fredchen

20080123 21:32:58 nbsp Does the Silos Carls Jr. accept coupons? Users/sfjhffihojh

 It is!

20080430 13:44:11 nbsp Whats up with the sign at the Silo that says: WARNING, this food causes cancer and birth defects. ?

Anyway, the people who have commented saying they like the carbsmart burgers or use the fatfree dressing are idiots. People who fool themselves into believing these things make fastfood healthy deserve to be fat. Please, rid the world of your stupidity by gorging yourself on food and getting all the healthrelated problems that come with diabetes. Users/Loccster

20090504 16:37:42 nbsp I love the burgers at Carls Jr, theyre so yummy. Users/thtly

20090504 20:26:10 nbsp The bourbon burger is gross, the bbq sauce makes it way too sweet. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  I agree. I tried it with a buy1get1free coupon, and it was all I could do to finish even one. I would have given the other one away, but I didnt know anyone that I disliked enough. Users/JoePomidor

20090505 09:45:10 nbsp The one on East Covell Boulevard is only good for one thing, and that is a place for students from Holmes Junior High School to hang out when they ditch class.  I heard they used to chase students out a few years back (makes me feel old thinking back like this).  But I figure theyd rather the business.   Users/MasonMurray

20090505 09:48:10 nbsp every time I eat fast food, I regret it shortly after. Users/RealComputers

20100123 17:16:53 nbsp The Carls Jr in the silo has some of the best shakes! Users/elliotgoethe

20100712 14:38:56 nbsp I have visited Carls Jr. multiple times over the last few years and the staff have always been clean, efficient, and considerate.  Food does seem to take longer than at other fast food restaurants.  No worker has ever had difficulty understanding my order, nor have I had difficulty understanding them (and I can only speak English). Users/MattCundy

20100712 15:26:40 nbsp I live close to Carls Jr and bike here regularly. I have always had good experiences with the staff, I especially like the teriyaki burger and breakfast burger. The avocado burger is also very good. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100713 01:36:20 nbsp I love the Carls Jr in North Davis. Boy do I love this place. What is it? Its just a good value for the burger, so damn tasty, attribution to the charbroiled goodness. The bike ride there is worth it, and definitely helps tone down the feeling of guilt when I engorge myself into one of their delicious Big Hamburgers, or sometimes I really like to reward myself after a week of monotonous lectures with a Teriyaki burger. Have your crisscut fries, because today, today resources are no object!

tl;dr I love this place. Users/davidennis

20100713 15:17:18 nbsp I consider it the best of the national chain hamburger joints in Davis. Users/JimStewart

20110430 18:16:42 nbsp Im very impressed by the six dollar burgers and the skinon fries. We just dont have good fast food burger places like that in Denmark (only McD and Burger King, and you have to go to a Cafe for a decent burger, hence the expression only buy burgers where you can also buy a beer with it). Unfortunately, Ive usually been at Carls jr at campus, where every other burger is cold. Does the north Davis place have that problem too? Users/MichaelNielsen

20120111 22:43:04 nbsp As of January 2012, it seems like the Silo Carls Jr. will open at 10AM and no longer be serving breakfast. Farewell, hash brown nuggets! I hardly knew thee. Users/AbbYu

20121028 15:18:02 nbsp when did the east davis one open? Users/davisrox
Days ago, Hella days...
  Been there since I was a kid so at least early 90s Daubert
   Been there since I was a kid too, so Id push that back to early 80s. Users/jefftolentino
     I hear the 80s, 80s is on the table, do I hear 70s? 70s folks, can anybody recall the 70s?  80s going once...
      I say 70s.  My son considered getting a job there while in high school and he graduated in 1980. That would narrow it to between 76 and early 80.

20140209 22:06:22 nbsp Service is fast, obviously, but the sad thing is no drive thru :( The milkshakes are made with real ice cream and are delicious. The spicy chicken sandwich is a bargain. Users/YoungResident
