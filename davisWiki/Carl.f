Relegating this whole topic to pages meant to help wiki editors work out edits would simply be burying what pxl is trying to write.

Unlike Wikipedia, Davis Wiki doesnt require pages to adhere to a neutral point of view. Pages dont have to be completely impartial. You, of course, are free to add your own take on the matter directly to the article, just as pxl has done.

On a final note, opinions dont have to be relegated to the comment ghetto. A some of us older editors, in fact, dont like that the comment macro has drifted off userpages. On userpages, the comment macro facilitates easy communication. On other pages, it discourages people from improving the page.

20100301 16:29:28 nbsp Hey, Carl!  The wiki is by the community and about the community... controversy and a diversity of opinions is part of the context of every subject.  Unless youre saying that theres no controversy and no real passion about Coops in Davis, that passion and controversy really should be in there.  Davis Wiki is not like Wikipedia; it does not aim to be an encyclopedia (and does not have the persnickety rules that mandate a neutral point of view and no ability for witnesses or those involved to speak on their behalf).  It is a work by the community about itself, and as a result, there are plenty of controversies and opinions that fit into entries all around the wiki.  Be active!  Add your voice to entries!  You are a human being whose passions and feelings  barring personal attacks  should and can be heard!  Just give the same elbow room for other peoples voices and there is plenty of room for everybody to add to the community perspective on the wiki.  Be brave and speak out!
