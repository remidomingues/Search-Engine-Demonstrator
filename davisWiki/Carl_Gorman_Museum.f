The C.N. Gorman Museum is committed to the creative expressions of Native American artists, and artists of diverse cultures and histories.   Changing exhibits feature contemporary artwork in a wide range of media, reflecting the canon in which Indigenous artists are working today.  Founded in 1973 by the Department of Native American Studies, the museum is named in honor of retired faculty member, Carl Nelson Gorman, Navajo artist, WWII codetalker, cultural historian, and advocate for Native peoples.
