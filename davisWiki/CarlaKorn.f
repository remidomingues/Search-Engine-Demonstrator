20060805 12:04 I can see where you might want to provide some balance to the Dowling Properties page, particularly since the only heading there reads more like a complaint. It is difficult for someone who is affliated with a business to read quite public complaints about that business. A suggestions might be to edit the page to include information on how to request a repair. Doing so would demonstrate the both the process by which to get something fixed and that Downling does fix things. Direct confrontation of anonymous complaints seldom is as effective as a clear presentation of your side of the issue. Anyway, welcome to the wiki, may you find other pages less problematic.

20071219 15:54:44 nbsp Hi Carla, I reverted a few of your recent edits. If theres something unfactual, abusive, or fishy about a user comment, its usually best to publicly respond to their comment, or to at least give a reason for its removal. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071220 09:13:25 nbsp Hey, it might be a good idea to read the Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner wiki guide for business owners.  There are some tips for dealing with negative reviews.   Users/JabberWokky
