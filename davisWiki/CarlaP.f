20100531 04:47:01 nbsp Howdy, Carla, and welcome to the wiki.    My names Evan.  I spotted your Lost Cat notice on Wiki Spot, and moved it here to Davis Wiki in the Lost Pets entry, where it will hopefully get a better response and have more people see it.  (Wiki Spot hosts wikis from around the world, so its not really the best place for a notice).  Best of luck; I hope you find him.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
