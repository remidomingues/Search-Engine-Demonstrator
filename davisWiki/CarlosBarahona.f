20070721 19:59:49 nbsp Hey, Carlos.  I appreciate your concern on the GVCC Talk page about people using someone elses IP address.  I personally know Clifton Burton and Dale Sorbello.  I also used to go to GVCC.  And I am using my own IP address.  :)  BTW, I studied linguistics at the University of Texas, Arlington.  Worked with the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Colombia and Papua New Guinea. Users/RichLindvall
