20130312 23:12:59 nbsp Done any fishing recently? Users/MikeyCrews

20130313 09:03:54 nbsp Putah Creeks bass bite is up.
Caught this guy the other day.

  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130313 17:04:28 nbsp nice! Any stretch of water in particular you recommend? Users/MikeyCrews

20130314 00:30:20 nbsp Old Davis Road has been doing well for me. I think the stretch between it and the railroad bridge might be good too.

20130506 16:04:38 nbsp Do you know if it would be illegal to catch bass or sunfish or whatever in Putah Creek and trasnplant them to Stonegate lake? Theres a ton of carp and catfish in Stonegate but it would be more awesome if there was more a more sporting fish....IDK though, maybe the temp gets too high or 02 content gets too low in a pond like stonegate.

20130507 23:51:35 nbsp Email me at caoverstreet at sbcglobal dot net  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130531 23:23:06 nbsp It turns out there already were bass and sunfish in Stonegate Lake. Also, I saw a largish fox tonight just outside of campus near the 80113 interchange. Im thinking it was a gray fox, but am not 100% sure and I dont have pict.  Users/MikeyCrews

20130918 21:18:02 nbsp what up C to the O holding it down in yoohoo town eh? Users/StevenDaubert

20130918 21:20:47 nbsp Woo!  Nice new entry!  Although it is technically Yoohoo, not yoohoo.  Or Yahoo. Users/JabberWokky

20130918 21:21:07 nbsp Its been ages since Ive updated anything on the wiki. Figured I might as well put it to use for a favorite drink of mine. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130918 21:26:20 nbsp yeah the wok is right it has that 
the person who put me up on yoohoo passed away but I hit it up every now and then. Users/StevenDaubert

20130918 22:59:45 nbsp Aight. Changed it. JW, where are you now? You back in Davis? Thanks for adding locations Steven. I was planning on going around to the different Convenience stores at some point and cataloging who sells Yoohoo. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130919 14:05:49 nbsp I was seriously wondering about that assertion.  Either it is easier for some people who are lactose intolerant, or it was somebody who thought Yoohoo isnt made from milk. Users/JabberWokky

20140302 21:52:13 nbsp I agree with you on Krush. Theyre charging  more than B and B prices for McDonalds quality food. I actually liked the fish and chips over the crab slider (it reminded me of the McFish), but the beef sliders were pretty ordinary and the short rib slider was basically all bun. The short rib sliders from Tako in Sac have been pretty good so hopefully the new Davis location delivers.

BTW, Ive caught a couple large carp dragging plastics on the bottom of Stonegate Lake recently. Theyre not the most aggressive fighters, but they can pull around a canoe! Users/MikeyCrews

20140326 21:52:57 nbsp Sounds good. Ive not tried Tako yet. Ill have to hit them up soon. Thats awesome about the carp. What pound line are you using? Do you have a species list for stonegate lake?  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20140327 01:26:23 nbsp Honestly, I dont know what pound test Im using. It looks like about 8 or 9 # but its whatever came on the combo reel/rod I got from big5 for $20. I busted 2 of my fancy backpacking setups on consecutive trips two summers ago and have just been using the crap from big 5 since for my spin fishing (and I kind of like it since I can treat it rough and not get upset when I break it). Ive actually been fishing a fair amount in Stonegate the past couple months. Mostly just to get out on the water but Ive caught something about 1/2 the time so it keeps it interesting. So far Ive caught LargeMouth, Crappie, Channel Cats, and Carp. Ive seen some large fish aggressively hitting the surface recently and Im not sure if theyre feeding or trying to knock off parasites. Theyre long slender and golden colored so I assume theyre Channel Cats but its weird to see them up top. On a side note Ive heard accounts from multiple people of gosslings being picked off by fish so theres something pretty sizeable in that pond.   Users/MikeyCrews

20140327 22:03:22 nbsp Awesome. Whats your record for Stonegate? Users/CarlosOverstreet
