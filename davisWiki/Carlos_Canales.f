Carlos Canales is a licensed clinical psychologists who enjoys therapy at many levels. In his words, I am attentive to the complexity of treatment, attuned to the multiple layers of experience that occur when two people interact. I enjoy making connections with clients and, together, exploring what brought them to counseling, how their history informs their symptoms or present situation, and how needs are communicated. Basically, how life is experienced and observed. I also value the encounter created in the present moment by two humans invested in making changes towards health.
