The carob, or Ceratonia siliqua (Fabaceae), is a species of evergreen tree found in Davis, originally hailing from the Eastern Mediterranean region.  The tree can grow to be about 40 feet tall, and it has shiny, green leaves.  The tree bears pods that can be used as a food source.  Dried or roasted carob pods are said to taste somewhat sweet and, in addition, gum can be produced from the seeds that grow inside the pod.  The distinct smell of the trees tiny flowers, which blossom in the fall, has led some Davisites to consider it a type of Cumbleberry Trees cumbleberry tree.  The roots can cause problems, and the tree is grouped in with the list of local, invasive species.
