Im curious to know if CaroleDavis is your name, or if it is CAROLE Davis?  Users/JasonAller

There can be a great deal of sensitivity toward pseudonymity and anonymity when there are issues like the current discussion of Police oversight. It sets up the question of motive and leads to questions like:
  Who sent the flyer?
  Who is this new user calling themselves CaroleDavis?
  Why did someone spend money putting together a flyer encouraging political action without revealing their identity?
  Did the person or persons who sent the flyer hope to benefit politically, financially, or legally?
You are obviously passionate about both the Halema Buzayan case and CAROLE. I know that I wont ever know the truth about what happened, I accept that as a function of the rules that are in place. As such Im curious about those who feel that they know the truth about this case. Users/JasonAller




No one that I know, knows who sent the flyer, I imagine there are people who fear for their jobs and safety, but that is a guess.

I do want to address the Buzayan case.  I think you will know the truth about what happened in the Buzayan case because its all on tape.  Thats perhaps the most baffling part of this caseit is fairly black and white as these things go.  A couple of the big red flags on this case are the fact that the victim in this had no idea the DA was pursuing a criminal case and when she found out, she wanted no part of it.  The second red flag is the actual evidence, it just doesnt match up.  It was bumper to bumper damage and yet a highlander is not on the same level, as the car it supposedly struck.  Moreover, there was a mere singleline scratch on the highlander but a multipleline dent on the car.  Just doesnt match up.  And then from there the case gets really ugly, a lot of the stuff that will be in the civil case has not even surfaced.  Very serious violations of basic rightsattorney and mirandathat are baffling in the case of minor vehicle accident resulting in less than $1,000 of damage.


  I believe I know who you are.  I wonder if you could also create an account in your own name and feel comfortable contributing to the wiki on other issues. The wiki doesnt bite.  Users/SharlaDaly



  http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/04/02/opinion/op_ed/273oped1.txt Council responds : with the same old tired rhetoric.  The Community Advisory Committee to date has been used as an information body that receives crime reports and other updates from the police.  They have not been used in any type of advisory capacity.  The current city manager lacks any real power or backbone.  He exerts no control over the police or police chief whatsoever.  Puntillo at a recent city council meeting suggested that the city council was the ultimate police oversight body.  That in fact could not be further from the truth as they see their first duty as defending the police rather than excersing any degree of oversight over the body.  How much control does this council and city manager have, Officer Pheng Ly, the arresting officer in the Buzayan case was named Davis Police Officer of the Year.  That is an utter slap in the face to the Buzayan family.  It is an utter and complete insult.  How much more could the Davis Police Department be further discredited.


  David?  Is that you?
