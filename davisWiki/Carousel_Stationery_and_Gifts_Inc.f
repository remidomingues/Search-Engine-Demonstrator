Carousel Stationery and Gifts was a local nonchain store selling office supplies (such as file folders and paper in quantity), greeting cards, souvenirs, and gift shops decorative knickknacks, as well as traditional stationery. If they didnt have the office supplies you wanted, they often ordered them to arrive within the week.

There was a huge selection of Webkinz, Lil Kinz, Trading Cards, Clothes, Mouse Pads, and Figurines.

It was a familyowned business, and the family lived in Sacramento Elk Grove. Be sure to check out the Columbus Cafe mural on the western outside wall of the building.

Carousel will be going out of business in a few weeks. The new owners from Elk Grove never achieved the rapport with the community that the former owners had enjoyed. Users/SredniVastar

20081130 20:21:42 nbsp Im a little sad that this place is gone.  I really liked the fact that they were an oldfashioned, independent stationery store.  But the truth is that I hardly ever went in there, in part because of the location and the hours, but also because I didnt find the things I was looking for the times that I did go. Maybe it was a better store in the earlier days when it was owned by the Kanoffs and the Newtons  before my time. Users/CovertProfessor
