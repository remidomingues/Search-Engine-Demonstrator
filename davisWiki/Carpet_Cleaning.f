Rug Doctors are carpet shampoo machines.  You fill them with hot water, add a special cleaning solution, and run them over your carpet.   They have a special brush agitator on the bottom for applying the cleaner and a powerful vacuum that sucks up all the water.  Rentals are virtually the same for all stores that carry them.  Price for a regular size is $24.99/24 hours, wide track is $26.99/24 hours, optional hose attachment is $3.00.  They also typically require a $20 deposit and and ID.  Rentals are usually on a firstcome firstserved basis.  Cleaner is required and varies from $12.99/small bottle (one room) to $19.99/large bottle (two to three rooms).  Additional products like spot removers and pet stain specific items are available at even more cost.

 Working Efficiently with a Rented Carpet Shampooer 
Here are some tips for getting the most out of a rented Carpet Shampooer:
  Set Aside Enough Time to do the Job Right  A proper cleaning with a shampooer can take 13 hours per room.  If you havent done it in a while, youd be surprised how much dirt you have worked into your carpet.  It is likely you will need repeated passes to do a thorough job.  Dont expect it to be as quick as vacuuming.
  Use Your Regular Vacuum First  Vacuum the crap out of your carpet with your normal vacuum before you rent.  It will make your job a little easier.
  Know Where the Brushes Are  After you pick up your shampooer, take a moment to flip over the machine and see where the brushes are and how they work.  This will help you understand whats going on while youre running the machine.
  Switch Off Between Cleaning Solution and Hot Water  If youre doing repeated passes on a deep clean, you can save cleaning solution by doing a few runs just using hot water.  The cleaning solution is definitely good, as it helps break up the heavy stuff, but youll find you can do a lot with good hot water alone.  A typical shampoo/rinse regimen might go: Rinse, shampoo, rinse, shampoo, repeated rinses until waste water is almost clear, shampoo, rinse, dry.
  Change Direction Often   Switch up which way you pull the machine around your room.  This will let the brushes agitate in different directions and pull up more dirt.
  Lift the Handle  On the Rug Doctor, if you pull up on the handle slightly, youll apply more pressure on the brushes on the front and work them deeper into the carpet.
  Do Some Dry Runs At the End  Suck up as much water as you can at the end for a quicker dry.
