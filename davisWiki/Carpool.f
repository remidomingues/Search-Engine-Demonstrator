The term carpool has several connected meanings; an arrangement in which several participants travel together in one vehicle, sharing the costs of transportation and perhaps taking turns as the driver; a group of such people; or the special TAPS parking spaces and zones on UC Davis campus for such groups. Carpooling often implies shared commuting (a group of people making the same trip on a regular basis), while ride board rideshare/rideboards are usually used for oneoff trips.

The Davis Park and Ride was designed as a place people could park their cars and take the bus to some destination.
