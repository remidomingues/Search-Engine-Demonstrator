Cartridge World Davis is a locally owned and owner operated store that specializes in ink cartridges refilled ink cartridge refilling and toner cartridge remanufacturing for printers, fax machines and small copiers. At Cartridge World Davis, they help save consumers money while making the environmentally superior choice.

Their old location was at 516 2nd Street, next door to the old Mishkas.  As of Summer 2011, it looks like a new fish grill is opening in that location.

20081104 14:19:46 nbsp The people who work at this store are assholes and will tow your car illegally with no warning. Never park in the parking lot behind their store or you will go through hell, although I was not charged for the towing as the company that towed me realizes the girls there are nuts. Users/AllanRae

   I always thought that this particular parking lot was not a public spot. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081207 15:14:33 nbsp there are signs before you enter telling you it is for employees only Users/EricaMacGregor

20081210 10:53:37 nbsp Though we are a little wacky at CW Davis, Im not sure we qualify as NUTS. As everyone knows, parking in Davis is a huge problem. Parking in employee/staff parking keeps the businesses that pay for those spots from opening, closing and functioning smoothly throughout the day. And for a business that makes deliveries...forget about it. So, if anyone is wondering, all the spaces in this building are now occupied and all the tenants can and will tow, LEGALLY. For the gentleman complaining about being towed, there is a sign at the entrance that says the parking is for employees only. This would see to be warning enough, but weve taken further precautions. Cartridge World spaces are marked clearly with blue and yellow paint. AND, on the night in question we put an orange construction cone with a sign indicating not to park in the exact space you were towed from. What more can business owners be expected to do?

20090814 09:56:53 nbsp The staff is very friendly and even stayed open a bit later so I could refill 2 cartridges.  Great Service! I would definitly recommend them to anyone. Users/KatherineL

20100422 13:18:01 nbsp Seems like they have closed. Store is locked, no answering machine.  Users/BryanPon

20100427 14:44:17 nbsp This place is Great, I like the people who work here, and they provide Ink @ a downtown location, making it much easier to gather supplies (paper also) for someone like myself who walks / rides bike. Users/ReViewer

20100520 11:16:13 nbsp Ive been passing by hereandthere for the last 2 months and it seems like the store shut down? Always dark with blinds closed and door locked...  Users/ThUn

  Yes, whats the deal? Is it closed, or what? Users/NaBarry
   http://www.cartridgeworld.com/StoreFinder.aspx?zip95616 Store finder for zip code 95616... The Davis location doesnt show up, so thats probably a no. How unfortunate, I never had a chance to patronize their business. I still have their business card taped to the side of my desk. Users/EBT

20100621 18:00:55 nbsp They are supposedly coming back...not sure when... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100709 11:07:52 nbsp Cartridge World is reopening at 130 G Street next to Volleys under new ownership!  They should be open by Monday July 19th in their new location.  The phone number is the same 5302977200. Users/vincentc

20101115 15:32:14 nbsp I love this place! Used to buy cartridges new, but decided to try refilling so I get to recycle them AND its cheaper. Cartridge World is in this tiny little storefront next to Volleys. I called about refilling two cartridges and the girl who answered was so nice and helpful. I just picked up one and the second should be ready tomorrow. Will definitely be going back on the regular. Users/SarahdeCrescenzo

20120302 13:17:47 nbsp Great place; smaller than the original store so they have less stock, but Im still able to get quick service on almost everything I need. They almost always have the lowest cost, and have a very helpful staff and a timesaving delivery option. Although its only a few minutes bike ride for me to pick up ink and toner if I need to. Ive never had any problems using any of their recycled products. Users/sedberg

20120723 09:00:35 nbsp Cartridge World has saved me both money and time.  It is great to be able to walk in and have someone there who will help you find the right cartridge every time.   Users/JeremyTurner

20140418 16:33:37 nbsp Closed last month.  Users/MyRealName
