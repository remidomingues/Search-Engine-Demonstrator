When I was completing a remodel of my kitchen and bath on my own she was willing to work with me to find what I needed and acted as an intermediary to the installers of our countertops. She always seemed to have our satisfaction in mind and I never felt like she was trying to make a sale, just help me realize my vision for the project. She stocks a nice selection of materials and finishes in the store, and was more than happy to do some special ordering for me. I recommended her to some neighbors and they also ended up working with her on both the design and implementation of their kitchen remodel.
