Casa de Sapore is an Italian restaurant in wiki:Woodland.  It used to be called Pietros.  They serve both lunch and dinner here, and have a variety of Italian dishes, including daily specials.

The restaurant is very 70s looking on the inside, including olive green booth seating, and even one of those old now served numbers signs in the corner.


20060525 11:27:35 nbsp Casa de Sapore has better Italian food than anything Ive tried in Davis.  The bread they bring out before your meal is noteworthy, as it comes with a whipped garlic butter that is fantastic, and the Cannelloni in particular is very good.  Their dinner salads are very fresh.  If I feel like Italian, this is where I go. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060911 11:21:32 nbsp no offense to the house of flavor...but: ewww. If you consider wine by the glass of the casa de cardboard variety, strange bread accompanied by a seasoned whipped margarine, salad composed of iceberg lettuce and rock hard tomatoes to be quality Italian food then by all means this is the restaurant for you. Upon a recent visit (for some reason my companion wanted to go here instead of plainfield station) service was good except for the extremely late water glass refilling. I ordered the calamari special which I assumed would be small squid rings and tentacles but received instead a kind of steak which I would not have ordered if it had been clearly described on the menu. I dont mean to be so negative I mean, these seem like good people and they do have a full bar but youre much better off...cooking your own food at home.   Users/DianaChristofersen

Go in the restaurant and see how busy they are. Also, they nickel and dime every delivery customer they have. From not providing parmesian when customers request it, to outrageous delivery charges, to skimping on ingredients this is definately a restaurant to skip. Trust me, you wont be back. :<   Users/Holden)caulfield
