20081108 14:10:58 nbsp Hey Casey, saw your comment about the coop being the best beer in Davis...i just moved here from the midwest (right near some of the best breweries in the country) and i totally agree.  Still might have to go San Fran for the really good stuff, but its nice to have this little haven.  Russian River beers show up in a week at the coop, btw!  Users/aforbes
