la casita del cielo (the small house of the sky) was a charming, funfilled Spanish Bookstores bookstore for children in one of those little nooks and crannies downtown. Many titles were translations of English childrens classics but many more were imported directly from Spain and Latin America. The owner was Peruvian and his passion is getting kids to learn to read, speak, and write Spanish well, whether or not Spanish is their mother tongue. Bravo.

A cafes caf√© called tea list is now in this location.

No credit cards yet. Coffee was free; there was a small table with two chairs for children. CDs were available too. This store was something of a Latin American cultural center. Food was offered once a month from different Spanishspeaking countries.
