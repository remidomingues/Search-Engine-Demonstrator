Casitas Apartments, known officially as Casitas del Valle, is across Anderson Road Anderson from Chautauqua.  Like Chautauqua, it is a Tandem Properties complex and the two share a management, maintenance and landscaping crew.  Management can be found next door at the Chautauqua rental office (717 Alvarado). Residents amenity keys (given at movein) also access the pool, fitness center, and laundry room at Chautauqua.

Residents comment that they dig Casitas close proximity to shopping, bus lines, greenbelt and access to two swimming pools.  Since this complex has fully mature trees, and because it is located on the greenbelt, some residents have complained about uninvited guests with too many legs... Management has responded on this page that, Because Davis is an agricultural community, there are insect and rodent populations within the City... But, if a pest of any type has entered a resident’s home, the resident should immediately report the problem to management. We have full pest services available from a professional pest company at no expense to our residents.

20090111 21:44:03 nbsp Nice place, good location  I really like the greenbelts, and the proximity to the Anderson Shopping Center. Management is nice, and the monthly newsletters are a nice touch. Quick to repair, and the mirrored closet doors and fans in every room are pretty cool. However, my apartment has no insulation so its really hot in the summer and super cold in the winter if we dont use our heating/cooling unit. Also, the electricity is wired funny so that my roommates constantly trip the breaker if simply using the overhead lights, each a computer in each separate room, and one with a lowwattage space heater on. They each have their own room, so I cant imagine if they were sharing and there were more than one computers per room. I like this place, I only wish I could afford it next year and that it didnt hold the same temperature inside as outside all year long.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20090507 13:07:50 nbsp Not satisfied with these apartments what so ever. When I lived here recently the apartment was very run down and dirty on the inside. My carpet came with SEVERAL stains, my dishwasher fell out off the hinges, the fridge makes loud crashing sounds as if someone dropped pots and pans, I discovered ROACHES and Beetles in my place CONSTANTLY ( I slept with the lights on for god knows how long ) , and It is soooo over priced! On top of that I could hear my neighbors going to the bathroom and having simple conversations _! Lots of cars get broken into in the area as well. ( The maintenance staff however are very nice, helpful, and prompt. The office staff is pretty nice too. However, I think that people have the right to know what they are getting themselves into when they move here. Its a nice location near the shopping centers but if i were you id seriously go ask people in the apartments living there now how they like it over all before signing anything.  Users/AnastaciaSmith

20090507 13:18:56 nbsp this place is okay minus the roaches, beetles, and flies lol ! Maintenace is awesome but the wiring in the place trips out a lot so you have to reset the breakers....! You get access to two pools though thats a plus. I live here now and I have to relate to Anastacia I sleep with my lights on too !! Rather pay that extra buck then get bugs on me lol! No pets is a drag but whatever. The apartments need SERIOUS updates on the inside like carpeting, cabinets, ect. My neighbors practically live with me cause i can hear their every move and when they take a shower, i have to wait for the hot water to return (lame)! The greenbelt is beautiful and located sooo close to the apartments! I am moving out after my lease because i found a place in the colleges for cheaper than what i am paying here.  Users/NCH

20090508 11:53:16 nbsp Dear Residents, Because Davis is an agricultural community, there are insect and rodent populations within the City.  As a management team, we maintain our buildings, trim back our landscaping, and utilize pest mitigation practices in an effort to keep the creatures of the outdoors from entering apartment interiors.  But, if a pest of any type has entered a resident’s home, the resident should immediately report the problem to management. We have full pest services available from a professional pest company at no expense to our residents.  The pest company will work with the resident to resolve the issue.  But, if a resident accepts the situation as normal and does not report the problem to management, we have no way of knowing that the problem in their apartment exists.  Please CONTACT THE OFFICE when you have a pest or maintenance problem.  We’re here to help.  If you don’t let us know you’re not happy, we can’t fix it. :) Users/ChautauquaManagement

20090921 11:05:23 nbsp It has been a few months since I moved here into a 1bedroom apartment.  So far no electrical, bugs, or security issues.  Maintenance has been great and even remembered a past maintenance issue which helped solve a more recent one.  Management has also been great.  While Im not used to a team that takes care of over a hundred units and two properties, most of them know my name and apartment number.  Always nice.  Only hickups were paint spatters on my carpet (but difficult to see except with close inspection), and very dirty A/C and bathroom vent; certainly overlooked by the contracted cleaning team.  Laundry machines are serviced by Web Laundry Service.  They were a bit slow getting out here (next day) but the serviceman was very nice and provided a refund for the trouble that I had.  Facilities are well maintained and grounds crew seem to have pride in this property since it is kept quite clean.  Id love to see thermal efficient windows as the frames on the current ones can nearly burn you when closing windows that have sat in the sun for just a short while! Thats a lot of solar energy entering my apartment!  But the blinds help keep things cool otherwise and adding blackout curtains insulates even more.  The A/C works fairly well but a small fan is recommended to direct cool air into the bedroom for the 1bed apartments.  Closely related, having a ceiling fan in the bedroom was a major factor in choosing this apartment!  The kitchen is very efficient in usage of space and makes you think hard about how best to place culinary equipment.  It is unfortunate, however, that there is not an outlet on the kitchen side of the bar near the phone outlet for a home phone, coffee maker, or other small appliance.  Otherwise there are plenty of grounded outlets to plugin to.  The linen closet between the bathroom and bedroom is a lifesaver... I dont know how I got along without one.  My particular bathroom lacks a medicine cabinet but that is okay since there is a ton of counter, drawer, and cabinet space.  Having two towel racks is really nice.  The environment surrounding the complex is relatively quiet; coming from my previous apartment, it is like a library here.  But your mileage will certainly vary.  All around, a pretty nice and efficient 1Bedroom with great staff.  The free DSL makes even faster DSL cheaper although max throughput speeds seem to vary greatly day to day which can be frustrating.  Still, it is a pretty dang good value.  Ill check back after 6 months or a year if my experiences change. Users/RyanMikulovsky

LOCATION: Awesome.  As mentioned, its located right on a greenbelt.  Biking and busing distance from the UC Davis campus.  Walking distance from SaveMart and the surrounding food quart.  Biking distance from Safeway and the surrounding food quart.  Three major buslines go by  J Bus Line J (to the Silo), G Bus Line G and F Bus Line F (both to the MU).  If you need to drive, then there are nearby gas stations as well.
MANAGEMENT: I love Casitas management!  They respond to requests promptly, and all the workers are friendly and approachable. On Thanksgiving this year, they provided a free Thanksgiving feast (turkey, stuffing, potatoes, the works!) for their residents, on a first come, first serve basis.  And on finals week, they gave out free breakfast!
ACTUAL APARTMENTS: I live in a 2 bed/1.5 bath townhouse.  The apartments themselves are not too amazing,  but do keep in mind that these are old buildings to begin with.  Bring a vacuum.  Paint chips off from the ceilings in little flakes occasionally (this mostly matters if you have the top bunk of a bunk bed, or if youre planning on buying one of those tall desk/bed combos).  The kitchen comes with an electric stove, oven, microwave, dishwasher... the sink for us is a bit shallow, but its workable.  Turn on the bathroom fan after taking a shower, or you will get mold (theres no other ventilation)!
BUGS: Many bugs lay eggs in rotten food thats left out.  In the fall, because Davis farms often have a surplus of tomatoes that rot, there tends to be a lot of flies.  One of the ways to prevent the flies from getting out of control is to have separate garbage cans (one under the sink for vegetable peels and rotten food, and one not under the sink for anything else).  Also, if you see a spider, dont squish it.  Just bring it outside, and itll catch flies for you.
AMENITIES: The internet in the study room hasnt been working; this lack of internet has actually turned out to be a GOOD thing for my personal study habits, as I tend to Facebook and email more than I ought to.  However, just keep in mind that youll want to download class lectures or whatever BEFORE you go into the study room.... unless the internet gets fixed soon.  There are several laundry rooms, currently $1.25 to wash and $1 to dry.  If you make a friend in one of the nearby complexes, I hear that its $0.75 for washing and $0.75 for drying (but those machines might be smaller/older).  I havent used the pool yet, but I may use it soon, with the nice spring weather that were having.
NEIGHBORS: Our neighbors seem nice, and the parties dont sound too frequent or outofcontrol.  However, the walls are not very soundproof  mainly the front walls (with the windows/doors) of the townhouses.  So if you have the urge to have a loud conversation about how drunk you are at 2am, do that indoors.  This is really just common courtesy. Users/Myself

20100405 15:57:58 nbsp Hi Myself,

Were happy to hear that you love management!  We love our residents too! We dont generally hear complaints about paint falling from the ceiling.  Please contact the office so we can better help you troubleshoot the problem.  We did have someone contact the office about the Casitas internet this week.  Omsoft has been out and the problem has been fixed.  If you continue to have trouble, please dont hesitate to let us or Omsoft know.  If we dont know youre having problems, we cant fix them. ;) Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100630 01:11:31 nbsp I love living at Casitas, but I have one major complaint, and it isnt the managements fault at all. I live in apartment #45, and Im not sure if its just the trees around my area, but this problem persisted when I lived here in 2007 in apartment #52. The birds chirp from the hours of midnight to 5am. Every. Night. I dont know if these birds are blind, but they definitely have some serious issues. Personally, I find it disconcerting and have to wear earplugs...theres something strange about hearing birds at that time of night, perhaps just completely conflicting with circadian rhythms. I wish they didnt chirp from the hours of midnight to 5am, but they certainly do. Users/RandallWilson

20110112 10:58:15 nbsp Looking to sublease 1br in a 3br/1.5bth townhouse now until end of August. Great location, very responsive and friendly management and maintenance staff. Two female undergraduate roommates, clean and quiet. Contact sam.tin.13@gmail.com for more information! Users/SamTin

20120207 19:01:04 nbsp Alright, since the floor plan is incredibly blurry I have measured the master bedroom for the 3 bedroom 1.5 bath townhome! It is...10ft by 15ft! That includes the closet. Also the management has completely changed this year, and the new management seems competent and friendly. Users/DECarter

20120313 10:00:03 nbsp Ive been here two years and Its pretty nice. Very reasonable prices for Davis when you take into account the pool(s) and exercise room and other amenities. The building date from the 70s so the walls and windows are a bit thin, but the neighbors quiet down reasonably well.  Users/MyRealName

20120315 11:59:20 nbsp As a long time Daviswiki Lurker, I feel I should give a DISCLAIMER: this is about to turn into a rant.

My roommates and I have been here for over a year, I guess this is our second year here? We are NOT renewing next year.

Why we decided not to renew:
1. Bug problem has NEVER been taken care of completely. You try living with cockroaches for two years and being told its normal because its Davis. My friends who live across the street dont have ANY cockroaches. I am calling BS here.
2. Of the two maintenance guys weve dealt with, only one of them ever seemed to listen or care about us. The other oneshort, squat guywould say oh I fixed it and then wed look and it wasnt fixed and wed tell him and hed brush us off.
3. We really dont feel like weve been heard. You would think that as a good business practice youd want to take care of your residents. I feel like the new office people (staffing sure has changed A LOT recently) are trying, but that its too late to fix the damage done.

Why we lived here at all... location is great. Price was decent. Now, of course, we feel totally ripped off.

If youre looking to live here... good luck. Dont live in our building.

 Users/JQuest

20120326 09:36:25 nbsp Hi JQuest,

We are very sorry to hear of your unfortunate experience at Casitas.

Our management team works hard with our pest team to oversee an integrated pest management program that is meant to keep pests away without overexposing our residents and the environment to an excessive amount of pesticides. Normally, this program works well to keep insects and other pests outside where they belong. Unfortunately, problems can happen when a household in a building allows any breach of that barrier and leaves the problem unreported, allowing it to grow and spread. In such a circumstance, problems can become larger and harder to solve by the time management becomes aware.

We are have been alerted about a few instances of this in the current lease term and are incorporating new pest methods that seem to be resolving the issue. Additionally, we are implementing a new inspection program that should help us better detect and mitigate any problems in the future. As a means of evaluating our maintenance service, we are incorporating a new callback program as a part of our maintenance plan. We have been randomly selecting households and calling to follow up in regards to customer satisfaction.

If you have any issues with our office, pest, or maintenance personnel, PLEASE do not hesitate to inform our office staff. We want to deliver only the best service to our community, and your feedback helps us stay on point.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention and we truly hope we can make the rest of your stay with us a terrific experience.

Best,
Casitas Management Users/CasitasManagement

20120403 22:18:59 nbsp ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DO NOT LIVE HERE!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Ive been having the same situation as JQuest. Cockroaches have been coming out of the walls since October and management has not made any serious attempts to solve the problem.  Every two weeks or so the same pest control company comes in to lay new traps and spray the baseboards, but they do nothing to root out the source of the roaches.

After contacting tandem properties about the issue, they replaced the bathroom floors and baseboards to seal any cracks. Now the cockroaches are showing up in the bedrooms and they are still going unchecked in between the walls of the apartments.
This is completely unacceptable.


READ THE ABOVE REVIEWS THROUGHLY. COCKROACHES HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM HERE FOR YEARS AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT. Users/ToddKaiser

20120403 22:50:30 nbsp I enjoy living here, its a nice complex as far as apartments go in Davis. However, weve had a cockroach problem since our second month living here. Casitas management has confirmed, by inspection of all the attached units, that this problem originated in a unit that is attached to ours.

We contacted Casitas early on, and theyve come in a sprayed multiple times over the continuing duration of our residency (at least once every two weeks), but the cockroaches keep returning. Management refuses to do anything more than having pest control come in to spray once a week because it would affect all of the units attached to our building. Casitas management has been fairly considerate about the issue, but has failed to solve the problem, four months after we first noticed. Perhaps they are more interested in filling next years empty units than solving a persisting issue that will only continue after we leave. We are not renewing our lease and some unlucky person will take it over if this issue is not taken care of. Its only fair that potential residents of my apartment know about this problem because we were definitely not informed of this cockroach problem existed before we moved in. And as the busy college students that we are, we would just rather not have to deal with this problem to say the least.

Other than living with cockroaches in the walls that often spill out into our home, the amenities they provide are top notch, aside from the rusty mailboxes. Its nice to have our packages waiting at the office since were usually not home during the day, and they have an awesome lighted, color changing pool. Amenities aside, I personally dislike living with pests, especially cockroaches. So despite how nice everything else may seem to be, my onestar review will stay for now. Updates to come.

20120406 11:18:36 nbsp Dear Todd and David,

We are determined to resolve your pest problem and satisfy your needs. When a pest issue is reported in a building, management works with all households in the building to detect and eliminate the source of the problem as quickly as possible. Not all households in the instance mentioned here were comfortable consenting to chemical treatment. Consequently, we did have to turn to integrated (non chemical) methods which, happily, do appear do be working, but did take a bit longer to eliminate the source than any of us would have liked.

We have tried our best in this situation to respect the needs and wishes of all households involved while working to remedy your pest concern as quickly as possible. We are genuinely sorry that our efforts have left you unsatisfied. This particular pest situation was an especially unusual circumstance. Our apartments are regularly inspected for pest issues and we would never move any household into an apartment with a known pest concern. We hope that as a resident who has gotten to know our team and Tandems commitment to resident care, that you believe that to be true. Were glad to hear that despite your frustration, you still have had some good experiences at Casitas.

Upon Mondays inspection of your unit, it appeared that the problem was contained, but as you are clearly still understandably frustrated, we worked this week on coming up with new options for you and have attempted to contact you to go over these. While we understand your frustrations with your experience at Casitas, as we said, we are determined to resolve your pest problem and satisfy your needs. Please get in touch with us when you can.

Sincerely,
Casitas Management

20121207 14:41:01 nbsp We have lived in our current appt for 5 years now, and had lived in Chautauqua for 2 years before that.  Great amenities and location for the price (2 pools, 2 hottubs, 2 study lounges, 24 hours gym!)!  Management team has changed over the years, but the current one has done a fantastic job with anything we bring to them.  The maintenance team does a fine job of getting to any work orders weve put in quickly and efficiently.  Ive read some of the reports of bug problems, and have never had one myself (other than the few randoms that happen being right by the greenbelt and farmlands).  Have enjoyed living here for the past 5 years, and have plans to continue renewing our lease for as long as we are at Davis. Users/GFlener

20130121 22:38:04 nbsp Maintenance is really fast, usually the same day. The complex and pools are always clean. I dont really like the layout of the 3 bed 1 1/2 bath townhouse though. The house is kind of cramped. The walls are really thin. I can hear everything that happens in the room next door (good thing nothing much happens in there). The upstairs bathroom is really weird. I rather they put the 2 sinks in the same area and make the bathroom larger. Such a waste of space to make 2 separate areas for 2 sinks. The kitchen would have more room if the removed the laundry room also but I guess Casitias is more for families than students. I chose casitas because another housemate really wanted to live here. The color of the whole complex is really not that visually appealing either.  Users/shacheung

20130312 11:07:17 nbsp If you like sleep, DONT LIVE HERE. You get a 7 AM wake up call TuesdayFriday from either a leaf blower, weed whipper, lawn mower, or garbage truck. And they like to move slow so it lasts allllll morning. It seriously sucks. I never understood why they couldnt start in the afternoon considering college students get little sleep to begin with...seriously SO ANNOYING. Youve been warned. Users/kelby

20130314 15:11:40 nbsp Hi Kelby, Im sorry for your frustrations. Companies that do landscaping maintenance often start early to allow them to get through all the work at multiple large properties and for the safety of their workers (it can be really tough on their staff to do yard work during the heat of the day.) While we cant make too many adjustments that prevent our landscapers ability to maintain the property, sometimes Im able to ask them to avoid starting in certain areas when a resident has a particular scheduling need. Please come chat with me when you have a moment and lets work together to see how I can help you get some more sleep. Take care.  Users/KerryK

20130603 21:44:45 nbsp I agree with Kelby about landscaping. Its horrible living facing the greenbelt the landscaping takes 1/2 a day. I wake up with a headache every tuesday. Also, its annoying that I cant keep my windows open without bugs flying into my room and theres no AC in the townhouses. the walls are paper thin. I can hear my housemate cough, sneeze, and her coffee machine running. The front door is the MOST annoying of all. Its so loud when it closes. I have to close it very lightly to make no noise. the 3 bedrooms townhouses are really cramped too. The fitness center is nice but theres no free weights.  Users/shacheung

20130606 13:24:17 nbsp Hi shacheung,

Thank you again for bringing your concerns to my attention here. Per our conversation yesterday and today, all apartments at Casitas have air conditioning and we have discovered that your units AC is in fact not working at this time.  The maintenance requests we talked about were submitted yesterday and our team checked on them for you. The kitchen burner and your front door are both in good working order now. Our AC technician will be by this afternoon to work on the broken parts of the AC unit. If you have any concerns, or if anything new comes up, please feel free to let us know. We are happy to help remedy any problems for you as soon as we are aware of them. Im so glad we saw your post and hopefully we will be able to help you feel more comfortable soon. Good luck with studying for finals!

Take care.

20130622 16:45:28 nbsp Correcting my previous post, our unit does have AC but we just assumed that there was none because we read somewhere on their website or lease or move in packet that some units have fans and others, AC. I gotta praise their superfast maintenance and even faster replies to comments on this page. Users/shacheung

20130820 18:22:49 nbsp Im about to move out after 3 years of residency in Casitas.  1 year in the 3 bd 2 bath singlestory townhome and 2 years in the 3 bd 1.5 bath townhome.  Management is super friendly.  Repair requests were done very promptly (almost always same day) and the maintenance team is all super friendly.

G and J bus lines run often and will get you to either of campus 2 bus terminals (Memorial Union and Silo, respectively).  Weve rarely had noise issues as long as we didnt blast music with all of our windows open.  The Savemart and Safeway shopping centers are both ridiculously close and downtown is a quick drive down Covell and F st.

The pool is kept clean.  The hottub is almost always kept heated.  There are plenty of laundry facilities/units.  Youre adjacent to the Greenbelt which is awesome for running.  I never used the study rooms but they were clean and frequented by a lot of the other tenants.

No real complaints about this place.  Highly recommended. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20130908 15:20:02 nbsp When I moved into this apartment, the carpet is not clean with some dirty spots, there are also FLEAS in my house, the Stoves and Oven are not working. The fan seems about to fall down when it is turned on, the wall in the storage room is broken, full of spider webs, spiders ( palm size) and trash. Some of the shelves in cabinets are getting off. I complained to the apartment a week ago. They NEVER come to fix it or replace anything. Without the oven and stoves, I have to buy my meal from restaurant every single day. This apartment disappointed me. Well, this apartment has good location and transportation, but for maintenance it is something that you should hesitate and think about.  Users/KingMa

20130909 15:59:46 nbsp Hi KingMa,

Thank you for bringing this situation to our attention in the office this morning. Im so sorry to hear that we missed your maintenance request last weekthe work order was given to maintenance, marked as a priority, and intended to be completed same day. Sal (our maintenance supervisor) was in your apartment today to address all your maintenance concerns. So far, it looks like the stove and oven were noted as working when they were inspected by maintenance last week and it seems that the issue is actually due to the circuit breaker being tripped in your apartment. Please keep me posted on how things progress after Sals visit again today. And like we talked about, please bring me your restaurant receipts so we can reimburse you for having to eat out while you waited for the the repairand, in the future, please feel free to use our afterhours emergency maintenance line if weve missed you so you wont have to do that. We never want you to have to wait with an nonworking stove or oven.

For the carpet, the small spots near the laundry area are bleach marks and those wont come out. It is noted on your inspection sheet so you wont have to worry about that at moveout. Just to be sure things are as clean as possible for you though, weve scheduled for your carpet to be recleaned.

As we talked about, I also have a call into our pest company to schedule a visit as soon as possible to look into your concerns there is no record of prior issues with fleas in your apartment during any of our inspections, so thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. Please let me know how you are doing while you wait for his visit. I dont want you to feel you have to remain uncomfortable if things change.

Im so sorry again that things were missed and we are determined to make them better for you. Please dont hesitate to tell me what else I can do to helpwe want for you to enjoy your new home.

Take care,
