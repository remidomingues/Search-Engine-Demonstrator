20110904 12:20:53 nbsp I saw something the other night that I hadnt seen before.  It was maybe a quad runner pulling a Casson and Son equipment trailer with some guys around in a back parking lot of The Colleges at La Rue.  My condolences regarding your family member who was killed in a traffic accident on a county road a few years ago. Users/BruceHansen
