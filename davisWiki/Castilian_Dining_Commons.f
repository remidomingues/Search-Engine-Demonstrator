The Castilian Dining Commons was the baby brother/sister of the Oxford Circle Dining Commons and was built so that Castilian Hall residents would not have to walk a ways every time they wanted food. Selection was typically more limited here. However, it did not make ones clothes smell awful as the Oxford Circle Dining Commons OCDC often did.

The Castilian DC used to be open starting with Sunday dinners through Friday dinners. It was closed on Saturdays and early Sunday. This required residents to walk to the OCDC.

Following the closure of OCDC for renovations, this dining commons opened fulltime to serve all of Cuarto.

Starting Monday May 18, 2009: Castilian Dining Room had been open on the weekends for brunch & dinner.

After the remodeling of OCDC was completed, this dining commons was decommissioned in 2010 and all Castilian residents had to walk to the OCDC for their meals. It was followed by the Hall in 2011.

But, if you are from another dorm or from off campus, this locker service is very convient. By the way, the staff at castillian are very very friendly. Its a good place to go for lunch.
