Castilian Hall was one of the Cuarto area Dorms. Like other Cuarto buildings, Castilian was not located on Campus like other Freshmen freshman living areas, but was located on Wake Forest Drive close to 8th St..

Castilian had its own Castilian Dining Commons Dining Commons (about 30 seconds to a minute away walking) in addition to the nearby Oxford Circle Dining Commons (about a 5 minute walk). Castilian Hall was divided into two halves: Castilian North and Castilian South. Both featured their own pools, spas, and laundry rooms, with the only difference being the proximity of Castilian South to the Castilian Dining Commons Dining Commons and its game area. Each carpeted and airconditioned unit in Castilian was actually a suite with a living room, one or two bathrooms, and anywhere from two to four bedrooms. Each suite could accommodate up to twelve students and the residence hall houses a total of 450 students.  The pictures below are from a 3 room suite with 2 doubles and 1 single bedroom in Castilian South.
As of the 20102011 school year, the Castilian Dining Commons is nonexistent.
It was easy for Castilian to feel like a really just a big Apartments apartment complex, and that was because it used to be one!  The UC Davis University purchased the thenapartment complex off of someone and outfitted it to be a Dorms residence hall.  You could have seen photos of the old apartmentstyle setup in the main area where the Area Service Desk used to be.  Compared to many of the other dorms, Castilian was fairly quiet and could have been seen as a good place to get schoolwork done.

At the close of the 20102011 school year, Castilian Hall was no longer used for student housing. Student Housing decided that necessary renovations were too costly and will instead sell or redevelop the buildings into private housing, according to the http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/about/strategic_plan/08_capital_projects.htm strategic plan.
