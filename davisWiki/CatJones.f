20091123 17:49:33 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  You might also want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  I noticed that you deleted some of the text on The Paint Chip page and also that you added to the Green and local gift ideas page  I deleted your addition there because it was much longer than the others and because you didnt make it clear why it was relevant to the page.  Something shorter and more clearly relevant might work.  Please understand that the wiki is meant to reflect the views of the community, not the views of one person or business.  Also, since it is meant to be a resource, we tend to avoid things that read as advertisements.  But additional information about businesses and other aspects of Davis (schools, parks, etc.!) is always welcome.  I hope that you stick around and contribute to the wiki about many Davis topics.

Im sure The Paint Chip would love to be a part of anything Davis Wiki puts together for this holiday season, and now that we have a clearer idea of what youre looking for, well be sure to follow the rules!

20100831 19:04:16 nbsp As for the editing of the content on The Paint Chips page, I did so because the information was outdated and had not been edited since the store ownership turned over. Users/CatJones
