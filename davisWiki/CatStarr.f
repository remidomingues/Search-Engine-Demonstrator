Users/CatStarr Ms. Caitlin Cat Starr is an essential puzzle piece of the Davis community. She is a beautiful writer, a music lover, a dreamer, a mermaid.

She worked at Americana Arms Apartments as the Office Manager, & has dedicated far too much of her time to her work. Friends are beginning to complain.

Her interests include musicals, world domination, pearls, cowboys, true love, zombies, & disneyland.

She knows when to be serious, but she also knows how to have fun better than almost anyone! Her giggle is contagious, & so is her smile. Lately her hair has been varying shades of red, but it has been every color of the rainbow! She is loud & proud & utterly charming. She likes fancyfancydesigner things but isnt above shopping at Walmart for a good deal. If you are ever in need of a good hug, shell be there with open arms.
