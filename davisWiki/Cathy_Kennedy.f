 Campaign Literature 



20080602 01:50:22 nbsp Kennedy is the Republican candidate for County Supervisor. She registered over to decline to state less than three months ago. While I agree she has a compelling story, she is not the right candidate for supervisor, especially given the credentials of John Ferrera Ferrera and Jim Provenza Provenza. Users/MaxMikalonis

20081115 15:32:11 nbsp Kennedy is a combo; certainly fiscally conservative; but certainly a social liberal. This lady grew up in social poverty, freely admits that she was a welfare child; put herself through school; takes in children; seems to be rather savvy on business and political issues. With the layout of the BOS, she would be a very compelling addition. Yolo has 4 men and 1 woman; 2 lawyers, 2 professional politicians and 1 farmer. Kennedy does not need Ferrera and Provenza credentials  they are weak. Provenza did a bang job on the school board, and Ferrera has nothing but Califonia Budget experience  like thats a bragging point. Kennedy has fire and doesnâ€™t seem to pander to anyone unlike what weve all seen from Ferrera and Provenza. True the race is done  she entered too late. Kennedy should run for something else but, she might be more than little Yolo can comprehend    Users/YoloPeep
