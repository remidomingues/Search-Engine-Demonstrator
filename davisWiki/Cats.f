Davis is full of furry felines and felinecentered people. Some are Town Fauna domesticated, while others are Feral Cats without a home. It is also home to many cat experts and outreach organizations. Please keep in mind that cats are obligate carnivores and cannot live a vegetarians vegetarian or vegan lifestyle; they derive their energy from quality animal protein. Meow. Meow.
