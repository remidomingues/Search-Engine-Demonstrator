20060711 20:00:42 nbsp Go there if you like meat. Great prime rib. The 24 0z tbone is staggering (if you live through it you wont need to eat for another week!). If you want to eat anything other than meat, STAY AWAY!!! Users/DavidDeCristoforo

20060712 15:34:37 nbsp I love a good steak, and I didnt care much for their food.  After hearing so much about it, I was disappointed.  Bigger isnt always better. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060712 16:06:06 nbsp I believe Cattlemens is a very good steak.  And Im not alone in this belief; the Dixon cattlemens has quite a few newspaper and magazine reviews and comparisons which consistantly place them on par with or above many of the expensive fancy restaurants.  I recommend the Petes special if youre not into the 24ozer: $17 or so for steak, drink (soda, beer or house wine), bottomless salad, bread, beans and the usual sides.  Users/JaimeRaba

20060714 22:37:25 nbsp Been here several times and will continue to go back.  Good food, good service, tables large enough for a party and small enough for a couple, and yummy desserts.  downside is that it is a tad on the expensive side.  they also have a decent bar. Users/HollywoOd

20060811 23:11:02 nbsp Their twice baked potatoes are awesome and the steak is spectacular. However, their BBQ ribs are nothing amazing. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20071218 15:10:02 nbsp I know its crazy to go there for chicken, but the Dakota Chicken is delicious!  Users/Kiran

20080603 13:12:40 nbsp i agree with the previous entry, bbq beef ribs are all right, not exactly amazing.  i went monday night for the $1/rib night and was a little disappointed.  it was really backed up (i think some fraternities/sororities were having an event there) and the waitresses were completely in over their heads.  there wasnt a waitress to one table, so about 6 different waitresses would come to your table asking different things.  Not only that, they were all in such a hurry it was almost impossible to flag one down to clear the table, much less take an order.  When my ribs came, they were room temperature, and by the time i was on my 3rd rib, they were cold.  I was pretty disappointed after waiting in line for about 20 minutes behind some obnoxious people, waiting 10 more minutes to get my table cleaned, and then waiting for a waitress to take my order.  maybe they were having an off night, i dont know. but that entire experience wasnt even worth the fact that I paid $5 for my meal.

20080603 16:15:37 nbsp I think you were there on an off night.  Ive been eating at the  Dixon Cattlemens for, literally, ten years (maybe more).  Every single time Ive been there, the food was excellent and the service was attentive, but not overbearing.  Now, there were a few times we had to wait for a table and it took a while, but thats because the place was packed (like Friday and Saturday nights).  It was understandable give the circumstances.
I actually prefer going when its empty.  You dont wait and since there is plenty of staff, they cant do enough for you.  Users/CurlyGirl26

20080603 16:16:15 nbsp Oh and Ive had practically everything on their menu.  Im big eater. Users/CurlyGirl26

20091111 11:32:01 nbsp Love it! They have plentiful seating and yet I have often waited for half an hour for a table because this place is so very popular. The prices are reasonable considering the portions and that salad, beans, and bread come standard with every meal. Users/GJC02

20100313 16:08:46 nbsp DO NOT GO TO CATTLEMENS!!!


WORST STAFF ON THE PLANET!!!

 While coming out of the restroom I witnessed the hostesses heckling customers as they walked by. Making fun of customers weight, facial features, clothes and the way they talk. I filed a complaint and the manager calls me, wastes my time and tells me it didnt happen. I REALLY hate being called a liar, but wasting my cell time to insult me further.  Users/Dozer

Enjoyed a nice diner. Staff was helpful and the food arrived fairly quick. I ordered one of the specials (Wishkey peppercorn steak) and it was delicious and just the right size for me (10 oz). Ill go back.  Users/JulioD
