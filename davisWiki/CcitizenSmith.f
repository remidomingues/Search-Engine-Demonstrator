20080512 09:37:15 nbsp Sure the vendors think the Karma patrol is a joke, but without them there wouldnt be a WEF for you to place your both up at. They do a ton of labor setting up and taking down. You should thank them, even if you secretly despise them and there stupid hippie rules. They get YOU alot of money.

Consider the importance of using your real name, Then I would actually put some stock in what you say. Users/StevenDaubert
