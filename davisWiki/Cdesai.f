20100206 00:16:02 nbsp You created a page about ASUCD candidate Adam Thongsavat on the Wiki Spot hub wiki. That wiki is for the wiki spot project, not Davis. I deleted the page. You can find the last version of the page http://wikispot.org/Adam_Thongsavat?actionraw&version5 here. I invite you to recreate the page on Davis Wiki. Users/WilliamLewis
