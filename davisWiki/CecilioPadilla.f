Im a 2007 graduate of Davis Senior High DHS. I also went to Holmes Junior High School back when the mascot was still the Minutemen (they changed it to the Patriots when I was in 8th grade), and Cesar Chavez Elementary School when it was still called WDE (they changed it when I was 2nd grade).

Like a true Townies Davisite I was born in Woodland because, back in the day, Davis didnt have a hospital.

I attended UC Davis, majoring in Political Science. I also went to Sacramento City College from 20072010, although I took most of my classes at the main campus because the old Davis Center reminded me of a doctors office.

I love my dog Chewy and my kitties Precious and Milky.

Ive been working at KOVR CBS13 as a web producer. Ive also worked at KTXL FOX40, The Aggie, AggieTV, the City of Davis as a facility attendant, Stones Cafe & Catering, and interned at the Yolo County Visitors Bureau. Ill also never forget my time at The HUB in high school...
