Cedar Park is a one of many fine neighborhood parks in Davis; perhaps it may the smallest! Situated between a leafy East Davis residential area and the Davis Korean Church, this shady nook is enjoyed by both Korean churchgoers and area neighbors, especially on hot summer afternoons.

All of the playground equipment is made out of recycled materials.
