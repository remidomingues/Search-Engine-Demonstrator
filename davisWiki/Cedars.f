Cedars are attractive, pleasantsmelling conifers. The needles are shorter than those of Pines.  You should point them out by extending an arm, index finger directed at one and loudly exclaiming See deres a tree.

 Species 

And where you can find them.

  Atlas Cedar  There are some big ones around the Memorial Union and on the north side of the Quad.
  Deodar Cedar  Also known as the California Christmas Tree. They can be grown from cuttings; intriguingly, cuttings from the trees top branches will grow tall and straight, while cuttings from the older, horizonal bottom branches will grow more outward and twisted, resulting in a drooping, gnarled, spooky tree that looks something from a Tim Burton movie.
  Incense Cedar  These are a big deal up in the mountains. The bark is reddish and a bit shreddedlooking. The tree smells nice.
