Celebrate Davis! is an annual free communitywide festival organized by the Davis Chamber of Commerce. It is part picnic, part music festival, part business expo. Visit community businesses and organizations at their booths, buy dinner, enjoy live music, and watch fireworks at 9PM. Parking near Celebrate Davis! is very hard to find.  It is definitely an event to Bicycling bike to (free valet bike parking is available), walk to or take the public transportation.

Every year, the fireworks catch some people and their dogs by surprise; unlike the 4th of July, which most everyone knows about and on which day most everyone expects July 4th Fireworks fireworks, many people dont know about Celebrate Davis! or know that there will be fireworks.  Dogs have been known to panic and bolt, and some are never found.  So, some Davisites have suggested that the fireworks be eliminated from the event, especially given the bad economy; see, for example, http://www.davisenterprise.com/opinion/letters/stopfireworksforpetssake/ here, http://www.davisenterprise.com/opinion/cantwecelebratedavisanotherway/ here, and http://www.davisenterprise.com/opinion/letters/iagreestopthefireworks/ here.

If ever there was a good venue to Wiki Flyer flyer and be visible at for Davis Wiki...

Does anyone have the capability to have a laptop online there in the park?

I remember reading in the paper {two years ago} that a lot of dog owners felt they were not properly warned about the fireworks.  Dogs got scared, people got upset.  So remember, dog owners, there will be fireworks  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

20080312 19:15:40 nbsp This year Celebrate Davis will be Celebrate UC Davis, in honor of the centennial. Users/EliYani

20100513 21:22:02 nbsp Wow... extremely loud fireworks after 9 pm on a random Thursday evening. Maybe thats a great way for people at the festival to celebrate Davis, but for those of us sick in bed with a final tomorrow who have the misfortune of living next to Community Park, its really just a nuisance to be woken up like that. Warnings to nearby homeowners would be appreciated in the future.  Users/km2012

  Your username makes me think that you should know more things about the city of Davis. Users/hankim

20100917 15:26:25 nbsp The fireworks start at about 9:00 and last about 1015 minutes. Although loved by many, they are disruptive for a few dogs and sleeping humans every year.  The Chamber of Commerce does distribute announcement flyers to all residents within a certain number of blocks of the event (the radius is dictated by the City), and also publicizes the event as much as possible in the Davis Enterprise and via posters in the windows of local businesses.

20120517 21:07:34 nbsp Props to this page. I was just reading a bedtime story, with the dogs curled up nearby, when fireworks started. A visit to this page cleared up the mystery for me and my daughter. I can verify that they go off at 9pm. This year, the fireworks lasted just 5 minutes. Users/DataNotGuesswork

20120518 00:35:42 nbsp They started right about 9pm.  We were passing by the high school fields on Covell, and the very sudden flashes and bangs were pretty startling. Users/TomGarberson
