Celeste Rose is a former UCD Administrative Officers Vice Chancellor who was at the center of an executive compensation controversy in 2005 and 2006.

In Spring of 2005, Rose was asked to resign from her post as UCD Administrative Officers Vice Chancellor for University Relations. She claimed she was being discriminated against on the basis of her race and gender. A December 2005 investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle revealed that Larry Vanderhoef Chancellor Vanderhoef offered her a compensation package, behind closed doors, to prevent a lawsuit. The package guaranteed her two years as an advisor to the chancellor with a salary of $205,000, with no work requirements and no possibility of termination. In addition, she received $50,000 to help her find new employment. She also retained her former benefits, such as a growing pension, severance pay, and health care.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle: The salary and transition payment alone add up to $460,000. In addition, it could potentially give her an additional $20,500 in severance and boost her annual pension by as much as $17,000 a year.

Rose is married to a legislative aide of an assemblyman who is a member of the Black Caucus in Californias state legislature. Vanderhoef claims he http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/14146927p14975271c.html received calls from the caucus asking that Rose be treated fairly. The caucus denied this.

The controversy resulted in an unsuccessful vote of no confidence for Vanderhoef by the Academic Senate.

Rose was also the first black woman appointed to the http://ncaa.org/ NCAAs senior management staff in 1997.

20060127 21:08:09 nbsp What a douchebag. Its nice to see how so many people sacrificed during the civil rights movement so Rose can drop a discrimination lawsuit for money and a job with the people she accused of being racist and sexist. Did those people stop becoming racist and sexist after parting with taxpayer/student money? Too bad MLK Jr. didnt know about the redeeming power of money...couldve saved him a lot of trouble and speechmaking. Users/ApolloStumpy

20060128 10:15:16 nbsp Bringing up MLKJ is nonsequitur.  MLKJs work was with poor southern African Americans, not the educated and affluent.  His work stands on its own merit regardless of the conduct of others.  The reality is that only a handful of people know the whole Celeste Rose story and theyre not talking.  We dont know why she was fired.  I can guess that she thought she had a job for life and found an lawyer that agreed with her.  Larry made a command decision to pay her off probably because either a) she had a chance of winning big or b) the publicity of the case would be damaging to UC and/or UC leadership.  Sadly, I dont think theres any way for us to know. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20060129 20:23:16 nbsp I guess someone here doesnt know the meaning of facetious. And Im pretty sure MLK Jr. fought for minorities in general  there wouldnt be very many educated and affluent AAs if it werent for him and other civil rights leaders. Users/ApolloStumpy

20060203 06:20:50 nbsp In the SF Chron article, Roses attorney says the facts related to her claim of discrimination are compelling.  Why has no onethe Aggie, the Davis Enterprise, the Bee and the Chroniclebothered to test the claim by conducting an investigation into the Chancellors personnel practices?  The fifty members of the faculty who signed the petition to conduct a vote of no confidence should be among the first to start asking such questions, unless of course they have no interest in equal opportunity and diversity.  I suppose such a course of inquiry is too much to ask from the faculty of one of the worlds leading research universities?  One might start by asking what would one have to demonstrate to sustain a claim of discrimination?  Unless, of course, its easier to villify the person making the claim.... Users/VincentHarris

20060203 06:35:26 nbsp Either way, she sounds like a sellout Users/ApolloStumpy

20060203 09:58:11 nbsp Well of course her attorney claims the facts of her case is compelling, what a shock. And I certainly dont think the the lack of minority hires in the admin qualifies as evidence, at the most that simply proves the lack of affirmative action. But I totally agree that someone needs to investigate this, and the student paper or petitioning faculty certainly seems like a good place to start.  I agree that a quick settlement looks bad. If the SF Chron is right that perhaps the UCD Admin. just wants to avoid bad press, I would say it is already too late for that. Besides if there is no merit, they would be better off clearing their name. And p.s., lets face it, Davis is good, but it is not one of the worlds leading research universities.  Users/JackMehoff

20060203 12:52:48 nbsp Well, by a broad enough definition... Besides, Davis is a leader in some fields. Users/RoyWright

The leader  at the seat of power. Anyway, do we know if a move to terminate her contract would work? Surely there must be some provision against allocating UC money to bribes/extortionists? Users/JosephBleckman

20060203 19:44:32 nbsp You know, if she HADNT threatened a lawsuit but this arrangement was made it would be widely condemned as ridiculous graft/bribery/corruption.  Yet because she sued, its okay to give her half a million dollars to do nothing.  Why is it that her contentious action justifies her looting of the UC budget?  Really I think the person to be condemned here isnt Chancellor Vanderhoef, but Celeste Rose, who is currently pillaging our collective funds. Users/KrisFricke
  You are a white male,  therefore, you have no idea what it is like to fill a womans role in an increasingly racist and sexist system. Furthermore, you  will never understand the intense pain of sexism against an  African American woman in our patriarchal society. As a white man, you were brought into a world  which gives you inborn white privilege. Sadly, your ego is allowing you to broadcast your own ignorance over the world wide web. People who are the causes genocide and feminicide are either ignorant, apathetic or immoral. Are you?

  If you would like to discuss who is currently pillaging our collective funds, please look to the  revovling door of administration anf industry.

  Learn who the UC Regents are and where  student fees are really going.

  Research  white privilege  educate yourself , research UCD antisemitism and Howard Zochlinski.  Lastly, consider an apology for the slander against Ms. Rose.

  She has put up with racists and sexists for 55 years, Mr. Fricke.  Have you?

   Abednego Wood, if that is your real name (and its not) 
   (1) Many people would wonder why I would even bother to respond to such a clearly psychotic posting, so I shall address this question first of all.  While obviously I dont have to worry about anyone actually being swayed by your pitiful argument, it amuses me to point out the many reasons why what you say is completely inapplicable to the argument at hand.
   (2) Reread the comment of mine to which you responded.  Does whether or not one lady who already earns $180,000 a year receive half a million dollars to do nothing hinge upon an idea what it is like to fill a womans role in an increasingly racist and sexist system?  I would say it does not.  That is money which could, among other things, probably have otherwise been given over to a scholarship for persons of underrepresented minorities & genders.
   (3) Re: Sadly, your ego is allowing you to broadcast your own ignorance over the world wide web.  Please identify what in my original posting could be perceived as egotistic.
   (4) Re: People who are the causes genocide and feminicide are either ignorant, apathetic or immoral. Are you? (A) No. (B) When did genocide & feminicide join the discussion of whether or not Celeste Rose deserves half a million dollars?
   (5) Re: the revolving door of administration yes thats what I was implying Rose was a part of, when I foolishly overlooked the fact that her ethnicity/gender exonerates her from being part of the system.
   (6) As mentioned below, you clearly dont know the definition of slander.  I have written about the definition of slander in the paper as well as initiated defamation lawsuits, I know what th definition of slander is and it more closely resembles what youre trying to do to me than anything I have come close to. Users/KrisFricke


Yeah, Fricke! Whitey dont face discrimination or racism at all. Its all lollypops and roses for you white folk. You just dont understand! Users/JosephBleckman

20060302 04:14:50 nbsp So basically because miss Rose is a Black woman we cannot question her? Apparently now asking questions is racist. I believe this matter deserves some serious thought and attention from people on both sides of the issue. Obviously there is a lot of animosity here. Perhaps C. Rose should make a public statement concerning allegations as should L. Vanderhoef. Perhaps an article in the Aggie is in order? Users/TusharRawat

20060302 09:37:50 nbsp I think the Black Caucus involvement issue is just as fascinating.  Vanderhoef says they called with concern, they laughed/denied it off, but coincidently, Roses husband is an aide to a caucus member.   Users/EdWins ES

20060302 14:26:25 nbsp Celeste Rose is black?  Seriously, this somehow escaped me up to this point.  To me, Ive always looked at this as a debate between whether the University should be run as a corporation (as L. Vizzle paid off Rose to avoid further complications) or as a public body (where a public investigation would be necessary, and the guilty wouldnt be protected by the University).  Its really an issue between the faculty and the administration as to how the University should operate.  This is why, as a grad student and member of ASUCD, Ive been trying to avoid this issue and get other students to avoid it too.  I believe the issue is not so much about Rose herself as it is about how the University operates. Users/BrentLaabs
