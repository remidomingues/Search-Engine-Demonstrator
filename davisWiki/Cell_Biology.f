To understand living organisms, the biologist must understand the cell. Hence, cell biology lies a tthe core of the biological sciences. Students taking this major gain a solid foundation in biological principles. The major emphasizes how cellular organization and function contribute to the development, maintenance and reproduction of adult organisms. The major illustrates the ways in which principles derived from physical sciences, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology are integrated in the study of living cells and emphasizes the experimental nature of the study of cell biology.
