Cenarios Pizza is a regional chain pizza brand out of Vacaville or Fairfield.  They sell spaghetti by the bucket this could lead to a wild night if you could order enough buckets. Their menu shows that besides pizza they have pasta (spaghetti, fettuccini Alfredo, ravioli), wings, salads, bread, and of course soda. Prices seem quite reasonable.

The minimum for Delivery delivery is $10. Thats excluding delivery charge and tax. That said, the real minimum delivery is 12.88 ($10 + the $2 delivery charge + tax). They have a bit of pasta too, which they deliver as well, and their pasta meals start around $5.

They accept checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. For large/business orders, you can also have your order billed.

They also have locations at 364 Pittman Rd., Cordelia, 1955 W. Texas, Fairfield, 1490 Alamo Dr., Vacaville, and 1160 Pitt School Rd., Dixon.

Formerly, Ricos Pizza was in this Shopping Centers shopping center.


 Specials and Deals 

Cenarios runs several deals pretty much all the time, the key is to ask for the deal youre getting by name in order to get the discount. Check your junk mail for their coupons.

Double Dose: 2 large 2topping pizzas for 16.99
One on One: 1 large 1topping pizza and a Fred Bread (essentially garlic bread) for 10.99
Little Pep 2: 2 medium 1topping pizzas for 12.49
Lunch Special: Served all day, 1 1topping personal pizza, a Fred Bread OR a Salad, and a 12 oz drink for $4.99. This is pretty much the best deal in town.
XLarge 1 topping pizza for $6.99 Best current deal (MTh only)X (discontinued for now)


Overall, with Cenarios you get what you pay for. Its a small town business thats regularly short staffed, so anytime youre trying to get a pizza a) delivered and b) during a dinner rush, your product quality may drop a bit. Other than that, the pizza is solid, and the famed Fred Bread are rather tasty. Id recommend it to any one on a budget and willing to make the trip for a pickup.

You can get two 2topping pizzas for $15.99 with the Super Saver Card I picked up for free at Togos. To me, thats the best pizza deal in town.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

When you order ask for the Double Dose Deal 2 TwoTopping pizzas for $15.99. Also ask for the OneonOne deal 1large pepperoni pizza with an order of Fred Bread for 11.99.  HF



20050608 17:16:55 nbsp I was pretty disappointed with Cenarios. Their Double Dose Deal was decidedly diminuitive. Small pizzas, flavor nothing to write home about, and price not all that low. Pass on this noise, Jack! Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn

20050608 17:34:08 nbsp I disagree.  Their larges are the same size as most larges, and larger than many Davis pizzas.  And as far as pizza flavor goes, I have no fault with their sauce, crust or cheese, and Im sort of picky about those items.  I think toppings can make the biggest difference.  See, its hard to say whats wrong with a pizza unless youre a little more precise.  With every pizza, there are specific things that I like and dont like.  But if you look at the Pizza measurement comparison chart, you can definitely see how Cenarios compares to other Davis pizza sizes.  Since all their Pizzas at Cenarios are 2for1, you can get their superhuge pizza (18 which is very huge), or their square pizza (12x17!), and its still a good value at roughly $20.  I dunno, my verdict is that Cenarios is a good balance of quality and value, at least for Davis.Users/JaimeRaba

20050608 17:37:47 nbsp hahaha, I love how we can refer to the chart now.  Users/GeorgeLewis

20051015 20:50:34 nbsp I thought that Cenarios was excellent. It was very cheap, and the Fred Bread although the name is odd was delicious. My friends and I polished off two large pizzas. I highly recommend this place. Users/MaggieBlank

 the story of the Fred Bread can be found on their website...less oddsounding when you read the story )

20060222 18:36:36 nbsp I have a little secret... they give you the discount price without having a coupon. Most of their discount prices are actually just their regular, low prices. The pizza is actually really good considering how cheap it is. Users/ChrisMay

20060615 19:43:20 nbsp Cenarios sucks. We just ordered two medium pizzas  one cheese, one pepperoni  for pickup. We drove over to pick them up after the estimated 45 minutes(!), and they told us they were being delivered. They were finally delivered after about an hour and 10 minutes and a call from the driver who couldnt find his way from the front of Solano Park (where theres a freaking map) to our apartment, and they were both pepperoni. Not only that, but there is barely any cheese on either of them. What a ridiculous (and expensive) experience. Users/RoyWright

20060811 20:34:56 nbsp The owner at this place is shady. I used to work here and when I quit he said he lost my last two paychecks and never gave me new ones. Thats like $200+!!!!! Users/ChrisMay

20060927 12:29:10 nbsp This place is rather nifty. Always good, staff is friendly, unlike other places in town Ive been to. Users/ChrisThompson

20070329 20:05:36 nbsp I have always been greeted with a charming staff.  They will make vegan/cheesefree pizzas if you ask; and they generally are more than happy to accomodate your order.  It is true, the delivery guys have made mistakes, but if you call it in they will try to fix it!  I had bacon on my vegan pizza once and they sent a delivery guy to exchange it so I didnt have to go and get it.  Strongly, strongly reccomend cheeseless with fresh tomato, pineapple, and artichoke!!!!   Users/SoizicBovard

20070916 12:59:53 nbsp Decent pizza for the price.  You get what you pay for.  If you want great pizza, try Steves or Woodstocks.  The choice is yours.  Pony up an extra five for fresh toppings, hot pizza, and great service at Steves or Woodstocks, or save a few at Cenarios. Users/Casey

20071016 20:02:07 nbsp Do NOT order online from Cenarios.

I have always liked their pizza, but when I ordered online they said my pizza would arrive within 45 minutes. It has been over an hour, and the pizza still hasnt arrived. When I called the place, the guy said that I called during their rush service (its now 8pm), and that it usually takes 1 hour and 45min. I told him that the website said 45 min, and he said, yeah, it always says that. I said that maybe they should take that off then, because I felt misled, and he said he could do nothing about the website, and that the website deals are totally different from the ones at the store. He said people should call after placing their orders online anyway, just to check in. I said I would never order online again. Users/RG

20071030 15:17:24 nbsp Do NOT order online from them and, more importantly, do NOT order from them. I ordered online and it never came, even though I received an email confirmation and anything. Prior to this, I had their pizza before (when I actually received the pizza) and it was bland, lacked flavor, and had hardly any toppings. Your best choice is just to order somewhere else. You will not impress anyone by having Cenarios delivered.  Users/JustinBaker

20071219 19:52:54 nbsp By far, THE WORST PIZZA IN TOWN!!! STAY FAR AWAY!!! Users/thelonepiper555

20080315 16:55:28 nbsp Tried this for the first time today.  Someone ordered it for lunch.  It was okay. For some reason they ordered a cheese pizza which, uh, why bother?  I know, I know some of you love cheese only, but I like my toppings!  Its all about the toppings for me.  At any rate, the pizza was okay.  Not bad for a cheese only pizzain my book.  I wasnt crazy about the tomato sauce, but thats something Im particular about so. . .its worth trying out.  At some point I plan on going back and ordering a combo or something. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080317 13:21:59 nbsp Ive had no trouble ordering from them online and I think their pizza is (usually) pretty good. The problem is that theyre not consistent. Ive had really great service where theyve delivered really quick & the food was great and then times when its taken them about 2 hours and the food seemed undercooked. But, theyre pretty cheap!  Users/JM

20080402 14:26:42 nbsp its actually 12.49 for a large when you deliver Users/Rawgerio

20080531 14:21:17 nbsp Good pizza and good deals.   BAD, BAD, did I say BAD service, attitude, etc. Users/Denise

20080705 19:36:20 nbsp This is the worst pizza chain in Davis.  its crap.  We get it at the law school all the time, and I cringe.  Avoid it at all costs.   Users/JimBob

20080804 19:48:38 nbsp I just got off of the phone with cenarios pizza, and the phone service was horrible!! He was extremely rude, and kept putting me on hold (3 xs for 5 min intervals)and kept cutting me off. a phone order should take at the max 5 min.  Any way this better be the best pizza Ive ever eaten to get me out of the mood the rude phone person got me in. Users/onlyleo

20081129 04:37:01 nbsp I think the pizza was ok, but my biggest complaint is that it was too dry. Where was the sauce?!?!?  Users/DCWine

20090426 10:12:33 nbsp  HORRIBLE PIZZA! The toppings were burnt, they gave me the wrong order and it took twice as long to deliver as they claimed. By the time it arrived the pizza wasnt even warm. Plus as said many times before where is the sauce? Just plain REALLY BAD PIZZA. Not to mention one of the rudest people I have ever spoken to over the phone. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HORRIBLE PIZZA TO ANYONE! The $1 pizza from WalMart is better quality pizza. Users/Dozer

20090815 23:47:29 nbsp This is probably the best deal in town for a pizza. Great pizza, fast delivery, even better if you go and get it yourself. Its a small establishment on Covell Blvd near the Nugget Market. If I had had a choice and not much cash, I would always order from Cenarios.  Users/Darren22

20100507 13:53:22 nbsp I had to order from here for work lunches, and Im pretty much done with them.  The pizza was fine.  Its the delivery.  I have had several instances of them being over an hour late.  They always blame the fact that they have school lunches to deliver. They need to run their business better.  If I were able to pick up the pizzas, I would use this place.  I really dont have time in my schedule to wait an hour for them to deliver my pizzas. Users/striker

20100512 20:14:43 nbsp Cant go wrong with the square shooter, pretty cheap too Users/StevenDaubert

20100924 20:42:25 nbsp Cenarios is great pizza and a good value for the money.  Always ask about their specialsI dont like meat on pizza and the specials are rarely vegie, but theyre a great deal.  The crust is excellent, portions are generous and its very tasty pizza.  Im a convert from Round Tablevery good but outrageously expensive.  Delivery is excellent.  I hope their business doesnt get hurt from that AWFUL Little Ceasars right next doorgo figure!? Users/toriac

20101208 17:32:53 nbsp Dear Cenarios Pizza,

Embedding music on a webpage is super old school, and it was obnoxious back then too. Im petty enough to not order from you just because of that.

Sincerely,  Users/KatherineChiu

20110126 18:11:50 nbsp SORRY YOU SO UPTIGHT KAT, BUT THESE PIEZ ARE DOPE! Users/MrWest

20110514 17:22:23 nbsp i love getting their 5.99 pepperoni pizza. Its really good. Its definately worth paying an extra dollar for this pizza instead of the pizza at little caesars. Users/rachealgalante

20110524 15:23:35 nbsp Just had their $4.99 lunch special.
Beats their Little Carsars competitors a stone throw away any day.
I had a mini cheese pizza, Fred bread and a water for all $5.90(?)

Real good. Users/NikhilDahal

Teehee, Fred Bread. Users/JesseTurner
