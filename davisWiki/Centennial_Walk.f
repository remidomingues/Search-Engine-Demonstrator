Centennial Walk is a 12ft. wide, 450ft. long walkway at the center of the quad. Running northsouth, it connects the MU Patio with Shields Avenue. The walkway was unveiled on Oct. 15, 2008 as part of the UC Davis Centennial commemorating the 190809 term when students first lived on campus.

The walkway between the north and south ends of the quad used to be a traditional 6ft. wide sidewalk, making the new walk twice as wide as the old. Onefootwide granite paving stones will be added to the edges. The project will also bring back a circle feature at the Quads center, in the middle of the walkway.

The university is paying $350,000 to renovate the walkway. Construction began in July 2008.
