Center Mass Shooting Range replaced The Shooting Gallery, Inc. sometime in 2010.  It is a somewhat local shooting range with a store and rental guns firearms.  Basic range fees are $9/hour (is this still current?).  Yearly membership fees are available in the $150350 range, including access to a private 25yard range for $4.00 per hour, free shooting for guests, and discounts on rentals and merchandise.  They will do local Federal Firearms License transfers.

20101218 23:32:54 nbsp Went there to try out a .45 Glock and the place was packed so there was a bit of a wait. They were nice enough to give me free use of the range and a free rental because of the wait so I just had to pay for the ammo and targets, which is really nice when youre shooting a .45.
