The Center for Child and Family Studies (CCFS) is run by the Human Development Department of Human and Community Development, and serves as a laboratory for the development of experimental educational programs for children and families. It also serves as an observation laboratory for UC Davis Undergraduate Students undergraduates and graduate students to complement coursework in child and human development, as well as a research facility for UC Davis faculty and graduate students. The experimental programs and research of the laboratory are intended to advance the field of child development.

The CCFS http://ccfs.ucdavis.edu/EarlyChildhoodLaboratory.html Early Childhood Lab offers an Infant and Toddler program (ages 616 months and 1624 months) and a Schools preschool program (ages 24 and 35). Care and instruction is provided by a head teacher, and student interns taking HDE 140/140L (changes on a quarterly basis).

There is a waiting list for all programs. Decisions on enrollment are based on the need to enroll children who will best help the program attain or maintain the diversity desired, and the UCD student/nonstudent (parents) ratio required.
