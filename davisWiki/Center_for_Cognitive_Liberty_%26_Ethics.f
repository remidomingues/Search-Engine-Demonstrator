The Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics, aka the CCLE, is a NonProfit Organizations nonprofit organization that works solely to advance sustainable social policies that protect freedom of thought. CCLE was founded to promote public awareness and legal recognition of cognitive liberty and the right of each individual to think independently, to have decisionmaking authority over matters affecting his or her mind, and to engage in the full spectrum of possible thought.  CCLE bases its policies on the guiding values of privacy, autonomy and choice.
