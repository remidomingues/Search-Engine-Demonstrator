As a constituent part of the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, the Center for Wine Economics will provide research assisting Californias winemakers in maximizing their market share in both domestic and international wine markets.

More information to come soon. The center does not have its own website up yet, but interested onlookers can browse its http://robertmondaviinstitute.ucdavis.edu/centers/wineeconomics temporary website on the RMI website.
