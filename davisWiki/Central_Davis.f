Central Davis is an area of Davis fascinatingly named as such due to the likelihood of finding it in the middle of any given map of Davis.

The area commonly referred to as Central Davis by Davis citizens is bound on the north by West Covell, on the west side by Highway 113, on the south side by Russell Boulevard, and on the east side by the railroad tracks.

Central Davis contains a number of valued Davis businesses, delightful parks, schools, and pleasantlooking residences. There are also a bunch of Fraternity fraternities on Russell.

Numerous delightful cottagestyle houses line the streets of Central Davis.  It is remarkable the degree to which the sweet houses, tall trees, and broad streets camouflage unsightly apartment complexes.
