Its a library! In a box! Opened in July 2012, the Central Davis Library in a Box is exactly that: An allweather wooden box with a rotating inventory of books donated and borrowed by community members and anyone who happens to be passing by. The collection is varied and changes on a daily basis depending on who returns or donates what and when. Selections include popular fiction, guidebooks and howtos, childrens books, coffee table books, graphic novels, classics, whodunnits, science fiction, fantasy, etc.  Though there is an emphasis on childrens and young adult books, all genres are welcome and pretty much every reader can find something of interest. Anyone looking for their next book to read or with extra books they want to donate is welcome to come on by and check it out.  Theres also a magazine section on top below the peaked roof. The instructions read: Borrow. Read. Return. Donate. Repeat.  And thats really all there is to it.

The Central Davis Library in a Box is the second Little Free Library in Davis.  The original branch is the East Davis Library in a Box, located on 8th St, east of Pole Line and across the street from the cemetery.
