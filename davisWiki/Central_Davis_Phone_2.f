Central Davis Phone #2 on the Central Davis Phones node

Phone Number: (530) 7569704

Location: The phone is on Anderson Rd., outside of the Medical center.  Its also across the street from the Pirate Ship (616 Anderson Rd.).

Description: The phone itself seems somewhat out of place in its container  a common problem for payphones in our town.  The phone booth is faded, but the fade complements the yellow phone well.  You might have good luck catching drunks on this phone if you call it during regular party hours, due to its location at the start of Anderson Rd..

Charge: 50cent for local.
