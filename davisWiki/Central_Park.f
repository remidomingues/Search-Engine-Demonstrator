Central Park is located Downtown between B and C Streets, and is bounded by 3rd and 5th Streets on the south and north, respectively.  It has an adjacent parking lot. The southwest corner is home to the US Bicycling Hall of Fame. The northeast corner houses the Hattie Weber Museum and the public restroom facility known as the WPA Building. The Central Park is also home to an old Lincoln Highway marker.

The park is home to a humanpowered The Flying Carousel of the Delta Breeze carousel, which was added on September 7^th^ 1995. One person pedals the thing and others ride.


The park was originally known as Davis City Park. It was created in 1937, with roughly twothirds of the expenses being covered by the WPA. The city paid for the rest.

The park was expanded in 1986 after the successful passage of June_1986_Election/Measure_S Measure S. Prior to this, the southern half of the park actually used to be an empty lot for years (it was formerly the site of Davis first elementary school). During those days, in the early years of the Whole Earth Festival, actual hippies used to park their VW campers there over the WEF weekend. It was also the starting point for the DHS Homecoming parade for many years.  The empty lot was known for years as The ArdenMayfair lot because at one time there was going to be an ArdenMayfair built on it. It took building Third & B and the Farmers Market to finally get people out of the habit of referring to it as the Arden Mayfair lot!  Now the most common nickname for the park is the Farmers Market, as theres a large shelter there for the market to take place under.

WiFi was added to the park in April of 2006 (Instaconnect). To use the service, one must fill out an electronic form to get a username. 24hour guest access is free while feebased packages are offered to more regular users.

Beginning in the spring of 2006, volunteers have begun a renovation of the Central Park Gardens gardens in Central Park.  This renovation has transformed the space into beautiful flower gardens, demonstration gardens, gardens showcasing sustainable horticultural practices, and a place for childrens activities and familyoriented programs.  To find out more information, volunteer, or donate, visit the http://www.centralparkgardens.org Central Park Gardens website.

In December 2011, Davis Voice published a http://www.davisvoice.com/2011/12/futurerenovationsofcentralpark/ summary of upcoming renovations.

20051120 00:14:59 nbsp Does anyone know about the majestic Old Oak Tree surrounded by the deck structure at C & 4th Streets?  Was it purposefully planted? or did it simply volunteer its presence, perhaps to the creation of the Park?   Any estimates on how old it is?  When was the surrounding deck built?  That Old Oak Tree has great Chi (Qi)! Users/DanielQuincy
  Dont know much about Oak tree ages, except to say that it is likely over 100 yrs old, and so would predate the park.  Users/rocksanddirt

20110804 15:49:53 nbsp Central Park used to be just the 5th to 4th, B to C portion... a one block park (as indicated by the plaque above).  Used to be the other part was just gravel... its where the Boy Scouts used to sell Christmas trees, various cheesy carnivals would come through (similar to what you might find in a miniaturized county fair), and home to various flea markets and such.  It was nice when they expanded, made it so kids could run around comfortably, and Farmers Market had a comfortable home.  The tree was one of the few green spots across 4th street, if memory serves.
