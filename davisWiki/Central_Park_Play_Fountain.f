The Water Fountains fountain at Central Park, which is no longer operating, was a fantastic way to cool off on a hot day.  Kids loved to run through the fountain, especially during the Picnic In The Park events in the warm weather. Many parents let their small children run naked through this fountainmaybe they hadnt planned a fountain related stop.  Adults have also been known to use the fountain to cool off on a hot day and indulge their inner child.

The fountain will no longer be used, apparently due to hygienic concerns.

The idea to put a fountain in the park was proposed during the parks planning stages in 1937. Originally, the city had considered a wading pool, but changed its mind, due in part to concern over expenses.
