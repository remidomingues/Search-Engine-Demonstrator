In Davis most phone lines to customers, known as wiki:WikiPedia:Local_loop local loops, go through this AT&T building on the corner of Third Street Third and C Street C Streets. In front is a landmark Phone Building Elm Tree Elm Tree. Even though it has the new AT&T logo, it still has red, yellow, and brown tiles that matched the old wiki:WikiPedia:Pacific Bell red star logo.

In the traditional structure of telephone networks in the United States, as developed by AT&T and its subsidiaries, all phone cables in a small town will go to one building, called the Central Office. Internationally, these buildings are generically known as exchanges, but exchange has a more specific meaning in this context (phone systems in the USA), and many exchanges will often be in one central office. If not for the development of remote terminals, essentially very small selfcontained central offices, Davis would probably have several central office buildings with its current population.
