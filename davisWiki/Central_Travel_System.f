Departments at UC Davis can charge airfare and other travel expenses to the campus Central Travel System, referred to as CTS.  Administered by US Bank and UC Davis Accounting & Financial Services, this allows departments to handle business travel expenses without using a Visa card or other billing system.  A handful of travel agencies can bill directly to the CTS account.
