The ultimate test of Alcohol tolerance.


Century Club is pretty straightforward: 100 shots of beer, 100 minutes. Similar in concept to Power Hour, Century Club is simply the next step, a Drinking games drinking game for the truly hardcore. Be warned, that it gets very hard to keep track of time, or how many shots one has completed, therefore an alarm every minute, or CD mix (100 songs, 1 minute each) or DVD mix (100 music videos, 1 minute each) is a recommended alternative rather than to simply watching the clock.

In case youre wondering what the challenge is, just consider the quantity of beer involved.  A standard single size wiki:wikipedia:shot glass in the U.S. holds 1.5 ounces.  So, thats 150 ounces of beer in about an hour and a half.  One gallon contains 128 ounces.  So imagine filling a gallonsize milk jug with beer, drinking all of that, and then tossing back another 22 ounces on top of it.

The more obvious comparison is drinking a normal 12pack of beer, and then another half bottle, in a little over an hour and a half. Think that sounds easy?  Then People you may be a good candidate for the Century Club.

20050707 16:51:24 nbsp I played this game at a campsite in Munich, Germany with vending machine beer that only cost a euro.  Unfortunately, I wimped out somewhere in the 50s. Users/MiriamKaufman

20051214 04:52:33 nbsp Three of my friends attempted this today in the middle of finals week. One completed it, promptly puked in a trashbag, then ran around the apartment complex with his bag of puke bragging about his feat. One of the other ones puked in the middle of it, and when another friend laughed at him about it, he hit the friend with the bag. They both burst out laughing. I personally would fail miserably in this challenge, but its still one of the funniest things to take part in. Users/GiladGurantz

20090506 22:49:39 nbsp Ive participated in this a few times,  made it to around 80 each time.  Be sure to have some trash bags handy,  its definitely not for the weak. Fun challenge though if you feel like testing your alcohol limits. Users/ChrisOchoa
