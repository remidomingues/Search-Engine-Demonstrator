Cernio provides Computer and Internet internet solutions to professionals.  Thanks in large part to the excellent example of the Davis Food Coop and inspiration drawn from Kim Stanley Robinsons wiki:WikiPedia:Mars_trilogy Mars Trilogy, Cernio is in the process of becoming a forprofit multistakeholder http://www.cernio.com/cooperative/ cooperative based in British Columbia, Canada.   While Cernio hasnt had a physical presence in Davis for quite some time now, its Davis roots are strong.

The Davis/Sacramento members and potential members meet occasionally at Mishkas or Delta of Venus to talk about our projects, technology in general, politics, etc.  There are weekly virtual meetings to accommodate all members, including folks in Hawaii, Florida, Europe, Canada, etc.  Please mailto:inquire@cernio.com inquire if youd like to participate.

Davis Wiki currently uses Cernio for its wiki:wikispot:System Info colocation needs.


I am interested to know what happens in Davis, since the DC seems to be in Santa Rosa (or therebouts)? Is it just a satelleite admin office or something? Users/DomenicSantangelo
  20051202 13:32:42 nbsp The following activities have been known to occur at the Davis office: talking on the phone, email communications, book reading, web browsing and design, holding meetings, writing and reading documents, accepting and refusing clients, hiring and firing consultants, AR and AP work, configuring and testing servers, systems administration, more systems administration, sleeping in between long workdays, and procrastination.  What does your employer do at its Davis office? Users/GrahamFreeman
