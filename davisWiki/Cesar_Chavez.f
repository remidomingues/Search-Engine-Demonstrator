Cesar Chavez (19271993) was a worldrenowned civil rights leader. He is best known for his efforts in campaigning for the fair treatment of farm laborers and ethical agricultural practices in general. In the Davis Timeline/1970 1970s, he spoke at Davis Central Park rallies in support of tomato growers strikes. One such gathering in 1974 drew as many as 2000 people.

An annual Cesar Chavez Celebration has taken place in Davis Central Park since 2001. It is usually scheduled to occur on the closest Saturday to his birthday of March 31st, so as to coincide with the weekend Farmers Market.

Cesar Chavez Elementary School and Cesar Chavez Plaza are named after the activist.
