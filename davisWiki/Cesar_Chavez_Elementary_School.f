20110805 15:54:01 nbsp Went to school here from K to 3rd grade (79  82?).  Great memories, particularly from The Bee Hive (for the W.D.E. Busy Bees), a play structure on the North side of the school, where the existing play structure is today.  Of course, instead of the safe, molded plastic with forgiving cushioning on the ground, the Bee Hive was a triangular, sort of Ski Villa shaped 2 story wooden behemoth, with a pole and slide to come down.  It of course would give you splinters just by looking at the thing... that aside, us kids thought it was just awesome.  Even on the brightest days it was very dark inside, so multiple spiders loved living in (and underneath) the structure.  Kids also would periodically fall (or jump) off the top story and land into the (largely unforgiving) wood chips below.  The thing would be such a liability these days, its crazy... but itll be remembered by any/all of us who spent our entire recess most days playing tag in and around the Bee Hive. Users/OldDavis73
