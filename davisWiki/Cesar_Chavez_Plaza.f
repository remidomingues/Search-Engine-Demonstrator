If you know people who work in downtown Davis and are low income we have created the first affordable one bedroom apartments in Downtown Davis. Rents at CCP will range from $223$620 (2008 rents will be a little higher).

A one bedroom unit in Davis rented at an average of $867 in Davis for 200607. Rents for one bedroom apartments went up $27 dollars per month (3.21%) last year. According to the annual UCD Housing Study there are 2,575 one bedroom apartments in Davis and only 18 were vacant at the time of the study. A vacancy rate of 0.7% is the lowest vacancy rate of any size unit in Davis. There are 52 one bedroom apartments available at CCP. Olive Drive is particularly valuable for people of all ages who do not have their own transportation and work in the downtown.

There are four key points to make with Cesar Chavez Plaza.

 1. Most people who work downtown are low income. As there are no subsidized apartments downtown people have little ability to reduce their housing     cost. Many people double up in rooms or share houses. CCP is a chance to have your own one bedroom apartment at a reasonable cost.
 1. 26 of the 52 apartments are visitable, accessible and built adaptable for the disabled. The apartments have features that make them the most disability friendly apartments in Davis.
 1. 19 of the apartments are specifically set aside for people with physical or mental disabilities and who are at risk of homelessness. There is a full time social services coordinator to assist residents with qualifying disabilities. There is a Community Building with a dining room and kitchen, offices, foyer and a Laundromat. There are wonderful outdoor spaces and community gardens. There is also a full time manager also on site.
 1. CCP is within walking distance of the downtown with many buses each hour to UCD and the rest of Davis. Residents of CCP can easily walk or bike to work, shopping, services, dining and entertainment. It will be a great location for living easily without a car.
