Chabad of Davis is a Judaism Jewish community center/synagogue that accepts Jews of all beliefs. The Rabbi here is Rabbi Shmaryahu Brownstein.

If youre Jewish, and youre not sure what a Chabad House is then you should come for some Shabbat, because words cant describe a Chabad house.

Dont be intimidated if youre not particularly observant, as they are very accepting of all.  Every time that this writer has gone to services or to the Rabbis house for dinner, she has seen at least one person in clothing that isnt particularly Orthodox (ie jeans).  You will not be judged, rather you will be welcomed...were happy to have more Jews attending (and eating the delicious food that Sorole, the Rabbis wife who just so happens to be from Italy, cooks).

Chabad is Hebrew: &#1495;&#1489;&#1524;&#1491;., and for those who cant read Hebrew, it is pronounced xAbAd (transcribed according to the wiki:WikiPedia:XSAMPA XSAMPA system).  The Ch should be pronounced like the ch in Bach, but Americans tend to pronounce that wrong too, as that sound doesnt exist in the English language.


They have a program called Taanya and Pizza on Thursday at noon at the tables in front of the quad.
