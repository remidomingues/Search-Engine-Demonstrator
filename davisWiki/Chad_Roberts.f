Fall 2007 Candidate Statement
My name is Chad Roberts and I am a fourthyear political science major running for ASUCD Senate with L.E.A.D.  Currently, I’m an intern for the Conservation Strategy Group, an environmental consulting and lobbying firm, as well as an intern for United States Congressmen George Miller.  On campus, I’m the executive vicepresident of the IFC Interfraternity Council, President of the Order of Omega honor society, vicechair of the City/ UCD Student Liaison Commission, a  member of the ASUCD StudentPolice Relations Committee,  a member of the Athletic Administrative Advisory Committee, a life guard at the Rec Pool, and the philanthropy chair for Delta Sigma Phi. If elected to Senate, the following is a partial list of the things I will accomplish:

First, I am going to increase and improve the current Tipsy Taxi service through the implementation of a voucher system.  This system will allow Unitrans dispatchers to send either Tipsy Taxi or a local cab company to pick up students, depending on who is available at that particular time. Either way, ASUCD will pick up the bill.

Second, I am going to increase the resources that club sport teams have to draw upon. I will support them by fighting for priority registration, increased funding, and resources to pursue large sponsorships. This will allow these teams to continue competing at high levels and also help grow UC Davis image around the country.

And finally, I will work to improve campus sustainability by replacing fluorescent and incandescent lights around campus with Compact Fluorescent Lights.  This will not only help to alleviate the University’s utility deficit as these lights use 75% less energy and last ten times longer, but also demonstrate our commitment to leading the way towards a more sustainable future.

Vote for CHAD ROBERTS and the L.E.A.D. Slate for ASUCD Senate!
