Someone placed a Chalkboard in front of the J Street Coop at the intersection of 3rd Street and J Street and encouraged people to share. Someone else (the City?) took it away.


YIPPIE! new addition in lieu of chalkboard and new senseless act of beauty by a beautiful j street border who before moving to cali was in THAILAND where if you visit you will see small shrines that look like doll houses on pillars outside most buildings called SPIRIT HOUSES they often contain little figures such as elephants for good fortune. Now J street has its own spirit house painted by several of the residents. Check it out and feel free to add offerings such as insense, fruit, red soda, figurines, etc...
