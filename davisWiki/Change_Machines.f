Sometimes you just need change.  Be it for Laundry laundry, to make a purchase from a Vending Machines vending machine or to prep for a game of Drinking Games quarters.  Here are a few places in Davis to acquire coin tender.

Around Town

   Auto Washette dispenses quarters
   Davis Branch Library  dispenses dimes and nickels
   Quick Clean Center  dispenses quarters, sign says for customers only
   Round Table Pizza  dispenses quarters
   Wash Mill  dispenses quarters, sign says for customers only

On Campus

   MUGA  between the token machines (only accepts $1 and $5)
   Meyer Hall  second floor, behind the elevators. (Is frequently empty or out of order.)

Departed:
   Soap City Laundromat  dispenses quarters

There used to be one next to the elevator on the lowest level of the North Entry Parking Structure, but was out of order for awhile, and TAPS said it would be indefinitely out of order in 200702.  It was removed later that year. The Shields Library machine has also been removed as of August 2008.


20070207 00:15:13 nbsp Im pretty sure the MUGA change machine only accepts $1 bills. At least, as of 1/2007. I recommend just going to a bank and exchanging larger bills. Users/LeonardMarque

20080416 16:55:24 nbsp Ive had $5 go through at the MUGA and Shields change machines as of spring 07. Users/JenniferRutherford

20090724 13:11:55 nbsp I went to Meyer Hall today. However, I did not find any change machines behind the elevators at the 2nd floor(I checked the elevators in both buildings of Meyer). Has the change machine being removed?  Users/warmsmile
