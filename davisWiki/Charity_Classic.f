 THE WHY 

The purpose of our program is to encourage the student population of UC Davis to look beyond themselves by learning what it means to sacrifice of their own resources to benefit the global community at large. Our goal is for the student population of UCD to gain a better understanding of service, compassion, and selflessness by giving them the opportunity to give a little of themselves to meet an urgent need facing countless people around the world.

In the world in which we live today, nearly 1 billion people live without access to clean water  a terrible reality which contributes to death, disease, and poverty all over the globe. In response to this need, The 1000 Wells organization is a group that drills wells for impoverished communities in Africa, bringing hope and abundant life to people lacking this essential resource. It is this organization that we have decided to partner with this year through our philanthropy event, The 2nd Annual Charity Classic. This event consists of a flag football tournament, in which we hope to increase the awareness within the student body of great needs of people all over the world while having a great time in healthy competition and great fun. It is being put on by Alpha Gamma Omega, a ChristCentered Fraternity, and Alpha Delta Chi, a Christian sorority. In regards to the tournament, each team will pay a registration fee of $40, all of which will go directly to the 1000 Wells Project Davis 1000 Wells Project. The tournament will take place all day on April 30th 2006, and our desire is to raise enough money to build one well. How amazing it would be, how fulfilling and enriching to be able to see, touch, and experience what can happen when a body of people decides to look beyond their own needs and begins to care for the needs of others.

20060406 01:34:43 nbsp A water shortage in Africa? What about in California? Water shortages in Africa are just as much a result of poor civil planning in Africa as ours are here. In 1 Timothy 5:8, King James Version, it says But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. That stadium picture doesnt look like anywhere in Davis either. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060408 00:12:28 nbsp Does water come out of your tap when you turn it on?  Until the time that you have to walk 90 miles for water, only to let your camel drink first,  I believe that we should first consider those who are truly threatened by water shortages and famines.  What happens when we have a water shortage in California, the price goes up what, a dollar or two?  In africa people die.  Not by the tens or hundreds, but by the thousands.  For one as blessed as yourself to even compare the problems is very disheartening.  And its a flag football tournament, thats a football field in the picture... Users/LeviRyan
 That is so patronizing and condescending. Do you think all Africans have camels? What is the farthest you have ever walked? Maybe, just maybe, most of them drive cars, ride bicycles, or take buses and trains like people in California. They dont need your pity. There are places in California where, if people choose to live there, they would have to walk much farther than 90 miles for water. People living in similar places in Africa also make that choice, or more likely just dont live there, like in California. Most cities anywhere in the world are built around existing sources of water like rivers, lakes, or oceans, and if they are contaminated or dry that is again a result of poor civil planning and overpopulation. Again, California has these issues too. Have you ever heard of Owens Lake or Mono Lake? Owens Lake doesnt exist anymore because Los Angeles drank it all and now they are starting in on Mono Lake and the entire Colorado River if the rest of the watershed will let them. I dont blame them either, I just blame the planners that oversold the land then had to bring in water from outside. As for the picture, it is not only a football field, but a large stadium, and so completely irrelevant to this event besides not being in Davis which already would make it irrelevant.

20060408 01:22:23 nbsp $40 or even 1000 wells isnt going to do very much good in Africa. What happens if a city grows too large and the whole water table dries up? A much better plan helping prevent that problem would be to invest that $40 in a business and grow the business until you are rich. Then donate money to universities for the establishment and improvement of civil planning departments, and not just in Africa, these problems exist in every part of the world. Users/NickSchmalenberger
   20060408 11:05:04 nbsp Are you kidding? Users/RyanPrendiville
     No. Are you? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060420 13:24:06 nbsp Check this out: http://www.ug.edu.gh/deptdetails.php?recordID27 , the University of Ghana has a Department of Geography Resource and Development. Here: http://www.udsm.ac.tz/department_s/index.html , the University of Dar es Salaam has a Department of Urban and Rural Planning, a Department of Geography, a Department of Land Managment and Valuation, a Department of Environmental Engineering, and other departments that would be relevant to improvement of civil planning in Africa. Now tell me Africa doesnt know what civil planning is. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060420 16:38:20 nbsp The 1000 Well Project does not take Civil Planning power away from the people of Africa.  It provides the capital necessary to implement the infrastructure supported by local governments.  Knowing where, how, and why to build a well is very different than being financially able to build that well.  The organizations funded by Blood: Water Mission act in partnership with the community.  BWM does what the local people think is best, forcing some other idea on them would be wrong.  Currently, local and national governments want wells.  Thats what BWM is going to give them. Users/JillWeinstein
  More water resource infrastructure is what Los Angeles built and look what happened. Civil planning doesnt just mean knowing how to extract resources, but also how to conserve them and what kind of population an environment can sustainably support. More wells dont make more water. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 The difference between NO water and SOME water is huge. Many of these communities are filled with refugees that have been forced onto marginalized lands with inadequate resources.  They have no choice when it comes to where they are living, and in matters of life and death I see no reason why we should allow innocent people to die.  The Los Angeles water system created by Mulholland was motivated by greed and a complete diregard for the Owens Valley, you have that correct.  However, Los Angeles grew as a result of the water projects, not the other way around.  In Africa you have population growth(partly b/c of individuals escaping genocide) in dessicated areas with water miles and miles away.  Also, in LA the water projects were primarily used to promote agriculture, a luxury.  BWM targets communities that lack DRINKING water, a BASIC NEED.  Im sorry, but if you think that completely sustainable water supplies are possible in communities that dont even have water to begin with, youre dreaming.  BWM does all that it can to promote ecological awareness and sustainability, but areas that lack basic infrastructure arent capable of maintaining sophisticated and costly systems that arent even considered costeffective in the first world. Users/JillWeinstein
  Im just saying building wells will only create worse problems later. The fact that there is a shortage now means that there are already too many people there. Building wells will encourage people to live there permanently, have families, and then there will be even more demand for water. As you say, these people are living on marginalized lands with inadequate resources and this is because the whole world is overpopulated. If nothing is done about that, people will eventually realize how expensive it is to have children, have fewer of them, and the problem will solve itself. But meanwhile, it will be expensive to have children, in the form of famines, wars, genocides, and pandemics. The only things that can be done to reduce the population faster without hurting people (as with genocide) will still take a long time to implement, so I think that some suffering is inevitable. It is really the same as any other economic shortage, except much worse. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  In response to Jill, with LA, it is a cycle, of LA needs water, LA gets more water, LA grows even larger, and then LA needs more water. While in the past the LA water projects may have been primarily for agriculture, but since that initial period, LAs desire for water has been driven by the aforementioned cycle, not by farmers. As a response to Nick, I understand your economic argument. I do agree with your assertion that if we increase water production, water demand will also increase in the form of increased population. However, with increased water production there will be increased agricultural production, which will be increased economic activity for the region. Additionally, at this time the affected populations and their governments are not capable of thinking in the long term that you suggest, because they are still attempting to cope on a day to day basis. In this manner, the increased economic activity and giving the populace less to worry about in the short term will allow them to try to address the long term problem. Let me reiterate that I agree with your ideas and logic to some extent economically, but I feel that this as a stopgap measure will allow the government to focus on the larger issues you brought up. This is why the world needs economists. Users/MaxMikalonis
   There will not be increased water production, only increased water use. Relative to the watershed, wells use water, even though they produce it relative to the well users. Even if some sort of facility for chemical synthesis or purification of otherwise undrinkable water were built, such as a desalination plant, it would require energy. wiki:WikiPedia:TANSTAAFL There is no such thing as a free lunch. As I said above, more wells dont make more water. Users/NickSchmalenberger
