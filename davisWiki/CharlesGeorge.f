I guess Im new to this whole Wiki thing, but I love the concept.  Ive used the wiki for lots of info around davis, and just started editing and contributing.  Im a prodigal son of davis, having been raised here, then leaving for upstate NY for http://www.union.edu Union College.  Now that College is over Im programming for http://www.VIN.com VIN, a Locally Owned Websites locally owned website.  In the meantime, I need to get back in shape before Ultimate Frisbee Ultimate starts up in sac and davis again, (if any wikeans have better ultimate Info Id love to hear it).  Im also a big online gamer through the xbox hit me up at electricpirate if you want a game of Halo 2, DOA4, Fight night, Perferct Dark Zero, Or Ghost Recon: AW.  In general I can be reached at MailTo(chargeorge AT gmail DOT com)
