Charles has been a longtime fan of the Davis city and its Welcome to the wiki wiki (though is new to the latter).  He made his way through the Davis Joint Unified School District Davis school system, happily attended UC Davis UCD, and is now in a masters program at California State University, Sacramento CSUS.  He works in Sacramento at the California Energy Commission, and resides in Central Davis what used to be West Davis.

He promises to improve this page as he becomes more familiar with editing, and loves all variety of feedback.

He is a member of The Coalition (along with users/PaulDeleon him), and plays rhythm guitar.  He frequently is seen with some of the more users/RichardMarquez unsavory elements of town.
