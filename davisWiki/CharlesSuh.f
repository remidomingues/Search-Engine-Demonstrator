20060605 00:58:52 nbsp Im just curious as to why you created the 24 redirect. Nothing is linking to it and the page you redirected to shows up in the search results for 24 anyway. Users/WilliamLewis

20061013 13:02:07 nbsp If you think the page is named illogically, try renaming it.  Simply:  Sleeping on Campus shows up in searches for sleeping.  Wireless could refer to a lot of things besides internet  Id say it should redirect to Radio Stations. Users/BrentLaabs
