20100208 22:24:43 nbsp Hey Rob,

What I did was look up some trouble shooting techniques for refrigerators.  Im guessing from what I read that the auto defrost is not working because of some kind of blockage to the venting in the freezer.  Also there could be a slight leak in the door seal which would cause unwanted frost to build up.  Either way you have to manually defrost the freezer and then test it out to see if it works normally.

Start by emptying the freezer  and defrost it.  You will want to plan on eating most of the really perishable items so that when you do unplug the fridge/freezer you wont be wasting food.  When you do go to unthaw the freezer you will let it warm up until you can chip away (carefully) all of the ice.  Once you get all of the ice and moisture out you can plug it back in and test.  Put some normal freezer items in the freezer like ice trays and frozen veggies.  Check the seal of the door also.  Then make sure that the fridge is not working too much and overheating.  Occasionally you will have to defrost for older models of refrigerators.

If after you test it out and get the same major frosting in the freezer and overheating of the fridge compartment you might try setting the temperature controls.  If you still get improper function then you might want to look into getting an energy star refrigerator.  Your old refrigerator can be picked up for a $30 credit from PG&E and there is a $75 rebate for qualifying new refrigerators.
Let me know how this works out and Ill attach a link to a trouble shooting web site that you might find helpful.

Basic types of HETs:

Gravity flush Toilets – use the weight of water to create a siphon action that pulls water and waste from the bowl.
PressureAssist Toilets – have a sealed vessel inside the tank and use air pressure to force a flush. Users/charlespersson
