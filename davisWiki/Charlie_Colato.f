 Candidate Statement 

EXPERIENCE
Refounding member and president, Phi Delta Theta California Epsilon

Member of Davis Alcohol and Other Drugs Advisory Group (DAODAG), 20102011
Business Director, Picnic Day 2010

Within ASUCD, I independently restructured and consolidated the Picnic Day Board of Directors, which resulted in increased efficiency and pay for directors. I also increased sustainability funding by 500% for student groups participating in the Picnic Day Student Organization Faire and I enhanced Picnic Days familyfriendly purpose by expanding the Multicultural Childrens Faire.

Platforms:
IMPROVE CAMPUS SAFETY
We need to guarantee that Picnic Day remains a viable event by ensuring that its attendees are able to enjoy the day, free of harassment and encroachment. We also need to provide the necessary resources to ensure that our underrepresented communities feel safe and welcomed at Picnic Day and at all ASUCD events. We can accomplish this by increasing the use of Aggie Hosts throughout campus. I will also work with the office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs to get them to provide university monitors who can provide conflict mitigation as well as data collection on the occurrences of harassment and hate crimes so that the resources are properly appropriated for future Picnic Days and other ASUCD events.

FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
All ASUCD Units should be on track to meet the 2020 UCwide zero waste mandate. I pledge to work with ASUCD Unit Directors and campus leaders to ensure that a master plan is developed to lay out a pathway to zero waste well ahead of 2020. I believe that partnerships should be established between the private and public sector to ensure we are maximizing all avenues that lead to landfill diversion, efficient energy use, and greenhouse gas reduction A particular interest of mine would be to reduce the amount paper that is used for Picnic Day. Roughly 1500020000 Schedule of Events (SOE) are printed every year and I would like to cut that in half. With the rise in popularity of smartphones, I believe that we can reduce the amount of SOEs printed by delivering the same information digitally via a mobile app.

VOTE Charlie Colato #1 for ASUCD Senate and BOLD #26!
