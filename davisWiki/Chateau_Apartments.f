20050903 10:20:55 nbsp I just moved into Chateau yeasterday, and some of the stuff here is wrong, at least for my apartment. As far as I can tell, there is no microwave in my apartment, or real central air. There is one air conditioning type large vent above the kitchen/living room, but its controls are too high up for me (53) to reach. True DSL is not provided, but instaconect is. Contrary to what they say, its nowhere near as fast as DSL and at least at my old apartment, Sequoia (North Davis on Sycamore), was incredibly unreliable. EDIT: Instaconnect guys are trying to increase the speed of my connection because of this post. I am impressed, I didnt even call or ask them. Good job instaconnect. Youre getting better. I also havent had any reliability problems with internet here at Chateau. Users/LuisdelaTorre

20060122 16:56:13 nbsp Chateau is onehalf block away from the Amtrak Station.  Good for trainspotting, but bad for noise. Users/MattJurach

20081014 11:50:10 nbsp Oh wow, where do I begin.  Chateau Apartments is as comical a name for this place as you can find.  For that matter, the King in King Properties probably stands for how they treat you like lowly pieces of crap.  Do not movein here if you have a chance.  King Properties did little to alleviate the issues of the methheads living in two separate rooms above us.  They broke our fence (twice), they made constant disruptions.  On top of putting up that business, King Properties has the audacity to overcharge us (like $900 off a $1600 deposit) at the end of our lease.

If you find yourself in a bind and having to move in here, do what we didnt and DOCUMENT EVERYTHING with photographic evidence.  There has to be proof of the already preexisting crappy conditions of the place.  Otherwise, King Properties will gleefully rape you on your deposit with nary an apology.    Users/MK

20120710 22:10:55 nbsp Do not move in here!!!! Ever since day one it has been problem after problem. The landlord doesnt respond to any form of communication and there is no emergency maintenance line. If something goes wrong, it is your responsibility to get it fixed because you will never get a hold of the landlord. Only plus side is that it is a great location. That is about it. It is righ next to the train station and it is very loud, the walls are thin as paper and you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the complex. Dont make the same mistake I did and find a place where you can rely on the landlord of your heater breaks in the winter or if you get mice because this one wont lift a finger.Â  Users/SRoz
