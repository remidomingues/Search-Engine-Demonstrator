Chautauqua Apartments is located on the northwest corner of the Alvarado/Anderson Road Anderson roundabout, and across the street from Casitas, another Tandem Properties complex with which it shares a management, maintenance, and landscaping crew.

Management at Chautauqua is very friendly and makes repairs promptly, often without charge; they occasionally put on social events for residents, like pizza parties and finalsweek breakfasts where there is always more than enough (free!) food to go around. Residents amenity keys (given at movein) also access the pool, study lounge, and laundry rooms at Casitas.

There are occasional parties in Chautauqua, but they rarely get out of hand or obnoxious. Most neighbors are friendly enough to let you know if they plan on having one so you can prepare. Most residents at Chautauqua are either grad students or law students and this tends to keep the noise down (but people also get peeved quicker about noise).

I looked at two apartments at this place. I absolutely loved the layout of the studios with lofts. The reason I didnt pick this place is because the front doors are sliding glass and do not deadbolt. If you are a female looking for your own place, not having a front door and only having a sliding glass one is weird. Also, there are very very few windows in the place. The layout is cool, and is spacious (two story townhouse feel, even though its a studio with loft). There are currently two people trying to sublease their apartments, call the office. I recommend seeing both apartments if interested in this complex.

   It is a little weird not having a front door but putting a piece of wood/metal to lock the door is probably just as safe as a deadbolt. The one story studios also dont have windows (mine doesnt) but the airflow is suprisingly not that bad considering (Note: I havent yet experienced summer in the apartment). I have been in apartments in the trees that would get no airflow even with all the windows open. Overall its been alright living here although its very difficult to find parking if you get home late at night.

  How do you lock the door when you leave? Users/hankim

  Hi hankim.  The doors have a keyed lock which can be opened and locked from outside.  Turning the key sends a metal hook into the metal frame of the door, just like turning a key to a dead bolted lock sends a metal pin into the wooden door frame.  Admittedly, having a sliding glass door as your primary entry is unique,  but in terms of safety, its really no different than having a sliding glass door onto a patio from your living room (something that many apartments provide.) This was done in our smaller units to allow for them to have better fresh air circulation in addition to being able to use the heater/AC unit. Users/ChautauquaManagement

  Hello all, we are actually in the process of replacing the sliding glass doors! All units that previously had this style door are being fitted with new French Doors that allow plenty of light in and are equipped with with deadbolted locks! New doors, new Chautauqua! We also have several floorplans that have been recently been remodeled! Come check them out today! Users/ChautauquaManagement

20060313 00:41:40 nbsp I recently looked into renting a 1 bedroom unit with a loft at Chautaugua.  The loft works great as an office or den.  The kitchen looked a bit older than some of the other places I looked at, but depending on your taste might be ok.  The unit I looked at was going for $1060 as of March 2006 Users/GuyGordon

20070114 20:40:57 nbsp I just put my name on the waiting list for ChautauQua and noticed the sliding glass front door and thought it was odd too. But my cousin also advised me to place a piece of wood where the door would slide when I want it locked. He also suggested asking the management if I could drill a small hole in the sliding door and place a pin into it to stop the door from sliding (like a dead bolt). But does anyone know if there are sliding screen doors as well? Users/AlexisGutierrez
  When I lived there, my apartment had a screen door. Users/CarlMcCabe CM


20070307 12:44:49 nbsp I personally thought the one bedrooms here were really nice. The sliding glass door is a little weird, but I think it would be nice during hot summers? The three bedrooms at Chautauqua is a little dark but other than that they are pertty decent apartments. A lot of space too! The office people were really nice. The leasing agent showed me literally all the different apartments they had. I swear he had too much sugar or something, but he was really nice and funny. The Casitas apartments are managed by the same office. I really really really liked their duplexes. All in all, a good place to live! Users/Anonymous

20070912 22:46:45 nbsp My parents liven in a loft here in the early 70s when the complex was new

good times Users/StevenDaubert

20090329 11:05:16 nbsp For the price, this apartment is very run down and dilapidated. The fan in the bathroom doesnt work so you get a buildup of black mold, the free DSL is about as fast as dialup so its basically semifalse advertising without full disclosure, the office staff is very reluctant to fix some things that dont work well like the fan. They refuse to replace or fix anything unless its completely broken and theyre required to. The sliding glass door gets annoying and is quite frankly just stupid. The maintenance staff are very friendly though and the office staff are as well. The apartments themselves have never been renovated since the 70s either, the kitchen is old, some parts of the counter are permanently dirty and stained. I would never stay here again. Users/emttim84

20090330 09:18:22 nbsp Hi Tim,  Im sorry to hear of your frustrations.  If you ever feel that your concerns were not properly addressed, I would hope that you feel comfortable enough with management to let us know. While its true that Chautauqua is not as new and modern as Tandems more recently constructed communities, our pricepoint compared to our newer sister sites, is reflective of that.  Our interiors are maintained and we did go through a full renovation in the 1990s.  I cannot always accommodate renovation or upgrade type requests, but our maintenance staff is very prompt to replace things that are indeed not properly functioning or are showing excessive signs of wear.  Like most apartment communities that do not offer windows in the bathroom, proactive measures like running the bathroom fan for a bit both while and after showering, wiping down the walls if excessive condensation from a hot or long shower develops, and cracking windows occasionally in your apartment and/or running your air conditioner, are all a part of controlling the internal humidity in your apartment.  A bit of bathroom mildew can happen in any apartment community to even the most proactive housekeeper.  If that happens to you, a quick wipedown with a bleach and water solution during your regular cleaning routine (be sure to use the products as directed) should do the trick.  If you need a bit of help in the process, just let us know and wed be happy to show you how.  As for the FREE DSL, it wont be as fast as a T1 or digital connection...but the price makes it a very satisfactory amenity to most of our community. :)  If youd like information about upgrading the service, I can put you in touch with our service provider.   Even if you wont be staying with us for another year, wed like to help you feel comfortable here until you go.  Take care. Users/ChautauquaManagement

20090419 16:57:55 nbsp This is a very unsafe place to park your car!!! First, management is very nice and repairs are swift. Probably the best management here in Davis. But the apartments are very rundown for the price of rent, you can find someplace cheaper and brand new, but perhaps without the nice management. However, over my lease term several cars have been broken into, at least one motorcycle, and two of my roommates cars have also been broken into (this is what prompts me to write this). Nothing was stolen, there was nothing to steal hence these are people doing it simply b/c they can and theres no incentive not to. So if you have a car you are warned, as is my right to warn you. Oh, and I read the comment about the mold and its in everyones apartment. So if you dont want to be battling mold every weekend, and I mean every weekend, another reason not to live here. Use bleach, leave your doors open, nothing works it just grows and grows.  Users/chatres
  Can management do anything to prevent seemingly random criminal stupidity?  Probably not save raising rent for private patrols and monitoring (a gated community may be ideal).  Mold is certainly within their jurisdiction although to varying degrees residents would certainly be responsible if less than adequite measures are taken.  Mold is not an isolated problem which is why most leases and addendums emphasize prevention.  Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090424 15:46:06 nbsp Today we got a notice from the management that tandem is hiring offduty cops to patrol our parking lots as well as other complexes due to the increase in car vandalism and theft in the area. So thanks for the comment ryan, but it looks like management can do something about it and they are. I truly hope this increases the safety of our parking lots and really appreciate Tandem Properties for their honest concern for their residents. I still have to say that the apartments are old and falling apart, but my comments about how this is the best management in davis, well, I prove my point.  Users/chatres
  Im honestly pretty glad to hear that although I wonder at what cost.  I was concerned about the problem mentioned as Ill be moving into Chautauquas Casitas sister complex this summer.  So its great to know that management decided to take some action despite not having any obligation to do so!  Terrific. Thanks for the update. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091004 11:10:22 nbsp Ive lived here only for like a month. The property itself is really quiet, the management is really nice, but I really regret living on the first floor. The structures are old, so I can practically hear the people upstairs talk, watch TV, or move at all. Im constantly woken up in the middle of the night bc of their dog and frankly feel sleep deprived and tired in the morning. Sleeping in on the weekends is not an option. I would totally live here again if the studios were offered on the second floor though.  Users/PP

20100721 10:40:47 nbsp The managers are great, and what few repairs we needed were done quickly. Users/johnfisher

20100922 09:06:10 nbsp Despite the fact that the apartment looks a little rundown but this is one of the best apartment I have lived in Davis.
The managements are very nice and reachable.
J and G bus lines are the best.
Well, there are some down sides also.
1) It is NOT central heating
2) MOLD is an issue but if you clean it constantly, it will no longer be an issue. ( I later found out that because of the pain they use is not mold resistant)
However, I still recommend future tenant to stay here based on my overall experience. Users/IanChau

20110212 15:52:39 nbsp Ive enjoyed my time here at Chautauqua. Currently I live in a one bedroom + loft apartment. The apartment itself is very cozy, and has a lot of natural light during the daytime although the amounts may vary depending on what time it is, obviously. The upstairs loft which is used as a second bedroom in my apartment gets a TON of natural light because of the large skylight up there. Yes, the complex is older, but it is nice. The apartments are actually getting a lot of renovations recently; NO MORE SLIDING GLASS FRONT DOORS! D Now we have real Frenchstyle! doors with horizontal blinds and REAL locks! Additionally the sliding screen doors have been replaced with retractable screen doors, which I find super convenient. The complex itself is really quiet, although its not boring; occasionally people throw parties but to be completely honest, I never hear any of them. Once in awhile you can hear parties going on at Casitas across the street but its no big deal.

I LOVE the management team here. Theyre super nice, are always helpful, and friendly. Theres a coffee maker in the lounge area and you can actually get a key to access the lounge area of the rental office whenever you want; current policy states that you have to sign a form with all the rules read, blah blah blah, and you get the key for 2 weeks at a time. The repair team is prompt too... all my requests go through within a day and a half usually. If you have any issues regarding your apartment or lease, etc, the management team is really helpful and willing to assist you.

Id definitely recommend living here.  Users/kimmisan

           Hi Juliebess,

            I haven’t heard many complaints about this issue but I’d like to make sure you’re comfortable. Please stop by my office when you have a moment. I’d like to ask you a few questions and see if I can help. :)
