20090325 23:28:14 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName. Another way to look at it is if you cant answer the question Your Five Favorite Things In Davis what are your five favorite things in Davis? because of the name you are posting under... maybe you need to change your name. Users/JasonAller

20090430 09:32:13 nbsp Good catch.  I thought I had double checked the floorplan info but missed one anyway!   Hooray for community edited websites.  Thanks for keeping the Chautauqua two Casitas apartment pages up to date. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20100108 19:15:56 nbsp You removed pricing information from two apartment listings today. Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Users/JasonAller

20100128 11:01:43 nbsp Close this account immediately by going to wiki:wikispot:User Settings. Then, create an account and edit under your real name. Users/WilliamLewis

20100128 11:51:43 nbsp Hello William and Jason, I am confused as to why you are deleting our contributions to our apartment pages.  We have been using this user name to provide helpful updates to potential residents for quite some time without any problems.  We always label our updates clearly as “announcements from management.”  We are respectful of other users posts and never delete or edit any comments.  Why are you deleting our updates?  While I respect your opinion that you’d like to see us use our actual names, please understand that this is a business screen name.  The person updating is not always the same, and we issue only updates on behalf of the company.  Any updates not related to Tandem Properties, are of course done with individual screen names as the use of a business name in that context would be inappropriate.  Please do not unfairly remove our posts as we too have a right to contribute helpful content to a community based page. Users/ChautauquaManagement

   Jason is not removing your contributions, only I am.  Users/WilliamLewis

   That was a really well written reply. It deserves an equally well written response which I dont have time for right now. Users/JasonAller
    Youve addressed me by name, but I cant extend the same courtesy to you because I dont know your name. I would prefer to because that would build a sense of community and that is why I spend as much time fixing things on the wiki as I do. I did look at your http://daviswiki.org/Users/ChautauquaManagement?actionuserinfo edit history and I agree that youve been either a respectful editor or group of editors. Thank you for that and either way you decide on the username issue I hope you will continue to stick around the wiki and contribute. Unfortunately recent events have created a situation where other Self Interest Single Topic EditoRs (SISTERs) have caused enough problems for the editors who take the time to clean up formatting, link pages, and remove spam that tempers and patience have both been short. The very fact that Ive switched to referring to them as SISTERs instead of dealing with them as individuals speaks to their collective lack of wiki identity. Your well written response automatically removes you from that larger group, but I want to present some reasons for you to completely remove yourself from the association you share with them due to your choice of username.

   My first reaction without having viewed your edit history when I saw Williams edits was Dang, he drew a line in the sand and he is going to start standing behind it, I guess Users/RealComputers really ticked him off. Now there is an alternative to politely asking SISTERs to change their ways, we will treat them like we treat spammers. After reflection I think that his course of action may still prove viable for some of the worst offenders, but it shouldnt be used as a general response. I do want to point out that William is the first line of defense against spam at Wiki Spot and as such he deals with some of the most abusive and nonresponsive stuff that any editor has to put up with. He deserves thanks from all of us for doing that; it doesnt make it right that you happened to fall into his cross hairs while he was dealing with an extremely frustrating situation.

   The issues surrounding a persons choice of nomdekeyboard have been an ongoing discussion in several forms over the last few years. If you look on the Wiki Community/Organizational accounts page youll see portion of that discussion; other pages with part of the history include Importance of using your RealName and identity. My take has been that people tend to be more polite when they stand behind their words with their real name; which can either be by using it as their username or by disclosing it on their Users/ page. Along the way Ive acknowledged the very positive contributions of editors like Users/AlphaDog and Users/CovertProfessor whos identity remains a mystery to this day. While it has been talked over the issue of it being nonenforceable has always relegated any potential solution to making polite requests of those editors who choose to use role or organizational account usernames. Recently I changed my approach and started using the following as my request:

    Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Organizational accounts pose several problems, but the core issue is that they detract from a sense of community when one or more people use the name of an organization. This leads to a sense of faceless, impersonal action rather than the actions and statements of a member of the community. As a member of the Davis community, your contributions are very much appreciated, but it would be better if you make them using your name rather then the name of your organization. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions please do so.

   I didnt add in a few other items because I wanted to keep it general and not stir up secondary arguments. In addition Id add that role accounts can be used to intimidate other editors and project a sense of ownership of a page. It would be equally wrong for me to edit under the following usernames: Users/WikiAdmin, Users/Manager, DavisWiki, Users/Administrator, ChiefofPolice, SueGreenwald, LibelLawyer, Owner etc. You will note that some people have created some of those accounts and used or abused them. In fact there is a whole list of those on the Wiki Community/Organizational accounts page.

   I came up with that request statement because I do a lot of the cleanup around the wiki and I was disappointed by the lack of participation in the larger wiki by the SISTERs who shared the following characteristics:
     They edit only pages in which they have an apparent financial interest or to add links to those pages on other pages.
     They are in a rush to promote their interests and dont take the time to learn what things like the {{{||}}} that make up tables mean which results in other editors having to come along and clean up after them. Many of them express no interest in learning and continue to repeat those same mistakes.
     Often they delete history, and sometimes they delete other editors comments.
     When they do interact with other editors they are often abusive in their dealing because they view the wiki as a high traffic web site where they can host content for free.
   This was frustrating because I tried reaching out to them as fellow editors and they either ignored those messages or responded with a sense of entitlement about the ownership of what they perceived as their page. In your case Id change what Im asking and ask that you abandon this username because if you keep it it will be that much harder to get those who are abusive to change theirs. I know a change of name wont magically solve all of the problems, but Im hoping that it will have a positive impact on both the sense of community and editors sense of responsibility for what they say. Users/JasonAller

20100128 11:53:45 nbsp It has been noted several times that you should not use an account with a name like this, and yet you continue to make edits with it. I figured the only way youd take this seriously is if your edits using this account would be removed.

Please understand that this wiki is a community of individuals and that this community believes that business screen names are inappropriate here. Users/WilliamLewis

20100128 12:23:45 nbsp Hello William.  Please understand that our reason for using a business name because it is very important for us to do what is respectful and appropriate in a community based web setting.  We have set up this account with a business name to avoid the mingling of personal opinions which don’t belong linked with our general apartment updates.  As  apartment management staff members, we work hard to keep our “work” opinions general.  For example at work, we don’t evoke personal religious opinions, as doing so might be seen as a way of isolating renters with other such opinions.  I fear that by forcing us to use individual names for apartment updates, you will remove our ability to contribute open opinions on other matters in our free time. I believe the user CovertProfessor  uses a name other than his own for a similar reason.  I’m confused as to why the same understanding cannot be expressed to us.   Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100128 13:13:10 nbsp Jason, Im sorry that I didnt see your comment on removing prices sooner.  The prices were removed because they were no longer reflective of fall rates.  People were calling confused because of information they had seen on Wiki.  At the time that I removed them, our main office had not yet set our rates for fall.  Our fall rates are now available at Tandemproperties.com.  Feel free to post the updated rates if youd like.  Id post them myself, but I it seems that might be a wasted effort if our updates are being removed. Thanks! Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100128 13:44:18 nbsp Hey, please dont get discouraged from contributing here!  Folks here are in the process of debating the organizational account name thing, and your inputs probably going to be helpful for us to figure out how to encourage / discourage the kind of behavior we want to see here.

So, for now, dont worry about your edits getting reversed  and feel free to update the prices on the pages!

Someone else will probably chime in with why they feel organizational accounts are a Not Good Thing, but you make some good points about why theyre useful.  Whats been missing from our discussion about wiki community/organizational accounts organizational accounts has been the perspective of a (larger) business owner.  Ive put some of your thoughts over on that page  and perhaps you can chime in more there, too. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100208 16:45:03 nbsp Thank you for understanding our reasons for using our business/staff name.  We have read all of the suggested discussions.  While we’re sure it’s frustrating for you when anyone abuses the Wiki, we appreciate your willingness to appreciate that there are some of us editing under a business name simply because we feel it most clearly identifies who is speaking, protects the privacy of employees who otherwise might be hesitant to participate, and allows us to accomplish our goal of controlling that our staff contributes in a professional and respectful way.  We also read your discussion about nonprofit status and posting prices.  Consequently, we didn’t repost prices to the page.  Take care. Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100208 16:48:32 nbsp Hey, you can totally post prices for apartments (please do!)  We are still refining that guideline.  Prices for apartments are definitely okay. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100317 15:42:09 nbsp Wow, that really sucks about the spam from having the managers name listed.  What kind of stuff were you getting, if you dont mind my asking? Users/TomGarberson

20100331 15:16:38 nbsp Hello Tom.  Its unfortunate, but it seems that more and more companies are becoming very aggressive with their telemarketing and fax marketing.  We have people contacting the office on a consistent basis trying to sell us goods and services.  They often try to get their foot in the door by saying they are returning a phone call from a particular staff member.  Weve even had people go so far as to try to get staff to authorize charges by pretending to be a legitimate vendor.  The result has been quite a mess of paperwork and backandforth on our end.  Its a shame that some people can be so dishonest. Users/ChautauquaManagement
  Funny, here on the wiki we have Wiki Community/Organizational accounts/Abuse similar problems that come from people who dont edit using their own identity. The sales people arent positive members of your community, and a lot of Organizational accounts arent positive members of the Wiki Community. Users/JasonAller

20100520 18:03:07 nbsp Heh.  No worries.  I was just amused by all the bolding and exclamation points!.  My edit comments are often lighthearted observations or goofy humor.  No insult intended; if I actually had an issue with any of the edits, I would have been much more serious and contacted you (although, considering you use a group title, I wouldnt really be sure who to address or who I was talking to). Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100520 18:10:51 nbsp You can call us Chautauqua. :)  Were Casitas and Chautauqua management.  The editor is not always the same.  Currently our team consists of Jackie, Bethany, Kristina, Rebecca, Bobby, Tom, Maria and Arath...but our staff can change from time to time. :) Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100521 12:56:29 nbsp Thanks for keeping the relevant apartment pages up to date.  Can you, when contributing material, please avoid using promotional language?  Please see Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions for more details.  For instance, Come see us TODAY! is promotional.  We have a special until Monday is less so. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100522 10:31:55 nbsp Hello Phillip.  We will try to accommodate your request.  Admittedly  this may be a bit tough as staff is still new to trying to neutralize or edit our speech for the Wiki.  We are very careful not go overboard on our contributions to the general parts of the Wiki page. We just assumed that since the Notes from Management section is quite clearly us speaking, that there was a bit more freedom to be ourselves in that section.  Well be making a few more edits to try to better update and clarify current information. Our plan is to add an concise availability column like the one we had last year to help clarify which units are available for now, for early summer movein, and for fall.  We receive a lot of phone calls requesting immediate and summer movein and we hope that posting this info will help the public.  Just as we did last year, we will add a note that clearly marks when the information was last updated.  Well do our best to leave clear comments for the edits. Thank you for helping us be positive members of the Wiki community.  ;) Users/ChautauquaManagement

20100604 22:46:08 nbsp Why remove a historical picture from the page? Users/JasonAller

20100604 22:57:59 nbsp Hi Jason.  The old picture is below with a caption.  The new picture more accurately shows what things look like today.  :) Users/ChautauquaManagement
