20070326 16:39:44 nbsp When the Yolobus to the airport was full, I called Checker Cab. They arrived quickly, the ride was comfortable, and I got to my flight on time. I will definitely call them the next time I need a ride. Users/MichaelMurray

20080329 15:46:02 nbsp This is the best cab company in town by far, the drivers are the nicest there are.  Dan on the weekend nights is great an always on time!!!!  I will always call Checker Cab first! Users/dnm12

20080920 12:46:45 nbsp Stuck without a car and needing to get my old dog to the vet, Randy really went out of his way to help me. Great company! Users/MichellePalmer

20090622 12:16:26 nbsp Highly recommended!  Picked me up on a last minute call after an aggravating noshow by Yolo Airporter (should be Nolo Airporter). Very nice folks.  Will go out of their way to make sure you get where you need to go when you need to get there. Users/katzwest

20090730 22:48:03 nbsp My ride with Yoloairporter just informed me 15 minutes ago that they cant give me a ride but they wished me the best, so naturally I hoped on to DavisWiki and came to this entry  let met just say, this service is excellent. Although they were unfortunately busy during the time I needed to get to SFO, they helped me out far more than YoloAirporter. Id highly recommend this taxi company for its service. Users/AlexNelson

20091217 22:49:27 nbsp Checker cab is a winning proposition, safe, courteous drivers who are prompt and punctual. Dan is the man at checker cab and that is no lie people. Randy cares about making things right, so be sure to let him know if you felt let down! Users/StevenDaubert

20100914 16:10:49 nbsp Finally: quick response (HONEST estimation per wait time), neat/ clean vehicle (no cig. butts, stained seats, foul odors); what a pleasant surprise after having delt with other cab services in Davis. ! Thanks from Rick @NorCal Garage, Dixon.  Users/RichardDurland

20100923 13:43:36 nbsp This company is reliable and responsible.  Do not use Village or Davis Taxi.  Village promised to call me back but never did and Davis Taxi recommends Village!  Hmmmmmmm. Users/thelmaleegross

20100923 17:53:51 nbsp I would like to take a moment to personally thank Checker Cab for
the many referrals they have sent Village Cab over the years and also express my gratitude
for the times they have fielded calls for Village Cab. Randy & Hilda, I and all the drivers
here at Village THANK YOU!  David Max Placencia  Users/DavidPlacencia

20101212 15:14:38 nbsp Checker is the first service I call whenever a guest at La Quinta needs a ride. If Randy cant make it, which DOES happen, he generally knows whos more likely to be available. Ive heard nothing but good about his service from guests and definitely recommend Checker first. :) Users/KBathory

20131230 07:01:46 nbsp The day before, I scheduled a 6AM pickup with Randy for the next morning. The next day, I tried calling just before six to confirm he was on his wayI needed to catch a 6:30 bus to the airport where he was dropping me off. He didnt answer, so I waited. Once it hit 6:08 or so, I started calling. After 4 calls and one message, all left unanswered, I frantically called other cab services, but the ones who answered very kindly and honestly let me know they werent going to make it on time. I was able to squeeze in last minute with a Davis Airporter, thankfully, but this was way more stress than anyone needs. :( Users/JuliaNeal
