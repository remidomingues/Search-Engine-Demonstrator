Chefs Market sold a variety of prepared European foods. Their most popular items included panini, other Sandwiches, cheese, olives, other kind of tapaslike foods, and Wine. If you needed an event catered, they made classy variety plates.

Seating was available inside and outside, and you could listen to jazz/flamenco Fri/Sat 6pm.

They were getting Wifi hot spots WiFi, a 200602 banner proclaims.

20050404 20:04:52 nbsp Friday night flamenco is awesome. Sean (the flamenco guy) is pretty good, and the waitresses there are obscenely hot and nice. Theyre pricey, but good place to bring a date or hang out with your buddies after a $6 pitcher at the Fish and Chips next door. Flamenco usually starts at 77:30 and goes until around 10.

20060126 18:48:50 nbsp Ive tried quite a few of their salads and a couple of their sandwiches, and have yet to be disappointed. Just great, gourmet food, served counter style. Bonus: They usually have some good music playing, too! Users/SerenaDonovan
  Oh, the music sucked when I was in there! They were playing KDVS ... which isnt a bad station, but very VERY random and untrained D.J.s that say um and uhhh a lot.

20060219 15:14:43 nbsp I concur about the waitresses ... holy crap, I have no idea why they work in a restaurant! I went into Chefs market for the first time yesterday. I noticed the European flares from their selection of drinks. They carry Aranciata and Limonata, but no Oragina! Whats more, they have a European advertisement of Orangina. WTF, mate? They also carry one of my favorite drinks; a french lemonade in a pearshaped bottle. The only other place Ive seen it is at various La Bous. As for the prices, theyre not that bad. Unfortunately, the price doesnt match the quality. My friend and I got a sandwich each and found it to be kind of meager. It was pretty tasty (I got the New York), but it reminded me of Delta of Venuss sandwiches, and if I had my pick Id go there instead. Also, you could tell that the restaurant was kind of under independent ownership, because the person in question only had two people working the entire place (when it was relatively busy), and they were nice people, but not that attentive.

20060402 18:49:40 nbsp I went here last night with a few Davis friends and we all loved it. The place was almost completely empty, save for us and the live musicians. Id recommend their El Greco panini: grilled mushrooms, sprouts and tomato. Yum! Users/StacieTownsend

20060511 14:34:07 nbsp Sorry Folks! My experience was very disappointing. In my quest for a Caesar salad, I thought this would be a refreshing find. Unfortunately I paid almost $11 for wilted lettuce, processed chicken and average dressing from a plastic jug. Maybe the servers were hot, and nice, but they were much more interested in their gossip of the day than in making my salad. Chefs Market has potential, but in this case, it did not deliver.

20060806 12:21:58 nbsp We wanted to go here for some tapas for a friends going away party.  When we got there, they were closing two hours early.  Irritating.  I have eaten lunch here a few times over the years, and the sandwiches have been okay. Users/MisterProfessor

20060904 16:16:03 nbsp This restaurant looked interesting, so I decided to try it. I first tried a beef pastrami sandwich with Swiss, but the meat was very bland. Next, I tried a New York which was beef and gorgonzola with lettuce, and it was pretty good (its the cheese) except when grilled, the bread becomes hard and the soft contents squish out when you bite the sandwich. They have a good selection of cheeses, and sometimes people come in to stare at them, and the manager will also show you the wines on the back wall if you ask. However, he has a bad temper and when customers arent looking, he throws things at his employees. My mother also tried a turkey pastrami sandwich (out of beef pastrami) and she was disappointed in the flavor of the meat. Maybe Im just particular about my Nugget sandwich meat, but they seriously need to get some better pastrami, and some sauerkraut so you could get a pastrami Reuben. Germany is in Europe, you know  lets have a little less FrancoItalianocentrism (with English cheese) in sandwich shops, ok? Their bread is Village Bakery locallybaked, however. Users/KarlMogel

20061025 22:18:34 nbsp Definitely like their sandwiches and salads.  The grilled tomoato and mozarella panini is quite good although I think the cheese could be a little better.  The biggest complaint I have about this place is that they do not have high chairs so it is very complicated to eat there with my 1.5 year old.  It seems like it would be only a minimal effort for them to have one or two high chairs around.  We have suggested this many times to the staff but to no avail.   Users/JonathanEisen

20061031 23:42:15 nbsp Have been there several times in the last year or so.  My wife and I love it.  Their specialty are the Europeanstyle sandwiches or ‘paninis’, and compared to many other similar places I have been, they are exceptional. I don’t know any other place in Davis or surroundings were you can eat a ‘New York’ or ‘Siciliano’  (if you are into vegetarianstyle paninis) the way they are prepared there.  They have some unique creations (from the owner/chef), and had recently add new styles.   The place is somewhat small, but has a very inviting atmosphere and is attentively served by the owner and his staff.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and uniqueness of ingredients they use (imported European cheeses, salamis, artisanstyle bread, etc). Bottom line, great place to grab something quick to eat for lunch or dinner, and if you want to take your time, they also have some fun live music on weekends.  Trying their ‘sangria’ is also a must.  Highly recommended. Users/RodrigoCifuentes

20061227 18:09:31 nbsp Sorry to say but this fine eatery appears to have become a part of Davis history.  I spoke with an employee of a neighboring store and she said Chefs Market has gone out of business.  I just called the phone number and not even an answering system picked up.  Im sorry to see it go :( Users/DouglasPerera

20061230 18:50:04 nbsp I dont know that theyve gone out of business.  The Savvy Shoppe is leaving too.  Theres a landlord issue going on, according to the owner of Savvy Shoppe.  I couldnt get intimate details. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070111 13:33:18 nbsp Something to do with sublets and leases, seems like the lower area of the lofts has become a ghost town.  Too bad while the service was slow the sandwiches were really good.  At least the ones I got a chance to try were Users/JarrettNoble
