Thanks for all your work on the Students on the Autism Spectrum page, its looking really good.  /Talk pages are generally used for sorting out problems with content on a given page, although if you have any questions, its a good place to ask them.  If youd like ideas for adding to the page:
1) Links!  Having a whole paragraph packed with links can make it hard to read, but its worth tying the page to others.  Part of what makes the wiki great is that every page leads you to others.  A part of that is also creating links to the page.  Look around for pages that should lead to Students on the Autism Spectrum.  Maybe a link from the MIND institute page?  Certainly the Student Disability Center.  Im sure if you explore a bit, youll find a bunch of good options.

2) Headers.  You can tidy up the layout of a page by adding headers.  If you put equals signs around a word or phrase, it turns it into a header:
{{{ This is a first level (big) header }}}
{{{ This is a second level (medium) header }}}
{{{This is a third level (smallish) header}}} Users/TomGarberson

20120610 10:45:03 nbsp I really support the comment that you made on the Autism Awareness Association page.  Our society seems to have become obsessed with normalcy and with curing those who are different from the average (but arent we all?).  Im glad you spoke out.  Thats definitely a problem if the group is run by those who are neurotypical.

Having said that, though, I think it would be better to leave the AAA link on the Students on the Autism Spectrum page.  Some might find the organization useful, or at least want to know that it exists.  You can put a little comment next to it and explain that some question the orientation of the group (or however you want to put it). Users/CovertProfessor
