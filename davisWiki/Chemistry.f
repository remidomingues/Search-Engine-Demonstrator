The http://www.chem.ucdavis.edu Chemistry Department is located in the creatively named Chemistry Building and Chemistry Annex. Some of the labs for certain Chem classes, and certain offices are also located in the Sciences Laboratory Building on the first and second floors.

The Department offers BA and BS as well as Masters and PhD. degrees in Chemistry, additional, Forensic, Environmental, Pharmaceutical, and Physical  Chemistry, are offered as Applied Chemistry BS degrees.


Degrees
Not only can you just have your choice of plain vanilla or chocolate A.B. or B.S. degrees in the science, you can now have an emphasis, though the registrar has yet (61108) to add it to the general catalog. The website and department office has more information.
Environmental Chemistry
 A multidisciplinary approach to understanding chemistry as it occurs in natural environmental circumstances. Take chemistry courses alongside environmental toxicology, geology, biology, and most other environmental departments on campus.
Forensic Chemistry
Pharmaceutical Chemistry
An excellent choice for those who wish for a career in the pharmaceutical industry. This sort of chemistry has been responsible for many medicinal advances in the recent years.
Physical Chemistry
This is really for people who love physical and theoretical chemistry.

General Chemistry

  2A. General Chemistry
   Basic chemistry (PVnRT, electron configuration, limiting reactant problems, etc). Almost all of basic high school chemistry is reviewed with only a few new insights.  Bear in mind  thats still a whole year smushed into ten weeks.  Supposedly, the class is harder during Fall Quarter because thats when most of the premeds enroll, so if you need the class but arent a premed, sometimes waiting until Winter is the best option.

   2A was a piece of cake.  Dont worry about it, unless you totally were asleep during high school chem.  Users/PatrickSing
  I wouldnt put it off out of fear. I thought it was pretty manageable, even with several years since my chemistry experience Users/SterlingRipleyPhipps

   If you liked this, youll like Chem 110A and random chunks of Chem 124A.

  2AH Honors General Chemistry  A much smaller class  100 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests, definitely take it. The smaller class is worth it.  The labs are much cooler than in 2A. For example, when the class covers gas laws, you get to use liquid nitrogen to verify GayLussacs law. When Prof. True teaches this class, the curve is rather generous, being centered somewhere between a B+ and an A. Dont think that the class is easy, though. Everyone in the class worked their little butts off to get such grades.
   For Trues Fall 2005 class, an 89% total put me in the A+ Range. Of course, it was the last A+ or 89% total I ever received. Users/MaxMikalonis

  2B. General Chemistry
   pH (aka solution equilibria) and thermodynamics.  The MOST boring of the series and possibly the most difficult. This part of the series has arguably the most painful labs, heavy emphasis on titration and making graphs.
   If you liked this, youll like Chem 105/115, Chem 110C and parts of Chem 110B
       This was my favorite of the General Chemistry series, but it was definitely the hardest. Dr. Augustine teaches it during Winter and although hes a tough teacher, he makes lectures entertaining. For example, when lecturing on entropy, he demonstrated it with a forty of King Cobra. Users/AbbyLawson

  2BH. Honors General Chemistry  A much smaller class  50 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests or your Chem 2A grade, definitely take it.  The smaller class is worth it.  However, its tough.  If you go in expecting an easy A  or even an easy C  prepare to be disappointed.

  2C. General Chemistry
   Electrochemistry, radioactivity, transition elements, an introduction to organic chemistry, bonding and a whole mishmash of other stuff.  The most interesting of the series because of the variety (and cool trivia).  More concepts and not as many mundane calculations as in A or B.
   If you liked this, youll like 124A/B, Chem 105/115/125, and parts of Chem 110B

  2CH. Honors General Chemistry  A much smaller class  25 students.  If you qualify based on the assessment tests or your Chem2A or Chem 2B grade, definitely take it.  The smaller class is worth it.  There are also two three hour labs each week instead of one.  REALLY fun experiments that actually mean something.  However, this is a very tough class  its a third semester honors class.  Its counterpart  Chem 2C is the most difficult and least taken part of the series.  If you go in expecting an easy A  or even an easy C  prepare to be disappointed.
   This class is worth it in the sense that you already have a strong support group formed if you run into trouble, which with two labs per week and an average professor and one (of two) crazy TA youll definitely have plenty of. The professor for this course is much better than any chemistry 2C professor you could ever wish for. It is nevertheless a tough class. The average for the first test the past two years has been an F. (Exact numbers witheld to avoid embarressment) Users/TusharRawat
  Chem 2CH is TOUGH.  But, remember, F is a relative term.  Many profs aim for a 60 average on the test, which is technically a D.  Remember the curve  it is your friend. Users/SarahHillard
   Chem 2CH can and will run over you if you arent careful. The two 3hr labs make things much, much more difficult, and the times can limit your options if you, say, want to take Bis 1a the same Quarter (PLEASE DONT!!! TAKE 1B INSTEAD). I mean, it was nice distilling the ethanol from cheap american beer, but it took such a long time. The vast majority of the labs, for all 2hs, are do the 2 series lab, and then take it to that next step. The best thing about 2CH? The other students: No one goes through a full year of Honors Chem and hates it by the end, and the struggle of staying up all night doing your labs is a combination of survival tactics and a bonding experience. After spending up to 9 hrs per week with a group of people, you get to know them. Users/MaxMikalonis

Organic Chemistry

  8A. Organic Chemistry  Basic organic chemistry part I, even less intensive than the 118 series (see below). not for chem majors.

  8B. Organic Chemistry  Basic organic chemistry part II.

  118A. Organic Chemistry  First in the series of organic chemistry for health sciences majors. Covers SN1, SN2, E1, E2, stereochemistry, spectroscopy, etc. not for chem majors.
   The 118 series is offered over the summer at a discounted rate, given the increase in the popularity of this series (being the easy ochem requirement) this might be a good idea. ~DP
   This class will ease one into Organic Chemistry. A large part of 118A is review from General Chemistry. It begins to get tough when you hit SN1, SN2, E1, and E2 reactions, and alcohol and ether syntheses. If you can, take this class with Dr. Schore. Users/TusharRawat

  not too bad of a course. definitely a class where the material is more easily learned when understood rather than memorized. Users/fredchen
  Hmmmm . . . I dont remember this course as being easy, but then again I did take it with Dr. Kurth.Users/CurlyGirl26

  118B. Organic Chemistry  Covers alkane, alkyne, aldehyde, ketone, aromatic and diels alder reactions.

  evil. Users/fredchen

  118C. Organic Chemistry  Carboxylic acids and their derivatives, alkyl and acyl amines, ÃŸdicarbonyl compounds. Huzzah, youre done.


  128A. Organic Chemistry  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. However if you are a chem major, or otherwise forced into taking this class, it is not so bad. This class will cover the first few chapters of the text and go into the basic chemistry and nomenclature of simpler organic compounds (Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes), and have a healthy dose of review from previous chemistry classes. This class should be taken Sophomore year for all chemistry, and chemical engineering majors (or anyone who is equally compelled).

  128B. Organic Chemistry  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can. If you are still stuck as a chemistry major, or somehow otherwise forced to continue in this series, this class will be the most difficult of the three. It picks up where 128A left off, and introduces many functional groups, reactions, synthesis, and introduces spectroscopy. The topic include haloalkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxilic acids, ending with adols and esters. The course isnt terrible well suited to the quarter system, however it is possible to survive. This class should be taken in your sophomore year as a chemistry major or chemical engineer.

  128C. Organic Chemistry  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction. This class will continue on where the last went off with aromatic compounds, conjugated dyes, amines, azides, carbohydrates and amino acids.

  129A. Organic Chemistry Laboratory  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now. This class covers the basics of laboratory practices, starting with distillation. It is a fast paced class so it is always good to arrive on time and be in control, do not arrive late for the first day of lab as there are less seats than in 128A, also bring goggles so you can start work quickly. Good luck.

  129B. Organic Chemistry Laboratory  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now. Hurry. This class makes use of all laboratory practices learned in the previous, and focuses mainly on the synthesis of organic products. There are several reactions which will take quite some time in reflux, so bring a book to read or study while you wait.

  129C. Organic Chemistry Laboratory  Organic chemistry is evil.  Run away. As fast as you can.  In the opposite direction.  Now. Hurry.  While you still can.  Dont say I didnt warn you. If you are a chemical engineer, pharmaceutical or environmental chemistry major, you dont need to worry here.

  131. Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis   If you didnt like, nay ABSOLUTELY LOVE as though it were your twisted country cousin, or were not very very VERY nobel prize winning good at Chem 128/129 DO NOT WHATEVER YOU DO TAKE THIS CLASS.  Im dead serious.  I still dont know what possessed me...

  150. Chemistry of Natural Products  Youll appreciate natural product biosynthesis more if you take BIS 102/103 beforehand.


    Note on the 118 vs 128/9 series: Having taken some of each of the series, here are my thoughtsthe 118 series is very much more lecturebased, and for chem majors, it doesnt really give you the handson lab experience that you could benefit from. Of course, if you are a chem major, you should probably be taking an internship, which could make up for any gaps in technical lab skills. However, the 128 classes are also smaller courses, so any questions tend to be able to be answered. Users/HannahToru

Analytical Chemistry
  10 Forensic Chemistry
  104. Forensic Chemistry
  105. Analytical and Physical Chemical Methods  Lots of the same types of calculations as in Chem 2B.  Very little new material, just a lot of more in depth labs and write ups.  Very long theory sections.  You will spend a great deal of time writing up lab reports as well. There is a lecture in addition to the lab that isnt directly related, and the lab manual may need corrections.
   Despite being scary the labs are nice in introducing many techniques in chemistry, though sadly not NMR. ~Dp

  115. Instrumental Analysis  More 105.  Very little new material.  Long write ups.  Neat experiments (roughly 7).
     This is easily the most time consuming class I have taken at Davis. The lab manual is a poorly written joke and the teachers tend to have unreasonably high expectations. Many of the analytical instruments are prone to failure at random times so expect much frustration.  Users/DanMasiel
     Agreed, as a chemistry student progresses in labs, there is less enrollment in the classes which corresponds to a decrease in funding. This is made worse by the increased cost of maintaining the machines. Lab manuals have yet to be revised and this class promises to consume your dreams and leave you mad. ~DP

  121. Introduction to Molecular Structure and Spectra  Good class.  Lots of hard theory and very little reading of actual spectra. Discusses indepth the relationship between QM and spectroscopy.
   note on 121: Decently tough if you dont have a strong pchem background, I imagine. The professor, Nancy True, is really smart, but Im mixed about her as a teacher. Its clear her desires lie with research, but shes a decent, if overly ambitious, teacher. She grades decently easy though, and encourages group work. users/HannahToru
  125. Advanced Methods in Physical Chemistry (4)  More spectroscopy.  VERY cool stuff.  VERY long write ups  only 4 experiments in the quarter.


Inorganic Chemistry

  124A. Inorganic Chemistry: Fundamentals  This is one of those classes that focuses a LOT on a very few basic ideas  if you dont understand symmetry and point group assignment, you will have a very difficult time drawing  molecular orbital diagrams (the final and hardest topic of the class).  Do yourself a favor and take this class before 110B or 107A.

  124B. Inorganic Chemistry: Main Group Elements  Lots of memorizing periodic trends and basic facts about the behavior of main group elements.  Zero theory.  No math above addition and subtraction.

  124C. Inorganic Chemistry: d and f Block Elements  Quite a bit of theory.  Here we see the return of microstates and reaction mechanisms.  Still not a whole lot of math beyond addition.

  124L. Laboratory Methods in Inorganic Chemistry  128A minus the carbon and with more pretty colors.  The lab reports dont necessarily have a theory section a la 105, 115 & 125, but the calculations are more complex than the O Chem counterpart. The lab manual and supplement are out of date and the former is usually in short supply in the book store. The class is entirely run by the P.P.Powers research group.
   The techniques used in this class make many of the labs worth it, NMR, IR, and UVvisible spectroscopy are useful skills that will come in handy for the physical chemistry methods classes. ~DP

Physical Chemistry

  107A: Physical Chemistry for bio/other majors... part A
    These classes (both of them) are offered over the summer at a discounted price. ~DP
  107B: Physical Chemistry for bio majors... part 1

  110A. Physical Chemistry: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics  Quantum Mechanics.  If you like math, have a good working knowledge of Math 21AC, and enjoy theoretical stuffs, it is a fantastic class.

  110B. Physical Chemistry: Properties of Atoms and Molecules  Take 124A first or concurrently, because group theory is not given enough lecture time in this class.  Not the most interesting of the chemistry classes. More spectroscopy from 110A,  a throwback to 124A and a preview of 110C.

  110C. Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics, Equilibria and Kinetics  More and harder Chem 2B.

    A Note on PChem Physical Chemistry IS difficult.  But, I found Organic Chemistry to be MUCH MUCH worse, however.  If your math skills are strong, you should be fine.  However, if you can get away with taking the Physical Chemistry for life sciences majors (Chem 107/108, I believe) go for that.  Also, avoid Ng unless you are madly in love with PowerPoint  he apparently is.  Users/SarahHillard

          Additional note on pchem: While the 110 series is very mathbased, some of the professors (Like Larsen) focus very heavily on theory. The 110 series goes into depth and explains all the other chemistry youve learned before. I think chem majors should probably take the 110 course, personally. users/HannahToru


Pharmaceutical Chemistry
  130A  Pharmaceutical Chemistry  Examination of the design principles and experimental methods used in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry.


  130B  Pharmaceutical Chemistry  Continuation of course 130A with emphasis on case studies of various drugs and the use of computational methods in drug design.


Other Chemistry Courses
  100. Water Chemistry, a slightly difficult class that focuses heavily on the chemistry in natural aqueous environments.
  I thought this was a fabulous class. You get a real understanding of why pH not only matters in lab settings, but how its affected in our environments. Its one of the most useful classes Ive come across.  Users/HannahToru

  99. Undergraduate Research/Special Study  See 199, same note applies
  199. Special Study for Advanced Undergraduates  DO UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH!  Now.  It is the only way to get into grad school.
      Read the above over again 2 times. It is the best advice I have seen on the wiki.  Users/DanMasiel
      Dont be scared to show up at a professors office hour and ask them about working in their lab.  Most professors love having free undergrad labor, and Ive heard a rumor that if a professor has enough undergrads doing 199/194/99 units they can get out of teaching a class.  You will gain experience with things that most undergrads never even touch.  DO UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH!  Users/NathanSchley
  Word.  It is probably one of the best things I did as an undergrad.  Learned a ton and my efforts even culminated in a publication.  And I draw upon the skills I learned there even today (and Im no longer in science!).  Do yourself a favor and do research as an undergrad!  Yes, I mean, YOU.Users/CurlyGirl26

Perhaps this page would be more useful with personal accounts/summaries of classes instead of a verbatim copy of the General Catalog.  After all, you can just link to the General Catalog and the website for the major to give people this information  Users/PhilipNeustrom

I second what Users/PhilipNeustrom said  Users/BryanBell

Yes!!!  Please, add your reviews of these classes.  Unless you liked organic chemistry.  All people who liked organic chemistry will be shot on sight.  Users/SarahHillard

Would anyone provide me more info on Physical Chemistry classes? I have finished General and Organic Chemistry, and I am gonna take physical chemistry in the fall. I have heard too many bad things about physical chemistry. I will appreciate any help. Thanks.  Users/JineshGheeya

Just for note, you can tell a chemist apart from a normal person by the way the pronounce unionized. Users/BrentLaabs

I do not see why people have such a hard time with organic chemistry, hence I will be starting to post a bit more information on it. On a side note, unionize is not a word, deionize is what you are looking for. Users/DavidPoole
  Organic Chemistry, at least the 118 series, consists of learning an enormous number or rules concerned with an even more enormous number of synthesis reactions. For people who like doing actual reactions with calculations, this course is hell. Rules, rules, and more rules. It is entirely possible for one who hates Chemistry to get a solid A in an OChem class, simply by memorizing said rules. That, and the fact that the vast majority of people dont study everyday, is the reason organic chemistry is hated. Oh, did I mention that it is a bit hard? Users/TusharRawat
   I completely agree with you, there are far too many rules, exceptions and exceptions to the rules. The actual concepts are quite interesting, but though we have  a theory of how everything works, it would be difficult to sit down and prove how it will work. ~Users/DavePoole (survivor)
    On a side side note, unionize is a word; it just doesnt have too terribly much to do with chemistry. Users/PaulCherng
     Having survived Ochem now (I hope), the difficulty is that there are quite a few reagents and functional groups, lets say 10 each minimum, this means that there are easily 100 reactions possible (assuming no reaction is a reaction of sorts); now take this system and add to it the complexity of having multiple functional groups on the same molecule, making synthesis difficult by limiting pathways and everything just all the more complex. Note that functional groups are also reagents and that there may be multiple molecules in the same system. This complexity is the reason why organic chemistry is so damn complicated and difficult. However, it also makes the classes pretty difficult for anyone, so stick in there and just dont fall behind more than everyone else (you dont need to out run the bear). ~Users/DavidPoole

      the problem with ochem(at least with 118b) is that there is simply too much material to learn in the time given in a quarter and almost no effective strategy of learning the material other than having a photographic memory because there are more exceptions than adherents to the given rules so that every piece of knowledge is pretty unconnected to other pieces Users/fredchen

20111222 14:30:30 nbsp Guys c mon its not that hard....I took 128A; and its definitely a mind fuck sometimes, but all in all, it makes sense why certain things happen.  Its just when you post stuff like RUN AWAY FROM THIS CLASS you are telling students not to learn and excel in these classes that benefit learning in general.  118 and 8 seem to be about memorizing reactions while 128 takes it to a different level and asks you why these reactions are occurring.  Dont scare people from these classes, encourage a necessary work ethic and learning capability for these students to do well.   Im seriously disappointed in this wikis need to veer kids off of science classes even if they may be a little bit hard.  If you put in the effort, the rewards will be immense.  Users/Kannan
 It was intended to be humorous. Some classes, however useful, awesome, and interesting, are just a pain in the ass. Looking back at the edit history, those remarks were made by Users/SarahEdwards, who earned a PhD in chemistry and is now a researcher at Vanderbilt. Users/WilliamLewis
