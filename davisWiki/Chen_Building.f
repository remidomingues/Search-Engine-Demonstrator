20070416 21:45:10 nbsp I was a huge fan of the Terminal Hotel Building. It was a real shame that it is gone. It was my favorite. Good memories. So because of that I will not go to any of the places in the Chen building.  Users/HeatherFlood

20090611 10:31:18 nbsp I dont know if I would go quite as far as HeatherFlood, but I am largely with her.  The Terminal Hotel was one of the few old buildings of character in downtown Davis which, despuite its good points, is architecturally almost a total dud.  It may have been in bad shape and I am a big fan of highensity mixeduse places, but it was a shame to see it go.   Users/Wulfstan
