There used to be a cherry tree in Davis, but RobRoy cut it down.  He promptly confessed.

However, there are plenty of other ways you can get your cherry fix:
  See Cherry Blossoms
  Bike Cherry Lane
  Eat cherry pie at XBakers SquareXBlack Bear Diner
  Sex Pop cherries
  See the Catalina Cherry on the Downtown Davis Treewalk
