Urban art can appear (and disappear) in the most unexpected of places.  For example, someone Senseless Act of Beauty painted the face of an orange cats cat on one of the storm water discharges along the arboretum next to the Arboretum Bridges footbridge just east of the Mrak Hall Drive bridge.   The cats face was orange with white teeth showing in its grin.  The cover went missing in the Summer of 2005 and has remained so for some time.  But, perhaps like the Cheshire Cat it will reappear.


There is a rumor that a girl painted it her freshman year (more than 10 years ago) and didnt reveal her identity until after she graduated, for fear of getting in trouble.

Theres another one, though not even nearly painted as well, near the end of the Arboretum, out past the Arboretum Gazebo Gazebo. Looks like someone outlined the ears, and painted a small catlike face in orange.
