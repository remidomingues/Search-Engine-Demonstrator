Chestnut Park is a very active community park. In good weather in the afternoons, it is often filled with pickup and teampractice soccer games, softball games, dog walkers, basketball players, tennis players, and of course, kids and their parents. At night, you never know who youll encounter there, from dog trainers to a group of medieval knights rumored to gather occasionally for sword play.

This parks park allowed for consumption of alcohol without a permit until the City Council passed a measure no longer allowing it on May 24th, 2005.  The ban of alcohol without a permit was due to a large number of residents complaining about not feeling comfortable in the park, due to a few drinkers that were spending most of the day, almost every day there. In the year before the measure was passed, the number of calls to the police regarding Chestnut Park exceeded the total number of calls received for the other major parks in the city. The measure became another town/gown flashpoint for Davis, as the residents felt that they were protecting their local park, while http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/06/02/Opinion/Editorial.Blanket.Regulation.Unnecessary1320793.shtml?norewrite200605061954&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com some students felt like it was yet another encroachment by the city on their rights.

Based on information available on the city Web sites, it appears that open containers and softball/baseball are still allowed together without a permit at Slide Hill Park and Westwood Park. They are also allowed at Community Park during hours when school is not in session and no school events are occurring. Please see the Wiki Open Container Ordinance page and visit the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/oco.cfm Official OCO page.

The lights at the basketball and tennis courts turn off automatically by 10pm.

For runners or walkers in the park, the loop inside the park is almost exactly onethird of a kilometer.  This makes it a good place to do running workouts. The Bike Paths bike path has connections to the culdesacs that back up to the park, Craig Place, Gregory Place, Penny Place, and Georgia Place.
