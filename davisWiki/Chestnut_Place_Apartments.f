20050701 12:50:20 nbsp No, it really is Mariachi music... Users/ArlenAbraham

20060720 13:51:25 nbsp Nice place overall, and conveniently located near the International Food Store and Symposium. Wallace (the landlord) is indeed a pretty nice guy; hes good about maintenance and hes the only landlord we had that didnt try to cheat us out of our damage deposit. Users/BarnabasTruman

20070514 17:58:29 nbsp Take these comments seriously.  They deleted the old negative comments.  If you love blasting mariachi music at all hours and screaming kids this is the place for you.  The police are regularly at the complex.  Cars are not safe in the parking lot.  3 weeks ago the police served a warrant on someone in the complex.  Theyre now out on bail and back at the complex.  If you look on the ground near the back you can see police markings outlining evidence spots.  Wallace Chan the landlord is nice and fixes things, he is very pleasant to deal with but he also rents to anyone.  He will not evict people from the complex even when they are criminals.  As I write this I am listening to blasting mariachi music.  If you move here, consider buying a gun, and a good pair of ear plugs.  You can also break a lease if you choose.  No court would side with Wallace Chan. Users/davisanonymousl

20071022 03:22:47 nbsp I am a current resident as of 102007.  These apartments have changed recently to be mostly Mexican families and Asian foreign exchange students.  Much quieter than it was in previous times.  Well worth the cheap price. Users/AGCohen

20080309 17:16:28 nbsp Ive lived here for a couple years and have enjoyed the price and the pool.  Wally is indeed a good landlord.  davisanonymousl was correct, 2007 was a bad year.  The meth heads, the gangstas and the cops made this place scary.

But AGCohen is also correct, its a nice place now.  The scary and noisy people have left or been evicted, and today its full of quiet foreign students and Mexican families who will turn the mariachi down if you ask.

For the record, Ive never had my car broken into, even when I leave it unlocked with my ipod inside.  There have been bikes stolen, but nobody seems to want my old schwinn that Ive left unlocked for 2 months now.   Users/WilliamBeamish

20101216 22:43:33 nbsp My boyfriend and I have lived here for two years. It is for the most part, super.  Wally Chan really is the coolest landlord ever.  Every time we have needed a repair or brought a problem to him, it has been addressed promptly.  Our neighbors are kind and rational immigrants, and are not unreasonably loud. There has been a small problem with theft from in front of our house, they have taken a chair, a small BBQ, and some ashtrays.  We are right across the street from mediocre dim sum, the symposium restaurant, the dollar tree, and a rad thrift store called all things right and relevant.  If you lived here, you would probably really happy. Also, we pay some of the cheapest rent in Davis... Users/mollyringwald
