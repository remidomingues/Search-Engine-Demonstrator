 History 

Chi Omega was founded April 5, 1895 at the University of Arkansas by Dr. Charles Richardson (an initiate of Kappa Sigma Fraternity), Ina Mae Boles, Jean Vincenheller, Jobelle Holcombe, and Alice Simonds. In 1915, Chi Omega established its executive headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky, pioneering the use of office space among all national womens fraternities, before moving to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1926. Since 1995, the Fraternitys executive headquarters has been situated on 1.5 acres (6,100 m2) in Memphis, Tennessee. The Fraternitys colors are cardinal and straw, the flower is the white carnation, and the mascot is the owl. Other symbols include the skull and crossbones.
Chi Omega made the MakeaWish Foundation its official philanthropy in 2000.

 Chi Omega Symphony 

To live constantly above snobbery of word or deed; to place scholarship before social obligations and character before appearances; to be, in the best sense, democratic rather than exclusive and lovable rather than popular; to work earnestly, to speak kindly, to act sincerely, to choose thoughtfully that course which occasion and conscience demand; to be womanly always; to be discouraged never; in a word, to be loyal under any and all circumstances to my Fraternity and her highest teachings and to have her welfare ever at heart that she may be a symphony of high purpose and helpfulness in which there is no discordant note.

 Purposes 

In 1895, the six purposes of Chi Omega were established in order to preserve and enhance the values of each member. The six purposes are friendship, high standards of personnel, sincere learning and creditable scholarship, participation in campus activities, career and personal development, and community service.
