The local Sigma Delta Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity is part of the nations oldest national Fraternities fraternity  it was founded in 1824. On the UC Davis campus since May 31, 1969, the members of the http://www.ucdchiphi.com Sigma Delta Chapter of the http://www.chiphi.org Chi Phi Fraternity  Chi Phis  are involved in many facets of campus life, from community service organizations to academic honorary societies.

Chi Phi is a member of the UC Davis IFC.

A little known fact is that Chi Phi unintentionally gave birth to Sigma Phi Epsilon when it was founded by a former Chi Phi in the fall of 1901.

Since 1969, the brothers of the Sigma Delta chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity have lived in Davis, CA on the values of Truth, Honor, and Personal Integrity. Located accross the street from the University of California, Davis, the brothers demonstrate a steadfast dedication to academic achievement, community involvement and participation in the Greek community. As soon as new members join, they are exposed to a group of dedicated men that form lifelong friendships and bonds. Dedication to the groups success ensures that all brothers are built into better men in every regard. As one of the few fraternites on campus that owns their own house, we cherrish and protect our chapter house and hold most events on location. The house cultvates a very busy and high energy culture that is always changing, depending on who lives in. The one thing that never changes is the buzz of activty surrounding busy young men as they pursue their passions. After graduating, brothers find themselves in the extensive, nationwide alumni network, which brings indvidual success in the form of internships or jobs that other graduating seniors do not have access to.

Chocolate for a Cure

During the Winter quarter, we get to work in the kitchen and bring to life an Allyoucaneat Dessert Buffet!  Our Chapter house is transformed into a gallery of sweets for everyone to pig out and satisfy their sweet tooth.  Chocolate fountains, chocolate cake, cookies, brownies.. you name it!  Its all there and for the dessert lover, our event is a must. All ticket sales go to the Boys and Girls Club of America.

Friends of the Library

The Brothers at Chi Phi put in time to help out at the local Davis library once a quarter at the very least.  This is one of  our chances to lend a hand to the community.  We head over and spend part of the evening helping out the library, making sure a hot shipment of books and materials are ready for the general public the next day.

Sausage Fest

A time to pig out on, you guessed it, hot dogs and sausages!  All proceeds go the American Cancer Society.
