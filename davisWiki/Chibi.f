Dear Readers who stumble across my page,

Today is November 21st and I just wanted to say that my heart is saddened by the events from Occupy Davis.

My youngest brother is applying to colleges and I want to tell him not to apply to Davis anymore because of the recent goingons.  But hopefully things can only improve from here.

Backstory

In case you didnt get the memo, Chibi now resides in San Jose, CA doing winerelated work.  She lives with Users/StewartShearer of the former Psi Phi organization.  She formerly lived in San Francisco and worked at Maido (then called Kinokunya Stationary and Gifts) in Japantown where she became a pen nerd.

After graduation, Chibi worked at Crepe House Uni until they closed.  After that, she worked Wednesday Farmers Market for Monticello Bistro.  She also helped them out for catering events and helped to set up their new restaurant, Monticello Seasonal Cuisine.

Chibi graduated from UCDavis in 2009 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences, with an emphasis in Microbiology and a focus on biotechnology.  She is also interested in Microbial Food Science, taking Food Science courses when she can.  Her last UCDavis course was a Study Abroad course on viticulture (VEN3) in France!  She also minored in English.

Chibi is Brazilian, Chinese, and Japanese.  Her former residence is the Casa de Cosplay.

Chibi means small/ short. She first gained the nickname because in high school, she had a senior friend named Stephanie, whose nickname was Zahni.  To avoid confusion, people called her Chibi Zahni, or Chibi Zee.  Now she goes by just Chibi.  Although it does help that she is small, her nickname did not originate from her height.

You can find her at http://ucdavis.facebook.com/profile.php?id3205536 facebook and join http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2221465541 her fanclub too!  She does cosplay and was in the Cirque du Perdue Changeling & Gates of Gold Mage LARP Larps.

Chibi has retired from being mascot of the Davis Anime Club.

Her title as mascot for DRAGON still stands, as she still has not passed on her crown.



As describled by Users/WilliamLewis Chibi is awesome!

20070510 16:39:19 nbsp This young lady is the sex. Really.  She has her own fanclub.  And she deserves it.  Users/BreeButler

20070510 08:39:15 nbsp Do you do chibi art at all? Users/StevenDaubert

20070509 22:31:14 nbsp Maybe? You must come with us on Saturday! Users/WilliamLewis


20080904 15:09:22 nbsp Hey, Id love to agree re: cosplay, but during the mid to late 1990s the term cosplay utterly took over for all fandom masquerade and costuming.  Ive always loathed the generalization of the term (it really watered down the original roots of the term, and I lament the shrinking usage of fandom terms with their own history), but it is now in general use among fandom and the original terms it has replaced are dwindling.  Id love to fight against that, but the general realworld usage among, say, Ghostbuster cosplayers or Klingon groups is to use cosplay, and it pops up in SF cons all the time as a general replacement for the older costuming terms.  (Of course, costuming somewhat replaced masquerade during the 1980s, so its an old old cycle).  Nowadays the term has a larger meaning that applies to different groups, which is why I expanded the scope of the intro  people coming to the entry will be arriving from different perspectives.

20081219 00:45:29 nbsp Hey, I missed the meeting tonight so I dont know the details for this trip to SF on Saturday, but Id like to go and can drive with room for one person if that would be helpful. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081219 10:05:11 nbsp Hey, you might want to make the lolita entry more relevant to Davis.  Where (relevant to Davis) lolifashion is worn, clubs, etc. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090208 23:02:26 nbsp Very nice. I http://www.schmalenberger.us/images/s73003584.smaller.jpg enjoyed going to Woodland yesterday also. Im planning on going to Japantown next month too, hope to see you. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090417 21:31:49 nbsp Arent they just moving? Users/JasonAller

20090521 12:58:21 nbsp You really should put up a pic of yourself. I usually dont suggest this, but I THINK Ive seen you @ Dragon, but Im not sure... Users/MasonMurray

20101022 21:18:32 nbsp Kevin says hi! Users/TomGarberson

20101023 16:34:27 nbsp Hey, I hope you dont mind, but I dotted your stats.  (Actually, I hope you like it  I thought the idea of a character sheet for a profile was nifty, so this is my way of trying to help with the cool idea). If you want to go back to the way it was, you can always revert the changes.  If you have any questions as to how, just ask, and Ill help you.  Im assuming thats nWoD, in which case, I cant remember if languages is a dot per language, or doubles with each dot.  I remember they changed it, but I cant recall if it was just made a merit or if the perlevel languages was altered as well. Users/JabberWokky

20110131 06:30:42 nbsp No problem, and Im really glad you like them!  We moved fairly recently, and have had serious problems with gamers in Nashville being flakes.  Lots of oddball cancellations, etc.  Were literally across from an under construction park with cool little ponds and tiny bridges, etc., which is right between two universities (Vanderbilt and Belmont)... ideal LARPing space.  As soon as they finish building it and the weather warms up, were going to try and start a local game. Users/JabberWokky
