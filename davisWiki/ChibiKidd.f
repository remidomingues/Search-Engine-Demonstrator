Name: Tracey
Also: Traceian, Marcus Ulpius Traianus
Size: 4 9 1/2 Call her short and die.
Age: She is immortal, so this thing called age is not relevant. However, most people mistake her for a 10yearold. Or sometimes an 8yearold boywhich makes it difficult to pass as a Pokemon trainer.
Race: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinigami Shinigami
Sightings: ChibiKidd may be spotted sporting a Team Rocket uniform or Jurassic Park rangers vest. She enjoys cosplay, which may make it difficult for you to find her. Just go around campus to all the pianos or, better yet, attend http://daviswiki.org/Classical_Studies_Association CSA meetings.
Random factoid: She likes hats. And trading cards. And plushies. And pianos. Especially pianos.

ChibiKidd also believes in the existence of a dragon who lives underground, just outside Olson Hall, and protects the UC Davis campus. If you see steam coming up from grates on your way to Olson, be sure to say hello to Eustace.
