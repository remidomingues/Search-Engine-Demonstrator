Located on the corner of Sutter and Riley in Old Folsom, this place rivals Zacharys Pizza for good Chicago Style Pizza.

This place not only serves Stuffed Crust AND Deep Dish Pizza, but also has Chicago style thin crust (really thin crispy crust) as well as great salads.

The prices are a little higher, but you burn less gas getting to Folsom than to Berkeley.  The seating in more spacious as well.  There are sizable waits on Friday and Saturday nights, but the rest of the time you can get seated quickly.  Parking right near the Folsom restaurant can be rough because it is in old Folsom, and it shares a tiny parking lot with The Powerhouse Pub, but you can easily find a parking space within a few blocks.

Directions:  Hwy 50 to Folsom Blvd. Exit.  Go west into old Folsom.  Exit right on Sutter St. contiune through the 1st stop light to 614 Sutter St.

If you dont want to trek out to Folsom, they will be opening a location in Midtown Sacramento Midtown this summer.
