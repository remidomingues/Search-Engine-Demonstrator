wiki:WikiPedia:Chicago_Style_Pizza Chicago Style Pizza was first created at http://www.pizzeriauno.com Pizzeria Uno by Ike Sewell in 1943.  The idea was to create a pizza that was a whole meal.  The pizza is heavy, thick and typically eaten with a knife and fork.

Chicago Style Pizza has several variations.

 Deep Dish: Baked in a 23 inch deep pan, it consists of a crust, cheese, topping, and a thick layer of tomato sauce.
 Stuffed Pizza: Similar to deep dish, but with an additional thin layer of crust set on top of the toppings and then covered by another layer of sauce.
 Thin Crust: Thin crispy crust with a little bit of sauce a fair amount of cheese and toppings.  It is typically cut into squares rather than wedges.

There are no restaurants in Davis but there are a few in nearby cities:
  The most famous purveyor on the West Coast is Zacharys Pizza in the Bay Area.
  If you dont want to drive that far, there is Chicago Fire Restaurant in Midtown Sacramento and Folsom which is only a few years old, and hasnt had the time to develop as much of a following but is a close second or comparable depending on who you talk to.
  If you are really desperate and cant make it out to Folsom, you can hit Zeldas Original Gourmet Pizza in Midtown Sacramento, but it is probably the least of the three.
  BJs Restaurant and Brewery located in Vacaville does not seem to specialize in Chicagostyle pizza, but it is on the menu. There is also a BJs in Folsom as well.  It has more similarities with Pizza Hut Pan Pizza that its chicago brethren, but it is tasty and reasonably priced.
  I am not really a pizza snob, but Id say BJs definitely specializes specifically in Chicago style.  It was my favorite place to get pizza when I lived in San Diego and Im thrilled its finally up here.  At the very least its awesome  and the closest to Davis.  Plus you can get a pizookie for dessert and no other pizza place can top that!

There are also places that claim to have Chicago Style Pizza, but are not.  Papa Murphys claims to have a Chicago Style Stuffed Pizza, but lacking the deep dish needed to cook it and hold in all the ingredients, it falls a bit short.

Frozen Unos pizza is also available at supermarkets.


 Patxis Chicago Style Pizza in SF is pretty good.  I went there for dinner last night.  Their deep dish pizzas are INTENSE.  Its on Hayes, about three blocks west of Van Hess.  Try it next time you are over there.  Users/JulienBiewerElstob Julien

what does this have to do with Davis?

People in Davis eat it, there may be a few displaced Davis Midwest Connection Midwesterners in Davis looking for it.  That is why I created this page originally.  Just because it isnt in Davis proper does not mean it shouldnt be here. If you notice, all there are a LOT of pages related to things outside of Davis, but are part of the Davis experience.  Users/RogerClark

I hear what youre saying, but according to the information above theres nowhere in Davis to get it. It seems like a food list page with Chicago Style Pizza on it and an outgoing sacwiki link might be more appropriate. This page says nothing other than youre SOL, which makes it seem silly to have a dedicated page to it. Users/DomenicSantangelo

Theres lots of silly pages here, that what makes it fun, that and there is no Sacwiki to link to. It is more than just what is physically in Davis it is from a Davis perspective.  If you live in Davis and want something specific (i.e. Chicago Style Pizza), it may not be in town, but at least you know where you can find it.  It could probably be integrated into another page, but it isnt doing any harm by being here.  Users/RogerClark

The fact of absence is a useful fact when looking for something.  It is certainly different than absence of fact, as it would be if this page were deleted.  Im not saying that there should be pages that say Polar Bears  none in Davis, but there are enough pizza joints to warrant a search for a Chicago style pizza.  This page provides the answer to that search  there aint no sich beast in the area.   Users/JabberWokky
   Also, Zeldas is only 15 miles from Davis... a distance someone could even bike if desperate enough.  This page definitely provides useful info to Davis residents. Users/JevanGray Jevan

Theres a Chicago Style pizza place opening up in Vacaville. Its call BJs, does any know of this place? Does it have a reputation already? Users/MichelleAccurso
   BJs Restaurant and Brewery BJs is apparently a mostly west coast chain.  I havent been to one so I have no clue, but the site makes it look more like a TGI Chilibees sorta place that happens to have their interpretation of Chicago Style Pizza.  I will hold off completely judging it until I try one out, but initial impressions are not good. Users/RogerClark Chicago Style Pizza Snob
    Ok, I have tried it and I would go there for nonpizza related fare, but it is a rather good Pan Pizza. Users/RogerClark Chicago Style Pizza Snob

Papa Murphys Chicago Style pie, as mentioned above, is very good value, and pretty tasty. Im not sure what the original comment referred to, as the pie comes in its own baking pan, which browns the bottom nicely and contains all the ingredients just fine. I think it is the only Chicago Style pizza available in Davis.  Users/ChrisLambertus

As a native Chicagoan, Ive been quite pleased with Chicago Fire. Their stuffed pizza is excellent and authentic, and even better, their thin crust is the cutintosquares stuff that used to be the only delivery option on the South Side. The only issue is that they tend to get very crowded on weekends. Between the wait for a table and the wait (~40 minutes) for a stuffed pizza, its not the place to go if you want a quick meal.  Users/nmwallace

As a displaced Midwesterner, I am glad for this page, because I want to know where I can get good Chicago pizza without the $300 round trip! Users/deeray82
