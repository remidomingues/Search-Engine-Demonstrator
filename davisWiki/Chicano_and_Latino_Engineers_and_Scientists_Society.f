Goals

Provide academic and moral support for our members.

We achieve this through many social activities, arranging study groups, and providing exam files for different science and engineering courses. Having a couple of friends that are going through the same experience really helps.

Establish and Promote an industry network.

CALESS is the perfect means to establish connections with industry. This often leads to internships, coops, and permanent employment with hightech corporations such as HewlettPackard, Dow Chemical and IBM.

Establish and promote a scholarship network.

Members of CALESS are given uptodate information on many scholarships for engineering, science, and Chicano/Latino students. There are also scholarships given by the organization to members based on merit and financial need.

Establish outreach and enrichment programs for the community.

This encompasses tutoring, mentoring and recruitment of high school students for the benefit of advancing Chicano/Latinos to higher education.

Leadership and personal development.

Members can develop leadership skills by getting involved in one of the many committees under CALESS. Industry is looking for leaders that have strong communication and personal skills. CALESS helps you develop those skills.

Enhance members transition into Corporate America.

CALESS can ease the transition into professional careers by attending SHPE & MAES regional and national conferences, workshops, and retreats.

Encourage members to pursue graduate study.

We keep close connections with the Minority Opportunities for Research in Engineering and Graduate Studies to explore opportunities for our members to attend graduate school.
