Chickens can be found throughout Davis; a lot of people keep them in their backyards. There used to be a chicken running around loose in the 7th & F Street area, but she may have been hit by a car, eaten, or recaptured, as she hasnt made an appearance since September 2004. Two roosters have been spotted multiple times during 2006 and 2007 wandering in front of the Bargain Barn and Fleet Services. A growing flock makes its home where  Solano Park meets the Arboretum. There is a hen that hangs around the courtyard of Everson Hall; apparently she has lived there for years.

It is Davis Municipal Code/5.01.020 legal to keep up to six hens on private property in Davis. However, roosters are illegal in Davis illegal for noise issues. The Domes has a chicken named Chamomile. http://www.higbyfeed.com/ Higbys in Dixon sells chicks in the spring/summer for about $2 each.  They order from Ideal Poultry, and will special order any breed Ideal sells (no minimum) for you when they place their weekly orders.

If you have the unfortunate experience of a backyard chicken dying, the http://www.cahfs.ucdavis.edu/services/lab_locations.cfm California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System at UC Davis will perform a necropsy of the bird free of charge.

The Experimental College Community Garden encourages gardeners to keep chickens at the garden. The birds are cooped and cared for privately in individual gardeners plots, and theres considerable oversight, but more than a few EC Gardeners have kept flocks successfully, beginning in late 2006. Sometimes the birds are ranged on weed control projects. Most recently, an EC Gardener constructed small chicken tractors for use in a Bermuda grass eradication project at the garden. Check out the EC Gardens Wiki page and read the Small Fowl and Rabbits clause in the contract, then mailto:ecgarden@ucdavis.edu email the Coordinator to schedule a tour today.

UC Davis Genetics Geneticists recently http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7221 sequenced the chicken genome.  UC Davis has an Avian Sciences program.

If you have an exceptional love of chickens, bicycling, or both you can participate in the Tour de Cluck!

If you really need a chicken fix of another sort, you can find tasty examples at various restaurants around town, including KFC. An alternative to chicken is vegetarian options tofu or wiki:wikipedia:Quorn Quorn nuggets.

 Somewhat Interesting Chicken Factoids 

 Fair Oaks, California, has had freeroaming chickens in its old city center for decades. Old Fair Oaks Village, a small town near Sunrise Bridge spanning the American River, has even been immortalized for its chicken fetish in a song. Slocum House, a restaurant inside the village, is famous for its little chickens running around on the patio where you eat.

 Chickens apparently dont necessarily need a head to survive... Fruita, Colorado was home to http://www.miketheheadlesschicken.org/ Mike the Headless Chicken, whose image is enshrined in a large statue in the town square. Poor Mike was going to be dinner, but Farmer Olsen cut off his head just above the brain stem and the hatchet just missed his jugular  Mike lived for 18 months beyond dinner and was fed by the guiltridden, but suddenly famous farmer using a dropper.
   sorry, I dont buy that. A chicken most assuredly needs a head.  Users/EfremRensi

 PBS produced a hugely entertaining video all about chickens called http://www.shoppbs.org/smpbsnaturalhistoryofthechickenpi1428832.html The Natural History of the Chicken. The piece doesnt take any political stances, but addresses amazing chickens, chicken production, crazy chicken people, and even raising fighting cocks (no jokes!). Oh, Mikes in the video as well.

 The State of California maintains sentinel flocks of chickens throughout the state as an early warning system for http://daviswiki.org/Sacramento%2dYolo_Mosquito_and_Vector_Control_District vectorborne disease outbreaks.

20090906 15:19:34 nbsp Anyone know whose chickens are running around 5th and F? Theres a mom and three chicks. Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20090907 11:58:33 nbsp My husband almost got hit by a bus trying to avoid that chicken while biking and when my mom came to visit, she was just amazed that chickens wandered around the city. 5th and F chicken you are my favorite. Users/EricaMacGregor

20100213 22:40:55 nbsp I think that flock by Solano Park and the Arboretum came from the farm land on the other side of the tracks. Theyre cagey little fowl, and totally safe in a thick web of bushes. Curiously quiet too. That was in mid2008. Users/TimQuick

20110605 10:35:27 nbsp I loved having chickens; theyre such cool little animals and so friendly if you handraise them correctly. However, to those of you in the city of Davis that have noisy ones  PLEASE have a little respect for your neighbors who might work odd hours in the medical field and get rid of them!! Not all the chickens, just the ones that cluck nonstop for 23 hours early in the morning. There are always people living out of town who are willing to take them. Users/mooodavis
