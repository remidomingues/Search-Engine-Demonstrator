Types of Child Care

There are a number of options for child care in Davis:

   Traditional daycare and preschool centers
   Daycare providers who operate from their own homes
   Nannies/babysitters who operate from your home
   The UC Davis Center for Child & Family Study (CCFS)
   Hutchison Child Development Center on campus.

  Note: Preschools provide an educational environment for part of the day to children usually around 36 years old; daycare providers offer care for part or all of the day to children with ages spanning three months old to six years old.

Trivia
  It was only a few years ago that UC Davis began providing oncampus childcare, making it the last of the UCs to implement this program.



Am I to understand from this page that anybody can just run a daycare out of their home? Shouldnt that require the permission of the neighbors?
