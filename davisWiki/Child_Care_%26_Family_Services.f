UC Davis is committed to quality child care and family services through:
     Information and referrals;
     Support of universityoperated, cooperative, and privatelyowned programs on campus;
     Collaboration with the City of Davis and the Davis Joint Unified School District.

We recognize the importance of accessible and affordable child care and family services in attracting a diverse population of students and employees, reducing stress and absenteeism, and increasing retention. We hope this website will assist you in making informed decisions and balancing school, work and parenting.

Their website provides you with information on a wide array of services, resources, and programs available on campus and in the community. If you wish to receive a program directory or a program bulletin, please email us (Mailto(childcare AT ucdavis DOT edu)) with your postal address.

For assistance with other aspects of Work Life integration, the http://www.hr.ucdavis.edu/Work_Life Staff Work Life Program offers information and services regarding alternate work arrangements, elder care, learning and development, wellness and volunteer opportunities.
