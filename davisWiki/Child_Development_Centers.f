Monday through Friday before and after school programs for kindergarten through 6th grade children.

Provides tutoring, homework help, childcare, and nutritious wellbalanced snacks/meals etc. for children enrolled in the Child Development programs at these locations:
  Birch Lane School Birch Lane CDC 7587251
  Cesar Chavez Elementary School Cesar Chavez CDC 7533808
  Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School Montgomery CDC 2975014

  Pioneer School Pioneer CDC 7580611
  Willett Elementary School Willett CDC 7588342
  Korematsu Elementary School Korematsu CDC 7539223
Note: some locations offer school readiness/preschool programs (Cesar Chavez, Montegomery, and Patwin).

During summer months, they also serve as an alternative to the City of Davis recreation programs. Participants get to go on field trips to places like Chuck E Cheeses (at least when I was a part of it) and weekly visits to the pool. The only difference between the City recreation programs being that a lot of the CDC activities happen indoors. Something to take into consideration.
