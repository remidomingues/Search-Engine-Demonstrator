The Chili Cookoff is a fundraising event for the Davis Joint Unified School District as part of the DollaraDay Campaign, organized by the Davis Schools Foundation.  It will be hosted Saturday, May 1, 2010 by Westlake Market in Westlake Plaza.

The Chili Cookoff activities will run from noon to 4 p.m. Judging will be done by our local celebrities and a Davis Chili Champion will be determined. In addition to chili tasting, other foods — barbecued tritip, chicken and ribs — and beverages including Sudwerk beer and soda will be sold at the festivities. Activities for children are planned, and there will be live music.

  Not willing to travel for your chili, eh?  I suspect that Westlake IGA was the one who stepped up to suggest, host, and organize the event.  cp
