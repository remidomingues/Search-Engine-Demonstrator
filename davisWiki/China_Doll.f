20080121 16:09:53 nbsp Id say pretty good for heating bin food. Unfortunately, I didnt learn about the lamb until after I started eating. Some of the heating bin food seemed to be at an ambient temperature, but i didnt get sick, so im not complaining. EDIT just had the lamb dish and its great, just the right amount of spice, with a slight sweetness. Its cooked with big hunks of mushroom, sliced zucchini, and bell peppers Users/MattHh

20080629 16:03:26 nbsp So when you say heating bin do you mean steam table? Users/JimStewart
 probably, heating bin is a more general term, ie. a steam table is a heating bin but not all heating bins are steam tables. Users/MattHh
