CDAC is no longer active. The Chinese Dance club has been restarted in Fall 2012 under the name http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Chinese_Dance Davis Chinese Dance. Visit us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/groups/davischinesedance/.


The Chinese Dance and Arts Club or CDAC was founded in 2006 by a couple of UC Davis students who wanted to share their passion for performing and Chinese dancing with their peers. The mission of our club was to promote the beautiful art that is Chinese dance and break any stereotypes that are associated with it. Each year CDAC members learned various dances of various ethnic styles in China from the popular style of the Han ethnicity to the unique style of the Xinjiang (Uhgyr) minority. Members in the club not only learned about Chinese dance, but they also developed lasting friendships with each other. All of our dance instructors have a strong background in Chinese dancing who are more than willing to share their talents with our members. Anybody with an interest in Chinese dance and culture was encouraged to join our club whether they had years of experience or none.

CDAC had its last year at UC Davis in 20092010. Unfortunately, there was nobody left at UCD with a passion for Chinese Dance like the girls who graduated in 2010. We had a great last year though. Even through the hardships we faced, we managed to pull together an awesome dance piece and took 2nd place at UCDs annual dance competition, Davis Dance Revolution (DDR). CDAC performed on stage for the very last time at our very successful end of the year show on May 23rd, 2010 called Rhythm of the EastThe Finale. You can watch dances from the entire showcase here: http://www.youtube.com/ucdcdac

20081119 05:26:14 nbsp Is the club open to the public, just for UC Davis students or just for UC Davis undergraduate students? Users/JabberWokky

20090205 15:00:47 nbsp Hey jabberwokky, this club is open to all ucd students. Our meetings are usually in the ARC pavillion, so it would be difficult to have a nonucd student join for the same monetary investment Users/jfong252
