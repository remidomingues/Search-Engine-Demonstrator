There are Plethora vs. Dearth in Davis many restaurants labeled as Chinese in Davis. Even some of the other forms of Asian restaurants tack on And Chinese Food somewhere on their signs. They are almost always referring to an Americanized version of Chinese food, which can be entirely different.  Its just kind of its own thing. Hunan and Silver Dragon are usually suggested as restaurants that do a good job straddling the line between Asian influence and AngloAmerican taste buds. Davis Chinese restaurants are quite a good deal at lunch time, but rice may cost a buck or two extra if you dont get a lunch special.  Shanghai Town and Hometown Chinese Food, followed by the Old Teahouse and maybe Davis Noodle City, are often considered the most authentic and unique to true Chinese food.  Shanghai Town is the only restaurant in Davis that offers dim sum. The Dumpling House offers Chinese dumplings.

Historically, there is great variance in cooking styles and taste preferences throughout Chinesespeaking lands. Therefore, Chinese restaurants often highlight the regional origin of a dish through naming conventions, and the more authentic restaurants tend to specialize in a particular regions cuisine overall. For example, despite some similarities, Old Teahouse would be considered predominantly Taiwanese Cuisine Taiwanese, whereas Quickly is more oriented towards the style of Hong Kong Cuisine Hong Kong. Hometown Chinese Food specializes in Taiwanese cuisine. Shanghai Town emphasizes the culinary heritage of the Shanghai Cuisine Shanghai area.

Even heavily Americanized dishes usually exhibit at least some basis of a traditional Chinese food culture. For example, the widelyavailable Kung Pao chicken and twicecooked pork are loosely based on the more authentic Szechuan Cuisine Szechuan originals of the Szechuan province. Also, dishes with Mandarin in the title are generally associated with the Beijing Cuisine Beijing area.

 Commentary 
The sad thing is that arguably the most authentic Chinese food in Davis can be gotten at Old Teahouse, in terms of selection and serving food without sweet sauces, although this says little about quality there (which is uneven). For those who truly love authentic Chinese cuisine, its hard to do much better than New Canton. Its Chinese name is something like Tailwind, just to be random, and it is located on Broadway & 26th in Sacramento. Chef Tony Su used to be Executive Chef at ABC in Milpitas, which is the best Chinese restaurant in the Northern California (sharing this honor also with Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae).

20041116 00:44:57 nbsp Hong Kong Flower Lounge is pretty impressive.  The lobster and crab were excellent, but the lemon chicken and the rice were pretty bad.  Users/MikeIvanov

20041116 01:20:29 nbsp Even the best restaurants have their unfortunate moments.  Bad rice?  wow.  Users/JaimeRaba

20041129 20:26:02 nbsp How is it possible for a chinese restaurant to screw up rice?!?  They use giant rice cookers, not bamboo stalks!  Users/MarieHuynh

20061029 01:13:55 nbsp go to sacramento for decent chinese food Users/PatrickSing

20070602 18:26:17 nbsp I think Davis may have the highest Chinese restaurant to population ratio in California.  Its absurd. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070923 18:36:54 nbsp Ahh.. I would say the most authentic Chinese is Shanghai Town.   Cant argue that New Canton is probably the best in SacTown. Users/atwong

20100126 16:51:00 nbsp New Canton has really fallen off in the last few years IMO.  For Dim Sum in Sac, I highly recommend the Rice Bowl now. Users/rfrazier

20100207 13:45:00 nbsp My favorite Chinese food in Davis can be had at either Davis Noodle City or Red Orchid Restaurant (same owners).  I love their homemade noodles.  I dream about their homemade noodles, especially paired with szechuan eggplant.  Yum.  A close second is Wok of Flame, where the ingredients are always high quality and the sauces tasty.
