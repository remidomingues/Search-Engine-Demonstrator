As of Spring 2009, a new Chinese language based playgroup is being launched for the Davisarea community.  Parents can bring their young infants, toddlers, and children together and be exposed to Mandarin Chinese in a lowstress, immersive environment.  We are just getting started and would like to see if there is any interest in this in the Davis community.

Frequently Asked Questions
  Whos welcome?  Families of all ethnic and language background are welcome.  Although some of the children will come from Chinesespeaking backgrounds, many others will not.

  Why Chinese?  Mandarin Chinese is used by 1.3 billion+ Chinese throughout Greater China (PRC, Taiwan, Singapore...).  China claims a continuous cultural heritage of more than 5000 years, a cultural heritage which is closely tied to the Chinese language. China will become the worlds second largest economy in 2009, and may even pass the United States to become the largest economy in the world within the next 30 years... just as our toddlers reach adulthood.  Even basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese will add a whole new dimension to the lives of our children.

  Why should we start teaching our kids so young?  Mandarin Chinese can be a difficult language to learn.  The same syllable can mean completely different things depending on the tone used; there are four distinct tones.  For example, take the syllable ba.  If spoken flatly, it can mean the number eight.  If spoken in a rising tone (as if asking a question), it can mean pull out... and so on.  Some have described the language as being sung.  It can be very difficult for an adult (or even teenage) learner to memorize all of these tones accurately.  On the other hands, for young children, theres no memorization at all.  Theyll learn all of these tones intuitively, just by being exposed as a child.

  What will you be teaching?  Were not teachers, so were not planning to teach anything... just provide another opportunity for our kids to play.  For young children, the priority will be hearing/speaking informally in Mandarin Chinese, rather than learning to read/write.  For those interested, there are also Chinese books/DVDs (Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Baby Einstein, Teletubbies) that can be shared.

  How much will this cost?  Nothing.  Its just a playgroup! Although perhaps we will rotate on providing refreshments.

If you have a little one at home and would be interested in practicing Chinese with us, please email the group: chineseplaygroup at googlegroups.com

PS. There are also excellent Schools Chinese schools available in Davis (typically for kids 5 and older).

20110323 15:19:31 nbsp Hi all... Im one of the founding parents for the group.  We havent really done anything structured in the last year or so, but anyone interested... feel free to email the address above.  chineseplaygroup@googlegroups.com .  Were still watching the list, and are happy to meet up for play time!  We are still close friends with some of the families we met.  Several of our kids are also attending the same bilingual + Chineseimmersion preschool in Davis.

Maybe we should setup a Beijing Corner for kids to speak Chinese on a regular basis... Wednesday night farmers market, for example? Users/ChonT

20110405 16:59:23 nbsp Hi, ChonT, Could you give me some ideas of the age of the kids in the group, the meeting location
and time, and any contact person? I tried to email to your Google group address but it bounced back. Thanks. Users/HsinyaYang

20110621 10:45:20 nbsp Can someone also send me information about this playgroup?  The gmail address is bouncing back.  If its no longer going on, is there another going on, or is there interest in forming another one? Users/Tiffany2

20120120 12:38:13 nbsp Hi guys,

Apologies!  The mailing list was always active (and we were watching it)... but there was an extra period at the end of the address on this page.  That must be why it bounced... sorry again for the inconvenience.  Please try mailing the list again with your questions.  You can also find the group this way:  http://groups.google.com/group/chineseplaygroup Users/ChonT
