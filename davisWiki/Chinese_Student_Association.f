The Chinese Student Association (CSA) is a registered Student Organizations student organization with emphasis on promoting Chinese culture here at UC Davis. Our goal is to also help students enjoy life in between their busy student lifestyle and at the same time give them an opportunity to learn more about Chinese culture. Through our many events, members are able to take a break from their busy student life and build bonding relationships among members. In addition, we have partnered with businesses throughout the Northern California region so that our members can receive many benefits that meet their lifestyle. CSA is a place where you can meet new friends, hang out, and have fun. No matter what language you speak and where you are from, we encourage you to join our family.
