I amn sorry for not returning your call anytime you may have tried ,but did not mean anything by it. Sometimes I just get so overwhelmed with calls that I dont get to return calls always on time. I am also a full  time student. The best way to reach me I tell most people is to call and email because I answer my email almost immediately. Good luck and email me next time for a prompt response. I am sure you would be very happy with my services once you have tried them

20071216 21:33:12 nbsp Did you (JasonAller) create the page for me??  Are you part of the wiki team?  I once screwed up and deleted a page on wiki, and i asked for help, and someone put it back up right away.  since then i have been wondering who is doing all that maintenance work... Users/ChingChing
   We all are  the entire wiki is composed of people exactly like you (and in fact, you are part of the wiki team just as much as Jason or I).  Every editor (including you) is equally capable of editing anything on the wiki, and we all edit the wiki together as a shared resource.  Jasons one of the most active editors, and you can see his work all over the wiki, along with the collective work of thousands of other people.  The ones who do the boring necessary work tend to be called gnomes, but its merely a nickname... you can call yourself a gnome, and if you start helping out (you dont have to ask anyone!), people might start calling you a gnome.  The entire wiki is basically a pure volunteer system with nobody in charge of content, and everybody has an opportunity to help or weigh in on editorial decisions. Welcome to the wiki!

20080224 17:29:57 nbsp Just like any community, there are some people who are heavily involved and some who just do minor work.  I tend to try to read through all of the changes and keep an eye on every change... Im not always able to keep up lately, but I do my best.  There are enough other people who do the same thing that we all kind of overlap.  Youll notice the same couple dozen names tend to do the minor gardening and wiki care stuff, which is generally referred to as gnoming.  Were all just volunteers the same as you. Users/JabberWokky
