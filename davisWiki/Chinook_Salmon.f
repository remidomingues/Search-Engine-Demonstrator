Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were once a numerous anadromous fish that inhabited Putah and Cache Creek. Their disappearance during the middle of the century owed much to damming projects and water diversions. Over the last two decades, Chinook salmon have been making their way up Putah Creek and have been sighted spawning throughout the lower half of the creek. Several carcasses have also been identified on the lower part of Cache creek as well.
