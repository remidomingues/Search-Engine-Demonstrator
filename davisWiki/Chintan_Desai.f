Senate Goals

Firstyear Outreach
  Establish the leadership councils currently in place in the housing areas as ASUCD advisory committees
  Work to provide senator office hours in DCs and other Student Housing areas
  Provide residents with ASUCD developed programs that RAs can utilize to educate freshmen on how to become involved
  Make it a requirement for ASUCD senators to regularly visit the dorms and give presentations

Campus Club Events
  Work with Campus Events to facilitate the process of putting on club events
  Make the eventplanning process more timeefficient, which would benefit smaller clubs with less resources
  Provide incentives for group leaders to become aware of the process of putting on events
  Establish an easy to follow online tutorial on how to put on events which would benefit any group

Athletic Events
  Make UC Davis football tickets available at Freeborn Hall, increasing the attendance for our Aggie sports teams!

Campus Entertainment
  With the ASUCD Coffee House closing for renovations next year, it is important to find new areas on campus for students to hangout between classes
  Establish the Gunrock Pub, located in the Silo Union building and currently open only during lunch hours, as such a place
  Work to make the Gunrock Pub a more studentfriendly location by expanding its hours and establishing programs where student clubs could use the facility for meetings

Parking
  Work with the TAPS advisory committee to move the free parking time from 10 PM to 9 PM on weekdays
  Continue to promote beneficial TAPS programs, such as The Comet, a payasyougo parking meter

Renters Advocacy
  Partner with Steven D. Lee, former City/County Affairs Director on ongoing projects related to renters advocacy:
  Expanding a renters education program, so that more students are knowledgeable about the complexities of renting an apartment in Davis
  Institutionalizing and regularly reviewing the Davis Model Lease, thus making it more applicable to current times which would benefit landlords and tenants
  Lobbying apartment complexes in Davis to renew leases later in the year (preferably after spring break), giving renters more flexibility in terms of planning for the next year
