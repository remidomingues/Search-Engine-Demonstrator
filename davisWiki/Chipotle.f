Chipotle (pronounced Chipotelay, they tell me) is the quintessential chain Mexican food burrito joint of Davis.  They offer burritos (with or without a tortilla  if you opt for a burritobol), fajitaclass burritos (with sauteed peppers and onions instead of beans), tacos (soft or hard) and salads. Part of their business model is to be cool. So they employ greeters to small talk with customers and allow for substitutions of ingredients.

Everything is made in front of you and allow the choice of the following ingredients:

With every burrito, you have the option of:

    Black or Pinto Beans (pinto are not vegetarian options vegetarian)
    White Rice (with lime, cilantro and salt)
    Fajita veggies (grilled green bell peppers and red onions)
    Meat (or free Guacamole if you go meatless  $5.20)
      Barbacoa (shredded beef)  $5.70
      Chicken  $5.35
      Steak  $5.50
      Carnitas (Pork)  $5.85
    Salsa
      Fresh Tomato
      Tomatillo GreenChili
      Tomatillo RedChili
      Roasted ChiliCorn
    Sour Cream
    Cheese
    Guacamole (costs an additional $1.40 or free with a veggie item)
    Romaine Lettuce
    Chips also available ($.70, $1.25 with salsa, $2.10 with Guacamole)

A soft taco order consists of three soft tacos.  Hard/crispy taco orders also give you three crispy tacos.  A taco order plays by the above rules, except that you dont get rice or beans unless you ask for them.  The salads are basically tacos minus the shell plus more lettuce.  You can also order some items from their childrens menu such as halforders and quesadillas.  If you prefer the rice over their (sometimes watery) beans, just ask for more rice and less beans.


Good value: Ask for a burrito with 1 topping (beans, rice, cheese, fajita veges, etc) and get a lot of nutrition for 70 cents.  Remember, each 12 tortilla has 340 calories, so youre probably getting about 600 calories total, with very low fat and sugar content.


Prior to September 2006, showing your Reg Card would get you a free soda.  This promotion has apparently been discontinued during the school year. At some Chipotles you can get free burritos
  On tax day by filling out a burrito EZ
  By dressing up as a burrito for halloween

McDonalds http://www.chipotlefan.com/index.php?idchipotlemcdonalds has no ownership in Chipotle anymore as of 2006, but was once (starting in 1997) a shareholder of Chipotle.  The McDonalds investment in Chipotle grew with time, peaking at 90%.  Chipotles IPO raised an estimated $1 billion for McDonaldsFootnote(Source: http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf20050923_1613_db016.htm Business Week, 20050923).

 Departure of Joe Herman 

The Davis Chipotle used to be on Facebook and usually had 2 contests per week. The Restaurateur Joe gave away a lot of certificates for free food. Once Joe parted ways with Chipotle they took away this facebook page.  The Joe Herman comments on this page describe the circumstances of Joes departure in more detail. Joe is currently running the South Davis Dos Coyotes now. It was a much better fit for him since it is locally owned and is not part of the corporate machine.

A http://www.facebook.com/pages/OperationDavisCaRetaliationHelpJoecombatchipotle/135308323199383?vwall Facebook group was created to support the former manager of Chipotle, Joe, after he left the company.

 Nutrition Information 
Chipotle has several healthy choices, but by and large, (like the vast majority of restaurants in Davis) many orders have too much saturated fat, sodium and calories for a healthy diet. (http://www.cspinet.org/new/200309301.html  Center for Science in the Public Interest). It should be noted that the ingredients used in a burrito at other local taquerias are usually worse. In addition the sodium estimates are similar to other restaurants that claim to be healthy eateries, such as Subway (see http://www.fastfoodnutrition.org/rnutritionfacts/Subwayitem.html Subway Nutrition Facts).

Using Chipotles http://www.chipotlecaloriecalculator.com:

  Chipotles Chicken Burrito: (with black beans, rice, lettuce, tomato and salsa) is 770 calories, 6 grams of saturated fat, 87% of your Daily Value of sodium, and 56% of your daily value of fiber
  Chipotles Vegetarian Burrito: (with grilled veggies, black beans, rice, lettuce, guacamole, tomato and salsa) is 750 calories, 6 grams of saturated fat,  89% of your Daily Value of sodium, and 84% of your daily value of fiber
  Chipotles Barbacoa Burrito: (with shredded beef, pinto beans, rice, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa) is 1,120 calories, 20 grams of saturated fat, 112% daily value of sodium, and 80% of your daily value of fiber.
  Chipotles Chicken Burrito Bolsburritos without the 340calorie flour tortillasare CSPIs only recommended Better Bites at Chipotle. A Bol with chicken, black beans, lettuce, and salsa, has just 430 calories and four grams of saturated fat. Rice instead of lettuce adds about 200 calories.

 Authenticity Discussion 

Back when McDonalds invested heavily in Chipotle, this added to the view that their food is less authentic than other taquerias. Mcdonalds however, was only a major shareholder and never executed any authority/management.  Note that Chipotle no longer has any affiliation with McDonalds.

They do help out KDVS every year with their fundraiser. And the food is okay. But if you use the word Mexican to describe it then you are in error. Chipotle is only half a shade browner than Taco Bell.  Users/RobRoy
      Chipotle appears to use a great deal of free range and organic products.  And while its not Baja Californiastyle, the inclusion of Carnitas and their selection of salsas convince me that its significantly more authentic than drivethru Mexican.  To be sure, its no Mexican taco shop.  (Not that any taco shops in Davis compare with those in Southern California and Baja California.  Certain Taco trucks found in Woodland and Winters are the closest thing around.) Users/JaimeRaba jr
        Two notes: 1) A friend had a relative visiting from Mexico (I think it was their mom, but I cant remember for sure), and after eating at Chipotle, they commented that the flavor of their carnitas was the closest they had tasted in the US to what they were used to at home. This isnt to say that Chipotle is really authentic food, but I think that they do get some of the details right. 2) The people who run the taco truck in Winters also own and run Chuys Taqueria Chuys in Winters, which probably has the best Mexican food Ive had in the area. They are at least as good as most places Ive been to in southern California.  Users/EricKlein
        The question What is authentic? comes to mind  Mexican food in Mexico is not only a synthesis of various cultures throughout time (various cultures rising, spreading their tastes and then falling, with Spanish being the most recent) but also a regional and even individual tradition.  Walk into any town famous for a particular type of cuisine, and you can likely find two kitchens located on the same street, each claiming to make that type of cuisine the right way.  In the end, it is not about how brown the company is (a distasteful and racist rule of thumb), but what they choose to call it.  If you think an ethnic food has to conform to some sort of rule, youre either European (who do have tasting and labeling laws) or have a very generic view of what a given ethnic food is.  Id also like to see you sit down in a Barbeque joint in South Carolina along the Georgia border and complain that the Barbeque isnt authentic because the sauce is mustard based... or complain in Santa Maria that the tangysweet salsa based Barbeque (dating to the mid1800s) isnt authentic.  Users/JabberWokky
        The quest for authentic ethnic food is a noble one in this day and age of capitalistic homogenation.  Once the corporations get ahold of a a food category, they subvert it to be as palletable (bland) as possible so people in the midwest will eat it.  Its not so much what IS authentic Mexican reasonable minds can differ as to what be representative cuisine for a particular region in, say, Mexico given the ingredients available here.  However, what is worthwhile is to point out that certain restaurants masquerade as being authentic when they in fact are not.  Taco Bellnot that anyone believes themis quite guilty of this.  Chipotle is an interesting hybrid.  On some signage they claim to be Mexican, and on others they claim Mexican influenced, which is fare more true.  Despite their McDonalds association, they seem to have some surprisingly good and authentic food in some categories. Users/JaimeRaba jr
        Authentic ethnic food is an historical laughfactory. It only takes a few decades or so for authentic to change altogether as new foods are introduced from one place to another. Do you like the taste of authentic Thai food with papaya? The papaya came from the Americas, along with potatoes, corn, and a whole host of other foods, and foods from around the world were brought here and cuisines were combined. (Where did bell peppers come from, eh?) The only thing that seems to make Thai food Thai, and Mexican food Mexican are the local herbs that are mixed into the food. Basically, if you grab whatever plants are growing in your back yard and throw them into your food, its authentic food for your locality. Authentic is nostalgia for specific cooking styles that were not culturally universal in space or time, and amounts to more a marketing gimmick than an actual description. Ill have an authentic pre1800s Hawaiian dish with the pineapple that the Europeans introduced since 1492, but without the Papaya that was introduced later, please. Thats the real authentic!  Users/KarlMogel KJM
           Word to this!  Users/KenjiYamada
           It may also be worth noting that the tomato is a New World plant as well, which means that any European dishes containing it probably arent authentic, for a given value of authentic. This is particularly evident in Italian food. Pizza, spaghetti, lasagne, and many other dishes are very much enhanced by this nonauthentic ingredient.users/JoePomidor
        I think its always important to criticize peoples individual tastes, especially when it comes to the wholly objective arena of food.  Users/jonathannasca
        It makes me laugh how people choose to focus on the impossible what is authentic question and the McDonalds connection rather than discuss the food. So much of our lives is corporate outside of food sales, it is curious to think how people can bash some corporate chains but then dont think twice about going to a corporate supermarket, a corporate bookstore, a chain coffeeshop, a corporate bank... the list goes on and on. As an employee at Chipotle, I know some of you selfrighteous ideologues sneakingly visit Chipotle with some bad excuses, so quit with the double standard. Nevertheless, I commend everybody in this discussion and I challenge everybody to scrutinize all business with the same critical eye they use to examine Chipotle. Challenges to corporate America are long overdue.  Users/ErnBro
         Well, since you asked, heres my 2 cents.  Everything is relative and needs to be taken in context. Im from the east coast where the Mexican food flat out sucks. If a Chipotle were there, Id be a regular given the large size of the burritos, the taste, and the price. I welcome Chipotles to raise the par of east coast Mexican food. However, I live in Davis, where there are numerous Mexican restaurants that have burritos for the same price, more variety of fillings, and that are larger and tastier. To boot, they also have full salsa bars and copious amounts of chips. Given that, I dont understand why anyone goes to Chipotle. Its a step down from other Mexican places with no extras to make it appealing. Im not trying to be insulting, I honestly dont see what it offers that other places dont.  Places like Taco Bell and McDonalds arent good because theyre authentic, but because they offer products you cant find at more authentic places (e.g.,  Nacho Cheese Chalupas and Chicken Nuggets). Users/CraigBrozinsky
              Well I know there has developed practically a church around Guad, and while I do like them, I think their quality (especially in terms of meat) is very uneven.  Chipotles ingredients are just better overall, and this is reflected by their use of certain freerange and organic ingredients.  Now I think the overlooked place in Davis is El Mariachi, which is quite fantastic.  But if I want a healthy meal, a Burrito bowl with lettuce on the bottom is a good way to go at Chipotle.  However, the best Burrito in Sacramento is the Regular (not super) Carne Asada Burrito at the Florin Road Adalbertacos (formerly Adalbertos).  This burrito contains only Guacamole, Salsa and Meat.  Of course, there are plenty of other places to go if you like toppings.  (Also recommended: California Burrito).

It may be appropriate to warn that Florin road isnt really a place for people to just WANDER. Its one of the ummm... SKETCHIER areas of Sac.

Hey! That guy is my psc professor! Anyway...I have to say that I have been dissapointed by the food at chipotle both times I have gone there, but then again im from a farm town north of Daviswith alarge hispanic population and I have been dissapointed by a lot of the mexican places in Davis. I havent gone to any of the Woodland places yet but Ithink I will try them. The last Time I went to Chipotle the employees were all in bad moods, and they were out of chips and took a long time to make more...there didnt seem to e anyone in charge so one person would say something and another person would say the opposite. The burritos seem to have gotten smaller too for the same price as what I paid last year for a larger burrito. I do like the fact that you can choose your salsaand your beans though.

20061213 21:14:17 nbsp If you want consistent Mexican food this is the place.  They will not wow you with their culinary creations, but if you want a big burrito for a reasonable price this is where its at.  The key to supersizing a burrito I have found is to ask for more than one kind or salsa.  Other tricks are coming in when certain workers are on the line because they will load you up!  When Im not in the mood to be adventurous I usually end up here knowing I can get good food everytime. Users/JohnHumperdinkle

20070317 20:38:30 nbsp i ended up here today for no reason other than i had a coupon for a free salad/burrito/tacos/bowls.  I was absolutely shocked that the food here was really no worse than any of the other places in Davis.  Yes the places in woodland are way better, especially El Paisano Taco Truck, but the food here is decent as compared to the places in davis.  Maybe its just because i had such low expectations, but i actually enjoyed this food, partially because it makes no claim to be authentic. Users/MattHh

20070322 13:41:36 nbsp  tastes good, but whitewashed, even the burritos are strangely white cause of the jasmine rice Users/TheStomach

20070609 22:07:29 nbsp Chipotle is pretty delicious. Its definitely americanized mexican food. Its like the subway of mexican food. All of my roommates and I go there often. One even bought a $100 gift card there. The burritos definitely fill you up. Its fast too. Users/KyleScollin

20080205 00:58:18 nbsp Everyone gripes about how many calories are in Chipotles food and how much fat... what do you expect when you get sour cream and cheese? Theyre some of the fattiest dairy products. If you get a bowl with everything except sour cream and cheese (no guac either) then its only 620650 calories and 4 or 5 grams of fat, which is kind of on the high side, but still not too bad for a whole meal. Users/HopeBravo

20080328 10:25:43 nbsp The people working there seem to have a problem counting. They have given me one less taco in my order on multiple occasions. However, if you dont mind always monitoring your food as it is being made, this is the place to go. Burrito sizes have gotten smaller on average but are surprisingly still bigger than the super at Guadalajaras and the Chips are still over salted. They no longer offer free sodas at all to University students. Overall, the quality of the ingredients used is the best of all Mexicanstyle restaurants in town.

Still the best place for Burritos and Tacos in town.  Users/senioritis

20080402 21:05:03 nbsp I fell in love with this chain when I first tried their burrito in SF. I really love how the meat is soft, but the price is a bit too high for me. The place at my home is lower and gives you tortilla chips too. Users/Aarolye

20080421 21:30:01 nbsp Im just happy there is one here. Im from Pittsburgh and the closest one to me was in ohio until recently. But who gives a crap if something is authentic. If its in Davis its obviously not authentic...because its in Davis. Do you really think alot of those poor communities in Mexico can afford that type of cheese and sour cream and rice? Just eat it. If its good its good, if its bad its bad, dont go back. If you really want Mexican food...then go to Mexico. If you want Davis food...eat in Davis. Users/patrick82

20080811 09:05:49 nbsp I wouldnt actually call this place Mexican cuisine, but they do have burritos, tacos, an d some neat offmenu items you can get if you ask about them. White rice??  Give me a break.

That aside though, this place gives you your moneys worth. Huge Burritos, or bowls depending on your taste. About $6.00 gets you a compete meal and out the door in 5 minutes or less if you get the time to go.

20081013 17:34:53 nbsp Chipotle is one of my favorite quick food restaurants. We eat their regularly in any city. Their rice and guacamole are amazing. The one in Davis has good food quality, but the service has been rude to us many times. I always get the burrito bol because you can mix it all up and eat with a fork instead of trying to keep my burrito in one piece. As long as the food is good I cant really complain ) Users/MichVan

20081122 12:02:50 nbsp Hey all!!!! My name is Joe. The Chipotle on E Street is mine. Over the next couple of weeks I am going to clear some things up here that are not true.
  The weight of the burritos has never changed
  The comment it is just a rice burrito makes no sense...Last time I checked you tell my employees what you want in the burrito, bol,etc...If you dont want rice dont get it
  We never claimed to be authentic. We are just a fresh healthy choice. I love authentic Mexican food!!! It is my favorite. Although I dont like tripe:)
  All of our meat is naturally raised..meaning..no antibiotics, no hormones, vegetarian fed, and humanely raised. We were way ahead of Prop 2
  We are not owned by McDonalds!!! We used some of their money to start up the company and that was it. We never used any of the same food vendors at anytime. We bought them out after we took off. They made a lot of money off of us. We got rid of them...For the record I think Mcdonalds is disgusting.
  Our prices are not to high if you consider both the quality and the portion.
  Inconsistent guacamole. Our guac is made fresh everyday. Produce changes from season to season. Our recipe stays the same always. The produce changes flavor and in the case of the jalapenos heat from season to season. Just keep in mind that you are always getting the freshest produce we can get.

I will follow up with some more info for you. Feel free to ask me any questions. By the way Rob Roy your half shade browner comment is disgusting. Please stop wasting tax payers money to put your name on the ballot and by all means please go eat at Taco Bell. It is apparent to me that some people are commenting on this page that have never been in my restaurant. It is kind of like the kids that post negative comments on ITunes when they dont even purchase the music or application. We work very hard to make the freshest ingredients for our guests every day. Everything you see on the line was made that day.

I just want to say thank you to all of our guests that come in everyday. A lot of you have become like family to me. I feel very blessed to be in Davis because we have such a large demographic of different cultures here. It is great to meet people from all over the world.

Finally to the haters and the bashers Taco Bell is 2 streets over..PLEASE GO THERE....go knock yourself out!!! I have 700 people that come in everyday that like my food and my crew!!!!!

Thanks,
Joe Users/jherman

20090208 15:25:37 nbsp Joe, it is good that you are using the wiki. Ill be honest and say that I dont like Chipotle because there is an absence of flavor. Sorry you find my humorous comment disgusting but I dated a girl for a couple years that was born in Mexico and, Im just saying, I like flavor and as far as my tongue goes, Chipotle seems lacking in that department. As to the wasting tax payers money comment, do you know how much it personally cost me to run for city council? Names are not put on the ballot for free, candidates pay for it. I felt that the voters deserved the option of a candidate that wants to keep Davis and unique and special place to live. I believe you should have the right to own and operate a business that caters to people that dont like biting flavor. I am sorry to hear that you think democracy should be elitist and that taxpaying citizens like myself shouldnt have the right to run. I dont eat at (PepsiCo owned)TacoBell but I do love Davis Taqueria over and L street as well as El Mariachi on 4th and D. They are always nice to me, never suggest that I would enjoy TacoBell, and, most importantly, have food with great flavor. Users/RobRoy

20090604 22:20:54 nbsp I frequent this Chipotle a LOT. I like the people here and Ive never had a bad experience with the food. Double wrapped with extra beans is the way to go. I did however apply for a job here once immediately after seeing the hiring ad and didnt get it. This wasnt such a big deal but what seriously irritated me was I emailed the manager once and called once and never got any form of response. I tried to see if he was available once in person but he wasnt around. I understand people are busy but a short email takes no time or effort at all.

To RobRoy, dating a mexican doesnt make you not racist. Everyone else seems to enjoy the food at Chipotle, you dont. Such is life, recipes wont be changed just for you and luckily for the company they dont seem to need your business.
 Users/davisreviewer
  Just out of curiosity, why is it that when RobRoy calls a place brown (given that its a verifiable fact that people of hispanic origin are, on average, of a darken skin tone than people of european descent), that is considered racist, but when someone claims this place is whitewashed, nobody cares? to my mind, they are basically the same type of comment, and the only difference is in the group they reference...Users/JoePomidor

20090616 21:12:26 nbsp Same reason theres no Caucasian Studies or Mens Studies major. Both (whether correctly assumed or not) are the majority or ruling class or dominant or however youd like to state it. Ripping on a majority makes you the same as everyone else, including the majority. Insulting a minority, especially coming from a majority or position of power doesnt come across the same as simple ball busting, just rude. Insulting a majority is generally accepted because its been seen that its good fun, while insulting a minority is a way of singling out someone who may have issues with belonging as it is.

20090821 02:01:57 nbsp Ever since we moved in next door where Help Computer Services used to be, I tend to eat here several times a week. The lines looked long sometimes going outside the door but it moves fast so I dont mind standing in it. The food has always been good, tasty, and a healthier meal. The food doesnt vary like other restaurants when the cooks change over the week and the staff has always been friendly. Some people complain about authenticity, but I am more concerned with a great taste, great price, and generous amounts of food for my money. Having meals all over Mexico to Guatemala on islands, on beaches, and in the jungle, people can keep their authenticity. Looking down at a pigs head being cooked in the ground or nearly everything from the chicken thrown into my enchilada is authentic, and quite frankly, fairly gross to me. I am overjoyed to eat Mexican food that is consistent, great tasting, healthy, and in a clean environment from the tables to the restrooms. Users/Cybershield

Honestly? What purpose does that comment serve? If it is a joke, it is a poor and disgusting one. If it is a real life experience, then I highly suggest you seek medical attention immediately. I eat at Chipotle in Davis very often, and the food is always delicious and fresh, and the staff friendly.

Please show some respect for the people who use Daviswiki as a legitimate source of information and opinions about the establishments in our town, and show some maturity, or I dare say the blood stains arent the only problem you will run into regularly in life.

  It was a joke, as it references an episode of South Park. The great thing about this wiki, in my opinion, is that it is not bland and dry, because people are allowed to say what they want as long as its not grossly inappropriate.

   Indeed. Let us now seek the lowest denominator and make South Park references in ALL restaurant reviews. The resulting loss of appetite should help with America obesity epidemic.  Users/DonShor

20100331 00:18:03 nbsp I love the cheap burritos with only 2 items in them, bean and corn. And I love the nice lady who works there most weeknights, shes like a mother away from home. I dont like how expensive the guacamole is and now the increase in price for cheese as single item in a burrito. I like the tabasco and the excellent service though so I get a burrito here often.

 The food at this restaurant is no more or less healthy than any other restaurant, depending on choices you make. Users/DonShor

20110104 02:27:07 nbsp Was closed for some type of remodel on 010310, wonder how long this will last? Users/WesP
  Do you mean 2011? Even if it was 2011, its open now, I was there a few days ago, so I think its safe to say its over. ChrisDietrich


20110413 19:09:25 nbsp I ordered a burrito bowl on the iPod app for Chipotle to pick up at 5:45, and when I got there at 5:50, the cashier said they only have an online order for someone else. However, the cashier chose not to show me the screen and claimed that I never made the order. She then said I could simply wait in line, and the wait would be 20 minutes. Upset that she had told me that I had made a mistake in ordering, I decide to load up the confirmation email on my iPod at another restaurant. I come back to Chipotle with the loaded email on my iPod screen and she finally shows me the order screen without my name. I personally believe that she deleted my order in the time I was gone because she simply didnt want to be wrong. She then tells me to wait in line.
At least last time I ordered online, the cashier admitted that she hadnt had the order ready and prepared it for us on the spot. Every other time I went to Chipotle, there was decent service. Beware Francisca. So much for the customer is always right. Users/Upset!
  Cant help but chuckle at the Customer is always right statement since it is only used by those with a sense of entitlement.  In any sense, I have been to Chipotle several times and the longest I have ever had to wait for my food was about 10 minutes with a line out the door.  Its pretty simple stuff. Yes, your tech may be fun, but believe it or not, just because it states its confirmed on your iPhone doesnt mean the store register has it in their system yet. It takes time to go through the system first. The system covers several stores and it usually takes a bit of time. If you had ordered earlier rather than while on your way there (which is what I am assuming you did), it most likely would have been ready. Same with any of these online ordering services. Heck, its faster calling in my order to Pizza Guys right down the street from where I live than it is to use their computer/iPhone ordering. Next time, either give yourself an extra ten minutes (which you obviously had anyway since you waited elsewhere and then returned) and just wait in line or order earlier using your app. Users/WesP
   Ive ordered using the app and even the website. Every time, including this time, I give myself about an hour ahead of time. Not to mention, I find the confirmation email pretty indicative that the order has been submitted. I choose not to call the establishment because I have issues being understood while ordering over the phone, and I acknowledge that. I just find it kind of fishy that they didnt get my order after having used online ordering so many times beforehand and even once before at this location. Users/Upset!
     All I know is that Im using the codephrase Beware Francisca as some kind of secret agent type message between my wife and I.  I have no idea why, but that amuses the heck out of me. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
