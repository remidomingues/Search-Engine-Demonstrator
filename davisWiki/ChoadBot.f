Here is what Users/RobRoy has to say about ChoadBot (from Friendster):

  When I talked to people about ChoadBot I say, Fuck what you heard. Believe the hype. Because they are a hyped up band and even though it seems like an oxymoron the hype is honest. When I saw them I nearly died. Not because I started screaming so load that in comparison Beatlemania would feel like an afternoon on Cspan but because I nearly suffocated from all the hot sex in the room. And when Berry Choad nearly killed himself when he started breaking every bone in his body he was a Christ like figure. I kept chanting What would Iggy Pop do. And he did what Iggy Pop would do. He grabbed a few innocent audience members and shoved so much hot sex into their orifices that the floor became wet with puddles of joyful urine.


Also, a review by the Dam Haus (Friendster):

  I think the Guiness Book of World Records should contain an entry for The most cliches incorporated into one band: Choadbot (sunglasses at night, rolling around on broken glass, instrument switcheroos, girl in slinky dress playing keyboards, lotsa stripping and nipplerubbing, taking forever to set up, trying to make everyone clap to the beat, boys in makeup, and the newest rock cliche and certainly the most ingenious, a lead singer in a bathrobe and Tevas. It was especially funny that after their hourlong seven song set at Plainfield Station, they offered CDRs for sale with one song on it, and admitted, Its actually our only song. If you havent seen ChoadBot, be ready to hear the word choad more times in one hour than youve ever heard it in all your life.

CM Caskey of The California Aggie and Filthy Pete and the Moustaches said that ChoadBot was the http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/01/06/Features/YourFavourite.local.Band.Sucks1319087.shtml?norewrite200606071906&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com worst band in Davis:

  Every once in a while this group of respectable local musicians from decent bands dresses up in womens underwear and turns into what they call an electroclash band. Ironically, theyre not electroclash. Theyre also not very good. Yeah, I know its not serious. Yeah, I know its a joke. Haha, very funny. It still sucks.

ChoadBot played their last Davis show at the Pirate Ship on Jan 9th, 2005.

On March 1st, 2005, ChoadBot performed their final show at 12 Galaxies in San Francisco.  At the end of the show the band members fell to the ground one by one.  Except for Bafoid, who exclaimed, ChoadBot is dead.  In Berry Choads final words to the audience before he died, he expressed a sincere hope that every member of the audience will have sex later that night, in the name of ChoadBot.

On April 23rd, 2006, Choadbot returned from the dead to play at Delta of Venus.
