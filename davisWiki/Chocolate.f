Chocolate is a delicious dessert confection popular among humans, both male and female. Not only is it very tasty, it is a good source of antioxidants and some minerals, particularly copper and magnesium. The darker the chocolate it is (i.e. the higher the percentage of cacao), the larger the antioxidant and mineral punch it packs.  As Magnesium is particularly essential to proper brain and heart function and is generally lacking in the diets of North Americans, dark chocolate is emerging as a popular health food, though its value and quality are diminished by the sugar and fat that typically accompanies it. All chocolate commercially prepared contains soy lecithin, making it allergenic to those with soy allergies.

 Trivia 

  The cacao tree was discovered somewhere around 2000 years ago in Mesoamerica by the Maya.
  The botanical name of the cacao tree is Theobroma cacao, which translates to be the Food of the Gods.
  Chocolate bars were not developed until the 1800s. Up until that point, chocolate was consumed as a beverage.
   This beverage was made with hot water frothing a liquid chocolate made from refined powder, it was pretty spicy having chili in it, additionally, it often contained hallucinogenics such as psilocybin mushrooms.
  The first Valentines candy box was introduced by Richard Cadbury in 1868.
  White chocolate contains no cacao at all.
      I believe true white choc contains cacao butter. Rather than get into a debate about whether cacao buttercacao, perhaps the original poster can clarify his/her statement. Users/AlphaDog
      White chocolate is pure cacao butter, but doesnt contain much of the theobromide or lighter substances that are found in darker varieties, people who are allergic to chocolate will sadly also be allergic to white chocolate just the same.
  Theobromide in chocolate is toxic to to both people and dogs.   The concentration of this substance is relative to the darkness of the chocolate, and dogs generally weigh much less than a human, so avoid feeding dogs chocolate, especially the delicious darks found in many local stores.  Depending on your dogs weight, it might be able to ingest quite a bit without worry, so dont faint if a lab eats a single chocolate chip cookie.  Its not a good idea to intentionally feed it to them, but an incidental amount now and then is usually okay.  According to the http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfilehtm/bc/211104.htm Merck Veterinary Manual, LD,,50,, for dogs is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of dog, or ^1^/,,16,, of their body weight.  For an 80 pound dog, thats 5 pounds of chocolate.  For a 176 pound human at the human LD,,50,,, its about 13.5 pounds of chocolate.  Thats a lot of chocolate.
