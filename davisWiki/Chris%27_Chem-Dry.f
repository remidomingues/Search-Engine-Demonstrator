In or about April 2011 ChemDry in Davis was acquired by Bells ChemDry.

Chris ChemDry does carpet cleaning with protectant as well as upholstery and leather cleaning and tile and grout cleaning.

cant comment on their actual service. Users/ViVi

20090811 13:42:45 nbsp Ive had great service from this Chris ChemDry.  No complaints here!!  They were able to get out our stains and cleaned up our carpets fantastic!  I was impressed that their cleaners knew so much about carpets and had lots of info for me.  I will definitely use them again in the future. Users/PinkLadie

20101112 11:34:43 nbsp I agree that the woman who answered the phone was rude.  I am looking for a carpet cleaner that uses either no chemicals or natural ingredients.  This woman told me they use something that is not a chemical but is copied from nature and that she cant tell me whats in it because that is proprietary information.  If its copied from nature and isnt actually found in nature, its a chemical.  Anyone know of a place in or around Davis that uses either no chemicals or 100% natural ingredients?  Thanks!

 Water is a chemical. The fatty acids found in natural and synthetic soaps are chemicals. Your carpet is made of chemicals. You are made of chemicals! If you dont want to use chemicals in cleaning stuff, well.... youre out of luck. You just cant clean anythingâ€”period. Users/WilliamLewis

20101112 12:09:26 nbsp William, what I mean is that I am looking for a carpet cleaner that is not made of synthetic, potentially harmful ingrediants.  I know that many chemicals or substances found in nature are also harmful.  I am looking for a company that uses natural, nontoxic ingredients such as borax, baking soda, or other regular, natural and pronouncable ingredients.  Users/SarahHughes
