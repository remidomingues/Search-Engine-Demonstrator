Hey my name is Chris and I am a physics major here at UC Davis, class of 12.
If you would like to get in contact with me, then just leave a comment on this
page and hopefully I will think to check every once and a while. I play water polo,
basketball, and if anybody is up for racquetball I always love a good challenge.
