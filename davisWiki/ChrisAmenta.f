20101201 12:10:32 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Chris, and Welcome to the Wiki.    My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  That is an absolutely outstanding first edit with Zipcar!  Have you been lurking on the wiki awhile, or did you just come across it and see something you knew about and could help rewrite?  Either way, a welcome to somebody on their first edit is traditional, so one again, welcome to the wiki.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
