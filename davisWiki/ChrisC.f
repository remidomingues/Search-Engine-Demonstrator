20090515 13:09:52 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/UC_Davis_Computer_Labs?actiondiff&version219&version118 Please http://daviswiki.org/UC_Davis_Computer_Labs?actiondiff&version221&version120 stop http://daviswiki.org/UC_Davis_Computer_Labs?actiondiff&version225&version124 removing the picture of the old print interface. Further removals will result in further restorations and youll just be wasting your time as well as that of your fellow editors. Were information junkies here and such epherma holds an attraction for most of us. The picture shows the way the print interface used to look and contains something unexpected if you look at it closer. If you have a really good reason why we should make the wiki less enjoyable and informative, please present it. The fact that some people may find it offensive isnt good enough. Unfortunately, just about EVERYTHING in the world is offensive to somebody. We couldnt exist if we excised everything remotely offensive from the wiki. Users/WilliamLewis
