20070813 12:53:53 nbsp Howdy, Chris... you might want to consider using the Preview button rather than saving over and over... each time you hit save, it saves that version, which shows up in Recent Changes and the history, making it more difficult to read the current changes and later on, figure out what youve changed.

Preview sucksif your computer crashes, you accidentally close the window, or someone else starts to edit the page at the same time, you lose your work.  Save, save save I always say.  Why court trouble?  Users/TedBuehler
