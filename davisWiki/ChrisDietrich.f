20110913 22:52:37 nbsp RE: Eve West Bessier  thanks for reverting.  Why is hankim doing what hes doing like adding bogus links and misleading links?  Malicious intent or what?  Heres a message approving layout as such:
 No worries — as I said, I formatted it to a fairly common wiki layout, which doesnt mean the one true way. Aesthetics are always bouncing around a bit because everybody has different opinions. I personally like a bit of variety (take a look at Sunflowers), so Im happy to see a bit of a twist. Im glad you hung with everybody, realizing that its a full pack of people, so you have all kinds of folks with different social attitudes. Just like Davis. Peace and Joy back at ya! —Evan JabberWokky Edwards Users/fknochenhauer

20110913 18:30:59   Thanks, Bruce, Don, David, Evan, et al. Eves page is now nice and tight, wellformatted and represents her value to the City of Davis and Sacramento Communities. I did move the main graphic of her to the left so it faces toward the main body of text instead of her face and view running off the right side of the page. Aesthetics, lookandfeel, etc. Others (Dr. Andy Jones) have similar formatting.

Appreciate hanging with me/us on this. After all these years, I know Eve and her community will greatly appreciate her wiki. Keep it simple. Peace & Joy. Thanks once more. —fknochenhauer

Peace & Joy??? Wow, now I know youre a socialist! ;) — Wes

20111003 20:56:44 nbsp Thx Chris..last time I attributed a comment I was told sternly not to attribute it as the person probably had a reason for not doing so and it can be viewed in the history. Users/PeterBoulay

20111015 20:14:55 nbsp Chris, regarding Chamness Properties, how is it fine to remove OTHER PEOPLES comments? His own I can see... Users/PeterBoulay

20111015 21:01:14 nbsp You are correctI misread it. I apologize. Thx. Users/PeterBoulay

20111015 21:08:12 nbsp Actually, he deleted his own comment, too, so its not clear that he wanted it to stay. Users/CovertProfessor

20111015 21:20:33 nbsp Its hard to say  I dont know if he meant to delete his comment or not.  But because the original author deleted it, I didnt think PB was out of line in deleting it. Users/CovertProfessor

20111017 09:38:35 nbsp Chris  Thank you for your help with Julie Jorgenson, Marriage and Family Therapist Intern! Im brand new to the Davis Wiki and learning on the fly :) Users/JulieJorgenson

20111026 17:24:52 nbsp Thanks Chris for the delete on the Talk page for the Barber Shop...I created on wrong area and was going back to delete.. Users/jeffstanton

20111114 14:01:19 nbsp Where did get the notion they were closing they have been going strong... Users/StevenDaubert

20111114 14:07:09 nbsp its still going up, Im speaking with Village now Users/StevenDaubert

20111114 16:20:48 nbsp You shoulnt say a business is closed with the only evidence of closing being that an anonymous editor deleted the page with his/her first edit. Users/BruceHansen

20111114 16:28:28 nbsp Lets not all jump on Chriss case, shall we?  Weve certainly put Departed Business includes on other businesses just on someones word (yes, sometimes a new editor) that the business was closed.  What he did was completely understandable.  Its just that in this case, some of know this business well enough to know that its not likely to be departing any time soon.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111114 16:54:30 nbsp seconding what CP said.  Weve put departed on pages under the same circumstances all the time  pretty standard wiki practice.  And if it turns out to be wrong, its usually fixed within a few days or weeks by somebody else.  (In this case....all of twenty seconds before the departed include was removed, oh noes!!!)  No worries. Users/EdWins
 Thanks for the perspectives CP an EW.  Im kind of curious where the new anonymous editor was coming from that deleting a business page without evidence of the business closing would be his/her first edit.  It seems malicious. bh
  Agreed. But it could be someone totally outside the recent cab drama, e.g., a disgruntled customer. cp
   Im not much into speculation, but that seems more likely to me than a competitor.  Given the name of the edtor, Users/bikedude, it could have been a disgruntled bicyclist or less likely, a bicycling cab competitor. bh

20111114 19:10:19 nbsp Thanks.  I recall making some hasty edits. Users/BruceHansen

20111120 14:44:33 nbsp Thanks for figuring that out!! Users/CovertProfessor

20111206 21:35:11 nbsp Thank you for clearing up a couple things on The Hotdogger I am new to making pages and appreciate the help. Users/TadFranks

20111208 01:41:48 nbsp do tell Users/StevenDaubert

20111208 19:38:36 nbsp Thanks for the info on the man in the gray suit.  Very interesting!  A lot of people are still wondering about him.  Sounds like the speculations that he was FBI or Dept. of Homeland Security were overblown. Users/CovertProfessor

20111221 21:09:26 nbsp It happens. P Users/WilliamLewis

20120101 17:50:27 nbsp Not sure if Users/LucyRobles this is over the top, but I think it probably needs to be said.  This kind of thing has gotten utterly stupid.  Theres also the questionable fact of a new editor knowing how to restore formatted wiki text directly through the editor rather than the comment macro. Users/JabberWokky

20120117 17:00:09 nbsp Are you sure?  It did have a Davis address. Users/JabberWokky

20120117 17:53:33 nbsp I swear it even had a specific suite number.  Let me check... Users/JabberWokky

20120117 17:55:13 nbsp 602 Adams St, Apt 8, Davis, CA.  Thats Aggie Gardens Apartments. Users/JabberWokky

20120220 12:20:47 nbsp Thanks for checking in with me. I misread the # and thought they were exact. I am wrong here and have retracted the banners. I still have concerns about the similar nature of the comments. Users/PeterBoulay

20120515 16:41:27 nbsp Oops! I got caught up in the table and forgot to restore that comment. Thanks for fixing it :) Users/LoriOrf

20130529 11:42:11 nbsp thank You Chris Dietrich !! yes i was trying to upload from hair by elizabeths page !Q i I would love if you can help me!! :) Users/ElizabethQuesada
