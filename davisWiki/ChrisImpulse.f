To upload a photo on a pageâ€¦

Edit the page
Look for a box near the bottom that says upload files.
A new window opens up, pick an image file from your computer and upload it.
On this same window, a new line will appear with red text.
Copy that text and paste it into the edit page of the Impulse studio.
Preview the changes, and hit save if all is well.

There are other little tags you can add to change the scale of the photos or their placement on the page.
Image(sample.jpg, right, thumbnail, 300,This would be a caption)    Remove that
