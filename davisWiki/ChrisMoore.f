My only connection with Davis is that I fly out of University Airport (and of course I live nottoofar away.)  I came across the DAVISWiki when I was looking up information about the airport.

Most of my free time is taken up by family, refereeing youth soccer, and acting as a Cub Scout leader. Most of my money and not nearly enough of my time is taken up by flying.  I fly both for the fun of it, and on searchandrescue missions for the Civil Air Patrol.  Currently Im renting planes at University Airport, but Im hoping to buy one of my own soon.  I usually have room for a passenger when I fly, and flying alone is boring, so if youre interested in going for a ride send me an email.
