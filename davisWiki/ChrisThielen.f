I graduated UC Davis in 2008 with a CS degree and English minor and work at KDVS, hosting a show called The Senescent Spectacle every Friday from 2:304:30pm. You can listen to previous episodes of it at http://senescentspectacle.blogspot.com/.

Also, I wrote a daviswiki Firefox search plugin so you can find things on the wiki using Firefoxs search toolbar. Place File(daviswiki.src) and File(daviswiki.gif) in your Firefox searchplugins folder and restart Firefox.
