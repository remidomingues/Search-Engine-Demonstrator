I have recently moved to Rancho Cordova (Goodbye Davis!) and have been employed by Cal.Net for the last 9 years. Im not evil, as the Wiki Entry for Cal.Net would indicate Employees of Cal.net to be. Ive been working on expanding items we offer support for, and feel that the company has improved quite a bit.
I formerly lived in Woodland, and consider myself lucky at having escaped with my life and sanity.


20070702 18:47:53 nbsp consider edditng wiki:woodlandas a new wiki it needs more content.  Since you lived there for some time, i figured you would be a good canidate for some edits. Users/MattHh

20071017 11:36:58 nbsp No time for woodland Dr Jones! Thanks for the heads up to its existance though ;) Users/ChrisThompson

20071128 18:00:44 nbsp Hi, nice to hear from you too. Have you been to the Yolo Amateur Radio Society? They are a really great group, although Ive kind of gotten out of amateur radio lately because Ive been more busy with work and LUGOD Linux Users Group of Davis. My call letters are KG6PIP. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080426 12:07:31 nbsp Hi Chris!  Years ago (circa 1997), I lived in Woodland.  Even though it was different, it wasnt so bad.  There was just nothing there at that time, I spent all of my waking hours elsewhere and would just go home to sleep. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080508 22:17:03 nbsp You can also email me (Notratedpg@aol.com) and Id be happy to tell you who I really am (other Wikians have done it and Ive happily shared my identity).  Apparently, Im not good at staying anonymous since some people have come across my page and figured out who I am.     Users/CurlyGirl26

20080511 21:12:23 nbsp Nice pro 95

you should check out the page on the colossus burger, look closely at the image. Users/StevenDaubert

20080512 21:21:21 nbsp Oh, I definitely intend on taking a few pictures and keeping track of the happenings.  As much as I love to photograph events, I dont wanna be that creepy guy at the party that just goes around taking pictures of everything, so I dont know intend on taking many nor will I know how good theyll be. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080515 10:47:08 nbsp Ha!  So a whole three people (that I know of) showed up.  I add that parenthetical comment because I dont know who really showed up since I poorly planned the gathering on the same night as Sophias trivia night.  I ended up staying for a round of trivia with the people that showed, but for a first attempt, it wasnt too bad.  Im wondering if I should create a page for this... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080516 14:05:58 nbsp As far as creating a page for it...I already http://daviswiki.org/DaWiSo have! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090202 16:17:52 nbsp I actually do remember you.  Its certainly not fair if Cal.Nets been changing things up and expanding/changing their business practices.  If you want to restructure the page, I can create a comment archive to dump all the old stuff there. Itll end up being a /subpage, much like what we do for restaurants when management changes and comments are dated.  Users/EdWins ES
    I moved that off to a subpage, and moved off all the other comments as a subpage too.  Itd be great if you could put in a bit about the company.  I wrote a miniparagraph in the middle for the purpose of integrating links to the old Cal.NET stuff. Cheers, Users/EdWins ES.  PS: I really hope things have changed up. Rereading that brought back a lot of memories.  Its honestly was the worst company Ive ever dealt with.

20090210 19:14:58 nbsp Thanks! call it morbid curiosity but which pictures? Im not that much of a photographer Users/StevenDaubert

20090212 21:05:41 nbsp I figured, as those were my most recent photo additions. I really ought to carry a camera around town cause I can sure think of some doozies

 Users/StevenDaubert

20090219 18:35:40 nbsp I just found out today.  I am seriously bummed about it.   Users/CurlyGirl26
