I am a sophomore at Sacramento City College, I am 19 years old and enjoy DavisWiki to no end.  I have lived in Davis, CA since i was born.  I have also been an utter sleazebag ever since that date.


20081021 13:10:00 nbsp You can add one by adding {{{Comments}}} to the bottom of the entry.  However, in most cases (other than reviews) it makes more sense to edit the entry directly.  For instance, the 9th Grade Prank you write about would make more sense as part of the entry itself rather than a comment. Youre an editor just like everybody else  help write the wiki!

20081228 13:00:16 nbsp Can someone delete this page? I am Chris waterstraat, I screwed up my account and started a new one. this one is redundant Users/Water
   You can (anybody can delete any entry on the entire wiki).  Or you can get your old account back if youd like... you might want to consider the importance of using your RealName.  Just ask wiki:wikispot:FAQ here. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
      This is Chris again, i had lost my contact info for the Water account.  I was wondering If you could help me get my old account back, then ill delete this one.
