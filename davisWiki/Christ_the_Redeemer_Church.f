20131031 13:54:58 nbsp Easter Sunday 2013 – After seeing an unassuming ad in the Enterprise, I took a chance and attended Christ the Redeemer Anglican church – I’ve hardly missed a Sunday since!  I found a smallish, but warm, sincere and diverse group of people, and a dedicated, enthusiastic rector with a great sermon focused on bringing the scripture to life and on challenging the congregation to reflect on its relevance today.  I enjoyed the traditional, Anglican worship service, and the welcoming & lively discussion and outreachplanning during the fellowship/refreshment time that followed.  I do miss a thundering organ… but I’m convinced that’s in our future!  My yearslong search for a new church home in Davis is over!  Users/AnneLee

20131106 16:35:13 nbsp I am also glad to call this very welcoming group my new church home.  I have been searching for the right place for several years.  We and our small children feel very much at home, there is a nursery/ play area for them and a community attitude toward the little ones.  They have occasionally helped our Reverand during service:) My daughter was also the first official baptism! The service is traditional yet relaxed and comfortable.  I look forward to growing with this fresh and enthusiastic group.   Users/SHouston
