Okay, so most of Christians shows are in Sacramento, but he counts as local because hes a grad. student and English instructor at Campus UCD. He has had writeups in The California Aggie and has appeared on Live in Studio A on KDVS. He also makes rare appearances at the G Street Pub.

His music is probably best described as Americanaa mix of folk, rock, country, whatever. Christians shows in the past have included such instrumentation as banjos, steel guitar, saw blades, pump organ, mandolin...you name it. Its really smart music, and usually mellow. But he can certainly rock out if hes of a mind to. I once saw him draw blood while playing the banjo.

Check out samples, show dates, and info at http://www.christiankiefer.com his website.

Hes also a staff writer for Sacramento News & Review SNR, and did a http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/20041104/clubber.asp writeup on Rob Roy and the Pirate Ship in the 20041104 issue.
