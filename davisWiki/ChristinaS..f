In case you havent already read it, Id suggest you have a gander at Welcome to the Wiki. It will probably be useful to you at some point if you decide to become a more active member of our community.

As for the George thing, I dont think anyone was implying that George is a drunk. I think it was intended to counter the common criticism of the practice of giving money to homeless or otherwise economically disadvantaged people; namely that such people will just blow the money on alcohol and make their problems worse. Nevertheless, since it might give a false impression, I think you made the right decision to delete what you did.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us. Wed be happy to answer them. Happy editing! Users/WilliamLewis
