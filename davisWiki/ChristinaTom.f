Christina Tom, aka That Fiddler in the Arboretum, attended UCD from 19992004. She was known for randomly assaulting the ears of passerby on the south side of the campus with various and sundry selections from the classical and Celtic repertoire. She currently does not live within the collective earshot of Davis, much to the relief of music lovers therein.
