20110218 http://daviswiki.org/Users/ChristineEvans?actionuserinfo. What class assigned the creation of pages for things that dont exist on multiple wikis? Also, could you get Users/KatieDunn to answer the same question?Users/JasonAller

20110224 18:41:22 nbsp Hey, Christine!  As I just wrote to Katie: I opened a discussion {{{ShadowFax Farms/Talk here}}} about how to handle the Shadowfax Farms entry (cool name, by the way!)  Im kind of mulling over other options, like possibly you using your user account, so it would be something like Users/KatieDunn/Shadowfax Farms, and/or adding a big disclaimer notice at the top.  Its a community discussion, and nobody is against you, were just trying to figure out if a project fits there, and if so, how to present it so it doesnt confuse people.   Welcome to the Wiki!

20110301 20:41:11 nbsp This was NOT assigned by our professor. We did this on our own time, as an example for a good way to market a business. Had I realized that I would be unable to delete this page once it was created, I never would have opened it in the first place. It was meant to broadcast the benefits that DavisWiki offers to our community. Users/ChristineEvans
