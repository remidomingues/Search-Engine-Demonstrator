20051106 20:25:18 nbsp At a different optometrist office in Davis, the appointment took all of ten minutes, which didnt particularly inspire confidence. However, Dr. Chao is very thorough with her eye exams. When she asks you is this better, or is this?, she doesnt mind going back and forth until you finally make up your mind. In addition, they sell a lot of stylish frames (such as Burberry), so you dont have to drive to San Francisco to find something decent. TheoPaaske

20070307 09:18:41 nbsp I just had a great experience there.  The office is comfortable and both Dr. Chao and the staff are very helpful and they were really nice.  Not fakenice like in other offices, but genuinely nice.  The exam was thorough and comfortable, and there is a great selection of frames.  If I werent moving out of Davis next year, Id definitely go back.  JessicaTrue

20070827 14:14:05 nbsp I found this optometrist through this website, having relocated to Davis from the San Francisco Bay Area and in much need of an optometrist. The comments I have found were more than helpful. Dr. Chao and her staff have been extremely helpful than any other medical professional that I have had the privilege of seeing (no pun intended). When it came time to return to the Bay area after graduating from Davis, Dr. Chao was still at my disposal to provide any information requested. I was interested in Lasik and she went out of her way to provide me information and referrals, despite our professional termination of patientdoctor. She has been more than accomodating with whatever requests, especially in accomodating various insurance coverages. I would highly recommend her to any person looking for OD. I even signed on to Davis Wiki with the explicit purpose of making this comment. Goes to show, appreciation goes a long way. Users/manny

20080201 17:46:15 nbsp I am still astounded by the service at Dr. Chaos office. I truly wish every visit to a doctors office went this well. I decided to try contacts after wearing glasses for 5 years and Dr. Chao and her assistant were very nice and helpful in teaching me how to put them in and remove them. The eye exam was very thorough, and their machines are all nice and new. Highly recommended! Users/VinceBuffalo

20080415 23:44:36 nbsp Dr. Chao was so nice and professional.  She really seemed to care about my eyes!  She even faxed my old doctor to find out what kind of contacts Ive used in the past.  Tons of glasses to choose from, friendly staff, clean office. A+ Users/AynReyes

20080918 14:58:43 nbsp Should have came here earlier.  Very nice stuff and very professional.  Highly recommend to Davis students since they give discounts and very good with SHIP.  You dont have to go all the way back home. Users/BessieChu

20090116 09:54:08 nbsp After having a bad experience at the large recently remodeled downtown optometry office, where my prescription for progressive lenses was botched due a very rushed exam, I tried Dr. Chao and will always see her from now on. She spent much more time on my exam and fit me with better contact lenses for my particular eye problem, and she and her staff are extremely pleasant and friendly.  Users/NotSure

20090116 11:43:49 nbsp Dr. Chao is so helpful and really takes her time with you and keeps you at ease. I left knowing that my new prescriptions will be correct (in the past other optometrists get frustrated when you dont know which is better and she doesnt try to sell you really expensive lenses. She even worked with my insurance to make sure that i got the most coverage possible to pay the least out of pocket. I definitely recommend her to anyone!  Users/LeaShell

20090628 19:25:26 nbsp Dr. Chao and all in her office are really great and helpful. I went to this place on the advice of a friend, and would definitely recommend it to others. As mentioned by others, I felt the exam and attention to detail was very thorough, something I did not experience with my old eye doctor. I recommend it highly. Users/DavidBenjamin

20090727 16:38:10 nbsp I created a wiki account to sing the praises of Dr. Chaos office.  Dont be concerned that its easy to get an appointment here: Dr. Chao really gives the sense that she is being thorough with the exam.  For example, she tries about twenty different prescriptions (is this one better?  Or this one?) before settling on one, and she dilates my eyes every time, because I have very weak eyes. No doctor has ever done that before, and Ive been to lots! Stephanie, who works at the front desk, is also amazing, especially when it comes to eking as much as possible out of insurance plans.  Thank you! Users/Sylk

20090813 17:27:55 nbsp She was very nice and really spent time to ensure firstclass eye exam and services (very thorough and patient). The staff were also very nice. I was there for contact lenses and exam, but there were also lots of cool glasses to choose from. Highly recommended! also very good with SHIP/VSP. Users/superdavis

20091028 17:49:46 nbsp Dr. Chaos office is calming and friendly, and filled with positive energy. Until my first appointment with her, Id never enjoyed going to the eye doctor before  but every single person in her office has great vibes and is just very genuine. Dr. Chao is incredibly thorough and made me feel like she was really thinking about my whole eye health picture  not just this single visit. I went to see her very spontaneously after a minor eye injury (I needed a new prescription anyway) based on the praises others had sung about her here on the wiki, and Id encourage anyone whos here fishing around for recommendations to give her a try.

20100227 13:40:57 nbsp Actually went there a year ago. Very satisfied. Recommended. Users/izminko

20100625 14:09:42 nbsp My husband and I have been going to Dr. Chaos for five years now.  She and her staff have always been wonderful and have always provided a kidfriendly office.  They are the best in town. Users/2umma

20100820 14:23:44 nbsp Dr. Chaos office is the best in Davis. She takes VSP for students and everyone in the office is really nice and helpful. The eye exams are very thorough and she makes sure that your eyes stay healthy. They have stylish frames for everyone and cheap frames for those on a budget. Great place for your eyes. Users/seecue

20101004 20:02:29 nbsp Dr. Chao runs a practice where the patient gets the full, undivided attention of the expert.  Dr. Chao gives thoughtful explanations to questions about the exam and eye health.  Stephanie takes her time in explaining how to use contact lenses for the firsttimer, and gives very insightful suggestions on how best to choose framesfrom the aesthetic to the practical.  This practice is undoubtedly among the best I have experienced and I have been in many, many doctors offices as a former pharmaceutical sales rep. Users/PaulHagerty

20101025 23:24:57 nbsp Dr. Chao is super friendly and helpful! Id definitely recommend this place to others. Users/JenniferGiang

20110125 17:26:01 nbsp I went in today. Very friendly and fast service. I was out in less than an hour, which if you include 2 eye test, 1 eye exam, choosing frames, and then buying them. this is incredibly fast. Users/AlexanderYi

20110328 20:54:06 nbsp I was very impressed with my first visit with Dr. Chao. Everyone was super nice, professional and I really felt comfortable in the office.  I wont be going anywhere else!
 Users/YogiJen

20110625 10:45:43 nbsp Not very impressed with Dr. Chaos office. I came onto Daviswiki to read the comments before going for a checkup. Seeing how every comment on here was very positive, I had a high expectation. I feel that majority of the comments are exaggerated. I been wearing glasses for 11+ years now and felt that the service was subpar. I felt rushed during the eye exam and they were not busy at all.  Very limited selection of eyeglasses frame and restrictive office hours. Bought glasses that did not come with a courtesy micro fiber cloth for cleaning (stingy).

On a positive note All the equipments are very new.They have much better equipment than any other places that I have ever gone to. Users/kkha91

     This is Christine Chao in response to users/kkha91.  Thank you for your comments on your experience at our office.  We value all feedback from our patients.  I am truly saddened that you had subpar services here.  We care greatly about each person who comes to see us.  Please call me, as I look forward to discussing your recent visit with us.  Thank you! Users/CJJChao

20130118 20:36:05 nbsp Dr Chao and her staff are very helpful and goes the extra mile. I was looking for a pair of cycling glasses and did not find anything fitting my needs at her office. I found something I liked online at the Nike prescription site and asked if I could order them. Her staff then made a few calls and not only made it possible but helped me determine which style will fit my face shape and prescription. They also researched how much is covered by insurance.  Needless to say, a very satisfied customer.

20140714 17:17:14 nbsp I was very pleased with my experience with Dr. Chao.  She was very competent, took the time to understand my needs, and conducted a careful exam that was not at all rushed but yet did not take longer than necessary.  She and her staff went the extra mile to acquire my records at another providers office, and help me to assess the type of lenses with which I would be most satisfied.  While she has a very good selection of frames, there was absolutely no pressure to purchase glasses from her and she explained pluses and minuses of various options for lenses.  I am happy to provide a very positive recommendation for Dr. Chao. Users/AnneLee
