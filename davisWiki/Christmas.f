Christmas is a Holidays holiday occurring annually on December 25th that commemorates the birth of Jesus the Christ, the person that Christianity Christians follow.

Despite the holidays religious roots, many celebrate a secular version that concentrates on gift giving, family, and kindness to fellow humans. Contrary to popular belief, the date December 25th was not chosen to compete with pagan wiki:wikipedia:Winter Solstice celebrations, which fall on between December 20 and 23 in the northern hemisphere. The date that Christmas is celebrated on today is based on a work of questionable scholarship by Sextus Julius Africanus that was published in the early third century AD.

During this time of year in Davis, the UC Davis university essentially shuts down during the latter half of December, students leave town, many people drink eggnog and Volunteer Opportunities charitable organizations take advantage of the giving spirit.

If you find yourself a bit lonely in December, we offer the following in the spirit of the season!

20071225 19:56:27 nbsp I cant believe that there arent any chinese restaurants open on Christmas.  Not only that, but apparently everything other than Little Prague is closed by 8.  WTF???? Users/Carley

StevenDaubert replies, that could be true, however the is no evidence that even bears on what you have proposed, there is however ample documentation of a pre christian solstice celebration.

20081221 10:23:05 nbsp As it currently stands in modern times, Christmas is definitely a religious holiday, and is celebrated mainly by Christians.  Its celebrating a major religious event that is of significant importance to that religion, and not of importance to most other religions.  Although many of its elements came from other religions or other cultural events (including, as previously noted, Druidic holidiays, and I believe also Hanukkah), it is not, as some people suggest, a secular holiday.
