Christopher Hitchens  A contrarian and friend to sincere writers best known for sparkling prose which thrives despite the misguided missives and illmeaning efforts of pinhead editors.


Hey there Christopher! You might want to check out the Welcome to the Wiki page. The wiki is a public information site, which means no page is owned by any one editor. I happen to be very good friends with Elizabeth, by the way, and she (just like you, and every other wiki editor) is perfectly capable of changing her words herself, but in traditional wiki fashion somebody else is also free to come along and edit more. Please look around and find some pages that need help, thats what we do!  Users/Davidlm

20120116 08:20:04 nbsp You recently wrote, Elizabeths words are her words and not your to edit unless you ask her. That may be true in some cases, but not this one. The wiki is a community resource edited by everyone. Somebody who creates a page doesnt have exclusive control over it. Users/WilliamLewis
 Who are you to decide if someone else besides Elizabeth has control over her words? That is silly. She wrote them and that needs to be respected here.
   They arent her words. This website belongs to the community. wl

20120116 08:30:20 nbsp You might also want to read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner.  Even though youre not the owner of Elizabeths business, it will explain to you why other editors made the changes that they did.  If you look at some of the other stylists pages, youll see that they look similar. Users/CovertProfessor

20120116 12:18:06 nbsp Elizabeth spent her time and energy on creating this page. I do not see why whoever keeps reverting believes they have the right to replace her work. The sheer arrogance of smallminded wannabe editors signifies to me that they should stop editing and go back to English 101! Users/ChristopherHitchens

20120116 12:41:48 nbsp Please discuss the editing on Hair By Elizabeth Quesada/Talk.  Also, please note that all contributions to the wiki are released to the public to edit and modify.  This is a fairly common thing, and the Davis Wiki uses the very common http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution license.

20120116 15:26:24 nbsp Hi Christopher!  Its already been said, but please take a moment to read over Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner.  It pretty much explains whats going on here. Users/TomGarberson

20120117 16:26:31 nbsp So sorry youre aghast and appalled, but this is a collaborative website. You are being very counterproductive by ignoring everyones efforts to communicate and continually reverting the page. Please make an effort to familiarize yourself with wiki norms by reading the many links that have been provided for you. You dont want to wear out your welcome, do you? Users/MeggoWaffle

20120206 12:23:03 nbsp The Copy, as you so accurately call it, is actually in violation of the wikis agreement with the IRS, which prohibits the wikis use for promotional purposes.  A lot of that text is clearly promotional, as opposed to informational.  Its already been linked, but again, please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/TomGarberson

20120206 12:41:17 nbsp Hey, do you know if Elizabeth has the right to donate those photos to the wiki under copyright Creative Commons?  They look like they may be commercial and may not be hers to release to the general public to use and modify.  Since you seem to know her, could you check?  Tom asked on her editor profile, but she hasnt responded. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845
