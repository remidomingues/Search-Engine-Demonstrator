    If you are offended that I have distaste for your favorite thing in the world, please dont assume its because Im some numbskull with blind hatred, however fun that fantasy may be on your part.

20051207 16:16:50 nbsp chris has a couple stalkers Users/MichelleAccurso

20051221 02:51:40 nbsp Chris McKenzie drives extreemly quickly on the interstate. Users/AndrewBanta
  Although I got the ticket, I claim no guilt.  In fact, I believe one would be hardpressed to even make my automobile of choice go that fast; in theory.  But I of course, dont know for sure since accelerating to triple digit speeds would be illegal. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

20060615 17:10:30 nbsp Like we talked about: http://garbagescout.com/sf Users/SteveDavison

20070127 21:34:52 nbsp Brians bike has a huge flywheel that weights close to 200 pounds, and like 7 derailers. When it gets in the gears it can go pretty fast Users/StevenDaubert

20070720 09:49:20 nbsp If you look at the Fluffy Donut page, everything that was there originally has stayed there.  I only added and organized it giving more details about the place.  If you dont like the additional info or organization I do to a page, then revert it. Users/JoAnnaRich

20070924 11:22:11 nbsp what are you afraid will happen? all those car drivers will see all those zombies and pirates having such a great time in the streets, listening to music, riding their bikes and realize how much they hate bicycles?

cars suck our resources, are destroying our environment and are super dangerous. end the tyranny of cars, the streets are ours (too). if you havent rode in a mass yet, come out on friday. think party not protest. also, theres nothing illegal about critical mass since California Vehicle Code 21202 gave us full use of the lane. Users/PxlAted

20070924 11:41:23 nbsp actually, after reading your arguments against KDVS, I dont think I would want to ride with you. if you want to make a similar vs. page about Critical Mass go ahead please.
  Always have your goal in mind and know whether the steps you take work for it, against it, or have nothing to do with it.  This is a difficult question, and its one of discipline.  Working hard towards something doesnt necessarily mean youre doing anything right.
it might get more people to show up. Why stop there either? you should really suss out your feelings about LGBTQIARC on another public page,
  Equal rights do not come by creating separate but equal institutions.  Thats called apartheid.
  The people are unfriendly elitests.  They fight for general acceptance in the community, but a lot of the ones I know have great disdain for their own community, yet alone the nonqueer world.
  The LGBTRC people that I have talked to, except for Sheri, will intellectually shut down if Im not a bootlicker for EQ|CA.  Being provocative has repeatedly and reliably gotten me quickly labelled as some crazy antiqueer neonazi that doesnt appreciate the difficulties of queerdom.
Im sure that would get a lot of attention. Users/PxlAted
  I damn well hope so.  The smallest leak will eventually, given enough time, sink the biggest ship.

20071002 00:42:42 nbsp I have not attacked you on this site or any time. I mean no hostilities, just responding to your publicly stated views.  Id be fine to hang out some time over tea or whatever to talk about critical mass or kdvs. delta of venus sometime? your call... :) Users/PxlAted

20071002 23:59:13 nbsp Ill be tabling at farmers market tomorrow, 25pm. stop by to say hi if you feel like it... Users/PxlAted

20071208 12:31:13 nbsp I liked your question at Ward Churchills talk. I like people who arent sex nazis (regardless of which sex they prefer.) Dogma can be so boring... Users/PxlAted
   i, too, thought chris question was good. too bad churchill cant outright say he thinks the government should be overthrown. anyhow, after the event, Chris hung around and argued with the Maoists from San Francisco. Ward Churchill happened to be standing behind him, tapped him on the shoulder, and told Chris he should stand behind the podium because he was a natural. how awesome to be complimented by w.c.!!

20080109 19:48:14 nbsp Can main street market be moved to wiki:woodland? Users/JasonAller

20080109 20:13:51 nbsp No problem... when youre editing an entry, theres a button at the bottom (next to the Save and Preview) that is labeled Rename.  The idea of editing the entry to rename it is missed by plenty of people... its a pretty common question. Users/JabberWokky

20080502 11:04:36 nbsp hope to see you at maker faire!!!! Users/JessicaRockwell

20080701 12:52:09 nbsp Thank you!  As someone that regularly posts to the events board, I get quite frustrated with people that post those oversized pictures with their events.  Totally kills the postings of others that know how to do it right... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080725 17:41:02 nbsp Um...just wanted to let you know that there is going to be a Davis Wiki BBQ on August 3rd.  Its on the Wiki Gatherings Page, on the newly hijacked OMGWTFWIKIBBQ page, and on the front page.  If you wanna coincide your idea with the current one, thats great.  The more, the merrier!
