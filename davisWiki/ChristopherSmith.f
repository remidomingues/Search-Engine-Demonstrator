I am always looking for lovely ladies to hang out with.  You can find me a kareoke every week try Cantina del Cabo Cantina. I work at on campus, and although I am still a student, I am also Campus Staff staff and therefore have lots  of money to buy myself Bulova watches and take you out.   I am graduating in a couple of weeks I am a fourth year English major from Redding (the ghetto part).
