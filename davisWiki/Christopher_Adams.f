 Candidate Statement for Winter 2010 

My name is Christopher Adams. I am a Civil Engineering major transfer student from Napa Valley College. During my time at NVC I served the Associated Student Body for three years. I first served as a senator interjecting the student voice into academic division meetings I could attend while encouraging my fellow senators to do the same. Before my time at NVC it was rare to see a student at division meetings. I believe it is critical for a student to be present at every level of campus governance to ensure the student voice does not escape the ears of administrators, faculty, and staff for even the slightest moment. Next I served as Vice President where as part of the campus planning committee I encouraged my fellow board members to become involved with program evaluation adding more depth to student representation. At NVC the Vice President leads the Inter Club Council (CFC equivalent) and while leading ICC I encouraged students to become more involved with campus life and the following year student club support was increased 20%. During my second year I served as Student Trustee (the student member of the district governing board). As a member of the Board of Trustee I gradually revised practice and policy by insisting that the student voice be the first to take the floor. My third year I served as President expanding student representation to the accreditation writing process for the first time in NVC history. While attending NVC I authored six resolutions pertaining to student representation, five on the state level (SSCCC), including a resolution advocating for restrictions placed on student trustees to be lifted allowing them full participation. My focus has always been on empowering students, within shared governance, leadership and student life, and within the community. I hope my fellow students can see my passion for student representation, a passion along with experience and dedication I hope to share with UC Davis. My plan for the coming year is to advocate the elimination of senator stipends to help balance the budget, increase support to student organizations by crediting their account with 50 free flyers to help ease the costs of organizing, and continually reach out to all corners of the student body by actively seeking student opinions outside the MU and being available as much as possible. I plan to keep my policy that any student can call me at any time about any issue. I plan to compile a list of every campus committee and post minutes, agendas, and other relevant documents so that any student can just walk by the ASUCD office and know exactly what is going on around campus. I believe that Senators are enablers and will act as such. Feel free to join my facebook group and ask me questions.
