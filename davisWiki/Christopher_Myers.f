What we want to do for you…

We are going to bring back the 3week winter break, reduce student fees, extend bus service hours, and make it easier to find all events on campus.

~ Bring Back Our Winter Break ~

The decision to shorten winter break was made five years ago in order to accommodate religious holidays and the students were neither asked for input nor informed of it until recently. We will work with both the student body and the administration to find alternative accommodations without shortening winter break.

~ Reduce Student Fees ~

Where are the higher tuition fees going? The current breakdown provided by the administration is vague. We are interested in publishing a detailed and understandable breakdown of our tuition fees.

We will work with the state government through the UC Lobby Corps to pass legislation that ensures the proper allocation of our funds to student services.

~ LowCost to Free Textbooks ~

We will alleviate the financial burden of purchasing textbooks by working with professors to: provide alternatives like opensource textbooks, encourage the development of the Dynamic Textbook Project (ex: ChemWiki), and require mandatory textbooks on reserve for every class.

Have you ever collaborated with students on a study guide through google docs? We will work with creative media to create a website that features a tutoring system, a forum for class discussions, and study guide collaborations.

~ Student Transportation ~

We will extend bus services for nights and weekends and develop mobile apps to track them in real time for both iOS AND droid users.

~ What’s happenin’? ~

We will create an easily accessible calendar to centralize all campus events in one place: from ASUCD events to lectures sponsored by departments.
