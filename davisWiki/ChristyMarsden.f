 Christy Marsden 


Basics
 I finished my Masters in Horticulture and Agronomy in 2011.
 I graduated in June 2008 with a BS in Human Development, minor in Environmental Horticulture from UC Davis.
 I currently live in Decorah, Iowa and work at Seed Savers Exchange. Decorah could use a wiki.

Past Work
 I worked as a plant technician for the National Clonal Germplasm Repository with the USDAARS, which included frequent trips to the elusive Wolfskill Experimental Orchard Wolfskill in Winters.
 During the summer, I split my time between the Repository and a plant pathology lab on campus working with Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
 I drove buses for Unitrans, and was the Human Resources Manager from 20072008.
 During graduate school, I was a TA for various horticulture courses. My favorite part of grad school by far.

Extras
 I Davis Knit Night knit. A lot.
 I enjoy playing Kubb.
 I like plants.
 I was the 100th member of DavisWiki, and because I love the wiki I have a weirdly vast knowledge of Davis.

Oh, Davis
 I really liked Davis in the summer when the city seems to relax for a few months.
 Davis Noodle City was my favorite place to eat. Taste of Thai was a close second.
 Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks is an excellent place to drink beer. And Sophias for everything else (drink wise, not food wise). de Veres Irish Pub de Veres will be when the crowds die down.

Leftovers
 I was a member of Prytanean Womens Honor Society Prytanean.
 I was in Integrated Studies.
 I worked as a CASA.
 I volunteered for four years in the Arboretum.

Hopes and Dreams
 Fall in love.
 Find a happy place to be.



I like to think Im a good person to know. But hey, I hardly know myself, so who knows?

20060726 13:55:04 nbsp Hey there! Yeah it wasnt so much that John was conservative as he was kind of an asshole about it. Like I know so much more than you and whatever you have to say Im going to argue with just for the hell of it. Yeah but anyways... we should play more IM sports in the fall and winter! Users/AngelaPourtabib

20060728 08:22:55 nbsp Hey Christy! Do you think Friends of the Arboretum would be willing to donate one of their very cool plants for the wiki fundraiser? Im thinking you might have a contact. Users/AlphaDog

20060811 12:13:41 nbsp Oh and thanks for the edit! and check out  my new project http://coursecollab.org ! Users/VinceBuffalo

20060820 20:18:03 nbsp I see that you have Watch every Star Wars movie listed. I dont have episodes IIII, but I have the original trilogy if you want to watch them sometime. Users/TracyPerkins

20061115 23:05:44 nbsp I mostly dont get any trouble from Unitrans drivers about the RT sticker, but that would still be helpful. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061120 05:32:27 nbsp Lulz, Thanks Christy! I know a lot of ppl get those, but you wouldnt believe how much spam i get back from sending them ;) Users/MaxMikalonis

20070515 11:43:33 nbsp Thank you for your positive feed back on 3rd street jeweler. it was a pleasure. Frank A. Users/3rdstreetjeweler

20070607 23:54:49 nbsp Yo yo you volunteer at CASA? Good work man... Users/AngelaPourtabib

20070724 12:13:17 nbsp Yeah, I noticed Prytanean when I was reading through the California Aggie through the 1950s and 60s.  Its been in Davis longer than most of the fraternities, even, so Id love to see what kind of history you have. Users/BrentLaabs

20080621 19:59:45 nbsp I finally got my ass in gear and made a Davis Wiki account...and the first Random Page to pop up on the home page is none other than...ChristyMarsden.  What are the odds? Users/TimFrazee

20080917 11:23:57 nbsp I love the Wiki and I love that youre on it! Users/AynReyes

20081219 19:31:52 nbsp Ive never heard people call baby grasses cute. Do you pat them too? Users/glyster

20090602 02:56:36 nbsp Hey, thanks for making the page!  Im more of a sewing guy myself, but us strings and needles folk need to stick together.  :)  Users/JabberWokky

20090602 22:12:00 nbsp thanks for your comments on the growlers hop plot.  I do plan to continue to update the hole process... pest management, harvesting, processing the hops, and then brewing a batch of beer with the hops.  If you ever want a tour I am happy to provide, I am often down at the garden on the weekends or some weeknights.  Are you a brewer? Users/matiasek

20100207 18:48:24 nbsp Agreed!  Lets hope they go scurrying back to SoCal with their tail between their legs. Users/CovertProfessor

20100215 16:19:08 nbsp hey are you looking to move out of your apt this year? i am willing to pay $ for the lease pass down Users/meghanolmstead

20100310 11:26:58 nbsp That iPod thing is pretty crazy.  Keep us updated!  And if you want any help looking into it Id be happy to make some calls or whatever as well (nothing better to do at the moment). Users/TomGarberson

20100310 16:37:26 nbsp Wooo IS!  And wow, thats pretty crazy.  Thanks for the update, good to know how that works.  And, if the ARC knows about it, its incredibly shady of them to keep doing it. Users/TomGarberson

20100311 08:51:41 nbsp I assume this is the UCDPD, not the DPD?  My suggestion would be to drop by the Aggie office and find an enterprising journalist who wants to do some investigation for what could be a really quality article, and let them know the details of what youve learned.  If theres any sort of a pattern here, thats a BIG dealwhether its the PD or the ARC responsible.  Its possible the Enterprise would be interested as well... while its a pretty universitycentric thing, its definitely a story. Users/TomGarberson

20100311 08:52:35 nbsp Dang.  I was hoping the best for you. Users/JabberWokky

20100311 08:57:27 nbsp Its funny... if a private citizen did what the police did, it would be wiki:wikipedia:Conversion (law) conversion. But since theyre the police, they can do what they did, even though there is no compelling reason for them to have the special ability to auction property that doesnt belong to them, especially when an iPod has identifying information on it, be it in software or the optional engraving on it. Users/WilliamLewis
  I dont know that they necessarily can (I also dont know that they cant).  People are just far less likely to challenge them on it.  Its pretty common for PDs to just do whats convenient for them until they get a reason not to (i.e. a lawsuit or threat of a lawsuit).  The same is true of businesses and pretty much everyone else, they just get called on it far more often, so they learn better. Users/TomGarberson

20100328 18:54:23 nbsp I just read your posts about your lost ipod. You should call the school paper. Thats a pretty dang good story and an issue that obviously needs attention. Users/gkrisser

20100907 10:40:20 nbsp coot puppy!

If you want to be a runner, jog in the arbo its looong


How is the plant path coming along?  Users/StevenDaubert

20100910 00:34:57 nbsp Sweet, Yeah pops works in George Bruenings lab... How many career hours did you have with unitrans? Users/StevenDaubert

20100914 00:55:41 nbsp Daaamn above 3k niiice

When I was little I would take a bluebird P/G to West D for occupational therapy, this is long time ago Users/StevenDaubert

20101011 21:34:31 nbsp Wow, thanks for the info on The Dumpling House!  Thats amazing news, Im going to have to take advantage.  Dont hesitate to edit the main text of a page, especially with awesome stuff like thatits definitely noteworthy!  I went ahead and noted it up at the top. Users/TomGarberson

20101011 22:54:38 nbsp Blerg... Honestly, just about everyone I know whos been to Bistro more than once or twice has had bad experiences there.  For some reason, though, they keep going back.  I prefer to give businesses feedback in the form of money.  If I like them, I support them.  If they give me horrible service and then treat me like Im trying to rip them off when I tell a manager about it, I stop supporting them.  Im always surprised when I see it crowded (which it usually is). Users/TomGarberson

20101011 23:52:51 nbsp More pages are good pages!  Just make sure you tie them into the wiki.  If they dont link to anything, theyre essentially dead ends.  If nothing links to them, theyre impossible to find except on Recent Changes or via a direct search.  If you need help with anything, just drop it on a page or in an edit note and someones sure to swing by.  Users/TomGarberson

20101014 18:35:02 nbsp Thanks!  When I read his comment, first I did one of those O.o things, then I cracked up. Users/TomGarberson

20101021 23:24:13 nbsp Nice!  Ive got a good friend recently out of the entomology masters program working as a PCA down in Watsonville.  He loves the work, hours of the summer were brutal, though.  Congrats on your success in the running department! Users/TomGarberson

20101101 16:23:49 nbsp Ew... I would have preferred it to be sap rather than poo... Unfortunately I live in an apartment complex so I really have no control over what I can do to the tree unless I take it up with the property manager I guess. Users/hankim

20101207 19:02:17 nbsp The qualifying phrase at least as Davisites go is important.  Im not sure what Dunnings standards are, but I think its at least 20 years.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20101207 23:27:02 nbsp The ARC in my opinion mismanages itself or is overrun with corruption when compared to all the other gyms I have been to and I am pretty sure the university does not have a contractor running the place (so it is run by university people). Not that I have faith that the university will make a deal that benefits students if they ever did get a contractor to run the place (look at Sodexo). Here is a small slice of all the problems I have with the ARC: http://ucdbs.com/?page_id12 Users/hankim

20101208 10:31:35 nbsp Ah ha!  I have discovered you are not Jewish!  Of course, neither am I... I forgot it was Hanukkah until I was flipping through my Old Farmers Almanac this morning.  The holiday only lasts for another day, but I figured Id toss up a nice logo to recognize the folks in Davis who are celebrating the holiday.  Bashfully, I must admit I have forgotten both it and Ramadan in the past through simple ignorance, but Im generally try to catch as many holidays as possible that are commonly celebrated in Davis (thus the Picnic Day logos, etc).  Anybody can contribute a logo at Wiki Logo... nobody has made one for Christmas or New Years yet!  Pi Day and March 28th would be other neat ones to have (March 28th being the day Davis was incorporated). Users/JabberWokky

20101208 22:19:30 nbsp Ah, but you never know.  Maybe you will get a PhD here, or postdoc... or... or...? Users/CovertProfessor

20110121 21:15:55 nbsp Since you work at Wolfskill, would you mind taking some pictures? The picture we have on there right now isnt licensed for people to use freely and we really could use some more, anyway! Users/WilliamLewis

20110121 23:16:25 nbsp Haha, actually, unfortunately (very much so), Dr. Jones isnt my dentist. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a way to get him, because his reviews are so uniformly exemplary, but my strange insurance situation meant no PPOs for me. However, when my Users/kingjesse2 housemate (who does have a PPO) asked me if I knew any good dentists, there was really no hesitation involved. Users/JoePomidor

20110123 01:51:53 nbsp Wow, Im always amazed by the coincidences that seem to crop up. For instance, another one of my housemates mother just happen to work with my father...in Livermore. We found this out after becoming housemates. Users/JoePomidor

20110226 17:02:16 nbsp Coco and her companions have been reunited. Users/PaulThober

20110315 11:23:33 nbsp No worries! Thanks! Users/WilliamLewis

20110315 13:43:53 nbsp Sent you an email with permissions. I hope thats what you were looking for! Users/GregHirson

20110509 21:14:36 nbsp No problem, thanks for putting the event on the board! Users/TomGarberson

20110512 19:42:35 nbsp It was a blast!  Pretty good turnout, lots of fun with the live Karaoke.  The staff at the Grad seemed really into it, they were really engaging.  Definitely a success. Users/TomGarberson

20111007 15:38:02 nbsp Im not heading up Occupy Davis. Im just pointing people in the right direction :)
It seems like someone has got some facebook stuff happening. Im not on facebook though, so I thought Id help out however I can.
Ill be there tonight though, maybe Ill see ya there.
 Users/ConsciousConsumer

20111008 16:18:44 nbsp Thanks.  I wasnt aware of the activity on the bikepedestrian bridge.  The top 1% will surely quickly make things equitable now that the issue has been called to their attention, so there wont be any need to say anything from the bridges  ha. Users/BruceHansen

20111104 19:25:49 nbsp Ah, I didnt realize it was on the page twice!  I restored your edit.  I thought it was funny  you dont seem like the type to go around deleting history.  I should have known! Users/CovertProfessor

20111128 17:17:40 nbsp Leaving Davis is sad :(  Congrats on landing a job, though.  Thats always something to be thankful for.  I hope Decorah is good to you! Users/TomGarberson
