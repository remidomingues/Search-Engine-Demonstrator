It looks like you added your comment by using the edit button at the top of the page.  Just wanted to let you know that if you use the comment bar at the end of an article, just before the posted comments start, it will add in the formatting (time/date, username, etc) for you automatically.  Editing the page works too, though! Users/JonathanLawton
