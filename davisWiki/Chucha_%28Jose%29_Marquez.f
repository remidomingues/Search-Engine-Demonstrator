Chucha (Jose) Marquez is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2012 ASUCD Election running on the SMART slate.

 Candidate Statement 

Hello fellow Aggies!

My name is Chucha. Im a third year readmitted student studying Psychology and Chican@ Studies, and Im running for ASUCD Senate with the SMART Slate, which seeks to give a voice in ASUCD to underrepresented communites on campus. I hope to be that voice, as well as an advocate for a better quality education for all Aggies alike.

Platforms:

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE NIGHT

I am constantly amazed by all the wonderful talent UC Davis students bring to our campus. As a Senator, I will create a quarterly performance night for student performance groups and individual students to showcase their talents. I believe that the arts enhance the student experience on campus and can be a fun and educational way to expose students to a side of Davis they might not have a chance to experience elsewhere. I also hope that this will provide a space for student performers to gain exposure and further their endeavors.

FACILITATE READMISSION PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ON DISMISSAL AND WITHDRAWAL STATUS

I will create an ASUCD webpage that outlines the process of readmission for students and provides resources so that they can continue their studies at UC Davis. As a student that has gone through the complex, bureaucratic process of readmission, I know firsthand how frustrating this process can be. Every student is faced with unique circumstances, and I want to develop a onestop comprehensive guide for all students to have the opportunity to complete their education with their fellow Aggies!

Together, the SMART Slate will work towards the following:

MORE TEXTBOOK RESERVES

We will work to save students money by creating a textbook reserve located in the new Student Community Center, supplementing the Shields Library Reserves and giving students muchneeded additional study space with free access to the most common GE books.

FUNDING FOR ETHNIC/LAV GRADS

Community specific graduations celebrate the achievement in higher education of students from underrepresented and marginalized communities. By granting funds to these events we seek to actively create a safe and inclusive campus environment which celebrates the diversity of our student body.

VOTE CHUCHA (JOSE) MARQUEZ #1 FOR ASUCD SENATE, SMART #26! BREE ROMBI AND AMY MARTIN FOR EXEC!
