The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints (often abbreviated LDS) is a popular Spiritual organizations church whose members are called Mormons. Davis is part of the Woodland Stake, which includes congregations in Woodland, Davis, Dixon, and Winters.

There are presently two congregations (called wards) which meet in the Davis chapel.  Their Sunday meeting times are:

Davis Ward:
  Main (sacrament) meeting  9:30 am
  Sunday school  10:40 am

Elmwood Ward (comprising unmarried adults ages 1830):
  Main (sacrament) meeting  12:30 pm
  Sunday school  1:40 pm

All people, regardless of religious affiliation, are invited to attend meetings of either ward on Sundays.

In addition to meetings on Sunday, other meetings occur throughout the week at the meetinghouse location.  Typically these meetings are for specific groups such as Boy Scouts or free English classes.

The Institute of Religion offers collegelevel religious instruction to LDS students and anyone else interested. For more information, see the website above or stop by the Institute of Religion during the UC Davis school year.
