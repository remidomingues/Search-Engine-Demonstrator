The Church of the Divide is a church in the original sense of the word: a gathering of likeminded Christians. They do not have a building and they meet in the homes of their members. In other words, theyre a wiki:wikipedia:House_church house church. The closest thing they have to a pastor is Dick Otterstad. Their membership is small, likely around ten members. The pastor revolves depending on whose house services are being held at, but the pastor is always male due to their interpretation of scripture.

They have gained notoriety in Davis for picketing in front of First Baptist Church First Baptist Church of Davis because the pastor, Glenn Snyder, refused to publicly rebuke Users/FreddieOakley Freddie Oakley, the Yolo County recorder and member of FBC at the time, for issuing Certificates of Inequality to homosexual couples trying to get marriage licenses on Valentines Day 2007. What really peeved them was when Pastor Snyder said that Freddie would always be welcome at the church.

Outside of Davis, the Church of the Divide has carried out many other protests. For example, they routinely protest outside WalMart WalMarts because of WalMarts donation of $60,000 to prohomosexual organizations. Their ministries include http://www.gaymarriageno.org/ GaymarriageNo, http://cftie.org/ Citizens for Truth in Education, and probably others. A couple people have noted that TCOTD looks and acts very similarly to the Preachers with signs.

The church and its associates have had more than a few runins with the law because of their activities. Members have been arrested for things like creating a public nuisance, assault and battery, and blocking traffic during their protests.

20070227 16:31:31 nbsp The church of the divide is made up of five adults and three minor children.  Dick and Luke Otterstad and  Carolyn OConnor are from Garden Valley.  Todd and Beth Braun are from Auburn.  The church of the divide is a umbrella for save our slaves gaymarriageno  citizens for truth in education and a least one other that slips my mind right now.  Church of the divide is not a church.  It is only these handful of people and whomever they can recruit for their protests.

He has demonstrated along side the cotd many times.  After high school Tim joined the Minutemen and became the press secretary for the group.  Just recently Tim has been in a battle to keep control of the Minutemen away from its board members.  This is a developing story.  The board members accuse Tim of the misuse of almost a million dollars in contributions.  Tim says the board members have stolen his email list.  Like I said, it is a developing story and should be interesting.    . Users/JerryRafter

The case has been presented and is waiting a ruling.  Ive often wondered how the Otterstads who have a brush clearing business in Albany, Ca (Oak Hills Brush Clearing @925 Adams St.previously know as Otterstads Brush Clearing of the same address) can afford to take seemingly minor cases all the way to the Supreme Court of Minnesota.  Also take note that Lukes partner in this incident is Robert A. Rudnick. Users/JerryRafter

20070220 22:47:20 nbsp I saw the video file posted. Its disgusting... these people have little respect for human dignity and remind me of the Westboro Baptist Church that picketed the Episcopal Convention in Minnesota calling other Christians hurtful derogatory remarks. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070221 00:35:02 nbsp That sucks, but as long as it stays nonviolent and doesnt infringe on private property, thats free speech, right? Users/KenjiYamada

20070221 18:51:24 nbsp The video is poorly shot, these guys remind me of preachers with signs.  The fact that they protest WalMart also disappoints me.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070221 20:31:56 nbsp video is poorly shot, editing is rather comical. Whole thing smacks of propaganda. Users/StevenDaubert
   lol, thats because it IS propaganda. I think the best way Ive ever described these guys is religious bullies, they claim Christianity for the sole purpose of twisting it so they can lord over people and hurt others. Also, should this page get linked to preachers with signs? Users/JamesHaile

20070223 10:50:46 nbsp Judging by that video on their site, First Baptist Church in Davis seems pretty hateful and intolerant of visitors coming in to worship. If they welcome Freddie Oakley, they should welcome these guys too  isnt that the loving thing to do? Users/DanStanford
  FBC did nothing hateful or intolerant. Also, those visitors didnt come to worship; they came to protest. There is a big difference. If these people had come to worship, they would have been welcomed. Users/WilliamLewis
    I would bet dollars to dimes that if TCOTD brought its congregation to FBC without the signs, and without trying to force there message on others and just went in and enjoyed the service and worshipped FBC would have welcomed them like they welcome everyone.  Users/StevenDaubert

20070223 22:40:10 nbsp Theres a little comment battle going on in the http://www.youtube.com/watch?vSKZBTz2hsI YouTube page for the video. Unfortunately The COTD requires approval of all comments before they get posted. Very confident in their stance arnt they? Users/JamesHaile

20070224 13:24:17 nbsp Id imagine they get quite a lot of hatemail... Im suprised they allow any comments at all. Users/DanStanford

20070224 13:27:56 nbsp They have a disclaimer that states anything sent to them becomes there property and they can post it on the site if they want to. Users/StevenDaubert

20070301 10:38:58 nbsp So as long as I shred Luke Otterstad and COTD, Im good, but to biblically address issues like them gets my comments canned? Users/MarieGruca
   No, to discuss them is fine... support them if youd like.  To debate their message is what doesnt really have a place here.  Tell us what theyve done thats good, what they believe in.  Thats discussing them.  To put it another way, on an entry about the local high school football team, you could discuss their budget or their new uniforms.  When the discussion is over, the facts are picked out and incorporated into the entry and the discussion deleted.  You could even state an opinion or review about the football team.  But discussing football in general (if grass or astroturf is better or talking about the Superbowl) is not related directly to the subject at hand... it isnt about the actual high school football team.  I (and others) would love you to support CotD by telling us what they have done or provide more information about who they are.  To put it another way, the CotD makes signs.  But debating here about the best way to paint and construct signs would be offtopic.  In the same way, debating the biblical support (for or against) their message is offtopic.  That debate isnt about them, its about you and the people youre debating with, and has nothing to do with the actual Church of the Divide.  I hope you understand.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20070302 09:59:32 nbsp Jerry  thanks for all the background.  Do you have anything more specific about their activities in Davis? Users/JabberWokky
  20070302 10:27:59 nbsp Nothing you dont already know about Davis and Woodland.  Dont be too surprised if the cotd doesnt show up in town some day with 500 Russians and Ukraines as they did in Sacramento.  Thats a whole other story. Users/JerryRafter

20070304 11:58:31 nbsp http://nutritionalprograms.com/NSP_Testimonials_MorerFromClients.htm    This one made me laugh out loud.  Dick Otterstad is so concerned about the sanctity of gay marriage  but his own marriage seems to be a failure.  If you run into Dick at one of his protests on gay marriage, ask him why he lives in Garden Valley and his wife lives in Walnut Creek. Users/JerryRafter

20070508 11:30:47 nbsp COTD is at it again, a principal in sac suspended students who were wearing shirts with the bible verse that states homosexuals go to hell. Go go principal, as those shirts are designed to intimated others, and shouldnt be allowed in the school. Also those kids are under 18 and dont have the right to free speech. The bee article briefly touched upon COTD anticts in Davis. Users/StevenDaubert

20070508 11:45:31 nbsp I sat in Ronald Brocks antigay truck while he explained to me that he of course had homosexual feelings when he was young. Then he offered me a bagel.

Heres a clip:

Brock said the message is simple: If you claim to know God, you must fight your homosexual tendencies.
Especially in our youth, weve all gone through that floundering around, Brock said.  (But) just because you have a weakness, do you give in to that weakness?

  Florin Ciuriuc was the Director of the Slavic Community Center in Sacramento.  Read his quote.
 for the past several years the COTD has been furnishing the Russian/Ukraine group with signs and shirts denouncing gays and lesbians.

20071203 00:03:37 nbsp Luke Otterstad of The Church of the Divide has tabled at American River College the fall semester of 2007.  Their Christian Civilization Club lost its license after comments characterized as inflammatory against Muslims. See:

Save ARC owes this site a very appriciative THANK YOU for giving us an idea of who and what these few individuals represent in our community.

It should also be reported that the ARC InterClub Council performed symbolic marriage ceremonies for any couple who wished to marry as a fund raiser during Club Day on Feb 14, 2008.  It was closely observed and video recorded by at least nine supporters of the CODs philosophy.  Users/saveARC

20080524 23:42:45 nbsp Luke Otterstad from the Church of the Divide is up to the same things this semester.  He has again used the picture of a transgender student to fan the flames of intolerance and has motivated a conservative majority to get out and vote.  Luke Otterstad defends their actions before the ARC Board of Justice.  See www.savearc.com for all the latest links and information.  Users/saveARC

20120321 11:38:26 nbsp I actually had to work with Luke Otterstad at the Sacramento City College SCC school newspaper back in 2009. He seemed alright at first, but holy crap, once I found out about all this lovely stuff, I was absolutely horrified. Plus, he and his cronies in the student government stirred up a lot of controversy that same semester; I guess much like what happened at American River College ARC. It was all very crazy, but fascinating at the same time. Luke seemed to be such a balanced and smart young man. But with all of this... the only thing I can call this and what he does is hate. Im sure the SPLC would label this group as a hate group... Users/CecilioPadilla
