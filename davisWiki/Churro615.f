I reside in South Davis, I have two cats Poof and Baby, and a dog named Daisy. I am also an avid volunteer at the Yolo County SPCA.

Churro appears to be a person of Daisy the dog.


20091002 23:43:27 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Churro, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding to the Yolo County SPCA entry, but things like the rabbit adoption make more sense in the body of the entry rather than the comments.  Everything on the wiki was written by somebody like you, so feel free to edit and add that kind of information directly  thats how the wiki grows and reflects more of the community.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101207 21:51:00 nbsp My condolences on the loss of Heidi. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101207 21:58:29 nbsp Thanks... its been really hard. She was a very sweet dog, and she was taken from us very unexpectedly  Users/Churro615

20110124 19:13:04 nbsp Thanks for all your work on the Feral Cats and Spay Day pages!  Are you going to be volunteering at Spay Day?  My wife will probably be there spaying/neutering. Users/TomGarberson

20110124 19:14:44 nbsp I will be volunteering for Spay Day! I will be at the South Davis Vet Center.  Users/Churro615

20110124 19:47:14 nbsp Nice!  Should be a lot of fun, and its definitely something that needs doing.  By the way, I reverted the deletion of the Bunnies page for Yolo SPCA, and instead noted at the top and on the YSPCA main page that they no longer adopt out rabbits.  The Wiki is big on preserving town history, so we usually try to keep old info in place and just note that its outdated. Users/TomGarberson

20110124 21:43:28 nbsp Thanks!  Users/Churro615
