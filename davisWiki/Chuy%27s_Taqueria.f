Locations have been newly remodeled as of early 2009. Each meal comes with an unlimited supply of homemade chips + homemade salsa.

A regular burritos burrito is $5.50+tax and a super burrito is $7.50+tax. (Chips are included.) They serve them wet (with a bit of sauce poured on them) on a plate, with a garnish of shredded lettuce and a piece of tomato.

There are also many daily specials throughout the week.

20080223 23:57:33 nbsp Ive only eaten their super burritos, but theyre pretty good.  Although their burritos are different in taste, I think theyre on par with Taqueria Guadalajara.  I like how they put sliced avacados instead of guacamole in the burritos.   Users/BenLee

20080509 15:03:20 nbsp i invite everyone to try their diabla sauce. its normally on their camarones a la diabla, but you can ask for a side of it to go with your tacos burritos what have you. its amazing. Users/SylviaFlores

20080606 09:07:00 nbsp If you like Prawns try the Coctel de Camarón for a summer treat. It is a cold shrimp coctail, but light like a cold soup.  Also, the Adobada (seasoned pork)burritos are really good. Users/LokiAbbi

20080707 17:22:02 nbsp They have delicious carnitas,and I am happy to report that that is especially true in conjunction with their quesadillas and nachos. Also, the horchata is a delightful discovery for someone who has never had it before. Users/JoePomidor

20080731 09:41:18 nbsp They actually make fresh salsa EVERYDAY! which is great, not like guadalajara, they keep theirs for days! the server at chuys, natalie, the most hard working server ive ever seen. she workes TWO jobs, tip her well, she deserves it. this place is what u cal REAL mexican food. Users/SamiSam

20080913 22:14:13 nbsp Friendly service, and hurray for reuseable salsa trays if you eat in! Users/Angel.York

20081014 07:38:22 nbsp After reading the positive reviews and wanting something a bit different than normal, my lady friend and I headed across town from South Davis to Chuys.  It wasnt the best tauqeria and certainly not the worst.  The taco shells and taco salad shell seemed to be a bit old or even store bought.  The steak was chopped up into little balls of meat instead of longer strips you normally receive when ordering carne asada.  Probably related to the quality of the meat used and small cuts make it less chewy or harder to notice the fat.  The server was friendly, the place was clean and the food was presented fairly well, but that taste was not fantastic.   If you live nearby I could see giving it another chance or finding a favorite item on the menu, however there are much better taquerias in Davis.  Glad I tried it but dont expect I will be visiting again. Users/loneshark

20081118 12:57:07 nbsp Heres a rundown of last nights visit to Chuys, told in the second person:

1. You order fish tacos, but they are out of fish. You opt for the shrimp instead. Bad choice?
2. The glasses your sodas have been poured into taste like soap.
3. Chips and salsa are served. The salsa tastes like pizza sauce, so you add salt. The salsa now tastes like salty pizza sauce.
4. Your food is brought to you by a friendly staff member. You eat it. Its not bad, but the shrimp seems underseasoned. You add salt.
5. The beans your girlfriend ordered taste like they are cooked with lard. This is a problem, since you are both vegetarian (well, except for fish).
6. You leave. You are not completely disappointed, but youll probably go somewhere else next time. Users/ifoundthistape
    sorry senor, but real mexican food wasnt designed for california vegetarians...


20081209 20:24:41 nbsp I love this place burritos are huge for only 4.50. Users/LizMelack

20090101 18:11:55 nbsp This is a problem, since you are both vegetarian (well, except for fish)  right, eating fish means you are not a vegetarian, come to grips with your desire to eat flesh and move on, or manup and give up meat, fish dairy and eggs and wear your vegetarian mantle like a true warrior.

As to all the posts claiming chuys is bad, guad good or vice versa: they are 2 different experiences. Guad has the best carne asada I have ever eaten  bay area, LA and san diego included (being a robertos/albertos diehard). Chuys comes in a close second. However for true scrappyness in moving into a complex that is ghost town and surviving and overall best food, service and always having cold bohemia, chuys wins hands down. Fish tacos are awesome and rival picantes in berkeley.

As for the other posts claiming that there are no good mexican places in Davis... you are high.

That is all. Users/ebone

20090111 20:15:11 nbsp I love this place, I eat quite often in both locations. You get as many chips as youd like before the meal, and the portions are huge. The daily specials are a pretty good deal, especially Wednesdays when the burritos are $4.50 for a super and $3.50 for a regular. I really like the carintas at the Davis location, and the crispy potato tacos at the Winters location.

They just remodeled in Winters and opened an adjoining Mexican bakery, so it looks pretty nice and still serves up delicious food. They go out of their way to help the community in Winters, making 50+ burritos quite frequently for the SLEWS bunch to be picked up fresh at 7am, way before they officially open. Who else would do that? Users/ChristyMarsden

20090113 12:49:43 nbsp Chuy should be ashamed!!!!! the ceviche was awful! since when does jumbo shirmp cut in half and served on a tostada equate to ceviche?!?!?! They couldnt even take the skins off the jumbo shrimp! will never go back there again. the service was nice, but not enough to get me to go back there again. If you know what Authentic (which they claim they are) Mexican food taste like, then this place is no where close to it.  davis location

 Users/JuLuBeez

20090120 15:48:05 nbsp They are quite authentic IMHO.  Ive lived with a central Mexican family and am married to a Mexican.  You have to remember, just like the US, Mexico cuisine is regional.
As far as Im concerned their frijoles refritos, carne asada, and camarones are delicious, as well as all their salsas.  Their carne asada tastes just like my motherinlaws.  The Chuys platillo gives you a lot of food and is a good sampling of their meats.  You know a restaurant is authentic if they serve their dishes with rábanos.  Users/J8A

20090125 01:36:31 nbsp This place is my favorite for Mexican food in Davis. I try to get something different each time and I havent been disappointed yet. Honestly, Im just a sucker for their carne asada tacos and Coke in glass bottle.  Users/MichellePalmer

20090201 19:37:05 nbsp Great Winters CA taqueria, but they often run out of guacamole (A taqueria out of guacamole? Oh, my God.), and the shrimp are seriously mediocre.  Actually, they are really bad, NOT those fat, tasty Mexican gulf shrimp; theirs are probably from Indonesia (or worse).

We still eat there at least once a week (despite the pretentious Davis residents who are commonly present; but I must admit that some of you are nice).  Rellenos and carnitas.  Period.  Yum.  Ask (and please willingly pay) for additional crema. Wonderful staff/service...the Negra Modelo is especially recommended, a few of them will help you deal with us locals. Please enjoy your visit to Winters.   Users/wintersdude

20090223 13:01:41 nbsp Chile Verde burrito is great. I just get the regular one and it is still too big to eat in one meal. Users/LokiAbbi

20090316 21:07:20 nbsp Chuys is great!  Prices are modest, portions generous, ingredients fresh, fast service...but their meats are the highlight for me, especially carnitas and lengua.  Their tostada ceviche (shrimp) is REALLY good.  My new dessert habit...Mmmm. I eat at both stores, and theyre consistently good.  Winters has remodeled, the atmosphere is much more inviting for diners.  I almost feel funny passing through to pick up my Togo orders!  Davis retains its Taqueria Charm.  I recommend their nachos with carnitas, for starters. Users/Linda

20090316 23:05:41 nbsp I used to like Chuys because it was affordable, tasty, right down the street and had that kitschy Mexican charm. But they recently raised their prices to the point where going there is really not worth it anymore. This makes me sad because I like to support local familyowned businesses, but I dont see this one lasting much longer with these prices, particularly given its location. Also, the fact that its closed on Sundays is incredibly annoying. Users/jsogul

20090326 21:09:11 nbsp Fish tacos are very good, $2.99; Bigger than the regular meat ones and come with avocado. Users/vladthedestroyer

20090507 16:36:03 nbsp I have been meaning to check this place out for ages since I can walk to Westlake Plaza from my house. At first, I was put off because I didnt see any veggie options on the menu. However, I always ask a restaurant if they will make something for me, rather than just walking out. I ordered avocado tacos, and unlike ifoundthistape above, I actually asked the server if the beans were prepared with lard before I ordered them. She confirmed that they do contain lard, so veggies beware, and skip the beans. I sat down & enjoyed a reasonably priced Sol beer while I waited for the tacos. The server brought over some chips & salsa for me to munch on without me asking for them, which I thought was a nice gesture considering I was taking the food to go. The salsa was delicious and tasted fresh, with lots of cilantro. Yum! Needless to say, I polished off those chips! Added my own black beans at home, along with some of their salsa (which you can help yourself to & take some to go from the salsa bar), and our tacos were perfect. Ill definitely be walking over again when Im craving a cold cerveza & some fresh Mexican food. Users/AprilAries

20090519 17:47:00 nbsp Mmmmm tacos de lengua. Users/JenniferGiang

20090605 00:06:13 nbsp I was back through Davis recently for a wedding and I stopped at Chuys in Winters for lunch one afternoon. Theyve redecorated and the place was almost unrecognizable at first. Looks very nice though. The people are just as friendly as always, and the adobada tacos were still quite good. The fish taco I had, while tasty, was rather bland. Not sure if maybe I just went on an off day though. I hope they havent changed their seasonings for good. That would be quite the shame. Users/EricKlein

20091002 13:29:44 nbsp Chuys (in Davis) is the kind of restaurant you only go to if you live within walking distance. The prices here are higher than Davis Taqueria and Taqueria Guadalajara, the portions are smaller, and the food is not as good. Ive tried the regular burrito, taco salad, and regular tacos so far  all were decent, but just completely outdone by similar dishes at the other Mexican restaurants in town. Couple this with the fact that they are closed on Sundays, and really there is no reason to come here unless you live close by and dont want to drive anywhere else.  Users/JakeJames

20091111 11:18:19 nbsp The crispy taco is the tastiest, best lunch deal around. It is huge and delicious and very inexpensive. I also enjoy their Taco Salad with Adobada. Users/GJC02

20100824 16:47:22 nbsp Chile Rellenos are really really good.  I am picky about these as I make my own and I hate when you only taste the egg and not the chile or cheese.  Users/LokiAbbi

20100908 22:56:41 nbsp Chile relleno was swimming in grease, but that was probably because I ordered it togo without rice or beans on the side (for absorbency!). Went later and tried the breakfast burrito with huevos rancheros. I may never try anything else off their menu again, because those burritos are filling, reasonably priced, and goooooood (with the jalapenos and spicy salsa). Theres a bit of a wait, but thats a given for some solid Mexican food. Even the regularsized burrito could be halved and saved for later. Users/JaniceW

20100922 15:39:16 nbsp Very mediocre at best. Users/albinorolypoly
  Ehhh, I would describe them as extremely ok, most of the time. Users/JoePomidor

20110110 16:34:29 nbsp I have been here several times and so have many of my coworkers.  None of us have ever had a greasy relleno.  I would have sent it back because something definitley was not right. Users/LokiAbbi

20110420 17:51:04 nbsp I Love Chuys! They really have great food. YUMMY! Users/Sherri

20110723 16:35:47 nbsp Currently sitting at chuys enjoying my goto meal a super burrito. We live around the corner and I have to say Chuys is a gem to have nearby. The whole family enjoys coming, and the price is right. Users/meaghan

20110729 11:53:16 nbsp We tried this place out of convenience and feel we found a great place.  The ladies we encountered were friendly and accommodating.  Refreshing to be welcomed with a genuine smile.  The food was fabulously splurgeworthy.  I did not expect health food, but it was wholesome and comforting.  Prices are very reasonable.  The chicken taquitos melted in my mouth, as did the slightly spicycantstopeatingit salsa.  The guacamole was very good, too.  One of their burritos passed our table on its way to the next, and looked like it could feed a small family.  Next time well try the carnitas....stay tuned. Users/MrsC

20120607 20:29:50 nbsp Went here with some friends last week. The food is nice and comforting, but its a little expensive and not the best Mexican food Ive ever had. (Though apparently I may be spoiled in that regard, living in Los Angeles and all...) Service was pretty chill and the adobado is nice. Their salsa was thin and not very spicy.

Due to price and location, I see no reason to come here unless you live close by or its your convenient option. Taqueria Guadalajara beats Chuys, and Mariachi is even better I think for what it is. Plus I like their workers and owners better, and their amazing salsa bar. And their radishes. So happy they are there, you have no idea.

Not a bad place though, dont discount them. Plus I havent tried everything yet, but like I said, due to price and location Im not extremely likely to for another few months. Users/AlexTK

20120620 15:03:33 nbsp In Davis, I currently cant get enough of their large nachos with chicken. They are perfect on a hot day! I think they are a buck cheaper on either Wednesday or Thursday when it is the daily special. The super chicken burrito is my next favorite. The super burrito is pretty big and half of it plus chips makes a filling meal (save the second half for your next meal)!Their carnitas are either a hit or a miss. When they are good they are excellent. When it is an off day, they are much too dry. Not wanting to gamble, I stick with the chicken as it is consistently juicy and has good flavor. Their breakfast burritos are very yummy and would make a nice Sunday breakfast if they were open on Sundays sad face. Users/Wldrangel

20130811 18:39:52 nbsp The Davis restaurant has the best fish tacos Ive ever had.  Their fish burrito is also good. Users/TeresaKing

20140115 22:41:38 nbsp Just had their Carnitas Soft Tacos, Authentic and Delicious.  Very affordable too!!! Users/GMoney

20140125 18:57:23 nbsp This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Davis.  Ive said it before here, but it is worth mentioning again  they have the BEST fish tacos Ive ever had.  Also, great staff and very affordable.

20140211 19:36:44 nbsp This is my First ever review of anything online. Im normally a review freeloader who never gives anything back. However, after being convinced to go from the last reviewer who loved their fish tacos, I decided to go. Place is mediocre at best with horribly cheap carne asada and past frozen fish. Guadalajara  taqueria is much better in my opinion. Users/Maximus
