Cindys is a dinerstyle restaurant in South Davis, with similar food to Dennys.  It has distinct 60s/70sera style decor and a funky roof shaped like an imploding range hood.  The best meal there is breakfast and brunch, but lunch (shared with Kow Thai) is also fine, and prices are reasonable. It doesnt stand out much and is relatively far from campus, and is relatively cheap.

Cindys is one of the best, cheap, little breakfast places in town!  Try their biscuits and gravy, although their pancake or waffle specials are also very decent.

Kow Thai Restaurant (formerly, Thai Dynamite) operates in this location serving Thai restaurants Thai food for lunch and dinner.

My food experience at Cindys is less than stellar.  I found their food to be extremely bland, with an odd texture.  Service was OK. Users/PaulLanzi

I had a pretty good Breakfast breakfast here.  Diner food, but the place is cozy. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050202 11:41:05 nbsp The cinnamon rolls are the best and biggest I have ever seen Users/MyaBrn

20050210 12:18:51 nbsp Whatever you do ... dont get the Monty Cristo. More like the Mound of Crisco ... Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050302 18:23:59 nbsp Very good service here.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice, although expensive, is quite good, and you get to watch them squeeze it. Users/JaimeRaba

20050302 18:34:11 nbsp For your standard breakfast fare, Cindys is great! Two eggs, over easy with toast and hash browns. What I appreciate most is that the place is old school diner and it doesnt aspire to more, like many other Davis diners. Users/AlphaDog

20050302 19:28:58 nbsp Yeah, I think if I had to rank places to have an American style breakfast in Davis:  #1 Cindys #2 Bernardo #3 Cafe Italia  #4 Bakers Square #5 IHOP #6 Abes Users/JaimeRaba

20050302 19:29:37 nbsp What IS a Monte Cristo anyway? Users/JaimeRaba

20050302 19:37:22 nbsp Wow! That Monte Cristo Sandwiches Monte Cristo sounds great!! I think it may become my new late Saturday breakfast. Users/AlphaDog

20050302 21:37:18 nbsp Monte Cristos are awesome, but not at Cindys. Theyre supposed to be pan fried in butter, as the recipe above suggests. This makes the bread crisp and yummy. Cindys deep fries it. Think about it two pieces of bread, dipped in egg, and deep fried in the same vat they cook the fish sticks in. Not only does deep fry oil infuse the bread, but pockets of oil also get caught in between the slices of ham. A tablespoon of mustard or mayo is nice inside a sandwich, but a tablespoon of hot oil does not a happy tongue make. :(  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050813 10:56:48 nbsp The pancakes are very good here.  The place is always busy on the weekends, and the selection of food isnt wonderful, but everything I have tried has been tasty.  As mentioned above, the cinnamon rolls are awesome. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050813 10:59:13 nbsp I thought the place was alright. I dont remember what I had; i just remembered it was really oily. Water tasted a bit gross/warm. Service was really friendly tho.   Users/EdWins ES

20050829 16:03:45 nbsp This is by far the best breakfast place around. Their eggs benedict are fantastic, the sauce is not out of a box. Theyll make omelettes to your specification without charging extra or getting snippy about it. Their salsa is also pretty good, I like it on my fries! Users/StarRuiz

20050829 16:38:29 nbsp Star, have you been to Delta of Venus Delta? Users/ArlenAbraham
      Delta is great if you like long lines, busing your own table, and elitist COFFEHOUSE employees staring down their nose at you...

20050902 11:38:19 nbsp THIS IS NOT LIKE DENNYS. Users/HeatherKlinger

20050902 14:51:47 nbsp I used to go there maybe once a month.  I would get an omelette every time.  A year or so ago they raised their prices and started giving you less food (no more pancakes with your omelette).  I havent been back since. Users/NikolaiBraun

20050903 10:17:50 nbsp You know, Deltas breakfasts are as good as they used to be... just my jaded opinion. Users/JaimeRaba

20051107 19:17:38 nbsp Cindys makes delicious pancakes! Users/JohnDudek

20051216 09:45:56 nbsp The food here was not great, not even good.  But the malts and shakes are awesome D Just ask your waitress because they can make all different types (not listed on the menu). Users/JoAnnaRich

20060224 09:48:25 nbsp I like Cindys but theres usually a long wait for a table on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  And since Abes closed up the street Cindys is busier all the time. Users/SteveGreen

20060306 13:06:46 nbsp It is awesome!  Omelette + cinnamon roll  delicious!  They served folgers coffee though..bleh Users/QuynhNhuNguyen

20060306 13:13:53 nbsp What Davis needs is a new Dennys.   Theyd make bank. Users/JaimeRaba
  Or Carrows / Lyons / 24hr Diner Users/TarZxf
  The odd thing is that 24hour places always seem to fold in Davis. Its a total mystery to me how a college town can be totally devoid of allnight study/eatery places, and kill off any that come. Its like Davis is the only college town ever where the students almost all go to bed at midnight. Users/EricKlein
    If its 24 hours out on Mace Blvd it wouldnt last because theyre so far from the majority of the student population.  Who would want to travel across town at 4am?  Id rather just travel to downtown.  Users/JoAnnaRich JR
     I agree, but even downtown 24 hour places seem to close quickly (or never form in the first place). Users/EricKlein

20060331 11:42:43 nbsp The service wasnt spectacular.  The price was right for the amount of food (I think the combo is the best value).  The food tastes good, but it isnt anything to write home about.  The kiddie drawings near the entrance are fun to look at.  :) Users/JennaChan

20061108 22:34:47 nbsp Excellent food for the price! I love the huevos rancheros here. The salsa here is homemade and fresh and the workers are nice. The service isnt the best but its a diner so they dont have a whole lot to take care of. Being nice is good enough, I think. Same goes for the owner. Good guy, it seems. Users/LiRic

20070413 15:04:45 nbsp Your typical greasyspoon, but what a great greasyspoon it is! Great place to go for breakfast after a night out. Food comes out fast and the service is efficient. Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070414 07:35:55 nbsp Did their hours change a while back? I could swear I came here for dinner once three or four years ago.  Users/ElleWeber

20070524 23:08:42 nbsp Yes there hours are only opened until 3pm. For those who like fresh food..like REAL turkey in their sandwiches..then this is the place for you. They have the best salads, the best blue cheese dressing, the best turkey bacon melt, and crinkle french fries. Everything is homemade here... even the soup! The wait on the weekends can range from 10 30 mins but that must tell you something... it is worth waiting for and if it is crowdd it must be good. The owner of this place was so nice and recently passed away... but the place still is owned by the same family and still has that great charm. If you go often they get to know you and wll go the extra mile for you. Very sweet waitresses. Users/gina

20070716 22:19:23 nbsp I like eat at cindys me caveman me like food on bone good food at cindys even a caveman like i do me like Users/dickjones

20070801 13:49:28 nbsp I had a great time the first time I went to cindys for breakfast enjoying the works skillet with almost everything in it(great ingredients, quick service. I will say that their drinks were dissapointing(apple juice was terrible and replacement orange juice was just ok, too much pulp for my liking) will be going back soon to try out lunch  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20070803 15:35:57 nbsp It is good food at times i like the cook that has been there for many years, i also like the vintage feel this place gives i will gladly eat here again Users/Brians

20071117 17:44:55 nbsp Dennys has been in Davis, like two or three times. It was where Abes was. Why it kept folding, I have no idea other than terrible location. Seasons used to be a Lyons. Great location, right across from the theater. I KNOW why Lyons went out of business. It consistently, and I mean year in and year out, had the worst service of any place I have ever seen. You could be in a wheel chair with two broken arms and seat yourself, set the table, cook the food, bring yourself drinks... faster than the staff there.

Now Cindys is a little scary. I was the skinniest person in there by about 200 pounds. The breakfast was okay. But the bimbo waitress served the rich looking skier types (Ill bet he tips good) way faster than they served us. Lunches though... grease bomb. Even the coffee was greasy. The seats were a little sticky... Oh cinnamon rolls...Village Bakery, bar none! Users/LouisM

20080107 13:53:44 nbsp Food is ok but like most coffee shops from the past greese is the word. Users/LongtimeDavisite

20080422 18:07:54 nbsp I was wondering around the wiki today and I was stoked to discover that there is a place in Davis to get a Monte Cristo sandwich! Users/RodneyBlackwell

20080511 11:31:24 nbsp Cindys really is the best place in town to grab a hearty breakfast.  The service has alway been decent, even when theyre busy.  Their omlettes are awesome, great selection of stuff to put in yours if you want to build your own.  Cindys skillets are pretty good too!!!  My only complaint would be the coffee...skip the coffee, and go with the fresh squeezed OJ or grapefruit juice.  Their cinnamon rolls are HUGE!!!, and always fresh! Who needs restaraunt chains when you have a real good local place....they even honor the regular customers with drawings in the entrance. Users/JasonA

20081102 12:50:22 nbsp Made the trip to Cindys today for a great breakfast.  It had been too long since I visited this place.  While a greasy spoon type atmosphere, the owner is always on site, the servers are friendly and the foot is consistently warm and sits well in my tummy.  Three in my party today and everyone was totally satisfied.  in an era where so many new places try to be unique, fancy and ultimately overpriced, Cindys is a rock solid choice that is becoming harder to find.   Users/loneshark

20081103 20:13:07 nbsp Best hangover food around. Users/Selby

20090223 10:04:07 nbsp We went to Cindys last night, and they are now a Thai restaurant in the evenings. Breakfast and lunch are still traditional Cindys fare.
Incidentially, it was really really good food. We ordered Pad Thai and Jungle Curry. They were both outstanding. In fact, it was the best Pad Thai I have had in a long time. The restaurant was a bit chilly (probably a money saver), but bring a jacket and youll be fine. New best Thai food in Davis, in my opinion.  Users/jillerbean

20090727 18:04:13 nbsp Food: confused  mix of American, Mexican, & even Asian
Tasteness: not the best
Service: depends on who you get  Ive received friendlywelcoming faces to I am tired and what do you want?
Would I return: No.  There are other places w/ better eats and prices (better location, also)
Rating: 4/10 Users/FoodGloriousFood

20090809 21:52:56 nbsp Never coming back to Cindys. Bad, greasy food; poor, slow service; overrated. I went there for the first time for Saturday breakfast after reading all the positive reviews on Davis Wiki. Sadly, the experience was nowhere near the reviews. First, it took 15min after getting seated to get our coffee, which we were never offered refills for because the waitress never came to check. When the food arrived, it looked and tasted like a depository for excess grease and was bland and uneventful. Of all things to screw up, I always thought breakfast was foolproof...Not true apparently. Everytime we needed service (and mind you we had a small party of two only), I had to go up to the front diner for service  three times! Each time, somebody other than our waitress would say, shell send someone over. LIES! Bottom line: we are never coming back to Cindys. That one and only negative experience was enough to seal the deal forever.  Users/kenika1226

Considering all the positive reviews about this place, it looks like you just had a bad day.

20091012 17:24:44 nbsp I love their Thai food! best in town! Ive been there for breakfast and swore I would never come again. But a friend told me that there Thai night was the best he ever had. So, I went since Ive been to every Thai place in Davis too many times already. We had the angel wings, thai green curry and pad thai...everything was great! Users/MinhTran

20100504 14:54:41 nbsp Please correct the timings, I visited Cindys at 5:10 am today (Tuesday) and it remained closed till 6 am. Users/scrizer

20100603 16:41:10 nbsp its a little pricy but its yummy. my housemate and i went there couple months back and service was great! just when the bill came.. a little wow.  Users/Hollen

20101017 14:35:44 nbsp Ive had breakfast at Cindys twice in the last week and found the service and food to be very good. My server, Courtney, has worked
there for several years and really knows the menu. I like the pancake combo and oatmeal with peaches and strawberries and appreciate the
teamwork. When Courtney was busy taking or delivering an order to someone else. another server would check to see if I wanted more
coffee. I understand that Cindys has changed ownership three times in the past few years. I wouldnt pay much attention to old reviews
because the current team, including the cooks, is doing a good job.
  Users/nowhereman


Thanks for the kind words ;)Users/CourtneyJones

20101017 16:34:12 nbsp Anyone know if theyve fixed the seats there?  The booths are terrible.  I got splinters in my leg sitting down and sliding into the booth once, and another person in my party once badly pinched her hand when the seat shifted while she was sliding in (it drew blood... which is really painful from a pinch).  I absolutely love the breakfasts here (especially the cinnamon buns), but I havent been in at least 6 months, and am always a little nervous about going because of the high chance of injury. Users/TomGarberson
 You have got to be kidding me right? Your chances of injury are all selfinflicted. Do you actually know how easy it is to go to a restaurant, sit down, and NOT get splinters? Stop being a little crybaby beezy and man the f up. Complaining about a restaurant cuz it gave you a splinter and pinched your skin when you shifted your seat? speechlessUsers/Kafani
   Ahh, right.  How dare I expect a business to repair its seating once it starts breaking and hurting customers.  Ill call up the owner of Cindys right away and apologize personally. tg
   (sarcasm on) Geez Tom...Im ashamed of you (sarcasm off)in all seriousness when you patronize a restaurant you should expect, IMHO, in the least, comfortable seating. Ill be in Davis for a few days shortly and may hit Cindys. As to KafaniIve been going to restaurants for 41 years and no splinters yet because a restaurant that doesnt take care of its facility shows little respect for its customers. PeteB


Hey everyone, I actually work at Cindys and wanted to apologise personally for you getting splinters or your fingers pinched.  I know out bbooths are indeed in need of repair as our whole restaurant is kinda old.  I wanted to inform you that we are in the process of remodling aand the booths are on the list of things we are planning on replacing.  We do care about our customers comfort.  We have tried to repair the old booths time and time again and decided to just replace them all together.  We are doing things gradually but will definately get to that.  :) as for now you could always sit at a table if you didnt want to take the risk ;)  Anyway sorry againUsers/CourtneyJones

20110428 17:22:34 nbsp PLEASE post a togo menu.  Not only are you losing business, but irritating potential customers.

Its simple  scan your menu, upload it  viola. Users/Marshall

20110430 21:38:42 nbsp The breakfasts are amazing, the Thai food is awesome, and the burgers and fries Yummmmy! Users/Sherri

20110430 21:40:45 nbsp Oh, BTW did you know they serve Thai during lunch now? Users/Sherri

20111010 12:30:54 nbsp Davis needed another Thai restaurant? Wow.  Cindys has been around as long as I can remember... at least back to the mid70s.  It just blows me away that instead of having 2 old school type American restaurants in town (see Black Bear Diner), Davis now basically has  1 1/3.  And 100 Thai places. Users/OldDavis73
   Hey, OldDavis73, your moniker reminds me of a tragic old bluegrass song, Wreck of the Ol 97. As far as Cindys, have you eaten there lately?    Users/RaoulDuke
    Hey Raoul(Duke), wow, cool... I cant say I know that one, but the fact that my username could somehow be associated with an older tragic bluegrass song is enjoyable.  To be honest, I havent eaten at Cindys in over 25 years.  Still, its comforting to still see the sign every day as I commute back and forth to Sac.  Its a reminder of my childhood, with the sign (and the building) looking just as it did.

20111203 18:10:54 nbsp Real good food, and great service. Very consistent for as long as its been around. I like this place a lot. Users/Theangrydiner

20120202 12:19:29 nbsp Went to Cindys in the evening when it turns into the Thai restaurant.  Surprisingly delicious.  We usually go to Taste of Thai, but thought of trying this place out base on its review & the consideration that authentic thai is usually not favored by the general population due to the unusual spice and ingredients not common in most area areas.  We got green curry with the choice of squid(I think it was number 37 or one of the other numbers above it).  The culmination of spice, bamboo & green beans were delicious in a way that was exciting and familiar, sort of reminded me of home cook thai food.  The second dish we got was red duck curry, which also has a nice taste & balance to the coconuty base.  The servers were very nice, really good customer service, despite the longer wait, but I suppose they want to give you enough time to look over the menue & the thai tea had unlimited refill, which is a plus.  I found it just right, not too sweet. Users/kikao

20130726 16:35:55 nbsp Recently they starting offering their American food options for dinner as well as Thai.  Weve been here several times over the years.  Always the same employee there to greet us and seat us when we come in.  He always has an earpiece on his ear.  He is very friendly and practically sits in the booth with us before our food arrives.  Many of the items on the menu claim to be homemade and employees seem to be proud of the meals their serving.  The food is good and the prices are cheap, but its usually fairly empty when weve been (mostly in the evenings).  It has a very comfortable atmosphere.  Without fail some older person will come in and the employee will know their order by heart.  Classic.  We are happy to have them in southeast Davis.   Users/JSilva
