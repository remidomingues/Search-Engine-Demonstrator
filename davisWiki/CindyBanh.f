Cindy Banh is a second year Political Science and English double major. She likes lots of coffee (2 sugars, no cream). And movies. Lots of movies. Her perfect day would consist of a James Bond, Star Wars, or Rambo marathon while eating massive amounts of chocolate.

Cindy Banh can be spotted running around downtown doing errands for her boss. Like passing out fliers to harried soccer moms about nuclear proliferation.
