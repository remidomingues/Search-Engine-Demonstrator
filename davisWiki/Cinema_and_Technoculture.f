The Technocultural Studies and Film Studies programs have been informed by Michael Neff and Kriss Ravetto (CoDirectors of Cinema and Technoculture) that Cinema and Technoculture (CTC) is currently under review to become a new major at UC Davis.  The curriculum for CTC will merge the previous majors of Technocultural Studies and Film Studies, and will also add entirely new courses to the curriculum, which can be found http://arts.ucdavis.edu/cinemaandtechnoculturalstudiescurriculum here.
