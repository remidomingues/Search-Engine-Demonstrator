About Circle K International

Circle K International is the largest collegiate Volunteer Opportunities community service, leadership development, and friendship organization in the world. Circle K clubs are organized and sponsored by a Kiwanis club on a college or university campus. It is a selfgoverning organization and elects its own officers, conducts its own meetings, and determines its own service activities. They are unrelated to the Circle K other wiki:WikiPedia:Alimentation CoucheTard international wiki:WikiPedia:Circle K organization in Davis.

Circle K is an international community service organization with over 12,600 members worldwide in 18 Nations. Circle K blends community service and leadership training with the opportunity to meet many other college students at service projects, conferences, and conventions.

Each club works closely with their school and local community in planning and implementing projects that best serve the needs of that particular area. Clubs within the same basic geographic area (divisions), also work together on larger projects. On the district level, Our clubs works within the boundaries of California, Nevada, and Hawaii to achieve common goals and service initiatives, coming together at conferences, conventions, and large scale projects (see events page). This gives members the opportunity to work closely with and get to know many different people, not just those at their own school.

Circle K International is the collegiate branch of wiki:WikiPedia:Kiwanis International. UC Davis CKI is sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Greater Davis and is affiliated with Key Club at the high school level.

UC Davis Circle K was chartered on April 5, 1974 and remains one of the oldest Circle K clubs in the CaliforniaNevadaHawaii District.  Currently, there are 88 paid members in the club.  Club members are involved with all types of service, including working with children, the elderly, and homeless.  The club also works with other organizations on campus and in the community, including SHARE with New Orleans, Woodland YMCA, Food Bank of Yolo County Yolo County Food Bank, Davis Community Meals, Shriners Hospital, and more.

New members are welcome to join any time during the year!  We do service yearround, because service never sleeps!  If youre around in the summer and want to be a part of our club, come to one of our meetings to find out more about upcoming summer events.

Board of Officers

Circle K International has an executive board (better known as EBoard) and an appointed board (aka ABoard). EBoard consists of the President, the Administrative Vice President, the Service Vice President, the Secretary, and the Treasurer.

In order to be on EBoard, you must be nominated by a fellow member then elected by the duespaid members. This process happens every year around February before District Convention (DCon) as the EBoard will go through numerous workshops at DCon, meeting fellow EBoard members from other CKI schools, thus bettering their ability and leadership in running a club.

Once all of EBoard is selected, so begins the appointing of more board members  the ABoard!

It is up to EBoard to choose what ABoard positions should be available to the public of the club. The potential ABoard members will then fill out applications of what ABoard position they so dearly desire and be interviewed by the totality of the EBoard. Once all the adequate ABoard positions are filled, so begins another wonderful year for Circle K International.

(Sidenote: To be on board you must be a duespaid member)
