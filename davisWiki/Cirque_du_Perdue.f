Cirque des Perdue is a Changeling: The Lost LARP (Live Action Roleplaying Games Role Play) that meets every other Friday in the Death Star running concurrently with DRAGON, the oncampus gaming club.

Players play the Lost, escaped servants of the wonderous and terrifying Fae, who have returned home only to find that the world has moved on without them since their abduction.  Together, they struck out for new lives, living by the rules of the Road and the Rings, bringing entertainment to those they met in their travelling circus.  But the Wild Hunt can never be far behind, and the threats of the human world are not to be ignored either; the circus has fallen, and now the survivors have formed a new home in Bellingham, Washington.

In English, its a group of people acting out characters of their own making, humans kidnapped by mystical creatures and warped into something mystical themselves, now escaping and trying to survive in a world that has truly forgotten them, running still from their erstwhile captors who want their playthings back. It runs on Minds Eye Theatre, which uses D10 (so all you need to play is a die or some playing cards). New players are always welcome, and rules can be taught as the game is learned firsthand.
