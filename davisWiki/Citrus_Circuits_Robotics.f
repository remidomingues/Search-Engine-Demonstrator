FRC Team 1678, Citrus Circuits Robotics, a FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics team, was founded as EnGen Robotics in 2004 by Steve Harvey, a math teacher at DaVinci High School in Davis, CA. In 2007, the name was changed to Citrus Circuits. Since its inception seven years ago, the team has grown to include high school students from Woodland Christian, DaVinci High School, and Davis Senior High School. In the future, Citrus Circuits hopes to expand our team and reach out to elementary schoolaged children in our community by establishing a FIRST Jr. Lego League division of the Citrus Circuits.

Citrus Circuits takes part in the FIRST Robotics Competition. They help give high school students experience in the fields of robotics and engineering. They compete each year in the Sacramento regionals for the annual FIRST Robotics Competition. For more information on the team and their robots, visit their website http://www.citruscircuits.org  Citrus Circuits.

 To Support 

 Become a Sponsor 
This option is for businesses and corporations. The expenses most years are generally around $10,000, and likely to go up this season because they plan to compete in two regionals, something they have always wanted to do but never had the funds. Add to this unexpected expenses like going to the Championships, and the team is almost always in need of funding and sponsors. If your company is interested in sponsoring through things like money, parts, mentors feel free to contact Citrus Circuits at frc1678@gmail.com. Theyll be happy to add you as a sponsor and to see your logo on their tshirts next year.
