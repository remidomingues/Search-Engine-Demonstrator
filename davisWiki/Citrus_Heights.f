Theres shopping at the http://www.sunrisemallonline.com/ Sunrise Mall, which is smaller than the http://westfield.com/galleriaatroseville/ Roseville Galleria or Arden Fair Mall, and features many stores which can be found closer to Davis.  One benefit of going to Sunrise over Arden is the strip mall across the street, Sunrise Boulevard, that contains http://www.offbroadwayshoes.com/ Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse, http://www.ulta.com/ulta/ ULTA, and a http://www.barnesandnoble.com/ Barnes & Noble.  Across the other street, Greenback Lane, is an http://www.oldnavy.com/ Old Navy and a http://www.bevmo.com/ BevMo.

Until September 2007 there was a http://krispykreme.com/ Krispy Kreme Doughnuts here, but that became one more victim of corporate overexpansion and and closed many outlets, as did http://www.mrsfields.com/ Mrs. Fields Cookies.  If youre a tennis fan, the Sacramento Capitals team makes its home at the mall during the summers, which is cool if you want some signatures or to meet a team.

And theres a http://www.benihana.com/ Benihana, the closest location to Davis for those fans of teppanyaki style cooking, who want shrimp and food thrown at you and knives juggled.

Locals frequent call Citrus Heights The Heights, with a strong inflection on the Heights.
