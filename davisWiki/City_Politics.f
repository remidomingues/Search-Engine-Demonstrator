 Political Characterizations 
Please read the truly excellent short ebook by Mike Fitch, http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pb/cultural/30years/toc.cfm Growing Pains: Thirty Years in the History of Davis for a great overview of Davis political history.

 Progressive 
Davis is known worldwide. Some of that characterization is seen as progressive. Global media attention has come to Davis for such zany Progressive things as Toad Tunnel, issuing noise violation noise violations for Snoring, and our Potholes historic potholes. Although not as overtly as UC Berkeley Berkeley, Davis carries the environmental torch in practical and subtle ways: Bicycles, Unitrans Hydrogen and Natural Gas Buses, Environmental Research, Recycling recycling, Village Homes and The CoOp Organic Living. When Julie Partansky was first running for a seat on the Davis City Council, she suggested that fruit trees should be planted throughout the city, so that homeless people could forage. Every year the Whole Earth Festival is also celebrated on Motherâ€™s Day weekend... a selfproclaimed testament to alternative living, foods, music, and politics. Also see Peoples Republic of Davis.

Between 20012003 the Davis College Democrats were not very active due to the actions of a former club president, Igor Berman, who left the club to become an officer in the Davis College Republicans.

 Moderate 
The battle between developers and slow or nogrowthers seems to keep getting more heated every election. The 2004 race where Mike Harrington was accused of taking developer money is an example. The fun part was that his accusers were rivals of the developer who allegedly gave him money. Davis politicians can be stereotyped into two archetypes, which are based on actual politicians. There are the Julie Partansky or Sue Greenwald types and the Don Saylor or Lois Wolk types. Julie and Sue (as well as Lamar Heystek) represent the progressive left: slow or no growth; sometimes renters; values similar to many hippies; while Don and Lois represent the liberal to moderate centrists of Davis, who have tended to approve new housing and commercial projects.
  (A lot can be said here about the political dynamics in Davis and the relative strengths and distinctions between progressive, moderate, and conservative forces.  For instance, there is a socalled developer democrat power structure that serves as a machine to bring people up from the school board, to the city council, to the county board of supervisors, and eventually on to the State Assembly and State Senate.  Most importantly, there is a distinction between true progressiveness and a predominant veneer of progressiveness that I hope will be respected in this page as it develops. cj ) 

 Conservative 
Although progressive as previously stated, Davis is home to a small number of conservatives. Some of this comes from the central valley location, although a segment of student population is also conservative. Davis in recent years has become a bit of a commuter home to professionals from Sacramento and other surrounding cities, broadening the political views.

The honor guard of conservative politics is Davis College Republicans, who make some pretty daredevil political statements that everyone notices. The conflict between conservative and progressive politics leads to many protests in the city and the campus.

 Representatives 
 City Officials 
City Council The Davis City Council has five members who each serve a four year term. They are elected atlarge, two and three at a time in the primary election occurring in evennumbered years. The council meets in open session at the City Council Chambers. Council meetings often run late, and the agenda often gets rearranged at the last minute if an item is expected to garner a lot of public comment... bring a book and something to eat. Council meetings are aired on City Government Channel (Comcast Channel 16).

The mayor is selected internally by the council. Traditionally, the top votegetter at the most recent election is chosen.  The person chosen then serves two years as mayor protem before taking office. Mayors in Davis do not have additional power, but run city council meetings and serve a ceremonial role at community events.

The City of Davis has about 25 http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/ task forces, commissions, and committees that are open to varying degrees of public involvement. Many of these can be applied for, and then the City Council selects the members. For important commissions, the members to be chosen can be invited to apply rather than being invited after applying.
