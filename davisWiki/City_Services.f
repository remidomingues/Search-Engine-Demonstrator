Urban Legends Legend has it that Davis was the first city to have curbside recycling pickup. While thats not quite true, Davis was an early adopter of curbside recycling. Madison, Wisconsin started curbside recycling in 1967, and just seven years later, Davis started its own program in 1974 (http://www.dwrco.com/body_recycling.htm Source)  Being the progressive city that it is, you can pay the fees (quite high, actually) http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/payment/ online.
