The municipal government for Davis. The bureaucratic infrastructure of the city is run by the city manager and his staff, and it and city services are governed by the City Council. See City Services or their http://www.city.davis.ca.us/misc/AtoZ.cfm A to Z guide to city services for a better idea about what they do. Our city has numerous Sister Cities around the world.

The UC Davis University of California, Davis is not incorporated into the City of Davis, which means that Freshmen and those who live in Student Housing OnCampus Housing are not eligible to vote in city elections.  There is often conflict between the City and the University about the direction of Davis, especially in terms of the growth rate.  However, the City must adjust as the University continues to expand in the coming years.

The city is a part of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments.


 History 
The city was incorporated in 1917 after a Fire of 1916 fire devastated the town, highlighting the need for municipal services such as a Fire Department.
