Clam chowder (known as clam chowda in the Boston area) comes in two popular varieties, New England (which is cream based) and Manhattan (which is tomato based).  Most of the clam chowder in these parts is of the New England variety.  If you like clam chowder, here are a few places in Davis where you can get some:
