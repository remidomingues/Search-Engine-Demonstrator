Address(Clara Lane) is a branch off of Birch Lane that overlooks the intersection of Pole Line Road and Loyola Drive.

Some of the houses are quite interesting and obviously predate the rest of the neighborhood. Children use this street to bicycle to Birch Lane School Birch Lane Elementary School as there is little car traffic.

##Still need photo of the street
