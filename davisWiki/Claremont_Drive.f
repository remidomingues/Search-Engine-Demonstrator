Address(Claremont Drive) separates the residential Neighborhoods neighborhood on its south side from Oak Tree Plaza on its north.   It is part of the college streets in the town street name themes.

On April 25 & 26, 2013, this street lost most of its Street Trees, as part of PG&Es http://www.pgecurrents.com/2013/03/07/inhonorofcaliforniaarbordaypgesays“planttherighttreeintherightplace”/ Right Trees, Right Place program. The trees have been deformed by years of trimming by power company contractors, to keep them from growing into power lines; PG&E successfully argued that the trees are now in poor shape, and so they will be replaced with new trees that grow to lower heights, replacing a mature canopy with what, for a decade, will be a paltry imitation.
