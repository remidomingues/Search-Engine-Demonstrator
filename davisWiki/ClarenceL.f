A brief guide on how to format links and so forth should be at the bottom of the editing window.  And once again, Welcome to the wiki welcome. Users/MasonMurray
 Thats close, but for a link within the wiki, we can trim the whole URL bit, and if you put quotes you can trim a bit more.  If you hit the Info button, you can see what I did.

20100802 09:14:50 nbsp No need to explain why youre creating a new page in the actual content.  Creating new pages is inherently a cool thing to do.  Nice catch on the Medical Sciences Building! Users/JabberWokky

20101201 16:55:50 nbsp Thanks for the information on {{{Theta Xi/Talk}}}.  Do you happen to know anything about it, or whether it might be more than rumor.
