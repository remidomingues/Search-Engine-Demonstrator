This is a great drinking games drinking game for the bored student looking to spice up their daily lecture, or for a smart ass student that doesnt need to pay attention during lecture.

Games can vary. For example, if you have any class in Biology, you can drink every time the teacher says cell or in Spanish every time the maestra says que or como... and you are guaranteed to come stumbling out of lecture.
