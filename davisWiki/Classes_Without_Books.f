 ||<tablewidth95% 4> Classes With Required Books That Are Never Mentioned or You Really Dont Need||
 ||<rowbgcolor#CCCCFF :15%>Class||<:20%>Professor||<:15%>As Of||<:70%>Comments||
 ||BIS 102||Steve Theg, Ken Hilt||Winter 2008||The books are required only to keep them stocked in the bookstore.  All books are optional and are on reserves as well. ||
 ||CHE 105||Ting Gou||Spring 2008||The book (Stoog, Principles of Instrument Analysis), isnt very useful, it isnt very used, really it just makes a 180 dollar (used) reference for your lab reports. /!\ Warning: the book is also used for CHE 115 and 125.||
 ||ECS 010||Dean Sniegowski||Spring 2006||Like ECS 30 below, you can buy the book but you dont have to. Just dont miss lecture.||
 ||ECS 030||Dean Sniegowski, Sean Davis||Winter 2006||There is a required book, however you learn everything you need to know in lecture.  It makes a good reference, though.||
 ||FST 010 ||Gerry Russell||Winter 2007||Only the extra credit questions are pulled from the text, something he tells you up front||

 ||<rowbgcolor#CCCCFF :15%>Class||<:20%>Professor||<:15%>As Of||<:70%>Comments||
 ||ANS 042||Anita Oberbauer||Winter 2006||Recommended book in syllabus, but she never mentioned it in class.  You dont Really need it.||
 ||ENG 006||Larry Lagerstrom||Winter 2006||The only thing you really need for this class are the course notes, which are available for free online in PDF form. There is a recommended reference book, but you really dont need it.||
 ||GEL 12||Sandy Carlson||Winter 2006||There is a book, but she actually said on the first day of class that you dont need to buy it.||
 ||NPB 12||Gregg Recanzone||Fall 2006||There is a recommended book, but (as he explains in the first lecture) it isnt broad enough to cover everything in the course.  Instead, just print out/read his lecture notes and powerpoint slides beforehand, and youll be fine!||

 ||<rowbgcolor#CCCCFF :15%>Class||<:20%>Professor||<:15%>As Of||<:70%>Comments||
 ||BIS 103||Oliver Fiehn||Winter 2006||The reader is actually every single powerpoint slide he shows in lecture.  It isnt in exact order (he sometimes changes his mind) but it helps to have them all preprinted and bound.  They are also available on his website in the order displayed in lecture.||
 ||EEC 130B||Andr√© Knoessen||Spring 2008||This prof has written his own excellent course notes that are pretty much a textbook. He gives you the PDF for free, but there is still the option of getting them printed out at Kinkos for $22. Fun class overall for electrical engineering majors.||
 ||EXB 010||Shaffrath/Salitsky||Fall 2006||Fun and easy class, but you need to attend for it to remain easy.||
 ||MIC 102L||Mann||Spring 2006||Just a cheap, unbound lab manual. ||
