There are several classes that could be considered the epitome of UC Davis:

 Is it just wl me, or has this list gone beyond what it was intended to be? Im not sure HDE 12, HIS 111, or MUS 106 can be considered uniquely representative of UC Davis. HDE 12 and HIS 111, for example, could be found in almost any college in this country.

  No its not just you; for the love of god, please delete them!
  What makes His 111 unique is not the material but the man. Stylianos Spyridakis is a legend.
   I agree.  This should be a list of notable, rather than unique, UCD classes.  I doubt there are many (any?) courses with truly unique content.  HIS 111 is absolutely classic when Spiro teaches it. Users/JonathanLawton
     Then maybe we should note that in the table? Users/hankim
      yep, then it would at least make some sense.  Users/ScottMeehleib
