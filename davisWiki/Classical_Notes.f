Classical Notes is an ASUCD unit that will pay you to take notes for a class. These notes are then photocopied and made available to students as a subscription or individually by lecture. Students may also buy these notes on the classical notes website and view them online. These notes come in handy when you miss a lecture and dont know anyone in the class that you can get the notes from. Classical notes shares windowspace with Campus Copies
