Classical Studies Association (also known as CSA) is a social club at UC Davis focused on creating a friendly community of people with an interest in the ancient Mediterranean world. Most members of CSA are Classics majors and study the languages of ancient Greek and Latin. However, students of all areas are welcome to join, as the club unites those of various majors, currently ranging from History to Microbiology and also including English, Psychology, Music, PreVeterianary Sciences, and Film Studies.

Activities
Art Competitions
CSA holds visual art contests whenever the need arises. This includes the annual TShirt Design Contest! Bookplate Design Contests are also held when books are donated to the Classics Library on the 7th floor of Sproul Hall.

TShirt Design Contest 1213 Rules:
1) The design can be anything Classicsrelated! BE CREATIVE.
2) Design ideas could be BUT are not limited to: the Greek gods playing poker together (as discussed at the last club meeting), the Shield of Achilles, or Troy Story. Also, the Trojan Horse is this years CSA Picnic Day theme.
Past sample entries can be found here: http://magikarparmy.deviantart.com/gallery/28989864#/d4kwrfj   http://sakurabelle.deviantart.com/#/d5ru6yc
3) The design must say Classical Studies Association and 20122013 on it somewhere.
4) The design must be clean and appropriate. Itll be a UCD shirt, so lets keep it respectable and classy.
5) The design must be your own art. Be original and respectful with your drawing and/or editing skills! No art theft, or we wont be able to print the design.
6) Feel free to use colors in your design! But remember that more colors means a higher cost, so use color as needed.

CostumeMaking
As part of preparations for Picnic Day, CSA casually meets once a week during the winter and spring quarters. During these meetings, members sew together ancient Greek or Roman costumes and construct modes of transportation. (More on this under http://daviswiki.org/Classical_Studies_Association#headc5497bca58468ae64aed6c0fd921109217988db3 CSA Events.)
Games
Games can be said to cleanse the soul. Thus, CSA holds an afternoon or night once a quarter for members to relax together over board games, cards, or trivia.
Nota Bene
Nota Bene is the UC Davis undergraduate journal for Classical Studies. Each year, students submit their essays (either from personal writing time or various classes) to be published!
Email CSA to contact Colin if you are interested in submitting an essay for this years journal.
Storytime
Movies
Be they Classicists or not, students unite, not easily forgetting the fiery commentary that takes place during Classicsrelated films! Showings are free, and students examine historical (or mythological) accuracy and film consistency. Past showings include Life of Brian, Troy, and 300.
When relevant films, such as The Immortals, are in theaters, CSA members dine together before journeying to the cinema to observe the film as one classical presence.
Mythology
Whether they have taken CLA 10 (or CLA 3) or not, members of CSA enjoy discussion myths and history. Sometimes heatedly, though its all in good fun.

Events
Most events take place in the spring quarter, though Picnic Day is one of CSAs biggest events of the year and is prepared for through all preceding quarters.
Life of Brian
An old tradition at the first meeting of the fall quarter is to show the Monty Python film Life of Brian. Officers for the year and new members are introduced here!
The first meeting of this fall quarter will take place on Monday, October 8th. We will break tradition by watching History of the World, Part I.
Picnic Day

Members go allout in making their costumes and choreographing their march movements. Just as important is the construction of ancient forms of transportation in the parade; past examples include a sailing ship and chariots!
Students walk alongside Classics professors during the parades march. Past themes have included The Twelve Labors of Heracles and Jason and the Argonauts.
Last years theme involved Caesar leading Cleopatra and his Roman legion to the forum!
