About
Classroom Survivor, the comic that distinguished Users/JohnDudek as a competent comedian and comic artist, was brought onto the scene in the school year of 0203. The original idea behind the story was that eight students from a high school class would be locked in that classroom until only one was left surviving. This story was backed with comical interpretations of various students within the classroom, and their antics. The comic gained a large fan base within the underground comic community at Holmes Junior High School, and now at Davis Senior High

Issues
  The original Classroom Survivor is currently lost.
  The second Classroom Survivor, written in the 0304 school year, is hidden away somewhere in Users/JohnDudeks room, along with a thousand other drawings and comics.
  Last year, Classroom Survivor failed to even start after a failure of ideas.

It is rumoured that Users/JohnDudek is currently working on character sketches for a new 0506 Classroom Survivor, but rumours have not been proven true.

A cover picture will be posted soon for the 0304 Issue


Other Work
