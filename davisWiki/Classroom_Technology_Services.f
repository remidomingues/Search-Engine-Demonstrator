This page is for historical purposes only. CTS no longer exists as an independent entity.


In 2007, Classroom Technology Services merged with Mediaworks to form Academic Technology Services. All of CTSs services are still available, just under different names.

http://cts.ucdavis.edu/ Classroom Technology Services, under the information and educational technology dept, is available for campus departments, clubs, orgs, faculty and staff. They charge through University Recharge and Purchase Order. They also take cash or charge. If you need any kind of equipment, CTS might have it for you to rent.  They specialize in AudioVisual and Printer Repair. They also distribute the keys to the lock boxes in all lecture halls. For instance, if you need a remote to navigate DVD menus, CTS is your man.
