The Classroom Technology Team is part of the Learning Spaces group in Academic Technology Services. Their offices are located in Surge II, however technicians generally spend most of their time out on job sites.

The Classroom Tech Team is responsible for installing and maintaining the audiovisual equipment in UC davis classrooms classrooms and campus lecture halls lecture halls. Many campus departments also hire them via recharge to install audiovisual systems in their departmental rooms. CTT monitors the classroom hotline approximately 8am10pm  most classes fall in this window. However, chances are good somebody will still answer after 10pm.

The day crew works approximately 8am5pm. Mostly, they work on new installations. They also respond to calls from instructors who are having problems with a classroom media cabinet. They assist professors who are unsure of how to use the equipment and also make emergency repairs. However, they often do not have time in between classes to make major repairs  which is where the night crew comes in.

The night crew works approximately 6pm2:30am. They spend most of their time doing maintenance and repairs in classrooms (the middle of the night is the only time the classrooms arent in use). Technicians visit each classroom once or twice a week for a complete inspection and test of the multimedia systems. They also make more involved and time consuming repairs that cant be done during the day. Technically, they are supposed to kick out unauthorized wellman hall Wellman moviegoers or groups without reservations. Especially during the fall, the technicians take a lot of flack from student groups who either dont bother to reserve a room for their meeting or reserve one room and think that it entitles them to take over the whole building. But really, the technicians dont like kicking people out. If you treat them nicely, they will often try to accommodate you. (Case and point: DRAGON only reserves one room in Wellman, but they end up using most of the second floor. But because most DRAGONgoers are reasonably polite, CTT tries to service the second floor by Thursday night each week. It doesnt always happen, but the effort is made.)
