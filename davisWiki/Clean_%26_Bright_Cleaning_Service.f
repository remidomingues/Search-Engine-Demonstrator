Clean & Bright is a Janitorial Services cleaning service.



20130807 11:48:32 nbsp My landlord required our house and carpets to be professionally cleaned at the end of our lease. My roommates and I had Clean & Bright out yesterday to clean our place. They spent much more time than I expected and did a great thorough job! It was nice that they were able to do both house cleaning and carpets in the same day making it much easier on us for scheduling. They also gave us a student discount making the price very comparable to other cleaning services.  The owner Richard was very pleasant to work with and I would recommend them to others!

After having been loyal customers they have even cleaned extra parts of our house for free when needed. The owner is very nice and a pleasure to work with. Hire them and dont look back, you will NOT regret it! Users/AEPi
