Clear is a national wireless internet provider. They internet service providers provide wireless 3G and 4G broadband that covers almost all of the Davis area (check their http://www.clear.com/coverage/ coverage map). You can buy a modem to set up wireless internet for your house or choose from their mobile hotspot selection which will cover your devices (laptop, netbook, telephones phone, videogaming game system, etc) on the go.

Their prices are competitive compared to a company like Verizon or Sprint because they have built their own wireless towers and sell their wireless plans wholesale. They are the providers for Sprints national 4G network so if you are using Sprint you are actually on Clears network.

Locally Cybershield are Clears official wireless plan resellers.

Of course, if youre looking to go clear in a totally different way, our local Scientology Scientologists might be able to help you.


20120124 17:54:10 nbsp I just got a Clear box from bestbuy in woodland for $99 (Clear Spot 4G Apollo). Was able to sign up for the $35 plan on the clear website and got online within 10 minutes of unboxing. Speedtest.net gave me about 1.5MB download, which is what I am allotted for $35. I am located in Mace Ranch, near Lake Alhambra and I am able to connect to the 4G virtually anywhere inside my house. Not the fastest internet, but this is by far the most hassle free internet setup ever. I must say though, I can not watch a 720p youtube video because the connection is too slow. Users/VinhBoy

20120913 15:58:30 nbsp Am beginning to think I may have made a bad move from Comcast to Clear.  The signal strength from the same tower can vary by 50% in a 24 hour period, the speeds slow predictably in the morning and stay slow all evening until late at night.  My location is in the best coverage area.  Hard to watch Netflix, HBO  anything that requires any consistent download speed. Users/DaveyBalaban
