Called Lypoyomi by the Pomo Indians, Clear Lake is the largest natural lake entirely in California and is believed to be the oldest lake in North America. On the south side of the Lake is Mt. Konocti, a 4299 ft volcano which is the second highest peak in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field. Clear Lake is the primary attraction in Lake County, offering some of the states best bass fishing and excellent water skiing conditions from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Lake County provides the wine enthusiast with excellent opportunities for tasting and touring. Some of Clear Lakes numerous wine attractions include Jim Fetzers Ceago Vinegarden, a certified organic biodynamic facility situated on prime lake front property (between Lucerne and Nice on Highway 20), Steele Wines (outside Kelseyville at Highway 29 and Thomas Road), and Wildhurst Vineyards (in downtown Kelseyville). Most wineries offer tastings for $5, wine club memberships, and harvest festivals in the mid fall. Clear Lake State Park features excellent lakeside camping facilities and is conveniently located 3.5 miles from Kelseyville. On the south shore of the lake, Konocti Harbor Resort hosts concerts (typically classic rock or country) in its large outdoor amphitheater.

There are at least three routes to follow to get there. One is to drive north up Interstate 5 to Williams and then get on California 20 headed west. You can also take California 16 from Woodland. The most scenic, but seasonably impassable route is the Berryessa Knoxville Road.
