Clearwater Apartmentsformerly Tennis Club Apartments, until a 2010 renameis an apartment complex located in South Davis at 4141 Cowell Blvd. The complex is known for being home to mostly to middle class families, young professionals, and only a few UC Davis students and staff.

The complex includes a 75 foot swimming pool and two laundry facilities. New frontload Maytag no coin washers and dryers were recently put in. It also has easy access to Unitrans P and Q lines and is pretty close to the A line.  MoveIn Bonus of High Speed Internet for new tenants signing a 12 month lease. According to the complex website, This offer is for new tenants with a twelve month rental agreement and may be discontinued at any time at our sole option.

The complex has also just put in (Summer 2010) new doublepane windows and sliding doors. These make heating and cooling of apartments much more efficient and thus much cheaper. All of the apartments have pretty large patios. Especially the downstairs apartments which have huge patios.

Pets are not allowed.

Per the complexes website, pricing as of January 2014 is:

plus a $500 security deposit.


The complex gained the towns spotlight on November 18, 2004 when one of its residents, tragic events Dennis Thrower, was shot to death in an exchange of gunfire with one or two individuals at around 5:50 am. The incident was Davis first homicide since 1998, leaving many residents of the complex and South Davis baffled as to how the murder could have happened in a relatively uneventful and quiet part of town, where crime rarely rises above bicycle thefts and several car burglaries.

20070830 15:33:05 nbsp Ive lived here for 6 years. It started out great with a wonderful manager who went out of his way to make sure you were comfortable and who didnt care about hours but would treat you like a friend. The next manager was nice as well. But the current management is HORRIBLE. also, the owner only thinks about money and not at all about the people living there. I am moving out after 6 years of NO late payments and the manager wont walk through the apartment with me ONE HOUR later because she doesnt get paid overtime. Even though she lives about 2 seconds away 4 doors down and it is too inconvenient.

no body gives a crap about your needs. They just want to make more money. you are not allowed to bbq anymore either, because the owner doesnt want to pay the insurance increase to allow it. the office hours are during normal work hours so you can never talk to the manager and you get charged extra for needing assistance outside of the regular work schedule.

this place has turned in a stressful place to live where all the residents are being taken advantage of. I am not the only one moving out because of it. I would have recommended this place a few years ago...but now it is a real hellhole. Users/dbee

20070905 18:05:38 nbsp I lived here between Feb 2006 and Aug 2007. They had three different managers during this time and they got rid of the onsite handyman. Luckily nothing in my place needed fixing. When I moved out, I was charged $50 for light cleaning, $50 for painting and $81 for carpet steam cleaning. Apparently the light cleaning is for dusting the blinds because the manager told me I did a great cleaning job during our walk through. Theyll always charge you painting unless youve lived there for more than 3 years.

But the most annoying thing is that they wont refund my laundry card deposit. They have card operated washer and dryers on site. You have to pay $5 deposit when you first buy a card from the machine. Ive always been told that after I moved out and returned the card to the manager, Ill get my card deposit back. I was told this even during the walk through. But when I got the deposit refund check and found it was $10 short(I returned two cards), I called and they told me they dont refund laundry card deposits! When did that change of policy happen? And why did they still take my cards if they werent going to refund me? Are they just trying to scam every possible dolloar out of their tenants? $10 isnt a big deal but this is really annoying. Im still haggling with them and Ill post updates if therere any new developments.

So bottomline is I dont recommend this place. The rent has increased way too much in the past year and its really overpriced given the quality you get. Users/ChWong

20070918 22:27:39 nbsp This is an update to my laundry card deposit argument with them. At first they just gave me an email address of their parent company. This is only an email address for suggestions and of course I got no response from them. So I filed a complaint with Better Business Bureau and heres their reply:

We regret any confusion. Our written Rental Agreement is what we, and our residents, rely on. It is the complete agreement and clearly states there are no other verbal agreements.
We do not do refunds for laundry cards. The machine dispensing them asked the resident when he purchased them: Would you like to buy a card?. The price is clearly shown as $5 onscreen. The customer then must choose YES or NO. Mr. XXX apparently chose YES to buy two cards.
Nonetheless we would be happy to give Mr. XXX $10 if he will stop by during office hours. This does not however change our policy.

But they failed to explain why all three managers told me I would get my card deposit back at various times during my stay, even on the day of walkthrough. And how come I only heard about their norefund policy when I called them and ask them why my refund check was $10 short? Nonetheless, Im glad I finally got my money back. Ill leave you to form your own opinion on all these. Users/ChWong
       For what its worth, some friends of ours moved into a complex that uses laundry cards, and when they received their card it already had $3.50 on and they were thrilled. So youre probably making someones day.  Users/ElleWeber

20080623 21:16:03 nbsp I have lived at this complex for almost a year now and have had a very pleasant experience here so far (knock on wood). The manager, Liya, is lovely and probably is the best apartment manager Ive ever had. My main complaint is that we cant have pets (not even a bird or a reptile) and many of the other tenants have cats up the wazoo because they were grandfathered in  I guess the no pets policy is new (though it is obvious that numerous people have smuggled kittens into their apartments anyways). It would be nice if we had the option of paying a deposit in order to keep a pet here.  Users/soledad101

20090618 22:03:35 nbsp I have lived here for more than four years and enjoyed the great swimming pool, quiet and safe environment, efficient management. Whenever I have a problem the management will come immediately because the manager really cares about her tenants. The lawn, flower beds and night bulbs are all well maintained and no loud noise have ever been heard because the rules are well respected and obeyed thanks to the wonderful management. Users/Jeffery

20100809 15:53:09 nbsp Im http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CADavisTennisClubApartments1102806.html confused... Are these called Tennis Club Apartments or Clearwater Apartments?  Could a tenant or manager please update the wiki page, as well as the prices and policies if they have changed?  Thank you! Users/LauraLibby

20100815 15:55:46 nbsp To answer the previous question. Yes this is now Clearwater Apartments. Users/DHuey

20110911 19:05:36 nbsp I have never written a review before but felt compelled to warn people about this complex.  I have lived at Clearwater (formerly the Tennis Club Apartments) for two years.  Having a semi pleasant experience the first year, I decided to stay for a second year.  DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.  Dont get me wrongthe residents here are typically quiet, and the pool area is nice. However, the pool is never heated so you can really only use it during the warmer months. Additionally, the pool is frequently dirty.

The reason why I would NOT recommend renting from Clearwater is the management.  The manager, Liya, is frequently out of her office and it becomes a sort of game to try to catch her. She rarely answers the phone or responds to emails and when she does, she is unclear.  Furthermore, she is extremely unhelpful and not pleasant to deal with.  Being a graduate student, I was lucky enough to have time during the day to track her down, but I can imagine how impossible this would be if I had a full time job.  Additionally, Liya is not apologetic when something goes wrong with the apartment and takes her sweet time in the repair.  Finally, YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR FULL DEPOSIT MONEY BACK.  My apartment was completely clean, no stains on the carpet, nothing broken, yet she requires that her cleaning people come. Additionally, she will require you to pay for a new paint job, even if nothing is wrong with the wall. Thus, even though there was no damage (it was just normal wear and tear), I only received 280 out of my original 500.

In sum, this is a great place to live until anything goes wrong with your apartment. Once something needs repair, the subpar quality of management negates any positive qualities this complex has to offer.  Users/LawStuff

20120330 12:54:16 nbsp Ive lived here for two years.  This is a great place to live.  Its quiet and clean.  There are rarely any parties; when there are, you can barely hear them, if at all (I could almost hear my sharedwall neighbors party if I had all my appliances turned off, everything was still, and I was straining to listen).  The neighbors all look out for one another and keep the place looking clean and nice.  Liya is one of the best apartment managers Ive ever seen (Ive lived in 4 different complexes over the past 6 years).  She answers all questions honestly and to the best of her ability, and she does what she can to help out the tenants.  She keeps an eye out for anyone suspicious in the area, and directly questions anyone hanging around that is not with a tenant.  Friends of mine have positively commented about this because she helped them find my apartment.  My phone calls and emails to Liya have always been returned in a reasonable amount of time (usually same day, but sometimes the next day). Repairs have been performed in a reasonable amount of time, and emergencies have been responded to immediately.  Be aware that the maintenance guy does not live on the property and this is not the only property he maintains, so it may take a few days for nonemergency repairs. The longest Ive had to wait was three days.

The only reason Im leaving is to reduce my commute time to work.

To the person complaining about the deposit: Ive never heard of an apartment that gives the full deposit back in any of the places Ive lived, any of the places my spouse has lived, any of the places any of my past roommates have lived, or any of the places any of my friends have lived.  Its ridiculous to expect your full deposit back, no matter where you live. Users/JarredCaldwell


201204013 1:41AM  I am currently nearing the end of my 1year lease here, and I have had a very positive experience.  The manager is very friendly and helpful.  It brightens my day to go chat with her when I have a question to ask.  The apartments have a very peaceful and homelike atmosphere.  I have also been especially impressed by how clean the laundry room is!  This has not been the case at other apartments where I have lived with shared laundry rooms.  I recommend this apartment.

I disagree with LawStuffs comments about the manager being difficult to get a hold of.  This has not been my experience.  I walk past the main office every day, and the manager is always in there during the posted hours, which I believe would work with most peoples schedule.  There are even Saturday hours for if you work during the week.  I have never had a problem finding an office hour to fit into my schedule.  Perhaps this has improved since that post.

20120711 21:08:13 nbsp I lived here for a year and unfortunately I did not have a very good experience with Liya, the manager.  She is generally friendly but if something breaks and she doesn’t consider it a priority, you may have to wait a long time until she does anything to get it fixed, or it may not get fixed at all.  On the plus side, the complex is pretty quiet and in walking distance to the Nugget. Users/AggieAlumni09

20120729 11:53:17 nbsp Im a law student and lived here for one year (leaving due to transferring for unrelated reasons). When I was originally apartment hunting in Davis I had three main criteria: Safe & quiet, nearby amenities (e.g. grocery store, cleaners, restaurants, etc.), and away from the hussle of downtown but close enough so that getting there would be a hop and a skip. Clearwater apartments met this criteria perfectly.

It seems mostly populated by professionals and graduate students so it has a very quiet and respectful atmosphere, and the manager Liya Ju takes her job seriously so if you were to have a disrespectful neighbor or something of the sort she would do her best to take care of it. The apartments are situated wonderfully in terms of amenities; theres a nugget (a nice grocery store famous in the area) and a couple of good restaurants in walking distance, a safeway and more restaurants nearby, a Target a couple of minutes away, a couple of gas stations, and I even felt fortunate to have Toyota dealership in walking distance when my car was having some trouble. The apartments are also separate from downtown, adding to the peace and quiet. It takes almost no time, however, to get downtown or to the UC Davis campus (I personally drive but I know many people who bike).

I think if youre a graduate student, a professional, or just a more lowkey undergraduate student you would be very happy living here. In addition to just being solid apartments and having the qualities I mention above, the staff is wonderful. Liya Ju is the manager and she goes out of her way to make sure everyone is comfortable. The poster below me notes that the office hours are during regular work hours, which is true, but the office is also open on Saturdays and Liya has always accommodated me if I had any special needs. For example, if you have a package (which shell receive in her office for you) shell set it out by your door before she closes if you need her to. Also, she has always been readily available through email and other means, and I cant think of a time that I had something I thought couldnt be handled by email, faxing, etc. or wait until the weekend. Ive had some bad experiences with apartment management at other places Ive lived, so I consider the management at clearwater to be a real plus.

Happy apartment hunting, and be sure to check out clearwater! Users/Ted2012

20120730 17:04:45 nbsp I lived here from 2010 to 2012. These apartments aren’t bad for the price but the manager, Liya, was difficult to get a hold of the few times I needed her help and she was not very friendly when she finally called me back. I found the residents to be friendly and generally quiet, so if that’s more important to you than good management, you might still consider this place. Users/HistoryBuff

20130624 10:05:50 nbsp Lived here for 3 years and it has been a pleasant experience.  Liya, the manager, has been wonderful for several reasons: she cares about the property and the tenants, she is VERY attentive and fast to accomodate any fixes or needs you may have, and shes respectful.   Clearwater accommodates mostly professional and older people, but Ive noticed an infiltration of undergrads recently. For the most part, this complex is quiet (aside from daily dumpster divers and the occasional loud party).  I realize others have had a different experience, but heres the secret: DONT be an idiot AND BE respectful/mindful of others. Users/buddha563

 I will definitely not recommend this place. This place is way too quiet and creepy at night. There was a homicide case right across the street last year and FBI came at your door and ask if you have seen any suspicious person. This makes you feel really unsafe at night. Besides, the manager  Liya Ju was way to bossy and mean to her tenants. She immediately catches you and warned you in a very mean way when she saw you doing something not right for the first time, it makes people want to stay away from her. She is not helpful and acts like she is the boss or somewhat that she has the right to treat her tenants badly if they do not OBEY her rules. I have stayed here for years but I moved away mainly because the manager Liya, even though it might not be the smartest choice. But it seems to be the best choice to move out when you dont have to live with a person who treats you in a bad way.
