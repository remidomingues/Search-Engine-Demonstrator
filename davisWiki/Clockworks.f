The retail location closed in December of 2007. Darrell, owner, is available by appointment for clock repair. You may contact him at 5307564325 or at clockworks@cal.net.

Clockworks is the preeminent clock store in Davis. They sell contemporary (not antique) tall case (grandfather) clocks, wall clocks, desk clocks, and more. They also do clock repair. They are a traditional clock store, meaning you wont find highart clocks (go to The Artery or Sacramento or San Francisco for those), or atomic clocks (I keep hoping). They also sell a few greeting cards, candles, and sports trophies. Go to just marvel at all the clocks, all showing different times...

When you get a clock that requires a battery, the repaired clock will come with a new battery!

They used to have a post office in the rear, but it is gone. If you need to mail something, theres a place out Umall parking lot.

If you need to replace a battery in your watch, Clockworks will do it for about $8, while you wait. Is there any place else in town that does this?
