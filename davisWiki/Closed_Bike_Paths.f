Paths with Poor Conditions

  arboretum Arboretum  The path around most of the arboretum is currently in very bad condition for road biking.  The path is broken up by tree roots along much of the path.
  The path that leads from the intersection of La Rue Road and Hutchison Drive terminates abruptly at the The Worst Intersection on Campus and is no longer useful, forcing cyclists to ride in narrow bike lanes along a street with heavy traffic.
  The south side of Covell Boulevard from Monarch Lane to Alhambra Drive has huge tracts of rooted land.
