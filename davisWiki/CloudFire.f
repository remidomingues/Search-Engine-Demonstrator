20081020 22:18:24 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. Fire and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the recent reviews.  Keep in mind that this is your wiki too, so if you think an entry is too slanted in a particular direction, hit the Edit button and rewrite the entry.  A good technique is to respect the opinion of the other editor (who you disagree with) and create a new entry that shows both your opinions.  For instance, on the Pizza Hut Express entry, you could go hit edit, and rewrite it so it reflects both your opinion (that its tasty) and that others feel that its too greasy, but that its better than the pizzas at the Silo (thus adding Patricks opinion).  You arent limited to just adding comments  it is your wiki too, and you have a full say in what is in the entries themselves (just like everybody else).  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
