The Cloud Forest Cafe is a locally owned Cafes cafe that opened for business August 11, 2008.  They serve fresh, inhouse roasted coffee, have a juice and espresso bar, and have panini and pastries from Village Bakery.  They offer two standard vegetarian sandwiches: the Valley Veggie and the Fresh Mozz.

In the summer of 2011, they started serving latenight street tacos on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. You can get a carne asada or pollo asado taco on the patio outside the restaurant for $1.25, or five for $5. Its a great pre or postbar snack!

Cloud Forest is a Study Spots studyfriendly cafe, and there are electrical outlets available. Free wifi is offered under the network name Dlink. They as well give 10 cents off your purchase when you bring in your own cup.

Cloud Forest Cafe was previously located on Lake Boulevard in Stonegate Video. The business has a new location in downtown Davis. Stonegate Coffee and Cloud Forest Cafe are two separate businesses owned by two different owners.

The location was previously Aesops Room, a toy store, and previously previously The End Zone

Cloud Forest Cafe has a $5 card minimum or 35 cents will be added to the cost of your purchases.

They carry Daviss own BRÜBAR Energy Bars.

20080726 08:00:36 nbsp Went by and talked to the owner 2 days ago.  He hopes to be open in the next week or 2. They did a nice job with the inside. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080811 22:05:15 nbsp I had the organic coffee today, which is from Nicaragua. Was great!!! Outdoor seating looks wonderful...will try that in a day or two.  Users/KarenKane

20080812 12:45:35 nbsp We went there for lunch yesterday, their first day in business.  The location is great, nice patio, let us sit out there with our dog, all plusses.  There was excitement & eagerness among the staff.  However, many problems. The pastry case was nearly empty. The only thing on the manu to set it apart was a list of fresh juices  none of which were available because the juicer had not arrived yet.  Ditto on smoothies (not a unique item, but also not yet available).  They had only one vegetarian option so I had to order it; a serviceable sandwich but not super special.  The staff slowly created it using typed out instructions.  They needed to put more fresh avocado in it  that was the only interesting ingredient & it was merely smeared lightly, no slices.  The breads are ciabatto (sp?) or focaccia  good, but where is a healthier whole grain option?  I plan to go back when the juices are available to try those out, however unless they offer more vegetarian options that will end up being the last time. Users/Dora5

20080814 19:16:26 nbsp I was about to make the same comments as the person above me as I went by today to see what it was like.  Seems like they opened up before they were ready, but still, its a nice place to sit and read a book with a cup of coffee (which is what Ive been looking for cause Im long since tired of the crowds that Starbucks tends to get).  The prices are really decent though, so I will definitely be back when they are geared to go. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080815 17:01:27 nbsp Did this used to occupy the Westlake Plaza? Google results seem to place it there, for some reason... Users/JoePomidor
 Yes, it did. Maybe it even still does, I think the owners also own the video store. Maybe I even owe them money. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080818 19:00:29 nbsp Good food and good service, but the bathroom does not come close to being wheelchair accessible which is important to me as my job is to assist someone who is for the most part wheelchair bound. Users/HazelWatson

20080824 09:37:31 nbsp This place is a boon for coffee lovers. The owner roasts coffee at the store in small batches. Back when they were way in west davis, every once in a while I used to bike all the way from east davis to get coffee beans for espresso. After it closed, I periodically got beans from Old Soul Co. in Sactown, which is quite a haul. I was very happy to see when he reopened in a great location in downtown! This weekend I went to the new store and he immediately recognized me and offered to roast a custom batch. He made me a double espresso (on the house!) so I could get a taste and see if I wanted any changes on the blend. I gave a thumbs up and within a few hours, he had a pound of beans for me (for only $9.99!). I made a cup this morning and it was fabulous. Because espresso beans tend to taste best a few days after roasting, I anticipate that they are likely to get even better over the next few days!

I suspect that the inhouse coffee and food service will be a work in progress for a short while, given that the employees are new and will benefit from more experience. Nonetheless, this place is well worth supporting. A great alternative to the other cafes in town in which the service, coffee, and ambiance are mediocre and/or inconsistent. Users/CharanRanganath

20080825 14:23:37 nbsp I stopped in a couple days after they opened and got a cup of coffee to go.  It was very good and the space felt comfortable.  Every time Ive been back by there, they have been closed.  Hopefully, once they get their juicer and the staff is up and running, they will keep regular hours.  Downtown could definitely use another place where folks can enjoy a decent cup of coffee in a pleasant setting to take some of the pressure off of Mishkas.  The Roma replacements have been terribly disappointing with their loud music (Peets) and oppresive TVs (3rd & U). Users/aharjala

20080829 13:53:32 nbsp Im here now.  I had been eager to try it out ever since I first heard about this place a few weeks back.  The coffee is wonderful.  It is so good and I dont normally like coffee.  Leaps and bounds better than Starbucks.
The place looks nice, clean and inviting.  They have free wifi (as noted above) and it offers a studyfriendly atmosphere.  And its not too noisy or pretentious (like Mishkas).  But its also good for the chatters, too.  Best of both worlds.  The Staff is very nice and helpful, too.  I highly recommend this place.  I give it a Numba one. . .   Users/CurlyGirl26

Initial Review

 + Beans are roasted in house.
 + All their food is freshly made to order, to rave compliments of customers. So far, 3 customers have come up to the register to give compliments since Ive been here. They definitely appear to be a food oriented cafe.
 + Espresso is surprisingly better than any other in Davis, probably because the beans are freshly roasted and a barista who cares a little.
 + Free wireless internet
 + Family owned/operated
 + Pleasant interior

  The espresso still isnt good. Its not terrible, its drinkable, but its not good.
  They only have paper cups, which severely degrades the coffee experience.
  Suffers from stifffoammilk syndrome, I will tip $10 to the first barista in Davis who knows how to steam milk properly.
  Music is supplied by a radio station, obnoxious commercials and all.
  Only 2 outlets available for laptops
  Bench in the back is very tall, I am about 510  511 and my feet cant rest flat on the floor.
  Their beans come in Dark and Columbian roasts. Dark is not a roast, its a vague description of the roast color. Columbian refers to the country of origin, not a roast profile. They should mark the bags with Country of origin (preferably the crop name as well), and the roast profile (lightcity, city, full city, Vienna, French, etc). Take advantage of the fact that their beans are fresh roasted, as opposed to Peets and Starbucks. EDIT: Ive noticed now that they stamp the country of origin at the bottom, although the bottom is often obscured in their basket.

Overall, a very up and coming cafe. Even though they have some rough edges, they have a lot of promise to become my preferred cafe in Davis. If they step up their game in the coffee the way they did with the food, and maybe address some of the negatives I laid out here, they will be a big success. They will most likely be a success even if they dont improve their coffee, since their coffee is still a little better than all other cafes in Davis, but one can hope. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

  There was once a girl that worked at Seattles Best in Borders that knew how to steam milk properly.  She also made the best latte in the world (which Ive since not had better even outside Davis), but sadly she no longer works there and has since moved away (though we keep in touch, Id feel awkward asking her to steam milk for me...lol). Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  it looks like now they may be marking roasts properly. i was at  Ikedas Ikedas and saw their coffee, though they only had full city and dark which i didnt bother with but i assume is a french roast. it smelled decent but id have to taste to judge, and indeed their bags are marked with country of origin now (tanzania, sumatra, costa rica, etc.)


20081005 14:30:41 nbsp This is my new favorite coffee shop.  Its a pleasant place to hang out, study, read the paper, etc.  The Staff is friendly and most accommodating.  Tables and chairs are perfect for studying.  Ive been parked here all day, have a good work space and no one has given me the the Stink Eye yet.  Free internet and good coffee.  Its not that crap that burns your stomachyet its still strong enough.  I tried a sandwich here today.  It is fresh and tasty.  And very satisfying.  Highly recommend this place.  Im officially a regular now. Users/CurlyGirl26

20081006 13:03:01 nbsp I picked up a sandwich the other day and it was very good.  As are the inhouse roasted coffee beans they sell at the counter. Users/aharjala

20081007 19:13:04 nbsp I wish this place served food later in the day.  I tend to have time to stop by here around 5pm, but they dont serve sandwiches at that time.  Those yummy, yummy sandwiches... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  Edit: Nevermind.  They have changed it so they stop serving sandwiches at 6pm.  Yay me!

20081007 19:18:40 nbsp The Staff says that soon they will be extending their hours to 9pm or so. Users/CurlyGirl26

20081023 22:54:01 nbsp I had the cloud forest panini and it was frickin awesome. I would say it was a study in flavor and contrast, I also perceived a good value! I will most assuredly be back! Users/StevenDaubert

20081029 15:12:01 nbsp This is my first time here. I like the place because the interior is pleasant, the cafe is relatively quiet yet still has some background noise.  The staff is very very nice and helped us fix the wireless connection.  I ordered the Cloud Forest salad and the freshsqueezed juice, and I loved both of these orders. Users/JessicaYang

20081125 09:11:41 nbsp Finally tried them this week. The latte was very good, and the staff was helpful and pleasant. I probably wont go back because I find their chairs uncomfortable and the bench is a couple of inches too high, especially for someone who is 54 (read: kind of short legs). This may not be a problem for others. Users/robinlaughlin

        I think some very comfortable indoor armchairs  think the Borders set up  would be a great addition for Cloud Forrest. I, too, was uncomfortable in their chairs, but very happy with the coffee. Users/RichRifkin

        Hmm, Im 53 and never had a problem with the chairs.  But, I could just be used to tall chairs.  I agree that a comfy reading spot would be nice. Users/DanaSullivan
        They are talking about the bench in the back being too tall. Users/KellyM

20081204 11:13:54 nbsp My very favorite cafe!  The cranberry bleu salad is especially delicious.  The lattes are also great, nice and strong. Users/DanaSullivan

20081205 23:07:36 nbsp Nice and yummy sandwiches that are just portioned right and on the cheaper side. They need to get proper mugs and glasses though...as of current, they only offer disposable cups, which is just wasteful (and reason enough for me to not visit there unless I have to). Users/il

20081206 15:04:20 nbsp Its a nice cheery open place.  One of the key things forgotten by many people is how the place makes you feel when you step in.  Cloud Forest is clean and airy, with large windows that let in plenty of sunlight.  It has a good feel to it.  They were also cheerful and suggested various items as I stared at the menu.  The people working there also employ common sense rather than corporate mentality, letting me take photos without batting an eye. Users/JabberWokky

20090127 23:52:28 nbsp I stumbled upon this place last week and was surprised I never really noticed it before. The interior is really interesting and artsy, but the seating was a little hard. The bench I sat on felt like it was made for a much bigger person, but personally I like the feeling when my feet swings above the floor. The panini was delicious! I think I had the cache creek caliente and my friend had the cloud forest. I enjoyed both. It was a very reasonable price and I especially liked the side of apples/potato salad addition. I also had a smoothie(decent) which the girl upgrade to a large for free bc they were out peaches and had to turn it into a strawberrybanana. Im definitely coming back to try the other panini and salads.   Users/skinnyfatgirl

20090129 14:58:50 nbsp I really like this place, but Id definitely come here more often if they had more comfortable chairs.   Users/MonicaWilliams
20090130 14:14:07 nbsp Had another cloud forest, it was excellent Users/StevenDaubert

 As did I, around 3pm.  Great stuff. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090217 17:31:37 nbsp I really like it here! The food is not expensive, good quality, nice atmosphere and I enjoy the posted art work. The only problem is that the wireless internet is flaky, the staff told me they are in the process of revamping their wireless. There are more outlets now, too. Users/SamanthaP

20090228 15:17:47 nbsp It seems like they are slowly replacing the uncomfortable chairs with more comfortable ones and have dramatically improved the food. This place really listens to feedback and is quickly becoming the best place to study in Davis (in my opinion). The could use a rug or two ... to dampen the noise. The owner and all the staff are really nice & very attentive. Users/jsg718

20090309 12:28:47 nbsp This place has fast grown on me. Staff is great, coffee is great, light is great. Theyve fixed the internet, and I think theyre working on the chairs (hooray!). I agree with above  a couple of rugs would be good to dampen noise and increase the cozy factor. Also, I like the music but I think they play the same satellite station all the time, and the station repeats quite a few tunes. Mixing it up a little would be a bonus. There must be more than one tropical station!

Also, sandwiches are very tasty, as are the housemade cream cheese and bagels (though one I got the other day was a bit stale, all others have been excellent).

  Edit: Sandwiches remain delicious, but no more housemade cream cheese flavours! Bummer. Music mix remains a problem, more the fault of satellite radio than Cloud Forest, but still  changing the station more regularly would mean less chance of hearing the same songs over and over again. Before it was the same bachata songs, now its the same acoustic songs. I like it all, just not the repetitiveness! Still my favorite coffee and study spot in Davis, by a longshot. Users/Kay

20090309 23:10:09 nbsp This is now officially my favorite coffee shop in Davis.  Good coffee, good food, and great atmosphereespecially for we studiers. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090317 08:08:52 nbsp nice place, very welcoming. the windows make it spacious I think. good place to study. :) Users/lilmonstu

20090325 22:21:31 nbsp This cute little café is a welcome addition to Daviss sandwiches sandwich scene.  The grilled paninis all have nice fresh vegetables included, with a choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread.  I quite like the ciabatta, which seemed very fresh; havent tried the focaccia.  The smoothies were also quite good.  I get the feeling that this place is emphasizing quality over quantity; there arent a lot of choices, but all the choices are good.  Smart move.  One weird little annoyance  passing through the doors (even the door to the restroom) sets short beeping alarm. Users/CovertProfessor

20090328 13:35:37 nbsp

+ I love the hazelnut lattes & Cloud Forest paninis.
+ I like the wall of windows, but the sun shines into the cafe a bit too brightly in the afternoon.
+ Staff is very friendly.
 Internet connections have been getting flaky again, though they were good for a while.

They seem to have switched to using Sirius radio, which does a good job of shuffling up the playlist.

All in all, I think that the place is great. Users/DanAlcantara

20090501 11:11:01 nbsp The smoothies are a delight. Had a live band playing last week in the afternoon. Fuzzy something?  Users/13urningMonk

20090516 10:34:29 nbsp
I appreciate:
 that they offer fairtrade coffee,
 that the salad is delicious,
 my roommates love the smoothies,
 I look forward to the cafetos when they turn up in the summer,
 excellent location,
 reasonable hours,
 $0.50 refills,
 friendly atmosphere,
 beautiful artwork,
 excellent seating,
 (nifty chairs),
 good place to study or be social!

Things Id like to see:
 sufficient bicycle parking
 an incentive for using your own thermos or “for here” cups
 reusable forks
 Is the organic coffee the only organic one?  If not (as the baristas say), label the others that are.
 Prominently label the coffee as fair trade (it is, right?)
 use fairtrade bananas to match the fairtrade coffee
 a community bulletin board
 better breakfast food selection? or maybe start lunch a little earlier?
 maybe feature some local/organic food items?  (i.e., a local salad and a local/seasonal fruit smoothie. ) Users/Angel.York

20090520 21:55:38 nbsp I agree with all of the suggestions just above this (and also still stand by my earlier posts stating my love for Cloud Forest!). In general, reusable drinking cups, sidedish cups (for the apple/potato salad), and silverware would be excellent. The mug supply is limited and I hate to waste a plastic cup just for some water that Im drinking in house  plus Id guess that in the long run it could save CF some money. Users/Kay
  Hooray  CF has taken one step in the right direction and gotten more mugs.
  Another hooray  now theyve replaced the disposable plastic sidedish cups with reusable ones. Also, current special (El Cubano) is very tasty. Users/Kay

20090609 18:34:17 nbsp Went there for the first time after reading comments. Nice place, good coffee, but there were just a few things that turned me off. A little uncomfortable for long term sitting, and couldnt sit on the bench which is high (Im 52). And after I asked for light ice,  the guy filled my cup with sink water to make it full which really watered down the coffee. Ill go there again, and try their food which looked good, but I am really picky about my coffee. Hopefully the next visit will change my impression.  Users/DaniD

20090611 18:16:21 nbsp I love this place more and more. I really appreciate how they listen to suggestions and act on them. Theyve added more power strips. The addition of the reusable cups for the apples/potato salad w/sandwiches was great! The plastic cups they use are the kind recyclable in Davis (#1 and #2). They should make more explicit that those should go in the recycling. Ill keep coming back to Cloud Forest.  Users/jsg718

20090616 13:43:08 nbsp Best coffee and cafe in town.  Great sandwiches also.  Very kidfriendly.  The owner is committed to offering the freshest coffee around.  My family and I always have a great experience here. Users/2umma

20090618 21:54:33 nbsp I really love this place. Its less crowded than the other coffee shops in town and has as good, or even greater coffee. I also love their fresh Mozz sandwhich, with fresh basil, mozzarella and tomato. They have a great location and great coffee to boot.

Cloud Forest has a super friendly staff and everytime Ive been here Ive always left happy. Ive also found it a great place to study, or a nice place to grab a mocha or cup of coffee to go.  Users/HeatherKlinger

20091207 16:33:37 nbsp After waiting for more than a year I finally got around to trying the Cloud Forest Cafe  what a thorough pleasure.  They have a very short food menu, but the panini and salad that I had were so good that Cloud Forest is now on the very short list of places that I recommend to friends from out of own.  The experience was enhanced by the very personable staff and the absence of painfully loud music.  I look forward to returning to try out various items from their longer drinks menu.   Users/oldfant

20100107 20:37:26 nbsp Staff is very nice.  I bring my son in for sandwiches a couple times a week.  They are always friendly and remember his order.  By the way, the sandwiches are great! Users/stodd84

20100125 20:36:37 nbsp This is my favorite Coffee Shop in town. Started regularly going to it Fall Quarter 2009. The staff is friendly, the shop has a good atmosphere, the service is always up to par, and the sandwiches are great.

I get a hot pot of tea all the time, and the only time i remember being dissatisfied was when i received a dirty cup. this of course only happened once and the employee sincerely apologized. (Im forgiving though, people are only human)

My biggest concern, however, is that I noticed that they recently implemented a rule that some tables where designated for dining only, making it so student who wanted to study had to sit at some other table. the employees at the moment dont seem to strict about it though.

As long as Cloud Forest continues to provide great service, I will continue to spend many hours of my life here ) Users/JBernard

20100306 14:30:23 nbsp Reasons Cloud Forest is superior to Mischkas:
 They take cards, always have, and dont have a minimum on card purchases
 Real, fresh, delicious food. Mischkas now has some dirty little wraps or microwave burritos or something but its not fresh sandwich with a side of potato salad, let me tell you.
 there is almost ALWAYS somewhere to sit here.  Mischkas is perpetually overcrowded and too loud to think or talk.
 Not crowded outside with filthy unshowered smokers
 family owned an operated.  Mischkas is too, you say? Cloud Forest is owned by brown people, and their own kids work here. pwnd.
 Cloud Forest staff remember your name if you are a regular.
 FRESH fruit juices. Hello!? I get orange/beet/carrot.  I feel so good after drinking this.
 Outside area has less traffic, more trees.

I like the atmosphere at MIschkas, and it is a great place, dont get me wrong.  But after living in Davis for three years Ive realized Mischkas is more of a place for college poseurs to try to see and be seen, Cloud Forest is better for all the above reasons and its a MUCH better place to do work, especially since you will generally be able to just walk in and sit down.  (as opposed to walking into a throng of chattering assholes and barely being able to breath if you do get a table bc there are so many others taking up the oxygen.) Users/soledad101
  Brown people.... the best color of all?  Why does this make Cloud Forest better than Mishkas?  Users/KenjiYamada
    Er...maybe he thinks so because coffee beans are brown? shrug Im guessing he never drinks white mochas...  Users/SunjeetBaadkar
       First off, Im a woman. Second: as a Latina, my point about Cloud Forest being owned by brown people was not to say that it is somehow more family owned, or better at making coffee, but to point out that I like the idea of supporting minority owned businesses. In case you havent noticed, Davis, like many towns, has a preponderance of whitefamilyowned small biz, and it makes me happy to see Nicaraguans here doing well for themselves and having such a great spot.  For those who find my comments awkward  sorries! not sure why, but thats how I talk kk? Users/soledad101

20100314 12:03:46 nbsp I like Cloud Forest too, Soledad101, and I think its drip coffee is far superior to the coffee at Mishkas (Mishkas does do well with espresso drinks) but I have to say:  your post is a little ridiculous.  You are literally saying that because brown people own Cloud Forest, that makes it more family owned.  And I could be wrong, but Im almost certain only ONE of the owners kids works there...just because other people are brown doesnt mean they are his kids...(The owner is Nicaraguan).  I guess Ill just stop there. Users/KernHaug

20100317 03:36:35 nbsp I actually really enjoy this spot, everytime Ive stopped by. Nothings perfect anywhere, but this coffe spot is keeping it cool. For you two referring to folks as brown, I just want to make sure that we are all aware that not everyone identifies as brown and that it would probably be easier to talk to the owners and find our who they are and where theyre from before makins such awkward comments. Im pretty sure you didnt mean it offensively, but you should be concerned with intent v. impact. As a native person, and as someone who has been identified as brown, it can be a precarios position to locate yourselves. But yes, owners are Nicaraguan. Very cool. Only 1 kid working, that I am aware of, and she is very cool. So Ill see you in the shop right? Coffee for everyone...blessings. Users/Johnathen

20100411 11:58:18 nbsp A few things I would really appreciate seeing at Cloud Forest:

1  Glass cups  juices/smoothies for here
2  Biodegradable cups  juices/smoothies  to go
3  Biodegradable side dish cups  potato salad etc
4  Metal utensils

More and more Davis business are responding to this consumer pressure.
The Farmers Market, for example, has all biodegradable cups now.
The Davis Food Coop has utensils made of potato starch. (I ate one once, just to see)

My last comment:

It appears that CF has been at least somewhat responsive to other similar requests (more mugs instead of paper, etc).
This is really great!, but why not be more public about it?
Post a bulletin board with all the ways you are responding to your community.
Many people in Davis care about this stuff  use it as advertising!

20100814 13:52:38 nbsp I love this place and go to have a coffee and work in the mornings. I also buy my beans here since they roast inhouse. The owner is a really nice guy and has done a great job with the place. I love the rotating artwork! Users/Ratatat

20110423 11:08:52 nbsp This is a great little coffee place, which is not too packed with students. Good coffee, good prices, good setup, and always at least one place to situnlike Peets or Mishkas. Users/BrentKago

20110510 14:34:09 nbsp I really like this place  good coffee and always a table to sit. But its kind of ridiculous that they automatically give you disposable cups for inhouse drinks (though you can ask for reusable cups). I wish they had more food options too!  Users/MorganA

20110510 15:45:45 nbsp I love this place! They have such good paninis. Try the cloud forest and cache creek caliente paninis. Theyre very good. Users/ElaineJeu

20110706 12:09:49 nbsp My new favorite place to get lunch in Davis.  The atmosphere is nice and the paninis are delicious.  The highlight for me is the fresh juice.  It is so refreshing, especially in the summer.  Flavors are limited, but what they have is great. Users/CaitlinMorrow

20110722 10:02:04 nbsp OMG, their street tacos are fucking brilliant. Seriously. Had 3 orders with my friends last night. Delicious. Users/sfaul

20110807 09:29:07 nbsp I love this place! The lattes are amazing. Even though the prices are a little expensive (think Starbucks prices), they are delicately balanced; sweet and creamy but not to the point where you cant taste the tangy bitterness of the coffee beans. And the paninis are amazing!! I have food allergies so I had to ask them about the ingredients and the girl actually CALLED Village Bakery (where they get their bread made fresh) and asked them for their ingredients. She was so sweet; she pretty much guaranteed my patronage after that.

Its also really quiet and peaceful inside (except when they use the coffee grinder! Its sooooo loud!). Its my favorite place to study and play chess with my friends. They have a rule that you have to keep buying food in order to stay there (like every hour, but if youre quiet and its not too crowded theyre a little more lax about that. Just dont be a jerk.). The music is pretty unobtrusive (unlike Delta of Venus, where the music frequently dominates) and is generally some easygoing classic rock like Alan Parsons Project or Seals & Crofts or the ubiquitous Hotel California (which Ive heard playing in there at least twice), or light pop/rock. Ive never used their wifi, but my friend said it was pretty good, although it can be difficult to find an available plug.

I cant think of any bad things to say about this place. The clientele are a little older here, so you dont have a ton of gabbing teenyboppers. Sometimes it gets really crowded and both the indoor and outdoor seating fill up. They also close pretty early, much earlier than the other coffee shops. I guess my one complaint is that I was there were more seats but thats not really anything they can help. The bathroom is also in a really weird place. You have to go through this hall, up these random stairs. Theres a key you have to use to open it. Users/nutmeg

20110807 13:33:37 nbsp TACO STAND EH? SOUNDS SUPER DELICIOUS  Users/StevenDaubert
  Who knew my favorite sandwich place in Davis served tacos at night?!?!  Must try!!!   Users/CovertProfessor
 I tried some and they are bomb, soft tacos on double soft tortillas, with some meat and green sauce. Simple and clean (well not clean but you get the idear) Daubert

20110807 23:24:59 nbsp Had the pleasure of meeting the owners son not too long ago. He actually said the taco stand is not associated with Cloud Forest. A family member runs the taco stand but Cloud Forest does not actually serve tacos. They are two separate businesses Im pretty sure. I believe the guy who runs the taco stand also works at Cloud Forest but from what I understood, it is not the same thing. Cloud Forest closes much earlier I think. Users/KoalaKaila

20110918 18:35:15 nbsp As you can see I was a huge fan of Cloud Forest Cafe. You can even read my comment from before , and even about 10 comments up. I have even recommended the place to a lot of friends and was on a first name basis with most of the family.

Today was a sad day for me and the Cloud. I brought two friends with me, one who just moved to Davis. What better place to introduce her to but the Cloud Forest Cafe, right? Wrong.
Today I was feeling a salad. Cloud Forest has a great combination of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, lettuce, and home made croutons (My favorite part). There have been 3 times in the past where they run out of croutons and forget to tell me that when I order it. If they do tell me that theyre out of something, I prefer to pay for a sandwich. Today was another croutonless day. They didnt tell me until after they made the salad. One employee was making the croutons so I asked him how long it would take, this guy can sometimes be a little rough with customers. He told me I dont know, 10, 20 minutes? I dont know. So I brought my salad up to the counter and said I could just wait and I also asked him very respectfully if there is a specific time to come to make sure I get croutons, and he said no, yesterday we were so F busy. Pretty rude and inappropriate language for a cafe atmosphere. I mean, Im sorry you were so busy, but isnt that every cafe owners dream? And shouldnt you make sure that you restock supplies for the next day?

Anyways, Plenty of time had past and he finished making my friends sandwiches, which I carried to them. I waited awhile longer and then said Can I just pay you the extra amount and get a sandwich? And he said no you ordered a salad. Then he preceded to throw away my salad.

SO I went back outside, a little flustered by the verbal abuse and anger displayed at a customer. Ive worked at several coffee shops and cafes and I know that when a customer wants something they should be able to get it, especially since they are willing to PAY for it. In the places Ive worked the employee would be fired on the spot. My poor friend who I had hoped would love this little place was completely frustrated for me. My friends kept offering me their sandwiches to which I declined. Then another employee, came out and handed me cash and said that the other employee (who was rude), said to just give me my money back. I then just asked her, can I just give you a quarter extra and get a sandwich (salads are 5.50 sandwiches are 5.75) So she went back inside and the rude employee came out and put my money on the table and said, you have to order from the register. I was frustrated that he would continue to be so rude in front of customers.

But it gets worse.

I start hearing my name Jen being called. But, assuming that there are other Jens in the world, I thought someone else ordered something. But I keep hearing it and I tell my friends, if that guy just made me a sandwich Im going to be upset. He went out of his way to be rude and did not allow me to pay him for a sandwich. If anything he should come out, clarify the situation, and maybe offer up an apology for his rudeness. Nope. Another customer who was sitting with his friends walks in to get his sandwich and comes out and says That employee in there said this was for you. SO unprofessional. I told the customer, Im really sorry he involved you in this but that is not for me. I had ordered a salad, and then tried to pay him for a sandwich when he ran out of croutons, to which he rudely objected, and now he has inappropriately asked you to deliver it to me. I said I was sorry to the man again that he was involved in it, and all of his friends were annoyed with the employee and shocked by his rudeness as well.

Im really sad that this was my experience here today. I really love this cafe and the family that owns it, but I honestly dont want to return there with unprofessional service like that. Everyone else has treated me fairly, and I do think its a great place but I cant believe what happened today. I dont plan on going back for awhile. Users/jenb

20110919 10:49:42 nbsp Its one of the only places in Davis that offers fresh juice.  Now if they could only manage to wash the carrots after I watch them being taken out of the bulk bag.  Nothing like gritty, pesticideladen carrot juice to get the morning started.  Users/s.vignos

20120114 22:46:34 nbsp The coffee is the best in town (regular coffee) the paninis are good, and the orangecranberry scones (which will soon be discontinued, alas) are great.  I practically lived here for finals week and they kept me fed and caffeinated. Users/Mbrowne

20120117 19:20:50 nbsp best freshly squeezed orange juice in town :) Users/ivana.h

20120424  7:41 nbsp Best Tri Tip sandwich in town. Too bad its a special. Should become a regular. Users/DavisSite

20120612 11:26:54 nbsp oh my gosh I love love love this place. I wish I had discovered it more than 5 days before graduating, but this place is awesome. They have plenty of outlets and are really nice about letting you study. Im sure most of this has been said before, but I still have to say it again. Also, the paninis are delicious, and the coffee does not taste watered down like other places Ive been to. Make sure to look in those little coupon books they give out sometimes, they had some for cloud forest cafe this quarter, 5 dollar panini, 7 dollar with small smoothie, 2.25 for a coffee and a cookie! I am going to use all these before finals week ends. Users/ivahw

20120726 14:21:44 nbsp Are they still doing the late night taco thing? Users/CecilioPadilla

20130318 14:35:17 nbsp great smoothies and coffee. they are often out of stock of certain items though. Scones are dry and not very flavorful. Good paninis. Definitely overpriced but good for a splurge.  Users/AnBan

20130520 11:36:20 nbsp I love this place, the coffee is excellent and the sandwiches are very good at a great price. Users/DagonJones

20130620 08:12:36 nbsp I began going here as a freshman for an easy and enjoyable off campus escape but I cannot say that the integrity of the business has survived throughout my four years here. The product has become consistently inconsistent which is a shame because they used to be the one place in town I could always rely on for a spectacular cup of coffee and relaxing atmosphere. (I loved enjoying a Davis afternoon on their peaceful patio) but lately the coffee tastes stale and “forgotten”, in a “I am too lazy to actually brew a quality product for customers because it is the end of the day” sort of way…which leads me to my next issue other than the loss of my perfect cup of brew sigh, the baristas.

The baristas now seem too cool to do their job (I thought that was the baristas at Mishka’s part to play in the Davis independent coffee world?) Anyway, I cannot figure out how certain baristas whom my friends and I always found pleasant and positive have come and gone while the core few that really seem like they hate working there trudge on each day. Seriously it seems like if they manage to hire a barista who actually cares and is good with people they disappear within months. I can only hope they have moved on to bigger and better things and the remaining baristas are bitter and wallow in the fact they themselves have not. They had this one barista for a while who I literally would keep walking by the store and proceed down to Mishka’s or Peet’s if I saw him behind the counter, he was so rude he would be on his cell phone gossiping about customers, complaining about everything and acting as though we the customer were a major inconvenience to his situation. (not to mention he would inappropriately hit on everything that walked in) I had enough of him after I heard him and another one of the girls saying terrible things and making fun of the customers over a mixed up order, really? How unprofessional.

Seriously, the worst experience with customer service I have ever had was with the owner’s daughter. I watched her berate an older man who was hard of hearing because he informed her that his sandwich had been made wrong. The girl blew up in this poor man’s face because she “doesn’t make mistakes”, sounds to me like someone has to come down from the egotistical clouds that are lurking above Cloud Forest and really check themselves back into reality, what happened to the customer is always right?..or at least trying to you know, be nice to customers? Overall it’s a bummer but I really thought that as I said my good byes to my beloved Davis this summer Cloud Forest would be on my top list of things I was going to miss, but I realize I already miss what originally kept me coming back such as;

Reasonable prices for reasonable food (now the prices are crazy considering fact that everything your buying comes from Costco and could be easily assembled at home)
Amazing coffee (which is now subpar and has taken a back seat to the baristas whining about their day to day lives, seriously grow up and leave your problems at the door) and a
Relaxing atmosphere (it’s hard to study for a test or catch up with a friends when you’re hearing the baristas none stop talking about super inappropriate work topics, I have even heard one of the girls talking about her sex life and on another day drug usage)

I am a pretty liberal individual but that does not fly at a café where I sometimes take the kids I babysit. Anyway hopefully when I return they have gotten it together and realized that their livelihood depends on a quality product and just because your daddy and mommy own a coffee shop does not mean you and all your friends are qualified to run it. Go to Zia’s for a cheap and delicious sandwich (less expensive, way fresher and more for your money, plus awesome people) and keep walking down to Mishka’s for a quality cup of coffee.  Users/KelleyStevens

20131103 14:48:57 nbsp Really like this cafe however, unfortunately, I just saw that the person making my salad was not wearing any gloves. That would be fine if she was using tongs and utensils to touch the ingredients, but she wasnt. Bare hands to put the lettuce in the bowl, cut up the ingredients, and so on. I was grossed out and couldnt eat it. With ready to eat food like that, it is not very sanitary to do so. I will plan to just come to study and get drinks but no food.  Users/AlexisMartin

20140504 17:03:33 nbsp Pesto is made with walnuts instead of pine nuts because walnuts are cheaper (we were told this by an employee). This was an issue since they do not advertise this and I went with someone who has a walnut allergy.

Other than that (my friend is fine), the food was tasty. They do not have tofu to beef up a vegetarian sandwich. Service was good and friendly. Users/MKC
