The Cloverleaf Farm is a farms farm located off I80 at the Kidwell Rd. exit (going west it is on the right side of the highway). If you are on your way to Tahoe, Sacramento, San Fransisco, Oakland, Marin or even Oregon, you can jump off the highway and come say hi. The Cloverleaf is located directly behind the Collins Farm Fruit and Vegetable Stands farm stand, where they sell their delicious produce.

Summer 2011 was their first planting season.  They planted sugar baby watermelons, yellow watermelons, purple beans, green beans, black and sungold cherry tomatoes, slicing tomatoes (including Emmas grandfathers Torbert tomato), basil, a plethora of hot peppers and sweet peppers, cantaloupes, eggplants and tomatillos.

This year, the Cloverleaf will be managing an organic stone fruit orchard with peaches, apricots, nectarines and figs for sale for Upick as well as at the farmstand.  The Cloverleaf is partnering with the Collins Farm, which has blackberries, strawberries, peppers, potatoes and onions, and Hearty Fork Farm, which has a diversity of organically certified vegetables.

Emma and Katie are both trained in organic and sustainable agricultural practices and their farm reflects that knowledge. No pesticides, herbicides or inorganic fertilizer are used to grow their crops.

Meet your farmers:

  Emma: Emma began farming in the cold bluster of NH and has discovered that California weather produces tasty tomatoes. She has farmed all over this country (&world!) including PA, WA, NH, Chile, Ecuador, and CA. She got her masters in Horticulture from UCD and currently works for the Agricultural Sustainability Institute. Her dream is to have a cohousing farm someday, and loves all vegetables, compost, and goats!

  Katie:  Katie is a beginning farmer who got her start right here in Davis at Impossible Acres.  She fell into farming after graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Integrative Biology by following her love of plants, sunshine, and digging in the dirtand couldnt be happier about it!  In addition to working at the Cloverleaf, she is also a student at the California Farm Academy at the Center for Land Based Learning in Winters.
