 Club Tucos 
 Not Just Another Wine Club 
 Its a Food and Wine Community 
 Letter From the Owner 
Friends,

For over a year Ive wanted to put together a club, something really fun and different.  Ive wanted the club to help our community provision their cellars and kitchens with the same wonderful wines, cheeses and specialty foods that are so popular at Tucos. Ive also wanted the club to help take us around the world meeting our gifted family of producers, at their homes and experiencing other wonderful establishments that share the same spirit as Tucos.  The following is our invitation for you to join us.  If you’re interested, give us a call at (530) 7576600 or stop by and pick up an information sheet and we’ll take care of the rest.

Ive been subscribed to Club Tucos for about six months and love it!  It runs around $110125/month, and includes six bottles of wine, two cheeses and a gourmet food item.  While I generally focus on securing locally grown organic food, having someone like Pru assemble great affordable food from around the world is wonderful.
