Club Finance Council, or CFC, allocates ASUCD money to UC Davis officially SPAC recognized student organizations student clubs for specific projects, based on the merits of those projects.

Councilmembers act as consultants to hundreds of clubs and assist them with organizing their budget and other supporting documents. The council also maneuvers line items to maximize the clubs chances in getting fund.

Only undergraduates Undergraduate Clubs can receive funding, meaning that the club must have five undergraduates as official officers for the club.  However, the club can have as many graduate student or nonstudent members as it wants, so this really amounts to a meaningless restriction in many cases.

Grad student groups can be funded by the Graduate Student Association through the wiki:ucdgsa:Organizations Fund.

A message from the current Chair of CFC:
Comments made below are all outdated and do not represent the efficiency and ease of navigating through CFC paperwork.
Over 100 clubs applied and received funding in the academic years of 20112012 and 20122013. Over $80,000 were allocated in both of those years. This represents how informed most student organizations are about CFC and the unrestricted ease for applying for funds.


20050421 18:42:30 nbsp If youve ever wondered why people dislike ASUCD and/or SPAC, look no further than CFC. This program successfully scares people away from asking for funding simply by showing how much nonsense you have to go through to get even minimal funding. This is truly a level of bureaucracy that would make Big Brother jealous. Users/JonathonLeathers

20050421 19:54:35 nbsp I second that. I looked into getting CFC financing for the Aggie Micro Aeronatuics club and fled in terror. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050421 23:09:21 nbsp CFC is the biggest bureaucratic nightmare on campus. Its not worth the time spent trying to fill out one of their applications or attend their meetings/Inquisition to get money for your club.  Users/AshleyOrsaba

  Hi, I dont know you, but youre a public official and youre calling me names. Perhaps you should be removed from office. Why should I let someone who insults me spend my money? I did research getting funding, and I took the time to read over all the SPAC information and sat through and paid attention to the entire meeting with Steven. After reading through the material and sitting through the meeting, I decided that 1) SPAC wouldnt give the Aggie Microaeronautics team funding, and 2) Even if they were going to give us the $2000, it would be easier to seek department/corporate sponsorship than jump through their hoops.

   I could be wrong, but I believe the ASUCD Senate has the ability to remove CFC board members. Users/BrentLaabs
    The CFC Statutes and Procedures only outline removal by a 2/3 majority vote of the CFC board.  Thats not to say that ASUCD cant lobby for the removal of specific members of CFC.  ASUCD also has a role in the selection of board members (just like it has a role in the selection of Media Board members...) PRH

20060412 00:08:05 nbsp Could we get a list of CFC board members and officers? Users/PaulHarms

20060412 00:18:28 nbsp A fair amount of bureaucracy is necessary in CFC; ASUCD expects the Club Finance Council to distribute ASUCD funds to student clubs in a fair and unbiased manner.  ASUCD uses the CFC to avoid the problems faced by ASUC at UC Berkeley, where funds are distributed directly by the ASUC Senate.

That being said, CFC has a serious image problem in many circles. BOARD MEMBERS OF THE CLUB FINANCE COUNCIL SHOULD BE MORE DIPLOMATIC IN ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF CLUB LEADERS, ASUCD OFFICIALS, AND THE PUBLIC.  IT IS, AFTER ALL, THEIR MONEY (FROM STUDENT FEES) BEING ALLOCATED.

I doubt anyone can argue with that, and I encourage to edit the above comment and bring a friendlier tone to this discussion. Users/PaulHarms, ASUCD Internal Affairs
