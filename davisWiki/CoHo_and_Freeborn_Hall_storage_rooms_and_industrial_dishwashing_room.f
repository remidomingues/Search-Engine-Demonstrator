The entry to this side of Lower Freeborn is at the west near the loading dock. The lower room containing the industrial dishwasher is taken over once every year by the Karma Patrol subgroup that manages the returnable dish program for the Whole Earth Festival.

Though the room is beneath the CoHo, its the part of the MU operated by Sodexho and its catering division.

20101030 00:33:39 nbsp yes, pretty sure coho renovations did nothing to catering side of dishwasher area, I know they have a portable washing room moored in place at the loading dock as well  Users/StevenDaubert

20101030 09:02:03 nbsp It was my understanding that the mobile dishwasher was placed there to at least temporarily replace the dishwashing part of the catering op but that was back in june and I havent been back to look. Hopefully an adventurous person will go and find out.  Users/ARWENNHOLD
