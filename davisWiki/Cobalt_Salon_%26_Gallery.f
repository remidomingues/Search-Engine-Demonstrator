20100416 21:14:24 nbsp I have been devoted to Davids hair styling since I moved to Davis and feel that I was so lucky to have chosen him. I trust him completely and he never fails to put a smile on my face when I get out of his salon. Not only he is in total command of his craft, he completely devotes himself to make his clients happy. The quality of his professional work is exceptional.   Users/ascaglione@ucdavis.edu

20100929 16:01:11 nbsp David is WONDERFUL!  I got a hair cut with him as a gift from a friend and I couldnt be happier.  He is professional, funny, kind, and really knows about hair!  My boyfriend decided he finally needed to cut off his pony tail but was nervous as he hadnt had short hair in nearly a decade.  He went to David for a consult and cut and came away with a great cut that works perfectly with his type of hair.  I would highly recommend David! Users/SaraRoscoe

20110322 08:30:12 I try to search for a good salon in Davis. First of all, I chose Luci salon because my friends said they know how to style your hair. However, as I went online, I saw lots of good reviews about the Cobalt salon, so I decided to change my mind and go to this salon instead. It turns out that I got the worst haircut ever from this place. Although I brought the picture with me to the place, my haircut turns out so short and not even looks like the picture. It is completely a crazy short hair without any styling or any creative,or not even look like the pictures that I brought ( I brought 2 pictures, but if its not possible to cut as the pix, just tell me before the process, and dont say that its possible, but then it turns out to be worst at the end)The fullness of the hair in the back is also weird; the half top is flatted, and the half bottom is having fullness. My mom and aunts also agree so. I was crying whenever I look at the mirror.

I have to go to my regular stylist to ask if he can fix it for me, but it is impossible because if he fixes the hair, it will even shorter. Afterward, I had to go to Sally to ask for a shampoo to induce hair grow so it can grow faster and i can fix it. This is the first time that I have to pay for an expensive haircut and I dont like it at all. Im so disappointed, upset, and sorry for my self for not going to the suggested salon or stay with my stylist in my hometown.... So, Be careful with all the good reviews online.
PS. the owner, Davis is nice and friendly, hes just not a good hair stylist Chau Doan

Ms. Doan, I am so very sorry for your bad experience with your haircut.  As I stated in the email I sent you, I would be happy to  refund your money if you do not want me to fix any problems with your cut.
 David Martin, owner

20110323 20:29:51 nbsp The owner of Cobalt Salon, David Martin, has been my hair stylist for several years now.  He is the best hair stylist I have ever had!  I originally went to him because I needed a change and have been very happy ever since.  He is great with color and always has great suggestions for the changing seasons.  I have very straight and thin hair, and therefore I need a very precise haircut.  His are always perfect.  I have had both long and short hairstyles with him and he is great at both.  He is also a very nice guy and I always enjoy chatting with him during my appointments.  I actually have never posted a review online before this one, but I feel so strongly about my experiences that I feel I need to share them with others.   Users/MHY

20110323 21:12:54 nbsp David Martin who owns Cobalt Salon and Gallery has been taking care of me for the last 6 months. I cannot say enough positive things about him and the work that he does. I initially saw him on the advise of a friend, who has been thrilled with his work for 10 years.  He did a wonderful job with my hair. David really cares about people, and it shows with the way that he treats his clients, and with the work that he does. I am a very happy, continuingtoreturnreferringallmyfriends client. Thanks David!Karen V Users/KarenVernau

20110323 22:18:16 nbsp HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:  David Martin, owner of Cobalt Salon & Gallery, has been my stylist for several years and my husbands stylist for over ten years.  His haircuts are exceptional and reflect a high level of skill and years of experience. Hes confident, professional and never hurried or distracted.  David always gets a good concept of what I want and executes it perfectly.  I trust him completely and wouldnt go to anyone else...period.      Users/KristinBabcock

20110324 00:12:00 nbsp I just moved to Davis as a transfer student and I came across Cobalt after a friend recommended David specifically.  David is patient, skilled, and a genuinely friendly person.  I HIGHLY recommend him. Users/michaelpearce

20110324 08:19:54 nbsp Id previously left a good review on Davids own Wiki page (before Cobalt existed) and wanted to reiterate those comments here: David has been my stylist for over two years now and I have only had good experiences. My comments are genuine; Im not the most prolific reviewer, so someone has to be highly wonderful or utterly terrible for me to leave feedback. In the event of a less than positive experience, I would speak to the person/business concerned before posting negative comments and give them a chance to rectify the mistake, its the responsible thing to do. I dont wish to demean the review of the lady who was unhappy with her cut (I have been in that situation in the past and its not fun) , but I feel strongly about supporting local, small businesses and one bad review can cancel out twenty good ones.  Sorry, I am rambling, in short (in my personal experience), David is highly skilled both with cutting techniques and colour, I must have been asked by at least six friends for his number after theyd seen my hair.         Users/LizA

20110324 09:05:38 nbsp I highly recommend David Martin for his skill and talent working with my hair (for over 25 years) as well as my daughters (for 20 years beginning at age 2). He has always gone the extra mile for us.  I wish everyone could see the amazing style he did for my daughers Senior Ball at DHS.  The style involved putting tiny crystals on wires and meticulously weaving them through her hair. It was a work of art and at the same time a gesture that boosted her confidence that she would be beautiful for her special event. My daughter, although she now lives in Los Angeles, will still only have David cut her hair.  Over the years as our hair changed, Davids color and style suggestions have adapted to bring out the most flattering cut and shape.  I greatly appreciate his honesty and professionalism in answering all questions.  It still amazes me how Davids cuts will last the 6 weeks between visits and maintain the style without looking ragged.  Through all the years Ive always been treated with the utmost courtesy during my visits and David is always on time.  I appreciate that very much. The salon itself is a very relaxing place. I am always offered and served coffee or water and it makes me feel pampered. The walls are covered with beautiful art and the atmosphere is filled with friendly people who obviously enjoy working together. Since David opened Cobalt Salon, he has held several receptions featuring paintings and crafts from local artisans. I highly suggest putting your hair and style concerns in the hands of David Margin and Cobalt Salon. Users/MarilynSilva

20110324 11:56:00 nbsp GREAT SALON! Not only was it the best haircut Ive ever had, but he was able to give me great styling advice for different ways of wearing my new do.  My boyfriends mom has been using David for years and wont let anyone else touch her hair.  Now I know why, hes absolutely great.  Ill be headed in for my next cut soon, and talking to him about hiring him for our upcoming wedding! Users/SaraRoscoe

20110325 11:27:15 nbsp Dearest Ms. Doan,
Apparently David is not the stylist for you.
But he is for me and has been for nearly 10 years!  I have NEVER left Davids chair disappointed!  Infact, I have always left with a positive and uplifting look and attitude.
My most recent cut was last month and involved the addition of bangs  I love them and have received many complements.  Before that I tried the Brazilian Blow Out and received just as many complements!!  These ideas, of course, were Davids and he executed them perfectly  as always!  My hair is always styled so great!I leave feeling like a rock star!
I trust Davids oppinion and ability to create, style, and cut hair.  He also listens to my ideas of what I need my hair to do for me  I am a mother, swimmer, runner, wife and need my hair to function in many different arenas.  Davids ability with hair is like beacon of creative light that I want to follow for he is forever on the cusp of creativity like never before!!
David Rocks!

     Credit where its due, Kristin Harris suggested the bangs, I just cut them!

20110326 11:56:29 nbsp Davids been cutting my hair for well over 15 years, and Ive never received anything other than a fabulous cut from him. My hair is unevenly curly: almost straight in places, wavy to very curly, in others. Really, its mostly lots of cowlicks! Ive had more bad haircuts in my life than I care to remember. But from the very first haircut, David always knew exactly how to cut my hair to make it look its best. Hes also one of the nicest and most honest people youll ever meet.  I wont let anyone else touch my hair! Users/LynneOFox

20110409 16:39:46 nbsp I had my hair done today by the lovely Kristin Harris.  The experience was my first at Cobalt and Im very happy with the results!  With a little help from David, they matched my color perfectly (I had gone from blonde to red and back a few months ago that needed some correcting) and Kristin gave me a playful summer cut that Im very excited about!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  ) Users/ReeseLayton

20110702 23:56:05 nbsp While I havent been a customer (my wife likes me in a rugged look, and out of love, I happily oblige and merely trim my full beard in a mirror myself), I stopped by once and was struck by how bright and airy the place is.  If I were to have to sit for awhile (say, getting hair styled), this would be a great atmosphere to do it in. Users/JabberWokky

20120403 09:41:37   I am so happy with my haircut from Tenaya. I went with a super short pixie cut from almost shoulder length head of hair. I originally was going to get allovercolor and do the free haircut. Since I was cutting so much off, we did that first. What was left was my natural hair color since I had been growing out my dyed hair. I couldnt believe how much darker my hair was now. We decided I didnt need the color and the short cut was enough of a change. I am so excited about this new style. Its like a million little pieces, layers upon layers —like a work of art! I also bought some spray on wax for $15 and that has helped me style, spike it the way I like it. I would definitely recommend the pixie hair cut for anyone looking for something new. So much potential! Thanks Tenaya! —JenniferStanton

20130702 13:48:04 nbsp David Martin has been my stylist for less than a year but has seen me through many a hairstyle change!  Short aline, asymmetrical aline, pixie, faux hawk  with each and every hairstyle he has created has come more compliments than I have EVER received in my life prior to going to him. In all honesty, rarely does a day go by when I am out that I dont get complimented or asked who cuts my hair!  David has always been so patient, since day one, to help me figure out what look Im going for and then has executed it so fabulously!  One of the saddest things about moving across the country in the near future is that I have to leave Cobalt. Come with me, David!!! Users/CatieA

20140315 19:30:19 nbsp I had the most wonderful haircut, color and highlights from Ms. Michelle White.  Not only is she engaging, friendly, enthusiastic and obviously has a passion for her craft, she is extremely talented.  I completely trusted her with choosing the best color for me and my results were truly magical.  I learned more about hair and the importance of using professional products and how to keep my hair healthy in one session from Michelle than I ever did in my lifetime.  Cobalt Salon truly has a gem in this salon and I will be coming back to see Michelle and I will be sending my friends and family to come see her.  Loved the experience!!
