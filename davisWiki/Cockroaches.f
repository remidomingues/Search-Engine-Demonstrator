Cockroaches, or just roaches (no, not marijuana that kind!), are sweet little insects that live and flourish in the pleasant Davis weather.  Like most insects, most people consider then pernicious vermin when they enter your home, and go to great measures to remove them or exterminators have them removed.

Although cockroaches are commonly associated with filthy places, like sewers and garbage heaps, and have been to proven to be capable of mechanically transporting pathogens to food (through their habit of running over your food with dirty feet, feeding on your food while defecating, and periodically vomiting), cockroaches have never been tied to any actual disease outbreaks. However, cockroach exuvia (discarded exoskeletons) have been proven to be a contributing factor to asthma and allergies, especially in young children.

And lastly, according to a study by Cochran and Ross, German cockroaches can withstand radiation between 6000 and 9000 rads, about 6 times higher than the fatal dose for humans. Unfortunately for the roaches though, modern nuclear weapons release radiation several magnitudes greater than both our tolerances. If a nuclear apocalypse rolls around, were all screwed.

Cockroach Control

UC Davis has some great info http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7467.html here about how to manage roaches in your home.

Tired of roaches scurrying across your kitchen floor when you turn on the light at night?
Davis cockroaches are easily controlled with duct tape and cat food.  Heres how.


Roach Trapping 101


1. Get some cardboard, duct tape, and moist cat food.
2. Feed most of the food to your cat, or a neighbors cat (purr purr purr).
3. Get a square of cardboard, about 1 foot square.  Or masonite, coroplast, anything will do.
4. Lay strips of duct tape upside down on the cardboard, overlapping on each other, then tape them down with a strip along the ends.
5. Sprinkle on roach attractant powder (optional) (flour, sugar, boric acid and roach hormone, available from Ace Hardware (called Safer: Roach and ant killing powder), the flour and sugar tastes good, the hormone makes them think theyll get some action, and enough Boric Acid will plug up their innards).
6. Put down a few small globs of cat food.
7. Slide under your stove, under your fridge, under the washer, under the dryer, under cabinets, in the utility closet.  Put them on the ground.  Anywhere where you dont normally walk, and your cat or dog wont get into it.
8. Check them the next morning, see if theres some stuck roaches.
9. Dispose at your convenience, according to your own preference.  To kill the roaches before disposal, fold the cardboard, put it in a plastic bag, and step on it before putting it in the trash.

Benefits
While its not too enchanting to have a bunch of roaches slowly dying under your stove, it sure beats the alternative.
 You dont need to look at them.
 You dont need strong pesticides.
 It contains the dead roaches it makes cleaning easy.  (With pesticides theyll just crawl into a corner a die)
 Its very inexpensive.
 Its not as gross as having them wandering all over your house at night...


Other thoughts

1. I dont have mice or rats.  Are rats attracted to moist cat food?  Could be a problem.
2. I dont have ants.  If you do have ants, the cat food will attract them.  Maybe you can trap an army of ants this way, maybe notdepends if they stick to the duct tape.  Has anyone tried it?
3. Theres probably other baits that will attract roaches but not ants, if it turns out the ants dont stick to duct tape.
4. Exterior control.  The roaches seem to breed outside, then come in as adults (in my house, anyway).  Theres about 500 wandering around my bock on any given night, about $5 worth of duct tape and traps in petproof locations might solve the problem before they ever get into the house.  I put a cardboard trap in the water meter sump by the street.  They seem to love it in there.  It filled up in one night.  So Im trying it again, and Im going to try putting them in my and my two neighbors sumps, too.  Well see if we can make a dent in the outside population.
5. If you have wooden structures in the backyard, like a hottub surround, put a trap in there, too.  Under a wooden floor in a garden shed, etc.  Duct tape is cheap.
6. One thing I have seen against using sticky traps for peridomestic roaches outside is that other insects, snakes and lizards could get trapped.

Cockroach Species


Species found in Davis include
 The American Cockroach (Periplaneta americana)

These are probably the largest of the cockroaches in Davis, outside of the Bohart Museum of Entomology, and are distinguished by the distinctive splotch on its pronotum, or back. These roaches are also equipped with two pairs of leathery wings, which they rarely use, and three pairs of legs, which propel the roach at up to 3.4 miles per hour. This gives them, what is estimated by some, to be the fastest proportional landspeed of any organism, 50 body lengths each second. Although this species is called the American cockroach (or occasionally called the Palmetto bug), it is believed to have originated in Northern Africa, and traveled on ships (and other forms of human transport) around the world. They seem to prefer dark and moist environments, such as sewers. They are commonly bred and used in a similar fashion to lab rats. Such experiments tell us that not only can an American cockroach live a week without a head, but that they also apparently still maintain rudimentary learning skills without a head, thanks to the distribution of the nervous system throughout an insects body.

 The German Cockroach (Blatella germanica)

These, on the other end of the spectrum, are the smallest of the peridomestic cockroaches here in Davis, measuring in at only about 1/2 an inch in length. On their pronotum are a pair of parallel stripes. Like the American cockroach, they rarely fly and also prefer damp environments. Likewise, the common name is a misnomer, this species being believed to have originated somewhere in Africa as well. These are the cockroaches spotlighted in cockroach reproduction horror stories, since each female can produce, at highest estimate, 352 young in a single lifetime, higher than the maximum total young for other common peridomestic species. So if you see one little German roach, you can easily assume there are likely, many, many, many nearby.

 The Oriental Cockroach (Blatta orientalis)

These are the darker cockroaches which lack distinguishing marks on their pronoutum altogether. The females, interestingly enough, have only short stubs for wings, whereas the males have long wings. However, like the other species, they do not appear to take to the air. These cockroaches like moist places, and like the American cockroach, are fond of sewers. Also like the American cockroach, this species is believed to have originated in Africa.

 Other Roaches (Blattaria)

There are likely other roaches to be found in Davis, as other species of cockroach are often coveted as pets, or as food for reptilian and amphibious pets. In the Bohart Museum of Entomology you can see specimens of Gromphadorhina portentosa, or the Madgascan Hissing Cockroach, a slowmoving and docile roach, which is a popular pet. Also, you may see Blaberus craniifer the Deaths Head cockroach, called so because of the skull like markings on its dorsal surface, or Blaberus giganteus, known as the Cockroach of the Divine Face. It may be one or the other...

Comments

Why are there so many cockroaches in Davis? My wife lived in Sacramento for 3 years and staying with her, I never saw a cockroach. Here it seems that there are out everywhere at night in the summer.
 They are native to this area, in Sacramento there is probably a higher concentration of abatement spraying. Davis is a little more wild than the concrete jungle. ~SD
