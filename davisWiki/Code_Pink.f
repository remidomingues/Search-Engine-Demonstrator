Code Pink, or CODEPINK, is a women initiated grassroots peace and social justice Davis Politics movement that seeks positive social change through proactive, creative Protests protest and nonviolent direct action.

Their current campaign is the Mandate for Peace.  In their words, we insist that the newly elected Congress in its earliest days in office pass legislation requiring the prompt removal of all US troops from Iraq and discontinue funding for military purposes in Iraq except the safe withdrawal of all U.S. forces.

Code Pink is now in the process of strengthening the regional offices, developing new decisionmaking structures, providing greater support to local groups, doing outreach to get more women involved, and developing new campaigns.
