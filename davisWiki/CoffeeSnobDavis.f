I dont drink bad coffee. Most people would call me a coffee snob.

http://coffeesnobdavis.com  My public service blog about the current state of coffee in Davis. If you are a coffee snob, I tell you where not to waste your time and money in search of good coffee in Davis. If good coffee is ever found, Ill let you know that too.

http://espressomap.com/  Nearby cafes that serve good coffee.


I love your coffee comments here.  I moved to SF from Davis a couple years ago and Ive been spoiled rotten by Blue Bottle, Ritual and my home french press (with freshly roasted, nonoverroasted beans).  Whenever I go back to Davis Im surprised by the low coffee quality, but I think its like that in most of the world.  The only other nonSF great coffee Ive had was at Cafe Grumpy in NYC (even Eugenes Wandering Goat Cafe seemed overroasted to me).

The sad part is that this means all these people havent experienced what coffee can really taste like (or just dont care).  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20090908 17:02:37 nbsp i too, love your coffee comments. i havent found anywhere that has a barista that can pull a proper espresso (with the thick head of crema that i yearn for) though i havent bothered looking, after seeing many of your comments. if you have any suggestions that save me the drive to the bay area, i would love to hear any (sac maybe?). until then ill stick to my reliable french press, and indulge when i am away from here. thanks for bothering to review so many places.

20090908 21:46:07 nbsp I loved your comment about meat cakes. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090914 09:19:57 nbsp thanks, ill try temple the next time im out that way. why is vegan asian panda redundant? all pandas are technically asian and vegan? Users/MiranPark

20091225 11:56:00 nbsp more coffee reviews please! Peetes is lacking your touch Users/StevenDaubert

20091226 09:16:11 nbsp By far, imho, the best spot in town is Konditorei.  The problem with many other places is thamthey vary over the years.  Mishkas was great at one point but high staff turnover has always made it fluxuate. Users/WesHardaker
    I left out Konditorei because I have not tried their coffee in 2 years. If memory serves me correctly, they scored about a D+. Good pastries though. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis
        Let me know when you try it again.  Take a straight espresso and rate it.  Do not get it to go though, which quickly ruins any espresso drink.  If you dont like it, then Ill know our tastes differ enough that I should ignore the rest of your ratings!

20091226 09:53:05 nbsp Dont forget there are two Peets outlets in Davis; I assume youre grading the downtown, but if you make it out to the Marketplace shopping center you might wish to give it a try. Users/DonShor
    I have tried both. The Marketplace Peets is about on par with the rest of the Peets I have tried, D+. The downtown Peets gave me something more like motoroil. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20091226 14:16:14 nbsp This might be blasphemy, but what do you rate McDonalds coffee (the one at North Davis tastes weaker compared to most locations Ive been to)? Ive always liked coffee from McDonalds better than the stuff served at Starbucks. Users/hankim
    It isnt blasphemy, but it isnt saying much. Better than Starbucks  Not ENTIRELY nasty coffee. If you enjoy McDonalds coffee, be happy. Do you really want me to rate them? Users/CoffeeSnobDavis
         I guess curiosity did kill the cat. Users/hankim

20100106 14:41:21 nbsp Was surprised, yet not surprised by how low the scored on here were. On a whim I checked out your espressomap and was happy to find Barefoot Coffee (My family live near there) on your list, so Im going to try Old Soul in Sacramento on Thursday.  Users/AlvinTsao
    I did not create that espressomap, but I do agree that almost all the cafes on there serve good to great coffee. I grew up in San Jose, but discovered Barefoot after I moved out :(. Let me know what you think of Old Soul, Ive never tried it personally and have heard conflicting reviews. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20100130 11:48:10 nbsp Hey, Ive seen you pop into IRC a couple times.  Stick around to chat  were friendly. Users/JabberWokky

20100222 22:11:52 nbsp the website is a nice touch (both practically and aesthetically) and i hope people find it a useful resource. i still havent found myself near any cafes in sac but have managed to find drinkable espresso in my hometown, and ill likely be moving to la soon where i can get real espresso. i wish you luck in davis, maybe more good baristas will swing into town in the future.   Users/MiranPark
    just dropping a line: an espresso machine setup is one of the best investments i have ever made. if you have the time and/or the interest (and the finances i suppose, though theres an assumed $$$ exchange with the bad espresso youre no longer purchasing at cafes) i highly recommend it. even http://i47.tinypic.com/73nz2h.jpg my first shot was about 10x better than anything ive had in davis, though i do admit there is something about having a good espresso shot in the ambiance of a cafe, and its unfortunate that that cant be had here. Users/MiranPark

20100727 21:04:05 nbsp haha that was literally my first shot ever pulled (dont worry, it didnt taste quite as good as it looked; i dont have magic barista superpowers). funny you mention the m4, i just got my hands on an old mazzer super jolly today. my espresso machine is fairly low end too (starbucks barista a.k.a. saeco via venezia) but again, better than anything in davis. maybe you should do some coffee consulting for local cafes, itd do so much good for this town :/. Users/MiranPark
    thought id share my first attempt at a pour from today...http://i31.tinypic.com/j7ust4.jpg some kind of awful rosetta/heart hybrid attempt, when i realized i actually had microfoam. it took some coaxing but i got some velvet smoothness (on soymilk, heresy, i know, more for art than for drinking) out of this machine and hopefully the ones to come will be better. its unfortunate that i have so little time left here or i would have tried to be a barista locally part time, if only to play with some underworked espresso machines.
