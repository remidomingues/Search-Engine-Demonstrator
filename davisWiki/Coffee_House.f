The ASUCD Coffee House, or CoHo for short, is the largest studentrun Restaurants restaurant in the United States. They do some ridiculous number of transactions (around 7,000 customers) per day.  The coffee, supplied by Beantrees Beantrees roasting company, is delicious, organic, fair trade coffee fair trade and shadegrown, and can be found at the Bakery coffee station.  The Deli coffee station now features Pachamama coop grown coffee. The Coffee House is home to a few microwaves you can use to heat up your food.  As the name would imply, the ASUCD Coffee House is run by ASUCD rather than Sodexho.  Being run by ASUCD, it is technically a nonprofit restaurant, so at the end of the year any extra money goes back into the ASUCD coffers to fund other student services. You cannot pay with your Reg Card at the CoHo.

Local food and bakeries provide a large number of products in addition to the fare prepared in house.  The Student Farm, Village Bakery, Variety Donuts (Mmmm... donuts!), and nearby Woodlands wiki:woodland:El Sombrero all kick in tasty items.  Crossing the river, Sacramento sends items from wiki:sacramento:Main Street Bagels, wiki:sacramento:Sacramento Tofu Company, wiki:sacramento:Beantrees,  and a bit of the juice of the Cows moo from wiki:sacramento:Crystal Cream and Butter.

Further afield, from Vacaville comes wiki:vacaville:Pure Grain Bakery, Richvales Lundberg Farms, Portello Ranch of Arbuckle, and wiki:yubasutter:Marysvilles own Rue and Forsman Ranch all provide regional items and ingredients.

The entire CoHo was closed down in summer 2009 for a massive renovation.  Food service was available (though limited) from stations scattered throughout the first floor of the Memorial Union.  Come Fall of 2010, the new and improved CoHo reopened with all new food and beverage options, a greatly improved, more open floor plan, and some pleasant, modern decor.

About the Coffee House
The Coffee House serves not only as a central location for students to meet (its hard to hang out in the CoHo and NOT see someone you know), but also a venue for the ASUCD Entertainment Council. While CoHo shows arent what they used to be (Between 1977 to 1981: Iggy Pop, The Ramones, Devo, The Police, Dire Straits, EmmyLou Harris, Talking Heads (played twice), and Elvis Costello on 02/08/78), Entertainment Council still manages to land a good number of Music Scene bands such as http://www.nadasurf.com/ Nada Surf.

In addition, Davis Music Scene hosts weekly shows featuring local and touring bands at the Coffee House regularly.

 Reserving Coffee House Space 

Students may reserve the dining areas. Even during the day sections can be reserved for events, for example ASUCD has their candidate forums during lunch. In the evenings, the entire space is available for reservation. The rooms are not under the control of Center for Student Involvement, but of Coffee House management. Speak to staff Coffee House Managers Darin to reserve space. Students can also request to put flyers in the plastic holders on each table and request to put posters up on empty wall space.

 CoHo Employee Culture 

There are two types of employees that work at the CoHo, Kitchen and Out Front. The kitchen employees work in the Hot Kitchen, Cold Kitchen, CoHo Bakery Bakery and Hot food line. The Out Front employees are cashiers (who also make the espresso) or work at the counters making burritos, bagels, sandwiches, coffee, and pho. Kitchen supervisors and managers wear blue aprons, Out Front supervisors and managers wear red aprons and all nonsupervisor/manager employees wear white aprons.

Coffee House employees are known for having some of the best parties and social events in town such as Holy Land, CoHo Formal, Talent Show, Keg Race and Sloshball games. The CoHo has a perfect sloshball record against other entities on campus; the CoHo has defeated both KDVS and Unitrans. When not playing other entities on campus the CoHo plays itself: Kitchen versus Out Front. During the Summer of 2007 the CoHo beat ARC employees at a keg race. They brutally defeated the Ski or Snowboard club at keg racing in Fall of 2007. They are professionals at the top of their game. Their next match is a sloshball game versus Unitrans employees. They are slated to destroy. One of the reasons CoHo employees are so good at dominating in any form of drinking (especially compared to Unitrans) is that they can work while drunk. Therefore their few seconds of sobriety consists of the time between waking up after a 10hour drinking binge and sipping on the beer used to rinse their mouths out when brushing their teeth in the morning. We work hard, we play harder, cheers OutFront supervisor Elyse Greenblatt. They truly are professionals in eatery service and drinking.

 PreRenovation 
Prior to the 20092010 renovation, the Coffee House offered (working from West to East) bagels at the MU Bagel Place, coffee, sandwiches deli sandwiches, a salad bar, baked potatoes, and pho.  The Coffee House was (and still is) a part of the larger Memorial Union structure.

Around the corner you could find the CoHo Bakery which offered coffee, tea, hot chocolate, ice cream and frozen yogurt by the ounce, and of course, baked goods. They also sold the Campus Mugs Coffee House Campus Mug.

Continuing North, you would find the Coffee House Too.  Since its the worst name ever, people either called it The Grill or just thatpartofthecoffeehousethatsellsburritosandstuff. Thatpartofthecoffeehousethatsellsburritosandstuff sold burritos, quesadillas, tacos, nachos, pizza, egg rolls, bread sticks, breakfast burritos (if you got there early), and various items served from bins at the hot food line, including chili, casserole, soup, quiche, salads, and pasta. The http://coffeehouse.ucdavis.edu/menu/hotfood Hot Food Line Menu is updated daily before 10:30am (its still maintained as the Cooks station in the new CoHo).


History

The Coffee House closed its doors for one whole day in the Spring of 2002. This radical display was a move to strike against the ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senates decision to enlist a full time chef, which would have taken the power from students as well as the belief that the very popular kitchen manager Darin Schluep would be fired. It is estimated that thousands of dollars were lost in that one day of closure. The following day then ASUCD President ChiaSaun Lai and the Coffee House reached an agreement. Out went the full time chef idea and the CoHo opened its doors again.

Aggie Cash is now accepted by the CoHo, starting somewhere around the 201314 school year.

On October 11, 2006, around 9pm two individuals stole the CoHo piano by rolling it out the doors. The two men were caught on film as well as seen by one CoHo employee. On the morning of October 12th two of the staff managers recognized the individuals as the the poster sellers on the MU Patio. The police were called and the eyewitness identified them. When the police arrived one of the alleged thieves fled on foot and was subsequently chased by one of the CoHo staff managers. Both suspects were caught and arrested for allegedly stealing the piano. The posters and merchandise were  held on the fifth floor of the Memorial Union for over five months until the east coastbased company retrieved them.

CoHo Live occurs every Monday in the Coffee House II from 57 pm.

The CoHo used to be home to the daily discussion group Snack Time.  Itd be a good place to host such meetings in the future...

 The Renovation Period 

Renovation work on the ASUCD Coffee House began on August 17th, 2009, and continued until Fall 2010.  Temporary, reduced service was provided in the MU East Wing, where the Post Office and Aggie Student Store were previously located.  See http://coffeehouse.ucdavis.edu/about/news Coffee House Renovation Update Page for more detailed details.

The temporary kitchens outside wall is the Memorial Union Community Mural.



  Gotta love ice cream or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!

Coffee House/Comment Archive Comments before reopening after major remodeling in 2010


20101013 21:05:37 nbsp I propose most of this page moved to a subsection called Coffee House (pre2010). The new Coffee House needs a new page with updated pictures, stations, prices, and layout. Users/mperkel

20101014 14:00:29 nbsp I retired from the Univ. 20 years ago, and the Coffee HOuse is the only thing I miss.  I ate my suppers there for many years.
I have their first two ASUCD Coffee House Cookbooks.  Have they published a 3rd edition recently? Users/PatKeehn

20101015 14:16:06 nbsp Burritos at the old CoHo were great, but the new ones are TERRIBLE. Tortilla wasnt cooked, they only put little scoops of rice/beans/chicken in, and whats worse, they didnt mix them around so it was just blob of rice, blob of beans, blob of chicken. Dont waste your time with this place, just go to Chipotle instead. So far it seems like the new CoHo is just flashier decorations covering up worse food. UCD should have just kept the old one. Users/Kuni
  Actually this happened with the old CoHo too. It just depended on who made your burrito. There were a few people who knew how to spread the stuff on a tortilla before rolling it up and more people who just put every ingredient into an individual ball. I did however get a pretty bad quesadilla yesterday, absolutely no meat or cheese and mainly salsa.Users/hankim

20101026 11:26:28 nbsp Not sure what it is about the food here but I am always left with a bad aftertaste in my mouth whenever I eat anything here. Also, the cakes are a little dense. Users/hankim
  Food are made by students, sometimes they screw up I guess. They also only reopened recently so everyone is really freshly trained. Theyre also quite overpriced.Users/ClarenceL
   Actually its always been like this to me. Users/hanskim

20101028 00:39:11 nbsp Update to my previous comment  A taco bell chicken burrito ($1.29) is roughly equivalent to the standard CoHo burrito in terms of size and amount of meat (CoHos does have beans, though). Also, at Taco Bell they heat the tortilla. You decide whether to get the $3.99 CoHo burrito or the $1.29 Taco Bell one. Users/Kuni

20101028 09:15:46 nbsp First time Ive been able to eat at the Coho.  Ive had only the hot food at Cooks.  So far their Asianinfluenced meals remind me of the sort of thing that I used to get at a military dining hall.  The sort of entrée youd never hope to get at a Chinese restaurant, and yet, for $1.99 more, you can get a great lunch with leftovers at such a restaurant.  So Im not sure that their Asianinfluenced hot meals are worth the cash (particularly their Large).  Its more rice than anything, and the rice gets the heatlamp treatment for far too long.  On the plus side, their large does fill me up.  But as mentioned, it isnt particularly good. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20101028 11:30:34 nbsp So I have been trying to eat here for convenience this week and I have to say that I am not very impressed. The pizza is almost a third crust and leaves that funny aftertaste that microwave pizzas leave behind. The bagels are really dry (they also fall apart really easily) and the fowl and tuna salads are flavorless. The burritos just completely drip all over the place (probably the salsa) yet have no flavor at all. Basically just a soggy mess for five dollars. I did not even bother with the pho because of how it looked and the sushi is quite overpriced.  Users/hankim

No, I really suggest you try the curry pho with tofu. Its really good. Try a sample if you dont feel like spending 6 dollars on something you may not like. Im a picky eater but the pho is def worth a try. Its like the only thing in the coho that doesnt leave me feeling sick/grossed out afterwards. Users/RebelYell

  I actually disagree, the pho left me feeling ripped off. Ive had ramen that tasted better and definitely cheaper than the CoHo pho. Of course stray away from the regular pho, but the curry pho isnt the best but is better than the regular pho. IMO, I like the sandwiches and bagels the most. Users/ClarenceL

20110103 14:49:06 nbsp I had a burrito that tasted like it was made by a member of the Klu Klux Klan, not to say that the person who assembled it was racist but the people who came up with the recipes was extremely white (culturally speaking).

20110119 12:43:59 nbsp I enjoy the coffee house as a place to catch up on work, read, or just enjoy the fast, wireless internet. But the actual food, as others have already elaborated on, leaves a lot to be desired.

It seems as if the CoHo is very intent on marketing itself as sustainable, local, hip, environmentally friendly, a deviation from those big soulless corporate food chains, etc, things young, idealistic college students care about. And thats perfectly fine. I just wish they would put the same effort into making the food edible and worth the money theyre asking for it. Users/JoeThePlumber

20110213 22:57:40 nbsp I am sad to say that the food here was better and cheaper before the major remodeling of 2010 :(

that said the tx mex nachos are still worth it if you must eat on campus (and it is way better than supporting chain restaurants at the Silo Users/tneeley

20110529 02:06:03 nbsp Food is bland and overpriced for the portions. Maybe Im just a big eater or Im too accustomed to the stereotypical ginormous portions that America is so wellknown for, but a Cooks large just doesnt seem to warrant four something dollars. And as a previous reviewer noted, they tend to go heavy on the rice. Im surprised that people pay for the CoHos swirl of chicken broth that it audaciously parades around as pho and thinks justifies a nearly $6 price tag. IMO, youd be better off bringing a packet of $0.25 ramen and heating that up with the free hot water offered by the bakery. Microwave some cooked chicken and throw in some easily transportable vegetables like spinach and you wouldnt be too far off from recreating the CoHos pho. I do acknowledge that the CoHo is the only viable eatery for those starved for time, but this does not justify the mediocre stuff that the CoHo pushes out and the accompanying steep prices.

The only bright spot would be the bakery which usually serves up delicious pastries (Im in love with the vegan rice krispies which they seem to never have!). I would, however, forgo the espresso items, for my experience has not convinced me of hope existening in that nook of the bakery.  Users/blastoff

20110708 23:25:34 nbsp Swirlz Bakery: Vegan Fudge Brownie: vegan brownie with chocolate frosting and candied coconut shavings 4/5  sometimes tastes stale

Caio Pizza: cheese pizza 3/5  the crust is fluffy but flavorless, same goes for the marinara sauce. They always put lots of cheese.

Choptstixx: vegetarian pho 2/5  flavorless broth with cardboard tofu and vegetables werent properly cut/sliced or even cooked

tex mex grill: chicken salad bowl 3/5  they were heavy on the romaine lettuce but skimped on the grilled chicken. pass on the chipotle sauce (its just slightly spicy mayo)

Fickle picle deli: jalapeno bagel with hummus 4/5  the bagel tastes good (not as good as noahs) they put way too much hummus in there and it spills everywhere when you bite into it

whole wheat bagel with fowl salad 3/5  the fowl salad wasnt particulary flavorful and the chicken was a bit stringy. the w.w. bagel was ok.

Cooks: Jamaican Black bean soup 2/5  tasted like bland black bean porridge until I added tapatio sauce which completely transformed it in a good way
meat lasagana 4/5: excellent taste but the cheese on top is crusty
tofu chili 4/5: pretty good but the tofu needs to absorb the flavor of the chili more
turky chili 4.5/5: tasted slightly better than the tofu chili
cashew pesto lasagna 5/5: best thing Ive had at cooks.  Excellent use of cashews for that nutty flavor. Might be a little too oily for some (but on the bright side its not bacon grease or anything its just olive oil)
 Users/rootmeansquare

20110801 11:40:47 nbsp The food was WAY better before the remodel, and cheaper. Everything Ive tried from the new coho has been mediocre at best, besides the bakery which is still good.   Users/JanaShute

20110801 18:35:19 nbsp I wasnt around before the remodel, but I agree that prices are rather steep.

TxMx has some good deals though. The Especial burritos are HUGE and include tortilla chips for $3.25 (if you get a black bean burrito, no rice). My favorite thing to get lately is the black bean especial taco salad. Romaine lettuce, black beans, guac, sour cream, choice of dressing (I get chipotle something or other), choice of salsa (I get pico), cheese, and crushed chips on top. NOM. Sometimes they forget to put cheese on so make sure you ask. That comes to $3.55 which is more than I would like to spend on lunch but beats almost all other Coho prices  especially the pricey salads at Croutons.

I also really like getting the $1 cone of frozen yogurt.

My wishful thinking: Ciao should withhold mushrooms from the vegetable pizza once in a while, and Swirlz should bake more savory items instead of just sugary treats. Also, bring back the pasta bar! Users/MeggoWaffle

20110923 15:28:13 nbsp Service at the CoHo is as friendly as ever. Student employees have always been cheerful and amiable, and you definitely get service with a smile.

The desserts at the CoHo are still delicious Im always a little sad when they dont have the cheesecake bars, but their sugar cookies are delicious (lighter in flavor, not overpowering so you get sick of it after the first bite). As for actual entrees, Ive only really had the pizza with any regularity, but Ive always found a slice of it to be reasonably priced and tasty, though not mindblowing.

My recent experience with the pho has led me back to the same conclusion from two years ago: its still extremely overpriced and...weird. The chicken broth is simultaneously sweet and savory, though not in a good way. The noodles often feel undercooked and overall the portions are simply underwhelming at $6 a pop. Im one of those people that enjoys their noodles swimming in broth in a giant bowl, and the CoHo pho felt like I was eating a serving of Cup Noodles.

Ive grown to accept the fact that the CoHo is a major convenience, but not a good place to get cheap food, or delicious food. There are some gems (the bakery), but there are things that fall pretty flat (the pho). If you have the time and/or means of transportation, you can find much better food downtown. Users/AbbYu

20131020 13:33:46 nbsp Its pretty common to see half the employees standing around and the other half working at half speed, even when there is a line ten deep.  Get you act together, younguns. Users/ScottB
