Cohousing, sometimes referred to as cooperative housing, has been prevalent for many years in Europe, and it started in Scandinavia. It is a recent phenomena here in the United States. Cohousing communities are resident developed neighborhoods which combine private homes with a shared community environment component, such as a community house, play areas, etc. Cohousing communities are planned and managed by residents. Typically, residents own the land in front of, under, and in back of their houses and share ownership of the common outdoor space and facilities.  A standard configuration is a cluster of private homes with a large shared backyard space forming a parklike area in the center. Sharing may involve a variety of responsibilities, tasks, equipment, and pleasures such as community meals.  Residents share in the maintenance of common property. Every household may also be expected to pay monthly dues to cover the cost of shared facilities and activities.

The proposed Covell Village development was slated to include a new cohousing community.  This was expected to be a 3035 townhome community with potential common facilities include dining, shared childrens play rooms, sitting room, workshop, guest rooms, laundry, and hot tub. Preliminary price estimates of a privately owned townhouse with a share of the common facilities ranged from $250,000 to $550,000.
