Colby may just be the most talented person in Davis, not in the sense of having the most talent but rather having the most talents. He is in a Well Known Secret band, as he knows how to play the guitar, the mandolin, the harmonica. He has been known to juggle, bowl, and play footbag. He is also an Alpha Gamma Omega alumnus and a knight of the Order of Telperion. Once, he taught himself conversational Italian in 3 months. He may or may not have the ability to fly. 

He can also recite the first one hundred digits of pie. What is WRONG WITH THIS GUY!?!

His current goals include becoming filthy rich just so he can give it all away and do it all again in an unrelated field, just because he can.
