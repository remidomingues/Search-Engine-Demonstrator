Located between Pure Beauty and Strings Italian Cafe in the The Marketplace Marketplace, Cold Stone Creamery is possibly the best Ice Cream ice cream shop in town. Their ice cream is made fresh daily. They custom make ice cream, shakes, smoothies, and cakes.  If you tip for any amount, even as small as a penny, all of the employees sing a fun thank you song.  Its fun!  If you know someone who works there, its even more fun.

The price of the ice cream is average compared to other super premium ice creams, and the portions are large. A small size with one mix in costs $3.19, a medium love it is $3.49, and a large Gotta have it is $3.99.  If youre a student at UCD, you can get 10% off ice cream by flashing your Reg card.  The cakes are a bit more but worth it!  The cake is soft and moist unlike most other ice cream cake.  Look for coupons...they are always available. They always have a full display of cakes ready for pick up anytime, or you can call and have one custom made.  They can usually have your custom cake done within a day.  Sometimes the same day, but always within a day.

Use the Super Saver Card and get a free Kids Creation Size with purchase of any like it or larger size ice cream OR $3 off any Cold Stone cake. They have a birthday club good for a free creation register on their website.  Look for the Market Place coupon book, they always have a coupon in it.

Cold Stone does fundraisers: check them out at http://www.coldstonecreamery.com.  The fundraisers are fun and easy.  They also do field trips for the elementary schools, child care centers, ets.  They do birthday parties, office parties, catering for 10 to 1000, special events, and more.  If it has to do with Ice cream or cake, Cold Stone can make it happen, so check them out for your next event.

They sponsor UCD athletics, so you may want to patronize them to show support for the Aggie team of your choice.  Check them out at the Aggie home games: they will be having contests, and giving away prizes.  Watch for the next contest where contestants will create a Cold Stone Song, and dance... the winner will get Free Ice Cream for an entire year and the winner gets a creation named after them.  There will also be ice cream eating contests and more.

 History 

Cold Stone originally opened May 9th, 2005 in Davis.  During the January 5th 2008 storm power outage they closed and did not reopen.  In June of that year, signs appeared that they were hiring, and on July 8th, they reopened under new ownership.




  Gotta love ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!

20080725 09:27:13 nbsp I went in to check out the new Cold Stone and was given the ol upsell:  Oh, you like chocolate?  You should try the quadruple chocolate with extra chocolate.  And you like peanut butter?  Try our superpeanut buttery delight with extra peanutty goodness!  Your taste buds will be so swamped you wont noticed how many more mixins that you had to pay for!   Users/CovertProfessor, hoping that this is not regular store practice.

20080729 01:55:40 nbsp Oh I think it is regular store practice amongst several stores (at least throughout Sacramento). Almost every location I have visited has been like that but worse if its possible. In all actuality the employees are usually snobby, rude, incompetent, or just plain annoying. The ice cream itself is average in taste but so many people love it anyway. Users/csmith

20090127 05:34:40 nbsp I cant speak for the new Davis management, but the old management and the stores Ive frequented in Vacaville and Irvine always have fine customer service. . .then again I have a specific order (and I usually get a pint) so maybe they dont bother to upsell me. Users/KellyCorcoran

20090401 09:04:15 nbsp the ladies working there ( havent been any men as of yet) have always been very pleasant and accommodating. Since I dont like chocolate chips in my selection theyve always asked if I want to swap it out. They smile and are polite. Users/patrick82

20090504 16:47:14 nbsp The customer service was good last time I was here. Pretty much the same stuffs with other Cold Stones Ive been to. Users/thtly

20090523 01:54:21 nbsp I got  A Cheesecake Named Desire It was the absolute most delicious thing on earth. A cake for 20 dollars really can feed 8 people, and feed as in make full. the cakes are tall, dont be fooled by the small circumference. It can easily feed more if you want people to just get a taste of cake. Users/chand3123k

20100307 00:11:13 nbsp i was an old employee of coldstone creamry and i am so pissed to see that people think o no poor family who owned cold stone couldnt get back on their feet after the power outage! First the family are such asses. The power outage was never the reason they closed. They were doing horribly. I know i worked there. I had a feeling that they were closing but stacy roe, the owner, would just say when they were packing up all the cold stone thing, we are just moving out all the 2008 things to make room for the 2009 stuff! She was planning on closing down. Thankfully i am not stupid, and i started looking for a job. Then during that storm, where yes the power went out, i went in to get my check, and wouldnt you know it stacy and her friends were ripping down the store. She said ok so i kept it a secret, we are closing. WOW she really only gives a crap about herself, not her college student employees who think they have ajob, and dont. Then she handed me $40 and told me that was for working the last 2 weeks! OK STACY you are about $200 short!!! i was to shocked to say anything, but i should have sued her. I hope these people never own another business agian! They are horrible! All stacy would do is come in and complain that she is overwheight. Well ya you eat icecream all day, no joke. I have to say thank god they went under cause i have nightmares about working there! Users/poed
