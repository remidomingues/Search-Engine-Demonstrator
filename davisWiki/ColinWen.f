Here is a good poems:

My voice will speak
despite all hostilities
no fear
in my eyes
knowing this fight
is for life
for those who cant
speak for themselves
marginalized
pushed aside
silenced
in the darkened womb
a forgotten generation cries
and they will be heard
their voices will perpetuate
through my life
because I cannot forget
I cannot lie
this is murder
these babies die.

Ode to the Sweet Pen

Oh how dearly I love thee
and your beautiful strokes
the way you touch down
it sure aint a joke.

Those dark smooth lines
drive me crazy inside
and the results are amazing
something I just cant hide

Ode to the sweet pen
and all that you do
so sad that I could have fallen
for a pen like you.


20050427 18:37:15 nbsp Do you have any suggestions for resources for women with unplanned pregnancies who choose to keep their babies and/or for young/single/student/otherwise marginalized parents? Im working on Davis parenting resources, and I and others have found that this information is hard to find. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20050519 23:44:00 nbsp If you go to the Planned parenthood federation of America annual report from 2003, they performed 244,628 abortions procedures out of 7,961,514 total medical procedures. That is a little over 3%. The are statistics that are audited by the government. Users/JimSchwab

20050520 00:17:07 nbsp Yeah, I just looked at the report. Yes, Planned Parenthood provides many other services besides abortion. But solely in comparison to prenatal services, abortions dominate. And the report does not detail anything on counseling or postnatal care as for as I know. Users/ColinWen

Hi Colin, I believe at one point you stated remember, the catholic church is infallible, or something akin to that.  I thought you might like to take a look at this article on the secular web: http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID398. Remember, as an organization made up by humans, they are fallible and are made only more ethically dangerous when its members do not realize that fact and believe they are standing on a solid rock of absolutism, rather than a sandy beach that changes with the tides of time. Users/KarlMogel P.S. My full response will be done in about a month  as I am concentrating my efforts on building my new website  and both will make their debut together.

20051207 22:19:15 nbsp By normal usage, I mean the normal method by which that hormone contraceptives work.  They do cause any fertilized eggs to be aborted, but the vast majority of eggs arent fertilized due to the hormones  thus, the normal mechanism is not abortive.  IUDs are 100% abortive, while barriers (condoms) and the morning after pill are not abortive, but as a result do have a failure rate higher than hormonal contraceptives.  Hormonal treatments can cause abortions, but the normal mechanism by which they work prevent a need for any abortions  eggs that slip through are, however, aborted.  I have no problem with you writing that, as it is an important consideration for anybody considering birth control options who has a moral objection to abortion.  To characterize hormonal contraceptives as causing abortions is, however, misleading, as it implies that the normal contraceptive mechanism is abortive.  It is not.   As I not earlier, IUDs are abortive and should be completely avoided by anybody seeking a nonabortive contraceptive.  Hormone treatments are likely to be safe, although the statistical possibility of an abortion occurring during their use is certainly a consideration that will likely rule them out.  Barriers and morning after pills would be completely safe for them.   Users/JabberWokky

20051209 23:02:27 nbsp That page is wrong and/or outdated.  Earlier this year it was confirmed that no uterine wall shedding occurs.  It was only ever a theoretical possibility, and has now been shown not to occur (ref: http://www.popcouncil.org/publications/popbriefs/pb11(2)_3.html study).  With the morning after pill, if youre pregnant, youre pregnant.  All it does is block pregancy if it has not yet occured. Users/JabberWokky

20051209 23:12:02 nbsp As for listing contraceptive hormone treatements as causing abortions, you should be aware that many medications can also cause abortions as a side effect, such as Misoprostol, an ulcer and heartburn medication.  A common way to prevent these drugs from causing abortions in patients with moral objections is to prescribe hormonal contraceptives, since they usually prevent contraception.  On the rare occasion that they dont prevent contraception, they do cause abortions, but that is not their normal use  it is a side effect, just as it is a side effect of the ulcer medication and not how it normally works or is normally used. Users/JabberWokky

20051213 19:35:15 nbsp I doubt it was confirmed. That study was done by a quite liberal group. In fact they help fund the American Society of Emergency Contraception. All Planned Parenthood and other proabortion websites all list the same fact. That the EC pill does thin the uterine wall. This is a website I found on some of the studies http://www.polycarp.org/postfertilization_polycarp_1.htm All medicines have their side effects listed with them. That was merely what I was doing by mentioning that birth control can cause abortions. Because it can.  Users/ColinWen
