Collective provides both tutoring academic and social support to empower transfer, reentry, parent, and all nontraditional students to succeed in higher education. Collective offers all students a safe and welcoming environment to further engage students in their educational pursuits. Furthermore, Collective offers campus visits to expose disadvantaged students to provide insight into the opportunities available through higher education.



Collective aims to recruit and retain all nontraditional students by providing services such as:

Transfer Outreach: Collective supports prospective transfer students through community college outreach.  A goal of transfer outreach is to interest economically and educationally disadvantaged students in continuing their postsecondary education. Resources offered are presentations, shadow days and transfer weekend at UC Davis.

Retention: Collective facilitates the retention of transfer, reentry, parent, and all nontraditional UC Davis students by hosting weekly transfer hours, workshops, community mixers and other events.  At these events, students can meet new people, learn about resources on campus and increase their sense of community. Under the T.E.A.M. Mentorship Program, new transfer students are paired with second year transfer students based on their major and interests to build a sense of community and support.

Campus Visits: Collective offers a collegegoing experience around the UC Davis campus to prospective students of all educational levels (K12 & Community College). Campus Visits is a great way that many current UC Davis students can get involved and share their unique college experiences, which will hopefully have a positive influence on visiting students and guests.
