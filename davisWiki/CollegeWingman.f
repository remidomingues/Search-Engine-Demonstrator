CollegeWingman is a Locally Owned Websites locally owned website for college students that allows people to review local restaurants, bars, and clubs. Establishments that are especially well reviewed are given the label of wiki:wiktionary:dank, accompanied by a graphic of a hamburger with a marijuana leaf in it. The site currently caters exclusively to students at UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, and UCLA.

The site was created by http://www.synaptixdevelopment.com/ Synaptix Development, a design firm out of New Zealand, for their clients Vandendriesse and Glanzman, UCD undergraduate students undergraduates and brothers of Sigma Chi. The site runs a modified version of http://n2cms.com/ N2CMS.


20090222 14:16:27 nbsp The site seems to run rather slowly, crashes pretty often, and I have trouble taking any site seriously that lumps Pizza Guys and Sudwerk into the same price range. Also, since Im not a stoner, the dank label sounds alternately juvenile or reminiscent of a littleused basement. Ill take the wiki over this site any day of the week! Users/JoePomidor

20090222 15:05:40 nbsp Dank sounds rather dark and moldy to me.  Probably not what I look for in a restaurant... Users/IDoNotExist

20090222 15:28:18 nbsp http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dank?r75 Dank defined Users/CovertProfessor

20090222 16:09:22 nbsp Yes, I thought dank meant badly reviewed restaurants and so did not bother looking at them. Users/EricaMacGregor

20090222 18:15:27 nbsp Yes...all that slang is rather silly. Fortunately the site is made for students, presumably between the ages of 18 and 24.  Users/AndrewBianchi

20090222 18:52:10 nbsp Yeah, the slang apparently is not dank.  ;) Users/IDoNotExist

20090224 21:31:36 nbsp So the site seemed to be running pretty fast when I checked...and thats saying something because I was pretty blazed. Looks like they know their audience ;) Found that latenight munchies spot I was looking for. Dank! Users/Grindin1ncagain

20090224 21:51:59 nbsp It looks to me like they grabbed at least the photo for Taqueria Davis from this very wiki. http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id630 Compare for yourself. Users/JasonAller

20090224 21:54:08 nbsp This site is pretty much Urbanspoon with a stoner motif and a difficult to use interface. There wasnt much information about any restaurants, the pages where cluttered, poorly  organized and overrun with adverts, and even with the above link I have no idea why i would want to go to a dank place. I cant see this taking off with the wiki providing pretty much the same service much much much better.  Users/AndrewPeake

20090224 21:54:16 nbsp I would concur with Jason Aller, it would appear we got ganked Users/StevenDaubert

20090224 23:00:33 nbsp Caffe Italia was http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1056 stolen as well, along with Sophias Thai Kitchen http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1279 link, Lamppost Pizza http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1169 link, Sams Mediterranean http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id622 link, Thai Recipes http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1295 link,Bakers Square http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1048 link, 21 and Seven http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id2501 link, Aioli Bodega Espanola http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1046 link, Tucos http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1311 link, Symposium http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1946 link, Farmers Kitchen Cafe http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1078 link, Cafe Mediterranee http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id810 link, Red Orchid Restaurant http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1271 link, 3rd & U Cafe http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id4612 link, Froggys http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1755 link, and they appear to have stolen http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1258 this image directly off the Davis Airporter http://www.davisairporter.com/rates.html website, and http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1956 this image off of the Konditorei http://www.konditoreidavis.com/services.htm website.

  True, but then again its definitely illegal when http://www.collegewingman.com/viewlisting.aspx?id1191 they steal an image from an http://osteriafasulo.com/_wsn/page7.html establishments own webpage, such as from Osteria Fasulo. Users/JoePomidor

20090225 17:19:53 nbsp Id like to address all of the legitimate issues that people have brought up. We are not trying to hide the fact that our users have uploaded images from DavisWiki. CollegeWingman is by no means trying to infringe upon DavisWiki or any of their affiliates. As we are a new site, we have not gotten a chance to work out all of the kinks. Therefore we would appreciate it if you cut us a little slack. At this point we can do one of two things: 1. Delete every image that our users took from DavisWiki or 2. Give credit to DavisWiki somewhere in our site (where would you like us to put this)

Any other concerns can be brought up with either myself or Peter. Thanks for the feedback.
Alain Users/acglanzman
  So are you asking the Daviswiki community what to do?  If so, I say delete them all if youre not willing to place an attribution on each one.

20090225 17:38:43 nbsp Like I said before...we have no problem crediting the Daviswiki Community. We are adding the attributions right now. Please let us know which other pictures came from Daviswiki and well make note of it on our site. We have no way of knowing where our users take their photos from so we apologize if our website caused you any offense. Users/acglanzman

   From my quick look at the site, all of the images came from either the Davis Wiki or were lifted directly from the businesses websites.  You guys didnt add these images yourselves or pay people to?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20090225 18:19:56 nbsp Not sure I understand your question Philip. The majority of the pictures on CollegeWingman were taken by our photographer.  Users/acglanzman

20090225 18:54:14 nbsp So the attributions to DavisWiki have now been added to CollegeWingman. From here on out any questions or concerns can be brought to our attention by using the (Contact Us) function on our website. Thanks again for your feedback.  Users/acglanzman

20090225 19:35:13 nbsp Dont rush off.  It looks like your Terms & Agreements page http://www.collegewingman.com/termsagreement.aspx was lifted wordforword from the naabt.org website http://www.naabt.org/terms.cfm Users/JimStewart
 If they have to rip off a T&C, they should at least rip off one that was competently written. An essential element of a contract is acceptance. If all parties do not accept the contract, no contract exists. A visitor is not informed of the agreement before they use the site, thus there is no acceptance. Even putting that issue aside, the amendment provisions suffer from the same problems. You cannot unilaterally change the terms of a contract without notification. The other party must be notified of changes in some way and they must accept them.
 Another laughable provision is the prohibition of using anything on the site in litigation or arbitration. Such a provision would be found unconscionable because it interferes with due process rights. Come on, really? Also, the linking provisions are bogus. Linking does not necessarily constitute use of the site, so you cant bind people under an agreement that only covers use. wl
  Actually, they put a link to the site over here at Davis Wiki, which means that we can create derivative works under the Creative CommonsBy License. :)  Users/BrentLaabs
