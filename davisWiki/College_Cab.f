20110125 16:47:08 nbsp I used College Cab throughout Fall quarter last year for rides to and from Amtrak since I was commuting from the Bay Area and had my threeyearold with me and they were great. Always on time and very reasonable with rates (I made an arrangement with them since I needed a ride twice or thrice a week). Michael and Yelena are super friendly and very reliable.  Users/ZehraR

20110323 22:00:59 nbsp College Cab is AMAZING!!!! I reserved to have them pick me up at the Amtrak station and they asked me to call them when I was in Sacramento so they could track me and make sure I did not have to wait out in the cold. I unfortunately forgot my phone back home and pretty much had no way of calling them when I was in Sacramento. When I got to Davis, I was afraid that they would not show up because I never called, but the Driver called the Amtrak station to see if the bus I was on came in and hurried on over to see if I was there! I am so glad that I reserved with College Cab! The driver was so sweet and Ill definitely do business with them again! Users/LivYaj

20110906 11:51:56 nbsp I use College Cab to get to and from the airport a couple of times a month.   I schedule pickups in advance and they are ALWAYS on time (and usually a few minutes early).    I really appreciate knowing that I can count on them to be there when I arrive at the airport or when I need to catch a flight.  As a bonus, Michael and Yelena are really friendly, great people and totally reliable.  I cant recommend them highly enough.  If you need a ride in Davis or to the airport should definitely call them.  Youll be happy you did. Users/dkco
