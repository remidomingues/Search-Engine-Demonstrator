If you still have clothes that were being cleaned here, pick them up at  Courtesy Cleaners College Courtesy Cleaners.




College Cleaners provides drycleaning, professional wet cleaning, pressing, tailoring, and alterations. This business is part of a family of cleaners including Courtesy Cleaners College Courtesy Cleaners on East Covell Boulevard as well as three cleaners in Woodland. One person seemed to recall a claim that items dropped off in the morning will be ready by the following evening. This can be very important to those who procrastinate until the very very last minute before getting their suits drycleaned.

20060811 14:25:52 nbsp I took a bridesmaid dress there to be altered. They did it quickly, for $25. I was very happy. Users/MaryFord

20070104 09:26:39 nbsp I brought a pair of slacks and two shirts there on a Tuesday to be drycleaned.  They told me that I would have them by Friday but they didnt finish in time.  I was forced to go to a work conference without my suit.  Im more interested in finding a 24 hour service now. Users/ZakDavis

20080529 16:45:06 nbsp I had a pair of slacks and my favorite shirt dry cleaned and pressed.  Twelve bucks, on time, and nice people working the counter.  Id come back. Users/JamesShearer

20090123 01:29:08 nbsp I send my gfs dress there on Dec 28, 2008. I was told that it will be done on January 2, 2009. I went back few times and they said it has not been sent back. Finally got it back on January 22, 2009. IT WAS DESTROYED. The lady refused to compensate our lose and just said it was not their fault (she blamed the manufacture, but I asked the lady if that material is okay for drycleaning and she said yes). I dont think there is any nice people working there. They totally sucked. Users/Gregx

20090126 09:36:42 nbsp They also destroyed my dresses! I guess they put your clothes into a blender instead of dry cleaning machine. They said its not their fault, too. Users/HonorH

20090224 18:11:18 nbsp My dress was destroyed and they still do not even try to resolve the issue. It has been two months. There is no real manager so you cannot solve the problem by talking to the manager. How could this happen? Users/HonorH

20090310 18:06:07 nbsp VERY unhappy, I wont be back.

I could deal with the additional expense for green clean but I wont deal with the ridiculously rude counter girl.  Also, I work in Sacramento and make an effort to get there 1015 minutes before closing time.  I understand it can be a pain for cleanup or whatever, but Im always very quick, in and out within 3 minutes.  However, the last several times I went to drop off or pick up items they were closed 1015 minutes early.  Both times the girl was still in there, looked up when I tried the door and then waved me away.  After the first time I thought maybe it was later than I realized, after the second time I complained.  The third time I actually called ahead of time to make sure they would be open but by the time I got down there...she just stared at me through the glass and flicked me away. Users/KristinaT

20090423 11:55:17 nbsp DONT TAKE YOUR CLOTHES TO THIS CLEARNER.  BAD SERVICE & UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE

Im extremely unhappy about this place.  I took my coat there a few weeks ago and it came back with one missing button.  The owner said that she would fix it in a few days.  I thought she would send it to alteration.  When I went back a few days later, heres what she said to me: Oh, I have a needle but I cant do anything about it because theres no button.  Do you want to send it to alteration?  You have to pay for it though.  Why do I have to pay for the loss?  Then I asked if I still had to pay the whole cost of the drycleaning, she replied,  Yes.  Youre done.  Youre all done.  Unbelievable.  Ill never be back.     Users/YayoiW

20090820 13:08:00 nbsp I had a great experience at this place.  I brought in a dress than I had dropped salad dressing on (big greasy stains) and the lady behind the counter was honest with me.  She told me that it would take a couple of days since it had to be sent out and that there was a reasonable chance that the stain wasnt going to come out.  She took notes on what the stain was and what I had pretreated it with and gave me a quote for how much it was going to cost.  When I picked it up on the day she told me to come back, it was ready, the spots were gone and she charged me exactly what she said she would.  I think if you come in with a smile and be polite, it will go a long way at this place. Users/MicheleTobias

20091110 18:09:49 nbsp Took in a Halloween costume to have the zipper changed.  Ready in one week, cost only $8.50 (I wonder if the zipper was less broken than I thought).  But overall, it was a good experience, they also cleaned and pressed my costume. Users/BamCam
