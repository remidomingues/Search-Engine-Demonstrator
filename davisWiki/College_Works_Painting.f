20100201 23:57:32 nbsp As I understand it, College Works hires students all around the country, trains them, and gives them the tools to run their own minibusinesses as a sort of twist on a franchise system.  Its typically a summer job.  The concept always struck me as kind of shady, but my parents had their house in Livermore painted by a CW group (managed by a UCD student!) and had great results.  Im sure its been at least 10 years now, and as far as I know there have been no complaints with the paint.  That said, theres probably a lot of variance from one manager to the next.

20100403 11:42:11 nbsp I just called both numbers.  One is disconnected and the other does not belong to College Works Painting. Users/PatLenzi1

20100403 16:26:25 nbsp Theres another phone number on the website linked above.  It may be a national thing, though, rather than the local branch(es).  You could check with them to see whats available in the area. Users/TomGarberson

20101101 20:26:29 nbsp Ive heard notgood things about College Works, specifically about working for College Works.  I Googled it and found this: http://forums.redflagdeals.com/studentworkspaintinghiringpainters541187/2/    so be careful if youre considering working for them. Users/BrianSparks

20110125 14:47:18 nbsp These guys are total crooks. I saw notices all over UC Davis campus today. They violate numerous California labor laws and keep interns on board with promises of pay without ever actually paying them. Theyve been banned from marketing on campus and students are supposed to notify the campus police if approached by them.  Users/Doogle

20110224 16:54:03 nbsp The numbers that I have edited were for an intern and his helper who were part of the program during one summer. I tried contacting them and have been told that they no longer work with the program. I would suggest looking into the information updated above if interested in their services or searching online if interested in the credibility of the program. Users/aviDavis

20110224 18:50:00 nbsp If you provide a phone number, once again YOU NEED TO INCLUDE RELEVANT LICENSES OF LIC CONTRACTORS OR CSLB WILL COME INTO PLAY!

Aggie did an interesting article on College works as of late... Users/StevenDaubert

20110225 13:44:54 nbsp Information was taken from their website since erasing the info entirely was not acceptable. Now edited for Licensing info. Please note that I do not work for CWP nor am I advocating or denouncing them. The edits were made to help others as the information was incorrect. Also, while I did update the license number, please note that there were only 2 DavisWIKI entries found via http://daviswiki.org/Home_Improvement_%26_Repair for Painting that included a License number and that a simple search would have allowed one to locate the CSLB Information.
