The College of Engineering offers rigorous majors for students to major in. Expect a course load of about 180 units for any engineering major (compared to half, or even less than half, required for some liberal arts majors). Hence, some people would consider any student pursuing an engineering major to be destined for at least 4 years of hard work with little to no social life outside of geeky classmates. Of course, if theyre willing to dedicate 4+ years of their lives to it, it cant be all that bad.  Besides, the result of attaining an engineering degree can often lead to a nice, high paying job.

UC Davis has twelve wiki:wikipedia:ABET accredited engineering programs, more than any other UC campus. A bachelor engineering degree from an ABET accredited program is necessary to sit for the wiki:wikipedia:Engineer In Training EIT exam in the state of California, a prerequisite for a professional engineering license. Some programs arent ABET accredited just yet, but thats probably being worked on.

Interesting Fact: The CoE became independent from Berkeley in 1962.

Changing Majors

UC Davis College of Engineering is well known for its openness towards students who wish to pursue engineering. Unlike other UC campuses, which have strict rules in place to prevent students from changing majors, Davis guarantees students a spot in engineering. However, this guarantee is contingent on the completion of several prerequisite courses and a minimum GPA. The official requirements are posted at http://engineering.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/advising/answers.html#a1. Once you meet those requirements, its a simple matter of filling out your Change of Major form, turning it into 1050 Kemper Hall and waiting for the official confirmation from the Dean of Engineering (usually takes around 23 days).
