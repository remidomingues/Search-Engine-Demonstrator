You See Davis Days

Our largest event is a 3day conference, held ThursdaySaturday before Picnic Day for approximately 20 high school students, during which the delegates stay at our homes and get a taste of life here at UC Davis. This includes pizza parties, auditing the occasional lecture, financial aid/college admissions workshops, and of course the indispensable campus tour. We also work with Kaplan Educational Center Kaplan to provide a lowcost practice SAT workshop to high school 4H members.
