20100722 19:26:16 nbsp I first went to Leslie at Style lounge in December 09. I brought a picture of what I wanted and she did a GREAT job. I LOVED it (and Im really picky about color jobs). This time around, I had a coupon for Style Lounge and due to the great reviews for Jerry (although people had said that he was really hit or miss), I decided I would try it just this one time. I brought him a picture of what I wanted, and overall he did an okay job, except that he gave me a good 3 shades lighter than what I wanted. I have black hair, and it was straight up bleachedcolored blonde. He told me that I just had to get use to it but if i changed my mind (which he didnt think I would do), I could go back for another treatment of toner. After a week, I still didnt like my unnaturallooking highlights. I scheduled an appointment with Leslie so she could look at my hair, and she said she would fix my hair I would just have to pay for the toner $15 (what a deal!). I was also pleasantly surprised to see that she keeps records of everyone who she styles, so she knew exactly what she did to my hair last time! I came back a few days later and needless to say, my hair looks AMAZING. I will NEVER go to another stylist again. Leslie is seriously amazing!!!  Users/StephanieNg

20101026 15:31:55 nbsp Brazilian Blowout, but better!!
I have really thick hair. And when my hair is in its dry, natural state, it looks quite odd and unattractive. (very poofy and curly) I have had it thinned, and layered through out the years, but I had never really liked how it looked. So at the age of 13, I Invested in a flat iron, and learned to use it religiously.  I love to have long hair but the longer it was, the longer it took me to get ready in the morning. I would have to wake up 2 to 3 hours earlier just to get a decent look going. I had heard of chemical straightening treatments before, but I was always nervous that I would damage my hair even further than what it went through in my teenage years (blonde to black, to brown, to black with blue color shots, to black, and then a damaging all over blonde treatment). Then Leslie told me about this Brazilian Keratin Blowout and how it is like the Brazilian Blowout but without the Formaldehyde and other harmful chemicals.
I had it done about a week ago, and I cannot believe how soft my hair still is. I barely have to straighten it after I blow dry it. Leslie is so nice and was able to squeeze me in that day. I was amazed by how quick she was able to do it and how professional she is. She gave me all the information I need to take care of my hair and explained that the better I take care of it, the longer the treatment will last ( up to 36 MONTHS!!!) She even told me what to look out for in shampoos and conditioners to help keep my color! I have spent a LOT of money on my hair in the past and I feel that $250 is a very reasonable price for this treatment and the wonders it did!
I will never go to another stylist again!! LESLIE IS THE BEST!!! Users/BrittBanner

20110303 15:09:41 nbsp Leslie is great!  She bleached my roots and they turned out the same color as the rest of my hair which is very important for a platinum blonde.  She accomplished this in half the time it takes most other stylists to complete.  I was wary about letting someone other than my usual stylist bleach my hair but my regular stylist is located in a different state and I needed my roots done now but I was extremely pleased with my results.  She was very friendly and knowledgable about hair and the bleaching process.  The price was very reasonable and the salon is very clean and wellkept.  I will definitely come back to Leslie in the future!     Users/LoriOrf
