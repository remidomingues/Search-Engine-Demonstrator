He uses some very sophisticated diagnostic technology along with a very caring and informative approach. He even helped me to improve my kayaking alignment. I was so impressed that I see him on a regular basis!  VenatiusPrasad

20081003 19:09:35 nbsp I have had recurring problems with my hip for over 10 years that have caused my entire posture to be out of whack.  I have been to many different types of doctors trying to get this problem fixed, but Dr. Colvin is the first one who has thoroughly evaluated my entire alignment and posture in an effort to actually fix the underlying problem.  He even used a really interesting body scanning computer program to get a detailed analysis of my posture.  Then, he used this information to assign exercises that I can do at home, plus he took an hour showing me how to do every one of them with proper form.  I am very excited that with Dr. Colvins help I will finally fix my hip problems.  Users/EJones
