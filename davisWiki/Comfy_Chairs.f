Whether sleeping, studying, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee, knowing the location of the closest comfy chair is very important for those who are into such things. List your favorites here.

Couches, loveseats, bean bags, and other wellpadded sitting/lying locations, though not Official Comfy Chairs, also qualify.

On Campus
 See Sleeping On Campus
  ARC has probably the nicest (and most expensive!) chairs on campus.
  UC Davis Bookstore
  Womens Resource and Research Center Womens Center Reading Room and Righteous Babe Lounge  a nice chair in the reading room and comfy couches in the lounge
  Segundo Dining Commons had three sets of double ottoman chairs (6 total). Usually there are small circular tables that you can move, next to the chairs. But, you can just relax and almost nap in the DC there. It is good if you go by yourself. Good birdseye view of the DC.

Around Davis
  Avid Reader (surrounding the chess table and upstairs in kids section)
  Borders (scattered around the store)
  Common Grounds
  Delta of Venus
  Mother & Baby Source (Intended for parents caring for babies. Probably wouldnt take too kindly to studiers)
  Old Teahouse
  University Mall Starbucks (Two big comfy purple sofas with nice lamp.)
  Regal Cinemas Davis Stadium 5 has pretty comfy stadium seating

Chairs Passed into Legend
  Cafe Roma has terrible chairs but nice couches/big armtype chairs.  Their sitting chairs (the ones next to the tables) are practically falling apart (050505) Holy Jesus, the green couch has to be the lumpiest thing ever (but it looks cool!) There was one incredibly comfortable gray recliner that lulled studiers to sleep. It is missed.
  Espresso Roma
  Java California

Mobile
  RoboChair
