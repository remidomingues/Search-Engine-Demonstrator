Comics can include web comics, print comics such as those in newspapers, comic books and manga.  While some believe comics are generally for children the medium has a long history of adult readers and material dating back to the early 20th century.  The moral scare leading into the 1950s culminated in the wiki:wikipedia:Comics Code Authority, which pushed comics to rather vanilla stories that tended to appeal to children.  Years later, reflecting a greater openness in society, underground comics like those from Robert Crumb R. Crumb (who lived over in Winters) became cultural markers for the hippies hippie and counterculture movement that was so highly visible in Northern California.  By the 1980s, comics were mined by Hollywood for the largest blockbuster films, with 1989s Batman setting boxoffice records.  That continues to today, with films for both families and adultthemed movies being inspired by the comic industry.

Davis used to be host to a departed businesses handful of comic book stores, but Bizarro World was the only remaining until Droms Comics and Cards opened in 2008.  More are available in greater wiki:sacramento:comics Sacramento, and of course a smaller selection of comic books and graphic novels are often available at other retailers, such as book stores.

The end zone was one of the more notably comic book stores as it actually had space for tourneys  Users/StevenDaubert

20100126 17:31:04 nbsp The End Zone is the only one I remember, and IIRC they were not really a comic shop, more of a card gaming and sport card shop.  They did have a ton of play space however, I ran several Legend of the 5 Rings tournaments there back in the day. Users/rfrazier
