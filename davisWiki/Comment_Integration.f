This is a Wiki Community page for Talk Pages discussing the process of Comment Integration.

For an example of comment integration in practice look at:
  http://daviswiki.org/Symposium?actiondiff&version2113&version1111 Symposium  an earlier integration
  http://daviswiki.org/Beach_Hut_Deli?actiondiff&version277&version176 Beach Hut Deli  March 2011

 Proposed Comment Integration Approach 
In hopes of getting a discussion on integration moving again, Id like to propose the following steps as a general starting point:
 1. Before removing comments, make sure each one is represented in the main entry.
   Things like recommendations, good service, bad service, and comparisons to other establishments can easily be summarized.
   Information that isnt already in the entry should be added (they offer X discount/special; they take/dont take reservations; hours changed; unique features; etc.)
   Detailed accounts and genuine reviews can be:
   1. Summarized (example: Han http://daviswiki.org/Bistro_33?actiondiff&version2635&version1634 summarized my experience with being accused of trying to rip off Bistro 33 when I complained about service)
   1. Copied in their entirety (possibly indented, italicized, etc.) and attributed
   1. Quoted in part and attributed (example: second paragraph of Jade Garden, quoting Jim Stewart)
   1. Whatever else you think appropriate!
 1. Archive the comments.
 1. Link to the archive, along with a note encouraging editors to add their viewpoint directly to the entry (e.g. Beach Hut Deli under the Comments macro).

Likes?  Dislikes?  Alternatives?  Trolls?  Obviously theres going to be a lot of variation based on the specifics; my hope is to work out an approach that people can generally agree upon and lay out a howto so that anyone whos interested can easily help out.  We could even do a collaboration project on integrating comments.



20091223 20:46:19 nbsp Its sad but in most comment situations on the wiki now, the authors are not engaged enough in the wiki editing collaboration (only comment occasionally, not much editing) to trust each other to summarize comments. I think the best we can do in such situations is when there is an especially nice or useful comment, move it more to the top of the page, and leave it in the original position. I also think people who arent as engaged are still very valuable to the wiki because of the additional perspective and exclusive information they bring. People who are paying more attention can help sort out good information and make it easier to find for other readers. Useful information floats to the top? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091223 21:38:01 nbsp Nick hits the nail on the head, I for one have always looked to put my comments in the article, but I find that people will pick then out and put them with the non integrated comments Users/StevenDaubert
 And I try to put them back when I see people do it. wl

20091224 07:10:06 nbsp I certainly understand the point of comment integration when it helps improve the article in question.  Ive never, however, understood the point to removing the original comment.  It would be better to offer an indented Ive integrated this comment in the comments section to show that it was integrated and resolved.  That shows history, shows that the wiki helps the world, etc.  Otherwise we end up with Real Computers cases where only the bad comments are integrated/resolved and the good ones are left by a business owner.  Why arent the good ones integrated?  Why only the bad?  Because comment integration allows rewording and thus becomes a tool of the business owner. Users/WesHardaker

    Last time (or several times back) this subject came up, I split the things that get typed into comment boxes into a few categories, something like three to five different types of things entered into the comment macro.  Reviews are reviews, information is different... and of course there is sometimes overlap, but its surprising how often they fall into a particular category (I think its the mindset of the person when they start typing).  Talking about comments is a bit simplistic, IMO (at least if theres to be a discussion about integrating them). jw

20091224 09:34:13 nbsp Another thing that often happens when opinions get integrated is that they end up getting watered down and useless because there is too much disagreement. Some say the coffee is divine, but others dont think so.  yawn  Whats the point?  Is there a way to integrate disagreement without it becoming empty?  And it seems to me that the cases where opinions fall in line are rare.  (But they do happen  as with the number of people who have commented on how nice the owner of Raja is). Im not asking a rhetorical question here... Id welcome some thoughts on this.  Users/CovertProfessor
   I dont think thats a function of integration, but rather a style of integration.  I took a shot at Symposium, but I also chose that based on the types of comments.  A more spicy entry should remain full of radical opinions when the comments are integrated.  The me toos may vanish in a general phrase, but a really strong viewpoint shouldnt ever be watered down; the goal of integration (in my mind) is to raise the visibility of vigorous commentary, not smooth them all over into a banal whole. jw
    I really like the way you contrasted positive and negative viewpoints with direct quotes and detailed summarysomething that could probably be done on Beach Hut Deli and Jade Garden to improve the integration.  I think taking snippets from a range of viewpoints would be a great way to do it. tg

20120703 23:49:25 nbsp I really do not understand if the University is for students than why we have a fine too much. I mean if someone park over the time limit just give him/her a ticket for a full day parking fee instead of full month parking permit. It seems like same corporate/business culture is controlling our lives here at the University and sucking our blood beside our money like leaches. When you go to buy a monthly permit the ladies are so slow and some time it looks like that we are in beauty contest and when they talk...ohhh my God, youll forget everything. I mean they are so rude, you cannot feel that those ladies are working at a Decent place (UC Davis), 1st bad image you get of this University through these ladies working at the TAPS office. They all should be moved out to some place that suits their personality but not the respectful institute. Recently there is new lady hired  doing really great and you forget all of your tiredness of  12 hours waiting in a line When she talks that help you to Understand that you are really in a University atmosphere that teaches us good manners and politeness. I have no idea how could she stuck among others????This department shows so much efficiency when giving a parking ticket but cannot see whatâ€™s going on in their own department. They are trying to fix others problems but forgot their own.?????  Try to avoid as much as possible and keep as much distance from this department is better for your daily life and routine work. This office is like blood pressure increasing department.  Users/ZeeKhan
