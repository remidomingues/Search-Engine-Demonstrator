Wanna say something about the page without necessarily adding any content to it?


ADD A COMMENT BOX!

Gimme a {{{Comments}}}. Whalahh, youre ready to comment.

You can also chose an alternative text by doing this: {{{Comments(Hey dude, leave a comment!)}}}.

Note:  Make sure its at the very bottom of the page, because when you enter text into the comment box it will simply append it to the very bottom of the page.  Its exactly the same as making a usual edit of the page, except the time and your user name will be appended for you.  How awesome is that!  Comments are limited to 1000 characters, so if you have something long to write it may be better to edit the page directly.

 When to use a comments box 

I think comments boxes work well on pages where the comments arent likely to be integrated into the normal page content. Experiences/personal opinion is good for comments.  I think comment boxes are harmful when people use them to actually contribute to a page.  Then youre left with a mess of a page that __always__ has to be refactored.  A good rule might be:  if youre finding yourself replying back and forth using a comment box then its probably best to edit the page usually.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

My guideline is that manual editing is generally preferable.  The only exception is for polls and polllike content, such as restaurant reviews.  In these cases, the comment box is acceptable, although I personally still prefer to do without.

My problem with the comment box is that it encourages people to use the wiki in a streamofconsciousness way.  This leads to it being lessuseful to the reader.  It also works to discourage editing  people often simply leave comments, without ever using the more advanced editing capabilities.  Its not even particularly good for discussion, as it doesnt support any sort of threading.  Conversations quickly become tangled. ct

I pretty much agree with Philips thoughts on when comment boxes are good.  Here are the primary benefits I see to comment boxes:
  Fast, easy, and convenient to use.
  Automatically timestamp and attribute the text.
  Page doesnt need to be locked while user is typing their comment.
Oh.. and macros and some formatting can be used in comments.. The lack of option to preview is another drawback. Users/JevanGray Jevan

I like the comment boxes, especially on business listings, because it gives the reader some idea of community opinion of a merchant. On pages other than business listings, I can appreciate CTs concern, but theyre still a convenient way for others to post questions that may not  really be appropriately incorporated into a page. And Im lovin the timestamp/attribute aspects! They give the reader an idea of how old/new a comment is and whos posting the info or query. CT... youve probably noticed yourself how inconvenient it is not to have a comment box on your personal page! It makes communication difficult. Stream of consciousness does have its place... comment boxes are like wiki sidebars! Users/AlphaDog

I concur with alphadog.  I have added many comment boxes myself, but I apologize for offending anyone by doing so Users/ChrisWaterstraat

Given the recent events with Michael777s comment being erased from the effects of alcohol page, and the subsequent argument, I wanted to pose question: When is it ok for an editor to delete a comment? There are plenty of pages that have comments that deviate from the pages topic, should they be cleaned up? Should the comment be moved to a more appropriate page? I can understand Michael777s annoyance about his edits disappearing, and think a little discussion could be good. users/AndrewPeake

I especially like that there IS NOT a comments box on the Comments page :D  Users/MasonMurray
