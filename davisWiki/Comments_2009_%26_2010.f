20090111 15:45:27 nbsp I had a terrible experience with them.  I was told theyd be 1015 minutes but I kept getting calls saying itll be five more minutes every ten minutes.  The driver arrived an hour after I was originally expecting him and told four of us to squeeze into a three person backseat while some girl was sitting in the passenger seat feeding him as he drove.  He claimed he was late because he kept getting sidetracked and he had to wait on some food.  I would strongly recommend going elsewhere for taxi services. Users/CPK138

20090508 01:02:25 nbsp Fuck friendly cab. They stood me and my girlfriend up for an hour. Dont ever call them. Your better off walking. Users/Kevincunninghan

20090620 11:59:29 nbsp One of the drivers is extremely creepy and unprofessional. I will never call them for a ride again, and I suggest all other women do the same.  Users/socrrox10

20091213 14:26:33 nbsp Do not use this taxi company. The driver ran two red lights and had to turn around multiple times because he didnt know where he was going. He then proceeded to tell a story about how he free based cocaine once and when he came to reality he realized he had been driving for hours. It is not safe. You would be safer walking, sleeping on the couch or calling a friend.  Users/MegRaye

Friendly Cab is for a friendly, pleasant, safe, timely and otherwise positive experience.  Unfortunately there have been some negative comments about rides.  I apologize for any bad experiences.  Efforts have been made to see that bad experiences donâ€™t happen again.  I have personally overwhelmingly heard positive comments about Friendly Cab.  I wish that those comments were the rule.

20100429 15:00:26 nbsp If I am paying for a cab because I cant drive myself, why the hell would I want a driver who is stoned out of his mind.  Because the cab situation sucks so bad in Davis (other than Davis Cab) I have tried to use Friendly Cab a number of times.  I would guesstimate that 70% of the times I called I could hear the driver and his friends smoking in the background...they said they were coming and never showed up...they said they would call back but never called...or just didnt answer the phone.  SERIOUSLY  Dont use them. Users/JCL95616

20100718 14:33:17 nbsp DO NOT CALL THESE CLOWNS!!!!  THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE IN BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES WHEN CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD MEAN EVERYTHING! I came downstairs and discovered my car had a flat, still had plenty of time to get to work. I called the number and a man told me he would be there to pick me up in 10 to 15 minutes.  I called back after 20 minutes and he sounded like he was overdosing on heroin! He literally could not complete a sentence over the phone, I thought this was some joke.  I called back 5 times and he did not answer the phone.  Finally I got through to someone who appeared to be sober and I told him of my conversation with his driver and he ended picking me up 1 hour after my initial call.  He did not charge me for the fare and he didnt have much to say about his drivers behavior.  THESE GUYS ARE A COMPLETE JOKE AND DO NOT DESERVE YOUR HARD EARNED TIME OR MONEY!!!
I am going to make every effort possible to inform everybody of this companys horrible service! Users/mikol

20100809 00:01:38 nbsp These half wits cant even communicate between each other to coordinate picking you up on time. We made an appt. to be picked up to go to the airport and these idiots never showed up. Then when we called the guy who answered the phone doesnt know anything about it and acts as if were bothering him. NICE WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS JACKASSES!!!! Users/PublicEnemyNumberOne

20100809 12:02:14 nbsp I had the pleasure of meeting a Friendly Cap driver as he was picking up a Slurpee at 7Eleven at the same time I was.  He was extremely friendly, and personable.  In the future, if I ever find myself in need of a Cap, I will be calling Friendly Cab and insisting on him (though I didnt get his name, Im sure the dispatcher will be able to identify him by description. Mid 30s to early 40s was driving a/the van) Users/MasonMurray

20100923 18:05:42 nbsp We know this business can be wild and crazy sometimes and just downright unforgiving. But in spite of the harangue and hullaballoo that goes on all around us, we know you send us business and give out our number... regardless of the reasons that you do, thank you! Pete, Bruce M., and Art, we at Village Cab appreciate every call because it keeps us on the move.  David Max Placencia

20101003 02:09:20 nbsp By far the worst cab experience Ive had in Davis. Im a fourth year and take more thank one cab a week. Friendly cab has no sense of customer service. I dropped my phone in the car and instead of going to where they dropped me off when I called the driver drove past at nearly 50 MPH on my residential street and failed to see me wave him down. Tracking my phone on mobileme I watched as he drove away then as my phone got stolen on a drop he made afterward. ART, the driver, felt no obligation to slow down even after my very generous tip of 40% on my fare. I will NEVER take this cab again. REST ASSURED. Users/AlexHandy

20101013 13:51:26 nbsp Last night I looked here and saw there were some comments since I commented on 20100226.  Im familiar with the previous comment, because I was the involved driver.  It was a hasty, negative and inaccurate comment of which the commenter has been aware for some time, but hasnt updated.  It was a busy night and I wasnt aware of him waving at me after he left his phone in the cab and I made a uturn at much less than 50 mph.  A couple of minutes later as I was picking up 3 young ladies who flagged me down, the dispatcher informed me that he called to say that he had left his phone.  I asked the ladies if they saw the phone;  they didnt.  With their permission I drove back out of their way to his drop off spot.  Unfortunately there was a miscommunication with the dispatcher that he had called him to tell him that I was back.  When I was carrying my next passengers from a call, the man called me directly.  I also asked those passengers if they saw the phone and they said they hadnt.  When I had driven a short distance from dropping off those passengers, he called me again and told me that the last place that he had tracked his phone from his computer was where I had dropped those passengers.  I drove back to him, called the passengers and was pleasantly surprised that they then discovered that they had his phone, having mistaken it for theirs.  I drove back and retrieved his phone.  You wouldnt know it from his comment, but he did take our cab again.  That was my only reward, except for the satisfaction of returning his phone and his good inperson words. Users/BruceHansen Art

20101220 16:43:05 nbsp How nice of you to retort when it has a positive outcome!!! What about my family and I being left on the curb waiting for your shitty cab service that never showed up or had the common courtesy to call.(hint:Thats called customer service) You almost cost us to miss our flight. If I see you in 711 I might have to knock your inconsiderate ass out. You have the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO OUT OF BUSINESS Users/PublicEnemyNumberOne
