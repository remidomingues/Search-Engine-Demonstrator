20050701 16:04:52 nbsp I remember being at one Grocery Outlet in Redwood City when I was 15 and found, among some thyme, pepper, and other spices, a gallon size container of MSG.  It was $12. Users/SteveLambert

20050906 17:16:03 nbsp There is also one of these stores in West Sac just North of the Harbor Blvd. Exit.  I bought a giant bag of Craisins for about half the price of what most stores sell the regular bags.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20051216 22:40:39 nbsp depressing place to shop.  Great location to find meth heads Users/DudeNude

20060502 20:08:34 nbsp If you are looking for ambiance, this is not it.  But if youre interested in crazy deals on groceries, there is no place better.  Plus you dont have to settle for crap food. Users/LizMoffitt

20060526 20:40:21 nbsp Occassionally Grocery Outlet will have some interesting Wines, making it somewhere besides Trader Joes, BevMo, CostCo and Sams to look for some interesting values.  I actually believe that the Woodland location has a better selection and not just of wines. Users/JaimeRaba

20070802 21:48:23 nbsp I found real Roquefort for $1.99 a pound. Seriously. It was labeled Random Weight Meat. Thats like 2 Euros per kilo. Im sure the French ambassador intervened, because I never saw it again.

Theyre based in Berkeley, and actually had a classy wine tasting for UC Berkeley staff. My advice on the wines is: 1) buy a bunch of bottles 2) go home and taste them 3) spit out your tastes so you can safely drive back and buy more of the ones you like. Users/BrianNeal

20110218 15:03:51 nbsp I was treated rudely while returning a vacuum that was missing an attachment and bags at the Midtown Sac store. As soon as the manager saw me, she asked with  suspicion, Didnt you just return a fan?. Yes, I said, because it was very wobbly (and the screw holding up the unit stripped the plastic hole but I decided not to continue telling her reasons, since things were looking rather bleak already). She went on to say that she sells a lot of vacuums and fans and shes never had anybody return them, and she kept repeating this point, implying that I was being dishonest. When I asked for my money back, she said that she can only give store credit or a gift card, and continued implying that I wasnt to be trusted, which I found disappointing and insulting. She didnt seem to care when I told her I would never shop at that Grocery Outlet again, and that I expect good quality products, as Grocery Outlet advertises, and that I expect those products have all of their parts as advertised on the box. This experience was especially disappointing because I shopped there often, sometimes every day.
