Printers offer professional offset printing services including fourcolor process, multi and singlecolor printing on specialty papers. Additional services may include design work, embossing, foil work, die cuts, letterpress and custom folds. Professional printers will often outsource services which they are not equipped to provide, but which are considered professional printing services, such as die cutting. The services offered by professional printers is typically considered of a higher quality than that available from color copy services, but the cost is significantly higher and requires larger volumes for cost efficiency; individuals interested in lowcost printing options such as club fliers may wish to look into shortrun digital printing options such as those offered by Graphic Express.
