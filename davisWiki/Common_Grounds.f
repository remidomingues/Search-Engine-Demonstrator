Common Grounds is an independentlyowned Cafes coffee shop.  They provide couches and Comfy Chairs comfy chairs, as well as free WiFi Hot Spots wireless internet (Instaconnect), and tiny rocking chairs for kids. The place looks a lot like Central Perk from the TV show Friends, kinda. They serve good Coffee coffee, and yummy Frozen Drinks smoothies, though their chai is not the greatest.  People are less inclined to share tables than they are at Mishkas Cafe when it gets packed (as it often is). Though it does have a nice Study Spots study environment, it closes at 9PM, so its not for night owls.

Common Grounds also has a good selection of eatables including macaroons, madeleines, brownies, and candy truffles  the same kind that you will find at Mishkas, formerly made by Vevey Confections, and they accept debit and credit cards for payment unlike many coffee shops around town.

The shop is often nice and cozy, which is awesome for relaxing in the chairs.  Big windows make it pretty bright.

They have a bunch of magazines and some Bookstores books in case you forgot your reading material, but they tend to be limited to 50 copies of Fit Pregnancy.  This is also a Crossing Zone for Bookcrossing bookcrossers, so some of the seemingly abandoned books on the shelf are hoping to go home with someone.  Check for the label/sticker to see if youve found a traveling book.

The restrooms have been noted to be spacious, clean, wellstocked and wellmaintained.  They have a monthly drink special which they offer throughout the week between two and six.

If you had heard rumors about some guy  erm  pleasuring himself in public who struck here, be reassured: he was caught in the act by the DPD and arrested in October 2012.  He was apparently subtle enough in his manipulations that most people in the packed place didnt even realize what had happened when he was arrested.

They have a wiki:woodland:Common grounds Woodland location as well.

 History 


In 2013, the Floridabased landlord Regency Centers refused to renew Common Grounds lease in order to make room for a pet food store, and possibly a Starbucks drivethrough kiosk. Common Grounds was suddenly homeless and it seemed as though the last day open would be Easter Sunday.  A http://www.change.org/petitions/regencycenterspleaseallowcommongroundscoffeetostayinitslocation change.org petition was started to save the coffee shop.  Local dignitaries such as Joe Krovoza and Mariko Yamada joined in the phone call and writing effort.  And indeed, Common Grounds was later resurrected; on April 8, the owners posted the following to the businesss Facebook page:

 Dear Friends, (customers seems insufficient with regards to this matter)
 Thanks to your overwhelming support, courage and taking time out of your busy lives to write letters of support we have come to an agreement with the landlord. We are grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve you at our new location adjacent out old location next door! We look forward to welcoming you in three months time and personally thank you for your support. This would not be possible without your help. Grateful, Son & Michelle.

One Facebook commenter wrote, The new spot has a patio area on the same side as the patio area for Dos Coyotes. There are more tables (and a fountain) inbetween. It should be very nice  more outdoor seating, a better indoor area... Can hardly wait for 3 months!

20060128 16:52:16 nbsp The owner of Common Grounds was my neighbor for several years and I can assure everyone that hes neither a Nazi nor a bastard.  Ive bought coffee at Common Grounds literally hundreds of times and never had an issue.  Im no expert when it comes to coffee, but I know what I like and I like both the people and coffee at Common Grounds. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20060128 18:01:45 nbsp The chai here is bad. But otherwise, I like this place. The internet is a bit slow, though.  Users/ApolloStumpy

20060213 09:08:52 nbsp This is a great little coffee house in a suburban shopping center (Safeway, officeMax, RiteAid). Great atmosphere, with friendly attractive staff (the females plus the occasional guy behind the counter). Coffee is great, cant comment on chai, never had it. Downsides: in the late afternoon the sun blasts directly into the windows and makes it really hot, even in winter. Hard to see your laptop screen when it competes with solar rays. The couches are not comfy, old springs that swallow you up. The crowd here tends to be older than downtown coffeehouses, some suburban housewives and professionals plus your usual Davis students. Great place overall, one of the best in Davis. Users/HughToppe HT

20060908 09:14:31 nbsp Im sad I wont find myself in South Davis as much now that Ive moved, and wont be able to frequent this place. Its one of my favorites, Toffee Frappe is awesome. Users/ChristyMarsden

20060913 08:52:52 nbsp Common Grounds has some of the worst music Ive ever heard. Ive often been driven to ear plugs or ipod while sitting there and once I walked in, heard the music, and walked out figuring Dos would be easier than sticky sweet popish country.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20060913 15:22:50 nbsp My favorite cold drink is the White Mocha Frappe (frapay). I like this place a lot. Its one of the only South D coffee shops. Lame that its only open until 9 though!! Users/RachelCakes

20060929 17:16:44 nbsp I know flies in Davis are generally bad this time of year, but the flies here in this cafe are particularly FEROCIOUS!  They start to swarm, chase each other, and mate even, right on your table, hair, book, or computer.  Ownership needs to put up fly traps. Or gets some of door blower thingies.  They become particularly wild when the sun starts to fade, like theyre trying to grab that last little bit o sunshine. Users/AnnieSirrah

20061027 10:35:40 nbsp i am so glad that picture includes kalies car, which she probably abandoned at dukes the night before Users/KailaGlassburner

20070318 11:59:07 nbsp Their coffee is absolutely terrible. It was extremely watered down and bitter. They also dont have a refund system, so they offer to make you another drink. Ew, Id rather not take a chance with something from your espresso machine, especially after I tried my friends mocha. Its such a shame that the only coffee shop (sans Sbux, which I dont support) in South Davis is so terrible.  Users/ElizabethAbinante

20070525 12:38:50 nbsp The coffee is good, and it is a nice place to study.  Bring an ipod, the music is worse than starbucks music.  It is just bad, but that and its early closing time are the only big downsides. Users/BenjaminRosenstein

20080130 20:55:52 nbsp I really like their low fat pumpkin muffin. Users/QS
2/25/08 Update: Sad to say, their service is quite lacking.  Last time I was there, the counter girl was very unfriendly and wouldnt even muster a smile.  She gave me a pumpkin scone instead of a muffin and when I went back to let her know, she didnt even say sorry and made it seem like I was hassling her.  My mocha was watered down and tasteless.  I brought my own mug and she wrote on it with the pencil they use to write on their paper cups and now it wont wash off.  I didnt say anything at the time because I thought it was removable.  It wasnt like the place was even busy.  Ive worked at a restaurant before and I never gave any customers an attitude no matter how busy or frazzled I was.

20080203 23:28:58 nbsp Are they hiring? I need a job! Users/CourageCowardlyDog

20080304 10:41:07 nbsp This place is hands down fabulous!!! They have great drinks and great service along with a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere. They are the ONLY place that remembers customers names and orders which is remarkable especially at 6am.  I wouldnt count on trusting the reviews that say they offer service that is lacking, you have to try this place for sure!!! Users/JessieShen

To say that my review regarding the service cant be trusted is rather antagonistic on your part.  I know what my experience was like and I am only describing it as it was.  QS

20080308 16:33:16 nbsp I LOVE this place! The service is fast, the staff are great, and the owner does of a good job of making people feel like regulars. The study area rocks...I dont know of a comfier place in town. The one major bummer 9:00 closing time!  How about some extended hours...at least during finals...please! Users/AllyAnaheim

20080312 22:33:40 nbsp Yeah, they definitely need to stay open longer! Users/at86

20080711 13:45:53 nbsp I really love this place for studying and doing work. The environment is pleasant  the music is never too loud or obtrusive, the entire staff is really nice and chatty, and the drinks Ive had are good (admittedly, mostly just mochas, a few other coffees, and a lot of their teas). The place is comfortable, even if not in the sofas, and has tons of natural light. It also mentions above that the place gets pretty crowded. I have been here at all sorts of times, and even when it has been at its most crowded, I have always been able to get a seat too, so it has been worth coming. I definitely recommend it if you like studying in coffee shops Users/NickSantos

20080724 13:59:12 nbsp This is my favorite coffee shop in Davis.  I find Mishkas too crowded, but Ive always been able to find a seat here.  The couches are super comfy, the coffee is delicious (though Im no expert), and despite what some others have said, the music is not bad at all!  As I sit here now, theyre playing classical piano music, and when I was studying for finals, it was midcentury jazz.  Nothing wrong with that!  But yes, there are lots of flies.  If youre the type of person that gets that tickley feeling when you think about bugs, you might want to sit outside instead (fewer flies, no joke).  Otherwise this place is ideal. Users/WinButler

20080822 22:29:11 nbsp You MUST try their KONA MOCHA!!! Users/Terry

20080902 13:20:10 nbsp I think Ive tried all the nonhippie/Hoopie offcampus coffee places in Davis now, and this is my favorite place to work.  The atmosphere is very conducive to study/work and I do appreciate the choice between table or comfy chair.  Somewhat surprisingly, the place is not constantly packed, although that may change when classes get under way.  The staff has always been professional  no problems there.  My only complaint, shared with others, is that the fly problem is real.  Its really unappetizing to see a fly crawling over the pastry Im thinking of ordering.      Users/DataPoint

20080905 11:33:29 nbsp I was here last night.  Ive always wanted to like this place, but I didnt like the coffee.  I ordered just a regular coffee and it was undrinkable.  Too bitter and. . . something.  It wasnt good.  Its a good study spot and I love the free internet, but the coffee was disgusting.  I dont know about their espresso drinks, but I dont know that Im willing to try it after last night.  Users/CurlyGirl26

20081116 20:43:11 nbsp The internet is slow because half the time theres 20 or 25 people all on their laptops in one place. the coffee is...maybe a 3.5 out of 5 not bad.   Users/Chrissapher

20081213 19:13:40 nbsp I looooooooove their chai! I guess its only for people who like sweet things, but thats some good stuff. Users/ArielleWeiler

20090104 18:28:43 nbsp Decent place to study, bleh tasting coffee.  But it is perplexing.  Why are there still flies here in the WINTER when they have long departed the rest of Davis?  I bet you the fly larvae are hatching in the couches or in the plant soil. Users/AnnieSirrah

20090105 01:01:21 nbsp or in the plant soil...
Nope. Users/DonShor

20090425 17:24:00 nbsp The staff here are really nice and its a great place to grab some coffee/tea and study!  Frappes are excellent! Users/cfb

20090825 22:57:27 nbsp I really like this place. I have had several drinks there and I always enjoy myself. I am sad I cant tip more though. The employees are really nice. Users/Dozer

20090828 13:51:03 nbsp What an incredible place run my some incredible people.  You can always count on a great cup o Joe and a comfy place to sit! But I also want to mention that the owner has been a fantastic member of the Davis Community.  Hes been very generous with a number of organizations and in a town like ours, thats just good business.  Sun rocks! Users/toriac

20090927 19:23:22 nbsp great coffee. Its a good place to spend your afternoon. Users/kkash

20091019 14:08:50 nbsp The atmosphere is comfortable and laid back. You can study for hours without being hassled. The coffee is mediocre and the pastries are awful. He apparently gets them delivered from San Francisco on a daily basis but they are so bad. I wonder why he doesnt use a local bakery he could get better tasting food and use less fossil fuels.  Users/Chaz

20091110 23:40:07 nbsp Hi, Im Jason, chances are I may have made you a latte if youve been to our shop before.  Im just posting here to let people know that we are trying to become a part of second friday here in Davis.  Common Grounds is looking for local artists to come share their art in different areas.  We are looking for all sorts of artists whether youre into painting, sculpting, pottery, poetry, accoustic music we would like to invite to put your craft on display and talk about it.  If interested call or stop in and ask for Jason or leave your contact information including email so we can schedule a time.  Thanks to everybody who posts on here, we really like the input.   Users/JasonA

20091111 11:24:34 nbsp This is a great local business. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the coffee is quite good. I ordered some large carafes for an early business meeting and, afterwards, everyone kept commenting on how great the coffee was. The owner is an active member of the community. You can find Common Grounds at most city events (like Celebrate Davis). Users/GJC02

20091120 17:34:31 nbsp Common grounds is a first class coffee house.  The pastries are good; the coffee is excellent.  Its great to have a comfy place with wifi, but Common Grounds is a great place to meet up with people and socialize.  It exemplifies a neighborhood coffee house with top notch service.  The owner is an example of what a business owner in a town like Davis SHOULD be.  He is personable, knows most of his regulars and often supports various community organizations.  Five stars! Users/toriac

20100311 09:25:02 nbsp Ive been going here for years and it has some of the best coffee in town and great customer service.  A nice place to sit and chat or study! Users/cfb

20100317 19:20:33 nbsp I have been living in South Davis for the past 2 months and I gotta say this is the best coffee place around. The coffee actually tastes like coffee, not like what you get at the campus locations that is for sure. I recommend the spicy/sweet Chai Latte! Also, their free wifi is considerably fast even when 10 or so laptops are connected to their network. Oh and their staff are really nice and fun to keep a conversation when you are taking a break from studying. The only criticism i have is that this place closes WAAAAY to early (9pm), basically I get there after dinner and its already closing!  Users/tonyh

20100513 11:14:52 nbsp Love the relaxed feel of this place, but at the same time, not too laid back. They have toys/books for kids so theyre obviously kid friendly! Users/LeeY

20100630 19:07:53 nbsp This is a great place to study! I think it simply raised my grades:) I would totally recommend this coffee place to anyone, and please indulge in the ham and cheese croissant.  Users/caitlin22

20101008 08:55:18 nbsp I have ordered coffee, tea and pastries for meetings and events from Common Grounds for years.  Because theyre so close to campus, its easy to pick up orders or have them delivered.  They are rocksolid dependable and the owner is awesome.  I love the berry scones!   Users/AMcAdow

20110306 22:30:43 nbsp My favorite coffee shop in all of Davis, even better than the CoHo! I love their iced mochas on a hot day. The chairs are comfortable, the tables plentiful, and the wifi is pretty fast. I love studying and bringing friends to chat with here. The atmosphere is conducive to both, surprisingly enough.  Users/kthrnngo

20110406 20:48:01 nbsp This is such a wonderful place! The Portland blend coffee is my favorite. They also have the best chocolate because they make it there...yummy. Now I want a mocha just thinking about it. Users/MaryMurphy

20110427 20:36:03 nbsp For some reason the industrial size refrigerators that used to kept in a back room somewhere have now been moved out in the coffee bar space beside the front counter. THEYRE VERY LOUD. Also, electrical cables leading back to the back room along the corridor floor could be tripped over by the unwary. Not a good move, IMHO. Users/BrianOrr
  Theyre remodeling. Users/DonShor
    And now theyre done and the refrigerators are back in the back.  DS

20111129 15:39:00 nbsp the flies are driving me nuts. Users/NickKory

20111217 19:17:03 nbsp Keep an eye on the barista that’s making your drink. Some of baristas feel it’s OK to serve food when they’re sick. The barista that was making my drink was sick. I complained and they refused to refund my money and wouldn’t give me the owner’s information. Users/customer123

20120430 22:48:43 nbsp To their credit, they arent afraid of letting people know what others think of them: they post direct links to Yelp and the Davis Wiki on their home page. Thats courage and sincerity. Users/SteveDavison

20130329 15:34:01 nbsp Wow, this sucks. Common Grounds will always be the place I studied for the bar, and was ultimately hospitable. Users/ScottLay

20130330 06:22:29 nbsp I was just looking for commercial Landlord/Tenant laws and found something which may apply here, were Regency Centers not to have given adequate notice of their decision not to renew the lease: http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/CIV/5/d3/4/5/2.6/s1954.31      ScottLay, maybe you can shed some light as to whether or not this is applicable? (Also, yeah this for real sucks.) Users/RobinAlexander
 Well, Im guessing the story didnt begin this week. There has been contention between Common Grounds and the shopping center for years, after Safeway added Starbucks and Common Grounds contended that it violated CGs lease (standard noncompete clause). Users/ScottLay

 Its fine to not like Starbucks, but it doesnt appear the chain is the true villain here. Its a simple case of a national landlord maximizing the dollar at the cost of local business, perhaps leading to more pet food in town. Users/ScottLay

20130408 16:21:24 nbsp Woo hoo!!!  Glad to hear that Common Grounds is staying in Oakshade after all!  Independent businesses like Common Grounds form the backbone of our community. Users/CovertProfessor

20131005 22:38:05 nbsp The new location is gorgeous and needs photos, perhaps a rewrite of the appearance is appropriate at this point.  The three pictures currently on the page are of the old location. Users/JudithTruman

20131227 14:41:12 nbsp I visited the new location for the first time today. It does look great. New menu on wall is nice. Outdoor seating a big plus. Feels more spacious. On the downside, wish they had more couches and Instaconnect Hotspot internet did not cut it for me (kept getting knocked off, and theoretically I will be limited to 30 hours/month for free).  Users/MichaelPlotkin
