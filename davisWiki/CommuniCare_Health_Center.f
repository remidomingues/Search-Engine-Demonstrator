20100408 08:20:31 nbsp I make 2,000 dollars/month and apparently with that kind of income they charge 180 for an office visit.  Thats about the same as Sutter. Users/AmandaAbughosh
  Are you sure that Sutters prices arent at least double or triple that?  Its been years since Ive been treated at Sutter, but I think I got charged something like $450 for a fiveminute appointment.  Users/ScottMeehleib

  Yes, I am sure that Sutters prices arent at least double or triple that.  The base office visit is 180.  Of course, if they take tests or anything, Im sure it would be more.  Users/AmandaAbughosh

20101103 16:16:22 nbsp Patients who have no form of health coverage are asked to pay for services provided according to a sliding fee scale. The minimum amount on the sliding scale is $30 for an office visit, not $180. You can confirm this for yourself by calling the clinic. Users/JohnBonner
