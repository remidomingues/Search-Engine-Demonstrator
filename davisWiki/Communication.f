Communication is one of the smaller University departments departments on campus. Until Fall 2006, they didnt even have any graduate students, which made it harder to fill TA positions. Because of the historical drought of Teaching assistants TAs in the department, the faculty tends to use multiple guess testing more often than other departments. Some people (especially the faculty) believe that the department gives difficult multiple guess tests. Users/WilliamLewis Others disagree.

Like many other departments, communications role is mostly servicing students outside of the major. For example, all Engineering students engineering Undergraduate students undergrads are required to take either CMN 1 or CMN 3. The large number of engineering majors and the small number of faculty and graduate students often means that those classes in particular are often difficult to get into.

The department offers an AB to undergrads as well as a minor. The graduate program offers an MA with both a thesis and a nonthesis track. The department does not currently offer a PhD.

The department (like all communication departments) has been a target of ridicule because of the major and subjects perceived easiness. One of the more visible examples of this was California Aggie Aggie Columnist Garrett McCords statement that communication is The penny candy of majors.
