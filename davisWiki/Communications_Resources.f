CRs Mission is to support the Universitys teaching, research and public service functions through the provision of a suite of modern, reliable, secure, and costeffective telecommunications services. In plain English, that means they run the network hardware (NAMs, routers, switches, wiring, phones) for campus.

Note: They cant decide if they are Communication Resources or Communications Resources. Their website lists them both ways several times. So much for communication...
