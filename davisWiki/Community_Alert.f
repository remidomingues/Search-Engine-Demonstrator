With ongoing really weather hot temperatures, please watch for animals in distress! Leave a little dish of water out for outdoor cats in the shade in front areas, watch for dogs left in parked cars, be brave and kindly let folks know who are out in midday walking their dogs that hot pavement burns dogs feet. We are also seeing more outdoor owned cats in distress as folks are conserving water and there is not runoff for them to drink and less damp shady grass to rest in.

If you see a dog in a parked car, call the Davis Police Department police nonemergency line and have the store page the car owner. If you need to, break a window away from the animal so it doesnt hurt them. FYI cars with cracked windows are still too hot and often even if all the windows are open they are still too hot.
