HDE 220: Research Methods in Human Growth and Development
Katherine Masyn
Regardless of the title of the course, this class is actually a class in research design applicable to everyones interests.  In it you will get lots of support in picking and refining a research question for your thesis, writing your literature review, and deciding on the methods appropriate to your research question.  Weekly assignments and readings make it a lot of work but very well worthwhile.  You will also end up with a good deal of the introductory material to your thesis paper written (or at least drafted).  It is offered in the spring, which makes it a great time to get your thesis ideas planned out to be able to start actually doing the research over the summer or in the fall of your second year in the program, especially if you make use of one of the two twoquarter classes in field work during your second year (Edu. 205 a/b and Soc. 292 a/b). Katherine is very helpful and fun.  Part of her course is designed to help students understand and critique statistical articles.  You arent held responsible for this information so you can pursue it to the extent that you find it helpful to you.  She is a statistician so her strengths are more in quantitative methods than in qualitative methods but the class is still a great start to your research for folks that anticipate using qualitative methods.

Sociology 156: Social Movements
professor varies
I have really enjoyed this class and found it very relevant to community development interests in broad social change.  It basically goes over the the different theories of how social movements form and what their outcomes are.  Unfortunately the sociology dept. doesnt seem to have committed a regular faculty member to teach it but they do seem to offer it regularly with outside lecturers.  Keep your eyes peeled for a graduate version of this class that may be taught in the future by new professor Michael McQuarrie.

ESP 298: Education for Sustainable Living Action Research Project
Joan Ogden
Offered only in Spring. Allows graduate students to develop a project that addresses some issue related to sustianability on campus equity in labor, food system, energy, transportation limited only by your imagination.  You recruit undergrads to be a part of your team, who also get credit.  Several CRD students have developed projects that are applicable to their theses.  Dont miss this opportunity!

LDA 202: Community Participation Methods
Patsy Eubanks Owens
This was a really great, handson course. We worked with a youth group in South Sacramento and helped them write a grant proposal/action plan for youth development in their community.  It took a lot of outofclass time attending meetings, etc, but there wasnt a lot of reading and writing, which was a nice break from all the theory classes.  Also Patsy rocks!

MGT 2912: Social Entrepreneurship
Cleve Justis
Im currently taking this course, and Im finding it very valuable. It has guest speakers each week, and they range from insightful nonprofit management consultants to venture philanthropists to founders of sociallyresponsible companies and nonprofits. You learn practical skills as well. Contact the professor about getting in next year: MailTo(ctjustis AT ucdavis DOT edu).

CRD 160:Research Methods
Bob Pence
I took this to fulfill my research methods requirement. Its a VERY basic undergraduate course. I did learn some things, but I wouldnt recommend it unless you really need an intro to social science research. The professor was great, but he left. Ive heard from undergrads that the current instructor is not engaging.

CRD 160: Qualitative Research Methods
Bernadette Tarallo
A good overview of qualitative research methods for those of us for whom itâ€™s been a while!

CRD 164: Community Change Organizations
Jonathan London
Great basic overview of how organizations work, how to optimize performance in organizations and teams; good readings; lots of group activities.
I took this class when it was offered by Frank Hirtz, before he was taken over by the administration borg.  Good class  but basically the undergrad version of 242.  Had more group writing (with a great structure) and less depressing why does it all matter existential blahness than 242.

CHI 72 + 172: Chicano Art Expression / Silkscreen Workshop
Malaquias Montoya
Take this class, whether youre an artist or not!!! Malaquias has a lifes worth experience as a political artist, teacher, and activist.  Hes got an incredible eye for design and wordage in political art/propoganda.  Hes insightful and nurturing, idealistic and demanding. If you want to bring about the revolution, you need to know how to take your message to the streets.  Handson skills galore.

SAS 130: Contemporary Leadership
Learn your leadership style and build upon your leadership skills

CRD 241: Community Economic Development
Martin Kenney
Okay, start out by saying I didnt take this class.  Why?  Because Mr. Kenney was rude, inappropriate, and sexist during the first day of class.  He redesigned the class to remove the Community aspect AND so that all students basically did his research (for free) as their primary graded assignment.  Research to help the Biotech industry, no less, when half the class were sustainable agriculture people, who find biotech morally reprehensible.  Why is this worth complaining about here?  Because Economic Development is a class I wanted to learn from, and had waited one year to take  so at the last second I scrambled for another course. So think strategically  know that you will need to gain these skills OUTSIDE the department unless you are one of the rare few who see eye to eye with Martin Kenney.
