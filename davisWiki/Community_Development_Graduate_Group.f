CommunityBased Research

3 year study of Bryte and Broderick

During the Winter Quarter of 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Community Development Graduate Group is working with the West Sacramento neighborhoods of Bryte and Broderick through our capstone course, CRD 440. This collaboration gives graduate students realworld experience with communitybased research, while connecting the communities of Bryte and Broderick with UC Davis resources. Reports, maps, and presentations have resulted from this collaboration, and are available at the Research on West Sacramento wiki site for public access.

For more information, contact Bernadette Austin: MailTo(braustin AT ucdavis DOT edu)

Course Guide

See the Community Development Graduate Course Guide for a ton of advice from past and current students.  Its got: course listings for specializations, recommended courses, and notsorecommended courses.  Learn from other students experiments with the course catalog!  Its great!

Getting Employed by the University

Working for the university is a great way to get your fees paid for  and to keep yourself from scheduling foibles and commuting to an offcampus job every day. But beware: it also means your head will get entirely wrapped up in academialand pseudologic. Proceed at your own risk...

Teaching Assistant Jobs

These jobs pay more money than Research Assistantships AND are covered by the Union. They are a great way to get paid to learn about a new topic  and to get some teaching experience. Applications are a pain  you have to apply to each department separately, and they all have different due dates and application forms.

Hiring: Get started early  as soon as January before the year you want to be hired.  Some TA ships are handed out by the department in a single review process during the summer (like Community Development).  Other departments (like American Studies) hire as early as March. However, if you really want first choice, you should start emailing professors of your favorite classes picked out from the UCD catalog in January or February, with a cover letter and a resume.  If you show initiative and seem qualified, many professors will hire you before the big departmental roundup of applications. Make sure you get a contract, so you dont get forgotten or overlooked when someone better comes along  these contracts are issued as much as a year in advance of the position you are hired for.

These jobs are union!  That means when your professor wants to work you more hours than youre getting paid for (which is way more common than it should be), the union comes in, saves you, and gets you back pay.  Administration will discourage you from contacting the union  especially if your contract is being violated.  Dont listen to them!  The union is your friend, and once the wheels get rolling they really go to bat for TAs! But sometimes the TA union is slow and/or lost about replying to messages, so be persistant if you need their help.

Research Assistant Jobs

These jobs pay less, but might be a good match if you are on a professional track, or if you can find an RAship that matches your research interest.  They also typically save you from having to switch bosses/jobs each quarter, as you often do with TAships. Many of these jobs are misnamed, and you do no research whatsoever, but instead coordinate programs, do outreach to the community, etc. No union here, so you better get yourself a fair boss.
