The http://www.indavis.com/CommunityFoodDrive/ Community Food Drive is an annual event sponsored by service clubs (Rotary Club of Davis for one) that brings together schools Spiritual Organizations churches and Businesses in a joint effort to collect food.
  The external link only brings up information about the 5th Drive; the inDavis site has nothing easy to find about the 6th, during the Drive!  Users/DougWalter
