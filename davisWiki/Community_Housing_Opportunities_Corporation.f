Community Housing Opportunities Corporation is a nonprofit affordable housing organization whose stated mission is to increase the availability of affordable housing and to improve the quality of life for very low, low and moderate income households. Originally created within Davis in 1984 as Davis Community Housing, CHOC has sponsored the development of more than 1,100 units of affordable rental housing and 74 singlefamily homes. Its service area has since expanded to include communities in Yolo, Sacramento, Solano, and eastern Contra Costa counties. CHOC finances developments and programs through a blend of private and public funding, and handles both rental housing and home ownership development for low income households.

Rather than simply providing rental housing for low income households, CHOC takes a fourpronged approach to stabilizing low income communities: property development, property management, asset management and resident services. The property management aspect is handled through CHOC affiliate, Sterling Asset Management Company (SAMC), a licensed California real estate broker, approved by HCD and HUD, that serves exclusively as a property management agent; SAMC also provides feemanagement services to private owners of multifamily affordable housing. CHOC also operates propertyspecific resident services programs to help ground its low income communities and provide tools for resident success. This program  coordinates residentbased onsite professed educational, employment, wellness and recreational programs to promote community and personal growth.

Presently, CHOC has a pipeline of work in excess of $100m. This includes those projects in construction, ready to commence construction, and in design and construction document development. All projects consist of either new construction or acquisition rehabilitation activities or a combination of both. The project lines range from new mixeduse homeownership (both single and multifamily), affordable family housing, new underground utility and street infrastructure for mobile home parks, community and office work centers, HUD 202 senior independent living facilities, and assets requiring recapitalization for longterm sustainability and preservation.

CHOC is presently operating in and serving thirteen (13) counties in Northern Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. In the next year, CHOC is expanding its development and management operations to include the collar counties of the San Francisco East Bay Area.   Its product lines are also expanding to include market rate housing and commercial development, market rate management and leasing, and asset sustainability services.  source: http://www.chochousing.net/realestate/productlines



20081227 09:48:02 nbsp CHOC is all about appearances keeping the outside looking nice for when the investors inspect the properties. Therefore, if you are a tenant, do not expect them to  repair things in your apartment that are not cosmetic . Example: I was unable to flush my toilet with the handle (broken off) for approximately one month. My heater was broken in December. Despite repeated calls to get these items repaired, they finally remedied the situation on the day the inspectors came to the property and entered the apartment. Once again, its about keeping up appearances for the inspections. Twice a year the building lights need to be adjusted to the time. Each time we report a needed adjustment, we end up waiting several months before anything is done. Meanwhile, it is pitch black as we ascend the staircase to our apartments in the indoor stairwell and it is nearly impossible to see the keyhole to open the door. CHOC is liable for any accident that could occur to a tenant in this situation! Yet, they ignore it. These are just examples from a longer list of repairs that rarely or never happen. On the other hand, carpets in these same dark stairwells have been replaced,  parking areas have been paved and the outside of apartment buildings painted, while tenants wait forever for INSIDE repairs. In addition, the manager turnover rate is amazing. Since my 8 years of living here, we have gone through  at least SIX different managers!  Users/G.L.

20100121 16:43:27 nbsp Unbelievable. CHOC holds somewhere around 70 million in other peoples money and 20 million in their own, yet sitting beside my computer as I type is a form I must fill out by January 29, 2010 so they can get a Statement of Household Income for Filing of Welfare Exemption (20102011)! Meanwhile, on Federal Social Security Disability only now, having lost my entire SSI check to Governor Schwarzeneggers part in the Big 5 budget for 2009, I have no raise at all for COL expenses. My dental and vision, as paltry as it was on MediCal has also been taken away by either big business, big government, or both. And they want ME to sign this so they can get yet another write off? You want to hear horror stories? Ive lived in one of CHOCs properties for over 12 years now (13 in June) and have survived 4 floods by way of chemicals sprayed from faulty fire sprinklers (CHOC refused to pay for any of the damage to my furniture, rugs, etc.) and 40 days, literally of no hot water in the middle of the winter one year (after repeated complaints, CHOC coughed up a voucher to take a shower at the homeless shelter nearby...how very white of them) all while I was still expected to pay my full rent. CHOC is nothing but another greedy corporation, lying to investors as well as consumers. The truth is, their supposed low income housing is merely the slightest break they can give to lowincome people and still get their writeoffs. This form next to me proves it beyond any shadow of a doubt. (I tried to contact them at 4:30 p.m. and not suprisingly, the only option I had was to leave a message for operator. Riiight.) At the Hotel Woodland, for instance, the studio apartments are rented out to those who fill out all the paperwork about every nook and cranny of THEIR income and assets, and must do so every year to qualify, yet for all this what they get is literally a $20.00US break from Fair Market Value. That is NOT lowincome; that is greed. They need to be audited. Seriously. Users/S.
