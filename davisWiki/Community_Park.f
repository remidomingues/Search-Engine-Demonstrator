There is a Bike Overpasses bike overpass connecting the park to the The Greenbelt North Davis greenbelt that crosses over Covell. The park features two play areas: Rainbow City and the Roundhouse. There are Tennis Courts, a Public Skate Park skate park, many fields for soccer and a softball backstop with concrete stands. High school students ditching class come here, to the top of the softball stands known as The Ledge, to smoke and skate, possibly also to turn their backs in disdain to the skate park built by the man.

During the summer, the entire area is used by the Rainbow Summer summer camp, for kids grades K6. This is also the case for many parks during the summer, including Arroyo Park Arroyo and Slide Hill Park.

During the fall, if you wish to throw around a frisbee or play any other game you will have to find a spot in between the numerous soccer kids.  Be polite and find a spot where you wont hit the kids!  Although the park is large, it can be difficult (if not impossible) to find enough space to set up anything like a field.  If you just want to toss with a friend or two, youll probably be OK, but if youve got more than that, you may be out of luck.  Of course, if youve got a whole team with you, you could probably challenge them to a rumble and winchances are, most of you are bigger than most of them!

Sparked my interest in Civil War history, and led to many a fun time plotting how I could defend the place from the armies of Shade Arbor and the Solar Panels.  Users/CecilioPadilla
