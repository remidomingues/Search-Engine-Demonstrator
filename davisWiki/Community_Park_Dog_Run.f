The Community Park Dog Parks dog run is a nice place for dog owners to gather any time of the day from sunup to dusk. The park is also home to the SPCAs annual dog gone walkathon where local community members, dogs and UC Davis service organizations like Circle K International come together for a dog gone day of fun and a 2 mile marked walk.

Situated behind the high school and library and adjacent to the skate park, this dog run is an underused gem.  Periods of highest use are typically weekday evenings between 79pm, and occasionally weekend evenings.  A small but growing group of people and dogs have starting gathering here on a regular basis.  In the past, a group of small dog owners have informally used it as a small dog park until one was built at Toad Hollow. Hopefully they will grow into the new dog runwalkchasehopskipscramble.

Periods of highest use, on the other hand, often coincide with the regular use of the park. A small but growing group of Davisites wearing birkenstocks and fuzzy socks gather here on an irregular basis to take up the green.
Some notable regulars at the Community Park dog run have included: Dora the Explorer (schnoxie; featured in the July 2008 edition of Davis Life magazine), Allie (the Smartest Puppy in the World), boy Scout (Corgi), girl Scout (Westie), Maverick (Schnauzer), Dante the Gentle Giant (Rottweiler), Dylan the BallObsessed (lab, of course), Rudy the Rowdy Poodle, and other occasional guests.


Advantages to this dog run include:
  increased owner vigilance and responsibility, both in terms of keeping an eye ones dog as well as being held accountable for cleanup after ones dog.
  less of a Wild West flavor due to smaller size and number of dogs leads to fewer incidents of aggression and chaos
  proximity to restrooms:  there are 2 clean, wellmaintained city restroom structures nearby
  nonstop doggie TV: this is a wellused park and there are always skaters/bikers in the skate park, ultimate games, soccer practices, strollers/runners/bikers passing, all providing a little doggie TV when there happen to be no other dogs for your pooch to play with
  guy with ice cream push cart passes fairly regularly
  convenient central location allows for much stopping in of new and unfamiliar dogs, providing an opportunity for training your dog in meeting/greeting

Some areas for improvement include:
  access to water: currently there is no water fountain or spigot within the dog run (the abovementioned city restroom structures are nearby, however soccer moms have been known to scowl when dogs are invited to use the fountains)
  lack of parking directly adjacent to the park: for those who choose to or must drive, parking is available by the high school or the art center
  singledoor access: double door entrances provide extra security from escapes as well as space for dogs to get preacquainted through mesh
  city shuts down dog park for bicycle valet use during major events
  unreliability of finding other dogs to play with: since this dog run is generally underused, dogs occasionally have walked away disappointed.

If Dogs Run Free

If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain.
The best is always yet to come,
Thats what they explain to me.
Just do your thing, youll be king,
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme.
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be,
To each his own, its all unknown,
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, then what must be,
Must be, and that is all.
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall.
In harmony with the cosmic sea,
True love needs no company,
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,
If dogs run free.
Bob Dylan
