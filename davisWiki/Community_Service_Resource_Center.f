Come to the Community Service Resource Center!  We are a program within the Internship and Career Center at UC Davis.  It is out mission to connect campus members with the community at large, and to build relationships within the campus, the community, the state, and our world. The CSRC seeks to promote service through action, allowing people to see the extraordinary changes that everyday people are capable of initiating. The CSRC also promotes commitment and dedication to service; it is our aim to widen an ethic of service throughout Davis. We support leadership through service, with the knowledge that making service a part of oneâ€™s life builds leadership, responsibility, and moral judgment.
