Compass Fellowship meets regularly on Fridays at 7:30 PM. They meet at Davis Chinese Christian Church which is near Rite Aid across from U Mall. They are an English speaking fellowship, and  though tends to have a significant amount of Asian Americans, its clearly open to everyone.

The typical Friday includes singing worship songs, small group Bible Study or Discovery Group (for new Christianity Christians or people seeking to learn more), snacks that students take turns bringing (this tends to be pretty good as some people are quite good at baking or cooking) and sometimes an activity afterwards like hanging out at someones house and playing board/card games, frying some good food, watching movies, etc. The fellowship is connected to the church.  Several adults going to the church volunteer as advisers, however for the most part it is a studentrun fellowship.

They also host a New Student Group (NSG) usually on Wednesdays at 7:30 PM. Generally, they play games and do activities to help you get to meet people like transfers and freshmen, but anyone is welcome to join. Compass has many teams playing for a variety of intramural sports and has regular retreats. Theres an email list that you can sign up for that the welcoming people ask you if you want to join when you first come in and they email you telling you whats happening that week, even highlighting important announcements.

20140128 14:21:00 nbsp I went here quite a few years back and really like DCCC. I was a small group leader one year and not much else.

I like how they push early on for freshmen to run things themselves after a couple quarters. Formats change and I think of it as a very studentrun fellowship and its great cause it tends to give a ownership and selfdiscovery, which solidifies a persons faith much more, thats not to say God doesnt bring/challenge students to teach good stuff and be legit and provide resources/people to them. Consequently there can be turmoil in the process of figuring things out, but the fruits I think are rich.

I also can personally vouch for CRU (Epic and Real Life) , DCF, IV and many others, I appreciated and found people there to pray with on campus, DCCC has a prayer meeting too, but I think its a shame not to be praying for one another or in the habit of spurring each other toward love and good deeds and prayer and faith in God through prayer. Of course make sure to reach out there and make new friends and season your speech with salt and grace.
