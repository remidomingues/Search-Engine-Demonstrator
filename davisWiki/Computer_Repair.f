Computer need fixin? Weve compiled a list of places where you can get your computer fixed in Davis and in the surrounding areas.  It is recommended that you get a clear agreement as to which services will be performed.  For example, if restoration or virus removal is promised, will your computer be restored to its previous state, so that you can use it immediately?  Or will only the data be retained, requiring you to restore your own settings?  In addition to computer repair, Davis is home to many other business to business services.

   users/MasonMurray is currently not a professional repairman, possesses no certifications, and is often available if youd care to buy him a drink or 3 and hang out or have a quick question.  However, leaving your computer with him tends to lead to 3+ mo. repair jobs.  Especially when they only offer a vague promise of recompense.
