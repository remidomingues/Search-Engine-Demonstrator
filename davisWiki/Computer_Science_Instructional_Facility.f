In the basement of Kemper Hall (formerly known to much of the staff and some upperclassmen as EU II) lies the Computer Science Instructional Facility (CSIF), commonly referred to as The Dungeon. It consists of five lab rooms as well as a support room. All Computer Science and CSE majors, as well as anyone taking a CS class, get a login for the CSIF computers. Most every reasonable CS class in UC Davis that accepts programs for homework will require them to compile on CSIF computers, because theyll most likely be graded from there.

If you want to avoid the dungeon to the greatest extent possible, install Linux on your machine. You can SSH into the CSIF computers through Terminal if you run an Apple operating system. For Windows, you will need http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ PuTTY.

The computers that make up the CSIF are named .cs.ucdavis.edu. There are 67 Linux/Intel PCs, named pcN.cs.ucdavis.edu where N ranges from 1 to 60. As of Fall 2006, many computers down here are dual headed. They can be SSHed into from anywhere, even off campus, a viable solution for those who want to work at home and are not bothered by latency. If you want to remote in from home, this quick and dirty Computer Science Instructional Facility/Login Script shell script will find the machine with the lowest load and log you in to that one. The machines cover a fair range of speeds and manufacturers. The far south lab, room 67, has the computers with decent graphics cards for graphics work, and used to contain a bunch of HPUX machines but they were replaced with some kind of Solaris tomfoolery in Summer 05.

At a time now past, the labs were populated with a wider variety of hardware, with DEC Ultrix DECstations, HPUX and SGI MIPS workstations represented.


Most accounts on the CSIF servers are limited to a X50X 100 meg quota, though taking certain Computer Science classes like ECS175 will get you a quota boost for that quarter only. The low disk quota is the cause of about 90% of the questions to CSIF support, because when you try to login after exceeding quota youre just met with a cryptic error message.

One rationale for the low quota is the heavy backups made for CSIF accounts. Type cd .snapshot in any directory and youll see hourly, daily, and weekly backups for its files. This is handy if youve accidentally deleted something, or you just want to use it as extremely primitive version control.

A login for CSIF gives students 200 pages of printing in this lab separate from the campus X100X X90X 30 (budget cuts) page quota. CS and CSE students are often found coming to the labs to print toward the end of the quarter when their campus quota is exceeded. At one point in time, your CSIF print quota would actually increase as you printed.

The printer room has become a transient resting place for old textbooks. Books are randomly deposited, only to be rummaged through by the CS student populace.  There are some decent books, such as an older edition of the MINIX text (sometimes used in ECS 150), a treatise by Knuth complete with a picture of Knuth on a horse, various MATLAB texts, etc.

Theres currently a https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/cscsif/ web page hosting CSIF news, updated sporadically if at all. The page is wikiesque, but editable by CSIF Support CSIF employees. There is also a http://csifdocs.cs.ucdavis.edu/tikipage.php?pageNameCSIF+Loads page where you can see what the load averages are for most computers that make up the CSIF net (some are secret!).

CSIF received a glut of Dell flatscreen monitors sometime in 2006, which are now used alongside the old CRTs, giving many of the PCs dualmonitor capability.

A series of fancy photo prints now adorn all CSIF labs, giving the inhabitants a pleasant view of places they are not currently at.

The CSIF is administered by CSIF Support.


 Wireless Connectivity 
The CS Wireless Network was apparently only for grad students and employees. It has now been replaced by moobilenet. As of Fall 2010, moobilenet is available throughout the dungeon.

  Gone now. It seems that they sprayed the whole building that day. TusharRawat TR

20100304 16:10:59 nbsp Whoa, I have 200 pages of printing I did not know about? Users/hankim
 The print quota used to go backwards on occasion.... i.e. the more you printed, the larger your quota got. Fun times. Users/WilliamLewis
   Cannot be a coincidence that it happened in the computer science department. Users/hankim
