Urban Development Solutions
As posted on the Davis Police Department Facebook page (8/9/2013)

In June of 2013, and again in July of 2013, the Davis Police Department received complaints from two residents who appear to be victims of fraud. Both victims stated that an African American male, between the ages of 20 and 25 years old, standing between 5’6” and 5’8” tall with a slim build and dressed nicely came to their door as a solicitor wearing an ID badge around his neck. In each of the cases, the male stated that he was soliciting for Urban Development Solutions (UDS), a charitable organization that assists underprivileged youth. When the victims presented the male subject with their donations in the form of a check, they later discovered the amount of the check was altered to read a higher payment. In addition, the subject added his name to the check in order to obtain cash.

The Davis Police Department is asking anyone who may have contributed money to this organization to check their bank account to ensure the amount written is properly reflected on that check and that it has not been altered. If a community member feels as though they have been victimized, they are urged to contact the Davis Police Department or their local police department to report this crime.

The Davis Police Department would like to remind people to always ask for proper identification when a solicitor comes to the door. The City of Davis requires all doortodoor solicitors to obtain a City permit prior to walking through the community. If anyone feels uncomfortable with a solicitor, or they do not have the proper credentials, they are asked to contact the Davis Police Department.

Car Insurance Scam

In July 2012, the Davis Enterprise published a http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/caraccidentscamindavispolicedmvoffertipstoprotectyourself/ story about a reported car insurance scam that occurred in Davis.   In the story, a resident parked his car on the street while visiting a friend.  When leaving he was approached by a well dressed Asian man, approximately 40ish, accompanied by two females, who were driving a black van.  They accused the resident of damaging their car which had been parked in front of him earlier in the day.  They demanded $200 to repair the damage.  The resident claims he was pressured into paying them $185 on the spot, even though he felt like he had not damaged the car.

Fake Health Inspectors

On July 7th, 2011, the Davis Enterprise published a http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/yolocounty/foodworkerswarnedoffraudulentinspector/ story warning of fraudulent health inspectors operating in the area. The individual will call the business, claiming that there is an inspection scheduled the next day. Be aware that legitimate health inspectors will usually NOT announce an impending visit, nor will they collect money, or try to sell you anything. Yolo County Environmental Health may be contacted with any questions or to report suspicious activity at (530) 6668646

Stranded Neighbor

While people can easily be genuinely stranded (not everybody carries their credit card everywhere, and being broke doesnt mean you cant ask for help), the key thing that makes this a con is that the person does not actually intend to use the money they ask for to buy gas, a train ticket, or other way to get out of their predicament. Instead of simply asking for money, their falsehood in their circumstances and the intended use for your charity (and the implication that you can help them with one act and they will be okay) makes this a con. Charity is great and important, but charities that ask for money for a purpose and then use it for other reasons is bad, be it a large charity or a single person.

Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?vkrg5r6n0kr4 YouTube video of a news team following some panhandlers, including a “stranded” teenage girl. Some of these scamming panhandlers are relatively successful, estimated to earn up to $50/hr and may just be local kids/teenagers.

 Oakland Train Guy 
A nicely dressed, polite AfricanAmerican man in his twenties or thirties approaches people telling a story of how he came to Davis for a workshop but got stranded here when his car broke down.  He supposedly needs just a few dollars to make enough money to buy a train ticket back to Oakland.  He flashes a drivers license to prove hes from Oakland, making the story sound legitimate.  Hes been seen on E Street on the sidewalk by the Orange Court.

 This guy stopped me on the street outside the G St. Pub on May 13 around 7:30pm. Tall, African American, and very friendly. He said he was stranded in Davis and needed a few bucks for a train back to Richmond (he showed me his drivers license too). That day, I was dressed like the average student, and it shouldve been pretty obvious that I didnt have money to be giving away to strangers. He wasnt stopping older professortypes who look like they actually have the money, and that made me suspicious. Just before this, I was also approached in the same spot by a Caucasian man asking for money for food, and when I pointed him toward Davis Community Meals, he got angry and walked away. I dont mean to say anything bad about G St., but it seems to attract a lot of scammers. Users/StephanieRobinson

 2/21/2013  The Oakland Train Guy stopped me and two friends today on 3rd street outside of the Social Sciences Building (the death star). He gave us the same story as others have described and said he needed $17 for the Amtrak ticket. Collectively, he got $15 from us. Afterwards, I had a weird feeling about it and was told by another friend that he is a seasoned con artist in Davis. I called UC police and the woman on the phone sounded very familiar with him and told me they have to run him off campus often. I am annoyed that we got duped and dont want him to get away with it with anyone else. Beware!!

20100601 11:03:56 nbsp Oakland Train Guy at it again on G Street and 2nd, Sunday 5/30 around 6pm Users/Byron

6/9/10 Train guy won again I saw a man give him $5 around 6:30 on 2nd st  makes me wonder why do I work so hard when I could just walk around and lie to people.

Encountered him today (July 12, 2010) by Orange Hut downtown around 6:30ish. I almost believed him, too.

Sometime in 05/2011  Looks like the guy is back.  Approached me in front of the Art Building on campus a few weeks ago.  users/jiml

March 2012 Hes still around, roaming the Silo area and Segundo North. Users/AlexTK

March 20, 2012: Approached me by the bus stop at Umall stating that his car broke down, and itll be in the shop for 2 more days. He needed to get to San Francisco by 4:30 and needed around ~$14 for an Amtrak ticket. Promised that if I helped him out he would help someone else out in return. I simply just said I didnt have cash on me (despite the crazy amount of groceries I just purchased) and he said, I understand and continued towards the ARC. Users/DeeptiNallapaneni

On March 20, 2012, I passed by the MU bus station and was approached by a well dressed black man who was over 6feet tall wearing sunglasses. He would probably be recognizable by his dreadlocks. He apologized profusely for stopping me and my friend and seemed very sincere in his plea for money to buy an Amtrak ticket to return to Stockton. He said he only needed $7 more. I only gave him $2 but now Im wondering if it was a scam. He shook my hand after I handed him the money. This was around 2PM. Users/catd

June 2, 2013: Approached by the same story that DeeptiNallapaneni had. At 12:00pm, African American guy walks up to me and my boyfriend at the Amtrak station, said his car broke down and he needed just $13 more dollars to get to San Francisco by 4:30pm. Helped him out by giving him $10. He promised that if I helped him out he would help someone else in return. Then he left, and we didnt see him get on the train. Users/candices

Fake Fundraiser Con
Weve all experienced those doortodoor fundraisers.  Elementary school kids sell candy, wrapping paper, or magazine subscriptions.  Shadier, pushier teens and adults sell candy bars for $5 apiece to supposedly raise money for leadership training, summer camp, and what have you.  Not surprisingly, these arent always legitimate.  While you shouldnt necessarily call the cops on your neighbors 4th grader, exercise caution.  If youre suspicious, its probably for good reason.

As of May 2011 students going doortodoor are asking for money for music programs.  An http://wwwnew.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/ucdwarnsoffundraisingscam/ article in The Enterprise reports that UC Davis and Sacramento State are warning people that no universityaffiliated music program is doing anything of the sort.  Chances are the con artists will be happy to switch their story up, so just because theyre not claiming to be collecting for a music program doesnt mean you should let your guard down.

If you get a visit from these characters, contact the Davis Police Department.  If you want to verify the legitimacy of fundraisers who come by, call the University Development Office at (530) 7544438, or look up the phone number for whatever other organization they claim to represent.  If youre suspicious but want to donate to the organization, contact the organization on your own and arrange to make a donation without going through a shady intermediary.

   Annually (the last three years running) people have come to my door selling magazines to raise money for something or other.  This last year, my roomate purchased two one year subscriptions that were supposed to come with bonus prizes, and totaled about $150.  Nothing has ever shown up.  users/masonmurray MM
   (As of 04172012): I was said roommate, confirm that magazines never showed up. Some research on the company they claimed to work for revealed nationallevel shadiness. Sure, people shouldnt be stupid and order from these people but folks should really be talking about this more. By the way, they are back again. Theyre in East Davis as I write and I reported them to the police. For those who havent met one of them, theyre a group of 20somethings, usually rather hyperactive (tweakerish), smell like smokers, claim to be in a public speaking thingamajig with a boysvsgirls contest as to win some sort of trip. Theyll pull out a rather wellused sheet of magazines and start taking your info down. The second you say anything about not being able to pay they lose interest and leave very quickly. If one comes to your door you can ask to see their permit. If they dont have it its an obvious scam and you should report them to the police immediately. users/kbathory KB
     Same. They were always collegeaged kids who wanted to sell me crap so they can win some dumb trip or something. Didnt buy anything from them because they sort of gave off this spoiled brat attitude. Wouldnt be surprised if they were conning people. Guess Im only buying Girl Scout cookies now. Users/hankim

Interested RoomSeeker Con


This usually happens when someone leaves a posting online for a room that is available for rent. The con artist usually poses as a foreign student and contacts the poster about being interested in the room and then sends a check that is a certain amount over the requested amount for deposit, first months rent, or any other possible costs involved in adding oneself to a lease. Then the con artist contacts the poster and asks for the extra money to be wired back (before the check bounces) in order to purchase plane tickets. Once the poster wires the money, the poster is out at least a thousand dollars or so. So those with an available room for rent, make sure the check clears before wiring money to anyone. But a cleared check does not put you completely in the clear. Banks are required by law to make funds available within a few days but it might take weeks before the issuers bank processes and clears the check. Before the check is cleared by the issuers bank, your bank is basically loaning you the money.
  This goes on with selling used cars and the like, as well.  Its also common for these people to call the number for a posting using a hearing assisted phone service, where theres an intermediary supposedly translating everything.  No idea why... but my brother got two different calls like this when he was selling his car on the Bay Area Craigslist, both of them offering to send a check for a couple grand over asking price, letting him refund the difference.  I have no idea why anyone would agree to this, but regardless, something to watch out for. Users/TomGarberson
    Its a very common scam on Craigslist.  If you sell something expensive on there, you will likely get a lot of scam emails sent to you.  Some may even be automated.  Users/IDoNotExist
  Dont think that a cleared check will stop the bank from taking the money from you.  They can up to 3 months after the check is cashed.  Users/jimstewart

Cheap Housing Con
High housing turnover and people looking to live cheaply will sometimes lead to a scam where someone posts a bogus house on craigslist or similar, and then charges some kind of viewing fee or advance deposit. Usually the houses involved in this are recently put on the market for sale, which is where the con finds the info. In order to avoid, google the address and see if the house has recently been on the market. Also, as always, if its too good to be true, it probably is!

Returning Merchandise
Anyone been asked to return something for a guy outside Target, or maybe elsewhere? Target requires an ID to return something without the receipt to keep track of how many times you do this to catch shoplifters. This guy claims he lost the receipt and forgot his ID at home (out of town) and needs to return some expensive razor blades...

Free Music Speakers
Who doesnt love free stuff?  Well thats what these two shady characters are counting on when they drive around and offer you a free set of music speakers.  The story is they just remodeled a house and they have these speakers left over, and you can have em.  The men are both caucasian, in their late 20s or early 30s, one with black hair, one with reddish blonde hair and, if I recall, a goatee.  They drive a late model black Ford Explorer or Expedition with Florida license plates.  I have been solicited by them three times in the last couple years: first in front of the South Davis Safeway, then at the Shell station/InNOut parking lot, and most recently in The Marketplace parking lot.

The most recent time, I was loading groceries in my car when they pulled up, the blonde passenger rolled down his window, and asked me if I wanted free speakers.  I told him I wasnt interested.  He kept offering until I told him they had approached me in the past.  The man paused and said, and what happened?  I replied, I dont know, whats supposed to happen? and he said I dunno, its supposed to be fun and directed his friend to move on and go to a different part of the lot.  Users/ClarkVineyard

Thanks Davis Wiki! Got approached by these two guys today (they approached me near Bank of America as I was getting into my car and they were on the street (with cars behind them). I guess they thought I was a great target as I was wearing a tshirt with a bunch of boomboxes on it. Unbeknownst to them, I already read about their little game.  Users/AlvinTsao

  This is the old wiki:Wikipedia:White van speaker scam.  Like most scams, its been around for years.  I remember walking to lunch with a friend of mine in Berkeley about 20 years ago.  We were stopped by guys in a real white van and they tried to sell us their speakers.  We sent them to Meyers Sound just down the street.  Told them that lots of hippie musicians worked there and would probably all be interested in their speakers. Its also common for wisedup victims to perpetuate the scam by selling their overpriced speakers on Craigslist for what they paid for them.  users/jimstewart

   Update May 30, 2011. Two guys in their 20s talked to me from their car on Russel. Pulled over, saw the speakers, they opened the box for me, followed me downtown to WellsFargo, where I withdrew $200. Took one last look at speakers, and typed brand and model number into my iPhone. Google pulls up pages of fraud alerts. Told the guys no deal, and took a photo of their vehicle as they left.
    Looks like you whited out the plate. The speaker scam is an oldie but a goodie. Report it... especially since you can connect a vehicle Daubert
    Didnt white out the license plate, but was actually trying to photograph it. I was just a bit nervous I guess, thus the crappy image. The talker had short light blondish hair, light complexion. The guy in the passenger seat, was pale had some facial piercings, and didnt talk very much. previous poster
  I dont get it. Whats the scam? They offer you free speakers, then you take them...and then what? Or do they expect you to go over to their house to pick them up, and then kidnap you or something? Users/TheShah
   I think they sell you crap speakers that are broken or very low quality for the price of new/good quality. Users/jsbmeb
    Well, thats how the scam usually works. These people are claiming the speakers are free. Thats a new wrinkle. I wonder how they get your money in this iteration of the scam. Users/WilliamLewis
      The scam I was subjected to, is that the box and website show an MSRP for something like $2,500 USD, and here you have two guys offering to let go of them for say $500 bucks. So even if you argue them down to $200 you think you are getting some incredible deal, but it turns out the speakers are worth about $50, and they possibly might not even work. I believe that this is an actual marketing campaign, but just a couple of dudes, but an entire army across the US, that work for this company. They probably buy the systems cheap, and then market them off in this manner. Pure speculation on my part, BTW.

Sale of Stolen Bikes
With the abundance of bikes in the City of Davis, bike theft is an unfortunately common occurrence in town.   Occasionally, stolen bikes may turn up for sale on sites like http://sacramento.craigslist.org/ Craigslist.  A particular case was documented on the http://daviswiki.org/Bike_Recovery_System#biketheft Bike Recovery System page.

PG&E Lights Out Scam

This seems to be happening frequently in Davis as of https://local.nixle.com/alert/5180159/ April 2014

A person claiming to be from PG&E will give you a call claiming that your power is going to be shut off within the next 2 or 3 hours unless you pay them the balance you owe. When you claim to have made payment, they tell you there was a problem processing it. They are often very pushy and say that you must pay using a http://www.moneypak.com MoneyPak card in order to stop your power from being shut off. This can be devastating to people who depend on power for health or other reasons. DO NOT be fooled! PG&E will never call you via a human call to collect money, they instead have a machine that calls you and asks for you to call them. Also they will not shut your power off until they have sent out a 14 day and 7 day notice. They will also have a machine call you to tell you that your power is going to be shut off and to call them.

To prevent being victim of this scam tell the person that you will call PG&E directly to pay any outstanding balance that might exist. Their number is (800)7435000 for residential and (800)4684743 for business. Never give out any information unless you are calling PG&E and know who you are talking to.

There are other http://www.pgecurrents.com/2014/03/21/pgewarnscustomersofseveralongoingscams/ PG&E scams. As long as you remember to never give any information to a PG&E representative that calls you, then you should be fine. Never be afraid to hang up on these people and call PG&E directly.


Strategies to help honest people

20100322 13:53:53 nbsp I have found that the easiest way to tell if these people are legit is to offer them the specific help they ask for.  If they say they need money for a train ticket, I offer to buy them a train ticket.  If they say they need money for gas, I offer to pay for their gas.  If they say they need money for food because they are starving, when I am coming out of the grocery store, I offer them a loaf of bread.  They usually get indignant and try to come up with some lame excuse of why that wont help them.  One guy who claimed to be starving actually turned down a loaf of bread.  Anyway, in all of the time I have used this approach, I have only come across one person in need of what they were asking for. Users/DavidGrundler

  That actually sounds like a great idea. Amazing how rarely we think of the simplest solutions...  Users/WesOne
   You would think, but its not fool proof.  A friend of mine is a manager at a local fast food restaraunt and there is often a homeless person out front with a cup for change.  According to this friend he will accept food, then promptly throw it away.   Users/masonmurray MM
  It is a great idea.  And I once bought a drink, sandwich, and chips for a guy hanging out at a grocery store, asking for money.  Although he no doubt would have preferred the money, he did seem grateful for the food.  cp
  Absolutely a great idea, when you are able to follow through on the offer.  users/edwins ES
  Yeah David, that seems like a solid approach, it was the one I came up with using the power of hindsight, but alas you have the same idea... Daubert
  I gave out shampoos and snacks I got for Bounty and Savings free at the stores (easy, theyre stationed right outside!) and they appreciated it  LY
  This is a good strategy, or another good one is to give to a legitimate charity and then direct them to that charity. A fun one I learned from a friend is to buy McDonalds gift certificates (you can get them for $1) and give them out, or something similar. Also, I like to carry around dog treats in places where there are lots of homeless dogs. People seem really surprised when you hand them a dog treat, and the dog is definitely happy. From living in the middle of an enormous city for years, I make it a rule not to believe the stories that anyone tells me who randomly approaches me on the street, but Ive noticed that in Davis it happens so rarely that people are frequently caught off guard. Dont worry about what happens if you dont help someone whose story you are unsure aboutthere are PLENTY of community resources and plenty of other people who they will ask after you.

20100608 16:23:24 nbsp About two weeks before Memorial Day, I got hit up by a short, lightskinned Hispanic guy claiming to be on leave from the Army and trying to buy a train ticket home to visit his family.  He seemed pretty legit, but you never know.  Anyone else bump into him? Users/AdamV

He looks like hes in his early 20s shows a binder with a beat up looking certificate of admission to SJ State and some slips from my neighbors with emails and donations listed.  Same thing happened a year ago at my old apartment some guy saying he got into SJ State.  Just had another guy knock on my door while writing this doing the same thing, they definitely dont look like high school students.  Anyone else seen these guys?  Seems suspicious to me. Users/AnthonyL
  I think I saw a African American guy go around door to door doing the same thing trying to sell newspaper or something, I wasnt sure if it was a scam or not. So I turned him away, especially since he had no catalog or anything, not even a sample paper. Users/ClarenceL

  This guy just came to my apartment doing the exact same thing. Ive turned people with the magazinesubscription type deal away before but I thought this guy was legit and felt like doing a nice thing. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS KID. Runnitarian

  Ive seen both! Whats even worse is that Ive given money to both! The Black guy came first. He was really nice and chatty, showing me the binder and the San Jose certificate. So I gave him 20 bucks. Several months later another guy (Hispanic) came around with the same story. Because Im an idiot I thought it was some real program, I donated. After I gave the second time, something felt really fishy. He asked me to respond to an email that would come to me. I had to click to link so he would get his point for money for school. I asked him how he was sure I was going to get the email. He laughed and said with a smile Oh you will. Dont worry. No email, but then again, I kind of knew it wouldt after he said that.
Total scam. Also, colleges dont give out the fancy entrance diploma/entrance letter. You get the diploma AFTER you go to school and spend thousands of dollars.  Users/farfelu5251

  Me too.  One came to my house and another stopped me at Nugget.  I gave the 1st one money.  They were selling Davis Enterprise subscriptions which never showed up.  when I call the Enterprise, they never heard of this and I then knew Id been scammed.  I demanded my money back from the one in front of Nugget, but he took off running. Users/Aaron.Curtin

  This has happened to me twice already, two different guys. Once was a few months ago, my husband answered the door. Second time was just this past Monday afternoon. The guy showed me a certificate of admission that was so worn and beat up I had a hard time reading it. He said the Davis Enterprise was nice enough to sponsor this program to help him pay for college. Then he kept telling me look at all of your neighbors that have given a donation and showing me a list of five or so emails from my neighbors. When I told him that I, too, was a poor student, he insisted just $5 maybe 5 or 6 times! This guy became desperate and annoying very quickly, it actually made me a bit nervous. Users/rachand1

 Same exact thing happened to me recently, AfricanAmerican male knocking on door and asking to donate by purchasing Enterprise newspapers for $10$20 to support his college education at SJSU. He had a beatup binder with a wrinkled diploma, emails of my neighbors that also donated (all were ucdavis.edu emails). He said he was only going to be around this week asking for donations, which is obviously a lie since the first person who reported this was in January 2011. I did not donate, but he insisted that I just donate a few dollars, etc. Yeah, no thanks, cant fool me. Oct.4, 2011.  Users/lovelovelove3

 The hispanic guy was going around my apartment (September 10, 2011) and I opened the door for him. Definitely did not look like he was in high school. But anyways I ended up writing a check out to Chris Johnson... not sure if thats his name or some other persons but hopefully it will come in handy for someone else. I wrote him a check because there was another person the previous school year who was trying to get people to subscribe for Enterprise newspapers in front of Safeway... and I actually got the newspapers. So that guy was legit, but this other person not so much. Users/AW

 I encountered a hispanic guy in my apartment complex (December 4, 2011). He claimed to be a senior graduating from Davis Senior High School I was initially thought that his story was true until I went to the Wiki. He claimed he just got accepted into UCLA. Let me point out that the UC App is due November 30 each year. There is no way he could have gotten accepted 4 days after the due date. He also gave me this ragged old binder to look at while giving me his speech. I didnt pay much attention to it but he told me to flip to the red page in the back. He told me that the Davis Enterprise will give him some money if he gets 15 people to sign up for a subscription. His speech sounds scripted, obviously not his first time, but polite.


20110201 00:29:25 nbsp On Monday, Jan. 31, 2011, around 10:15 p.m., two white males in their early to mid 20s with short hair were asking for gas money from customers pumping fuel at the Chevron station at 1601 Research Park Drive (next to KFC, south of the I80 Richards Ave. exit). They looked quite a bit like another pair of guys doing the same thing a couple weeks prior, at the same station. It was funny that they solicited everyone but me this night, perhaps that they recognized the guy who offered them $5 last time. They were driving a newish white Dodge Charger with license plate 6CLC671. One was wearing red basketball shorts and a white Tshirt. Another customer said that they tried to sell a gift card to him. One even tried to sound desperate and ask for someones floor change.

20111215 15:47:42 nbsp I live in West Davis and have had to two people come by selling magazines this week after dark. Even if they really are selling magazines I think it still counts as a scam. Also, I think you need special permits to go door to door selling stuff in this town. They were both rude and became angry with me when I told them that I would not be giving them money and one of them insinuated that I wasnt donating because Im a racist. My roommate thought it was funny but I think its disturbing when people come by at night asking for money and getting mad. Users/MikeyCrews
 I dont think you need a permit to sell door to door. Ive never heard of such an ordinance. If you are caucasian and he is black, he was probably upset about the fact that his ancestors were enslaved wereas yours werent, which would make many people understandably bitter. It does indeed suck to be doomed to a life of poverty because of racial oppression.  Users/ScottMeehleib

 Davis City Code Ordinance 1972.... Requiring registration and permitting of all peddlers, solicitors and transient vendors will assist in protecting the public against persons of criminal habits or tendencies representing themselves as peddlers, solicitors or transient vendors.

and it goes on to say Sec. 182. Uninvited entry prohibited.
The practice of going in and upon private residences or residential property in the city by solicitors, peddlers, hawkers, itinerant merchants and transient vendors of merchandise, not having been requested or invited to do so by the owner or occupant of such private residences, for the purpose of soliciting donations, contracts or services, orders for the sale of contracts, services, goods, wares or merchandise or for the purpose of disposing of, or peddling, or hawking the same, or any of them, is prohibited and declared to be a nuisance except as provided for in this chapter.... the chapter goes on to say that you need the permits and you cant do it after dark.

Your point about racism is barely worth responding to. To say that its justifiable to call someone racist because theyre a different race than you is racist itself. Also I dont think this is proper wikipage for discussing socioeconomic disparities. Users/MikeyCrews
   Thank you for your illustration of Davis legislation. I never called anyone racist; I was simply explaining possible motivations. Although I was lucky enough to be born white, I can understand why black people might be a bit upset with the hand theyve been dealt. They have mostly been fucked over in every socioeconomic aspect you can think of. And us homo sapiens are basically a species of indifferent apes. Its quite depressing to anybody who can transcend apelogic.Users/ScottMeehleib

20120126 19:19:40 nbsp Ran into a lady near the UMall ATMs.  She had a cart with a gallon of milk and asked for money.  She said she needed food for her children.  She looked like she needed the help, but I couldnt tell.  Anyone else?  Users/WaylandLee

20120306 01:45:18 nbsp Recently an African American man aggressively came up to me and shook my hand and gave me the old mycarisoutofgasmywifeandbabyareinthecar sob story, and asked me for money. His brother (whom I doubt is his actual brother, likely an accomplice) follows him around with a phone and gives a home and cell number, both of which I suspect are fake. He was hanging around the MU last time I saw him, dont know if hes still around. Users/AnthonySheu

  I recently was encountered by this same man a few weeks ago on September 2012. He didnt aggressively come up to me and shake my hand or anything, but gave the same old story. I bluntly and quickly told him no before he could even finish what he was saying. Users/MichelleNguyen

20130428 08:34:07 nbsp Has anyone else seen that black guy (early 40s) hanging around 3rd Street right off of campus trying to sell his music?  I see him walking between Pho King and the offcampus bookstore at least once a week trying to get people to buy one of his CDs.  He was pretty nice the first time we spoke but he immediately lost all interest as soon as I told him I didnt have any cash.  I didnt think much of it until I heard someone ask him to sing something, to which he replied Its techno.  It just seemed a little off to me.

I might have to dust off my CD player for the next time he approaches me.   Users/Darkfallin


20140422 14:21:18 nbsp The SJSU guy that goes from door to door was last seen here in North Davis on April 2014. He is a Hispanic guy that is about 55 or 56 around 180 pounds, and he has a white binder with 3 pages in it. He dresses like a guy who is into the urban fashion with a basketball cap(new era) and colorful shirt and shoes. He goes off and says there were neighbors who donated and pointed them out but it was complete bull since I saw him go to those doors he pointed at, and NO ONE answered. He will be very friendly to you and ask you for cash instead of sending it in, but once you deny him, you will see his true personality and how much of an idiot he is.

Please dont fall for his trap. I didnt because he seems fishy for me, and I can sense his scam miles ago. Tell your friends and neighbors. He has been doing this for a long time. Users/JohnsonCart
