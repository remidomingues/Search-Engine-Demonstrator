Concierge Medical Training offers CPR and First Aid Certification Courses with Concierge Service.

Why take a class with 30 students and one instructor? CMT limits CPR classes to no more than 10 students, and first aid classes to no more than 12, giving you the personal attention you need to really understand the material. And with 1:1 studenttomanikin ratios in CPR classes, you get more handson practice time, giving you more confidence in your skills when you leave the class.

They will come to you and teach the course YOU want in the location of YOUR choice at a time that is convenient for YOU. No more canceling plans because you have to finish that CPR recertification by the end of the month, and the course you need isnt being offered at a convenient time. And no more sitting through that 8hour class for the twentieth time because the review and challenge courses arent being offered this month!! Course segments can be taught in any combination, so if you just took adult CPR and found out that you need child and infant CPR, too, you dont have to retake the whole course, just the segments you need.

Courses can be scheduled with 15 days notice for as few as 1 to as many as 10 students. Payments are accepted through PayPal in advance  after scheduling a course with Megan, you will receive a PayPal invoice. You can pay online using any major credit or debit card.
