An engineering student competition team at UC Davis. A group of Engineering Students (majorly Civil Undergrads) participate in constructing a Concrete Canoe and taking it to a competition each year.  The Canoe is comprised completely out of concrete and reinforcement methods designed by the students each year.  The original purpose of the competition is to teach students the variability and capabilities of concrete.  The team develops lightweight concrete less dense than water which means that the final product will inherently float in water
