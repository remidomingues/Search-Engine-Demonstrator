When conehead meets Micheal Jackson; The spring of a 1993 Holmes Junior High School Holmes Jr High Pep rally unveiled the making of a South Davis dancing maniac!  Donning a conehead, bright yellow pants, and purple sunglasses, this lipsyncing dancing maniac became a fixture in the Holmes Jr high spirit rallies for his crazy antics to Queens Another one Bites the Dust.   The dancing coneheads early influences included the California Aggie marching banduh where one could have found across court action in the near bleachers the flailing arms and twisting high energy of a dancing star yet to be discovered! The Dancing conehead has also made his impressions on the infamous First Baptist Churchs New Years Eve Bash.
