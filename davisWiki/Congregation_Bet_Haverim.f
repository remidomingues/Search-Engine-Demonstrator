The name is Hebrew: &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. For those who cant read Hebrew, Bet Haverim should be pronounced bejt xAvajr\im (transcribed according to the wiki:WikiPedia:XSAMPA XSAMPA system).  Because this name is transliterated from another alphabet, Bet could also be spelled Beth, and Haverim could be spelled Chaverim, but the above spelling is what the congregation has selected.  The name means House of Friends implying the welcoming, inclusive character it wants to offer, and its origins as a gathering of Jewish friends before a congregation was formally started.

I would just say that the H should be pronounced like the ch in Bach, but Americans tend to pronounce that wrong too. The sound doesnt exist in English. Users/KenBloom
