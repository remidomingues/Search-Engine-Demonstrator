A dazzling array of Booya!

I have a ferocious apatite for all that is rad and a tendency to misspell everything.

Went to UC Davis UCD got my degree now I teach special ed.  I recently got into the JET program and I am leaving to Japan August 1st.

I have been a personal trainer at the ARC, an Outdoor guide and a swim instructor.  As much as I detest the term,
I am a foodie, and I love trying new food where I go, so most of my comments will/ have been about food.
