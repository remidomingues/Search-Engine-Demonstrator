20110930 07:31:58 nbsp Welcome to the wiki! Users/CovertProfessor

20111003 08:35:36 nbsp Glad to hear youre enjoying Davis so far!  I was interested to hear about the ways in which West Village was falling short on their promises.  Hopefully, theyll start to improve on those areas soon, especially in the light of feedback from people like you! Users/CovertProfessor

20111005 05:23:15 nbsp To create a new entry, just link to it or search for the title and when you follow the link, or on the search result page, simply click create a new page.  For instance, you could follow the link Occupy Davis and create an entry under that title.  Dont forget to link to it from appropriate entries so people can find it!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20111005 08:33:06 nbsp Glad to hear the movement is spreading.  JabberWokky pretty much explained how to create the new page  just click on the link for Occupy Davis that he made, and go from there!  If you need help with editing the page, I or others will be glad to help out. Users/CovertProfessor

20111005 19:03:14 nbsp The FB page for Occupy Davis says Friday, October 7 at 6:00pm, Davis Farmers Market.  Should the wiki go with that??  There could always be a march towards the bank area.
 Users/CovertProfessor

20111005 19:18:23 nbsp I was also thinking that would be a good plan. I think the thing on friday night is just a general assembly to get organised with supplies and discuss agenda. I guess suggestions will come out of that. Feel free to edit it with whatever is most current/relevant. Thanks for your help! Users/ConsciousConsumer

20111005 19:23:34 nbsp Sure, thanks for getting the ball rolling!! Users/CovertProfessor

20111005 19:27:42 nbsp I just tried to create the featured page but I suck at it, still figuring stuff out. Users/ConsciousConsumer

20111005 19:28:42 nbsp Heh... no worries, youll get it. Ill take a look and see if I can help. Users/CovertProfessor

20111006 21:54:55 nbsp I added Occupy Davis to the Activism page! Users/CovertProfessor

20111006 23:02:16 nbsp Nah, just the cleanup crew.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20111007 13:20:17 nbsp You should use your real name if youre heading up Occupy Davis. It would up your credibility tremendously. Users/ChristyMarsden

20111015 17:15:14 nbsp Thanks for posting  that Rolling Stones link Users/SueHjerpe

20111015 22:27:31 nbsp Those costs will get passed along to the consumer one way or another.  Either through higher food costs, forced gratuity or lower food quality. Thinking anything else is fantasy.   Users/OliviaY
  In most of Western Europe, you dont pay a tip.  The employees are paid a decent wage for working for restaurants.  The quality of the food is about the same or better than here.  In some countries, such as Italy, you pay a different fee instead of a tip.  That fee goes to the restaurant, not to the workers.  (The prices for food in Italy are MUCH lower than they are here, except in the tourist areas, where they are a little bit more expensive at current exchange rates.)  Where you do see some interesting differences are in charges for things like water (free in the US, but you must buy a bottle in most of Europe, which is environmentally horrible), and in the customer service, which ranges from not so great to truly terrible  but this varies significantly by country.   Users/IDoNotExist
    Considering how bad things have been in western europe I wouldnt exactly compare that hellhole to the rapidly developing hell here.  Unless you want faster free fall into total anarchy which hey, lets be bad guys!
  You get some attitude if youre a tourist but I would say that the attitude is hardly any better here by comparison. Water isnt free here, and I would argue that most people buy bottled water here or have it filtered (particularly in Davis with the quality of the water).
A study from a Cornell University professor concluded that consumers assessments of the quality of service correlate weakly to the amount they tip, relying more on superficial factors such as the attractiveness of the server or the amount of the bill.

20111016 19:38:06 nbsp I have been outside the country but its irrelevant.  Businesses will pass the cost on to the consumer so the servers might get a living wage, but youll be footing the bill.  Your comment made it sound like you expect the business to profit less for the benefit of servers and THAT will never happen. Users/OliviaY
  Its not irrelevant if youve seen it work, and that was my point. Why are you so pessimistic? What are your suggestions? Leave things as they are??

20111016 19:44:56 nbsp and who is going to enforce that? No thanks.  More government is never the answer and forcing people to do good by holding a gun to their heads is counterproductive. Users/OliviaY
 It doesnt require more government, just more effective government. Get rid of the oversized military.
  If all we do is raise minimum wage/enforce payment of a living wage that will result only in a pass along of the cost to consumer through one of the three ways I listed.  IF you want to keep food quality up and not see consumers pay for the cost increase, that would require more governing through fixed costs on how each business operates.  THAT is the very definition of more government.  (Military is a total tangent but I agree with you there.)
   Food quality is shit in this country anyway. High fuctose corn syrup in everything is evidence of that. The government needs to stop subsidising big business through paying medicaid to walmart workers (they intentionally pay their workers low enough so that they qualify), and sending U.S. factory jobs overseas under the guise of the USAID program. I want to hear some of your solutions? Because all youve done so far is criticize.

20111016 21:27:49 nbsp Im a libertarian.  My views on how to fix things are shouted down so I dont bother.  Food quality issues start and end with government.  Corn subsidies and the subsequent need for oil because of our government supported monoculture has jacked shit up across the board.   Users/OliviaY

20111016 21:37:38 nbsp Dont be afraid of voicing your opinion. They wont get shouted down if you are respectful. I actually prefer Libertarians to Republicans. Ron Paul makes a whole lot of sense. I just dont see how the poorest get taken care of. I really want to hear some of your ideas for a better United States. I dont align myself with any parties. Have you done the political compass? Users/ConsciousConsumer

20111018 20:12:35 nbsp I think federal minimum wage is a bad idea.  At the very least it should be a state by state issue.  Either way that should be the salary politicians make.  Im a big fan of that idea. Users/OliviaY

20111024 19:52:56 nbsp Ok, I made some small fixes and did some other cleanup on the page.  Glad to be able to help in this small way.  If there are things the protesters need  ways to donate money or materials  that would be good to include on the page, too. Users/CovertProfessor

20111026 15:36:08 nbsp I was wondering if you would be interested in doing an interview for an article I am writing on UC Davis West Village. While I applaud the project I am interested in getting an interview from an especially environmentally conscious student who can talk to some of the short comings of the project. We can conduct the interview online or in person. Let me know if you are interested.  Users/CatherineHawe

20111201 15:37:24 nbsp Thanks for posting on Occupy UC Davis. I like your comment about documentary showings. I dont have a laptop but have access to a projector.  Im an alumni helping out.  I think it might be better if you, as a student, could get access to a campus room with projector (much more likely to attract people to an indoor venue). If you know about copyright issues...we may have to ask permission to show some videos. Inside Job is an important one to share. I already showed Money Masters.  best, Derek....email at hiscomposty@yahoo.com

20111208 06:45:21 nbsp This is a quote from the Collected Works of Mahatma Ghandi “Why, of all places in Johannesburg, the Indian Location should be chosen for dumping down all the Kaffirs of the town passes my comprehension…the Town Council must withdraw the Kaffirs from the Location.” (Reference: CWMG, Vol I, pp. 244245) Ghandi found success in South Africa for Indians by stepping on Africans, so I dont think Ghandi is so great as people say.
