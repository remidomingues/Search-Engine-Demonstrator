On October 21, 2003, during UC Davis Gay Pride Week, the Davis College Republicans decided to come out as conservatives. This was the creation of Davis College Republicans DCR members Jon Otero and Michael Dugas. They felt that conservatives were a repressed minority on college campuses and that this date would be a good time to come out of the conservative closet. Unfortunately, this date was coincidentally located during Gay Pride Week, and accordingly to a key Davis College Republicans DCR member at the time, they had overlooked this fact when choosing the date of the event. Davis College Republicans DCR would have chosen a different date had they been aware of Gay Pride Week occurring when it didFootnote(Per a conversation between Paul Amnuaypayoat and George Andrews after the event.).

The event held on The Quad the quad during lunch hour was met with hordes of protesters from several communities. The LGBTRC had several signs; some read Conservatives molest our children, and another had a picture of Hitler that read Conservative like me. Users/DanMasiel Dan Masiel, Users/GonzaloEyzaguirre Gonzalo Eyzaguirre, Users/WillKaufman Will Kaufman, and Claire Bolding created the Nuclear Phallus on NeoConservative Justice (a seven foot tall red white and blue penis with a nuclear warhead) specifically for this joyous celebration of crass patriarchy. The Ku Klux Klown was out in full force burning flags and hopping on his pogo stick.

Months later The Daily Show on Comedy Central had a http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId112274&titleRightOutOfTheCloset segment on the ridiculousness of the event. UC Davis UCD students George Andrews of the Davis College Republicans DCR and Aldrich Tan of the LGBTRC were featured in the segment. Due to the widespread media that this “tongueincheek” event created, other College Republican/Conservative Clubs around the United States held similar rallies to “come out” as conservatives. UC Davis can proudly say that it was the pioneer in conservative comingout epidemic.

Heres a pic of the Phallus and Users/DanMasiel Dan. Unfortunately, its black and white, so you cant see the glorious, syphillitic, red and white striping on the shaft, the magnificently starry blueball, or the bright yellow, radioactive warhead...
