20140115 23:23:50 nbsp Thanks for your comment. Im not personally a hunter or a fan of it, but also dont feel like debating it with people who do hunt. So, maybe another page on the subject. But Duck Days is a great program and the Yolo Wildlife Basin is, IMO, primarily a conservation and education site.  Users/DonShor

20140611 13:14:10 nbsp Youre right, just saying windy, really windy or breezy is too subjective.  Wind speed is actually a nice quantifiable solution.  Thanks CO. Users/jefftolentino

20140611 16:43:37 nbsp Today actually seems windier to me.  Was getting blown around a little on my lunchtime walk.  I wonder where the wind gauge is.   Users/jefftolentino

20140611 16:47:02 nbsp The weather page I like is http://atm.ucdavis.edu/weather/ucdavisweatherclimatestation/ Users/JudithTruman

20140624 19:47:57 nbsp No worries.  Its a handy little thing.  Glad I could help. Users/JabberWokky

20140807 12:34:13 nbsp I really object to your deletion of Second Chance Rotweiller Rescues page: their shut down is among the biggest news stories about Davis & environs in the past week. Please revert the deletion ASAP. Give people a chance to add information about this {scandal, important issue, mischaracterized organization}  Im using the curly brackets to indicate that there are several possible interpretations of the situation. Users/DougWalter
  I cant see that a page is empty when you delete it. I imagine you dont read The Enterprise or The Bee, or didnt see that they both had stories mentioning that particular group. However, thats why it was worth having a page, so that Davis and environs can be wellrepresented on DavisWiki. Now, as you say, to fill it up with useful &/or interesting materials.
  Thank you for making the reversion and improving the page. As far as reading habits, of course, you should read whats of interest to you. I guess Im suggesting that a modicum of local news reading helps one be an excellent DavisWiki editor, but thats an opinion :^) Your mileage may vary, as we fogeys like to say.

20140807 12:38:55 nbsp Gah I knew I should have obscured the address! Users/ToddKaiser

20140814 10:21:27 nbsp There was another notice that they would be spraying last night, but I didnt spot them that time. Users/ToddKaiser
