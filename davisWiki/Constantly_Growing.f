Constantly Growing is a former Davis business that sold wiki:WikiPedia:hydroponics and related items. There are also stores in Diamond Springs and Fair Oaks. This would have been a great place to check out if you want to grow tomatoes or marijuana other things in your closet.


20080331 15:02:00 nbsp This place might be closing? Someone just posted an email to Freecycle, saying that their office is closing at 123 D St.  Users/ElleWeber

20080408 14:57:28 nbsp This place is definitely out of business, the banner is no longer there and the store is devoid of anything.  Theres still some signs and hydro brand ads in the garbage in the back lot.  Anyone know why they shut down?  Someone who has a Davis Enterprise account should search constantly growing and see if they reported anything on it, Im curious but lazy.. Users/JeffreyOropeza

20101109 19:30:45 nbsp You could call their other two stores and ask.  They are still in business... Only the Davis store closed. Users/JabberWokky

20101110 00:23:26 nbsp This business closed at the time when its building and the one next to it were being sold.  The business owner had no interest in purchasing the building.  Rental income from his tenancy was a selling point for a buyer.  But he left in a private way. Users/BruceHansen
