Im a fairly active user of this Recent Changes wiki. As an active user Id like to make sure that Im doing what I can to improve this wiki. If you can point out specific examples from my http://daviswiki.org/Users/JasonAller?actionuserinfo edit history and provide constructive criticism about how I could improve the process of Welcome to the Wiki welcoming new people to the wiki Id really like to hear it.

For instance I replace the default text on the top of new userpages with:

{{{
This editor can edit this entry and tell us a bit about themselves by clicking the Edit icon.
}}}

If there is a better way to word this Id be happy to change it.
