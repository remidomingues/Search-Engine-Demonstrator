Contra Dance is an old time community dance where couples face each other in long lines up and down the dance floor and dance with every other couple in the line.  Dances are done to live music, generally Celtic reels or jigs.

You DO NOT NEED A PARTNER to contra dance.  People in the contra dance community are very friendly and welcoming.  People of all ages, including children participate and we change partners after each dance.

You dont need to know how to dance!  Free lessons are offered to beginners one half hour preceding each dance.  Steps are simple, with emphasis on patterns rather than fancy footwork.  A caller gives cues during the dance alerting dancers to their next moves.  Dancing is easy to learn and beginners are always welcome.

The Sacramento Country Dance Society (SCDS) hosts contra dances in the greater Sacramento area.  We hold three dances each month.  In Davis, we have held dances on the third Friday of most months during the school year (Oct, Nov, and Jan  June); however, we are currently on hiatus while we look for a new dance hall.  There are also dances in Sacramento on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month at Coloma Community Center, 4623 T Street in Sacramento, and a number of Davis dancers carpool to those dances.

Donation for most dances is $10 for adults, $8 for full time students with ID, and $25 for families.  Dancing begins at 8PM with a 7:30PM beginner lesson.  For more information and a complete schedule of our dances, please visit our website at http://sactocds.org/.  A post on our Sacramento Country Dance Society Facebook group page is a good way to hook up on a carpool to Sacramento.
