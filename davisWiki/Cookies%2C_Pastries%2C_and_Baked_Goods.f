20080805 09:02:43 nbsp Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie in California is baked fresh everyday at the Davis Food Coop.  No one else comes close.  Users/dwlotter
 Their Muffins are also very good, but expensive. Their layered cakes near the ice creams are good deals, as you can cut them into 4 pieces $2.5 each, bring them to work, and they are bigger and better than the 23$ cakes you can buy on campus.

20090528 08:02:16 nbsp The Upper Crust Baking Co. are the hands down winner in the cookie department! They have THE MOST DELICIOUS Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Peanut Butter and Oatmeal Raisin cookies on Earth. Find them at the Davis Farmers Market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. YUM!

20090528 08:46:22 nbsp I am a big fan of the CoHo cookies, squares, and cakes.  They are less expensive than others around town, they are always fresh, and always tasty.  I like that they are always trying new things, and I like that the money goes to ASUCD. Users/CovertProfessor

They also dont use corn products in their food, which is fantastic because I am allergic to corn. I asked and they actually went back and checked: wheat flour. Best brownie Ive had in a while. Users/nutmeg
