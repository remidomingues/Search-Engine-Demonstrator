20120531 18:17:31 nbsp Just had my headlights reconditioned at Cooks Collision in Davis.  AMAZING job.  And, everyone was friendly, efficient, a great waiting room, they were fast.  And they washed/waxed my car when finished.  My headlights had been so bad that I avoided driving at night (too many years in the AZ desert). Now they truly look brand new. I would highly recommend them.

20130115 12:38:42 nbsp I went to Cooks Collision for a bumper replacement on my mini after being rearended. They not only did excellent work but provided great service. Their lobby is very nice if you need to wait there for anything. They dealt directly with the insurance and rental car agency for me.  I would highly recommend them!  Users/Kassie

20131220 11:30:23 nbsp I went to Cooks Collision today for a quote on a scrape on my bumper. Not only were they friendly and respectful, they took my car to the back to see if they could clean it up free of charge. They managed to buff what I thought might be several hundred dollars in repair out for free. The customer service was excellent and I highly recommend them! Definitely going back if I ever need auto body service again. Users/knick
