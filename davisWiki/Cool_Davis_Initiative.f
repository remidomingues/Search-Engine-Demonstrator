The Cool Davis Initiative is the brainchild of the Cool Davis Foundation, which works extensively with the City of Davis, local businesses, community organizations, and local residents to inspire and empower the Davis community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Launched in 2010, the Initiatives goal is to engage 75% of the community in pursuing a low carbon lifestyle within 5 years.

Party on Sunday, April 21, 2013 from 3:005:00 p.m. at Davis Community Church (412 C Street). The

Davis will present the 2013 Eco Hero Awards, followed by refreshments and party favors for all.

Kim Stanley Robinson: author and Sierra photographer

Davis resident Kim Stanley Robinson is a science fiction writer, whose “Mars” trilogy has been translated
into 23 languages. He has won the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards and was named a “Hero of the
Environment” by Time magazine in 2008. He is associated with the Sequoia Parks Foundation’s Artists in
the Back Country program, the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (UC Merced), and the Sierra Press.

For Children: An Adventure Outing with Nature’s Theater

Lyndsay Dawkins and Jeff Falyn created Nature’s Theater to connect kids to the joys of being outside.
The magic begins when Jeff or Lyndsay escorts the kids ages 410 outside. A character meets them, sets
up a story, and walks with the kids as the story offering playful activities, characters, and lessons about
nature progresses. If the weather is questionable, indoor nature crafts may be substituted.

Cool Davis Awards

Cool Davis will present the 2013 EcoHero awards to community members who model how to
incorporate sustainable practices into their civic and everyday lives and implement new ways to live
with a lower carbon footprint. In addition, we will present Climate Solution and Cool Davis awards.

Refreshments and Prizes

Birthday cake and Muirthemed snacks will be provided. We also offer party favors for all at the Cool
Davis table! Bring your own snack container for a chance to win a special prize.

Cool Davis will gladly accept birthday gifts to further Muir’s important work. Suggested donation $510.
