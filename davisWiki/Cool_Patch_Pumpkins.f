Contrary to popular belief, you dont have to go all the way to Woodland for a Woodland Corn Maze corn maze (You would once upon a simpler time have had to journey to Woodland for underwear too...but now that Target has cornered that market, Davis is becoming truly metropolitan)!

Cool Patch Pumpkins has been growing Pumpkins pumpkins since 1999, and started near Winters. Since then they have developed, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the worldâ€™s largest temporary corn maze. The 2007 maze covered 40 acres, so if it were perfectly square, that would mean about 1/4 of a mile one each side.  They have several different varieties of pumpkins, gourds and corn that they grow themselves. They are a small family business with the intent of providing a wonderful harvest seasonal experience for all ages.

The cost for the Corn Maze is $10 for adults, $8 children for 12 and under. Free for children 5 and under. The Hay ride is $3. They have picnic tables,  wagons to carry the pumpkins in as you pick them, and Big tricycles to rent and ride around the pumpkin patch.

Prices of pumpkins range from $1 to $40 (depending on size).

Due to high winds, the corn maze was cancelled in 2009.

See the Pumpkins page for more places to get pumpkins.

20111023 21:23:31 nbsp I went to the corn maze today. Many parts were flattened to the point that the experience really wasnt worth the money. It barely functions as a maze due the unintentional shortcuts found almost everywhere. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111025 09:04:09 nbsp We went on Sunday, too, and had the same disappointment as Scott. There was also a TON of trash in the maze, I was shocked at how much people were littering. Not worth $10 IMO, and they dont even have a student discount. It seems like thats how they make their money though, because we got two pumpkins and a gourd for only $12 total. Users/MeggoWaffle

20121016 12:11:33 nbsp I went with my girlfriend last week and went in 2010 as well. Both times weve had fun. It is worthwhile to note that the later you go, the more paths other people have created that sometimes lead to the exit...and sometimes dont.
The $10 entry fee does seem a little high, but we got 5 tiny pumpkins and 2 smaller sized pumpkins for $6 so we felt great about that.
Its definitely a do it once so you can say youve done it activity, but still fun! Users/omnipotentdude
