Cool as Folk is a radio show on KDVS that began in September 2003.  It features newfolk, oldfolk, weirdfolk, Americana, stringbands, bluegrass, and other folkish acoustic music. Every week, KDVS DJs host Users/MichaelLeahy Michael Leahy, brings musicians (who, coincidentally, will often play later that night at Delta of Venus or Sophias Thai Kitchen) onto the Media radio show for interviews and live performances. At last count, Cool As Folk has been host to well over 200 instudio guests. Past guests include Utah Phillips, Mason Jennings, Nina Nastasia, Josh Ritter, The Avett Brothers, Tom Brosseau, Brett Dennen and Jolie Holland. Jolie Holland was also a frequent guest DJ in 20042005 who went by DJ Euphoria Jackson. Michael used to refer to himself as Cornelius, but stopped this practice in the summer of 2005.

Michael has also been very active in the live music scene bringing touring artists to numerous venues around the Davis/Sacramento area. This concert series is often referred to Cool As Folk Presents....
