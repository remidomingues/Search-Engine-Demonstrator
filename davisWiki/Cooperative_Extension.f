The Cooperative Extension is the a way for academia to interact directly with with normal people, especially farmers.  Mandated by the fact that the University of California is a Land Grant University, the UC Davis http://www.ucanr.org Cooperative Extension works directly with agriculture and industry, offering educational programs in farm management, 4H, nutrition and family and consumer sciences throughout California.

Most (if not all) of the faculty who participate in the extension are under the College of Ag.  A few faculty are considered fulltime for the Extension and dont teach any courses, but most are also professors who teach at least a few courses.

Funding for all of the research the University does for the little guys comes from the wiki:WikiPedia:Extension_Service_of_the_USDA Extension Service of the USDA.
