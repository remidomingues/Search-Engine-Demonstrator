A housing cooperative is a legal mechanism for ownership of housing where residents either own individual shares (share capital coop) or have membership and occupancy rights in a notforprofit continuing Cooperatives cooperative (nonshare capital / group equity coop). Housing cooperatives are closely related to cohousing.

The Davis Cooperative Community Network maintains a https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkeydFZibnZBb3BwSUszaXFIOXRxcjVZdlE6MQ&ifq shared applicant pool for people interested in applying to a cooperative community (including cohousing), so they may be contacted by any cooperative community with openings.

Because Fraternities and Sororities dont practice voluntary & open http://www.davisfood.coop/whatis.html#principles membership, they arent usually regarded as cooperatives (http://www.justanswer.com/questions/cy96fraternityhousequalifyproperty for example). It is true that while they restrict membership, they are not discriminatory under California and Federal law.
