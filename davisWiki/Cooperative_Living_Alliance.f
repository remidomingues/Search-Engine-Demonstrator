The Cooperative Living Alliance, aka the CLA, was a UC Davis educational and social student organizations club formed in 2007, geared towards cooperation and the exploration of available coop living opportunities in Davis throughout the world. The purpose is to share and teach others what cooperative living is about. Also, CLA hopes to build networking resources with other diverse coops and nonprofit organizations. Membership is open to all people, students and nonstudents who are interested in cooperative living. There are no membership dues.

The CLA was founded by members of Pacifico Student Cooperative Housing with the intention of building relationships with the other Cooperative Housing Davis housing cooperatives.

 There is no evidence that this club is still in existence, either at the mailto or at the official SPAC list: http://spac.ucdavis.edu/studentorgs/AJAXsearch.cfm spac.ucdavis.edu.. Users/DougWalter
