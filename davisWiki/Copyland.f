Copyland is a small Copy Shops copy business on G Street between Sunrise Restaurant and the former Next G Wireless, across the street from Kathmandu Kitchen.  They have about four copy machines for public use but it looks as though they aim to serve businesses more than walkin customers.  They also carry a short list of about 15 course readers, which are generally less expensive than those from Davis Copy Shop.

This business accepts Davis Dollars community currency.


As a member of the faculty at UCD, I should add that Copyland offers a faster turnaround time for class readers, and that they are more willing to take on the labor of copying pages from books. Ive always been satisfied with their service, and with the quality of their readers.  Users/AndyJones Andy Jones

20061004 15:49:40 nbsp I got a reader from Copyland and it was decent.  I thought better than Navins for quality.  It was just missing a couple of pages.  Now at Navins, they will miss entire articles. Users/JoAnnaRich

20070129 11:19:37 nbsp I walked in for a last minute lamination job of 25 photos of various sizes and the store worker/owner did it for me while I waited. I had just come from Kinkos where they quoted me double the price, several hours longer, and much lower quality because their laminators get so hot. Copy Land is definately a better place to get lamination done. Users/JoRo

20070327 01:01:31 nbsp I am a faculty member and have been using Copyland for class readers and copies of colored, high res images for nearly 5 years. I have been very satisified with their service. They have reasonble pricing and a fast turn over time. They are also pleasant people to work with. C. Valverde Users/CarolineValverde

20070601 13:19:34 nbsp I havent used Navins much to compare, but Copyland is much better than Kinkos. They provide personalized service, high quality and low prices. Very recommended. Users/TomHinds

20080426 18:57:18 nbsp As an architecture intern who works on G street, i have had a lot of interaction with Copyland and many print centers in town. Copyland is extremely fast, and will often do work in front of you if there are not  many people around. They are also very knowledgeable and involved. On numerous occasions i have had complicated orders ie; large plots, books, flyers, and they will work through every detail to get it right, so that the quality is outstanding. The prices are reasonable, probably half of what you would pay at a typical consumer print shop (kinkos). They are able to do several kinds of binding including spiral, tape, and teeth.... to do perfect bind you have to go to sacramento. They have impressive plotters for a store of their size as well. They recently bought an amazing 44 inch wide path canon plotter that uses 12 different inks, and print quality from that thing cannot be beat... kinkos has a shitty HP printer, and i know this because i am a print nerd, and a bitch for quality. support Copyland, they deserve it. seriously.

20090102 10:42:50 nbsp I recommend this copy shop over any for professional work, for class readers and generally as an excellent business model.  The family that runs it is also quite terrific. Users/Lasan

20090115 21:41:55 nbsp Bought my first reader here today, and I have to say, prices are excellent.  Paid about half of what a reader with the same amount of pages cost me at Navins.  I would definetly take the extra 5 min walk again and pick up another reader here.  Of course, I would think it all depends on your prof, and the walk or drive theyre willing to take too, to save their students money.    Users/JimL

20090425 06:55:01 nbsp Copyland has always provided great service when we have needed personal or business copying (usually color). I can even email pdfs and they will copy them for pickup later! For your roundcornering needs, The Printer on Cowell Bl. has a machine. Users/ThePrinter

20090425 07:49:44 nbsp one time i needed copies and prints and kinkos/fedex wanted to charge me around 40 cents per sheet. ridiculous! then i came here and they had reasonable prices. definitely recommend it. Users/fakeplastictrees

20090507 13:16:11 nbsp just had a great experience here... needed to print a 4x3 poster. i walk in with a PDF on USB key and the guy gets up immediately from what hes doing to help me. 10 min and $3 later i walk out with my (black and white) poster. (note: color posters, no matter where you go are always orders of magnitude more expensive. in this case the cheapest color poster of this size would be $40)

ill be comin back here. support local businesses! Users/watson

20091015 15:01:48 nbsp simple, quick, easy. friendly and knowledge service. went in with a usb key to get some high quality color prints. 50 cents per sheet. amazing quality.  Users/MillaMi

20100212 14:47:22 nbsp Forget Fedex/Kinkos. This is the best copyshop in town. Doing all my color printing there. Users/stst

20100311 16:04:54 nbsp Copyland is by far the best copy shop in Davis. Friendly, lowest price and quick turnaround.  I needed 3 laminated 36 x 48s on short notice. Officemaxs price  $30/sheet.  Copylands price  $10/sheet.  Good quality, good price, good service.  Copyland forever!  Hurray! Users/DavisWheeler

20100507 09:09:38 nbsp I work for Adobe Apartments and get copies made here all of the time.  Not only is the price reasonable, the staff is so friendly and professional.  They work hard to make sure you get what you want, and will even let you see a sample before they print the rest of your order.  I am a very particular person, so this is extremely appreciated.  They produce copies even if you need them very last minute and finish them before your deadline. I am able to Email them what I need copied, and they make it look even more fabulous when its printed.  I am a perfectionist so its nice to work with people who are also perfectionists.

I highly recommend using Copyland for your personal or business needs.

THANKS YOU GUYS!

20100630 12:07:02 nbsp Ive used Copyland for ordering course readers for my classes a few times now, and am always pleased with them.  They have a fast turnaround time, and the prices they charge the students are a bit lower than other places in town.  Good quality.  Users/CatherineFung

20100703 14:27:07 nbsp Copyland is by far the best, most efficient copy shop in all of Davis.  I recently did business there and it was awesome.  Not only did I pick up about a 1,000 copies, it was ready the next day and the guy working their boxed it all up for me so that I wouldnt risk spilling them.  I would recommend Copyland to anyone and everone.   Users/sarah.kate.is

20110422 16:47:42 nbsp Best copy shop in Davis by far. Great prices and great service. Dont go anywhere else. Users/KarenEmbry

20110519 22:24:59 nbsp I needed several jobs done (thesis) on both 100% cotton and regular paper. While they didnt have the 100% cotton on hand, they did special order it for me to do the job.  One thing I should mention is that Im not sure how quick the usual turn around is because I always went in immediately after Id email the job and they would usually print it up for me while I waited a few minutes.   Users/Babhari

20111103 10:41:20 nbsp I went here because it is locally owned and had cheaper prices than Kinkos. I am so glad I did. Im so glad I did. Customer service was incredible. I got out of there fast, and saved a lot of money. This is the copy shop I will always use.  Users/las30

20120106 23:23:55 nbsp Copyland gives excellent services with very quick turn around time. I can count on Copyland to get my last minute projects out in time for the evening mail.  Users/LindaJConrad

20120107 14:38:32 nbsp Where else can you sit down at one of their computers and print something yourself or have them help you and only be charged for the copy? Users/BruceHansen

20120607 09:17:56 nbsp I love Copyland! Way better quality on their prints than Kinkos, and at a very reasonable price. Fast turnaround, and great customer service. Users/KianaFreitas

20120623 13:42:29 nbsp Copyland totally saved me today!! I needed some things printed doublesided and they got it done in a few mins. Also, I had some words that spilled onto a second page and looked weird, the guy did some magic on the computer and made them go back on the previous page where they belonged. Great work and I will definitely go back again and recommend them to anyone! Users/ElizabethWood

20130211 21:53:35 nbsp The people at Copyland are extremely friendly and accessible.  They are easy to work with and very efficient.  Also, Copylands pricing cannot be beat.  I have (several times) compared prices between Copyland and Kinkos and have always been amazed at how much Kinkos charges for things ($6 versus almost $30 in one case).  Highly recommended.   Users/EmyYo

20130503 20:32:27 nbsp Great costumer service and great quality! Came in to print some posters and color sheets and got exactly what I needed quickly and efficiently. Will definitely use for my future printing needs. Users/AnneElvin
