20090824 17:59:32 nbsp Staff try to be nice, but they make an incredible effort to extract the last penny they can out of your insurance and your pocket. Doctor covered a cavity on upper left side and damaged an old fill by scratching on the tooth right below when trying to match the bite. I was in great pain during a couple of days due to the lower tooth scratching (never had felt pain there before) and asked for an appointment to fix it. The receptionist asked me to come next day first thing in the morning. The doctor did not recognize she damaged the old fill by scratching it and charged me the full amount and $50 extra for the rush appointment. Finally, the last visit of the year for a regular cleaning was curiosly billed for exactly the full amount left in my insurance coverage and at a much higher price than regular ones.  General checkups, evaluations and other fees were added to match the total amount left in my coverage.  Users/Maga
