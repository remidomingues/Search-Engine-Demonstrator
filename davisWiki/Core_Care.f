An Apple authorized Apple Computer Macintosh service company. Core Care is run by the same people that brought you the Mac store on Arden Way... before the Apple Retail Store opened up the street in the Arden Fair Mall.


20070728 20:05:50 nbsp I needed a repair quote for an insurance claim on a MacBook Pro that took a spill. They were very fast and had the machine back to me the same day with a full quote. Great turnaround time, but as with all things Apple... youre going to pay a premium. Its cheaper than Apple Store for outofwarranty repairs, but remember, they have to pay Apple full price for parts, so dont expect to save half of what Apple quotes you. ChristopherPrice
