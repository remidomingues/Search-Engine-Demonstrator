My Name: Corey Pham
My Phone Number: Do you really want it? Get to know me first.
My Location of Residency: Greystone Apartments. I am actually worried about this because everyone who lives at Greystone and then eventually leaves has the worst stories about the management. My housemates and I are just too lazy to move all of our things out of our rooms.
My Personality: I have Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. I enjoy being orderly and overly neat. Family, Education, and Friends are the things that I value.
