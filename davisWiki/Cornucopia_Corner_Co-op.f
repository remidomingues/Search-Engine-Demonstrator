Whats coopping all about? Its a lot of hard work, but a lot of fun too. The coop is an 8 bedroom, 2 bath, 2 kitchen house, with a giant garden where a lawn would normally be. We share (mostly) vegetarian homecooked meals 4 nights a week, and each member is also responsible for a weekly chore and occasional work parties around the house and garden. We purchase bulk and staple foods as a group, and try to produce as much of our own food as possible in the garden. The house is fairly quiet, and usually peaceful, though we do frequently have dinner parties.

Brief History of Corner Coop:

On the corner of Third and J Streets, these structures house eight residents in a Cooperative Housing cooperative community. formally called Cornucopia Corner Cooperative and affectionately called the corner coop.  On August 2nd, 2010 SCHA moved two historic homes from 311 and 315 B St to 3rd and J where they have been retrofitted as a green, affordable cooperative.  See http://www.schadavis.org website for details. After the makeover, both houses are (August 2011) certified for occupancy as an 8bedroom cooperative; an http://schadavis.org/archives/1010 open coop was held on the afternoon of October 15, 2011.


Some history: on July 28, 2009 the City Council (acting as the Board of the Redevelopment Agency) accepted our proposal to develop the nowvacant lot on the corner of J and 3rd Str. See http://cityofdavis.org/housing/affordable/3rdandj.cfm the City of Davis RFP site for project documents. Habitat for Humanity Yolo County also submitted a proposal. Both organizations do very valuable work and can help advance the citys lowincome housing plans. The support of neighbors and the proximity to the existing J Street Coop may have lead Council members to recognize that this is a precious chance to meet the overwhelming demand for cooperative housing in Davis.

The Corner Coop received a complaint from the city in the late spring of 2012 over concerns of the weeds in the yard.  At the time the cornerists were at the tail end  of their land restoration project to prepare for home gardening.  The cover crop was a mix of rye grass, vetch and, clover (to fix nitrogen) with mustard to break up the soil after compaction from construction.

As of August 2012 the Corner Coop had a prolific yard with string beans, tomatoes, basil, eggplant, bell peppers, summer squash(including zucchini) , winter squash, melons and a collection of herbs.
