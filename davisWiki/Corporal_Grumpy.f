Its going to be very hard to get a picture of him, as he only comes out to harass innocent residents at night.

Name: Corporal Grumpy (AKA Paul Michaels, Dwayne Smith)

Phone Number: 9168701790 (Northern Cal securities)

Office: Greystone Silverstone apartments complex

Personality: Very grumpy and unnecessarily rude. He goes by many aliases. He is employed by Northern Cal securities. He seems to take pleasure in being as blatantly rude to Greystone residents as possible, and he has a power complex.  Generally, all you have to do is refuse to give him any information about yourself and shrug it off.  Hell get very upset and start demanding things of you which he has no legal right or authority to demand.  Users/SamanthaWagner Sam, Ben, and Users/KenjiYamada Kenji had a runin with him two years ago while they were having a grand ol time fighting with water guns in Users/SamanthaWagner Sams apartment.  This is where the name Corporal Grumpy originated.  A link to the story will be posted soon.

Around the same time, NAM TURK NxTx and some friends (Users/DeannaBrusco Deanna, Users/TaylorStreet Tay, and Users/MattJojola Matty) were hot tubbing in Greystone when he approached them and started threatening to report them to Student Judicial Affairs.  They laughed believing that Student Judicial Affairs has no authority outside of, well, SCHOOL FootNote(Although, if you are a student and caught, even offcampus, doing something truly heinous, SJA can take action against you).

A couple months ago, Users/SamanthaWagner Sam and NAM TURK NxTx had a second runin with him.  NAM TURK NxTx was waiting for Users/SamanthaWagner Sam in his truck in the Greystone parking lot when he was approached by Cpl. Grumpy. He rudely told NAM TURK NxTx to not block the circulation of the parking lot, though it was exactly what Cpl. Grumpy was doing since he had pulled along side NAM TURK NxTxs car. NAM TURK NxTx asked Well what the fuck are you doing? Thats when Cpl. Grumpy got really pissed and got out of his car and slipped in a feeble attempt to charge at NAM TURK NxTxs car. NAM TURK NxTx was then told to leave the premises and never to return, so he drove off around the corner and circled back to pick up his lovely girlfriend, Users/SamanthaWagner Sam. He picked her up and told her what had just gone down so they, together, approached Cpl. Grumpy. He asked Users/SamanthaWagner Sam if she lived there and then, in what apartment she lived.  She of course laughed and refused to answer, as both his demands and demeanor were ridiculous.

You will know if you come across him, because he is creepy looking and extremely rude.  Dont sweat it and dont give him any information about yourself.  Hes a security guard with a complex and he cant do anything...especially if youre not doing anything wrong in the first place!

20070830 12:44:29 nbsp Im so glad I found this. Our run in with Cpl. Grumpy was quite the experience. We were in the hot tub after hours and he came in threatening our academis careers as well!! We knew theres absolutely nothing he could do but left without argument because it would obvously be worthless. However, when we were leaving, we walked past his car (little 4door saturn reading Canine Unit Security along the sides) which contained a very irate, very intimidating, rottweiler. The back of the car was bouncing as the jumping dog was barking and pacing across the back seat. It was scary bacause it was such a small car which seemed to have a hard time controlling that dog. I felt bad for it. Animal Cruelty, I say. Users/nikki

20070830 12:54:52 nbsp May I ask why this is a public page and why this entry needs to exist in the first place, it looks like one large attack ad.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20090819 05:34:19 nbsp I had a runin with him a couple weeks ago, someone had parked in my spot for the hundreth time, so I decided to call the towing company, unfortuantly they require a lease with the parking space as proof.  I explained that I had the parking decal with the parking spot number on it and they said it was okay and they would come over to take a look.  That is, until Cpl. Grumpy got on the phone and adamantly explained to the towing company that Greystone parking decals didnt have the parking number on it, which is completely FALSE.  Clearly he is blind.  Anyway, so Cpl. Grumpy said to just park in the front area. I explain to him that the front is completely full, but the green employee only area is free and if it would be okay if I could just park there until the car moves, he says its all right so long as my car is moved before 6 a.m. So a couple hours later I come out and there is a notice on my car saying if I park there again I will be towed. WTF?!  The guy is truly an idiot and lacks anything resembling intelligence. Users/Lonestar07

20100720 23:31:30 nbsp Ive had several encounters with this guy, I wont be living at greystone anymore due to his over the top wannabe cop attitude. Its really common knowledge he just goes around harassing and intimidating people for no reason at all. DANGER!!! Stay away from him!!! Hell threaten your UCD degree and try to get you kicked out over NOTHING!!!!!

p.s. watch out he has a gun and an attack dog. what kind of apartment partol needs that????
