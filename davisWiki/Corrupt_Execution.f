Corrupt Execution is a destructionxcore/grindxcore Music Scene band made up of high school students Users/AlexNorris Alex Norris and Users/JohnDudek John Dudek and rotating members filling various other positions in the band. The group is now defunct, after Users/AlexNorris Norris left the band due to extreme laziness. One show was canceled and the band never had time to release any proper music, though their bootleg album Live at the 703 House is available through contact with Users/JohnDudek John and contains five live songs and a couple bonus unreleased demo tracks.
They have played one show at the 703 House, which is Users/TheRadish Radishs new house, with Prison Shank and Living in Disguise, and a show at On The Y, with The Naders, Planetary Ruin, and HoboKnife.
