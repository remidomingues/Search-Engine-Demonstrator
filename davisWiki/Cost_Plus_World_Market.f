Cost Plus World Market,  sometimes jokingly referred to as Cost More Third World Market, is a chain import store in Davis. They sell many different types of wine, some of which are really cheap. They also sell Ethnic Markets ethnic food, basic furnishings, dishes, and otherwise decorative kitsch.

They are the only store in town that sells the popular papasan chairs. The only other way to get these highlysoughtafter chairs in Davis is to search tiredly through Dumpster diving Dumpsters and garage sales.

They sell some of the spiciest hot sauce hot sauces in town.

This location was previously a grocery store called State Market. The building was originally occupied by a Safeway supermarket. The entrance to the supermarket was originally inside of the mall facing Starbucks.

 Controversies 

  Some question the authenticity of their products.
  Some question how worldly they actually are, pointing out that they contribute to the http://www.rainforestrelief.org/What_to_Avoid_and_Alternatives/Rainforest_Wood/What_to_Avoid_What_to_Choose/By_Company.html destruction of the rainforest.


20070628 15:33:44 nbsp Cost Plus is great  they have lots of fun foods, a great selection of affordable wines, and various things for the house, from plates and napkins to artwork and tables...you can pretty much find anything here  it may not be high quality, but its interesting and relatively inexpensive. Users/AcMach

20070822 16:58:06 nbsp definitely cost...plus though. Some of the prices are ridiculous! Users/ArianeMetz

20071203 12:10:12 nbsp I like Cost Plus, havent had any problems with em yet! I think their merchandise is very well priced and the quality is great as well!   Users/UNA1475

20071203 21:27:40 nbsp Very nicely furnished, and they have a ton of unique stuff. Though some stuff can be overpriced, some are really cheap. Stuffed animals were 50% off today! :D Users/EvelinaChang

20080319 16:33:36 nbsp I love Cost Plus! I go about every once a week for assorted goods. They have new sales every week or so. Some things are indeed overpriced, but all in all, its a great place to go. Users/VTang

20080528 21:45:00 nbsp sigh . . . can we just bulldoze this place and make a trader joes? swear. Users/chand3123k
  Even though Wold Market has nothing to do with Trader Joes Trader Joes moving into the UMall and nothing will be bulldozed for TJs, if that were really the case, Id say get rid of the Gottschalks over World Market any day. World Market is the best place to get European and Asian snacks and candy, and I really love going there. Users/SRB
  Gottschalks. Out of business. The radiology building. Bulldozed. Just sayin. Users/Flynn

20080602 19:12:30 nbsp Agree.  Would the papasans be missed that much if there was a TJ option here? Users/JamesWilk

20080701 16:57:14 nbsp I really love this place....prices are pretty cheap if you look for the deals....I bought stemless wine glasses for 1.99 while at target they were much much more per glass. I also bought a tv cabinet and a behind the couch long table...both were priced reasonably and not just look good but have had held up through some rather iffy apartment moves. Sure....a trader joes would be lovely....but why be pissy about having a place that mainly offers furnishings! Plus...there are few things I cant find at Nugget that trader joes offers. Users/sdlexie

20090303 11:38:43 nbsp Fun place and always an interesting selection of delicacies and flavors from around the world. One thing they need to fix is their patronizing and entirely arbitrary attitude to IDing customers. Ive seen them ID people who were probably there when California became a State and, a moment later, they dont ID someone who didnt look old enough to drive (because apparently the cashier knew this person). Another time they asked for my ID and the lady in front of me in the line asked why they didnt ID her: she was furious when the cashier suggested it was because she looked over 40! Users/Mazzle

20090608 19:10:26 nbsp I hereby predict that this store will go out of business within 8 months of Targets opening in Davis. Nonetheless, this is a great place to buy basic home necessities (especially kitchen stuff) if youre too lazy to drive to Woodland.  Users/jsogul
  April 2010  Still kicking. Two more months to go... As for home necessities, especially kitchen stuff, whats wrong with Ace Housewares?  Users/Flynn
  It has been brought to my attention (Sept. 2011) that this place is still open despite my prediction. Good for them! Great wine selection, cool stuff to decorate your house with if you have a budget for such things. Users/jsogul

20100121 20:51:12 nbsp two words  Cadbury Fingers!!!  Users/LeeY

20100222 22:02:40 nbsp world market has been having a way better beer (both singles/mixandmatch and 6packs) selection than they did a couple years back. unfortunately they cut back on their gourmet chocolate selection though, so i dont have anywhere to get michel cluizel locally anymore. spice jars are cheap here, and occasionally theyll put out ads with coupons for $5 off $25 and send out good email offers if youre on the list (including $10 for your birthday to spend on anything).    Users/MiranPark

20100411 19:52:57 nbsp One thing this place has is a great selection of candy and sodas. Some esoterica, but if you love REAL SUGAR in your drinkables, this is the place in Davis. I havent had Birch Beer in over a decade, and found some here. I may have actually said squee. Users/Flynn
  psst...Nugget has Birch Beer.....  Users/DonShor

20100412 06:57:38 nbsp I just discovered that they carry Virgils sodas...made with stevia and xylitol.  I thought it couldnt get any better than Zevia for my soda selection but I was wrong!  Sugar free and made with sweeteners that so far have no known bad side effects and plenty of good ones! Users/OliviaY
    Xylitols a sugar alcohol, our bodies dont digest these that great....As with most sugar alcohols, initial consumption can result in bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence, although generally rather less so than other sugar alcohols like sorbitol.  So far, things like Stevia and Splenda seem to be pretty good in comparison though!
     No we dont, but thats part of why they are low calorie sweeteners.  Plus xylitol is noncariogenic so its good for your teeth.
    Xylitol is also highly poisonous to household pets.  Just 3g (between 3 and 10 sticks of gum that use xylitol, for instance...) of the stuff is a fatal dose for a 65 pound dog, and itd only take a tiny fraction of that for a cat.
     Well you shouldnt be giving sodas to your pets!

20100611 21:57:25 nbsp Today I discovered that they sell the infamous bacon chocolate bar!  Users/MarioMeneses

20100701 12:33:06 nbsp Love this shop, come here often for my English sweets and sauces. Staff have always been very friendly and professional  Nancy, in particular, was very helpful when I had to exchange a large item of furniture. Users/LizA

20110216 11:46:44 nbsp I love World Market because I can find so many different food items there from different countries. I like the feel of the store as well, like the type of music they play and its an overall relaxing experience to shop there. the workers are very very kind and very helpful as well. The only issue i have are the prices, they are high, but it depends on what you are buying. Trader Joes being right next to it doesnt make it any better because they have lower prices at Trader Joes as well as international type foods.  Users/Sandlot3

20110328 19:39:16 nbsp I like the variety of different food and drinks you can get at Cost Plus (they have some especially cool different beers if you want to try something new), and I love their snacks/sweets sections because it had more than the typical chocolate bar or peanut butter cups. Ive also found some cheapbutnice kitchen/cookware here, and you cant go wrong with that.
However, I tend to avoid the rugs, couches, and furnituretype things, as they are a bit expensive, and dont seem to be very high quality.  Users/Morganna

20130322 23:44:37 nbsp Has World Market started gathering birthdates when people buy alcohol? A 50+ year old family member bought wine there this week, was asked for ID(?), and the clerk manually input the birthdate into the computer(!). Has anyone else experienced this?  Users/robinlaughlin
