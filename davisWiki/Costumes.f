 Making Costumes 
For simple sewing supplies, such as needle, thread, seam ripper, tomato pin cushions, and pins, Rite Aid has a good supply.  The Dollar Tree sells cheap packages of needles and pins, but the needles break easily.  The new Target has great supplies too, including magical fabric glue and even sells sewing machines.

Not having to make a costume from scratch is easier and less time consuming.  Thrift Stores Thrift Stores, such as  All Things Right And Relevant and SPCA Thrift Store, have cheap clothing. The Woodland WalMart (which is cheaper, but has less selection) and wiki:woodland:JoAnn Fabric also have good selections for fabric and crafts. The demands of advanced costuming can require a good deal of creativity.  For example, using innovative materials such as shelf liner or automotive floor mats.

There are a lot of Art art stores and miscellaneous supply stores like ACE Hardware to help make props.  A Better Place to Bead may help you make accessories, although JoAnns is generally cheaper if you can get there.
