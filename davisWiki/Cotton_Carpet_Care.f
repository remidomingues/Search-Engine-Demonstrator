20111028 09:19:01 nbsp After having cleaned our carpet ourselves several times with a rental carpet cleaning machine, we were thinking that its time to replace it.  But with winter around the corner we wanted to keep the old carpet until at least Spring.  So we decided to have a professional carpet cleaner come out and see if they could do any better in cleaning it than we had in the past.  Thanks to Cotton Carpet Care, our carpet looks and smells brand new.  Jim did a such a fabulous job that we wont need to replace it even in the Spring.  Next time it needs cleaning, we wont mess with renting a machine and doing it ourselves, well just call Cotton Carpet Care again.  We highly recommend them. Users/d&mHatton

20120126 15:26:07 nbsp We have been using Cotton for years and have never had a problem.  They are professionals, always take great care of the furniture, have never left a mess, and trust them to be in our house when we are not there.  They give solid advice on how to maintain carpets and how we can prolong the life of our carpet.  We find them to very reasonably priced and dont forsee us using anyone else. Users/LMWold

20120323 17:06:21 nbsp This is THE place to call to get your carpets clean.  I have a very, very light carpet, and over the last ten years, weve had over six cats, four rescue Labrador retrievers, teenagers and quite a few dinner parties.  Weve even had a few carpet emergencies.  Jim is THE BEST.  Carpets are clean and he is very trustworthy.  He and his wife Karen (who runs the office) are some of the nicest people youll find!

20120529 17:19:35 nbsp Leonard cleaned my carpet today as per my lease agreement.  He was very friendly, knowledgable, and explained what he was doing to the carpet before he did it.  The price was very reasonable and the carpets are ridiculously better looking now.  They are at least a couple shades lighter and he was even able to remove a really bad ash stain that occurred when the previous tenants spilled fireplace ash on the carpet.  I would definitely recommend Cotton Carpet Care.  I would use them again if I werent moving out of state. Users/LoriOrf

20120902 17:44:08 nbsp Cotton Care was really good! We figured our carpets were beyond the ability to get clean, but Cotton Carpet Care was really good and got rid of the majority of the major stains!  We were really impressed! The carpets look 5 million times better. Plus, Jim was very nice and extremely helpful! I highly recommend them for any carpet cleaning needs! Users/lolev

20130103 16:08:41 nbsp Our Housemates just moved out of the house we were renting and after reading some reviews here on Davis Wiki we decided to give this company a try. I was impressed. Jim Cotton showed up right on time and did a fantastic job cleaning our carpets. He was professional and was able to clean up our White carpets (even one which had kitty litter all over it). I would definitely recommend this service again. Great Job ! Users/brentgentner
