There was an Arcade called Timeout. It closed sometime in 2010. It replaced Fun and Games, which replaced Tilt.

A Cindys Cinnamon Rolls managed to stay open from the opening of the mall to very recently. It served fare much like Cinnabon.

A new General Manager was hired in May 2008 and the mall underwent many upgrades and opened some new stores. The Daily Democrat reported that tenancy increased to 85 percent, up from 55 percent in 2005.  In December 2005, the mall was purchased by Encinobased County Fair Fashion Mall LLC for $15.1 million. It was previously owned by Santa Anabased Triple Net Properties LLC. (Source: http://www.sacbee.com/content/community_news/yolo/story/13981716p14815402c.html Sac Bee 12/15/2005).

At many times this mall has been referred to as the Dirt Mall amongst local youth because of plants growing inside, with the dirt sometimes tracked around by kids.

A brand new Food Court was built, but a Sees Candy and a Debs Deli look to be the only businesses selling food these days.

The Target at this shopping center closed and moved to a new store at the Woodland Gateway retail center in July 2008. The old store was small and featured Target decor from the 80s. Burlington Coat Factory has taken the place of the 88,000 square foot former Target as of March 2009. Mervyns filed for bankruptcy and closed in late 2008. Washington Mutual was sold to JPMorgan Chase and was rebranded to Chase in March of 2009. Gottschalks filed for bankruptcy and was sold to liquidators and the store eventually closed, essentially cutting foot traffic in the mall down to basically nothing.

As of Fall, 2007, there is an alternative high school smack dab in the middle of the mall, courtesy of Einstein Education Center. Its funded, in part, by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  E^2^C served 150 students the first year (20072008), with a full capacity of 400 students at the end of the second year.  There have been fundraisers and benefit events, such as Sacramento Kings player http://www.mikebibbyinwoodland.com/index2.php Mike Bibby coming to a meet and greet.

The Mall bus stop is also a transfer point where you can take a Yolobus to get to the new Woodland Target, Best Buy, and Costco.


20060327 14:34:00 nbsp Right now is a good time to shop here. There are a lot of sales going on  I found the shoes I wanted at a decent price at, of all places, Mervyns. One store is planning to close for the summer and wants to clear out the inventory.

If you require the whole real mall experience  you know: no parking, too many people, a real food court  then try Arden Fair. We found County Fair Mall to be quiet and almost restful. And the pizza is pretty decent. users/JeffreyNonken

20060719 15:16:34 nbsp Good things: They have an orange julius which I love, a $3 photobooth and the amazing shiatsu massage chairs.  users/CatStarr

20070322 23:47:02 nbsp This is by far the most depressing mall I have ever been in. The ceiling is too low, the vacancies are prolific, and the remaining stores are mostly that kind of startup looking to fill an unexploited niche, usually with names like Bobs Shoehorn Shack.  users/JoePomidor

20070520 10:54:55 nbsp pretty lame excuse for a mall..i work here, and its depressing..seriously, what kind of mall closes at 7pm on a saturday night?! Users/DonaldJaye

20070527 14:27:38 nbsp The Washington Mutual has a drivethru ATM. In fact, that is the only ATM they have. You have to walk up to the Drive Up ATM if you have no car. Users/Jedron
  Just the same way you walk up to a normal ATM if you dont have a car?? You just cant please stupid people.  Just so were clear, i just called you stupid, stupid. Users/piratechef

20070705 17:32:39 nbsp added some stores, info about Target Users/PatrickSing

20071002 11:51:52 nbsp If you are looking for clothes at nonDavis prices, I recommend a trip to Woodland just so you can visit this mall.  I usually go into Citiwear, Sassy, and Target.  Oh yeah, and I got my bed here too (at Matthews Mattress) for a good price... I guess they have discontinued models, which translates to good savings. Users/CalamityJanie

20090504 16:17:56 nbsp a good place to shop for clothes if you cant go far. Users/thtly

20091130 11:57:19 nbsp I wrote a little script for a short movie called Ghost Mall. This place was the inspiration. When I was a kid I once saw a guy with a miniature zoos worth of exotic snakes showing them off to all the little chillins. They also had a pizza version of the pepsi challenge featuring all the Woodland pizza places. Now its a nice quiet place to study and feel lonely. Users/GreatRyan
