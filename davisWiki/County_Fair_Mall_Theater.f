Cinemark Movies 5 is a chain Movie Theaters theater like most (but see Varsity Theater Varsity, State Theater State, Tower Theater Tower and Crest Theater the Crest).  This five screen theater is at least cheaper than Davis or, indeed, anywhere. The now closed State Theater, which was also in Woodland, was about as cheap.  It is also the closest and most accessible theater if your movie isnt showing in Davis, and doesnt support the Sprawlorama that is Natomas or Vacaville shopping area.  It is accessible off the Yolobus 42 line, making it and the Tower Theater the two easiest out of town theaters to get to without a car.
