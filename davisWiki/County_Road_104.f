Mace Blvd. changes its name to County Road 104 as it extends south from Davis and through the Outskirts outskirts.  104 then continues running south towards Yolo County Grasslands Park.  After the park, 104 once again assumes the name Mace Blvd.  104 is one of the many Yolo County Roads.  Road 104 also has a short (2 mile) gravel section north of Davis from Road 28H north to Road 27.

Places to go or see on 104:
  Yolo County Grasslands Park
  Sod Farms, Sierra Sod and Supply
  Palace house (anyone have more info on this?)

20090622 14:40:56 nbsp We used to drive down this road to the archery range. We actually stopped by the Palace and Talked to a guy who turned out to be the owner. Its just his private residence (a dream house of sorts). Kinda cool what people can build with a lot of money.) Users/HannahCao
