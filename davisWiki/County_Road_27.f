County Road 27 is a County Roads county road which is a lot like Main Street in Woodland except its a few streets south and not actually located in Woodland. There is nothing on County Road 27, but it may offer a bypass if youre driving from Davis to the foreboding and ominous western or even the dreaded... Central Woodland. Get off Hwy 113 at Road 27 and take it west to County Road 98 or County Road 99 and then take one of these north into Woodland.
