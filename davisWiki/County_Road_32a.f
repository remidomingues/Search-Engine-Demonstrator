This road enters east Davis after paralling the north side of I80 through the Outskirts outskirts of town.  It enters town at an intersection with Mace Blvd, a location where one can also find an Arco AMPM Arco gas station and Ikedas Ikedas California Country Market.  A few miles east of Davis, 32a makes a sort of Uturn, crossing Interstate 80 I80, and returns to town under the new name, County Road 32b 32b.  Where it turns into County Road 32b 32b, one can find the Yolo Fruit Stand. County Road 32a is part of Yolo Countys County Roads County Road System.  2nd Street from Mace to L Street is an extension to this road that was renamed by the city.

Construction

During the June 2008 construction to improve bike paths on the road, bicyclist should be able to use the bike path that goes from where 32a crosses the train tracks.  This path ends at Olive Drive and has exits on and off Mace Blvd, but you access them from the North side ramps to I 80.

Update: County Road 32a was reopened on 7/14/08 and now has a nice shoulder bike lane on both sides...



20080602 05:42:48 nbsp 32A will be closed from Covell to road 105, June 9  July 14 2008.  I think theyre completely replacing it and making it safer for bikes.  Finally! Users/EdHenn

20080609 07:59:34 nbsp Anyone have an update on the road closure?  I rode my bike on it early this morning and it was still open and I did not see the signs that were previously posted.  The city website says June 4 Through July 16, and it is to widen the shoulder to 8 feet for bicycles. Users/BigGuy

20080609 08:46:47 nbsp The closure was postponed. It is now June 9 (today) to July 9. That is odd that there were no signs though. Users/JeremyOgul

20080609 11:01:42 nbsp I was on it at 5:30 am, so maybe it started after that.  Ill find out on the way home tonight...
