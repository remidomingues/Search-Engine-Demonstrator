As Chiles Road runs east from Davis towards the Outskirts outskirts of town, it changes its name to 32b.  32b then parallels the south side of Interstate 80 I80 for a few miles east, makes a sort of Uturn across I80, and comes back to Davis as County Road 32a 32a.  Before crossing I80 and becoming 32a, youll find the Yolo Fruit Stand. County Road 32b is part of Yolo Countys County Roads County Road System.
