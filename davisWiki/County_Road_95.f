County Road 95 is a major road not far west of Davis that runs north/south.  It is a part of Yolos County Roads county road system and is a great way to see some of the Outskirts outskirts of Davis.

The road begins at its south end at a juncture with Russell Boulevard west of Davis.  South past Russell, 95 adopts the name County Road 95a (but is initially unlabeled  just head south at that first likely intersection and youll be okay).  North of Russell, it continues all the way past County Road 31, past the Yolo County Airport, past County Road 29, past County Road 27, to an intersection with Highway 16 just east of the WattsWoodland Airport and just south of Monument Hill Memorial Park.
