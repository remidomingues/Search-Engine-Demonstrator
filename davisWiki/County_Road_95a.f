This road runs north/south just west of Davis.  If you take Russell Russell Blvd west from Davis, it will intersect with County Road 95.  Turning north will put you on 95, but turning south will put you on 95a.  Further south, just before it crosses Putah Creek, 95a intersects with Creeksedge Road.  95a crosses Putah Creek on Stevenson Bridge, a.k.a Graffiti Bridge.  After crossing the bridge, 95a becomes Stevenson Bridge Road and, after a few miles south, it ends at Sievers Road.

County Road 95a is a part of Yolos County Roads county road system and is a great way to see parts of the Outskirts outskirts of town.
