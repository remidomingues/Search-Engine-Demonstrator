20050623 11:36:04 nbsp Theres an elementary school on Rd. 96, just off of Russell called Fairfield School.  It is the home to a lovely green field, a childrens playhouse, a plastic and metal playstructure, a chicken coop, a sort of platform/stage with benches surrounding it, and some very nice trees to lie beneath.  My grandparents lived in a ranch house just down the street from it when I was growing up, so I spent a lot of time playing here. Users/KatieDelwiche
