The county road system connects the backend of Yolo County and is a great way to see the Outskirts outskirts of Davis and beyond.  County roads are an OK place to bicycling ride your bike. While the scenery is often good, and the traffic low (depending on the road), there is no bike lane and you might run the risk of being decapitated by farm equipment.  You might also be sprayed by a Crop Dusting crop duster (although the dusting shouldnt hurt you).  If you do go out exploring the Outskirts outskirts of town and the county roads, be sure to take a camera with you and bring back some photos for the wiki!

The numbering system for the County Roads works as follows:
  North/South roads have numbers from 83 to 117 and increase from west to east
  East/West roads have numbers from 1 to 38a (and randomly 152 and 155) and increase from north to south.
Integer Roads are one mile apart.  Letters increase from A to D.
