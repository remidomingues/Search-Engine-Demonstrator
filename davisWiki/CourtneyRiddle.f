Courtney Riddle is presently female, eighteen, and an unstudent. She has been living in Davis since the tender age of five, and cant bring herself to leave it quite yet. Eventually, she will relocate to San Francisco for education, but for the school year at hand, shes taking time off in favor of parttime jobs, video games, hibernation, and art. She works at Nina and Toms downtown store frequently.

Shes one of the towns few followers of wiki:wikipedia:Lolita fashion, and tries to organize/participate in meetups regularly. Do not be alarmed if you see a cluster of frilly girls descending upon the streets of downtown Davis!

Courtney is quite often bored. Youre free to say hello if you see her around!
