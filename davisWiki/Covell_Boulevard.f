Covell Boulevard (pronounced by longtime Davis residents as COvull, rather than the more common  coVELL)  is one of the main streets in Davis, Navigating Davis connecting West Davis, North Davis, and Covell Train Overpass over the Railroad Tracks train tracks to East Davis with addresses decreasing West to East. East of the tracks addresses are actually on East Covell Boulevard East Covell Boulevard and increase East.  It is the last Davis exit as you travel North on Highway 113, not to be confused with Cowell Boulevard in the south of the city.

Heading west, Covell turns into County Road 31 to Winters.  The large road becomes County Road 93A, and merges with Russell Boulevard including taking its name, even though the drivers dont change roads.  At Interstate 505 at the edge of Winters, it becomes Highway 128, which goes all the way to the coast, where it joins up with Highway 1 south of Mendocino. Its an absolutely gorgeous drive, and it takes a nice amount of time because of all the twists and turns.  This is the way to get to Lake Berryessa with its Glory Hole, and the several of the spectacular UC Nature Reserves UC Natural Reserves.

Heading East, Covell becomes Mace Boulevard by Harper Junior High School and Mace Ranch.

Covell is Covell vs. Cowell sometimes confused with Cowell Boulevard due to the similar spellings. It is rarely confused with Covell Place, due to the obscurity of this East Davis culdesac.

This road is often used as an example in pavement engineering courses (ECI 179) to illustrate the different types of cracking and stresses that may occur in flexible (asphalt) pavements.

20060514 17:53:27 nbsp Everyone drives 10+ miles under the speed limit and they never pay attention to what theyre doing but the rest of Davis is like that too. Users/BryonWright

20061025 13:00:35 nbsp We used to call the stretch between Monarch Lane and the Mace Overpass the Mace Curve or the Autobahn because there were no cross streets and no Speed limit signs.  Covell is the route most of us in South Davis took to get to Davis High School back in the olden days of the early Gay Nineties. Users/AdamFlowers
