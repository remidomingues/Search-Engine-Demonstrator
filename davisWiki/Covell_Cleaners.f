20080902 10:18:05 nbsp I absolutely love this place. They are a great business with friendly service and quality work. I recommend this to anyone who needs a change and would like to experience REAL dry cleaning!!! Users/hcapehart

20090805 13:39:38 nbsp I went here to have a bridesmaid dress altered.  The problem is that the seamstress is not on sight and will not see you in the item of clothing.  After they had the dress for a month and having to go back every week to try it on, the dress still doesnt fit properly.  The alterations that were done were expensive and done poorly.  It was very obvious the seamstress didnt care about the quality of work she was doing.  She damaged the material with too hot of an iron, sewed uneven seams, and didnt even clip her stitches.  I would suggest anywhere besides here to have alterations done. Users/MRJ

20100219 15:28:36 nbsp I had 2 shirts cleaned here which substained some minor damage.  They initially said that the cleaning did not cause the damage.  Then they said it was my faught becuase I had it laundered, not dry cleaned.  Then they said they did not clean them becuase they would have remembered cleaning them several months earlier.  I used them in the past but would not use them again or recomend them.  Users/davemcgrath

20131117 06:44:20 nbsp I took a few things to be cleaned here including a scarf that had been pretty badly stained. I also did pretty much exactly what you arent suppose to do and I waited a over a month before I was able to being the scarf in to be cleaned. (Basically I let the stains set in). I thought the customer service was really nice and they were honest that they didnt know if they would be able to get the stains out of my scarf. I told them to go ahead and try. While they werent able to get all the stains out the scarf was vastly improved when I got it back and Im still able to wear it thanks to what they were able to clean. Ive also had some business clothes cleaned here and Ive never had any issues. I thought they were nice, affordable, and my orders have always been completed on time.  Users/dds1372
