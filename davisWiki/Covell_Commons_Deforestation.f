April 11, 2007.  A program of Trees tree removal began at Covell Commons in late March 2007.  The Covell Commons Board authorized a local arborist to begin cutting down an unspecified number of trees throughout the complex.  The residents and homeowners were neither consulted nor informed of this program.  As of this date, more than a half dozen trees have been razed, most of them mature but completely healthy pine trees, with trunks more than two feet in diameter and crowns reaching to more than thirty feet.  No plausible reason has yet been given for this apparently arbitrary program of deforestation.  Evergreen Arborist employees told residents the cost of removal was approximately $3,000 per tree.  An outcry from the residents of Covell Commons has at least temporarily brought a halt to further cutting.  It was subsequently discovered that these trees had been cut down in violation of Davis Municipal Code/37.03.060 37.03.060 of the Davis Municipal Code.  The city has issued a cease and desist order to stop the arborist from cutting down any more trees.  A permit must be obtained from the city before any more trees may be cut down.

  20070412 16:18:42 nbsp Not ALL homeowners and residents have the time and opportunity to attend ALL board meetings.  This is a major change to the quality of life in the complex, and the tree removal plan should have been submitted to a general vote. Users/CWells
   20070412 16:24:30 nbsp I agree.  However, the Board is their representative body and makes decisions on such matters.  Looks like they will be facing the wrath of the city for violating municipal code... Users/DavidGrundler

There are a few central areas between units I didnt explore.  There are still lots and lots of mature trees there.   Users/EdHenn

20070504 21:42:00 nbsp Users/EdHenn Ed Henn and I went looking for the trees that had been cut down. The entire grounds of the complex looked well maintained and cared for and we had trouble locating tree trunks. We did find three, but I was impressed at the number and quality of trees that we saw during our search for trunks. Users/JasonAller
