The Covell Drainage Channel runs along the boundary of north and west Davis.  There appear to be two channels, A and B?, that ultimately flow into either the North Area Drainage Pond or the West Area Drainage Pond.  Both channels are marked on the Map Davis Bike Map.  Along the sides of the channel in North Davis runs the Covell Drainage Channel Trail, or the Channel Trail for short.

Someone with more knowledge of the topography and hydrology of Davis might do a better job on this page.

You can catch Crawdads in the channel that parallels the North Davis Fitness Trail or at least you could when I was young Users/StevenDaubert




If you pick up the Covell Drainage Channel Trail drainage channel trail on Sycamore and walk west behind Temescal Apartments Temescal and Chaparral Apartments Chaparral, youll reach the channel underpass (I guess thats what youd call it?) beneath Highway 113. The three passages are big enough to walk through (crouched over), but theyre dark, scary, and full of wasps wasps nests. Good to know if you need to cross 113 without anyone noticing?
