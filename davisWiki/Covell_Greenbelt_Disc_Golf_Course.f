The Davis Covell Greenbelt is a beautiful system of parkway that weaves through the neighborhoods of North Davis, CA.   Much of the greenbelt resembles a golf course fairway so there are naturally endless options for creating holes for disc golf.  The Covell Greenbelt Disc Golf Course was designed by a couple of greenbelt locals who wanted to create another way to enjoy this beautiful area of Davis.
Much like the UCD Frisbee Golf Course , this  course uses existing landmarks such as lamps, benches, trees, hills, and trash cans for its hole creation.  The majority of the holes end with bike path lamps to create the option of playing the course at night (though using a light colored disc and wearing a head lamp is recommended).  The best time to play the course is weekdays during normal business hours as this is when the greenbelt will be most empty.  With all the holes linked with bike paths, this course is perfect for using your bike as a golf cart. Check  it out and go enjoy the greenbelt !

Disc Golf is hard to say, the c and the g butt up against each other too close for comfortable utterance. Almost as hard as saying East Street. Or Shuz. (rhymes with buzz or ooze?) Why not call it Frisbee Golf, a much happier sounding appellation. Besides Disc Golf sounds more like a bureaucrat or marketeer coined it, whereas Frisbee Golf? I can imagine a kid just making it up for a game he just invented. SolidSender
   The sport term for it is a flying disc, not a frisbee.  Frisbee is the brand name of the WhamO produced flying disc, plus the people who are hard core into disc sports use different, higher quality flying discs.  Its a bit like asking why its called a Hamburger rather than just a McDonalds sandwich.  The most popular and well known brand may be Frisbee, but its still one companys brand.
