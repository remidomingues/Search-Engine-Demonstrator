There are 3 dog sculptures along the Covell Greenbelt.  The middle one is configured with a water nozzle that will spray a stream of water out when you touch a foot button near the dog.  In theory you could give your dog a drink with it.  Or get yourself wet if youre standing in the wrong place.

I was bicycling along the covell greenbelt a few weeks ago when I noticed these odd new additions to a section of the path. I know that my pictures are not that great so if someone can take better pictures of these statues, that would be awesome. I dont know why they were commissioned or who designed them.

They are, as are most works of dogs behaving like humans, thouroughly creepy.
