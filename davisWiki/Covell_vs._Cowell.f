Visitors and new arrivals in Davis may find Covell Boulevard Covell vs. Cowell Boulevard confusing. Users/WilliamLewis Some people still havent gotten it right after three years. To make things more confusing, both streets have their own Safeway, Dos Coyotes and Nugget.

  Covell Boulevard Covell (coVELL) is a long, straight street that runs east to west across North Davis.  (Old timers in Davis pronounce it COvul.)

  Cowell Boulevard Cowell (COWel) is a somewhat long snaking street that serves South Davis. As you take E Street from Downtown, E turns into Richards Boulevard, and then Richards turns into Cowell.

Two facts make matters more complex:

  Covell is split in two at the Covell Train Overpass overpass into West Covell Boulevard and East Covell Boulevard.

  There is also a culdesac off of L Street called Covell Place.
