The Cow Fountain is a Water Fountains Water Fountain and a piece of Town Art created by local artist Donna Billick in 1989 along with the The Dancing Pigs.  Both are located at The Marketplace, with this one in the northwest corner of the shopping center. This beautiful fountain revels in barnyard joy by simulating a pool being filled with cow and pig slobber.  People sometimes toss coins into the slobber and during Davis hot Weather summers people often sit with their bare feet in it.  This piece is not in the Citys public art collection.
