On June 7th, 2011, there was a cows cow in the dorms.  Woo!

Officer Ralph Nuno responded quickly to the devastating news that a cow had apparently somehow enrolled at UC Davis.  Or wandered in.  Or (most likely) an epic prank.  Its still kind of early for details  edit this entry and add what you know!
