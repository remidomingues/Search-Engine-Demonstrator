Little is known about the Cowboy Guy other than that he disregards all types of weather in perpetual favor of cowboy attire  pants, longsleeved shirt, pointed boots, hat, and vest. He is often seen ambling to the Davis Food Coop along East 8th Street. He has a certain swagger, and is always cheerful and polite.

Cowboy Guy is named Mark and he lives near the Coop.  Hes happy to sit and talk about his life, his take on the world and why hes so happy.  Hes one of the more genuine Davis Town Characters who enjoys all thats going on in Davis.  One of the nicest things about Mark, is how upbeat and positive he is.  He writes poems, one of which will be included on this page soon.  An updated photo is forthcoming.

Cowboy Mark has lived in Davis off and on since 1970.  He grew up near Tulsa, OK, and still has family there.  Today, Mark lives in a safe and sober living environment with others in Davis.  He enjoys various Davis parks but also William Land Park in Sacramento which has the Zoo. He enjoys ambling around, greeting people and sharing coffee time.

He has some good stories to tell and wants to post a new picture of himself for his friends.

20080930 11:49:55 nbsp One of my favorite characters in town. I tend to refer to him as the loping man because his swagger has a bit of drawl to it, a slow ambling gait with a hint of Im too sexynot sure how that equates with loping, but its the first word that comes to mind when I see him. Great guy, always smiling and cheerful to talk tothough Ive only ever had the briefest of exchanges...just pleasantries Nice day to be in the sun. Morning! etc.
