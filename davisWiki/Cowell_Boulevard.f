The Cowell/Covell Confusion

Cowell is Covell vs. Cowell often confused with north Davis Covell Boulevard Covell Blvd.  In fact, if youre in north Davis and a perplexed driver stops to ask you for directions, you can almost bet that theyve confused Cowell with Covell (an understandable mistake if instructions are written down and not spoken).  Easy enough to rectify: go east on Covell, continuing as it becomes Mace Boulevard Mace Blvd and crosses Interstate 80 I80.  Cowell will be the first intersecting street after the El Macero Shopping Center.

More on Henry Cowell http://www.schirmer.com/composers/cowell_bio.html here.  Does anyone have information about Cowells connection to Davis?  This article doesnt even mention Davis (Berkeley is the closest). Is it possible that this is the wrong Cowell?  Final questionare Cowell Boulevard and the Cowell Student Health Center named for the same person?
