On Monday, March 29, 2010, all services formerly provided at the Cowell Student Health Center have been relocated and are available at the UC Davis Student Health and Wellness Center. All phone numbers and contact remain the same.

Address(Cowell Student Health Center, 38.544400774146, 121.754181460087) (CSHC) did a pretty good job serving the healthcare needs of UC Davis students, considering its small facilities. The center provides basic healthcare, but offers neither Dentists dental nor Optometrists optometry services. However, it does have a very good website as well as MOObilenet and a pair of public access emacs in the lobby.

An Urgent Care visit will cost you $20 and normal visits will be $15. Tests are about $10, depending on what you need. If you buy the schools health insurance, generic prescriptions are $15 and brand name ones are $20.  They also sell a variety of other self care things such as bandaids, condoms, sun protection sunblock, etc. The student outreach portion of the health center is Health Education and Promotion, and among other things recommends that freshmen living in the dorms be vaccinated against meningitis.

If you are not sure whether you need to see a doctor, you can call the Advice Nurse. You do not need to be enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan universitys health insurance to do this, so even students who submitted a waiver can get advice from trained professionals.

The Cowell Student Health Center was built in 1952. It gets its name from the Cowell family of Santa Cruz  Cowell Health Centers are a traditional avenue of UC support by the Cowell family who has given generously to the university as far back as the early 1900s.



Ive generally had excellent doctors at Cowell, but last time I visited I saw a pain specialist who told me that my problems stemmed from the fact that I didnt understand that everything happens for a reason.  When I told him that I didnt believe that, he said, Well, why do things happen then?  Yeah, you really got me there, doctor.  Users/EllenWoodall
  You are just angry you couldnt get a medical weed card. hehe   Users/GeorgeLewis
   Or maybe im angry because the doc seemed to be taking full advantage of his...  Users/EllenWoodall

God, Insurance services is TERRIBLE. now I know insurance is a pain in the ASS but students have better things to do than goto the Insurance services more than they have too. I went once to fill out a retrorefferal and not only did the lady bitch at me for not using their doctors (what is this, a monopoly?) but I got a call from the doctors office a month in a half later saying they still hadnt recieved payment. GOOD THING  i kept my copy of the thing and sent it to the doctors. And what does cowell do (oh, who us, no, what? no wait?!) you guys suck. And then ... IT HAPPENS AGAIN! good thing the pharmacy pl are nice or id change plans. Honestly, this place needs to get its sit together.

20080207 22:10:07 nbsp My only gripe about this place is that it takes awhile to see someone, even with an appointment. However, theyre cheaper than my insurance copay. The doctors I have seen here have always been helpful. Users/WilliamLewis

20080226 10:04:15 nbsp The big problem with this is that most students are nowhere near their primary care facility (Cowell) for much of the year.  Gone for the summer?  Traveling?  On vacation somewhere?  Sorry.  You might not be covered. Users/IDoNotExist

20080413 11:40:36 nbsp I went in today (sunday) and saw Dr. Kalman. He was extremely helpful and I was so glad that urgent care was open on the weekend. THANKS!!! Users/tgdavis

20080618 nbsp NOTE: The (already high) visit prices have gone up as of 6/16/2008 by $5. Unsure whether prices have gone up for other things. I reflected the new visit prices above.

20081029 21:31:13 nbsp Ive never had a serious problem with the health center until now, when I realized how completely incompetent the doctors are. I went in for a womens annual exam, and the doctor spent a long time hardcore convincing me to go on the depo shot. She mentioned a couple side effects, but failed to mention that there is a side effect of depression... she neglected to check my chart to see Im bipolar. Ive been extremely depressed ever since, sleeping all day, become agitated with everyone around me, and lack the energy and motivation to do my school work. Its way worse than any depression Ive experienced before. The best part is theres no way to correct this, so Im doomed to wait until the shot loses its effectiveness (3 MONTHS). I seriously may have to drop out of school this quarter because its so bad. Thanks health center! Users/court

20090219 09:22:13 nbsp Although the student health center offers affordable healthcare, the people (except for the doctors) are so difficult. They insist on giving you appointments days latertheir justification is that unless you are dying (in which case you would go to urgent care) you can waitand are snappy, unhelpful, and rude. This has happened to me more than once...
Also, the staff insists that you speak to a nurse first and sometimes only a nursesome of which are straight up incompetent.  Users/student626

20100213 14:16:33 nbsp HORRIBLE SERVICES. DO NOT RECOMMEND! I went to the doctor here for a checkup.(e.g. blood test) I had a sprain ankle also. The doctor did not help one bit. She said the appointment was only going to be 15 minutes long. She spent the first 10 minutes asking me of my family history. This survey I could have done myself on the computer. Then she spends the next 3 minutes whining that she was another person to see that is already next door. After that I got a little bit angry I cut her off and demand a check up. She then spends the next 2 minutes telling me that Im fine based on my family history and that I need to drink more water.

Unless if you are dying on campus, I would go to somewhere else. Ill try out Sutter hospital next time. I hope they will be helpful.  Users/imprenditore
