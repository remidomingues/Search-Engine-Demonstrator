Cowgirl Dream Ranch was the home of the Cowboys Forgotten Horse Rescue.  As of July 2007 approximately 40 horses had been saved and placed. Volunteers were always welcome. There seemed to always be one horse needing a home, if you were looking for your new best friend, or you could go to their website and click on the rescues page.  You could contact them with horses needing help or homes.

The ranch had some wiki:wikipedia:American_Quarter_Horse_Association AQHA fillies for sale, weanling to 5 years. Reminic Lines, Zan Parr Bar. Great ranch, penning, barrel, pony jumper prospects and some are trained!

The website was updated frequently, but there might have been a horse available that was not listed or they might have known of someone selling a horse that might fit.

Boarding was also available slightly outside Davis.
