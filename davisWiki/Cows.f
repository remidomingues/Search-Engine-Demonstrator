 Yeah, Weve Got That. 




 Dairy Cows 

Approximately 100 dairy cows live in The Dairy, which is easily visible by Freshmen firstyear students that reside in the Tercero dorms (especially those in B and C buildings). If youre good, you can pet baby cows!  The entire area with the cows is open to the public, but you should follow some guidelines for the cows health.  Look around, pick your favorite, and pet that one.  Petting them all at once can transfer diseases between them; you dont want to get a calf sick, do you??  Plus, picking a favorite makes all the other cows Moo jealously.

Rarely, cows can be found Cow in the Dorms in dorms.

 Cow Milking 
Cows are milked regularly. Its very hard to Cow Tipping tip them when theyre being drained of their delicious white juice, because theyre stuck in these funky contraptions that keep them in the ideal milking position.

Milking doesnt happen only at The Dairy. Its also a signature event many times a year on campus. You can milk cows on Picnic Day and during the cow milking contest on the quad during the spring. The School of Veterinary Medicine also hosts cow milking at the California State Fair. These events are often protests protested by Students Together For Animal Rights and other vegan vegans.

 Beef Cattle 
More cows can be found west of main campus in two http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/facilities/beef.htm cattle facilities: the Animal Science Feedlot and Animal Science Beef Barn. The Feedlot is located off of Straloch Rd., west of the UC Davis Airport. The Beef Barn is located off of Brooks Rd. just west of Highway 113.

In the winter, the herds are moved to pastures near Vacaville and Folsom. Aside from calves born in these facilities, some come from the herd at the http://danrrec.ucdavis.edu/sierra_foothill/home_page.html Sierra Foothills Research and Extension Center outside wiki:yubasutter:Marysville. Beef cattle research is also performed at the http://danrrec.ucdavis.edu/desert/home_page.html Desert Research and Extension Center in Southern California.

Campus livestock is routinely sent to the Meat Lab for human consumption when it is deemed that their usefulness has ended.

 Research 

Cows are central to many research projects on campus. Research from belching (http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/01/FrontPage/UcdResearch.Sheds.Light.On.Dairy.Air1319395.shtml Aggie ArticleFootnote(Zou, Stephanie. http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/01/FrontPage/UcdResearch.Sheds.Light.On.Dairy.Air1319395.shtml UCD research sheds light on dairy air. The California Aggie. 20050201.)) to digestion (Fistulated Cow) has led to greater understanding of the cow.

The research doesnt end when the meat lab processes the livestock into beef.  Samples and entire processed carcasses are used by many different projects across camps.  Fields that use samples from the Meat Lab include Animal Science, Food Science, Reproductive Physiology, Endocrinology, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, Veterinary Medicine, Entomology, and Microbiology.  As an example, cattle blood collected during processing is used elsewhere on campus to feed mosquitoes used in research.


 Odor 
Cows (along with freshman) are the main source of the Essence of Davis. However, not all of town smells like cow dung. Usually, the smell is confined to a small area of campus near The Dairy and Tercero. The odor can most often be smelled during the afternoon and evening or when light winds blow from the southwest.

Of course, Davis cows were the first bovines to be given bathrooms... well at least showers.  In 2008, a program was started to teach cows to use pressure plate triggered showers to allow them to cool off.  In theory this will allow them to produce more milk.  No word on if there is a concurrent effort elsewhere to breed giant loofah sponges.

 Vacaville 
The nearby city of Vacaville is often jokingly referred to as Cow Town, from a deconstruction of the citys name into vaca (Spanish for cow) and ville (French for town).  However, Vacaville is actually named for Juan Manuel Vaca, a wiki:wikipedia:Californio who ranched in the area.


I dont know how it is with the kids these days, but I remember back in my time the big word around the High Schools of America was that UCD students were bigtime Cow Tipping cow tippers. Well I dont know about that, but hardly any of these cows look tipped over to me.  Users/TravisGrathwell

20060122 15:17:49 nbsp I once joked to a friend that after petting the cows, you can go to the Meat Lab nearby, and pick up a slab of beef, that was likely a relative of the cute calf you were just petting. Users/MatthewTom

20060410 13:53:54 nbsp I totally rocked the Vacaville trivia.  I am just totally awesome. Users/MatthewKeys

20060816 21:57:03 nbsp I heard that the dairy was moved from central campus to here back in the early/mid1900s when Tercero was at the very edge of the university.  Now the administration is considering moving it way, way out Russell Blvd., out towards Winters because of the smell and to make room for more buildings.  : ( Users/DanConstable

20070122 22:28:38 nbsp As of the beginning of Winter Quarter 2007, the pasture directly across the street from the Tercero South residence halls has been devoid of any cows.  Besides the widelyaccepted slaughterhouse theory, any idea on where the cows could be? Users/LeonardMarque

20070613 18:26:02 nbsp I remember back in 2001 when I got accepted to Davis and was trying to decide which dorm to live in... I looked at a map and saw Dairy Cattle Facility next to Tercero. I chose Segundo that day. What I didnt realize is that most of campus smells like cow but you stop noticing it. My parents point that out every time they come here. I liked going and visiting these guys. Users/RachelCakes

20070722 22:29:19 nbsp I just got back from staying in Tercero South for summer orientation, and there were definitely still cows at the dairy facility! It didnt seem like there were many, but there was definitely a noticeable smell. It wasnt unbearable by any means; it was just a smell. Anyway, just wanted to give an update.  Users/JeremyOgul

20070723 02:31:56 nbsp When the draft of the wind combine with certain temperature, the smell amplifies 10 folds. After you get used to it, ur gonna miss it Users/KaiWan

20070829 14:53:45 nbsp I worked and lived at the dairy for a while and can be considered in the know.  Contrary to what is stated above the dairy is NOT open to the public.  There are, in fact, signs posted everywhere declaring it to be a biosecure facility and all visitors must get permission from the office.  This is for health of the animals, especially the calves that everyone love so much.

The pasture to the south of the dairy is still in use, however the animals are brought in during the winter due to buildup of mud that occurs during the rainy season.

There has been talk of moving the dairy but so far it has just been talk.

There are approximately 100 milking cows, but if you include dry cows, heifers, and calves there are closer to 200 animals total.

The herd manager is Doug Gisi and he should be contacted if you have any interest in doing an internship at the dairy. Users/Sara2002

  Id really like to know if this dairy not being open to the public thing is recent. I interned at the dairy and have spent many hours there and have never seen a sign like that. In fact, one of the first things we were told there was that the dairy is completely open for looky loos and the only stipulation for visitors was that you be careful when petting the calves and only pet one so as to not spread diseases, and that the dairy is closed after dark.Users/Cassie

20071011 01:22:44 nbsp The official signs went up a couple years ago, and not just at the dairy but at many of the animal facilities at Davis. The heightened security is due in part to the risk of bioterrorism as well as the threat of foreign animal disease. Visitors have been and will continue to be welcome at the dairy, they just need to contact the manager to gain permission or arrange a tour.  This is important not only for animal health but for visitor safety as well.  Many times I have had to wrangle wellintentioned freshman who were in pens with the animals and walking in feed lanes while heavy equipment was being used.  Although it was pretty humorous the several times I found drunken undergrads trying to tip cows:)

Even with these rules a blind eye is still usually turned as long as visitors are behaving themselves. Users/Sara2002

  Yeah, I just recently went to visit the dairy the other day and noticed those signs (so did my friend...who lives there), but those babies were definitely not there a year ago. I know for sure I would have seen those. But yeah, its just common sense to stay out of pens and not mess with them, but Im sure Doug doesnt really care if people just wander around and take a look.

20080912 21:47:05 nbsp It was definitely a unique experience to live in first floor, Tercero South and to be able to spot the cows right across the street whenever I looked out the window... stepping outside the dorm building the day after a rain was NOT fun. Users/susiekim
