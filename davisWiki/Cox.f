Hi all, I am Kelly Cox. I do feel a little awkward making this page, but its an assignment for my Writing for the Wiki: Publishing in an Age of Ubiquitous Authorship freshman seminar, which is kind of cool! I came to Davis from Los Angeles. Honestly, it is a huge change, but I really enjoy it here in Davis. I am a first year at UC Davis, and I ultimately plan to major in viticulture and enology. Anyone can find me playing basketball at the arc or gyms working out there; I am there virtually every day. I can play basketball all day every day to be honest. I’ve found that Davis is quite a melting pot of Restaurants dinning, and also enjoy eating out, which reminds me of something important: my ability to Music freestyle rap. The reason that dining reminds of my talent is because the other weekend I had a freestyle battle at 2 in the morning at InNOut In N Out. Yes, I won, and yes my rap name is “Killa Kel.” If you see me you are more than welcome to ask me to spit a verse so to speak.
Words to describe me: schools school, family, beach, boys, shopping, swirl (frozen yogurt), food, food, food, friends, basketball, basketball, relaxing at the rec pool, working out, texting, crazy.

Another one of my hobbies is setting my friends and acquaintances up on dates. I do not know where this stems from, but I find it fun. So, on that note perfect date spots:
  Mustard Seed The Mustard SeedWonderful if you want to throw a little romance into the mix.
  Burgers and BrewVery relaxed/ casual—tasty I might add.
  SwirlGreat for a casual first hang out/ date.

If you see me on campus say hello!!!
