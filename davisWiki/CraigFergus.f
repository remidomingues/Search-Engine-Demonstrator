THIS IS OLD NEWS

Craig Fergus is a UC Davis graduate with a major in WFCB Conservation Biology, has interned with the http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/ California Water Resources Board working on wetland and riparian protection policy, monitored wood ducks duck nest boxes along Putah Creek, helped write species profiles for http://calfish.ucdavis.edu calfish.ucdavis.edu, and this summer will be conducting Northern Goshawk and Spotted owl surveys for the http://www.fs.fed.us Forest Service in http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/eldorado/ El Dorado National Forest.

He also has a show on that fine freeform radio station KDVS called http://kdvs.org/archive/?show726&titleArchive The Deep End, under the pseudonym DJ Haggis.

The http://www.rampantscotland.com/recipes/blrecipe_haggis.htm Haggis name comes from the fact that he is incredibly Scottish even though he was born and raised in the disappointingly boring city of San Jose.



The I Love Davis Davis area is a much more exciting place with a steady stream of music scene live music usually at the Delta of Venus but also in the newly christened Technocultural Studies TCS Building and wiki:sacramento Sacramentos wiki:sacramento:Fools Foundation.

Favorite local acts include: Boss The Big Bit, Antlers, and Sholi

Craig used to swim and play water polo in high school and has been planning to get in the Hickey Pool pool again for 3 years. In the mean time he hopes that his use of Bicycling bicycles as his main form as transport will suffice for exercise.

Craig also thinks the Varsity is pretty rad.

Goals (results)

  Explore The Green Belt (sorta)
  Take pictures of Davis with my new camera and add them to the wiki. (http://www.flickr.com/photos/deependdriver)
  Use the Bike Church more to turn my bruiser into some kind of mutant cruiser (new bike)
  Learn the basics of some foreign languages (I have a nice start on http://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafan Welsh)
  Become informed on important issues from Shields Library primary sources (still an ignorant American)
  Book a show (see the Villanova House for proof)

20070829 20:28:11 nbsp Craig, shouldnt you be coordinating office rather than engaging in hotheaded daviswiki debates? Users/JasonDunne

20070830 07:20:28 nbsp For two reasons: first, because it Wiki Community/General Discussion has been Wiki Social Norms archived before  Wiki Community/Ethics Discussion several times (and those are just the ones off the top of my head). A set of similar topics come up periodically, and the previous times it has come up are never cited the next time it is debated. Im not even sure they should be cited, as the editorship changes, and the current group might come to a different conclusion this particular time. As a result, I dont think even trying to archive them into something that could be pointed at would be a good idea because the eventual community decision is subject to change as the editors change, and you wind up creating dogmatic phrases rather than casual, shifting tradition that takes into account the current editors. Yes, it is a contradictory combo of it doesnt have an effect, and if it has an effect, it locks us into a view that doesnt accept the input of new editors, but thats my reasoning. Its about giving the right to new editors to have a voice in the community not completely negated by editors in the past. Experienced editors already have a strong voice if their reasoning is sound, and tradition carries enough weight to prevent a series of radically contradictory changes that are destructive to the content... theres no need to turn their views (including mine) into dogmatic liturgy. You had a perfect right to question the issue, and the resulting discussion is productive as a venue for all current editors to take stock of the current status, raise their opinions and maybe change their minds a bit.
