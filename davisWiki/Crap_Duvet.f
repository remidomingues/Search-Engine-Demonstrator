We are a cover Music Scene band from Davis, California. What do we cover, you ask? Come to one of our shows and find out, idiot.

CRAP DUVET would like to thank Sharkpunch for being straightXedge, BroXCore, and DinoXcore since 1912. SHooter would like to take attention away from the page for a minute for a special announcement. Shooter: Check our updates!

ATTENTION:  SHOOTING FIRST IS UNADVISABLE And quite frankly a stupid idea.

GO TO BAGGAGE CLAIMS PERSONAL THING FOR SPECIAL ANNNOUNCEMENT

The band came about when guitarist Isaac HamlenGomez and vocalist John Dudek joined forces to create sensational covers on downtown outings. Needing money for their other bands and their much needed Jack In The Box hash browns, they play downtown with a bowler hat on the ground, waiting for fans and friends to stop by. There is no definite schedule for shows except on occasion  so you just have to be on the lookout. Its the greatest music experience there is in Davis, so try not to miss it.  Hell yeah.

  There isnt much to say. Me and Baggage Claim are going to be at a barbecue soon, probably busting out the tunes that make us famous.

  Well there you have it. Its been over a week since the last update. Im too lazy to upkeep this page. We are soon to be adding a new addition to the website, so youll just have to wait. Baggage Claim has gone down to New Mexico for most of the remaining summer, but will be back for a week in early August, so well be playing a few shows here and there. I hope youre all exicted, because we are. We will also have a guest vocalist for a some of the shows, and he will be announced later.  Right now, Im in summer school, researching Artificial Wombs. Interesting articles. Until next update, peace out.

  So, its been a while since we updated, or hit on any chicks, but weve got our act together and are getting ready to do some gigs. We did a graduation party over the summer, and weve been invited to play at DHSs spring concert. WE NOW ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. Thank you.

  I have been in a bathrobe all day.  An attempt to record a song failed.  And by failed, I really mean that we didnt really try in the first place.  We did watch some Nickalodeon, which reminded me why I dont watch Nickalodeon.  Am i spelling that right?  who cares.  forget it.

  Well, it seems Shooter made some sick edits.  This is good.  The bad is that Im going to lame New Suxico for the break.  Another week in that stupid state.  I also updated my page.  Yep.

  Its been almost a year since we updated, and amazingly, were still in business. That is, were getting back in business with some covers in the works. I dont want to give everything away, but we are huge fans of Jurassic Park and Pirates of the Carribean. Can anybody spell medley? (I dont know if I can or not).
  So, expect us around sometime, and if you want to meet us, Im the one in the Chaps Denim sweatshirt out late on Friday nights at JackintheBox.
