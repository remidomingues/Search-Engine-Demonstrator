20110731 17:36:52 nbsp I had an appointment with Lucero recently and ended up with a nice cut and nice experience overall. Shes a genuinely nice person who took the time to discuss what would work best for my hair. After cutting and drying my hair she went back and did a few more adjustments (checking with me of course) and I was very pleased with the results. A week later Im still very happy with my cut (always have to see what happens when I go home and wash it). I also appreciated the friendliness of all of the other people working in the salan. Ill definitely be going back. Users/AnnaD

20111015 15:17:27 nbsp I had a wonderful hair appointment with Luz, who made my hair look great. Shes very friendly and it was a pleasure to have her work on my hair. I will definitely go back to Creative Hair. Users/JRW

20111020 18:59:54 nbsp I just had a great haircut from Luz. I really like it! She listened carefully to what I wanted and often asked about my opinion. I had been here previously, and always had the same experience! Thanks Luz!  Users/EliraK

20120224 11:08:02 nbsp Ive been getting my haircut with Luz for the past 2 1/2 years and I always walk out of the salon pleased with a smile on my face and a healthy/stylishdo on my head.  She listens carefully to what I request and helps me out when I ask her opinion.  I highly recommend this salon, everyone is so friendly and warm. Users/GabrielaMarble

20120831 12:33:09 nbsp Luz gives great hair cuts.  She is very friendly and her conversation is pleasant.  The salon is decorated very well.  The paintings on the wall are beautiful! Users/TheaMinsk

20130416 23:30:54 nbsp Luz is wonderful. She gave me a tricky haircut and the result exceeded my expectations. Throughout the process, she continually checked it to make sure I would be happy with the cut. I was thrilled! I was hesitant to get a high maintenance style because I dont like going to the salon. But Im actually looking forward to maintaining this look with Luz. She is talented, warm, and clearly cares about her work.  Users/KrisLeo

20130822 16:34:15 nbsp I needed a quick hair trim and got an appointment the same day with Farideh. I have long hair and she did a wonderful job, cutting it exactly the way I like it! I will definitely keep coming back to her and hopefully I can finally keep everything trimmed so I can grow my hair longer! Im very happy with my experience and would recommend Farideh to anyone for a great cut. Users/RacineBarton

20131008 16:11:52 nbsp I recently had a bad experience here, but in no way do I want to bash the individual or the business, I would just like people to be aware and cautious about where ever they go so I hope this is helpful. My hair was not quite shoulder length, I usually keep it very short, but I hadnt gone in a long time so I decided to try this place because it seemed interesting and had no bad reviews thus far. For whatever reason, the person that cut my hair really didnt know what she was doing. I dont know if she wasnt comfortable hacking off all of my hair that she thought was so beautiful or if she was simply new and had little experience cutting my hair. Im really not sure. I spent an hour there and I came out looking worse than when I came in, I had a bulky mans cut of a hair job that was too long to call it much of anything, she didnt shave my neck, she chopped off my girly sideburns, didnt texturize my hair and left me feeling as if she has violated me and just chopped my hair off. Luckily it was salvageable and this FANTASTIC woman at Supercuts (YES supercuts) fixed my hair her name is Lien and whats more, it was only $12. I guess you never know what you are going to get! On the upside my hair looks great now. I hope you found this somewhat helpful!  Users/sara.fraser92
