 History 

Creative Media was the combination of two different former units of ASUCD:  Network Services (name?) and AS Graphics.  Thus it combined the normal IT department with the group that designed ASUCDs publications and publicity, and put under a staff director (Alex Park).  The unit used to be called Media Link, but was renamed to Creative Media a few years ago.  (Despite the name, its still not considered a media unit in the ASUCD Bylaws.)

Due to the lack of checks or balances on the unit, Jonathon Leathers called for an audit of Creative Media during his winter 2005 senate campaign. Ballsy. He did not win a seat on senate, and the audit did not occur. AGTV spent some time under the California Aggie journalistic microscope in winter 2005 after the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate passed a Shadiness Factor bill that would drop $33,000 on Apple G5 computers and plasmascreen monitors for AGTV.  CM never actually spent the money, and ended up buying cheaper screens (~$11,000) from another Senate Bill.

Creative Media and the Student Government Administrative Office were the subject of an ASUCD Court http://www.ucdgreens.org/complaint_aggie_article.shtml complaint filed in March of 2004. The complaint alleged Creative Media and SGAO failed to update the ASUCD Website with documents.  However, its not actually Creative Medias responsibility, its SGAOs responsibility to keep student government uptodate.

Controller Paul Harms found an unused $8,000 line item in the Creative Media budget that past controllers had forgotten to remove.  This sort of small problem is typical in ASUCDs finances and  should not be considered a reflection on the Unit Director.
