There are many credit card companies out there that offer plastic Cards that act as Money virtual money. However, it is best to shop around for a credit card just like you shop around for the best prices on merchandise or food.

Banks and Credit Unions credit unions offer credit cards. Since credit unions are notforprofit financial cooperatives, often they can afford to provide credit cards with no annual fees and with better interest rates than banks.

For example, USE Credit Union offers credit cards with no annual fees, no cash advance fees, and no balance transfer fees.

The Card Act which took effect in 2010 now prohibits companies from giving out free prizes to students for signing up for a credit card. In addition, they are not allowed to market within 1,000 feet of campuses. These rules were put in place to try to prevent the massive debt that many students accumulate on credit cards. Often students graduate from college with thousands of dollars in debt which will take years to pay off and could ruin their credit scores.

People under 21 will need a cosigner to take on any card debt that may accumulate on a credit card. A cosigner needs to be someone over the age of 21. This could be a parent or a friend. The risk of being a cosigner is that the cosigners credit history can be damaged if the person with the credit card runs up huge credit card debts.


Dont mind giving out a ton of personal information to Shadiness Factor shady credit card people?   Then you might be able to catch a Discounts and Freebies Free Lunch here when the credit card goonies set themselves up on campus. Be careful, though.
  I recommend giving them fake info. You have no way to verify theyre legit, and even if they are, they probably dont background check the people handling the sign ups, and even if they do, that only means that nobodys caught them being naughty. Users/RyanCastellucci
    They have a digital camera with them, and they take a picture of your student id (allegedly required) and hint that a drivers license is preferable. I let them take a pic of my student id, but it seemed when I did it, I accidentally gave slightly altered info on the application. It seems my phone number, address, email, name...all one letter or number wrong! Oops. But really, the food isnt even worth it. Users/EdWins ES

Fortunately, UC Davis doesnt have nearly the credit card hawker infestation problem that places such as UC Berkeley have.

Do they hang out anywhere else but the east entrance to the Silo by the UC Davis Bookstore?  Users/JasonAller
    Depends.  Sometimes they have people passing out fliers around the Quad, Wellman Hall Wellman and the Memorial Union MU  And its not just to Mr. Chans...they do Subways as well at times.  And the last few days, the California Aggie has run coupons with free 6 inch sub + chip combos to Subways for UCD students with id only on certain days/hours, but restrictions apply.  Id be willing to bet money the restriction would have to do with Citibanks hoard of people out to get your application.  Weak. Users/EdWins ES
    The actual credit card application stuff is all done off campus, so it doesnt break any rules I dont think.   But they send people on campus to promote it (who fail to mention the CC application part).

They used to offer a free lunch at Mr. Chans if you agreed to sign up for their particular credit card.

20070406 17:37:23 nbsp I highly recommend not taking part in these activities, or giving fake information. When I was a freshman, I signed up for a couple cards for the free stuff, then canceled those cards when I received them in the mail. I must have missed one or two, or had several accounts signed up in my name when I didnt request them, because when I looked over my credit report recently, I saw there are accounts in my name that I dont use and dont have cards for and which can only be explained by my behavior freshman year. Thankfully, no one has ever hacked into those accounts or gotten ahold of any cards I should have but its still a scary situation to be in.  Users/ElleWeber
