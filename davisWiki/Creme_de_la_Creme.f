20080424 10:46:17 nbsp I cannot explain how great this place is, except via a story.  At Christmas time, my partner went into the store, looking for bath products for me (Im a bubble bath nut).  Christie placed a special order for some bath products, which were amazing.  Then, later, a friend of ours went into the store looking for a Christmas gift for us.  She not only remembered who my partner was by name, but also what she was looking for AND the types of scents she liked, and made an absolutely perfect recommendation for a gift for us.

She also has a great eye for gift baskets.  Often, well come into the store with a centerpiece item for a basket that weve obtained elsewhere (most recently, a customized cookbook).  Christie will then build, assemble, and cellophane an entire gift centered around that item (this one had an oventotableware piece as the base, a gorgeous apron, a kitchen hand soap dispenser, and a coffee mug).

Just great products and amazing service.  I have a new goto place for gifts! Users/AmandaCaudle

20091006 10:20:30 nbsp I called a few days ago asking if she had any half aprons She was extremely helpful and descriptive on the phone! (bubbly too!)  So I told her I wold come in and take a look at the apron.  It was perfect for what I needed.  Christine was so gracious and I felt right at home in her store.  She has a great assortment of items, and I think Ill be able to find a lot of great gems for birthdays and christmas, etc.  She also had this really cute halloween display right in the middle.  I felt great buying my apron from her and supporting her store.

Thank you! Users/juicee
