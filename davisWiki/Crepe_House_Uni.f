Crepe House Uni is a restaurant chain from Japan that serves Japanese style crepes and gelato. They also offer meals and Japanese street foods such as curry, wiki:wikipedia:Takoyaki, wiki:wikipedia:Okonomiyaki, zaru soba, etc.  Some have called it a wiki:wikipedia:maid cafe, but the place really isnt because there is more to a maid cafe than just the costumes, which are no longer the uniform.   They have a Videogaming Nintendo Wii connected to the television in the back and a Videogaming Sony Playstation 3 connected to both televisions. Ask at the counter if you want to play. Karaoke Night on Thursdays at 9:00 PM.

Their decor is very modern with curvedline architecture, clean lighting from the dropdown ceiling lamps, and the walls and ceiling are bright and bold pastel colors, cream green for the booths and counters, strawberry red for the support columns, fluorescent white for the ceilings. This modern sense is also reflected in the tables (stainless steel, either round or square with no hard corners) and soft, pliable plastic chairs (pale, fluorescent white  like they were made from recycled iPod cases, or the character Eve from the Pixar movie WallE). There was a mix of JPop tunes pumped over the speakers (e.g., Sowelus I Will), but it could barely be heard over the chatter of customers at the tables and booths.

Their food stations are arranged in a long curved Lshaped booth that allows standing customers to watch their order being made. Although I did not watch my order being made, my companions did note the following stations: (Going from left to right when you first walk in the door):

 There is what I will call a crepemaking station: a server has to clean the griddle, pour on the batter, spread it around, wait for it to cook on one side, then finally transfer it to a cooling rack.
 The cooled crepe shell is taken to what I will call a hotgrill station (with what appears to be a clamshell hood that can close) where the crepe is filled with either savory or sweet fillings. Once completed, it appears that the same server folds up the completed crepe and slips it into one of two packaging sheathes (either transparent plastic for cold crepes or a waxlined paper cone for hot crepes). They then match up the crepe with their copy of the receipt and call out the order number (see SERVICE below).
 There is a frozen Gelato station with at least two rows of five flavors each. Here, customers can interact directly with the servers to ask for samples (which, on opening day, can cause a bit of confusion and congestion as a server who is trying to finish up a crepe is flagged down by a customer who wants to try a sample of Green Tea Gelato).
 There is a display case that is filled with at least 3 levels of racks that (I assume) might be filled with premade products that customers are welcome to buy. When we were there, the case was empty and was being used as a temporary storage space for stacks of empty packing cones.
 There is the cash register, where customers can place and pay for their orders (see SERVICE below), menus are stacked, and napkins are dispensed from a tall selfdispensing unit (similar to the kind found in the movie theaters on F and G Street).

The ordering process is very much like that used at Old Teahouse.  Because there are no menus posted up above the cash registers, customers can grab a doublesided, plastic laminated menu from the stack at the cashiers register.  They place their order (Cash, Visa and Mastercard accepted) and are handed a receipt with an order number on it. They wait (either at their tables, or stand along the curved icecream/crepe assemblyline display) for their number to be called.


History


Originally all the working staff were (1) female; (2) Asian; (3) appeared to be under the age of 20; and (4) dressed in black, iconoclastic cafe maid outfits from top to bottom (hair ties and headbands with frilly lace; black blouses with shoulder trim; kneehigh skirts; and black stockings). The overall appearance very much resembled a Japanese maid cafe.  They were established in 1966 by Uni Public Relations Corporation in Tokyo, Japan. United States locations are/will be owned and managed by Crepe House Uni Corporation, USA or qualified franchisees.

20090115 23:14:27 nbsp Its cool that they serve the crepes in paper cones, and they are pretty good. I had the potato butter which was fine for what it is, and I tasted my friends who had ordered the Jumbo and Ham and Cheese  much more tasty (next time Ill know to order something more savory so that Im better satisfied). It was rather empty when I came in a little after dinner, and Im not sure that the location is the greatest for the quick eat type of food they serve. It seems like a great place for a quick lunch  just super far from campus. The decor is kind of fun, I like the drawings on the walls. I just dont know how successful this place will be. Good crepe, sure, but I wont go out of my way to come back unless its for a quick eat or late. Good luck! Users/ChristyMarsden

20090116 05:08:06 nbsp Well it seems as though the comments about having no male employees can be put to rest finally. Users/ThUn

20090119 13:18:46 nbsp My kids loved it. A great place to take a toddler and perfect portions for families trying to eat a more normal portion. And very tasty! Users/Lasan

20090131 19:42:37 nbsp I love Uni Crepe house! try the strawberry, banana choco fresh crepe but substitute chocolate syrup with nutella for 50cents (I think.) Its delicious and filling in my opinion :)  Not to mention the owner and workers are all very friendly and attentive to their customers.  While you wait for your crepes you can play Nintendo Wii games, Rockband, and also use their WiFi.  They will be getting their liquor license soon > sake bombs! Great place for a snack, I already come here often and will continue to do so for a long time! Users/cia0bella10

20090206 19:22:45 nbsp Serving alcohol soon. That sounds interesting. I have a couple questions. First, is there any etiquette for playing the games in the shop? It does look fun, but I have yet triied. Do I just ask someone at the counter if I can play or what? Second, any chance at having nutrition facts  along side of the menu posted here? Any word on getting the US version of the website up?  Users/CarlosBarahona

Hello Carlos,
1. You just have to be a customer to play the games. Please ask one of the workers and well get things set up for you.
2. We are working on the complete nutrition facts booklet that will be available to view in the shop, and also on the website. Currently we have nutrition facts for our two new items, Mixed Berries and Caramel Apple, posted on the window and calories amount of most of the menu items.
3. I apologize for the delay of the US website. The design layout is completed, but we are still working on the contents.

Thank you very much for your time. Users/Sagat

20090209 03:47:05 nbsp Ive been here a couple of times. The crepes are very tasty, but can take awhile to prepare. I would only go here for a snack or dessert since the crepes filling is a bit small. Sophies Crepes is still my favorite place for quantity, but Uni is great for the taste. Users/TonyaNN

20090214 18:42:33 nbsp TO: CovertProfessor or maybe I should say Pervert Professor. Maybe you should keep your mind out of the gutter when youre looking at their clothes.  Girls here wear miniskirts and are more revealing than those uniforms. The only thing I see is a small portion of their legs on those uniforms, other than that theyre covered up everywhere else. I dont think it degrades women, I think they look cute. Maybe youre just afraid of hot girls coming up to you. Ive never eaten here, but they should deserve respect.  Most of these girls are probably college students and are honest hard workers. Give them some slack!  Users/vietgirlwithappetite
  100 bonus points for anyone who can spot the multiple ironies in this comment.   Users/CovertProfessor

I apologize for my untrained eyesI was unable to spot any irony in vietgirlwithappetites comment.
Ive been to Crepe House Uni, and seriously, I only see elbows and knees.
the girls are very professional and I dont think a person whos never been to the restaurant would be able to provide an accurate evaluation of the servers who work there.

Anyway, I did spot multiple ironies in most of CovertProfessors comments.

1) claiming to be an educator, he/she perpetuates misleading stereotypes of the American pop culture about maid uniforms (as he/she frequently relates them to the word sexy) This is equally offensive to the American stereotypes about Geishas being prostitutes.  It would be an irony if this is what they teach in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world.

2) CovertProfessor talks about respect for women while he/she doesnt even know how to respect another countrys culture.

3) CovertProfessor thinks that the view of women as servants does not project a positive picture of women  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the definition of a waitress is CHIEFLY U.S. A female servant in a private house whose duty is to wait upon those at table (cf. WAITER 7c) OUCH! Ive been a waitress myself and I think Ive just been intimidated

Lastly, CovertProfessors second last comment on this page was This is my last comment on this page; I will make no further comment.  Definitely my favorite irony of the page.

Do I get bonus points for spotting so many ironies?
   Thank you, Users/Jewel, for unintentionally committing the same irony that is in Users/vietgirlwithappetites comment.  Sad that it is so hard to spot.  But yes, I give you a point for the deep observation that I did indeed break my word.  I could not resist.   Users/CovertProfessor
     Good job, Jewel, http://daviswiki.org/Crepe_House_Uni?actiondiff&version2257&version1256 you caught and fixed your irony.  Theres hope for you yet.   Users/CovertProfessor

           Jewel, thanks for your comment it is a good defense. Anyway, do not mind what the Coverprofessor says to you. No matter what, it will never understand the cultural aspect of Crepehouse Uni or the maid/cosplay uniforms. I am very fearful that such a closeminded professor may exist on campus. As a student, that makes me wonder how bad of an education I can receive from what may be one of my professors? Thats ironic enough to me. Anyways, it did say that it would not comment on our page again, but that was a fail. haha
           Again, the uniforms are in no way a degradation of women; they are in no way sexy. The uniforms add to the theme and the atmosphere of the restaurant. People who do not understand them and refuse to even try to understand them will never see their value.
           Thank you again Jewel and Vietgirlwithappetite for helping to upkeep Unis reputation as a Japanese family crepe restaurant and not some kind of pervert lounge. Users/ThUn


20090216 23:14:24 nbsp Service and food were initially fine; but lately service has been very poor. Servers have been rude; e.g.unwilling to help when I requested help, even though there were not many people in the shop. Please remind workers that customer service is extremely important!!

Thanks. Users/lop

Hello lop,

Thank you very much for taking your time to comment and I am sorry about your bad experiences. I shall address this problem with my employees so that it wont happen again. Users/Sagat




20090217 15:04:17 nbsp I come in here expecting to wait a little longer for my crepe, but its definitely worth it. Its a cute little place, and its nice to be able to try something new each time. The crepes are scrumptious, but not quite filling. Quality over quantity, for sure. Users/MichellePalmer

20090220 21:44:50 nbsp I love Crepe House!!!! The desserts crepes are so much than at crepeville. I love the texture of the crepe and how it kind of melts in your mouth. Ill definitely be going back for another one soon. Oh! love the uniforms too, super cute Users/Tiffee

20090224 20:04:47 nbsp The food was good and Id go back there if not for the uniforms and weird halloween decorations all over the interior. Shame that an otherwise good place has to be turned into something so weird. Users/Fidelity

20090305 20:39:07 nbsp I have only tried the sweeter crepes and I really enjoyed them.  The girls were extremely nice, sweet, and patient.  I like the vibe of the store, and would like to applaud the owner for his dedication to customer service and feedback.  I also admire his construction of a very focused concept for this restaurant, which is innovative, eye catching, and a good change for a semiboring city like Davis.

As for the uniforms, I dont think that they are degrading women at all.  Many restaurants have uniforms that are made to fit into the context of their business theme.  Crepe House Uni is no different.  The costumes do not show a lot of skin, are very cute, and matches well considering that this is a more modern/hip Japanesestyled restaurant. Users/renee415

20090306 19:59:40 nbsp my boyfriend and I went here last night. i have to say that I have never been more apauled at the lack of professionalism.  while friendly, i was thoroughly disturbed that the employee making our crepes did not use gloves and have long matted hair hanging in her face (and over the food).  we waited 20 minutes for two simple crepes.  i acknowlege that they were very apologetic for the wait, but all the same it shouldt have happened as it was late and night with hardly anyone else there.  the place itself is clean, but i was neither pleased with the service, food, nor hygiene.  to those at crepe house uni: gloves and hair nets (or other means of keeping hair in a customers food!) are encouraged by the FDA.  At the very least, I implore you, put your hair back! Users/reen

There are clearly both positive and negative comments on the page, and I dont think that Ive ever seen any comments removed from this page.  In fact, your own negative comment about Uni directly precedes your comment about negative comments not being allowed.  So I dont think that your statement can possibly be accurate.

20090309 23:06:33 nbsp Hello Reen,

Thank you very much for your time.

I once again apologize for the slow service. We had a lot of orders right before you and your boyfriend came in. We ran out of both crepe mix and whipped cream. Please understand that we tried our very best to deliver your order as soon as we could.

All employees are required to wash their hands as often as they can. Once they have leave the kitchen area or they have touched anything other than food, utensils, and containers, they have to wash their hands again. None of them are allowed to have long nails. All my employees knows that is our number one rule. It is also extrememly hard to make crepes with gloves on due to the traction.

Regarding to the hair part, I apologize for my employee who just came in for her shift forgot to tie her hair up rightaway. I will make sure it wont happen again.

Lastly, I have never delete any comments, positive or negative, on this page. If you would please click on the info link on the top of the page, it will show you what changes are made to this page, including deleted comments, and by whom.

20090330 12:05:42 nbsp I just tried the crepes here yesterday with my boyfriend and his mom. We ordered the cajun sausage, jumbo chicken and portobello crepes and finished off with a azuki bean and green tea dessert crepe. Crepe House Uni has, by far, the best crepes i have ever tasted. The owner Sagat, was very polite (so were the other employees), outgoing, and attentive to our needs.  Theres plenty of other crepes that I would like to try so I will definitely be back soon. Users/trambajuice

 Hello Trambajuice: Thank you very much for your visit and it was my pleasure to meet you, your boyfriend, and his mother. I look forward to meeting all of you again!

20090416 17:50:15 nbsp Hello CEO Sagat,

Please call me back. I have been waiting for you to call me back in the last couple of days.  I left you a message at 11:00 am today.  Please advise me if this is not a good idea, otherwise, I will begin to use this channel to communicate with you daily.  Hopefully this is the right channel to contact you. Users/Gloria

20090426 19:05:24 nbsp I went to Crepe House Uni for the first time last night.  The place is nice and the employees are friendly.   Service could be a little faster, but I guess it is put into making a good crepe.  Ill be coming again soon. :o) Users/strawberry

 Hello Strawberry: I apologize for your wait and appreciate your patience. All crepes are madetoorder so it may take a little while for us to deliver your order. Please understand that we try our very best to shorten your wait time. We look forward to serve you again!

20090506 22:01:52 nbsp I love crepes. Coming from the Bay Area, I have eaten crepes at numerous places. I was very excited when I heard Crepe House Uni was coming and it was a Japanesestyle crepe restaurant. First time, I went there I encountered Sagat. Sagat was very friendly and polite! I was immediately taken by Sagats professionalism and was treated very well. In the Asian culture (Im Asian), it is very important to treat customers with the utmost respect, and I was not failed by the employees of Crepe House Uni.

>Food: A The menu offers a wide variety of crepes from hot to cold deserts. Their gelato is also very delicious. I ordered the Gelato Crepe with Nutella and Chocolate Hazelnut. The crepe came out very quickly (under 10 minutes) and the crepe wrapper was very delightful and easy to use as well. The gelato was creamy and cold and tasted exactly what I wanted chocolate hazelnut. The substitution for Nutella was also very worth it for the extra $.50. I will most definitely come back here to try the hot crepes!<

>Location/Ambiance: B+ Crepe House Uni is located in a great place in downtown next to Beach Hut Deli and Sophias Thai Kitchen, near the Borders Plaza and movie theaters. Its a great place to walk downtown and catch some great desert! The look of the restaurant inside is very modern, and with my appreciation for art, I liked the paintings on the walls. They have a WII that anyone can play with! The only problem is is that the place is so big that I can never imagine it being truly full. The tables and chairs looked modern, but when I sat in it, it seemed like any other regular chair. I also heard rumors of their new menu on the wall, but I have yet to see it. The location of the cash register was also very convenient. I walk in and look at their selection then I approach the nice employee ready to take my money for some delish crepes :).<

>Service: A  As I have mentioned, all the employees are extremely polite. They have been welltrained and I commemorate Sagat for choosing nice employees! Just keep on saying hello, thank you, and please, then I will keep coming back! I also liked it when they had the work uniforms on. I have a good appreciation of those types of unique clothing. I hope they continue with the Japanese tradition! <

 Users/missmochi

 Hello Miss Mochi: Thank you very much for taking time to leave us a comment and I am most delightful to hear that you have good experiences at our restaurant. We look forward to serve you again!

 As opposed to sitting in super chairs? I dont get it. Anyways, I tried their crepe a few months back. I had the savory crepe and it just was decent, but then again, this was a while ago. Maybe Ill just stick to desert crepe next time. Their gelato selection do look amazing. Users/KimN.

20090520 22:33:53 nbsp 你好...very good sake :) May we have the Japanese beer please? Very good service and food, may be advertise on youtube? Have you checked out the yelp reviews too? http://www.yelp.com/biz/crepehouseunidavis2#hrid:GKRaWEYqh5tDFy7Yx2J8lQ/src:search/query:crepe   Users/sojoman

 Hello Sojoman: We now offer a wide selection of Japanese beer, including highend ones such as Koshihikari Echigo and Yebisu. I have always check reviews on Yelp and also respond to comments. Thank you very much!

20090521 15:44:24 nbsp Hi! I heard about this place recently and I stopped by Tuesday afternoon with my friends. I really love cosplay and such and was hoping to see some of the uniforms but no one was dressed up when I went. Are there certain times when the employees dress up? Users/cutiekun
 Hello Cutiekun: Thank you for your visit! We are having our new uniforms made at the moment. Please be patience. We are going to host Cosplay Night again very soon. Hope you can come join us!

20090607 22:02:18 nbsp I noticed several of the Yelp reviews mention the uniforms seem to be gone. Sagat, can you clarify cosplay night?  I take that to mean its no longer a theme and permanent dress code for employees, and that the maid costumes are now going to be only for special events. Is there a new standard uniform?  Users/EdWins

 Hello EdWins: Cosplay night is for all customers who likes to cosplay to gather together and vote for the best costume. Customers who dress up will also receive a discount. We are having a new set of uniform made but as we are waiting on that, we dont have a set dress code. The maid costumes will be saved for specific locations in the future. As we have more different styles of uniforms, we will rotate them once in a while.

20090627 09:19:02 nbsp When will cosplay night be?  Users/cutiekun

20090730 01:18:44 nbsp Wow this page was interesting to read! haha... almost like seeing a car accident on the road... theres a morbid fascination. Anyway, I really like this place. Im noooot so much into the coffee but Im a really picky coffee drinker so sometimes I bashfully walk in with a cup Ive purchased somewhere else. Ive been playfully teased about it but it was all in good fun. I havent tried all the crepes and its been awhile since the gelato, but what Ive had Ive really liked. I do wish the portions were a bit bigger or more full of stuff but thats the American in me speaking out. But the service is always great and the ambience is awesome and theres nowhere else like it. I came in with one of the UCD Japanese professors once too for a little dessert after dinner and she said she loves the place too. :) Ive been concerned in the past about the survival of this place cause I definitely dont want to see it go down, but its still here and things appear to be ok. :) woot. Users/hitobito

  hitobito, your coffee from an outside location is more than welcome in our store. We totally understand that people like to mixandmatch their food and drink, or people want to bring in certain things from other places while studying. Dont be shy about your coffee, no need at all. We are trying are best to keep UNI running. Hopefully business picks up with the beginning of the school year.  Users/ThUn

20090813 12:10:00 nbsp Crepe House Uni has been closed the last 2 Tuesdays in a row when we went between 3pm and 4pm. All the tables and chairs from outside were missing, and the lights were out. There was nothing posted around, so we have no idea what is going on. The food here was always awesome, but weve had to get our fix elsewhere. Are these new unposted summer hours? Users/robvanacker

  robvanacker, we apologize for the inconvenience. I posted the summer hours on here about 2 weeks ago. Please check them out about. MW we open at 5pm and close at 11pm for the summer. I hope this helps. Users/ThUn

20090831 19:28:16 nbsp Hi Sagat and Crepe House Uni friends! I am always at Crepe House Uni as I find it a wonderful place to study and do work and I really enjoy the sorbets here. I have just one gripe. Since my first visits at Crepe House, my diet has changed significantly and I no longer eat animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, or honey). While I used to really enjoy your crepes, I am no longer to eat a single crepe here because the special crepe batter contains dairy. Is there any chance that new, dairyfree crepes might be introduced to the menu? As a loyal and frequent customer, this is something I would really appreciate!

Thank you for your kindness and hard work. Go Crepe House! :o) Users/ChrissyNoble

  Hello Chrissy! Thank you very much for your comments! We can make our crepe batter with soy milk and egg substitute, but the crepe mix itself contains nonfat milk powder. I dont think the headquarters in Japan will make a vegan version of the crepe mix, but I can definately look into that. However it might be a lengthy process. Users/Sagat

20090903 16:55:04 nbsp Went there once some time ago, so they may have changed. But I got a desert crepe that had a drizzle of chocolate, a few almonds/walnuts and a drizzle of whipped cream wrapped up in layers of tasteless crepe. Maybe their savory is better. Users/jdavis

20090910 22:59:52 nbsp Dang! So many comments here. Sagat obviously takes a very active role on this page. But why does the main description also double as someones review?

Anyway, I like this place, even after just a few visits. The crepes are finer than elsewhere in town, and I feel like the portions have grown over time. I like the California and Portobello crepes, and the curry special was pretty good too. In all cases, enough food for the meal, even if you feel like youre paying a bit much for the amount. Then again, all the prices on the menu are adjusted to include sales tax.

Hard to decide whether Ice Krimski or Crepe Uni have the better gelato, but after years in Davis without any decent gelato, its nice to even have that problem. If you have $2.50 to spend on two ounces of tasty goodness, you really cant go wrong. Especially with the marvel of free samples.

The service has gotten some attention in other comments. My experience has always been that the cashiers, servers, etc. have been friendly and helpful. My one criticism would be getting the occasional mumbler who makes no eye contact and appears to be uninterested in selling me food. Shyness or earlystage trainee? Both?

I hope business picks up when school starts again. Im just starting to think of Crepe House Uni as a regularish eating/working venue. Users/Santani

20091030 09:57:34 nbsp Crepe house uni has great crepes, but consistently terrible service. My friends and I have waited up to twenty minutes for a crepe before, and the place wasn’t even busy that day. Also, there are a few extremely rude workers here. I once went with two friends and they got our orders messed up and some girl came and asked my friend if this one crepe was hers, and my friend said she didn’t think that was what she ordered and if there were any more being made, and the worker girl just said no and tossed the plate on the table and walked away. It turned out it was indeed not the crepe she ordered as it came about fifteen minutes later and nobody claimed it. Same thing happened to me with a middle aged male employee (maybe the owner?). Anyways he brought me a crepe that was not what I ordered so I told him so and he just stood there and rolled his eyes at me.
Amazingly crappy service. The only nice employee is the young guy with glasses.
 Users/essyyun

20091229 16:04:18 nbsp I could have sworn I commented earlier this year when I came here during the summer. I really enjoyed the 2for1 special they had this summer, and bought an almond creme and a caramel apple crepe. I liked them both, but wished that my almonds had been spread out more, because I got them all in the first bite. Also, there was a bit too much caramel on the apple one, so much, in fact, that my 10 year old sister couldnt even finish it. But besides that, I enjoyed my crepes. Users/BrookeB

20100122 17:52:57 nbsp This place is a lot of fun and the crepes are delicious.

As for the uniforms, I thought they stopped using them, and I had no problem with them back when they had them.

I honestly think anyone who has an issue with the uniform really could use a little selfexamination.  These uniforms arent any more disrespectful to the women who wear them than basketball uniforms are to basketball players. Users/rfrazier

20100203 10:42:07 nbsp This place is more of a dessert/snack/hangout place than a full meal kind of restaurant.  i think thats the mistake most people make about it.  Dont come to eat if youre really starving that badly, because youll spend a lot filling up slowly on what are basically snacks.  That said, the food is really good, in my experience, and definitely very unique for Davis.  Im not sure where else youd get anything like it.  I feel that the staff have been very friendly, and while the waits can be long, they are worth it.

This is the kind of place youd want to go with friends to study or hang out; the atmosphere is super nice and there are video games to play as well as wifi if you need internet.

You can also customize your food as you likeone of my housemates is the dork who ordered the bacon and strawberry crepe.  Have some strange custom creation in mind?  See if they have the ingredients, maybe theyll make it for you.

Also, just saying, I can see why there would be controversy over the old uniforms, but theyre pretty cute and conservative and no one had to or did behave like a maid, so I guess I personally never felt anything about it.  I thought it might be really fun to work in such cute uniforms, so I was sorry to see them go.   Users/KayChang

20100204 12:43:48 nbsp I havent been back to this place since it first opened but I stopped by today and got one of their fruit crepes. The portions have changed quite a bit since I last went; it was a pretty huge amount, enough to make a meal even (Id only stopped by for a snack). Pretty good for the price and definitely more than I was expecting even hearing that theyd increased the portions. Users/Ravyn

20100216 20:32:13 nbsp Buttermilk crepe is amazing! Great dessert or snack for only $3!
Everyone should give it a try at least once. :) Users/yubin

20100216 22:08:58 nbsp I hate this place.

Everytime that Ive ordered a crepe here, they have ran out of the appropriate ingredients to make my crepe, made me wait at least 2030 minutes for my one dessert crepe to come out, and gotten me sick. I felt nauseous after eating their crepes and their crepes are not at all Japanese to me. I have had my fair share of Japanese crepes and these are not it. Id rather go to Crepeville.  Users/JYuki

  Hello JYuki, we apologize for any negative experiences youve had at CHU. It would be helpful if you could be more specific with your experiences. It is rare that we run out of ingredients for crepes, in most cases we will either allow you to substitute the crepe, or we will not even serve the crepe for the day if we are out of the necessary ingredients. Also, the average wait time for a crepe is about 510 minutes. The place feels like fast food and sometimes people expect the crepes to be done almost instantaneously after they order. I do want to clarify that the wait time depends on the number of orders ahead of you, what comes before your order (i.e. Takoyaki, which takes 20 minutes to make and requires you to focus all attention on it), and the number of workers we have on shift (sometimes one person on shift during slower times). As it is our responsibility to warn you for a long wait, please do help to understand our line flow. If you felt sick because of our crepes then we apologize, but we have not had this complaint before as our crepe mix as well as construction is very systematic. Our crepes are by definition Japanese style crepes, reason being is the batter is made in a completely different way when compared to French crepes. In essence, we do serve Japanese style crepes, and we try our best to satisfy the needs of our customers. We do thank you for your feedback and we will try to improve the wait times of our products as much as possible. Users/ThUn

20100228 00:22:00 nbsp Ive read a few people are upset with waiting for their food, and as an avid diner Im sure I agree.... but sometimes you have to wait for quality! I work at a small restaurant myself, and I know what it can be like when youre understaffed everyone is trying to do their best.  In places like Davis, most times all you need is one or two people working to run a whole place since some days can be so slow.  Anyhow, back to CHU, Ive been going here since it opened, and I LOVE the green tea macha dango special.  Its a crepe filled with red bean, topped with green tea, more red bean, whipped cream, and fresh mochi!  If youve never had fresh mochi before you should definitely try it.  It usually takes about 10 minutes to wait, so be patient.  Also the ramen is pretty yummy too! It takes awhile to make sometimes, so beware if you have a big group.  But hands down, quality is great and worth the wait. Users/juicee

20100303 17:36:37 nbsp LOVE the Green tea gelato! I like the fact that they let you chose whether you want to hold the crepe (the traditional way) or have it on a plate (less messy)  Users/LeeY

20100306 14:09:34 nbsp What happened to this place? We brought some out of town guests to try the crepes here (after raving about them so much) only to find that A LOT of things were not available to order  enough that they had a postit on the register listing what they were out of. Coincidentally, all four of us had to change our individual orders because they included the unavailable items. We just couldnt shake the feeling that this place has gone downhill  the level of disorganization made it feel like this wasnt just a really busy night.

The employees were visibly stressed about it so we still ordered and made substitutions, but it was all kind of a bummer.

The awful karaoke singing didnt help the situation  but theres not much you can do to help that except order your crepe to go! Users/MichellePalmer

  3/12/10  I passed by tonight and the place was closed. A note on the door said theyd reopen after their next shipment of products, so who knows.

20100318 23:18:15 nbsp Greetings Everyone、

So just to clear up things, FDA regulations changed in which our last order of Crepe batter and international products were refused into the country. From that, we were not able to carry our primary items since the middle of February. Because of this Sagat made a difficult decision to move the business back to Asia where it is likely to prosper and continue to grow.

We would like to thank you all for being loyal customers to CHU. We totally did not expect this to happen at all, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. We enjoyed serving you during our time in Davis. Thank you everyone for making CHU happen over the last year.

どもありがとうございます皆様！ Users/ThUn

  Thanks for the clarification.  Im curious as to what regulation changes banned which components of the ingredients.  Probably something trivial. Users/AlexanderHo

  Anyone know how to contact Sagat Cheung or Cherrie Cheung? Any information is appreciated! You can send it to me via my email patrick.nip@gmail.com. Thanks in advance...

20100318 23:45:34 nbsp Hi All,

I would like to know Sagat where about? I need to contact her as soon as possible. If anyone have her contact info other than her cell. Please help!! Users/pnip

20100319 13:27:21 nbsp Oh No!! We LOVE this store! Whats it about no importing of international food into the county? Ethic stores everywhere in US sell international food? :( Users/LeeY

20100319 13:33:38 nbsp There is some undisclosed ingredient in our Crepe batter that was refused into the country with our last shipment that was supposed to come in late January. We toughed it out with our remaining batter till the beginning of March which explains the drop in business hours, but we found out during the end of February that we could no longer get our batter into the states. Because of the lack of notice in expectation of the batter coming in soon, we were not able to formulate an alternative batter in time to recover what we would need to cover the expenses of keeping the shop open. With that, it was decided that the shop will relocate to Asia. You are free to email Sagat with any other questions. I can only disclose the basic information that I am aware of. Im sorry if this is not of any help. Thank you for your understanding. Users/ThUn

20100319 13:41:25 nbsp Any idea what that ingredient was, or why it isnt allowed in?  Is it harmful in some way? Users/IDoNotExist

20100319 16:01:52 nbsp Theres an eviction notice on the door... My understanding was that an Eviction Restoration Notice is posted after the eviction date, and basically means you cant come back in without a Sheriff and prevents people from trying to change the locks on their last day or something silly like that.  If thats the case, there should have been an eviction notice either served personally to the owner or posted publically prior to their last days in that location open or not  which would be when the eviction restoration notice is generally put up  and the date on it for 3/18 seems to be right on.    Maybe Im being overly cynical, but I think theres certainly something more going on here than a voluntary relocation to overseas.   Users/EdWins ES
  Of course it was not voluntary. I would love to stay in Davis if things turned out better. While it was still possible (yet extremely hard) to obtain funding, without the crepe mix for the next couple of months I would not be able to open my doors and expenses will continue to accumulate. It was a tough decision to make, but also to avoid additional losses. Users/Sagat

20100319 16:07:09 nbsp Because of the reduced hours and some financial difficulties, we simply couldnt stay open in Davis any longer. The rent wasnt able to be paid. Bad economy, bad times. \ Users/ThUn

20100319 23:07:09 nbsp ES is very observant, ThUn you have edited my comment out before, I supposed, in the spirit to protect your friend. I admired your loyalty but at the same time really disappointed with your blind allegiance to an undeserving individual. Our family lent 150k to help Sagat opened up CHU 2 years ago. From the instance she received the fund, she has broken almost every promises she made to us. And now the store is closed and we are left out in the cold. I want to set the record straight and let everyone knows who is the real Sagat Cheung, basically just a common crook who wore different faces to get what she wants. In case anyone think I am just a disgruntled irrational individual who is out just to try to ruin her reputation, I can tell you there is already a court judgment filed against her (checked the county recorder office today, not filed by me). If you are still doubtful about my claim and if you care enough to find out the truth about Sagat, you can probably interview the loft building landlord to get a third person view about Sagat Cheung.

And if Sagat, you read my comment and felt that you want to rebut anything I said above, please feel free to call me or respond to my comment. And one last thing Sagat, the damage you have caused us transcend the boundary of monetary damage, you have basically tore our family apart and for that I hope you may never be able to sleep well at night. Users/pnip
  Pnip, Ive left you a message on your user page.  You can check it out by clicking your username here, or scrolling to the top of the screen and clicking either your username or the Messages! notice in the upper right corner. Users/TomGarberson
  Tom, the judgment against her isnt from me. Although there is one coming from me obviously. Users/pnip

20100320 02:15:33 nbsp Pnip I did not edit your comment out, someone else did that because your comments are personal attacks on Sagat, not anything relevant to the store in terms of service/quality, etc. I understand your hard feelings against Sagat, but I am not in anyway serving an allegiance to her. Whatever the financial situation may be, I can only disclose whatever I am aware of.

Whatever has gone on between you two is between the two of you. I have spoken with the loft manager Karen, so I know whats going on and the situation with the rent, etc. As a former employee I speak to clarify the curiosities of our customers who would like to know what has happened to CHU. Pnip I have not called you or emailed you because it is not my responsibility to do so.

I am merely an employee of CHU, I am not Sagats legal representative, we are not even close friends or anything of the sort. I recommend you keep your personal feelings between you and her, and keep your approach professional. Slander is not appropriate and if you really need to contact her I am sure you have her phone number or email address, you managed to find mine (which was a little stalkerish). I am not a liaison for Sagat. I am a former employee of Crepehouse Uni. Nothing more, please forward your concerns to Sagat, not me. I am not on here to be attacked because of some personal battle between you two, I am here to add clarification for those who wonder why the shop closed.  Users/ThUn
   ThUn, for your information, it is only slander when anything I said is nonfactual (albeit whom I believed remove my comment before). Secondly, you think I have not tried contact her through her cell or by email like a thousands times already? Please dont get too sensitive here, I dont think I have attacked you at all. All I want is to share information about the Sagat that Ive come to experience in order to help anyone who might have the misfortune to deal with this individual in the future. Thirdly, if any of you can get a hold of Sagat, please ask her what wrong have I done to her to deserve this kind of treatment from her. Last but not least, when you have a debtor try to flee from you, I think one would try every available avenues to get hold of her, I did tried to contact you to see if you can tell me Sagats where about, it is definitely not your responsibility to tell me but any info is appreciated  Users/pnip

20100320 08:25:35 nbsp 1. We are closing our location in Davis but we will still be opening in Hawaii next month and also in Asia.
2. Patrick, I have sent Gloria emails. I did make payments to you guys and if they were late (if so only by a couple of days) I always paid the late fee. If you did not receive my emails, I apologize. I am not sure what sort of promises that I made and did not fulfill. Our contract is not up until August (It is March now if I may remind you) of this year and if the payments were late I always paid the 10% late fees and the ridiculous $200 return check fee even though they were online transfers. I did not run away and I am not going to, but I also do not have obligations to accept phone calls. I have done everything according to the contract we have. The personal attacks are very unprofessional.
3. ThuN does not represent our company. He is a former employee and only speaks according to his knowledge.
4. We did owe rent to the landlord, thus the eviction notice.
5. There is nothing harmful in the crepe mix. They became strict with regulations and we would have to apply for 2 more licenses, which would take another 12 months.

Thank you very much for all your prolonged support and your time to make us better. We shall see you in Hawaii and Asia. Users/Sagat

20100320 19:41:57 nbsp Users/pnip: I dont see how a tax lien (the judgement filed against her company as you mentioned) and falling behind on rent payments affect personal character. Its tough times and sh!t happens. There are tons of restaurants going out of business within the past year, my dads was one of them because he couldnt come up with rent and its been opened for 12 years.

If Sagat is still making payments to you then I dont see a problem? From my understanding the only promise made in a loan agreement is to pay. If she really was running away with your 150k still doesnt mean you can come here and post all those personal attack comments. I dont believe you are even a Davis resident.  Slander is not only inappropriate, its also against the law.

I have only been to Crepe House once or twice, but Im sad to see it go. I am sure it will do a lot better in Hawaii and Asia. Best of luck!     Users/StellaTo

20100327 01:21:14 nbsp Wow...too bad about this place! I ate at CHU in Japan, but never got around to trying it here! I guess I never will...
This is really too bad, we dont have anything like CHU in Davis! I hope the next restaurant that comes through will be just as unique.  Users/ArianeMetz
