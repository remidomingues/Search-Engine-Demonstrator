Crepeville is famous for their crepes and the sheer number of students that bring their parents here when they come to visit. It provides a good place for groups to eat because individuals order and pay separately at the counter. The food, however, is delivered to your table by a server. The average crepe costs about $7, including browned potatoes (you can substitute a side salad for the potatoes for a small charge). They also have omelets, bagels, sandwiches, Hamburgers burgers, pastas, soup & salads, and cafetype drinks. A lot of people Study Spots study here due to the fact they have free WiFi Hot Spots wireless Internet and a wide selection of Caffeine caffeinated beverages, including free coffee refills. However, their management is increasingly frustrated with studiers, so please be sensitive to how you use their space so that they dont decide to take away the free wifi.

For many years they were cash only, but as of summer 2012 they have started accepting credit cards.  There is an ATM inside the restaurant that you can use to get cash, (although this may have disappeared since they started taking credit cards).

Their water is selfserve, and they offer lemon slices with it for additional refreshing goodness.

Currently the Linux Users Group of Davis (LUGOD) meets here on the first Tuesday evening of the month. The Unofficial Davis Scrabble Club usually meets here on Wednesday evenings.

The building housing Crepeville was previously home to the shortlived Central Park Grocery, a hybrid delicoffee housewine bar concept created by Bob Dunning Bob Dunnings wife, Shelley. Her creative vision for the site is still evident in the large, unique tiles that line the cafes upper walls.

Note that Crepeville is not set up to take phone orders for take out.  If you call ahead, once you arrive you will still have to wait on the regular line while the people in front of you are hemming and hawing about what to order.  For example, you might be told that your food will be ready in 10 minutes  and it will  but if you show up 10 minutes after making your call you will have to sadly watch your food getting cold while you stand on line for another 1015 minutes.  The lesson is to only make phone orders when they are not busy.

20090111 12:09:33 nbsp My husband and I have been going to Crepeville for almost a year now and we go 23 times a week. The staff is usually very friendly and yes they do come and go a lot. There is some faces that do stay around and some that go on to other Crepevilles in Sac to work. They know us for the most part and know exactly what I want to order, Simon (the manager of this Davis Crepeville) was always friendly,said hi and came to talk with us and was there a lot working and helping. When the place was really busy he would always try to find us a table I cannot say that for the General manager that is there now. They let Simon go and I was really upset by that. He was a asset to this Davis Crepeville and people will notice he is gone once they figure it out. Simon spent so much time there as I always wondered what his wife thought about him being gone so much. This place will definitely not be the same without Simon as he was a very nice guy and hard worker. The General manager there now that got rid of Simon you hardly see him there and I was also told he is not the best to work for. Thats really too bad and Simon if your reading this you know who we are....Strawberry crepe girl!!! Hope you find a great place to work and someone that appreciates your hard work and long hours. Hope to run into you some day. I know a few of the girls miss you that have been there for awhile. Good Luck!! Strawberry Crepe & Potatoes girl! Its the best!!  Never had a bad meal there yet. Its all good!! except the Tofu....Users/Crepegirl

20090202 01:51:06 nbsp My favorite place to eat in Davis! It is AMAZING. I recommend the Denver crepe, Canadian Benedict, and Strawberry Nutella crepe. They are all delicious. Mmmm.  Users/KRSanta88

20090202 14:00:33 nbsp The California Crepe is one of the best vegetarian options in Davis. It has the perfect medley of flavors: sundried tomato, avocado and cheese. The side of potatoes and sour cream makes for a filling meal. Crepeville gets really busy, especially on Saturday mornings and afternoons, as it captures the Farmers Market rush. The salad portions are pretty big, and they give you a bread roll with all salads, even half salads. If youve never had a crepe, try the California crepe! Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090312 22:49:11 nbsp Stopped by this morning.  I wish the coffee was better.  If I want a crape, I come here, but outside of the crape..this place does not do it for me. Users/davisdan

20090331 22:31:58 nbsp I just had a mediocre breakfast at Crepeville today.  So Im a little confused at all the rave reviews about this place.  I ordered the Canadian Benedict and a side of chicken apple sausage.  Both were bleh.  I was particularly disappointed in the sausage because Ive had some really good chicken apple sausage before  and this was probably the worst.  It was too salty and didnt have enough actual flavor to it.  The potatoes were pretty good  nothing special though.  Considering this place was a bit pricey for food thats just bleh  I dont know if I want to come back.  Maybe next time, Ill have try a dish thats recommended. Users/Hyungmi

20090413 15:07:22 nbsp Homemade dressing, garlicy croutons, fancy carrots, crisp romaine...Best Caesar salad Ive had in a long time!! Users/Lala

20090427 21:15:14 nbsp I really used to love the potatoes here, but the last two times I went, they were overly burnt. Maybe thats how it is supposed to be?

The only crepes I eat here are the dessert ones, especially the lemon one. But I honestly prefer the crepe cafe in the silo because crepevilles lemon sauce it just a little too much. I still think its a nice place to go out with friends though, as long as you bring cash and ask to have your orders put in at the same time (if you dont your food can come at sporadic intervals ranging from 515 minutes, and it sucks watching your friends eat).

Their sandwiches have never disappointed. Users/BrookeB

20090503 13:02:49 nbsp They have an awesome Eggs Benedict here.  And with avocado!  I was really surprised, but now Im just craving it all the time now. . . Users/CurlyGirl26

20090531 09:25:54 nbsp This is probably the first restaurant I actually went to and paid for on my own. Ive run through most of the menu over the years, and I cant think of a single time Ive been less than satisfied. Some of my favorites:
Chocolate walnut crepes... with strawberries is good, too, especially during the summer.
Florentine crepe. Simple and my definite favorite overall.
ANY of the eggs Benedict varieties. The sauce is perfect.
THE ORANGE JUICE. You wouldnt believe it. Its so rich that if youre used to drinking from concentrate you might need to water it down a little. Its the best Ive had anywhere.

Ive never had to wait long for my food and the staff is competent as much as you interact. I like having the selfserve water, so you dont have to sit around waiting for a refill.
 Users/KBathory

20090618 21:50:30 nbsp Ive eaten here a couple times a month for the past year, and the food has always been tasty and the service great.  Its one of my favorite places to eat in Davis.  The San Francisco Benedict is very good  it has steamed spinach in place of the meat, so its a little lighter on the cholesterol than regular eggs benedict.  The Hollandaise sauce is delicious.  : )

If youre planning to withdraw cash from an ATM to eat here, you might want to use your usual ATM instead of the one in the store.  It has a pretty high fee, I think $2.50.  Thats my only complaint. Users/DanaSullivan

20090630 13:58:57 nbsp Three days ago I was told by one of the current employees that in a drunk stupor (which is not an uncommon event, from what I understand) the owner of this establishment announced to her that he thinks Adolph Hitler was a good man. In my 5 years in Davis I have known countless young women who have worked for him; all of which have quit due to sexual harassment. My friend worked for him for several months  her work consisted of accompanying this married, middle aged gentlemen to poker games, both with his friends and privately, and drinking lots of wine. Theres some food for thought. I mean crap for thought. I mean crepe for thought... Users/Enosh
   I was told by... Yeah, yeah. And we need to know this hearsay because...? (I dare say secondhand rumors spin fast as fans with no dodo hitting them around the wiki these daze)Users/BrianJKenyon
  Dear Brian,
You do not need to hear, or read for that matter, anything. People log on to DavisWiki to research items about Davis (one such item being Crepeville). Most conscientious consumers would like to know whether the owner of a restaurant they eat at is a racist lecher. I pose the following challenge to you, the selfdelegated skeptic  Ask the owner yourself how he feels about Jews, OR creeping around Sofias Thai Kitchen Trivia Night in a trenchcoat on a weekly basis. Let me add, Brian, that I do believe the food at Crepeville is pretty good, the service is not exactly something to brag about, and the internet is fairly accessible. If you dont care about where your money is going, its an ok place.  Users/Enosh
   ...racist lecher...? Strong words. I wouldnt sling such strong words unless I had proof, and not just because ...Three days ago I was told by one of the current employees.... Otherwise you are just contributing hot air to the Daviswikis sinking credibility. Users/BrianJKenyon

20090704 16:08:47 nbsp I have no idea if what Enosh asserts in his comments are true.  But it does seem odd to me to determine whether or not to go to a restaurant based on the political views of the restaurants owner.  A good restaurant isnt one where the owner agrees with me.  Its one where I get a good meal at an appropriate price in an appropriate amount of time. Users/IDoNotExist

20090704 18:04:04 nbsp Dear IDoNotExist   I would agree with your thought if you meant the owner of a business was a Bush Supporter while you for Obama.   But antiSemitism isnt a political view, it is racism and hatred.  That kind of talk, unchecked, spreads hate and gets a lot of people killed; do not belittle antiSemitism or any other form of hate/racism as a political view. Users/AlanMiller

20090704 18:42:47 nbsp Racism, hatred, and antisemitism though despicable, are also protected free speech (and yes, they are also political views, even if you dont want to view them that way), just as your posting was also protected free speech.  (In fact, in some countries, they have been deeply ingrained in the political structure for years.)  Believe me, Ive seen the effects of these first hand, and in no way would I ever support them, nor was I making any sort of statement about their importance.  However, the hearsay reported views of a restaurant owner dont have anything do with the food.  Imagine if we boycotted any restaurant in Davis where someone created a wiki account and claimed that the owner of that place was racist or antisemitic or (place your favorite offensive view here).  You could destroy a restaurant, its reputation, and its business simply by making that unsubstantiated claim.  Ive eaten at Crepeville many times and never seen any evidence that would confirm Enoshs story.  I have seen many people saying nasty, unsubstantiated things about various business owners on the wiki.  Maybe some of them are true.  Maybe some of them come from disgruntled employees or unhappy customers or someone with some reason to make that sort of thing up.  As wiki readers, we really have no way to tell when you make such a claim, unless you provide proof that what you say is true.
 Users/IDoNotExist

20090705 17:07:44 nbsp Dear IDoNotExist  First of all, for the record, I do exist.

I fully agree with you about the dangers of Wikis in relation to businesses and reputations.  It is similar to a person publicly falsely accused of abusing their children, even if cleared of the charge, people will always wonder.  That is why I kept my comments strictly on your comment, not on the discussion or establishment.  This wiki experiment contains pitfalls that I believe will become more apparent as its use becomes more widespread and actual attempts to maliciously destroy a business actually result in damages.

In regard to my comment on your stand alone comment it does seem odd to me to determine whether or not to go to a restaurant based on the political views of the restaurants owner., I stand by my comment.  Users/AlanMiller


20090709 13:35:09 nbsp I used to love crepeville but I had the worst experience at there yesterday. Two friends and I went out for dinner. One friend ordered the tuna melt but asked if there were onions on it. Everything seemed to go well and our order was taken. Later, the waitress who took our order came to the table because apparently there were onions in the tuna melt. So my fiend had to make another order and she chose a burger instead. Later the asian waitress with long hair came out and told us that the burger would cost extra. When pressed she said that no, they could not take care of the extra cost despite their mistake. I wanted to leave right then but my friend agreed to pay the cost and she went away. She later came back and said the extra charge would be $1.80 and we seemed to agree that itd be fine if my friend paid later. When my food came out, another waitress (slightly redheaded with a sharp nose) came out and told us that the extra cost needed to be paid right then or else her food would not be served. (Count it that means we were interrupted no less than four times for their mistake.) When she went back to the other waitresses, they started talking shit about us. Classy. As if I couldnt see them 20 ft away making faces and looking our way.

Bottom Line: TERRIBLE SERVICE. we wont be going back again.

Manager(s), please discipline your staff. They were rude and unprofessional. Users/eryan

20090709 21:11:13 nbsp Love crepevilles chicken pesto sandwich. Delecious. And the older guy who busses the tables works his tail off. Users/jwendt

20090713 22:10:28 nbsp My omelets have always been good, but I have to admit, the chalk board menu is fantastic.  Users/patrick82

20090720 19:58:27 nbsp Great place for breakfast, decent for lunch, but somehow I was never thrilled about crepes for dinner. It is a pain in the ass that they dont take credit/atm, but the food isnt bad. Users/longboardlover

20090724 02:32:32 nbsp The Greek Delight crepe is truly a delight and the potatoes are to die for!!!  :)  Id also recommend the Fuji salad, its scrumptious!   Users/sm0729

20090725 19:10:25 nbsp The food is usually good here, although I took my parents here a couple days ago and my mom got a strawberry muffin and there was a hair in it. She went to the counter to ask for another one and once again there was a hair in that one. We got a refund, but they never pulled the other muffins, cause obviously there was something wrong with that batch.

Then when I got my coffee refilled, the waitress put too much in the cup because I needed room for cream, and she went to dump it back into the pot when thankfully another waiter told her to stop.

The bathrooms were also disgusting, not cleaned and very unsanitary.

These health code violations alone make me question the quality of food I am getting and think I will just go somewhere else in the future. The food is good, but not that great, unless you like hair in your food. Users/BrandonBarrette

20090827 12:16:15 nbsp I must admit that Crepeville has some of the best food in Davis. The California Crepe is my favorite and all of the fruit and nutella crepes are delicious. That is why it’s such a shame that the management/ownership is terrible. Like most customers, I am a student and I frequently go there to study. While I am there, I buy a full meal which consists of the California crepe with a salad instead of potatoes, a coffee, and sometimes a muffin. On average, my meal costs about $10$13. On several occasions, I have been asked to leave as soon as I have finished my meal. I don’t think this is right because I spend a significant amount of money on my meal and then I am forced to leave minutes after eating? And what’s up with the cash only policy? I have seen the owners cuss out their employees and I have also seen them creeping around Sofia’s with bloodshot eyes. I have lived in Davis for a while now and I have heard nothing but bad stories about the owners and management. I really hope the owners start to treat their employees with the respect that they deserve.  Users/SFNative2006

20090827 17:36:45 nbsp In response to Enosh/Brians comments, I am a former employee of Crepeville, and I know these things to be true about the owner. They treat their employees poorly and are all around bad people. You should care where your money is going, and if you want it to go to good people, I dont recommend going to this particular restaurant. Oh, and to Crepegirl, although Simon was at the restaurant a lot, I heard him say rude and often racist things on many, many occasions, especially about the girls who worked there. He was not the greatest manager, to say the least. Users/aotearoa36

20090903 16:51:01 nbsp I have never had something I did not enjoy there! love the hawaiian. Users/jdavis

20090912 22:09:46 nbsp Oh man, I had an amazing night. Took my boyfriend and his mom here and he had the Salsa and his Mom had the California(One of my favorites!) and I had the Savory Crepe with a Fuji Salad. Oh man, I got a FULL plate of salad with my crepe. Thank goodness his Mom helped me with half the salad, it was too good to be wasted! The food was really fresh and wellseasoned. We HAD to get a dessery crepe and got a Strawberry/Banana/Nutella Crepe. Even with a full appetite, we finished that plate too! :D  Users/MissAmyQ

20091028 13:49:45 nbsp Perfect place for any meal. The crepes are great, the omelets are great, the salads are great, so far I havent tried anything I didnt like. I never have to wait long for my order. The portions are huge and the prices are not bad. Just try it. Users/sjpacheco

20091108 20:27:07 nbsp this place is one of our favorite/most visited restaurants in davis. we are students with a low budget and massive appetites, and we leave with leftovers most of the time.

Best thing to order: basic crepe with no onions, cheddar cheese(comes with) cream cheese, tomato and avocado.... basically all we ever order. its a good amount of food for a decent price (we get two orders of that, plus a coke, for a meager $18) Users/mrandmrs

20091111 10:56:11 nbsp The acoustics in this room are horrible. The room is always loud and its difficult to hear the person across from you. the food, however, is wonderful. Take your order out to the patio or togo. Users/GJC02

20100116 20:21:14 nbsp Whats up with the fresh fruits? Every time Ive gotten those 1/2 are rotten. Otherwise the crepe, and everything else Ive tried  savory crepe, french toast (one of the best!), dessert crepe is great. Users/LeeY

20100129 16:00:51 nbsp People of Davis and visitors: WATCH OUT!  Beside the food being fairly overpriced and mediocre, the staff is dishonest as well.  I had the unfortunate event of paying for lunch for me and my sister, which turned out to be just under $20.  I handed the woman helping me a twenty as she turned around and then began getting our drinks, etc...  While waiting for my change, and our drinks she came back to the register and asked me to pay her!  What?  She then contended that I had not yet paid her!  To both myself and my sisters shock she demanded I pay her (AGAIN)!  When I asked to speak to a manager, and after a LONG argument, they told me they would review the security cameras to se what happened...well you can guess how that turned out, they never got back to me, and I should come back tomorrow.   Needless to say the way the situation was handled was dishonest and the staff made ME and my SISTER feel like the liars; it was AWFUL.  Please if you visit this place (especially if its busy) mark your bills or pay in all change (as its a cash only restaurant), maybe this may help you from facing the humiliating experience my sister and I had to go throughor just avoid this place all together! Users/rhestir

20100308 19:26:41 nbsp Used to be a huge fan of this place but not anymore. The service has gone downhill and the manager is extremely unpleasant. Last couple times that I ate there, I saw my exact order sitting up on the counter for about ten minutes while the incompetent staff stood around and gossiped. Crepeville what happened? The owners/managers need to hire and train better staff.  Users/SFNative2006

20100531 09:40:30 nbsp Does anyone else think the water here tastes like bleach? I usually try to bring my own waterbottle when I want to drink water, but I can also ask them for a pint glass.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20100605 20:38:53 nbsp The prices have gone up and I feel like the portions have gone down...makes you wonder why Crepeville is so empty compared to Burgers and Brew... Users/ArianeMetz
 And yet, its the same owners!   Users/CovertProfessor

20100613 01:37:01 nbsp ive only been here once but from what i see, they could make crepeville a buffet and it will still be not filling enough for me. the way they make their crepe is really thin so i could just vacuum it in my mouth and it feels like a fluffy cotton ball went into my stomach. its pretty pricey for me too, so i might come here when i get a date or something hehe :) Users/binladen

20100627 07:51:46 nbsp Ive been a Crepeville regular (way too regular!) for some years now.  I like the food and the setting, and can think of nothing more relaxing than drinking iced tea and reading while sitting at an outside table on a nice warm day.  However, the thing that impresses me most about the place is the staff.  I know nothing about the managements political views or labor relationships, but I do know that the guys and gals at Crepeville have been consistently cheerful and hardworking for at least the last couple of years.  I dimly recall a time when the crew was less enthusiastic and the turnover higher, but Ive been seeing the same welcoming faces for quite awhile now.  Somebody is doing something right there, because in my experience the service is great. Users/JimFrame

20100702 19:41:11 nbsp As a severe lactose intolerant, a trip to Crepeville is a rare treat. Word of warning, very little on the menu that doesnt have cheese in it... as if thats a bad thing! Hohoho!

Ive been in love with this place since it opened. The Florentine crepe is my goto when I really want some cheesy goodness (well, maybe second to animal fries, but you didnt hear it from me). Fresh spinach is my addiction and it feeds me well. I sometimes find the house potatoes to be a bit too salty for my taste but theyre perfectly edible with a bit of ketchup to cut the salt.

For dessert, my favorite up until recently was the chocolate crepe with walnuts. Oh. My. Goodness. None of that wimpy milk chocolate nonsense, this is rich, creamy, bittersweet chocolate and the crunch of toasty nuts and an enormous pile of whipped cream on the side to slather on each bite and be generally naughty with (my friends will recognize this reference, of course, as will anyone who has ever seen me down one of these beauties.)

However, in a bout of curiosity and nostalgia I recently ordered the blintz with applesauce and lemon sauce. Im a huge chocolate snob, I think no dessert is complete without it. Im also generally leery of fruity desserts, I generally find them to be too sweet and cloying.
This changed my mind.
I loved blintz as a child but couldnt stand peoples habit of smothering them in syrupy strawberries. Id have to go to the trouble every time of scraping that stuff off so I could taste the glorious, warm cheese.
The blintz here, however, was served hot and creamy in the middle of a pool of applesauce, a drizzle of honey lemon sauce (which on the other crepes I generally found to be too strong, but theres me and my snobbishness again) and a lovely, cold dollop of sour cream. It may sound like an odd combination to some of you conservative eaters out there, but all together its an experience of interplay between tangy lemon and cheese and cream with the slight sweetness of honey and apples. It may have beaten out my chocolate obsession.

Anyway, other plates of note include the benedicts and a hollandaise sauce that deserves an award, the salads which are a great pile of tastes and textures, the muffins (strawberry and chocolate when you can get them!), and of course how could I forget...

The best orange juice Ive ever had. I suggest you try it. :) Users/KBathory

20100705 18:50:19 nbsp Five dollars for A CREPE seems about 35% too much for such. Refusal to accept electronic payment always suggests tax evasion to me... not saving the already small margin etc. Good crepes. The restaurant seems overstaffed in the front to the extent that it will not help your order be processed or delivered to you any more quickly or more completely. Friendly staff, but not much interaction between back of house and front of house (which is fairly visible). I ordered a southwest scramble or something which came with breakfast potatoes that were red with fresh herbs. Plenty of avocado in my scramble, which I appreciate. Probably a first choice for breakfast food in this village.  Users/seesharp

20100716 17:44:35 nbsp Strawberry Nutella crepe all the way! Users/JasperD

20100721 00:28:56 nbsp My wife and I have lived in Davis for about three years now.  Weve tried numerous eateries.  This is tops on our list for a couple of reasons.  There is a surprisingly wide array of tasty options  including lots of selections for vegetarians (which we are).  It is quite affordable, especially considering the large portion sizes.  You can hang out and study for an hour or two and no one bothers you.  Sometimes we get a bit of that lingering guilt for hanging out too long... No worries here, grab a coffee and a pastry after dinner.  It buys another hour easily.  Finally, great service, informal atmosphere, and free wifi (with plugs throughout).  A+ Users/willwallace

20110124 22:52:15 nbsp good SF Benedict, pototo, sandwiches, and everything else. I love their menu selection. The only downside is that they take cashonly payment.  Users/kobe24

20110302 19:04:23 nbsp Best hangover cure ever! Roll out of bed and over to crepeville for a savory crepe or a sandwich. I usually get a sandwich/salad combo, and the potato wedges really hit the spot. I used to get the dessert crepes but the savory crepes are much better so dont waste your time. Delicious! Users/Lo17

20110330 12:37:11 nbsp I have loved Crepeville since I first moved to Davis as a freshman. I cannot say enough good things about their Fuji salad and all their other salads. They are just sooo good.

I recently tried their oatmeal and I was so disappointed. It was a huge bowl of tasteless watery thinrolled oats, the oatmeal it self was not even salted. The blueberries and raspberries on top looked great though. I took it back to the server and she looked appalled that someone had served that and got me a bowl of soup instead (which was very good). I think that it might have been so bad because I ordered it at night, but still I would never try their oatmeal again.    Users/DanielleC

20110617 15:33:46 nbsp Consistently good Eggs Benedict here. Its easy to mess up poaching an egg or preparing hollandaise sauce but they seem to get it right every time for around $7.00. I prefer the Midtown Benedict as I think avocado over ham is an easy decision. My complaint here is that I dont really like the Country Potatoes that come on the side and I think they should offer hashbrowns. That would make me happy.  Users/MikeyCrews

20110813 22:19:23 nbsp We love Crepeville food (especially the morning muffins) but yesterday when we ate there for dinner, we left a bit disappointed. The toppings in the Fuji Salad were nonexistent. All lettuce and not much else. Its also disappointing that you can no longer get a bagel with the 1/2 soup1/2 salad combo. The Pesto Crepe was tasty but also lean on the substance. Well still give them a try once in a while but other than the morning muffin, it might be more like a while in a once if this becomes a permanent change. Well need to look elsewhere to get value for our dinner dollar. Users/DebWestergaard

20111001 18:32:53 nbsp We had a savory crepe and a dessert crepe here; both were great. The ambience is also very cosy. Easy on the wallet too; about 10$ a person. Users/kijacker

20111116 20:49:58 nbsp They definitely do crepes right. However, be wary of their other menu items. They used to do a good Greek salad, but their menu description is no longer accurate; the one I got today consisted of iceberg lettuce (or maybe really particularly bland/watery romaine lettuce) ONLY (no mixed greens), a few slices of watery tomato, two slices of cucumber, feta cheese, and five kalamata olives. Disappointment! The dressing was good though, and the chicken pesto crepe and caramel apple crepe were AMAZING. The crepes were definitely worth coming back for. Service is also good. Users/gurglemeow

20120109 00:03:04 nbsp What happened to Crepeville? They changed their light natural wooden interior that corresponded so nicely to the atmosphere of the California sun shining through the high windows, the park across the street, and the light food to some ugly heavy artificial looking dark painted wood. And the stainless steel all around emits the atmosphere of a butcher shop rather than a light happy relaxed restaurant. I hope they dont pay their interior architect because he must have gotten paid already by their competitors. Users/bcschipper

20120123 17:48:01 nbsp It was just okay, nothing special.  My hamburger was average and the member of my party who had crepes was not impressed.  The staff was really friendly. Users/LoriOrf

20120220 20:21:20 nbsp The California and Florentine (sp?) crepes are the best. Im not too fond of the baked potatoes, though. Otherwise, this is a great place to eat.   Users/OliviaGlass

20120304 14:29:49 nbsp For the second time, I noticed
their portion size to their Country scramble and South of the Border dropped by half but still delicious.  The potatoes are no longer big sized chunks but rather smaller burnt crumby pieces.  I feel jipped with the to go orders...my fault for not checking before I leave but I feel they know most people wont go home and come back to complain.  Dine in is good but the quality of the potatoes have definity gone down over the last few years.

20121230 21:49:38 nbsp This place is great! I love the food and the coffee! But sometimes they do see to be a little rude when you place your order. Also try to avoid major lunch hours because it gets crazy in there and you could get lost in the shuffle! Users/AlexLN

20130102 21:51:13 nbsp One of Davis best restaurants in my opinion. The menu is surprisingly wide for such a hightraffic payoveratthecountereatery. Potatoes here are amazing, so are the omelette a and sweet crepes. Service differs from time to time, the food is always worth it. Users/LumosPortus
