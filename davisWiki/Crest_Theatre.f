The Crest Theatre is an independent Movies film house in Sacramento that also presents comedy shows, concerts and can be reserved for private events. The Crest provides Davis residents with an opportunity to see first run indie films. The theatres http://thecrest.com/calendar/calendar.cfm calendar is available on their website, as is a seating chart, and Tickets.com reservations.

The Crest was constructed in 1946 within the remaining shell of vaudeville theatre originally built in 1912. Planned as a movie house, its opening night was October 6, 1949 featured That Midnight Kiss from MGM Studios as well as its lead actors, Kathryn Grayson and Mario Lanza. Government officials included Governor Earl Warren and Belle Coolidge, Sacramentos first female mayor. For the next thirty years, The Crest continued to showcase films as well as concerts for such indie rockers as The Knitters, Black Flag and 7 Seconds until financial pressures forced it to close in late 1979. Local supporters banded together, including Linda McDonagh who successfully established The Palms on her farm in Davis. Together they successfully rallied to clean and reopen the venue on November 18, 1986 with the MGM musical Singin in the Rain and its star, Donald OConnor. Over the next decade, supporters worked hard to gather money and support to restore the theatre, and by 1995 the Crest received a one million dollar restoration to bring the old sparkle back to its art deco smile.

The Crest is also the host of the http://www.trashfilmorgy.com/ Trash Film Orgy, a yearly festival of late night cult camp and trash film.  A good place to see some strange and funny movies with a crowd of likeminded (a scary thought perhaps) folks.  There is usually a pricebreak for folks that show up in costume.

The theatre is right next to Pyramid Alehousea nice place to stop in before or after a show for some tasty food and beer and some of the best chicken wings in the region.

The outside marquee is very dramatic when lit at night. The interior is less impressive, not too much decorative flair. Their popcorn is pretty bad, I dont think its popped there. JamesDawe jd

 The main theater has is quite breathtaking, but they dont usually play movies in there due to its 900+ seating capacity.  It is used for live shows and film festivals, but not for the regular screenings.  Those are held in two small theaters in the basement that are unimpressive, although my wife did propose to me in one of them. RogerClark
