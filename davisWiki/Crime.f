Davis has a reputation as a safe community, but it is not without some crime. Besides Bicycling Tips bike theft (which is practically guaranteed to happen to unlocked bicycles bikes), the occasional violent crime, such as sexual assault, does occur.  Sacramento suffers from a poorer reputation in this regard, but things have been improving lately, especially around their Downtown area.  In early 2011, Davis experienced a rash of Catalytic Converter Theft.

Crime Prevention Tips: When you are not home hide your valuables! Check your locks on doors and windows and replace them with secure devices as necessary. Pushbutton locks on doorknobs are easy for burglars to open. Install deadbolt locks on all your outside doors. Sliding glass doors are vulnerable. Other windows may need better locks. Check with a locksmith or hardware store for alternatives. Make your home looks occupied, and make it difficult to break in. Leave your lights on even earlier mornings when you leave for work. Turn on your radio when you leave. Trim your shrubbery around your home to reduce cover for burglars. Be a good neighbor.

It identifies a person as a part of the Sikh community. No one is allowed to touch the turban. The turban is like a part of the body. It is personal space, sacred.  The significance of the turban evolved from the historical persecution of Sikhs by other religious groups. At one time, scalps of Sikhs could be sold for a reward.  It takes about 20 minutes to tie a turban. When tied correctly a turban is very secure. Knocking a turban off anothers head is extremely disrespectful.  Kevin McCarty has been accused of a hate crime as a result of the incident and a trial is underway.




20060208 17:44:04 nbsp There sure have been a lot of indecent exposure incidents in Davis lately. Or at least a lot of emails about them. Users/RoyWright

20060208 18:25:55 nbsp Roy, over the long term it doesnt feel like it is that out of the ordinary. It used to be that the UC Davis Police Department would print the crime announcement out and campus mail them. Now with email they get much better coverage. Users/JasonAller

Here is something I found while delving for other information, should probably go somewhere.

SUBJ: The Perils of Sheer Stupidity
Excerpted from The Davis (CA) Enterprise, Aug 3, 1997

A Davis man who allegedly stole another mans vehicle was arrested
Friday when he went to the car owners house and demanded his
personal items from the car.

David Joseph Carrozzo, 19, allegedly stole a 1986 Honda Civic on
July 18 from the Amtrak parking lot, 840 Second St. The owner
reported it missing the next day, and on July 20, a Davis police
officer found it at West Manor Park.

A teenage boy nearby admitted to knowing who had stolen the car, but
would not reveal the name, so the officer returned the car to the
owner.

Editors Note: Carol adds, In Davis, the town where snoring too
loudly can get you a citation for violating the noise ordinance,
the police have to let you go if you still wont talk after they say
pretty please with sugar on it. These guys apparently need to
spend more time with the LAPD. 

Then, on Friday, Carrozzo appeared at the owners house demanding
his property back. Instead, the owner called police, who arrested
Carrozzo on suspicion of stealing the car. He was lodged at Yolo
County Jail.

The teenager was also arrested, but police released him to his
father.

Does this go anywhere? ~Users/Davepoole

20080215 20:25:27 nbsp according to the latest readers digest (which cites http://ope.ed.gov/security a study done by the federal Office of Postsecondary Education) the university of california, davis has higher crime rates, in addition to being able to prepare more saying with the comment no chains or peepholes on dorm doors. i find it strange that they would even pick davis out of the handful they mentioned...is there really so much crime here?

20121207 13:04:26 nbsp Late yesterday afternoon, my housemate and I were walking back to our apt from the Safeway in North Davis when we nearly got mugged by someone. It happened behind the building lot with Jamba Juice. Fortunately, my housemate was more alert than I was and we ran back to the Marketplace where he stopped following us. The mugger was an African American male, Id say around 6 ft, 170180 lbs, and late 30searly 40s. He was wearing a backpack in a slouched manner (trying to blend in as a college student?). We did call the police and they dispatched a trooper to check the area, but even so, a heads up to anyone who might be taking a trip to the Marketplace anytime soon  especially if youre walking. I was surprised that it happened in North Davis, but I guess it can happen anywhere. Users/AmyXie
