Cristina would like you to know that....

3BEDROOM AVAILABLE!!!! IN AGGIE SQUARE APARTMENTS!!!

Alright, this is how it is:
I was supposed to be living with 4 other girls and decided to sign a lease around March. Due to some financial crises I can no longer attend Davis and, therefore no longer need the apartment because the other girls cant really afford it on their own.  I then find out I STILL have to pay for next year even though i signed the release of lease. i was the only one available and/or of age to sign the lease so I (stupidly) did and if I dont find new renters I, alone, have to pay rent starting september.
PLEASE, IF YOU WANT A THREE (3!) BEDROOM APARTMENT GO TO AGGIE SQUARE APARTMENTS!

Know anyone who still needs an apartment?  Contact Cristina @ ?
