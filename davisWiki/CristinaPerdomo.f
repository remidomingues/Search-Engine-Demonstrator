Describe CristinaPerdomo here.

Just cruising around Davis for a couple of years. I already got my first $125 bail for not stopping at a stop sign on Sycamore lane while riding my bicycle. Make sure you stop at every stop sign when riding your bicycle.  I like the Nugget, Mondavi Center, Little Prague, The Hobby Craft, KDVS, Tap Water Davis Water with tons of lemon.
