Critical Mass reboot, just in time for spring. Next ride is Friday April, 26th 2013 at 5:30pm; ride starts at 6pm.

On the last Friday of each month, cycleminded folks from Davis meet at Central Park and subsequently swarm the Navigating Davis streets on their bicycles legpowered twowheelers. They used to meet at the Oak tree in Central Park.  Folks decide the route while en route, so feel free to ride with us and pick it. During the summer, the mass sometimes goes pool hopping, which occurred in July 2006 and 2007.

Critical Mass is the name for this phenomena which occurs in more than 300 cities around the world  see the wiki http://criticalmass.wikia.com/.  Given the love this city has for the bicycle, it is no wonder that it should occur here. There used to be an email list (MailTo(criticalmassdaviscasubscribe@googlegroups.com)) for Davis info. For those Facebook addicts out there, there is a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2233882529 Davis Critical Mass Facebook group that is still active.

Larger, lesslocal Critical Mass events are held in Berkeley and San Francisco, where the cyclists come out in the thousands. The September 28th San Francisco Critical Mass http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?file/c/a/2007/09/28/MNP6SFGLQ.DTL&typeprintable marked the 15th birthday of the movement.

See Bicycling Advocacy for other bikerelated events.

 A Vision Statement 



Critical Mass is about envisioning (and for a small moment, creating) a world where bikes are the dominant mode of travel.  By riding en mass we create an experiential space for both cyclists and the wider community to see what a world full of bikes looks and feels like.  When more people ride bicycles it means less congestion for those still in automobiles, safer and quieter streets for children and the elderly, less taxes needed for new road construction, less pollution and climate change, a healthier and more fit population, more community interaction, reduced urban sprawl, and reduced reliance on foreign oil.

Davis is already a very bicycle friendly city (14% of Davis residents bike to work), but our city could become even better.  We have the greatest potential out of any community in the whole country to reduce our traffic fatalities to zero by reducing the probability of fast heavy cars colliding with people or bicyclists.  This can be done a number of ways: slowing down cars where they mix with pedestrians and bikes, separating them completely using bike and pedestrian paths, and increasing the proportion of walking and cycling such that there are fewer cars to collide with.

One obvious way to encourage more bicycling is to make it easier to ride by improving the connectivity of bicycling infrastructure.  In Davis, one key piece of infrastructure is missing—a safe east west corridor. Fifth Street lacks a safe bike route between A Street and L Street.  Russell Boulevard lacks bike lanes entirely.   Our forward thinking city council has almost approved a “road diet,” conversion of one lane in each direction of fifth street to a bike lane. All they need is a little encouragement. Even the Downtown Business Association has endorsed the road diet.

There are many other steps that can be taken to encourage bicycling in Davis.  Stop signs should be yield signs for bicyclists, businesses should provide covered bicycle parking, yard waste should stay out of bike lanes, and downtown should be a carfree zone one Sunday a month so people can experience what such a space feels like in Davis.  The university can also encourage cycling.  The “car free campus” has sprouted a large number of trucks in the last two decades and can become a safer place by becoming car free once again.  Unitrans should join the ranks of most municipal bus services by providing bike racks or bike trailer services for its riders.

 Suggested Dos and Donts 

  Original list from http://lipmagazine.org/ccarlsson/archives/2006/02/critical_mass_f.html Chris Carlssons blog

 Do 

  Talk to strangers, bystanders, bus riders, motorists.
  Welcome people to join us next time.
  Help cars stuck in mass to exit to the right.
  Stop regularly if youre in front (no matter how slowly you think youre going, gaps are opening up behind you).
  Stop at red lights when in front to allow the rest of the ride to mass up behind.
  Keep going in dense packs through red lights to stick together and keep it safe for everyone.
  Fill gaps; Critical Mass depends on bicycle density to displace cars.
  Remember that pleasure and friendliness are more subversive than anger and blaming.

 Dont 

  Race ahead to block cross traffic before the Mass has arrived.
  Ride into oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the road.
  Pick fights with motorists, even (especially) if theyre itching for one.
  Fail to turn and twist through the city to make the ride more interesting.
  Forget to smile and wave and talk to strangers.
  Imagine that you are morally superior just cuz youre on a bicycle (youll be in a car again soon enough).
  Hesitate to tell other Massers what you think of their behavior, whether good or bad. Talk to each other.
  Forget we are all responsible to make Critical Mass what we want it to be.
  Mass up in turn lanes when you arent going to turn in that direction.
  Use lanes that arent necessary. If there are multiple lanes, let faster moving traffic pass on your left and dont block them.

The Law and Critical Mass:

California Vehicle Code 21202 (a) Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that time shall ride as close as practicable to the righthand curb or edge of the roadway except under any of the following situations: (1) When overtaking and passing another bicycle or vehicle proceeding in the same direction. (2) When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway. (3) When reasonably necessary to avoid conditions (including, but not limited to, fixed or moving objects, vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or substandard width lanes) that make it unsafe to continue along the righthand curb or edge, subject to the provisions of Section 21656. For purposes of this section, a substandard width lane is a lane that is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane. (4) When approaching a place where a right turn is authorized. (b) Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway of a highway, which highway carries traffic in one direction only and has two or more marked traffic lanes, may ride as near the lefthand curb or edge of that roadway as practicable.

California Vehicle Code 21208 a) Whenever a bicycle lane has been established on a roadway, any person operating a bicycle upon the roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction shall ride in the bicycle lane, except under the following situations.
   1. When overtaking or passing another bicycle, vehicle, or pedestrian within the lane or about to enter the lane if such overtaking and passing cannot be done safely within the lane.
   2. When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.
   3. When necessary to leave the lane to avoid debris or other hazardous conditions.
b) No operator of a bicycle shall leave a bicycle lane until it can be done safely and then only after giving an appropriate hand signal in the event that any vehicle might be affected by the movement.

 Avoiding Mass Arrests 

In the late 90s (citation needed), on the second critical mass organized, the Davis Swat was called. A perimeter was marked off, a trap was set, and mass arrests were made with fines imposed.  According to Users/SteveDavison who was there, it was a bloodbath, so much so that he is afraid to go on any other ones. However, the police havent cracked down on the mass in awhile and recent comments by the police chief could possibly be interpreted as tacit approval.

Halloween Ride!!!  Costumes!!!  Accordians!!!


June 2006

This June ride involved poolhopping! The first mass dip into a pool was at someones house...we had permission to use their pool, of course. The subsequent two or three pools into which we jumped were those of apartment complexes along our route. We didnt have official permission to use these pools, but we didnt get any complaints from apartment dwellers or management! We just had a lot of fun. Mustve been a seven to ninemile ride or thereabouts?

 Fliers 


20060214 11:01:09 nbsp I think this is a cool idea, but really people have to be more responsible with it.  I saw it go by downtown a few weeks back, and not only were the riders blowing stop signs, but two or three almost got hit.  Im pretty sure the idea is to create a massive group of bikers, not to endanger the lives of yourself and others. Users/PatrickProctor

20060308 13:25:32 nbsp We tried this back in the late 90s about 50 of us met in Central Park and road down Russel. Blvd to Anderson. After Anderson we made a U turn and headed back down town. Before we got to B St. we were swarmed by cops. On the way we blocked off several streets, and ticked off many, many drivers. One rider was intentionally hit, fortunately at a slow speed and several people were arrested. The Davis Cops were not amused and came down on us hard with pretty much the whole police force. There was little enthusiasm from participants for a repeat the activity.  Users/ColinWalsh

20060308 13:42:55 nbsp How stupid and annoying Users/JoshFernandez

20060313 20:36:47 nbsp I think drunks & cars are stupid and annoying. Users/PxlAted

20060319 15:50:59 nbsp Dont forget to come out and be stupid and annoying again in two weeks on the 31st... I expect to see you all there. Users/GarrettGallegos

20060328 16:58:44 nbsp I saw the words Critical Mass and thought about nuclear reactors ... embarrassed Users/TusharRawat

20060424 16:06:47 nbsp Photos Above are from Feburarys Critical Mass...Remember Critical Mass is happening this Friday!!! Users/NicholaiLinesch

20060503 23:35:06 nbsp April Critical Mass we had a motorcycle cop escorting us through intersections on the ride. Quite a different response from cops photographing us and threatening us with conspiricy... Users/PxlAted

20060508 20:07:36 nbsp Whether you completely understand what the point Critical Mass excatly is, or not.  I definately recommend giving it a try and really experience davis.   Users/KyleLanderhoffis

20060628 22:59:55 nbsp I mostly just consider it an excuse to get outdoors and interact with real people... Users/MistressAlthaea

So does anyone know how Pixel is?  I heard he lost three teeth.  Users/TobinJones

20060731 15:39:08 nbsp Towards the end of the ride I crashed on my bike going really slow and somehow ended up with the bike crashing down on my front teeth while I was laying on the gravel, thus dislodging two teeth and chipping another. At the hospital they fixed me up nice, replacing my teeth, sewing my gums back together, and holding them all in place with a metal wire and glue. Plus, I got some vicadin ran out!, AND its a great opportunity to quit smoking, so all in all Im doing just fine. Users/PxlAted

I feel that the police plan is a little off course. I dont want to say what the mass needs or doesnt need, because no one has that right in the zerocracy that the mass is, however, the police plan is a plan and that works against the idea of the mass just occurring and rolling wherever. No routes, no plans, just a happening. And as for the cops, let them do their thing. The mass is not wrong, people see it as wrong because they view their automobiles as superior, but we see each other as equals. Possibly therell be the masser(s) getting out of line, in which others should step up and ask them not to affect the celebration, but dont act like youre doing something wrong when the cops show. Were not doing anything wrong and we should stand by that, not flee.  Bentaylor
  What you say appears to make sense in a highly theoretical sense.  But cops dont care if you think you are doing anything wrong.  They may still baton, air gun, and arrest you and hold you in a jail cell over the weekend.  They may still charge you with a crime and result in you having to pay expensive lawyer fees to get out of it or worse yet  not paying enough and being wrongly tried and convicted of something that you are so confident is correct.  Get real  if the party in South Davis that was tear gassed last year tells you anything  its that the police in Davis clearly violate civil liberties and love to overreact to nonissues.  They issue tickets for people not having the right bike lights or having the wrong color turn signals or not wearing their seat belt, or not using a crosswalk.  Planning to do nothing and pretending that everything will be OK if the police set up a trap (as they have done) and that the police will be like Oh, well right  sorry sir  didnt know your philosophy on the transit system.  I have never taken that perspective before.  Have a good day! is complete and utter nonsense.  Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

20060824 10:50:28 nbsp There are many steps that can be taken to ensure that the cops dont show up in the first place. In the Late 90s we didnt have the current defination of CVC 21202 which allows us to take up the entire right lane on streets such as 5th street. If we annoy people by blocking the entire road than people will call the cops, and then the cops will show up. Less annoyance  less cops.  Another tactic is to change juristictions of which we have two in town, the city and the University. Users/PxlAted

20061126 12:59:20 nbsp miss riding with all of you. keep it FUNky. Users/PxlAted

20070129 16:28:10 nbsp Ive always had a great time doing this. Ive been forgetting lately, but I want to start coming again. My favorite experience was when I was walking along the quad, having forgotten that it was happening, when the pack rushed by. Users/ArlenAbraham Arlen was on his twoseater, and yelled, Brian, hop on! And so I did. I love spontaneity. Users/BrianAng

I disagree that we should always disperse at the first sign of cops.  Are we serious about stopping the rat race and global warming, or are we just screwing around?  If we have someone bring a camera, we can deter the cops from mass arrests.  Users/TobinJones

20070427 18:48:47 nbsp I saw the mass twice today, Once headed West down Fifth, and then again headed west on 2nd between F and E. At the second site I managed to give a YEAAAAAAAH CRITICAL MASS and I also saw the mobile bike church and was able to give a YEAH MOBILE BIKE CHURRRCH as well. The yelling comes in the spirit of the way I yell at village cabs YEAAHH village cabs⁄! Users/StevenDaubert

20070525 18:15:14 nbsp This makes me so furious. You want to make a difference in cycling rights?  Bike to work every day, obey traffic laws, and support politicians who support cyclists.  I know this isnt as much fun as being a beretwearing anarchist like TobinJones, but it may actually have a positive impact on the world.  As opposed to this B.S., which only infuriates the people whose minds youre trying to change. Users/BillyBudd
 Users/WilliamLewis I, for one, obey traffic laws when I ride critical mass. Perhaps you should read up on them.
 I, for two, obey traffic laws when I ride Critical Mass. However, Ive never ridden Critical Mass, so thats not saying much. I hear, however, that the traffic laws makes for some great literature. A real pager turner! My favorite is section 21208. Users/KaiTing Kai

20070525 19:27:43 nbsp May 25, 2007. Lots o people attended mass. HELL YES. Ride on! Users/EliseKane

20070528 22:58:17 nbsp hiya. So who has pics from this past ride? If anyone has some shots, lets see them posted. Cant wait to see em! Users/EliseKane

20070629 22:00:49 nbsp In SF, the cops cork the intersections for us! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070722 15:58:02 nbsp Fifth street HAS a safe bike route from A to L streets.  It is called THIRD street and EIGHTH street.  The trucks get one good road to barrel down which keeps them off of the two roads that have bike lanes that we can fly down more safely.  If Fifth (the only carfriendly road south of Covell) is converted to an 8thst.like mixed use, then the trucks and fast cars will spread out to all the roads we bicyclists use and make them less safe for us.   NotTires Users/NotTires
 Since when are trucks barreling thru davis a good idea on anything other than the freeways? humans need to slow the fuck down. how about a car free street in Downtown? sounds cool to me... benches and trees and people, oh my. Users/PxlAted

20070928 19:57:31 nbsp Ok, todays mass was awesome! I had such a good time. Seeing everyone dance in the middle of the quad during the freshman welcome was funny. Congratulations on having a successful mass. Users/JessicaRockwell

20070929 01:03:34 nbsp We honked at you guys when you were going down Anderson! The HUGE crowd of zombies and pirates made my day :D Users/KellyCorcoran

20080328 17:05:41 nbsp What path do you guys take?  I like to get my customers to support you outside my store, but never know when you guys will pass by or if at all.  Its 5pm now and Im anticipating... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

 Edit: Nevermind.  I ended up seeing them on G Street at around 6:30pm.  Not as big as it was in January, but still a decent size.

20100223 09:57:06 nbsp Strongly agree with PatrickProctor;

Strongly encourage involvement at USA Cycling Events.

Worse than motorists, these fers think they should be able to charge cyclists for, AND prohibit those who do not pay from, using the public roads.

Please pass the word to other CMs and individuals who would like to participate in group rides w/o paying.
