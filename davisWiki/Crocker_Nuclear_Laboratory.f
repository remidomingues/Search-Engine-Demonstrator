Crocker Nuclear Laboratory (CNL) is named for (wiki:wikipedia:William H. Crocker William H. Crocker) 18611937 and is home to a 76inch isochronous wiki:WikiPedia:Cyclotron cyclotron. It was built in 1965. A member of the wellknown Crocker family of Northern California and founder of wiki:wikipedia:Crocker National Bank Crocker National Bank, W.H. Crocker sat on the UC Board of Regents for nearly thirty years and funded the http://www.lbl.gov/ Lawrence Radiation Laboratorys second cyclotron. UC Davis particle accelerator is primarily used for air quality research, radiation effects on electronic systems used in space missions and the treatment of occular melanoma.

Address(Crocker Lab, 38.536436, 121.752593) is one of the few labs in the nation with a http://www.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/intraocularmelanoma/healthprofessional Retinal Melanoma treatment facility. They boast a near 100% success rate in treating this particularly virulent form of cancer (http://www.lbl.gov/ScienceArticles/Archive/eyecancerclinic.html link to article). The lab was also used in analysis of such historical documents as the wiki:WikiPedia:Gutenberg Bible Gutenberg Bible and the http://www.isidoreofseville.com/vinland/ Vinland Map. (Though, considering the map turned out to be a fake, I guess its not really a historical document) The current director of the lab is http://mae.ucdavis.edu/wexler/ Dr. Anthony Wexler.  http://lawr.ucdavis.edu/directory_facultypages.php?id8 Dr. Robert Flocchini was the prior director.

For Crocker Nuclear Laborartorys 40th aniversery Andy Fell wrote a spotlight article called Crocker Nuclear Lab at 40. Its four sub articles are, History: a legacy from Berkeley, What is a cyclotron?, Project Clean Air to the rescue, and Cyclotron applications. It can be viewed on the UC Davis website http://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/0706/crocker_nuclear_lab.html here.

Ill buy ice cream for anyone who can spot the error they made in the eighth paragraph.  Users/JesseSingh

  Save the ice cream for someone who finds an article without an error. There are no organic elements just organic molecules and compounds and so on  Users/JasonAller

  Wow, I should have asked you guys to proofread my article before it went in...thanks for catching that, you are careful readers.  Users/CristinaDeptula

    We got a kick out of the article here at the lab. Good job. Actually the error I mentioned wasnt the organic elements reference. Its that nitrogen cannot be detected using the method described in paragraph 8. But, I think, other than a couple of researchers at the lab, nobody else noticed. ;)   Users/JesseSingh
