20080126 23:46:56 nbsp Something that has seemed to work for some businesses is to archive older comments rather than just http://daviswiki.org/Soap_City_Laundromat?actiondiff&version225&version124 deleting them. Generally this has been done in case of a change of management or other significant event. It has also been done in cases where there were many comments and they dominated the page. If you want to make a comment archive for Soap City Laundromat you can either do it yourself or leave information here about when it came under new management. Users/JasonAller
