 CrossFit in 100 Words 
Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pullups, dips, rope climb, pushups, situps, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.

 Getting Started at CrossFit Davis 
Training at CrossFit Davis starts with an INTRO session and / or in their On Ramp Program. The Intro Sessions are by appointment only  call to schedule at (530) 7572460 or http://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid5909&stype9 schedule one online. The On Ramp program is for people without orthopedic issues and consists of 12 hour long classes spread over 4 weeks. The On Ramp classes meet M W & TH but have been known to switch up.

The Intro Session is a complimentary oneonone training session that lasts for about an hour. Its a back and forth conversation that is used to identify potential members goals, issues and expectations and answers any questions about CrossFit or CrossFit Davis. Potential members also get to experience a short CrossFit workout themselves which includes a row, squats, situps and pullups. They warm you up by going through all the movements and then get you going on the workout. If theres something you cant do or have trouble with you can do a modified version of the movement. For example, not a lot of people can do pullups initially, so they employ big rubber bands that provide varying degrees of assistance depending on their thickness. Depending on your level of fitness, this short workout can be really hard. That said, it is selfpaced.

Everyone goes through the Intro Session or On Ramp, even experienced CrossFitters. After the intro or On Ramp program, you can choose one of several membership options.

The cost for the On Ramp Program is $150 (12 hour long small group sessions with one or two coaches)

15 % discounts for law / fire and military personnel and students.

They also offer a Quickstart Package of 3 hour long personal training sessions and a month of unlimited membership for $300 (single) / $450 (couple). Clients that just missed an On Ramp Class start date or that want more personalized instruction generally choose this option.  As with the On Ramp Program, clients spend the time learning the movements used in CrossFit and getting acclimated to the the workouts. Quite literally, the coaches are looking ramp you up to transition into their group classes.

Personal Training is available to members and non members alike with rates starting at $69 per hour with discounts for couples, small groups and multisession packages. For example, 8 sessions purchased up front cost: $474 and 16 sessions costs $864

20090609 17:09:14 nbsp I joined CrossFit when it first opened as a total newbie. It has only been a couple months and I have already seen huge improvements in my endurance and strength. It is a real welcoming atmosphere and the coaches help motivate and push you. If you are looking for a challenging yet fun workout I highly recommend joining CrossFit Davis. Users/hatherley

20110109 11:31:40 nbsp I have been doing CrossFit for about seven months, and I have to say it has been well worth the time spent. Its not just about working out mindlessly, trying to look good in a swimsuit but actually developing good habits (such as what to do outside of the gym) and building some serious endurance and muscle too, of course. For me, working out in classes not only pushes me harder but also gives me the chance to meet others as well as getting to know the coaches on a personal level. The atmosphere is electric, and never once have I felt out of place. The coaches are knowledgeable and always give sound, practical advice on how to work out junk (that annoying tight spot in your butt/back/shoulder/etc). There is no reason not to come in and ask questions to get a feel for yourself. Users/gday

20110109 12:19:39 nbsp I have been doing CrossFit for about 14 months, and cant imagine NOT having it be the way I work out! I came from a competitive athletic background and was looking for something to match the challenge, intensity, and camraderie I sorely missed from my college days.  I found that at Crossfit, but I also found an amazing community of diverse ages, professions, athletic backgrounds (or lack thereof!).  You dont have to have any athletic experience to join and reap the benefits of Crossift just bring a positive attitude and a desire to work hard (and have fun). Users/msc2027

20110109 19:58:44 nbsp If youre looking for a fun, challenging workout surrounded by fellow fitness enthusiasts and guided by knowledgeable coaches, look no further than Crossfit Davis. The atmosphere at the gym is unlike any other Ive experienced. This is not your typical globo gym where youll find people trodding along on treadmills while reading Newsweek. Here youll find them grimacing as they try to crank out one more rep of some challenging Olympic lift, tossing around weights as easily as they toss around exotic terms like snatch and clean and jerk  but while this might sound intimidating, the gym members and coaches are extremely friendly and welcoming. Theres a sense of goodnatured competition at all levels, which drives everyone to do their best  and there are always new goals to be found once the old ones become commonplace. The diversity of exercises is a big part of the appeal  in a typical week (if there is such a thing) you might do some deadlifts, some rowing on the Concept 2 ergometer, run a few 400s, do a bunch of bodyweight movements like pushups, pullups, situps, jumping rope, and top it off by picking up some heavy weights. And thats might be just one or two workouts. If it sounds a bit extreme, it can be, and theres no shortage of impressive athletes around to inspire you  but the exercises can be scaled for all levels and the coaches will provide expert guidance in that regard, as well as instruction on form and safety.

20110110 16:52:23 nbsp No rows of machines, no mirrors, just results. As precisely as I can put it, thats what CrossFit Davis delivers. From the very moment you step in the door, youll notice the difference. Great people, hard work, REAL and varied training, and above all, great relationshipseverything you wish your local gym had, and more. Knowledgeable coaches will guide you step by step through the movements and the workouts, provide encouragement to track your progress (and you WILL progress), and never stop challenging you to do better. CrossFit is suitable and accessible to anyone, regardless of athletic ability or experience, and one of the most rewarding experiences you could ever have.  Users/JoCr

I have to admit, as a 50yearold woman, Crossfit was a bit intimidatingespecially when you get there and most people are half your age!
But I just LOVE this place!  I took the On ramp class (a four week intro to Crossfit course) and have just transitioned to the big kid class  The intro course was fantasticit did help get you up to the shape you need to be, but most importantly, you learned how to do most of the exercises/lifts SAFELY.  Further, it really helped me improve my confidence, which is the number one thing that holds me back!
It is expensive, but it seems to be in line with every other place.  It costs more than the gym because you GET more than the gym.
If you love novelty and the idea of reading a magazine on an elliptical trainer doesnt appeal to you, give Crossfit a try!
I have found EVERY coach to be encouraging and supportiveand they also push you to the next level.  I can be timid, and Im already seeing that I have to get over myself.  :)  Its working!

Ive been to many local gyms and find it disgusting watching some people strut their stuff like peacocks.  So far Ive seen NONE of that. In fact, I found that other members to be amazingly encouraging.
Im really trying to think of a negativeand I cant!  (Well, maybe a 5am class would be nice for me!)
