The Address(CrossCultural Center, 38.540840876864, 121.747917450963), also known as the CCC, offers culturally specific services and education, including student interns, programs and workshops. The Center serves as a community center for the students, faculty and staff at UC Davis. It provides a safe space for community members to explore themselves as well as learn about other races and cultures. We also have for public use an extensive library of reading materials by faculty and noted authors in the area of multiculturalism.  Everyone is welcome at the CCC. Volunteer Opportunities Volunteer opportunities are also available.

The CrossCultural Center was located on the corner of Shields and East The Quad Quad, across from Olson Hall Olson. As of January 9, 2012, it is now in the Student Community Center. The center plans campus events and programs which promote diversity and cross cultural education. They are open from 10am to 8pm Monday through Thursday and 9am to 5pm on Fridays. We invite you to make use of our library, art lounge, P.E.A.C.E. lounge, and conference room at the new center inside the Student Community Center.

The Center opened in the Fall of 1992 after a twoyear planning process. The creation of the center came about after a hunger strike in 1990 by 4 students, Ms. Ahmanal Dorsey from the African American Student Union, Mr. Jose Quinones from MEChA, Mr. Gopal Dayaneni and Ms. Andrea Gaytan. The center was one on a list of agreements the University committed to in reaction to the strike. A photo of the hunger strikers sits above the door to the office of the director of the Cross Cultural Center.
