Cross Platform Repair offers Computer Repair for any brand of computer (HP, Dell, Apple, etc.) running Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems that promises fast repairs. Services include onsite and pickup repair. Diagnosis fees are applied towards the repair cost. Also, repairs are billed for a fixed fee agreed upon before the repair rather than an hourly rate. If the problem isnt fixed, they dont charge you.


  See the Computers and Electronics entry for businesses that sell computers, or the Computer Repair entry for help when they break.
