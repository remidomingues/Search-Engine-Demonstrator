About Us
Spiritual in nature, the Crossings band formed in 2004 seeking to express their journey of faith musically. The band founded a Crossings alternative worship worship service at Davis Lutheran Church to be a more open space to explore issues of faith. Not long after forming, Crossings reached out to other musicians in Davis. They began what they call http://www.davislc.org/MusicSpiritJams%26Outreach/MusicSpiritJams%26Outreach.html Spirit Jams open to any and all musicians who love jamming. They also played with the Gospel Choir UC Davis Gospel Choir and performed on Nexus Stage (DCTV DCTV, channel 15).

Most recently, Crossings is excited to be part of the Davis Music Coop.
