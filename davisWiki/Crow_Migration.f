Midway through fall quarter there is a massive influx of crows.  Thousands upon thousands of these birds come to roost, brood, and defecate upon the property and population of Davis.

The species of crow that youll find in Davis is the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos).  Crows live in a group called a murder. wiki:WikiPedia:Ravens, which are in the same family (Corvidae) and genus (Corvus) as wiki:WikiPedia:Crow crows, look similar but are much larger. Crows are louder, have a harsh caw sound, and are more nervous. When flying, crows flap and yap. Ravens are quieter and are more calm. When ravens fly, they spend their time quietly soaring.

Contrary to public belief, crow meat actually tastes similar to the meat of other similarlysized birds. The phrase eat crow has more to do with their association with morbidity due to their black color, harsh caw vs. a song, and scavenger nature. For further information, http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Corvus_brachyrhynchos.html look here.

Crows are considered one of the most intelligent animal species on the planet due to their ability to create and use tools and their powerful memory. Some studies show that crows can count to 16 and recognize individual humans based on facial features. In Davis its pretty common to see Crows placing nuts in the road and waiting for cars to run them over, thus releasing the delicious content and demonstrating a high level of problem solving aptitude.

During late Spring and early Summer you may come across a fledgling crow that has recently left its nest. Theyre unable to fly at this point and appear generally helpless. Many are tempted to intervene and help the fledgling but you should resist the urge so long as the bird is not in immediate danger from cars or domestic animals. The parent crows are generally nearby at this stage and the fledglings are best left in the care of their parents.

Parking Parking spaces, primarily along Russell, are intensely coveted. Automobiles Car owners hold on to these spots ferociously.  Consequently, you can see many cars completely covered in Birds and Bird Watching bird excrement.  The absence of predators (coupled with an abundance of things to scavenge) allows the crows to rule the daytime Davis Skies Davis skies with impunity.

At night, what you think are crows may well be the local Davis Bats bats. The town is filled with many different types of Davis Wildlife.


A nest of crows near Hutchison Hall Hutchison were found dead circa July 2005. A specimen was sent to be tested for possible west nile virus infection as of 20050708.

If you see dead birds, report to http://westnile.ca.gov/bird_report_id.htm and/or http://townsend.ucdavis.edu/reportadeadbird/ , a lab at UC Davis that works alongside the West Nile group.

The crow problem used to be so bad at University Mall in the late 90s and early 2000s that they set up speakers to play the sound of predatory birds in order to scare away the crows.

On the evening of November 7th, 2005, there was a large crow population circling around the Davis Skies Davis sky.

 


 



20070512 23:13:45 nbsp I will always remember my first year at Davis. The Skies skies darkened from thousands of crows filling the sky. The noise was deafening. It was like an evil plague sweeping across the land. Then I saw a crow close up and realized that he had kind of a cool walk with his head bobbing back and forth. So every Halloween I always think about putting up a fake crow. Users/Jedron

20070620 22:34:03 nbsp A few years in a row, Ive noticed that hundreds, if not thousands of crows will gather in the fields where the West Village is slated to be built.  They walk or stand around, cawing at each other in the way that crows will.  Its really something to see.  Theres also a giant tree in front of the county courthouse in Woodland where hundreds will gather and raise a ruckus for several nights at a time...you know, like at a noisy, crowded bar where you have to shout So whats your sign? to be heard.

20070621 11:48:25 nbsp The crows will also swarm predators, Ive seen them attacking owls and other raptors. They even circled over my backyard due to all its awesome fruits and veggies, but I had a broomstick and I belive they thought it to be a gun, eventually they forgot what they were doing and drifted off and then dispersed.

20080316 09:57:29 nbsp My wildlife parasitology professor told me that the University tried to introduce a disease into the crow population. As you can see, their attempt at reducing the crow population failed. Users/EmilyTung

20080316 10:38:59 nbsp An ornithologist told me years ago that 30  40% of the regional crow population is residential, not migratory. You will see them heading in from the fields toward various groups of tall trees on evenings during nearly any time of year, with significant increases in the populations in the fall. There have been large populations in Yuba City and other valley communities, and it seems they are on the increase in the Bay Area as well: http://www.redwoodcitydailynews.com/article/20071122112207bilpaul Users/DonShor
