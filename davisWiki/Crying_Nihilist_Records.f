A record label that exists as little more than a http://www.cryingnihilistrecords.com domain name. Users/JeyKottalam Jey will take any suggestions for what to do with it, so just message him if you have any ideas at all.

Currently the only release under the Crying Nihilist Records label has been Lie Ability, a 79 minute documentary about a prank in which Users/JeyKottalams car is stolen in retaliation for an earlier serious prank.
