Describe Users/CrystalWalker here.


20100513 23:20:20 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  You might not realize that everyone can see all of the edits that you made. They can see that you made up a comment and edited comments to say things other than what their original authors said.  This practice is highly frowned upon.  Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  It will give you helpful suggestions for how to edit wiki pages without clashing with established wiki norms. Users/CovertProfessor

20100513 23:20:50 nbsp FYI, http://daviswiki.org/Lasting_Impressions_Hair_Design?actiondiff&version254&version152 every little change anyone makes to a page is recorded. Govern your editing accordingly. Users/WilliamLewis

20100513 23:31:35 nbsp Oh, and everyone can also see that you http://daviswiki.org/Users/CrystalWalker?actiondiff&version21&version10 have already been told this all before.  So, why did you do it again?  Did you think youd get away with it the second time?  Do you realize how Shadiness Factor shady you are making this business look? Users/CovertProfessor

20100513 23:57:28 nbsp You should think before you speak out of turn like that. Your judgmental and self righteous attitude is off putting. Users/CrystalWalker

20100514 01:24:53 nbsp With all due respect Crystal, you were making shady edits before CovertProfessor even posted a comment to you.  You had changed other peoples comments on the Lasting Impressions Salon page.  Hed tried to change them back but you did it some more.  Its pretty easy to see.  Just go to the Recent Changes tab and scroll down to the see your name attached to the edits. Users/jefftolentino
  Better yet, check out Info from Lasting Impressions.  It has the whole string of changes. Users/jefftolentino

20100514 07:54:34 nbsp Your http://daviswiki.org/Users/CovertProfessor?actiondiff&version2862&version1861 harsh words on my page dont change your shady behavior.  I can forgive it once, but you were told not to do it, and then you did it again. Users/CovertProfessor

20100514 08:34:53 nbsp Crystal, being loud and offensive over on CPs page isnt going to change the fact that your edits have gone against every norm on the wiki.  I highly recommend taking a wiki chill pill, stepping away from the computer for a few days, and coming back for a fresh start next week without the ridiculous edits.  This is a very friendly and helpful group of people, and when youve ruffled this many feathers, you can be pretty sure that youre doing something wrong. Users/TomGarberson
   Right On, Crystal: 20100514 00:06:07   Your judgmental and self righteous attitude is off putting. What sort of chicken s doesnt even let it be known who they are when they sit in judgement of others? Its a long way to fall from the top of that pedestal youve put yourself on. —CrystalWalker These guys like to hide behind their wiki personas, and you smoked em out, it would appear, hehe. Users/BrianOrr

20100514 20:48:31 nbsp Please do show me which comment of someone elses that I have edited.  Also, if you can explain why you changed peoples signed comments to say something other than what the person intended them to say (since you seem to be suggesting that things are not as they appear  i.e., that you were not shilling for a business, even though it appears so), you should definitely say so.  Perhaps we would understand.  Were an understanding bunch, even after weve been called a chicken s.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100514 21:02:50 nbsp A comment on your own page... Are you so self important that you dont remember??

20100514 00:06:07 Your judgmental and self righteous attitude is off putting. What sort of chicken s doesnt even let it be known who they are when they sit in judgement of others? Its a long way to fall from the top of that pedestal youve put yourself on. —CrystalWalker

TO...

20100514 00:04:55 Your adjective and adjective noun is off putting. What sort of animal bodily function doesnt even let it be known who they are when they sit in a container of others. Its a long way to verb from the top of that object youve put yourself preposition. —CrystalWalker Users/CrystalWalker

20100514 21:07:30 nbsp I did not make that change, http://daviswiki.org/Users/CovertProfessor?actiondiff&version2864&version1863 as you can see here.  What were you saying about assumptions?? Users/CovertProfessor

20100514 21:08:59 nbsp We would understand Were an understanding bunch Is that the imperious we?? Users/CrystalWalker
  The Covert P. and his covert cohorts are never overt in person, I bet. Here they can clump together behind the Royal We and luxuriate in judgment. Good job, Crystal. These guys need the digital rock under which they hide lifted once in a while and sun let in. Users/BrianOrr
     I would humbly suggest that you reexamine your assumptions  maybe show up at the next Wiki BBQ to get to know some of your fellow editors, Brian.  Its a pretty durn open group of folk from all walks of life, and the people who edit the wiki range from kids to grandparents, from students at the local high school to members of the City Council.  Its a very large and quite diverse group here.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  No, we refers to your fellow community members  you know, the people who live in Davis with you and who frequent the businesses in Davis.  And who edit the wiki.  As you can see from the above, I am not the only one who is unhappy with your behavior, but we all stand ready to understand your explanation.  Im not being sarcastic here  if there is more here than meets the eye, it would help other wiki editors to know about it, since editing the wiki is a communal effort.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100514 21:16:39 nbsp My, thats convenient for you... Users/CrystalWalker
  Im sorry  whats convenient for me?  That I didnt do what you falsely accused me of?   Users/CovertProfessor

20100514 21:27:39 nbsp Crystal, what is your goal here?  You seem to be simply lashing out at everybody for very random reasons.  What are you trying to do? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20100514 21:31:39 nbsp No not everybody. Users/CrystalWalker
   Please do not engage in personal attacks on the wiki.  If that is not what you are trying to do, then what is your goal? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20100514 21:42:25 nbsp When I am being personally attacked by a (anonymous) user, I feel compelled to defend myself. Users/CrystalWalker
  Thats just it... Im not seeing where there was an initial provocation.  What do you consider to have been the initial attack upon you?  It looks like you were changing peoples reviews and rewriting what they said, as it pretty clear in http://daviswiki.org/Users/CrystalWalker?actionuserinfo your user history.  Thats not exactly the most ethical thing to do, but its not uncommon, as people think its not as obvious as it actually is.  Things like that tend to be forgiven over time, however, so dont feel like you have to defend yourself.  All changes are recorded, which can be embarrassing if you dont know about it before you start editing, and several people pointed out the edits you made and asked you to stop.  I just dont see where anybody personally attacked you on the wiki.  Perhaps you read something as being more harsh than it was intended? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20100514 22:47:41 nbsp Crystal, I edited your comment on CovertProfessors page.  I did so because it was comical.  I dont know if youre trolling or not, but if youre not, you should really consider taking a deep breath.  Itll be good for you.  Try it with me now: breathe in.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  Waaaaaait for it!  OK, now breathe out.  Better?  Good.

Seriously.  Relax.  Any time someone starts getting pissed off around here, it leads to bad things.  CovertProfessor is one of the best contributors around here these days.  Since I started editing frequently, I havent seen him/her make one single malicious, angry, or meanspirited edit.  Obviously I cant get into your head or his/her head, but it feels to me like youre dramatically overreacting. Users/TomGarberson  P.S. Aardvark.
