This is a distribution service of the Crystal Cream and Butter Company, which is based out of Sacramento. This is one of the few remaining milk companies that will deliver milk to your door. For most details regarding the milk, history of business, etc. please consult the website.


Someone might want to take advantage of this service, maybe this is something that the ASUCD should try once? I dunno will they deliver to the dorms. ~Users/DavidPoole

20070608 16:23:43 nbsp Mr. Rice is the guy who did the Davis delveries. He used to deliver to my family when we lived in S. Davis. When he would deliver I would run down the street so I could hop in and ride with Mr. Rice back to my house. He only let me ride once or twice though. Users/MyaBrn

20091122 12:30:09 nbsp Too bad Crystal milk is gross.  If you want REAL milk, try Straus Family Creamery.  They are a local, organic dairy farm that supplies delicious milk to the coop in glass bottles.  When you return the glass bottle you receive $1.50 back, because they reuse their bottles.  THAT is old fashioned.  I am not impressed that Crystal delivers.  Safeway will deliver your whole grocery order for only $10 dollars! Users/AmandaAbughosh

20110519 17:02:26 nbsp It may be the same truck thats parked in the same driveway as before on Sycamore.  Its been repainted with no signage and has a historical license plate. Users/BruceHansen

20110519 18:27:23 nbsp it is the same truck. Mr. Rice lives there and he used to be the delivery man until he retired. Users/jsbmeb

20140607 13:53:13 nbsp Im sorry, but Amanda Abughosh  Crystal milk is not gross.  Youve obviously never had it.  Dont know why you were here trashing it either.  Crystal milk, butter, and ice cream are now and have always been the richest, smoothest, tastiest dairy products ever.  I have tried dozens of brands out of town and nothing compares.
