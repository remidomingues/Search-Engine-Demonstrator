Cuarto Dining Commons, formerly known as the Oxford Circle Dining Commons, is one of three Dining Commons (DC) at UC Davis.  It is unique for several reasons:
 Location: Cuarto is the only Dining Commons located off the main campus, residing just north of Russell Blvd and west of Sycamore Ln (across from University Mall).
 Size: This DC seats 300 people, the smallest of the three by far.
 Sustainability: Cuarto has a focus on sustainability from several angles. The planners and chefs at this DC put much effort into providing ingredients which are local food local (many coming from Davis itself) and seasonal. There is an additional focus on education, including information about the origins of the food.  Additionally, the building itself is LEED Gold certified.

Anyone with a meal plan may eat there. Typically, however, it primarily serves the Cuarto Residence Halls (Emerson Hall Emerson, Webster Hall Webster, and Thoreau Hall Thoreau), as the DC is roughly in the center of those three halls on Oxford Circle, distant from the main part of campus.

It also contains Seasonality, a new showpiece platform emphasizing fresh and local ingredients which are, of course, seasonal.  The salad bar here is unique, as well, as you have more options for lettuces and toppings as well as the option to have someone make and toss your salad for you.

Postremodel, this DC has a different feel from Tercero and Segundo, and a different menu as well.  The emphasis of this DC is on greater sustainability.  The upstairs dining areas are nice and have lots of natural light, and potted plants at each table instead of cut flowers.  The lights have sensors to dim when there is an abundance of natural light.  The tables appear to be made of recycled materials.  You can also choose to sit at one of the tables outside on the secondfloor balcony.

 History 

Once the Castilian Dining Commons closed, this DC became the only DC in Cuarto. Student Housing proceeded to rename it to the Cuarto Dining Commons from the previous name of Oxford Circle Dining Commons. It was newly renovated and open for the 20102011 school year. To achieve its LEED Gold sustainability certification, the renovation of Cuarto Dining Commons reused more than 41 percent of its original interior elements. Approximately 40 percent of new building materials used in the renovation were manufactured within 500 miles of the site. These stats are reported http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/progress/buildings/map.html here.

The old Oxford Circle Dining Commons had quite decent food. It seemed to make some peoples clothes smell awful, but few in the 20056 school year noticed this effect. Old theories about the smell reflected on the fact that the building was not intended to be a food facility when it was built, so the ventilation was less than adequate. Perhaps some of those issues were resolved.

It had extra dining space upstairs, which was sometimes used for group lectures/discussions. The bathrooms were also located on that floor.





20070118 11:07:36 nbsp This DC also has the most diverse taste in music. I was buying vitiman water and heard amish paradise the other day. Ive also heard, funk, the who, terrible hip hop, indian music and my favorite, ELO Users/EmilyKleber

20070203 13:32:24 nbsp Cant forget the Disney music for dinner or hardcore gangsta rap to go with breakfast. Users/JonathanWiles

20070502 11:30:25 nbsp you know, you could request songs to be put on the ipod playlist for the DC! Users/CalvinCheng

20080726 21:48:18 nbsp I hate this DC. My freshman year there was a girl that looked like a rat, and she acted like a female dog. They thought I was stealing silverware but I wasnt so I got caught. They didnt care that I was innocent and told me since I put myself in that situation I should be punished. The head guy at the time said I would be fine cuz he put a good word in for me, but he didnt and therefore I got in trouble. Food is ok. Workers are mean, except for Kevin, if he still works there.

20090315 04:24:17 nbsp it lacks the initial awe of the larger DCs but it quickly makes up for that in terms of convenience when people figure out that the food is the same as in other DCs and that the menu is cycled

its also much closer to its surrounding residence halls than segundo or tercero, which makes a meal even more convenient since you dont have to make a trip out of it Users/fredchen

20090420 00:05:07 nbsp I really hate eating at the OCDC. The service here is pretty bad, once foods are gone, it would take at least 5 to 10 minutes before they bring out more. However, do I enjoy the centralize food area in contrast to Segundo and Tercero Dining Commons, where you would have to walk across the building to get food. Users/KevinC

20100924 22:13:52 nbsp I got a chance to eat here while working with the movein crew. As a former Emerson resident (200910) who would look wistfully as it would be ultra convenient to have a DC so close to home, I would have to say it was pretty good  the architecture and design, that is.

When I walked in, I was initially struck by how small it was  its tiny compared to Segundo but not so much to Tercero. However, unlike the rest of the DCs, the new OCDC has two levels which really helps it in terms of space; unlike Castillians DC which was so tiny that it was often hard to find seating, this place seemed a lot bigger. In addition to new(er) tables, it also features bar seating along the wall. Whether this is a plus (more seats!) or minus (harder to socialize compared to a normal table?) is really up to the visitor.

So how would I rate this? I would say that its a great improvement over Castillian, but lacks the location of Segundo and Tercero. I cant comment on the food as its more or less the same kind of food as the other DCs. Though I will say the days of running to the Emerson store because I didnt want to bike through the rain or walk to Castillian wont be happening for this years Emerson residents; theyll have to walk outside to get their swipe meals.

20110517 17:24:02 nbsp I bike all the way from Tercero to go to this DC! I dont give a hoot about distance, its worth all those 5 minutes not to be in a loud, cliquey, freshmandominated food court. But thats just me, as I sit alone 90% of the time and could get labeled loner (by those who dont know about my club involvement). Anyway, this DC makes lonerness a lot less noticeable or stigmatizing, and their food is better too. Also, they tell you exactly where its from, and avoid serving processed junk. Users/Chelsea744

20110921 20:11:30 nbsp Food at this DC is really good IMObut then again, I think any food is better than my moms crappy cooking. The food here seems to taste better and fresher than the food at the Tercero and Segundo Dining Commons. They also tell you where they get their food from, so you know its not processed. Also, I love how there are lots of small tables here, rather than the big tables found at the other two DCs Users/JenniferNguyen

20120305 23:24:40 nbsp I am a service worker here and I think its pretty great. I know that all the employees strive to keeping things clean and sanitary. And the chefs work very hard to make sure the food tastes just right and is up to quality. :) All the employees eat here, including me, and I think the food is very delicious with a nice variety.
