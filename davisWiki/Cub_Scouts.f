There are several great Cub Scout Packs in Davis.  Cubs Packs are generally, but not always, organized by geographic sections of Davis.  Cub Scouting is lots of fun for the boys, their parents, and their siblings.  Often siblings, of both genders, are encouraged to participate in some Pack Activities.  Cub Scouting focuses on developing the boys minds and character.

Highlights of the typical year include the Pinewood Derby Race, the Blue and Gold Dinner, overnight experiences, a weeklong twilight Camp Cayuse the last week of June, opportunities for resident camp, and the boys moving up in rank to the next level of their advancement.
