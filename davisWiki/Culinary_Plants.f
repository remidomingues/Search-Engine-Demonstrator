Despite all the cursing that can be heard about the Davis weather climate and clay soil, we are actually blessed with low humidity, a light quality which cannot be seen on the east coast, and a long growing season. These combine to provide us with fertile ground to create a true Gardening garden of eatin! Many of the plants found on our Town Flora page do double duty as both ornamentals and Edible Landscaping edibles. The astute/cheap food hungry visitor will notice that many of the plants used in landscaping are actually culinary herbs, fruit trees, and even vegetables. Though not typically grown in the backyard garden, some commercial crops are included here for the odd fellow who may wish to create a miniature rice paddies rice paddy in the backyard pond.If you are a student, there is a class offered by the section of plant biology (PLB 143) regarding culinary and medicinal herbs.
