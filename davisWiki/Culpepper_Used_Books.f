Culpepper Used Books, previously Get Used Books, primarily sells Bookstores textbooks to students. However, some of the historical, sociological, and biographical books are interesting enough for townies to buy for friends or for ones own pleasure.

You can wear your backpack while perusing the shelves since they trust you not to steal books, and there are no lockers/cubbies anyway due to the stores small size. Book prices can be $5$10 cheaper than the UC Davis Bookstore campus bookstore and comparable, if not lower, than OffCampus Books.  Culpepper offers a low price guarantee on textbooks and buys back used books yearround. The only downside to this place is that their selection is far more limited than other local bookstores specializing in textbooks.

Culpepper now offers an online textbook rental program through their website, so that is another great option to save some money on your textbooks. Standard shipping is free for orders over $100, and you can return books directly to the store in person when they are due, instead of having to pack and ship them (even though return shipping is also free). Please note that the rental program is online only, while the books in the store are for purchase.

Their staff is friendly and often only the store manager or student employees are working.  They also sponsor over 100 UCD sports groups and Student Organizations clubs.

Culpepper accepts all major credit cards, debit cards with a Visa or MC logo, personal checks with stateissued photo ID, and of course cash. Students can return books for a full refund with their receipt through the end of the first week of classes of the quarter in question (the date varies based on the quarter). They dont charge restocking fees and the refund is in the same form of payment used for purchase.

20070104 14:23:22 nbsp 100% friendlier, cheaper and more helpful than the bookstore. 110% more than offcampus bookstore. It also features a more polite and less shady staff when conducting buybacks. The only knock is on the limited selection and quantity of books, but that is due to the fact that most UC Davis students have yet to discover this jewel tucked away in the University Mall. Buybacks are reasonable and are usually 50% of the used price. Culpepper Books also engages in price matching, where they will beat any price of a competitor. I make a trip there at the beginning and end of each and every quarter since I stumbled upon the place two years ago. Users/PeterNg

20070104 14:35:42 nbsp They have a sign that they leave out now, looks like a quality establishment that will only improve as traffic increases Users/StevenDaubert

20070727 20:20:57 nbsp This store is so much more convenient than the on campus bookstore!  There are shorter lines, better deals, and nicer people.  Culpepper over MU anyday! Users/Aggie03

20070815 16:08:47 nbsp I buy one or two books here each quarter just for pleasure. Check out the books in their display case, which is viewable from outside the store. Also, the staff Ive encountered have always been polite and quick. Unfortunately, I noticed today that one of the Ps in their name has fallen off of the wall, so temporarily their name is Culpe per. Theres a Latin joke in there somewhere... Users/robinlaughlin

20080612 17:05:34 nbsp I love this place!  It always seems like you can sell back any book here.  Case in point: I recently tried selling a particular textbook back to the university in the MU but they said they wouldnt buy it back because its not being used for a class next quarter.  I went over here and tried selling the same textbook and they said they would buy it from me.  Plus, the people that work here are very, very nice.  Definitely recommend this place to everyone!

20080714 01:06:45 nbsp Very friendly, fast service. If you have a lot of old nontextbooks and are too lazy to sell them on amazon, bring them here. I got rid of about 20 old novels and got reasonable prices, and the only ones they wouldnt buy back were old editions or out of print. Users/Davisgrad13

20080723 14:23:01 nbsp In my own experience, culpepper is far more legitimate than offcampus books, or the campus bookstore, itself.  Very friendly staff, honest, and the process is quick and painless.  I just sold back three bags full of books and got decent prices for them all (I walked away with 60 bucks more in my pocket than before!).  So dont be lazy! Gather up those books, give others a chance to get good prices for required reading, get sum cash, and treat your friends to a round of drinks!!! ;) Users/Sosa

20080925 14:51:58 nbsp Great bookstore! It takes me under five minutes to get inside, buy my books, and leave. They occasionally hand out free stuff, pens and that kind of thing, with their logo. Cheap prices. Again, their selection isnt all that big, but big enough to find books for most lowerdivision classes. And if they dont have what youre looking for, theyll let you know very quickly, so it wont be a waste of time. Users/StephenHudson

20110114 14:57:31 nbsp Wonderful establishment! Polite and helpful staff. I would choose this place over the Off Campus Bookstore just for their customer service.
Theyre extremely honest in explaining their prices too.
One professor even said he refers students to this bookstore because hes at war with the campus bookstore.
Highly recommended.  Users/SusanChang

20110330 15:01:56 nbsp Dont go in thinking youll get a reasonable price for books youre looking to sell, that is, if they purchase them back. Our club is using Culpepper for a sponsor so I would have expected better service in the half dozen times that Ive been there. Rude manager. Unorganized and outdated books.

Go to the book store at UCD or another wellknown establishment that is able to better cater to your needs. Anybody who refers your here is either sponsored by them, or is pushing their own books which they happen to carry. There is no other reason to use Culpepper.  Users/PavelZastava

20110415 15:07:44 nbsp I am one of the owners and am responding to Pavel Zastavas comment from 3/30. I dont know who this individual is or what group it is that we sponsor, so I unfortunately cannot respond to his complaints personally. While our buyback prices are competitive, we make it very clear to all of the student groups participating in our sponsorship program that we do not determine buyback prices ourselves and they are subject to change based on demand for the book in question and if it is a current edition. We will, however, match 20% of what we pay so long as they student mentions the group they wish to support, and will be happy to answer any questions about buyback and the program as best we can. Students can also direct questions to our email: culpepperusedbooks@yahoo.com. Thanks! Users/TamFig

20110802 12:18:06 nbsp Went there today. They are no longer in business. RIP D Users/kkha91
