The Cultural Offerings of the City of Davis

Instructor: Andy Jones, University Writing Program, College of Letters and Science

Description: Freshmen coming to UC Davis may feel overwhelmed by all the new stimuli, choices and responsibilities, despite the university’s best efforts to orient them. Registration procedures, the myriad of clubs and activities, the expansive campus to be navigated by bicycle – all these new challenges, and many more, must be addressed by students coming to our campus for the first time. Because of these primary orientation topics, freshmen too rarely venture into the city of Davis itself to investigate its art galleries, cafes, farmers market, performance spaces, or other cultural offerings. Orienting students to offcampus life rather than to the university itself, this Freshman Seminar will introduce participants to the cultural offerings of the City of Davis.

Participants will investigate most of the following sites and phenomena:
  Virtual Davis (DavisWiki.Org, City of Davis Website, The Davis Dirt, other nominees)
  Art in Davis Galleries (Natsoulas Gallery, Pence Gallery, The Artery, ArtIsDavis, Third Space)
  Public Art (Public Art, The TransMedia Art Walk, Urban Art)
  Public Gatherings (Davis Farmers Market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, Art About on second Fridays, Thursday Evening fire juggling and such at the E Street Plaza)
  Historic Buildings (DresbachHuntBoyer House Hunt Boyer Mansion, Boy Scout Cabin, Hattie Weber Museum)
  Theater and Film in Davis (Varsity Theater, Davis Musical Theatre Company, Davis Shakespeare Ensemble, Common House Productions, Acme Theatre Company, Barnyard Theatre, etc.)
  Café Culture (Mishka’s Café, The Tea List, Cloud Forest Cafe, others)
  The Photography Photographic Scavenger Hunt (Have your digital camera or smartphones ready!)


Seminar Goals: Participants will better understand and appreciate the cultural life of a small city.
Participants will learn to appreciate, analyze, and evaluate public art.
Participants will better understand the presentation of art in galleries and in the public.
Participants will improve their writing by writing for the instructor, fellow classmates, and blogreaders beyond UC Davis.
Students will learn how to work collaboratively on art and culturerelated projects.
Students will practice inquirybased learning, and use critical thinking and research to complete a collaborative project.
Students will practice creating multimodal compositions.

Format: All students will be expected to complete FOUR assignments:
A) Attend all classes and field trips. On those afternoons when we meet at a location in the city of Davis, you should leave yourself extra time to locate and travel to our rendezvous location.
B) Write 500+ relevant words a week in a blog established on WordPress.com or Tumblr, with images when available. The most impressive blogs will present three or more entries a week.
C) Share 100+ words of comments each week on your classmates’ blogs, making sure to comment at least once on each.
D) Complete (with your collaborative group) the photographic scavenger hunt.
Much of the class will be made up of bikeable field trips to locations in downtown Davis. These and the photographic scavenger hunt will take place during class time.

Grading: Participants in this oneunit class will be assigned a letter grade according to their performance in the following four categories:
Class Participation in class and on field trips (preparedness, enthusiasm, quality of comments) 30%
Your blog for the class 40%
Your comments on your classmates’ blogs 20%
Scavenger Hunt Submissions and commentary 10%
