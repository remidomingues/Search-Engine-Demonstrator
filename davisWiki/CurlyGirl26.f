If I wanted to be accurate, Users/CurlyGirl29.

Ive been trolling around on Davis Wiki for years, but just now decided to create my own page. Bare with me, please. This is still pendinga work in progress, if you will.

To wit:  Im just another http://www.mcgeorge.edu/ Pacific McGeorge graduate studying to be yet another attorney.  Im also an aspiring writer (which, probably also makes me a narcissist).  I attended and graduated from UC Davis and fell in love with the Davis community. Funny, since I wasnt crazy about it when I first started at Davis.  I love it so much that I want to someday purchase a home here in The Peoples Republic of Davis.  As an indentured servant, it is a rather lofty goal, but one can dream, right?  Usually I can be found running in the UCD Arboretum or hanging out at Sophias Thai Bar.

I suffer from chronic procrastination which is quite detrimental to any legal career.  Well, that and I read at a fourth grade level.  And not a fourth grader in the Davis Joint Unified School District, either.  I dont read that well.  Any coping mechanisms/tips are much appreciated.  At any rate, Im further proof that you can take the girl out of Davis, but you cant take the Davis out of the girl.




For now, Im using a pseudonym.  Trust me when I say that I have a valid reason.  Rest assured that I am a real person and not a sockpuppet.  You can leave a comment here or email me directly at NotRatedPG@aol.com (My AIM is also NotRatedPG, feel free to pop up for a chat).

I appreciate all of the restaurant reviews.  Keep em coming.  If restaurants werent available, I would probably starve to death.
