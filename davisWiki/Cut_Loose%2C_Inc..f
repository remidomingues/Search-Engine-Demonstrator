While the retail store closed shortly after her husbands passing, Fran still serves her clients as Cut Loose On the Move, and works out of The Sanctuary at 222 D Street, Suite 4. Her phone number remains the same at (530) 7560422.




Cut Loose, Inc. has a beauty supply store on the bottom floor and a salon on the top floor.  The beauty supply store on the bottom floor carries a wide selection of salon shampoos and conditioners as well as styling products.  They also have one the largest selection of styling tools in Davis.  Compared to Pure Beauty they have a larger selection of bleaching products (i.e. developer and powder lightner).  It is also one of the few, if not the only, place that carries alternative colored hair dye.  They have a fairly wide selection of http://www.manicpanic.com/ Manic Panic semipermanent hair dye.  Most of the other places seem to only carry colored hair gel or washout hair color.

On a personal note, the man that helped me referenced owning the store for over 40 years.  He was helpful but quite condescending; paired with his propensity to tell you more than you really care to know, hes an interesting character.  If hes been there for over 40 years, Im willing to bet that he knows his stuff.  Users/KristenBirdsall

I went in here to have some highlights put in, and it ended up running me about $80.  Too much, considering the fact that I had taken about 10 inches off my hair the day before, so it was really short.  I asked some friends and they agreed that this was pricey for short hair highlights without a cut or anything else.  They didnt even mention the price until tney were finished either...

20060428 17:43:55 nbsp POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TAKE HEED!!! The man who owns the store sold me a crappy, overpriced hot air brush with a 30day return policy. I went to return it to him 2 weeks later (as its quality was poor given what I had paid), only to be told it was against State law to return! There was no warning regarding the policy, and when I asked why he replied Because everybody knows that the item cant be returned. I like to support local business whenever possible, but this situation is part of the reason why people shop at stores like Walmart and Targetbecause they stand behind their merchandise. Think hard before spending your money here.  Users/KristaSchreffler

20070602 15:34:22 nbsp I will never go back to this store. Althought they have a good selection of hair products, the experience was awful. The man will talk your ear off, in a bad way. I once went into the store and could not even grab a product for about an hour. I felt too bad to leave because he is an older man but I had no want to hear a story about hair products from before I was born. Everytime I would try to take something to buy it he would tell me, you will not like that. He would not let me make a decision for myself. For your own sake, dont go into that store. Users/rebeccap

20071007 20:15:17 nbsp I regularly get my hair cut by Fran here, and find the experience many times better than other places Ive gone to in Davis.  Highly recommended... Users/ScottLay

20071008 08:27:18 nbsp If I need to dye my hair a crazy color I will go here and buy the products to do it myself at home for way cheap.  The owner is very nice, he likes to talk about hair products and you should have some patience with him because he is hard of hearing.  Hes been known to give free samples of products so that is a nice plus. Users/CalamityJanie

20071019 21:22:52 nbsp Only go into Cut Loose when you have a lot of time on your hands. The guy who owns the store likes to talk, and for a LONG time, and often about things that have nothing to do with what youve come into the store for. It also seems like hes trying to talk you out of his products...? But its fun to chat. Anyways, this store is awesome and highly recommended. They also have a large variety of wild hair dye colors, if youre interested. Users/vanessa

20080731 07:47:19 nbsp There are so many salons and beauty supplies in Davis that it is hard to find a great array of products at the best prices. I have shopped at most of the stores and I find that Cut Loose always give me the best prices and a variety of the best products and they always have sales on large sizes which helps on a students budget. I dont find a need to go anywhere else and you will find the same thing if you go there.  Users/villagio2009

20081024 01:57:19 nbsp Years ago: I had bought some hair products there.  One day I went in to look at what they had.  I was kneeling down to look at some product (because it was on the bottom shelf).  The older lady there was cutting some young womans hair and actually made her get up while cutting her hair and walked her over to stand by the window where I was.  Paraphrasing from memory, she said because the light is better over here.  I think she thought I might be shoplifting.  I never bought from there again.  Perhaps the woman should consider investing in some cameras or mirrors if shes concerned.  The kind of behavior she engaged in can lead customers to feel as if theyre being judged as criminals.

20090116 10:53:19 nbsp I wanted to give this place a try for my sons 1st haircut.  Had good recommendations from 2 sets of awesome neighbors. However, all the comments below are correct. I was on the phone listening to the very talkative owner for a good 15 minutes ramble about odd topics while trying to inquire about appointments and prices. In the end things just didnt work out so well be passing on Cut Loose, Inc. this time.  Users/HeatherMartin

20091208 17:02:27 nbsp When I am in a bind and cant order my usual Special Effects pink hair color from the net because of shipping time, I stop in here and buy some Manic Panic to hold me over. I have heard the same stories many times as has been others experiences, but hes always been really friendly, if a bit straightforward. I wouldnt fault him for it, personally, but I can see how some people might be uncomfortable.  Users/inu
