Welcome to CynthiaCCCs user page.


20070914 15:10:50 nbsp Hi CynthiaCCC, welcome to the wiki, to Davis, and to UCD!  (Not necessarily in that order).  Thanks for your comment on my page.  Like me, maybe youll be able to navigate Plutos on a calmer day.  And thanks for your comments on Tangles and Mishkas.  Im still trying to find a place to get a good haircut, so maybe Ill check Tangles out.  And I agree that hanging out at caf√©s with a laptop is (or should be) what a college town is all about.
