20060109 11:38:04 nbsp I would also Highly recommend Dr. Belgum.  Infact, I have an appointment today Users/CharlesGeorge

20070729 14:49:34 nbsp I became a patient of Dr Belgums after seeing her for a second opinion while I had Howard Shempp, DDS Dr Shempp as my dentist. I highly recommend her. She is very sensitive to my dentistphobia, and takes into account my financial constraints in her recommendations for care. I especially recommend her to people who put off going to the dentist or just dont go because they hate it so much. Shes great!  Users/JoRo

20080417 11:59:01 nbsp This doctors office lacks the moral capacity of a doctor. In JANUARY, my wife wanted to make an appointment. We recently moved to Davis and this dentist was recommended to us by a colleague. The earliest appointment available was MAY 21. Even for this appointment, she had to call three times. The receptionist promised to call back but usually did not do it. On April 17, my wife called for an emergency appointment. They said that they dont have time and provided her the phone number of another doctor. This doctor told my wife that they can not take patients of other doctors, and that any doctor should have a back up when not available. When my wife called Belgums office again, the staff was extremely unfriendly and did not provide any information about back up service. I am used to the thought that a doctor has the moral responsibility to help patients. This thought seem foreign to Belgums office.  Users/bcschipper


       I find this very surprising please remember that she is impacted and getting an appointment with her will take awhile. It isnt an insult to you personally it is just because she is so amazing. Also I have never had anything but good experiences with their office staff. I hope nobody thinks bcschippers experience is typical because all of the people I talk to have had a great experience with her.Users/KevinRobinson


20080512 18:12:05 nbsp Dr. Belgum is highly recommended.  I have been her patient for ten years.  She is always professional, always has time to sit down and listen, and her staff is exceptionally competent.  The hygienist who cleans my teeth is so gentle, especially with the anesthetic injection I need.  She does a great job and believe it or not I actually look forward to going there every three months.  The negative comment below sounds like an unfortunate misunderstanding.  If a doctor does not have time for an appointment, that is just how it is.  Dr. Belgums office referred them to another dentist.  They certainly upheld their professional and moral responsibility in this instance.  I am a doctor too, and I have to say no sometimes.  There is always another way, emergency or not.  Dr. Belgum does not have responsibility to help a new patient she has never seen.  The referral was made. If that dentist was also unavailable then pick up the phone and call another dentist.

20090126 09:41:23 nbsp I would like to rave about Cynthia but I just dont know how to portray it. I discovered her after a few years of being without insurance and after a few months of determined work she had me back in perfect health. I really cant say enough good things about her.
It took awhile to initially get an appointment because she is in so much demand she has a huge waiting list. But that wait was MORE than worth it!
6 out of 5 stars for sure. Users/KevinRobinson

20090212 18:24:00 nbsp I am a new client of Dr Belgums and LOVE her. She was very proactive in telling me how I can take better care of my teeth and gums. She takes SHIP and is conscious of how much things will cost. Highly recommended!  Users/mpclark

20090814 21:39:33 nbsp Highly recommended. Best dentist ever, IMHO. Only does necessary treatment, explains things extremely well, is very accommodating. Also works with a relative of mine who has special needs. She keeps more limited hours than some dentists. Users/TomHinds

20101213 12:39:29 nbsp I went to Dr. Belgum for the first time today with a concern about my wisdom teeth. What I ended up receiving was an in depth lesson on dental care, gum disease, grinding, and other dental problems I did not know I had, or that even existed! My goodness, Dr. Belgum is very knowledgeable and has a genuine concern for her patients. She sat down with me and reviewed my medical history and gave me advice on problems outside of dentistry! I am so happy to have her as my new dentist. She is marvelous, to say the least! :) Users/MariselGabourel

20101214 01:25:02 nbsp @bcschipper  Your situation sounds complicated; I think that you may have been confused about where and how to look for emergency care, which is really unfortunate. Dr. Belgum does not see people for emergency appointments when they are not already patients. Simply scheduling an initial exam does not make someone a patient of Dr. Belgum. To become a patient, a person first has to undergo an initial exam during which Dr. Belgum goes over the patients health history and thoroughly examines the patients teeth, gums, mouth, and jaw. After this, Dr. Belgum discusses what treatment she recommends, and she and the patient can work out a plan for care. Honestly, Dr. Belgum only wants to work with people who are interested and invested in their health, patients who will come in for regular cleanings and checkups. This is one of the reasons she does not schedule emergency care appointments for people who are not established patients. Some folks only wish to go to the dentist when they need immediate care  Dr. Belgum is interested in preventative care, improving the health of her patients, and working with them to maintain good oral hygiene and health.

If you do not have a dentist in town, there is a list of dentists that take turns being a general oncall doctor. I have in the past referenced this list to try to find care for someone who called in with a similar situation as bcschippers wife. The doctor who was scheduled to be oncall refused to see this person who needed emergency care. Its unfortunate that the coordination of this list and schedule seems to be so disorganized.

If you need to be seen for emergency care and cant get in touch with a dental office that can see you on short notice, you can get dental care at the Davis Community Clinic during these hours: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from 8AM to 5PM, Thursday evening (appointments only) from 6PM to 10PM (phone: 530.757.4667). The clinic serves everyone, including lowincome and uninsured people. Folks can pay on a sliding scale and no one is denied care because of their inability to pay. http://www.communicarehc.org/View_webpage.asp?TitleDavis Users/Janny

20120621 19:45:44 nbsp At first I thought she was good, Ive had a 2 cleanings by her staff before and havent seen a huge amount charged to me because my school insurance covered it. BUT after the 3rd cleaning I received a hefty bill of $98 for cleaning and consultation?? I didnt even realize the difference in her cleanings either and $98 is really excessive for a cleaning! Also, I missed my 4th appointment by accident and forgot to call in to cancel it (I was really stressed out over some things that have been happening lately) so worrying about keeping my dentist appointment wasnt at the top of my list at the time. Then I received a letter in the mail from Dr. Belgums office advising me to go to another dentist, and for what? Missing a dentist appointment for another cleaning?? Thats a little bit excessive! Overall, never coming back and would not recommend her to anyone, she over charges for a simple cleaning and consultation when she knows Im a poor college student. Users/Jujubean
