DM Information Systems provides Law Firms litigation support services of various types, primarily dealing with document management for large cases.  Essentially they will take enormous piles of paper documentation and prepare them for court in various ways, or produce indexed document repositories suitable for web, etc.

DM was locally owned and operated for many years before being acquired in 2006.  I believe they are now owned by an IBM subsidiary.
