Dan Powell began D.S. Powell Construction Company in 1977. He built many small subdivisions, townhouses and apartments in and around the greater Sacramento area. In 1986 he built out the last 15 homes in Green Meadows and moved to Davis the following year with his wife Betsy and son Joel. Heâ€™s built commercial projects and restaurants around town and many custom homes in almost every major subdivision in Davis. For the past eight years he and his son Joel (project manager) have concentrated on remodels and additions with an emphasis on custom kitchens and baths with extreme attention to detail and customer satisfaction.

20091127 15:38:37 nbsp We just completed a major remodel using DS Powell and they did an outstanding job. Remodels are never fun, but Dan and Joel and his crew made it as pleasant as possible, and were truly fun to have around. They were always completely upfront and honest, and delivered a great product at a great price. I give them my highest recommendation.   Users/JonFenske
