The Blue Devils are the Davis High School Football team. They play their home games at Halden Field. Everyone who attends DHS should go to at least one home game. Indeed, there is nothing like the sound of music from the DHS pep band mixed with the screams from the Blue and White section under the Friday Night Lights. But watch out, if you come to actually watch a game, sit up a little higher in the stands or else your view of the field will be blocked by the constant stream of high schoolers walking by looking for their friends.

Coach Dave Whitmire led the varsity team from 1980 to 1999. He is the winningest coach in school history, and headed the last (and only) team to win a Sac Joaquin Section Championships, back in the 8889 season. Previous coaches include Ralph Villanueva (coach before Whitmire), Mark Skrabo (took over after Whitmire), and Jim Johnson (took over after Skrabo). Johnson left after the 0708 season, leaving the team to Dan Gazzanaga, who coached two seasons from 0809.  David Blackwell was selected as the new Head Coach in early 2010.

The team is supported by the Davis Blue Devil Football Backers.
