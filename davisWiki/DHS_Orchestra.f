 Background and History 

The Davis High School Orchestra has been around since the earliest years of the high school in the 1920s.

Currently the DHS Orchestra is three ensembles: the Chamber Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra, and a third Baroque Orchestra was approved for the 20092010 school year.  For more than 70 years the HS orchestra was just one group, often performing as a full symphony (with brass, woodwinds and percussion), or otherwise as a string orchestra.  In 2005 enrollment grew so as to allow for a full Symphony Orchestra and a string Chamber Orchestra.   Membership in the Symphony and Baroque Orchestras is by audition in the spring.  No audition is required to join the Chamber Orchestra.  All groups are directed by Angelo Moreno.  Since Angelo came to his position in 2000, the size of the orchestra program has quadrupled in size, from about 35 students to a current enrollment of about 150.  In June of 2006, the Symphony Orchestra performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

Their repertoire has become more challenging as the strength of the program has developed.  At the start of the 20052006 school year, the Symphony Orchestra performed George Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue, featuring student Morgan Jones on piano as part of a fundraising auction at the Mondavi Center.  The Carnegie Hall program included the entire Symphony #9 (New World Symphony) by Antonin Dvorak.

Another highlight of the 200607 academic year was the performance of Beethovens Symphony #6, the Pastoral Symphony.

The entire DHS music department (band, choir, and orchestra) received national recognition as a Grammy Signature School in 2007 and again in 2011.

In the 20072008 school year, the secondary orchestra program took the lead in a combined music program effort to raise funds to continue the elementary music program (band and strings) for the following year.  The fundraising was necessary due to proposed budget cuts that included eliminating elementary music along with other programs.  This was coordinated through the combined secondary orchestra booster organization, DSOMA (Davis Schools Orchestral Music Association).  November 2008 Presidential Election/Measure W Measure W, which passed in November of 2008, secured funding for elementary music for the next three years.  Measure W was renewed in March 2012 as March 2012 Election/Measure C Measure C.

In the 20082009 school year the symphony orchestra was featured at the annual Jammies Classical Concert, sponsored by the Sacramento News & Review, which showcases the best musical talent in the Sacramento area.  In spring of 2010, the Jammies concert featured the Baroque Ensemble, as well as principal cellist of the symphony, Eunghee Cho.

The Baroque Ensemble performed at the annual meeting of the National School Board Association in San Francisco in April, 2011.

In recent years, many orchestra students have auditioned for and been accepted to Allstate and national honor orchestras.  In 2011 and 2012, the DHS Symphony Orchestra was awarded Best High School Classical Group Performance by http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sectsma_Closed Down Beat Magazine.  At various times, individual orchestra members have been awarded Best Classical Solo Performance.

201213:  In Spring of 2013 the DHS orchestras traveled to Seattle to participate in their Heritage Festival, where they received top awards.  In March 2013, electric rock violinist wiki:wikipedia:Mark Wood (violinist) Mark Wood performed with the Chamber Orchestra, along with junior high and elementary orchestra members.

201314: The Baroque Ensemble performed with wiki:wikipedia:Rachel Barton Pine in March 2014 to help raise funds for a summer 2014 trip to Italy.  The rock cello group, wiki:wikipedia:Break of Reality performed with the Chamber Orchestra in May 2014.

 Bodil Wennberg Concert Series and Concerto Competition Winners 

In Spring of every year, the DHS Symphony Orchestra performs together with other elementary and junior high orchestra groups at the Mondavi Center as part of the Bodil Wennberg Concert to raise funds for the Davis public schools orchestra program.  The concert series is in honor of Bodil Wennberg, a local active musician who helped and encouraged grade school music students for many years before she died of cancer.
