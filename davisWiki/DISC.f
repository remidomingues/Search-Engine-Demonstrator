DISC (formerly Davis Indoor Sports Center) offers a variety of programs, activities, equipment, and amenitites; combining specialized facilities for Roller Hockey inline hockey, soccer, Volleyball volleyball, and fitness. It shares the building with Explorit Science Center, located on the south side.  Sac City Rollers train and have their roller derby home bouts at DISC. DISC was mentioned in a Sacramento News & Review http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid498828 article about the Rollers in the http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Archive?issue498819 20070913 issue.

The Davis Enterprise reported on 2/23/2006 that DISC would close on 3/31/2006 after struggling financially for several years.Footnote(Curda, Beth. DISC to close its doors March 31. The Davis Enterprise. 20060223) However, a group of local families involved with the Davis InLine Hockey Association formed Top Shelf LLC and negotiated to lease the rink from the Harrisons to prevent it from closing. The group also plans on purchasing the rink by the end of 2006. Other parts of the building are being leased to other businesses.Footnote(Rooney, Julie. DISC revels in reopening. The Davis Enterprise. 20060330.) More details can be found at http://savedisc.org, which was created in early March 2006 to raise funds to save DISC.

Since the Harrison family wanted to keep the name Davis Indoor Sports Center, the facility is now properly refered to as simply DISC.

I use to play inline hockey here and I am aware Explorit Science Center was using the pro shop and snack bar area for their exhibits.
