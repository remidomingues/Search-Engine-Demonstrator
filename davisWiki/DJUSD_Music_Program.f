General Music
DJUSD does not offer formal (taught by credentialed music teacher) general music education in the lower grades.  That program was cancelled in the 1970s due to budget cuts.  DHS does offer an Essentials of Music class, which has components of music appreciation.  Some schools offer the http://www.bravomusicappreciation.com/ BRAVO Program, funded by site PTA/PTO groups.  North Davis Elementary and Montgomery Elementary have run a music program called http://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/LinkUp/ Link Up.  This May 29, 2012 Davis Enterprise http://www.davisenterprise.com/features/nextgeneration/areallybeautifulgiftforstudentsprogrammakesmusiciansofnorthdavisthirdgraders/ article (you may encounter a pay wall) describes this program at North Davis Elementary.

DHS offers AP Music Theory.
