The DJUSD offers a http://www.djusd.net/learn/spanishimmersion Spanish Immersion program for students from grades K9. Classes (including everything from math to art) are taught in both English and Spanish, but with an emphasis on Spanish comprehension. Students are also educated on various aspects of Hispanic cultures. Its a wonderfully unique and eyeopening experience.

 Schools where Spanish Immersion is available 
  Cesar Chavez Elementary School  The main campus of the K6 immersion program.
  Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School  Immersion available for grades K3.
  Emerson Junior High  Only select courses are available as immersion. Once in junior high, students can also choose to take Spanish as an elective, but will not learn it as thoroughly since they will only be using it in that one class.

Students who successfully make it through the K6 immersion program are regularly placed in higher level Spanish classes once they reach junior high, like taking Spanish 3 in 7th grade. It was quite fun to be mingling with 9th graders and showing them up with perfect accents and a thorough knowledge of grammar! If they do really well, former immersion students could already be taking the AP Spanish 5 test by 9th grade, earning college credits before they leave junior high.
