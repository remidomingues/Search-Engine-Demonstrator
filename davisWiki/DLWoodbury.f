20100805 08:33:44 nbsp Like Jason said a while back, Welcome to the Wiki!  Its nice to have a truly local CSA subscription service.  Are you one of the founders?  I made a couple of adjustments on the page, adding some links, changing it to the third person perspective, and removing a little bit of promotional language.  If you have a moment, please stop by Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner for some info on the role of a business page.  The key thing is that because of our agreement with the IRS, wiki pages are required to be informational, rather than promotional, in nature. Users/TomGarberson
