How to Find Us
We are down the hall from the Hutchison computer lab.
One easy way to locate us is to take the elevator in Storer to the basement, make a right, go around the corner, and were the first door on the left.

Turnaround Time
Turnaround is usually 2 days for samples submitted in the AM and 3 days for samples that are dropped off in the PM. Naturally, due to fluctuations in business  occasionally the turnaround times are faster or slower according to the customer volumes of the day. Samples submitted in the PM the day before a holiday, expect a 1 day delay of the regular turnaround time.
