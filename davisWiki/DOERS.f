DOERS (Devoted Outdoor ExploreRS, sometimes also Davis Outdoor ExploreRS) is a group affiliated by interest in exploring the outdoors with others.  Bicycles Biking, Hiking and Backpacking hiking, geocaching, kayaking, morning walking walks (and more!)  are all possible.  There are no dues, no elected officers, and no newsletters.  No one is in charge of the group.  You are welcome to just attend activities when you have time and interest. Attendance is not expected unless you have volunteered to lead an activity.

Volunteers post activities that you are willing to share/lead to the Google gGoups email list, devotedoutdoorexplorers@googlegroups.com (join using the Google Group address above  only members can post).

Posting Trips
Useful information that you probably want to include: a good description of event and physical aspects (pace, level of exertion, etc.), location and time, clear directions to the location where the activity will start (e.g., provide a link to a map if you know how), description of any suggested gear (e.g., lunch, water, snowshoes, binoculars), contact info, and cancellation conditions (including time and mechanism of indicating cancellation).  We suggest that all activities typically be considered adult activities unless specified as dog friendly or child friendly (but you can always feel free to ask the leader).  Please try to start activities at the time posted.  If you are a member of another group that has an activity appropriate for people in DOERS and you plan to attend that event, feel free to also list it with DOERS (as permitted by the other group).  Note that each participant in DOERS activities is responsible for his or her own health and safety.

 Email Protocol/Etiquette
Every email sent to the list will automatically include DOERS  at the beginning of the subject line.  Please include an additional word in BOLD to specify the type of activity (e.g., HIKE/BIKE/KAYAK/BIRDWATCHING followed by a brief description of the activity)  this allows folks to easily filter out things they arent interested in.  Note that only members of the list can post to the list, so you should use the email address that youre receiving this message via to post.

Messages to the email list should generally be related to outdoor activities  no politics/sales/proselytizing/donation requests/spam.  Safety issues, road closures, etc. permissible.
