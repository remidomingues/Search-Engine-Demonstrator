DRAGON, which stands for Davis Roleplaying Activities and Gaming Organizational Network, meets Friday nights on the top floor of Wellman Hall on Campus.  Meetings start at 5 PM but most people are usually there by 5:45.  People there play a wide variety of games.  The core of the group plays Roleplaying games as the main event, but there are many other types of games around.  You can expect to find:
  Roleplaying games to join
  Plenty of board games to borrow
  Collectible card games (CCGs)
  An everyotherweek LARP

Unofficial Facebook Group: DRAGON at UCD http://www.facebook.com/home.php?skgroup_195178573846891&ap1
this group is brand new (March 2011) can anyone help get it off the ground.

We now have a club song. Even if you dont play D&D hopefully youll enjoy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v54VJWHL2K3I this

In general, people tend to play collectible card games (CCG) and board games in the early hours and Roleplaying games roleplaying games in the later hours, but there are always exceptions.

They maintain an http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/DRAGON_gamers/ email list at Yahoo groups.  The list is moderated for joining to prevent spambot registration  all you have to do is say something intelligible to get on. This list is frequently updated by the club officers to reflect the current club situation such as notes about found backpacks, game openings and closings, room reassignments and the yearly invasion by XzombiesX Future Farmers of America.

Anyone is welcome to join and show up at any time, and people are generally happy to teach newbies the ropes in new games. In addition there is a neglected Facebook group that is a part of the UC Davis network.

 Games 
Among CCGs, Magic: The Gathering and Legend of the Five Rings are the most commonly played.  Participants also tend to bring games such as Illuminati, Chez Geek, and wiki:WikiPedia:Fluxx Fluxx.  Board games are also common, but tend to be geek games like wiki:WikiPedia:Settlers_of_Catan Settlers of Catan and Twilight Imperium rather than childhood games such as Monopoly. Occasionally, someone brings their console games to play on the projectors of Wellman Hall classrooms.

RPG games are really the core of DRAGON, and most people in the club participate in (at least) one of the games.  The longestrunning was a truly bizarre wiki:WikiPedia:Alternity Alternity game, run by Dimitri Horaites for over 5 years.  Other games include such varied systems and worlds as Champions, GURPS, Hackmaster, Mutants & Masterminds, or plain vanilla D&D.  TylerBarrell is usually playtesting a new game, Dragonfire punk fantasy on A weeks and Cape & Hammer gritty super heroes on B weeks (both based on the Universal Decay alternated20 rules set, books will be provided), on alternating weeks.  Chris Rutkowsky, creator of http://www.bashrpg.com/ Basic Action Games, runs a campaign set in the Marvel Universe (Marvel Knights) on A weeks.  Games run either every week or every other week, excluding holidays and finals.

In addition, there are LARP LARPs (live action roleplaying) games running concurrently in The Pit, called Cirque du Perdue Cirque du Perdue and No Spununkling. They typically move inside during the colder days of Weather winter often to the basement levels. They also make use of the Hart Hall courtyard or Social Sciences and Humanities buildings at various times and when Wellman Hall is closed.

 Current Games 
As most games alternate weeks, games are now given assigned a letter to help us keep things straight. Games listed in italics were reported in the last game census to be open and accepting new players.


Even though we have these games set up, were always looking for more GMs or players.  At least some of these games still have open seats, Im not sure which yet.  Its best to just come and ask.

Upcoming Schedule

Week O is when we have offrotation games  people tend to play board games, oneshots, or must make sure they have enough people to run their games.  Week PD is Psuedodragon (see below). Thus completes the wiki:WikiPedia:ABO ABO system of game organization.

 Club Data 
 History 
The club has been running longer than most student members were alive, and has changed names several times.

It started as the Davis Gaming Club in 1992, then changed to D.R.A.G.O.N. (Davis Recreation And Gaming Organizational Network) in 1993 and settled into a comfortable niche in Wellman Hall on Friday nights in early 1994. This gaming club has continued to this very day despite antagonizing university policies.
Many years ago the officers of DRAGON, Davis Anime Club and the English Country Dancers had some overlap.

PseudoDragon
When the campus is closed for one of many reasons, usually a holiday or finals week. The club will take over many tables at Original Steves. At the normal club times (from 5 until they are asked to leave).

Alternately, if the normal room is not available, but Campus is open, then DRAGON will be held in Olson. Likely room 146.

 Culture 
If you want to meet a bunch of strange geeky guys and chicks that like to play Roleplaying games games, feel free to wander into the main meeting room near the middle of the floor.  users/JosephSenecal Joe (a jolly and portly fellow, recognizable by his impressive beard) gives out free popcorn, and generally shares his pizza guys pizza for a buck a slice with soda included.

Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, there are notinsignificant number of women who come to dragon for the roleplaying and board games.  (Just be prepared to deal with the occasional annoying oldschool guy who forgets that little fact from week to week. Club officers fully encourage telling annoying jerks to shut up (or attacking them with giant hyperspace mallets), especially if theyre doing anything to make people feel unwelcome for anything other than obnoxious behavior.)

DRAGON is different from other clubs, as they first meet up in DRAGON Main Room in the center of the building, but then proceed to run games in other rooms.  Each RPG, CCG, or even CRPG can have its own room, which really helps games move along.  After all, each game is truly a different world.

DRAGON also has a permit to play Humans vs. Zombies.
