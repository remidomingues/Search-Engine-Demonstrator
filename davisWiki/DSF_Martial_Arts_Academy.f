 Styles 
The main core of their teachings comes from Kempo KarateDo, Derived from the Shaolin Temple fighting style of China, Kempo KarateDo utilizes punches, kicks, blocks, joint locks, throws and grappling. It is well rounded style with both Hard and Soft applications. Finally, grappling is a huge portion of training from day one, one of the two mandatory classes a week is nothing but grappling.


 Philosophy 
Everyone is welcome to train here, no experience is needed, but those who have had training are just as welcome. Martial Artists are
encouraged to come visit, train, and share knowledge. The ultimate goal is to achieve a level of knowledge and awareness from this art in order to better yourself in any and all ways.

 Typical Class structure 
Classes start with warm ups consisting of calisthenics, stretching and combos (punches, kicks, blocks, shadow boxing style). Once the students are warmed up the technique of the day is taught, usually a defensive application or drill that promotes muscle memory development. During this time the instructor goes into extensive demo and detail so that the students have a true understanding of how to do what is being taught safely and correctly. Then comes the repetitious portion of the class, students pair up and drill what they have learned until a flow is achieved. Once the drilling portion of class is done, the students test the technique on the instructor, if they perform it correctly the instructor gives them instruction on how to practice at home in order to commit it to muscle memory (just like doing homework). If any student has difficulty with the technique, time is taken to make adjustments to aide the student(s) in further understanding the techniques formula. Finally the class cools down with Yoga yoga and Zazen meditation, this helps
with minimizing stiff muscles and joints the next day and brings everyone to a calm relaxed state before leaving class; a calm mind is a healthy mind.
