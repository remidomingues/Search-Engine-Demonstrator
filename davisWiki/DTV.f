The http://www.fcc.gov/ Federal Communications Commission is overseeing a transition from analog TV transmission to Digital TV transmission.  The transition occurred on June 12, 2009.

If you watch broadcast TV, and your TV set is old, you will need to get a converter box to put between your antenna and the TV set.  Converters can be purchased locally at both Rite Aid locations and RadioShack.  You can also buy them at WalMart and Target.

If you have Comcast cable or satellite service, your TV should work normally without modification.  TVs manufactured after March 2007 are required to have digital tuners, so if your set is new, you wont need to do anything, either.

If you need more information on the switchover, visit http://www.dtv.gov/ .


20081106 21:25:41 nbsp We had trouble getting KVIE (channel 6). Then we noticed that KVIE is DTV channel 53. We tried tuning to 53, and it turned into 61, and it worked great, and after that we got 61, and also 62 and 63. Like magic!  Users/Prof.Spice
