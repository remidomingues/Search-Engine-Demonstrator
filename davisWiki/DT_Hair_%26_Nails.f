Theyre also very friendly and sweet  GO there if you havent had a chance! ) Users/thani218

20081027 17:24:21 nbsp I just went here for the first time. Its in a great location (to go shopping and having lunch right next door) while waiting. I like the fact that I can get a hair cut and other services like waxing, all in one stop. I got a pedicure. The lady was really nice.  Users/ptran

20090103 20:33:12 nbsp The service has been and still is great. I will definitely go here again. Although it says MT Nails, it does offer full hair services; including perm, color, high/low lights, cut & dry, rollersets, and shaves, etc. There is a new hair stylist at this location. A lady that seems to have a lot of experience in hairstyling, considering my hair has always been hard to deal with for many barbers/stylists. The service is friendly and efficient; personal, too, as they always strike up a conversation between patron and employee. I absolutely recommend this spot for nails and hair! Everyone here is genuinely nice and very customer service oriented. Two thumbs up!

20100216 23:42:39 nbsp After getting my eyebrow/ lip wax from here multiple times (including today for lip), I have one tip for you for getting wax jobs done here: ALWAYS REQUEST THE OLDER LADY  the one with glasses who seems to run the store. She is gentle, professional, and does a good job. There is a younger girl who works there who also does waxing who you should NEVER accept a wax from. I almost cried from pain when she did my eyebrows once; she is very rough with both ripping the strips and plucking with tweezers. Shes stingy with the soothing oil and doesnt listen to what you asked for, and more than likely your eyebrows will come out looking unbalanced in length and shape. I went in at 7:06 PM tonight to see if I could get my lips done, or if I should come back. They said no, come in, and asked me to go to the waxing room. The younger girl rushed in already dressed in her coat and, in her hurry to leave, practically jabbed hot wax on my face. Two minutes of excruciating pain later, I sat up and saw bright spots from the light she shoved into my face and couldnt even see the huge spot she had missed. If you want to see your work clearly then alright, shine a light in my eyes. If youre going to do that AND miss pretty much the entire right side, you might as well do it in the dark. I was charged $8 for this terrible job, and because of my incapability to not tip, left the store less $9. I think Im going to start trying other places; I only go here because I like to stop by Quicklys after. Users/EvaL

20110425 22:59:47 nbsp I have been getting my hair done here for about a year. Great place for a basic cut. Last time I brought a picture in and she matched it perfectly, which I have never had anyone do successfully before. Users/econmom

20110825 16:27:10 nbsp Dont let the antiquated interior scare you! Ive been to many nail salons in Davis and DT offers the best service for the price! Be sure to ask for Nelson when getting a manicure. He takes the time to make sure his work is perfect. I went it on his day off on accident and someone else did a really bad job. But ask for Nelson!! Hes great!! and friendly too! Users/KatherineJohnson

20130523 12:23:34 nbsp I got both a manicure and pedicure done here. My pedicure lasted for about a week. However, my manicure lasted only 2 days. I wont be coming back here. Its a shame as the people here were very friendly, professional, and didnt ask any personal questions. Users/anonymous121
