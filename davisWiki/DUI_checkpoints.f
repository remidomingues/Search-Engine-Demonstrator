Occasionally DPD will run DUI checkpoints. These consist of breathalyzers and License checks, and if you are piloting a motor vehicle you are required by law to submit to these checks. Many legal scholars consider these checkpoints to be a big part of the socalled http://www.duiblog.com/2005/05/09/theduiexceptiontotheconstitution/ DUI exception to the Constitution.  Mobile Smog checkpoints Mobile Smogs are voluntary.



Frequent locations of these infrequent checkpoints:

 West bound on 5th street, B/D streetish. They will block a lane and have the motorcycle cops looking for people peeling off before the checkpoint down the side streets West of F Street
 Leaving Downtown going under the Richards Underpass they usually dont have the motorcycles as its already one lane and impossible to avoid once you are headed under the tunnel



I think they get state funding to do these occasionally ~SD
