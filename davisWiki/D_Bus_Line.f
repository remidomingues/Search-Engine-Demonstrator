The Unitrans D Bus Line leaves from the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal. It serves West Davis via Highway 113 to Russell Russell, up Lake Blvd., and down Arlington Blvd. to make a loop.

The D line stops at Arthur Street when leaving Campus campus but does not stop at Arthur when going towards campus. Likewise, the D line stops at the University Extension Center stop leaving campus but does not stop when going towards campus.

Prior to 2007, DMU served one union and DSilo served the other.
As of August 2013, the D Night Service follows the same route as Day Service and does not take La Rue Road to Russell Blvd.

This is the best bus line ever.  DLine Pride!  Users/BrentLaabs

Seriously, I hate to break it to the rest of yall, but theres something a little bit awesome about anyone that rides the DLine, a certain je ne sais pas... Users/KrisFricke

Excellent bus line.  Users/KenBloom

Ive ridden most of the bus lines at some point or another, and I gotta say that my fave is the D line.  Its by far the most beautiful and relaxing ride (West Davis, baby!), its not too long and not too short, serves both the MU and Silo/Shields,

AND theres tons of hot guys.  What more could you ask for?  Users/KayRide
