History
Construction was originally supposed to be completed on September 23, 2005. However, due to construction delays, tenants were not allowed to move in until early December 2005.  While structurally complete, the complex still experienced some cosmetic construction, as of March 2006. Those who had signed September leases had been staying in hotel rooms provided by Jon Berkley Management.  They were staying in Comfort Suites  and the Hallmark Inn.  They were also given a $70 a week grocery allowance as it is rather difficult to keep food in the hotel rooms.
