DaVinci High School, or DVHS, is a new Davis high school, part of the http://newtechfoundation.org/network.html New Technology Foundation Network, which centers around a smallclassroom environment, projectbased, collaborative and selfmotivated learning. Their classes are technologybased, and each student receives a laptop for home and school use, though students may also opt to use their personal laptop instead.  The goal of these schools is to train students in, and in preparation for, a workplace environment.

Originally, Da Vinci had only 8 classrooms. After moving to the back half of Valley Oak in fall of 2009(as the front half is the Childrens center), it now has 18 classrooms.

Parking on campus is limited to faculty (of both DaVinci and the Children Center), and students are forced to park behind Symposium.

DVHS colors are Blue light blue, black, green, and silver; the official DVHS mascot is, by student vote in late fall of 2009, the Dinosaurs.
