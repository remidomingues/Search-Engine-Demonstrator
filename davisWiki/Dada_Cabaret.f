SO WHAT IS THIS THING YOU CALL DADA?

Dada is a cultural movement that began in Zurich, Switzerland towards the end of WWI. The movement concentrated its antiwar politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through antiart cultural works.  The names Emmy Henning, Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, Hannah Hoch, Man Ray, Hans Arp and Richard Hulsenbeck may not ring a bell, but they will soon enough.

The Dada Cabaret is the brainchild of UC Davis MFA Acting Candidate, Hope Mirlis.  It is a fun and educational way to gather both the campus community and the Davis community at large in a celebration of art, nonsense and political thought.  The Dada Cabaret is sponsored in part by the Davis Humanities Institute and the Departments of Studio Art, French, German and Theatre & Dance at UC Davis.  Mirlis received one of the City of Davis’ Civic Arts grants in support of this project.
