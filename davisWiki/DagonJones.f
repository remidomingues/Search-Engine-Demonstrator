Dagon H.C. Jones, DDS lives and practices dentistry in Davis.

Married with two teenage sons.

My full name is Dagon Hurricane Casey Jones, I was named after the ancient god Dagon.  Dagon was a god of grain and possibly fish. My parents were older hippies and my mom thought a fish god was appropriate because my zodiac sign is pisces.   My middle name Casey, is from his fathers nickname Casey Jones and Hurricane was chosen by my dad because it sounded cool.  Many people recognize the name Dagon from the H.P. Lovecraft short story and the Cthulhu mythos.

20100524 23:34:15 nbsp Thanks for the feedback....keeping tomatoes watered in small pots is a challenge. Every time these new tomatogrowing gadgets come along, that is the first thing I assess: is the soil volume big enough for Sacramento Valley summer conditions? Users/DonShor


I will be bringing back some abalone from Fort Bragg, likely more than I can eat.  If anyone wants some, post here and I will do my best to get some to you.  I cant sell it so it will be FREE!

20100530 10:34:15 nbsp I used to chauffeur my moms love interest (at the time) on his abalone diving adventures and in return for driving and lugging his weights to and from the beach Id get an entire abalone to myself. Those were some good times!

We should have another wiki BBQ so you can bring some abs and share the love! Users/JenniferCook

20100530 20:38:39 nbsp I will have about 3 or 4 abalone to spare.  they will all be live (or recently dead) and in the shell.  email me your phone number to dagonjones at gmail.com  I will call you when I get home on monday and you can come pick  them up from my home in east Davis. Users/DagonJones

Ill be at the shop in the morning and at oxford circle for a shop bbq at 4pmish.  If youre able, bring the abalone by.  Sorry I missed the wiki bbq, but it was my sons black belt test and we were not in any shape to bbq.  you can stay and enjoy some short ribs. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20100531 23:27:39 nbsp Thanks for the abalone! I pan fried it in butter and olive oil and seasoned it with lemon, salt, and pepper. Delicious! Im going to bread the rest tomorrow and see how that turns out. Users/WilliamLewis

20100601 22:15:10 nbsp I hate it when people call Davis wiki  Wikipedia or Davis Wikipedia Users/DagonJones

20100602 00:58:24 nbsp Why do you think its such a bad comparison? Obviously we have some different conventions, but we are similar too and Im curious how people perceive the similarities and differences depending on their experiences with one or the other. Users/WilliamLewis says that it would imply we require NPOV for example, but I would expect this to be understood as not a universal convention of wikis. What do you think? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100602 09:32:36 nbsp I agree that the Myspace pages are definitely her, but I was specifically referring to the Facebook links. I dont think thats her or her family, and the only confirming evidence besides the profile pic was a Scott with a different last name. Users/MIK

20100603 11:42:57 nbsp I need to talk to you about my teeth... should I just stop by your office later? Users/JenniferCook

20100603 20:46:59 nbsp Just wanted to drop a line and say thanks for the abalone... it was wonderful!  We cleaned it that night and I seasoned it with just salt, pepper, lemon zest, and minced garlic.  Seared it in olive oil and plated over rice.  Delicious!!! Everyone enjoyed it.  My kids liked it until I explained to them what an abalone was. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20100604 08:42:52 nbsp AlexanderHo just showed me how to make them last night :)  Its just a table with a background color.  The image goes in the left cell of the table, with text in the right.  You can use {{{BR}}} to create a line break in the text so the table stays nice and narrow.  To see an example (and get the color), you can edit one of the Include pages, like TimeSink.  You can use that or one of the others as a template, switching up the image and the text. Users/TomGarberson

20100604 08:45:43 nbsp Oh, also... Im not sure about free drawing tools, but www.irfanview.com Irfanview is a fantastic, simple, free image editor and converter.  Stuff like cropping, resizing, shrinking file size, converting file types, and so on are very easy with it.  It doesnt have any tools for drawing/color, though (that I know of). Users/TomGarberson

20100604 10:54:22 nbsp I use GIMP (which Han recommended up above).  If you do an image in MS Paint, Id be happy to color match it.  If you use GIMP, I have a Davis Wiki Notice Palette of colors to work with. Users/JabberWokky

20100608 22:58:35 nbsp The addition of that information to the other page might be a good idea. There was a LOT of context missing. Users/JasonAller

20100608 23:13:16 nbsp Ever heard of a frat toga party using tiki torches? I certainly dont claim that Davis doesnt have the same problems that everywhere else does. Users/JasonAller

20100608 23:19:53 nbsp Im willing to give a six year old a lot of credit, even memories twenty years later, but Im going to keep my mind open to other interpretations. First graders lack the benefits of experience and if you sit and talk with enough of them you can learn a lot and at the same time appreciate that they have a vastly different set of filters for viewing the world.

20100611 10:07:17 nbsp That is a great review. Users/JabberWokky

20100611 13:31:52 nbsp The breaded abalone turned out ok. The problem is that I cooked them a bit too long and they turned out a bit tougher than they should have. Still delicous.

Ive got the skirt frozen, still. Im looking for a good soup recipie to use the skirt with. Any ideas? Users/WilliamLewis

20100629 10:46:57 nbsp There was a LONG running mystery picture of a curved metal grate material.  People started flailing about, trying to figure it out through wild guesses.  I swore it was a bench (I still think there are benches made from the same material with roughly the same curve).  Turned out to be a bottle recycling bin.  Shortly thereafter, there was a similar metal mesh, and I thought it might be a bench.  So now when one goes to the point where people have kind of stalled out, I toss out bench. Users/JabberWokky

20100717 14:01:50 nbsp rode by your office yesterday on the way to the library, I was pleasantly surprise  Users/StevenDaubert

20100726 23:06:54 nbsp Well, I must say Ive been walking around that park since, um, longer than Id care to admit since it would show my age.  But Id never noticed that particular feature before either. Users/WesHardaker

20100801 22:49:59 nbsp Im always fine with anybody editing my words on the wiki (although please remove the attribution if its a really bit change).  I used the term porn because that was what was being discussed.  And it was a series of sexually charged erotic photos that were marketed as such, which readily fits into the classification.  There is some really nice and tasteful pornography out there, and I think labeling it as such shouldnt diminish the artistic merit, just as there are some quite excellent commercial illustrators out there whose work clearly has artistic merit.  For instance wiki:wikipedia:Alphonse Mucha and wiki:wikipedia:J. C. Leyendecker are clearly advertisements and wonderful art.  The label of pornography shouldnt be negative any more than the advertising work of http://www.google.com/images?qAlphonse%20Mucha Mucha or http://images.google.com/images?qLeyendecker Leyendecker. Users/JabberWokky

20100927 14:06:47 nbsp Thanks for fixing my bold problem! Was it an easy fix? Users/matiasek

20100928 09:43:20 nbsp No formatting for you! Users/TomGarberson

20101013 09:11:05 nbsp Thats a little large for an include.  The idea is pretty good; at one point I considered a dinosaur.  I just thought the parrot was a bit more subtle. Users/JabberWokky

20101013 14:53:37 nbsp Dodo idea was awesome. Users/hankim
   Reverted it back.  I still think its rather large compared to the other Includes. jw
    Why not just make it smaller, then?  cp
      Horrible, petty reasons.  :)  Mostly because I really like the way the parrot turned out, I quite like the Monty Python reference, and Im sorry to see it go.  If nobody else resizes it, Ill retool the dodo later to match the others, but I was quite taken by how well that parrot image fit what I was aiming at (the other one I really like is the Andrew Jackson).  But then, its Dagon and Hans wiki too, which is fine by me.  (When I set up my Davis Wiki, itll have PARROTS!  And FREE COOKIES AND MILK!!!)  ;P  jw
       Well, I like the parrot, too.  Any Monty Python reference is a good reference.  So, Im torn.  For what its worth, I miss the little green seed, too.  But maybe thats just me.  cp

20110130 21:55:32 nbsp Thanks for the heads up, but we used to watch Better Off Ted while waiting for everybody to arrive for a RPG somebody ran last year.  The Jabberwocky presentation was great.  Wasnt that the one with the roof garden as the subplot? I have (by coincidence) the same mugs they use at Veridian, black with red interiors.  I kind of want to get some Veridian labels made to go on the sides.  Fun series.  I worked at a wildly successful startup that was purchased by a large financial organization that was eerily similar to Veridian. Users/JabberWokky

20110509 08:18:00 nbsp Those orc teeth are revolting and awesome, but the werewolf teeth are dead on perfect.

20110509 10:34:37 nbsp For the SCA, Im all about history.  Its part of the fun, because thats the hobby.  That said, I do certainly enjoy fantasy as well, and have a users/srednivashtar Troll costume Ive worn more than once, complete with a big green and gold cloak and a ragged, worn looking foam axe I built myself using a wooden handle from Ace Hardware downtown, foam board and paint from The Paint Chip.

20110608 18:12:05 nbsp My family has several doctors who are friends of the family, many who are a generation older than I and who have retired or are retiring after a lifetime of practice.  A perennial favorite topic during holidays was the pharmacological activity of grapefruits and how it was often a culprit in odd cases, even after years of daily consumption with no problems.  It can even cause spontaneous hallucinations (which are rare, but I suppose doctors tend to hear about them), which got the wry observation that if the occasional side effects could be predicted, it would be a much more popular fruit.   Users/JabberWokky

20110822 09:30:28 nbsp Thank you so much Dagon. Like I said, wished our meeting was under different circumstances, but the best part of the visit for me was your attitude.
