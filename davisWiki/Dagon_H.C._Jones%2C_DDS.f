20071011 09:44:33 nbsp I went to Dr. Jones about a month and a half ago or so, after seeing a different dentist for 15 years. Dr. Jones did a great job (better than my previous dentist), and explained exactly what he was doing the whole time. He was able to fix my broken filling immediately, and I never even felt the numbing shot go into my gums (that has never happened before). I highly recommend this dentist. Users/RG

20071013 15:17:08 nbsp I went to Dr. Jones for a tooth extraction and had one of the best dental experiences I have had yet.  He took his time examining my tooth, which has been decaying for about 2 years now.  I got a root canal and never followed up on the crowning, so the tooth has just been open and decaying.  I really hate going to the dentist for anything so I put it off for too long. I know its kind of gross, but it wasnt that bad until a few days ago an infection kicked in and the tooth just needed to come out.  Dr. Jones wanted to save the tooth if possible, but as I thought, it was too far gone.  The numbing shot, which is usually one of my least favorite parts, was painless and easy.  Similar to RGs experience Dr.  Jones explained what was going on, I had told him that it helps me with the experience to know what is occurring as the procedure is happening.  I had been seeing my previous dentist for most of my life, being a Davis native.  Going to see Dr. Jones was a great change and I recommend him to anyone looking for a new dentist. Users/MattHarris

20071127 14:29:34 nbsp Ive been seeing Dr. Jones for a while now and hes an excellent dentist.  Highly recommended! Users/BrianGingold

20071128 22:54:41 nbsp Dr. Jones came to the clinic I currently intern at as a volunteer dentist.  Hes very gentle with the patients and explains things patiently. He is very friendly and explains what hes doing down to the molecular level.
Very knowledgeable! Users/lyusman


20071217 15:31:47 nbsp I am an extremely nervous patient. Dr. Jones is very thorough and aware of my needs, always acting in a considerate fashion to give me the best dental experience.  I would recommend him to anyone!   Users/SamanthaMartin

20080106 13:25:15 nbsp I just want to add some praise for Dr Jones to Brian Gingolds.  I moved to Davis a couple of years ago and had the standard set of teeth Xrays one gets when starting at a new dentist.  From these Xrays Dr Jones recognized that I had an infection as a result of a root canal that was done poorly many years ago.  My immune system had the infection under control but it was slowly reducing the bone at that point.  In time I would have got an abscess and maybe the bone would have been so bad that I would have had to have the tooth out.  Dr Jones referred me to an oral surgeon to have the infection removed.  He was very complimentary of Dr Jones for having seen something that most dentists would have missed. Users/LNewson

20080227 13:34:09 nbsp Hands down, the best dental experience I have ever had. I just went in this morning for a root canal that was the result of a poorly cleaned cavity by my regular dentist down south. Yesterday, I went in for a consultation after feeling pain and they discovered that my tooth had died! I asked maybe 50 questions regarding cost, insurance, and other methods of fixing the tooth and Dr. Jones listened and explained VERY patiently and told me the various costs and benefits of each of the methods. Although I am almost scared to death with dentists and have never ever wanted to be in the chair, once I got over the first 20 minutes, they made the whole three hours it took to complete the procedure easy. They not only made me feel welcome and less scared of the whole process, but also treated me with the most tender care and respect I have ever received from a dental professional. The anesthetic was head on and I usually hate getting shots (bad experiences with my socal dentist), but he knew what he was doing and the drilling was painless! He took painstaking care in making sure that the root canal was done as well as possible!

I have nothing but words of praise for this doctor, his staff, and his three receptionists! Highly, highly recommend to everyone, Ill be recommending him to my friends! Users/CalvinCheng

20080428 23:02:39 nbsp After several years of neglecting my teeth, Dr. Jones did four crowns and an extraction.  His pleasant manner made the whole experience painless and, dare I say it, pleasant?  Hes enthusiastic, professional, and thorough.  I feel completely comfortable in his care.  Ill definitely recommend him to my friends. Users/JiannaR

20080716 20:05:48 nbsp I am very happy to have Dr. Jones as my new dentist. I have had a sketchy track record w/ dentists over the past 20 yearsme not always having insurance, so I feel very secure and safe trusting my dental needs to him. If you have fear or anxiety about dental visits, hes a great choice because he is gentle, very communicative about what hes doing and seeing in your mouth, and has a very warm and friendly office staff. He also is my hero, recently chosing a conservative filling rather than going to a crown which was recommended by my former dentist. Thank you Dr. Jones. Highly recommended. Users/ahbrapeach

20080906 13:50:55 nbsp While Ive never been a patient of Dr. Jones, Ill point out that hes answered technical questions across the wiki, helping people who arent paying him to do so (and not just on the dental questions entry).  He appears to be passionate about the practice of dentistry and honestly care about peoples dental health. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080926 11:31:27 nbsp Dagon Jones and the rest of the staff in this office are absolutely amazing. I had not been to the dentist in years and was very nervous about going to a new dentist in Davis. They got me into their office within 2 days of my call while other offices in town had a 12 month wait list for new patients. Upon examination, Dr. Jones found I had a small cavity. I was super nervous about getting it filled, and he offered to do it that day, right then! It took him less than 10  minutes to have the cavity filled and he walked me through the process step by step. They are so comforting and gentle and really make an effort to do the best job possible on any aspect of their care, even a simple cleaning. The staff took time to get to know me and even sent me a thank you card later that week wishing me well in my pursuits (with details i never would have expected my dentist to care about, least of all remember!). My experience could not have been better, and I couldnt trust Dagon and his staff more. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!! I highly reccomend their office if you are looking for a new dentist or are unhappy with your current dentist. Thanks Dagon and Staff!! Users/Castle

20081016 13:22:18 nbsp Dr. Jones has an artist touch and a doctors hands.  I have received the best treatment at his office and I cant recomend him enough.  The treatment was virtually painless and he is both quick and thourough. Users/LaurentColvin


20090315 23:23:09 nbsp I usually hate going to the dentist and hadnt been to one in a while but I had a really good experience going to see Dr. Jones. I was very happy with the care given by Dr. Jones and his staff. Everyone was really friendly and Dr.Jones answered all my questions. The Dr. is a really nice and smart guy and makes you feel comfortable. He is actually the best dentist I have been to since my childhood dentist. Im glad I looked him up on the wiki and now have a good dentist to go to here in Davis while I finish up school. Id recommend him to anyone. He even sent a thank you card after my appointments. Very pleased!! SHIP insurance took care of everything. Users/Kehaar

20090402 12:14:10 nbsp I have seen Dr. Jones for routine checkups as well as wisdom teeth extraction and cavities. Although my extraction was very unpleasant, I think that the pain was unavoidable. Dr. Jones takes time to explain any questions you may have and never appears rushed. He also offers free dental care in a homeless clinic. He is a wonderful dentist.   Users/JanethN.

20090826 18:09:24 nbsp Dr. Jones is AMAZING. Go see him now. Seriously. I saw him a week ago and got a hand written card in the mail today.  Users/justsara

20090904 07:28:47 nbsp Dr. Dagon Jones and the staff at this office are all very friendly and professional.  I particularly appreciated that they accepted my samesex partners insurance in addition to my own, without even batting an eye or making a weird face.  I know that queerfriendliness isnt a prerequisite for quality dental care, but it definitely makes me feel a lot more comfortable. Users/travis.obrien

20091209 17:44:34 nbsp I just saw the dentist today after having not been to any sort of dentist in a very long while. Everyone that worked with me introduced themselves and shook my hand, and they were all so friendly and conversational. It was a really nice visit. Dr. Jones was also friendly and seems quite knowledgeable. He explained everything and was open for questions and discussion. Im confident that I found a place I dont have to be afraid of going to!  Users/ChristyMarsden
  Update: After a filing and a cleaning, I feel great about this dentist. It seems odd to describe a filing or cleaning as pleasant, but it was, and Id recommend this dentist to everyone. Users/ChristyMarsden

20100318 14:03:25 nbsp You know how there are people who just do a job... and then there are people who really care about their field and peoples health?  Dr. Jones has not been my dentist, but he offered his long distance support as I saw another dentist several thousand miles away.  That kind of empathy and concern for his field and people in need  rather than a simple narrow concern for his practice  demonstrates a professionalism and enthusiastic compassion that is uplifting.  Returning to Davis is our preferred destination after my wife finishes her postdoc position, and we certainly know which dentist we will be seeing. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100813 16:09:28 nbsp After many (bad for my teeth) years of not going to the dentist due to bad previous experiences, and general dentalphobia, I found Dr. Jones office after numerous referrals from friends.  I am so glad I did!  While nothing about the experience of going to the dentist will ever be particularly pleasant for me, Dr. Jones and his staff have gone out of their way to make me feel comfortable, and make the process as easy and painless as possible.  I would highly recommend Dr. Jones to anyone, including highly fearful patients such as myself! Users/mgoodman

20100825 16:17:19 nbsp Dr. Jones and his staff are absolutely wonderful!  I came to get my wisdom teeth removed, and the whole procedure went smoothly.  Afterwards, his staff told me not to hesitate calling postprocedure, should problems arise.  I felt comfortable and in very good hands throughout my visit.  I totally recommend Dr. Jones.  Dental SHIP is accepted here, too. Users/strawberry

20110124 21:33:34 nbsp A few weeks back I had an old filling fall out while eating. Dr Jones office was able to see me the following afternoon, and the office staff did an excellent job of coordinating a short notice appointment via my wife over the phone since I had early morning classes. The staff even went so far as to get a jump start on the insurance billing info so that it was ready by the time I arrived, a huge stress reliever for me since I had only recently been added to my wifes benefits. Despite some early confusion from the Delta Dental website over whether or not Dr. Jones accepts Delta, I can confirm that he does.

When I first walked into the office I was very impressed by the fact that the receptionist was expecting me, that she used my name, and shook my hand. Ive spent the previous couple of years in the military, and it was very refreshing to see that level of professionalism from the entire staff. Dr. Jones took a look at my tooth and told me that my options were to get the filling replaced, which would only be a temporary though cheaper fix, or a crown. I really appreciated that he took the time to explain my options, and lay out the pros and cons of each both with regard to long term dental health and the shorter term issue of finances.

Today I got my temporary crown put in, and I am still completely amazed. I was shown to the dentists chair within 30 seconds of arriving, and I was still five minutes early! I didnt even have a chance to sit down in the waiting room. The whole procedure from walking in the door to walking out after paying took an hour and ten minutes. Ive had probably over 10 cavities, but this is my first crown and I have to say that with Dr. Jones I had far less pain and discomfort during and after the procedure than any other dental work Ive had done. He was even kind enough to give me a call a few hours later to check up on me and make sure that there were no issues with the temporary crown. Ive had oral surgery twice before, as well as a few other medical procedures, and that is the first time Ive had the doctor personally give me a call to make sure everything was ok. Safe to say, I look forward to going back to Dr. Jones office to get the permanent crown installed with no anxiety or fear of the dentist.  Users/IanLord

20110512 11:52:42 nbsp Nice office, great dentist  even though they accept SHIP/GSHIP/Delta, they are not in the delta dental network and I was charged outofnetwork fees (80% xrays/cleanings, rather than 100% coverage).  It comes out to be an extra 3040 bucks per cavity (60% vs 80% coverage for fillings) fyi.  I should have checked it out first before assuming they were innetwork (did anyone else have a different result with SHIP/GSHIP?).  For the routine cleaning, they offered two different polishing methods: the typical rotating brush/drill thingy, and a powerspray of bakingsoda based solution.  I tried the latter, and it was bit messy (albeit it is nice that they have the option) as the spray gets on your lips and it lightly mists your face/neck.
  Update: Thanks for the explanation DagonJones!  That makes way more sense now.  I would still recommend this dentist office even with the current fees for GSHIP. Users/RDW

20110512 19:11:56 nbsp RDW  I began seeing Dr. Jones last year under GSHIP when they were in the Delta Dental plan. This year, theyre not and Ive faced the same increase in fees.  Users/ChristyMarsden


UC Davis changed the benefits package that it provides for students.   Our office has not changed the contract we have with Delta Dental.  Due to the change in the UC coverage, many students benefits were altered.  The plan now provides slightly reduced coverage (approximately 20% difference) when a member chooses an “out of network” dentist. This change was likely due to budget cuts.  In order for a dentist to be “in network” the dentist must allow the insurance company to dictate (reduce) the fees for services.  Because dental offices often run with a very high overhead this frequently (but not necessarily) results in a reduction in the quality of service for the patient (the dentist must work faster, pay employees less, or use cheaper materials and labs).  We decided not to pursue becoming an “in network” dentist because we did not want to sacrifice the high quality of care and service we provide for our patients.  Users/DagonJones
  Do you know if the benefits package for faculty was changed?   Users/CovertProfessor
  Only Graduate student benefits were changed, not undergrad or faculty. Users/DagonJones
     Thanks!  cp
       UpdateAs of October 2011, according to my front office, staff the undergraduate insurance benefits have changed as well. It is now the same as the graduate insurance, faculty insurance has not changed. Users/DagonJones

20110523 20:19:54 nbsp Dr. Jones makes visiting the dentist an anticipated treat rather than a dreaded experience.  The office is clean and calm and the staff very professional and friendly. Both my hygienist and Dr. Jones take the time to treat you as a person, not just a client, and remember personal details like what I am studying at UCD. After each visit you get a customer service survey in your email and I always give them the highest ratings.  They even send an ebirthday card each year!  Dr. Jones can help even the most nervous dental patient relax and carefully explains your options for care.  Ive never had a problem at any cleaning or from any service and I look forward to going in for my cleanings.  Ill be very sad to have to find a new dentist when I leave Davis.    Users/dandysgirl

20110628 23:46:38 nbsp I highly recommend Dr. Jones, as he has been extremely responsive in treating a painful, cracked tooth (requiring a restorative root canal), performed by Davis endodontist Dr. Doms (whom I highly recommend as well). Dr. Jones has been very knowledgeable and thorough, has patiently addressed my questions and concerns regarding treatment, and has been very accessible. He has been in regular contact with Dr. Doms regarding my treatment and I feel valued as his patient and confident under his care. His background and education are extensive and he has strong professional relationships with a broad range of specialists in our area. His office staff is topnotch  efficient, excellent communication with patients, friendly, and their technology allows for text appointment confirmations and reminders, online registration, etc. If you are looking for a great dental practice that will really take care of you, handsdown, this is the one... Users/LynetteEcklund

20110709 12:46:26 nbsp Although you do pay a higher premium for servies at Dagon Jones (even with GSHIP), I have always thought it was worth the extra cost.  In the past, they have always taken the time to explain the correct way of going about oral health care at home, and fillings were done carefully, etc.  However, after coming here for over a year and a half now, I feel like this extra level of service has declined a bit; i.e. when I went back for a cleaning a few months after having a bonded tooth resurfaced (at a out of pocket cost of $275!), I explained that the resurfacing was coming off and the tooth felt rough (the primary reason I had it resurfaced in the first place).  Well, I felt Dr. Jones was hesistant to redo the work.  In fact, I felt a little pressured into just leaving it alone.  Perhaps it was a busy day for the office, but before coming in that day, I would have thought for sure that he would have guaranteed his work without any hesitation.

I remember this situation, and I am sorry you felt your needs were not heard.  I think I misunderstood you and thought you were concerned the bonding was failing (and needed replacement). I explained that it had just gotten a bit rough but did not need replacement, but of course the roughness itself is bothering you. I am more than happy to take care of it for you. Give our office a call and we will fix it at no charge. Users/DagonJones

20110803 12:42:47 nbsp Dr. Jones is great. Super fast and great job done at the same time. He fixed my 3 broken front teeth (almost the half of each was broken) and helped to have a better smile than I used to have. It really helped me to recover faster from my accident because I was really sad and frustrated having no front teeth due to a bike accident. Also, he acknowledges you things, but not necessarily pressure you to get everything done that is not urgent. Some people dont understand the situation of international students having little money (b/c this is not our home ground) and often having a minimum insurance plan. Also, if you have any discomfort after the treatment (which I did), just give him a call, and he will quickly take a look. I would highly recommend him.  Users/SohMinLee

20110810 16:32:12 nbsp I started seeing Dr. Jones before this page was updated to reflect changes in graduate student dental benefits (my fault since I didnt double check when I called for the first appointment), but I agree that the extra money is worth it. I feel like I can trust Dr. Jones to be honest and not do unnecessary work for extra money like my previous dentist did. Every single person in the office is really nice, and Ive even gotten a couple of handwritten cards. Another positive is they will accept multiple insurance plans. For example, between my Delta Dental through GSHIP and still being on my parents Delta Dental, I apparently didnt have to pay anything out of pocket to get all four wisdom teeth extracted. Be aware that if you want to actually be knocked out for wisdom teeth surgery youll have to get a referral for an oral surgeon, but Dr. Jones took mine out with no complications under local anesthetic and a mild sedative. Not very fun, but more affordable and done by somebody I trust. Unless GSHIP makes their dental coverage even worse, Ill stick with Dr. Jones until I leave the Davis area. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110817 08:16:02 nbsp I loves Dr. Jones! I had my wisdom teeth pulled and it was almost a pleasant experience (almost)!!! Dr. Jones was attentive, caring, sensitive, an provided excellent care overall. He even called that night to make sure everything was OK. Interpersonally, he is a genuinely nice guy. He has excellent clinical training, and is always willing to answer any dental question you may have. Furthermore, his office staff is amazing! I give him my highest recommendation! Users/JanethN.

20110822 09:26:53 nbsp Fast, friendly service all around.  Did not plan on having the tooth pulled today, but they saw it as the best solution and did it quickly and as painlessly as possible. Looking forward to my next visit. Thank you to Dr. Jones and his great staff. Users/WesP

20111005 08:38:38 nbsp Dr. Jones, I see youre pretty active on Daviswiki, so Ill ask this question here:  Why dont you take Delta Dental PPO?  Do you have plans to?  What insurance plans do you take?  Thanks! Users/KelMcc
 If you look a few comments up on the date of 20110512, I give a description of the reason our office is not a PPO provider.  We do accept Delta Dental, but we are a Premier Provider not a PPO Provider.  Unfortunately I am not an expert when it comes to the details of dental insurance.  If you have questions regarding dental insurance, our front office staff would be more than happy to explain, just give our office a call.  Users/DagonJones
  Dr. Jones, thanks for the reply.  I inquired w/ my HR dept (Im not a student) and I have a better understanding of how Delta Dental PPO works.  Essentially, I pay the difference on the contracted amounts and what you charge (in addition to norm DDPPO costs to me).  In the interim, I referred my coworker to your office and he was very happy, so Ill probably be making an appointment. Users/KelMcc

20120127 11:51:55 nbsp Dr. Jones is great for my family. The front desk staff are super sweet, and Leslie and Rachel are gentle and kind hygienists.  Users/ClairLee

20120219 20:30:38 nbsp I finally listened to the many personal recommendations Ive heard of dentists Dagon Jones and Paul Johnson, and Im so glad I did. They are great! Everyone in the office was very nice, professional, and welcoming, and the services Ive had so far have been efficient and highly competent. Plus they go out of their way to explain everything and make sure youre comfortable throughout the visit. Theyre a Premier provider (GSHIP), so there is a copay, but its nominal for xrays and cleanings. Seriously, they gave me the best professional cleaning Ive ever had, and have been exactly what Id want from a dental office. Users/zombiek

20120222 11:46:38 nbsp I went to see Dr. Jones for the first time this morning.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should probably mention that Dagon is a friend of mine.  In fact, I was a little worried initially that it might be awkward seeing a friend as a medical provider.  It wasnt a problem at all, though.

The office is probably the nicest dental office Ive been to.  Everyone I spoke to on the staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and professional.  They make you feel welcome right off the bat.  The technician who took my xrays was very pleasant to chat with and (in my lay opinion) seemed to do a very good job.

Dr. Joness initial examination was the most thorough Ive hadin a good way.  In addition to checking out your teeth, he does a periodontal examination, looking for problems with the gums.  He checks the jaw joint and jaw line, having you move your jaw in various ways, looking for any problems.  He also does a soft tissue examination, looking for any potential causes for concern.  He was extremely good about explaining what he was doing and why.  The periodontal examination was a little uncomfortable (it involves checking the gums with pointy things), but it was no big deal.  He had a number of recommendations for preventing future decay beyond my current daily brushing and flossing.  I found it very helpful and informative.

I cant say Im looking forward to going back for some fillings, but Im confident Ill receive high quality care and the treatment will be as ununpleasant as dental work can be. Users/TomGarberson

20120402 13:50:27 nbsp I saw Dr. Dagon Jones today after my last dentists service was very poor (i.e he wouldnt take the time to talk to me, seemed much more focused on chatting with the hygienist than explaining why I needed a filling). Im overwhelmingly pleased to report that this entire office is incredibly professional and helpful. Dr. Jones spent a lot of time talking about my teeth with me, the hygienist and dental assistant I had were awesome, and overall it was a great experience. It turns out I dont need a preventative filling as the last dentist thought. I cant recommend this office more highly.  Users/VinceBuffalo

20121031 07:52:54 nbsp Friendly staff and thorough care made the one hour appointment feel like five minutes! I also got a card in the mail from Dr. Jones, which I am considering framing and placing on a wall, since anything handwritten is a rarity nowadays. I wish I had asked about the more technical side of things, though. This was the first time I had seen a dentist create a 3D digital model of my teeth and I thought that was really cool.
