The Dairy Basketball Courts opened in Fall of 2009 for those who want to play basketball on campus. The courts, located on the south end of the Dairy IM Field, are operated by Campus Recreation. Presumably, these were created to replace the basketball courts on La Rue Road that were torn down to make way for the new Health and Wellness Center.

The basketball courts on La Rue Road were built on top of a former roller hockey rink. Those courts were created to replace the longtime basketball courts that were located at Segundo. Those original basketball courts were demolished so that the new Segundo Dining Commons could be built on that location.
