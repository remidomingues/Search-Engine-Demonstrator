The Dairy IM Field is the lesser known of the two Intramural Fields on the west side of campus. It is located next to the The Dairy UC Davis Dairy across the street from the Hutchison IM Field. Another patch of grass like the rest, this field as well as Hutchison IM Field are used for many IM Sports throughout the year. Mornings on the weekends will usually have many Ultimate Frisbee games, both informal and tournament. And the place is lit up at night like nobodys business. If you want to experience sunlight after 6PM, the The Dairy UC Davis Dairy IM field or any other IM field is your best bet for needing shades after the Night time sun goes down.
