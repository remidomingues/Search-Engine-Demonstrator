Dairy Road is a small street on the UC Davis campus. It runs by the The Dairy Dairy which is home to the Cows cows that the Tercero residents are most aware of. It connects Hutchison Drive to the southern section of La Rue Rd.. Other items of interest include one of the Water Towers and the Central Heating & Cooling Plant. At the south end it connects to La Rue, but you can turn into Visitor Parking Lot 47 as well.
