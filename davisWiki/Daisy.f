Daisy is a 5 year old Standard Poodle (we think purebred) and we got her from the Yolo County Animal Shelter. We dont know where she came from, but she was found a a stray in West Sacramento. We think she was neglected and ignored, since she has so much love to give, and she has developed a slight case of seperation anxiety, even when we leave the room, or let her outside. She learned her name, and how to shake hands in less than 2 days, and we are still working on sit, and lie down. She gets along with her our Poof, but Baby still hasnt come downstairs. Daisy is a patient of South Davis Veterinary Center.
