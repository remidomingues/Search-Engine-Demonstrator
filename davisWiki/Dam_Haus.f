Dam Haus was the house where Shove (see Omnibus Records) practiced and buried statues in 19941996, briefly became a raver house in 1996 and then a noise venue (DAM  Davis AntiMusic House) in 1997.  Evolved in a more rock direction as the Varicocele Records Dude moved on, and then an awful lot of Portland / Seattle bands. In the late 2000s, it became home and practice space to local band, Mucky the Ducky, as well as a central hub for nonprofit Common Frequency. Well known for having the most over the top craft services trays for the bands, including homemade baked beans, shrimp w/ aioli, and gourmet pizzas shipped from Chicago packed in dry ice.

Over the years, the house also become a mainstay in the KDVS community, hosting countless events, meetings, and fundraisers. This homes longevity as a houseshow venue has been due to the lease being handed down from one KDVS DJ to another since 1989. In March 2011, the residents of the DAM Haus were informed that they will not be offered another lease for the 20112012 lease period, ending the 20+ year run as a music/performing arts cooperative and venue. The official reason for this decision is to make repairs and renovations on the property. The residence has been vacated as of August 31st, 2011.

Capacity of 150 people in the living room and kitchen during the Lightning Bolt show, See the Power of Salad DVD for proof.

Booking is no longer available for the DAM Haus.... but there are a lot of great house shows housevenues here in Davis.

20080519 21:22:57 nbsp Hey Rick & Co.  I cant believe Im just now seeing this.  Legend has it that Tiger Traps first show was at the house.

Also, the place was never truly a raver house, but around Halloween 1995 there was lots of funny stuff floating around town and we had a couple of parties that started out as Shove shows, but ended with bad techno and naked girls on rollerskates.

I cant tell you how happy it makes me to still be able to see shows in this house. Users/DaniKandoKaiser

20080723 00:01:59 nbsp A surprising number of people on the above list have RIP listed after their name.  Does this imply that this abode has a remarkably high mortality rate, or am I reading this wrong? Users/IDoNotExist

20080914 23:37:43 nbsp The RIP does not actually mean that the past resident has died, but just moved on. While I cannot confirm that all of those former residents listed are still living, I have seen some recently enough to say, pretty confidently, that they are alive and well. Not sure who started the RIP or what it means, exactly, but it seems like it has lived on over the years. Users/SeanJohannessen
