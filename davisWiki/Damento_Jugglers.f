Juggling Club

The Damento Jugglers  (DavisSacramento) are an informal group of people interested in juggling, unicycling, poi, contact juggling, and other object manipulation skills.  This group has a good mix of students and nonstudents, is participatory, free, and not a performing troupe. All skill levels are welcome, so come by to learn, watch, or to share your skills with others!  Regulars usually bring spare equipment, but if you have any of your own, you are encouraged to bring it.

Currently, the DaMento Jugglers are meeting on Wednesday nights from 6sunset and Saturday mornings at Central Park at 3rd and B streets.

They also have monthly potlucks at Central Park and McKinley Park
