20110719 19:40:56 nbsp One thing is for sure: Dan is the man with the van and the master plan I cant wait to put some more scratch in his hand!

all kidding aside Dans is my go to cab in town... He showed up a little before he said he would (he guessed 15 minutes) and it turns out he is indeed an Audiophile the sub in the cab thumped nicely on the ride downtown! The cab itself was clean, and Dan was super nice! Users/StevenDaubert

20110721 13:03:55 nbsp Dan runs a quick, clean and well organized cab. He showed up on time, was super polite and got our group downtown in a flash. Definitely my new goto cabbie!!! Users/KayceM

20110803 11:07:47 nbsp Dans cab is awesome.  He was scheduled to pick me up at noon and arrived a few minutes early.  Very reasonable flat rate price to take me from Davis to the Executive airport in Sacramento (cheaper than the other places I called). Hes a cool guy and easy to chat with.  Highly recommended.  My new go to cab services in Davis. Users/aroach12

20110813 15:59:31 nbsp Have seen Dans Cab around the bar scene quite a bit. I have never ridden in Dans Cab but the majority of people I have heard talking about cabs in front of the bar I work at are beginning a lot of buzz about it. Its usually call Dans Cab, if hes not available then lets try (insert cab name here), but it beginning to be Dan first, everyone else second...  That says a lot. Dan is a nice guy when you speak to him, reasonable and, thus far, has not been involved with any of the other cab drama Ive seen on the wiki or in real life.

I will still call my friends company first, but if they arent available it will definitely be Dans Cab that I call right afterwards. Users/WesP

20110828 08:23:49 nbsp I called Dan for a 6am ride to the Sacramento airport last week (at Dauberts recommendation) and had a great experience.  Dan arrived early, knocked on the door, and said to just let him know as soon as luggage was ready to go out to the cab, then waited for us to finish getting ready.  The ride was quick and easy, and Dan was entertaining to talk to.  The fare was quite a bit cheaper than a ride for two on the Airporter would have been.  While I didnt do any price shopping beforehand, Id be a little surprised if other cab companies were much cheaper. Users/TomGarberson

20111031 10:26:39 nbsp great service, great attitude. Ill recommend to my friends Users/dorothy219

20111127 22:56:37 nbsp I got a ride from Dans Cab a few nights ago.  It was a very nice ride, clean cab, nice conversation.  I would highly recommend this cab company.  Users/DagonJones

20120214 02:26:02 nbsp After some of the cab drama, both on and off the wiki, I began calling Dan first, every time, for everything from bar pickups to personal rides. Have to say that it has been a pleasure each and every time. Extremely fare rates, rapid service, and honest estimates on arrival times. Probably the best cab in town at present. Dan is a good guy to run into, even if you arent in need of his cab, and I find it a pleasant experience each time we randomly cross each others paths. Users/WesP

20120221 17:45:24 nbsp I want to say thanks to all the clients who have taken Dans Cab!!!! I really do appreciate it and hope to be able to continue to provide great service to Davis residents Users/dnm12

20120221 22:13:08 nbsp We had friends in town this weekend and used Dans Cab to get downtown so we wouldnt have to pick a DD. Not sure how punctuality would have been if we werent such early birds, but he showed up early for getting us there and back, so we werent left waiting. The minivan was comfortable and clean (this might be partly due to the warning of a $250 fee for puking!). Our need for taxis is very limited, but we will call Dan again if the occasion arises. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120408 21:55:52 nbsp Although I have not yet had the chance to become a patron of Dans Cab, I can definitely offer a few words as to the mans character. This morning I woke up and could not find my wallet. When I headed outside to look in my car I noticed a business card had been slid under my door with a note on it. Apparently I had dropped my wallet in the road as I was getting out of my car last night and didnt notice it. Dan did though:) He picked it up and left the note under my door. After I called him, he offered to drop the wallet off to me asap! I even offered the money inside + a little extra to him as a show of appreciation and he wouldnt take it. Might seem like a minor thing but had he not picked it up and someone else had I could be looking at the major headache of replacing/canceling all the cards inside. Thanks Dan! Definitely a stand up guy and next time I need a cab I know who Im calling! Users/WHutch

20120420 08:38:45 nbsp Dan you need to drive a bit slower.  You almost got in a car accident today coming back from Woodland/the airport!!!  I know you were in a hurry as I could see you weaving in and out but slow down man, your life is worth more than being on time.   Users/YogiJen

20120420 12:33:38 nbsp I apologize yogijen my driving should reflect my service which is safe, reliable, and on time.  Please accept my apologies as I will continue to make an effort to improve and be the best I can be as your taxi driver Users/dnm12

20120520 15:21:25 nbsp Best cab ride Ive had in Davis. I called several different cab companies at 1:30am Saturday morning and was told the wait would be over 30 minutes for a cab. I called Dans Cab and was told the cab would show up in 10 minutesit actually arrived even sooner. The van was spacious, Dan was friendly, and the ride was quick. I need to program this number into my phone because this will be the cab company I call first from now on. Users/AlexHirsch

20120608 03:48:59 nbsp Dan was on time, friendly and allowed me to transport my dog to the Davis vet school. I really needed his help and he was there.  He also was not judgmental nor afraid of my very friendly pitbull terrier like most people are.  Thank you Dan ) Users/mshymes

20120923 20:52:09 nbsp We were extremely pleased with our Dans Cab experience, both to and from the Sacramento airport.  He arrived on time, was polite and friendly, and helped us with our bags.  We were bringing our dogs with us  that was no problem.  The van was clean and in excellent condition.  We will definitely call on him again the next time we need a ride. Users/RobertaMIllstein

20130110 17:33:09 nbsp Weve used Dans Cab a few times now for SFO trips  Dan, Steve and Adam are great guys, friendly and helpful. Theyve even stored our childrens car seats while weve travelled and had them ready on pickup. Highly recommend! Users/LizA

20130424 15:07:46 nbsp Love Dans Cab! My friend even dropped her purse inside his cab one night downtown and he returned everything back to her the next day without an issue. Trust worthy, affordable, and great service. Users/ChardaeJones

20130617 12:25:47 nbsp A+ service!  While I prefer to ride my bike ;) a recent injury has necessitated me to find an alternate route to the station.  I chose Dan mostly based on the comments here and I am happy to report these good comments are genuine!  One of the reasons I love living in Davis is the honest, friendly, helpful people that live here.  Dan is a great example of why we like Davis! Users/JohnWallis
