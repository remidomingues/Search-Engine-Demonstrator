Dan Macht talks funny, Legubitron rocks ChoadBot funny, but makes an excellent Cafe Roma latte with a stone cold face.

I removed the R.I.C.H.A.R.D. pic because Im tired of all the sexual predators confusing me with him. Dan

20061011 08:27:57 nbsp Hey Dan.  You are awesome, and Im apologizing cause I was a moron last time you saw me.  You rock despite my ridiculousness! Users/DanReilly

20081115 16:40:15 nbsp Hey Dan,
Im the new owner of Ali Baba Restaurant. Im remodeling the restaurant and I want to start spoken words nights, comedy nights, theme nights of that sort. Since you already have experience in conducting such events at the used to be Cafe Roma, now 3rd & U Cafe, I was hoping you would be willing to help me out. You can drop by the restaurant anytime or drop me a line at: alismoghaddam@gmail.com. I would really appreciate it.
Thanks man,
Ali Users/alismoghaddam
