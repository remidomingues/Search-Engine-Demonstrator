20041108 19:38:28 nbsp Lasers are awesome! I can never remember Dans name!  Users/ArlenAbraham

20041122 20:41:02 nbsp Dan was so excited about Orkut...  Users/JenndelaVega

20041123 20:50:20 nbsp and then it didnt end up being that cool  Users/DanMasiel

20041204 17:05:52 nbsp stop treating this website like live journal.  you dont need to pollute these pages with your daily thoughts and whims.   Users/MikeyBurke

20041206 19:50:21 nbsp You invented the word Hoopie right? Im going to delete it soon if you cant provide some backing.  :\  Users/JackHaskel

20041206 20:43:54 nbsp I actually did not invent the word. I dont remember who I first heard it from, but I dont think its necessary to go around deleting things because you dont like them or they have no backing. On those very grounds I could delete your comments about thai restaurants, but I choose not to out of respect for your right to edit the wiki. Delete what you feel needs deleting but do not take such steps lightly or think that they will be met with approval.  Users/DanMasiel

20041206 21:01:35 nbsp I think hoopie should stay but the there are no hippies in davis line is probably incorrect.  The page could be respectively reworked, like anything :)  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041206 21:08:05 nbsp Sorry if you took offense. The internet is a powerful thing, one that should be respected. Someone COULD just go ahead and invent  something. It might be something trivial like a Hoopie or something more important. I think that itd be good form to make sure that people dont use the wiki to invent things on their whims. What if we started rewritting history? Thatd be bad. Subjective opinions arent taken as fact so itd be wrong to delete them. We probably need a wiki ethics page or something.  Users/JackHaskel

20041206 21:16:22 nbsp I only accused you because you created the pages. I asked numerous people that are hippies, hoopies or coopies whether they had heard of it. No one had.   Users/JackHaskel

20041209 15:30:14 nbsp The Wiki Ethics page has been created. Feel free to erase all this stuff if you want to.  Users/JackHaskel

20041209 17:13:09 nbsp It can stay  Users/DanMasiel

20041221 17:17:42 nbsp Whoa you changed comments to dialogue, truly you control the arcane magick of wiki.  Anyway I didnt understant the grains of salt reference in the Apartheid conversation and decided I had to know..?  Users/KrisFricke

20041221 20:01:39 nbsp Oh, sorry my little emote indicators didnt show up right. I just meant that robs statement should be taken with a grain of salt (i.e. his informal comment should be taken lightly)  Users/DanMasiel

20050117 22:25:39 nbsp I wanted to ask about getting a sexy chalkscreen thing, as well as WEF status.  IM me if you have AIM. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050213 18:58:02 nbsp The Phaff Collection YEAST! Users/ArlenAbraham

20050423 23:55:06 nbsp Hey Dan, congrats on your admission here. I, too, have been drawn in for another 5 or so years by the Physics department.  Users/JesseSingh

20050801 22:16:37 nbsp Why this has taken me so long to post, I dont know... Dan was the first person I EVER met from the Wiki, that was because he was putting up a little OMGLOLWIKIBBQ WIKI sign as I Wikivangelists wandered aimlessly and lost around Slide Hill Park Slide Hill. Dan was my hero for that moment! And he was nice too! Users/MichelleAccurso

20060225 01:53:48 nbsp hey Dan... how late is late for Wellman... theoretically, of course. Users/TusharRawat
