Im a young guy living in Davis with my girlfriend Nicky who I intend to marry someday. I moved here from Winters where I pretty much grew up, a tiny hick town 15 minutes away. My passion is movies, and writing. I love all kinds of music, videogames, good art, the 80s, scifi stuff, ninjas, robots, zombies, Ikea, and comics. Im not as dorky as I sound, I just have some nerdy interests. Thats about all anyone reading this really needs to know. Other than the fact that Im a really cool and nice guy. Yup.
