Dan Friedman is a 3rd year from Los Angeles.

In addition to being the former president of Alpha Epsilon Pi, Dan is also the current president of the Interfraternity Council, the Order of Omega, and the Jewish Student Union. That is why Judaism we call him the Little King Herod of Davis.

He also works the kitchen at the Coffee House CoHo.

He should be very thankful to the Users/AdamGerber mystery man who made this long overdue wiki page.
