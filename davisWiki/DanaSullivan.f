Feel free to drop a comment to say hi, especially if youre new to town or just looking to meet new people!  : )



20080911 21:28:10 nbsp Howdy, Dana, and welcome to the wiki!  I once had a cat named Cthulhu, and still have the receipt from when I had him fixed.  Its not often that you can get official paperwork showing that you neutered an Elder God.  I hope youre enjoying Davis, its a great little town. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
