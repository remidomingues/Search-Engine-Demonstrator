 Purpose 
The purpose of Dance for Kids (colloquially referred to as D4K) is to provide a semiformal dance for teenagers with special needs in Yolo and Sacramento counties.  Many of these teens do not have the opportunity to attend a prom or other formal event that other students do, and Dance for Kids is an opportunity for them to have that experience.

 The Event 
Dance for Kids is an annual event run entirely by the students of Alpha Phi Omegas Iota Phi Chapter at UC Davis, generally through a committee of students. Most years this project has been funded through various fundraisers that the fraternity raises through grants or fraternity hosted events. Many of the attendees of the event come from the Davis Alternative Recreation Program. Usually the event is announced and a sign up is required by the parent in order for the chapter to assess the size of the event and appropriately allocate money and locate a venue as well as other resources as needed.

All aspects of the event are managed by the brothers of Alpha Phi Omega: promoting the event to the community, registration, food preparation, entertainment, security, venue preparation and cleanup, and music.  The event traditionally features dinner, live entertainment, and dancing.  Some years have included promesque photography, as well.

 History 
Dance for Kids was originally inspired by Alpha Phi Omega member Christopher Takemori. The first annual Dance for Kids was held during Spring 2004. In Fall 2003, Chris had come across an application for the APOs Youth Service Granta grant from the National Fraternity to initiate service projects. He applied for the grant with the idea of Dance for Kids in mind. In Spring 2004, Chris succeeding Service Vice Presidents, Michelle Jaromay and Clayton Luu, were notified that the Iota Phi Chapter had received a Youth Service Grant in the amount of $500 and the first Dance for Kids was organized.
