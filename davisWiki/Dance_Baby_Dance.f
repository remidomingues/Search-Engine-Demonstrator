Dancing Dance like you did BEFORE you had kids... with your kids! Let loose for 50 minutes to music that will make you and your kids want to shake your booties!

Well play with instruments and props and do fun group movements with the kids. This time will be as much for the Parenting parents as for the kids. No steps to learn, just dancing for adults and kids together.
