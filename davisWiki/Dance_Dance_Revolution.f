Dance Dance Revolution is a rhythm game by Konami, makers of Arcade arcade hardware involving ridiculous peripherals since the early 90s.  The gameplay of DDR involves stepping rhythmically, or dancing, on four panels, pointing in the four cardinal directions.  Listen to the music and watch the screen.  When the arrows match up, step on the corresponding arrow on the floor.

Because of the rigidity of some players techniques, many believe the gameplay holds little resemblance to the commmon notion dancing, while some players hold steadfast that DDR is legitimate dancing.  Competive DDR tends to be jerky, while freestyle competitions range from classic dance moves to elaborate skits involving costumes and dialogs  all done on the pad.  The latter forms tend to occur at tourneys, however, and are seldom seen on local machines except by people rehearsing for a competition.

Some find it silly.  Some find it curiously addicting. Some find it incredibly loud, especially if its taking place in the apartments apartment above you.

The best player in Davis, by all accounts, is a guy named Dance Dance Revolution Guy Zack.  Local afficionados claim that his patterns are at nearmaximum efficiency, and his form is excellent.  Other DDR players of fairtomiddling skill include Users/KennethWaters, ct, Mpled and Users/NathanDodd  (These three have been playing Pump it Up a lot more of late, though).

The last one was located in Tapioca Express, a business on E Street downtown that has since closed.  If you want to Learn to Dance dance, you can also try Pump it Up in the MU Games Area, or buy a Playstation and a hard pad cause we all know that soft pads just ! work when you get to > 7 feet or heavy...
