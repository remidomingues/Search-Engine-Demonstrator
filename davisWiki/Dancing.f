Everybody should learn to dance (even The Dancing Pigs pigs)! Most people in Davis need to learn how to dance. Dancing teaches you about pace, rhythm, and how to move your body... dancers are better in bed! There are a handful of places in town where you can get started on the right foot or on the left if youre male. With most dance styles, be aware that some places emphasize performance dance versus social dance remember high school?: social dance is the stuff you do for fun in clubs or at weddings, while performance dance is what people do for competition and money. Either way, just keep in mind that most people have a preference of one style over another, and you should be aware of this when selecting a dance instructor.
