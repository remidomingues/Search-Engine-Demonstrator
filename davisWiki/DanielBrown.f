Stuff Ive written

I wrote a first attempt at a Guide for shortterm residents; the wiki helped me find a lot of the stuff I needed before and after I got here, but it wasnt especially easy to organize.  (The shoppingoriented pages were particuarly confusing.)

Stuff to write about

Ill probably do lots of food and music reviews.  A couple of weeks ago at the Empyrean Ensembles concert at the Mondavi Center Mondavi Cent(er), I wound up sitting next to the new classical music reviewer for the Sacramento Bee.  I sometimes wish I had his job!

And I think Ill write about flora and fauna in town.  Once I get a camera, I expect Ill put something up about the Acacia Collection and the Mediterranean Collection at the Arboretum.

Ive lived here before

I havent, actually.  But I really find the quote ten square miles surrounded by reality found as the tag line on Davis amusing, as its often used to describe wiki:Ithaca, NY, where I earned my PhD.  Google lists Ithaca four times on the top page of links for that phrase, while Davis falls below Boulder, Madison, Washington, Iowa City, and New York City.  grin  (Of course, Madison, Washington, and ! NYC are all much bigger than 10 sq. mi.)

One other similarity, of course, is that both Ithaca and Davis host excellent agriculture and vet schools.  Unfortunately, it seems that UC Davis doesnt have a http://www.dairystore.cornell.edu/DairyStoreBarInfo.htm dairy bar.



20060205 08:38:33 nbsp A Short Term Living Guide would be a great idea! Although the name I gave it makes it sound like youre about to die.  Users/JackHaskel

 Yeah.  I think Guide for shortterm residents might be better; I dont really want to write a page like Hospices, though if there is one locally, I hope someones written that page.  Thanks for your encouragement! Users/DanielBrown
