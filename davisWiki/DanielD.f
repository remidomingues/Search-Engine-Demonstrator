20100523 19:38:21 nbsp Hello, Mr. D! Just a quick note regarding my http://daviswiki.org/Dee%27s_Wonderland?actiondiff&version216&version115 reversion of http://daviswiki.org/Dee%27s_Wonderland?actiondiff&version215&version114 your edit: the email macro is there to protect your address from spambots. If I recall correctly, the macro will display an easytointerpret name at domain format for folks who arent logged in, and the regular name @ domain format for those who are, so there is no need to change it  its there to help you. Happy editing! Users/EBT
