20081215 10:42:27 nbsp Hey, I restored the Psi Chi Omega entry because Im not quite sure what you meant when you said Lack of popularity.  Has the groups local chapter closed down?  If so, that can be noted, but historical groups are generally kept on the wiki to maintain a historical record of Davis. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081216 00:59:15 nbsp Howdy. Sorry if this sounds a bit brusque, but your deletions of the psi chi omega pages are going to keep being reverted unless you give a good reason (read: not lack of interest) for deleting them.  Users/JoePomidor

20090221 09:16:54 nbsp Yeah, Im sticking with my comment. If you have an option between doing UCCS in Sacramento or UCDC in Washington DC, go to DC. There isnt even a comparison between the two. In the interest of fairness though, I will say that I know that the coordinator who ruined part of the experience, Erika Peters, was replaced with the former Davis coordinator for the UCDC program, Joaquin Feliciano. So its probably improved since my time. Users/SMCareBare

20090226 00:07:41 nbsp Yes I did both. During my time at UCCS, I was an intern at a community development nonprofit called California FarmLink, we helped beginning farmers (often recent immigrants or refugees) get financing and technical assistance to start their farms. I also did some lobbying work on the side. The internship itself was wonderful.

In addition to the internship there were two classes, one which assisted us in crafting an independent research project, and another elective course. There were several of these electives to choose from. I chose one offered through UCR on Californias political economy. The independent research project was quite interesting. The elective course was mostly a waste of time and it was graded on a strict curve, so it was actually pretty stressful. Be warned, if you take a course through another UC campus, be prepared for a months long wait time for the courses to transfer and the strong possibility that the transfer will get screwed up anyways (I took one of the courses pass/fail and the UCD registrar put that into my GPA as a C. It took three months of begging to get that fixed). Anyways, I cant emphasize enough that UCDC is the better choice, but you seem pretty set on UCCS, so thats my two cents worth. Users/SMCareBare
