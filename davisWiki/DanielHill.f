Hello,

My name is Daniel Hill. I was an undergraduate student at UC Davis from 2003 to 2007. I currently work for the University of California, both wiki:sf:Front Page San Francisco and Davis campuses.

Most of my interest in DavisWiki is in the food places! Im more of a browser than a contributor, because all the good things have been said. That being said, Ill add my two cents here and there and make factual corrections.

I try to keep the information about Unitrans updated too, when I can.

Have a great day!
