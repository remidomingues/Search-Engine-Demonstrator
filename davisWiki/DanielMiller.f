I work with the North American Students of Cooperation as their Director of Property and Development, helping people maintain the houses and land for their existing coops and get their community organization skills sharpened up to start new coops.

I am living in Davis mainly to work with the Pacifico Student Cooperative Housing Pacifico Coop to revise the policies and environment for future members.

I have been Vegetarians vegetarian for 15 years, and do not drink smoke, or generally have fun.  Except when I have fun.  I like the Wii, http://wonko.smugmug.com taking photos, debating public policy, and watching the netroots transform the political landscape.  I also like laying in the grass and eating goat cheese.
