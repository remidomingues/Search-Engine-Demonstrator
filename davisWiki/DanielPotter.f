20140412 14:24:54 nbsp Hi Daniel,

You are correct.  The message on the bench could offend a lot of people, but the reasons are subtle.
Im not sure who wrote the message so I cant be sure about the cause.
It could be poor wording by a nonnative English speaker, lack of poetic license by a
native English speaker, or it could have been deliberate.  In any case, you may want to have it changed.

The four sources of the problem are:

1) Igor Rimmers name should not be in all capital letters. It would look insensitive
on any memorial, Jewish or not.  The only way it may have been appropriate
is if nothing else were written afterword, just In loving memory of IGOR RIMMER
But, in this case it should read Igor Rimmer.

2) The ampersand symbol &.  They should actually have spelled out the word
and.  It would look insensitive on any memorial, Jewish or not.

2) The word other would look insensitive on any memorial, Jewish or not.  It should read all Jews

3)The exclamation point after Never again! would also look insensitive on any memorial, Jewish
or not, in this time period.  If the message had been placed there shortly after World War II,
it may have been due to the time period.  They should have used Never again. with a period
instead of an exclamation point as in the issue is settled.

Take care. Users/Maryilyn
