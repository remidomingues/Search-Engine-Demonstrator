Hi All,

I grew up in Davis but moved away just before high school. I then lived oversees for awhile, and finally ended up in Washington, DC to go to school and work.  Since my whole family still lives in Davis, and I really love the city, I moved back in December of 2012.

Davis is a pretty hip little town, but one thing I noticed is that it doesnt have a traditional Kung Fu school.  My dream is to open up a school in Davis that teaches internal martial arts systems like taijiquan Tai Chi, Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and others.  While overseas and on the East coast, I studied and taught these forms of kung fu extensively and really want to share them in my home town.  If anyone has suggestions or would just like to chat about Kung Fu, please let me know.

New Tai Chi classes starting at the Davis Senior Center on June 4. Itll be Tues & Thurs at 6pm. This would be good for those that want to attend classes more than once a week as the per class rate is lower than the same classes at the experimental college.  See the http://communityservices.cityofdavis.org/formspublicationsdownloadcenter/recreationclassschedule updated summer schedule, and go http://communityservices.cityofdavis.org/onlineregistration register for classes here.

I am currently offering Tai Chi, Xingyiquan, and Baguazhang classes at the Experimental College.  See the http://ecollege.ucdavis.edu/courses/catalog?term__None&group130&instructor100306&number&name Spring 2013 schedule

Through the Tai Chi Club at UC Davis I am leading practice sessions in Tai Chi, Xingyiquan, and Baguazhang.

I am also a librarian, aka information professional, with a Masters in Library Science and over three years experience working in places like the Library of Congress where I was a government documents librarian.  Having spent some years in Asia, I am also fluent in Mandarin Chinese and have been able to do some library cataloging work for Chinese language materials.  I currently work as a cataloger for the Yolo County Library Central Services branch in Woodland.


Generally, you want to leave your page where it is, and just add a redirect to your own page for searching.  Users normally get notified if their user page changes, and you cant exactly bookmark pages for other people.  Pages with just your name are considered public pages that arent owned by the user in question, either.  You can try to do your user page without the Users/ prefix, like that wierdo Daubert, but its the hard way.   Users/BrentLaabs
