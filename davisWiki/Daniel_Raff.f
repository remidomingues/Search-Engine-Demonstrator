As an undergraduate, Daniel was an active member of ASUCD.  Starting in the Spring of 2004, he served for about a year as Vice Chief Justice of the ASUCD Court. As a justice, Daniel at times butted heads with Users/KrisFricke Chief Justice Fricke due to competing legal philosophies.  Kris, likening the Court to the U.S. Supreme Court, wanted to use the ASUCD Court to affect ASUCD policy.  Daniel rejected this interpretation.  He believed that the Court was only intended to arbitrate disagreements within ASUCD, not create them. To emphasize the difference between ASUCD law and federal law, at one point Daniel theorized that ASUCD bylaws may be applied retroactively because ex post facto acts of the senate are not prohibited by ASUCD Constitution; of course, this would be subject higher forms of authority (e.g. school policy, state law, etc...).  Daniel was also a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity with ASUCD Senate Senator Thomas Lloyd.
