I am a former prostand up jet ski racer, now in love with street bikes. Very new to this game, but logging miles FAST.   Just bought an 03 Honda f4i, then an 03 R6 soon joined the family this weekend.  Would love to ride as often as possible with responsible, safe expert riders who wont push it past their limits.  AnytimeIll make the effort.   Of course, anyone up for or interested in riding jet skis at Lake Berryessa Berryessa; i am always game for that too; stand ups give a similar rush.
