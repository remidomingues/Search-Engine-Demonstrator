 Student Assistant to the Chancellor Bio
A graduating senior with an economics and communication double major, Daniela De La Cruz, originally from Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, started her college journey back in 2007 as an undocumented, AB540 student. Having identified a need for increased advocacy efforts aimed toward raising awareness of underserved student populations on campus, Daniela spearheaded several campaigns to educate the UC Davis community about the needs of undocumented and AB540 students. After serving incoming firstyear and transfer students as an Orientation Leader and Senior Orientation Leader during UC Davis Orientation and as a peer adviser for the First Year Experience and on the Residence Hall Advising Team, Daniela decided to pursue a career in the field of higher education so she can continue to serve and support students in their academic pursuits.
