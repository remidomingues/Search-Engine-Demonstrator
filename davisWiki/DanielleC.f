Danielle is soon to enter the joys of graduatestudenthood. She looks forward to the sleepless night and that fact that once she really starts her research no one will ever ever understand why she is so excited, but will be annoyed but the stream of biochemistry that she cannot quite seem to stem.

The coolest thing about her are her pet snakes!

20110330 13:13:54 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for all your editing. Users/TomGarberson

20110330 13:42:10 nbsp Awww, thank you! Users/DanielleC

20110331 11:50:45 nbsp Hey, you dont need to be so worried.  I always see your edit comments, and I picture you throwing your arms over your head afraid people are going to accuse you of deleting comments.  Its pretty clear youre doing good stuff to help improve the wiki.  Which is awesome.  Thanks! Users/JabberWokky

20110331 11:58:57 nbsp LOL, Thank you! I have loved the wiki since I was a freshie and thought it was time to give some back. I just dont want anyone to think that I am removing their opinions.  Users/DanielleC

20110331 12:01:09 nbsp If youre interested in a somewhat bigger project, some folks have started integrating, rather than just archiving, comments.  This makes sure that information from the comments remains on the page, and it puts it in a much more accessible form.  For example:

http://daviswiki.org/Beach_Hut_Deli?actiondiff&version277&version176

It obviously takes a lot more time and effort, but can really improve pages.  I dont think anyones done more than a couple yet, but it could be a good trend. Users/TomGarberson

20110331 12:41:26 nbsp As I work during the day, I have the Wikis Recent Changes on a scrolling update on a monitor over to my left.  I have to tell you that your slowly changing edit comments are some of the best Ive seen in awhile.  Users/JabberWokky

20110405 14:58:29 nbsp Nice http://daviswiki.org/Instaconnect?actiondiff&version2127&version1126 work on the Instaconnect page! Users/TomGarberson

20110405 15:10:47 nbsp Thank you! I am trying to make it more factually accurate like the Comcast page while still trying to integrate comments like you mentioned. Are there any other pages that need that kind of attention that I could make my next project when I get done with this one?  Users/DanielleC

20110405 16:22:44 nbsp Thanks for all your wikignoming work around here! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20110415 12:59:07 nbsp Hope you dont mind, I arranged the photos on the pages for your snakes.  You can easily adjust the properties like size (that 400 means its scaled down to 400 pixels wide), whether or not it gets a little black border, and how its aligned on the page.  The only thing that gets a little wonky is trying to arrange multiple photos relative to one another and relative to textthats where the {{{}}} comes in on Ruas page.  Its basically a forced line break so the second photo will appear on the right below the first one. Users/TomGarberson

20110415 13:15:59 nbsp wiki:Wikispot Help with Editing is an excellent resource if you run into any trouble. Users/TomGarberson

20110426 18:47:41 nbsp Cant believe I missed that! FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!!! Users/hankim

20110428 11:15:01 nbsp hahaha, thanks! :D We are currently working on building a facebook page for him so he can feel like he has friends too :P Users/Jennyfish

20110801 11:30:42 nbsp Toll free numbers for rental places in Davis are dicey at the best of times: they often only work in California (or the west coast), so people either trying to arrange a rental or abroad on holiday or other travel cant use them anyway. Users/JabberWokky
