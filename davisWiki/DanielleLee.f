Hey!  Youre confused  I think you want to post something on the events board for your event.  You can propose a change to the featured page here: Next Featured Page.  Best, Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080511 12:33:21 nbsp Awesome writeup on Local Food Week!  Thats the kind of addition that really builds the wiki up.  (I also think you also need to get a photo of Tofu and Bon Bon up, but thats just because Im a rodent enthusiast).  Thanks for the work! Users/JabberWokky
