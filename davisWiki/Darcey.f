  Similar changes happen all over the wiki (Sogas immediately comes to mind), but it is not necessarily the owner/manager doing it. In any case, there are enough Wiki Gnome wikizens watching out for itand it is such an easy thing to fi{{{x}}}that the change has little or no effect to wiki content as a whole.  Users/KevinChin
