 Bikes (very out of date) 

I love my bikes, and I love to talk about them.  (Photos coming soon?)  So:

  My primary mode of transportation is an old, scratchedup blue Panasonic road frame (provided by Chris Salam) that Ive partially retrofitted for commuting and touring.  It sports randonneurstyle drop bars and an old set of aero bars that I reconfigured slightly with a length of plastic tubing, all wrapped in yellow bar tape.  The only original component now is the seat  wheels were bought from Kens Bike and Ski Kens, and most of the other parts came from Bike Forth.  I frequently rebuild its various bearing assemblies and adjust the other parts.
  The blue bikes nextofkin is a silver Nishiki road frame  very tall, probably 60  also acquired from Chris Salam.  It is a retrodirect drive bike: If you pedal forwards, you go forwards.  If you pedal backwards, you go forwards in a lower gear.  Ive found the 2speed setup quite effective around town, so long as I dont have to face any steep hills or high winds.  While in Chriss possession the bike was known as Phugit, from the stickers that covered it.  Upon entering my care, however, the stickers were stripped off and its name was changed to Retrovirus.
  The third and last member of my strange twowheeled family is a babyblue recumbent made from three old Schwinn frames that were welded together during a class at the Craft Center many years ago.  The frame reached me by way of another volunteer at the Davis Bike Collective Bike Collective who found it in a dumpster.  I suspect it was originally built with a coaster brake in mind, but I chose to fit it with a Sturmey Archer AW (a classic 3speed internal gear hub) and a caliper brake on the rear.  One of these days Ill come up with a clever front brake, but for now it just stops rather slowly.

The ancillary members of my stable include:

  A whiteandrust colored trailer, originally intended for hauling children, that was long ago redesigned by (I suspect) Domies for cargo carrying.  Ive since stripped off most of the parts and rebuilt it in a few different configurations.  The current hitch design consists of two loops of tube that can be stretched around the seat stay and chain stay (at the rear dropout) and anchored to a hook on the hitch beam.  While in my service it has hauled metal recycling for the Bike Collective, a 4 by 8 whiteboard, CSA CSA boxes, and many other things.
  A set of black fabric panniers made by Nashbar.
  A briefcase converted to act as a pannier and hold a laptop.
  Various bucket panniers: One made from a round bucket with the hook cut from the side of the bucket and two redandyellow square ones provided by Tidy Cats via Davis Waste Removal DWR

In addition, I often tend to the care and feeding of bikes belonging to my friends, though I encourage them to visit Bike Forth and learn about bike maintenance themselves.

All of my bikes are fitted with racks of one sort or another because I dont see much use in a bike that cant carry a full load.  The retrodirect has a folding basket.  (I would use folding baskets more often, but I dont like the rattling sounds they make.)

Many spare parts pass through my hands, since I tend to visit the dumpster behind Kens Bike and Ski fairly often, in addition to the Davis Waste Removal facility on 2nd street.  Most of the parts eventually end up at the Davis Bike Collective, though some of them find their way onto my own bikes.
