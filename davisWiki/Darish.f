20081217 23:00:59 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Doug_Arnold_Real_Estate%2C_Inc.?actiondiff&version28&version17 Your edit, while apparently factual, gives the impression of a conflict of interest. Users/JasonAller

20081218 10:14:50 nbsp I cannot find the information you were using as a source. The website contains no obvious links to such a database. I reverted your edit because there does not seem to be independently verifiable information to back it up. Users/JoePomidor

20081218 15:16:01 nbsp Howdy, I checked the website (http://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp?License_id00832829) and I noticed that the two people in question havent been licensed officers at that business for more than two and a half years. As such, I dont think that the current business should be saddled with such information on their wiki page. Users/JoePomidor

20081218 18:32:52 nbsp Is it a good idea for you as a Realtor to post that on another Realtors page? The information was added to the article part of the page, and not a signed comment with a disclaimer about your involvement in the industry. Being that the events referenced were adjudicated over several years ago, and you offered no further information about the violation really doesnt make it a useful addition to the page.

The Wiki Community Wiki continues to struggle with issues related to the posting of factual information like this, but your posting really left out some critically important information including:
 1. that you are a Realtor. Ethically it is very different for someone to post the results of their attempt to reach resolution with a business professional, and another professional posting on their competitors page.
 2. the nature of the violation. The violation could be a simple procedural issue, or it could be a major ethics violation that is worthy of notice.
 3. a link to the source of your information

Please reconsider. Users/JasonAller

20081219 19:00:28 nbsp Ive also noted that you http://daviswiki.org/Users/Darish?actionuserinfo have been deleting reviews.  In generally, reviews, positive, negative and anything else tend to be accepted on the wiki and not deleted. Users/JabberWokky
