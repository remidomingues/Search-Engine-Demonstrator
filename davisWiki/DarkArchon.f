20100506 00:03:00 nbsp Hello! Heres a late welcome to the Wiki! I answered your question on the Target page. Being under eighteen really is annoying. I was once sick when I first came to Davis for school and I could not even get cough syrup because I had a month left before I turned eighteen. You will have to ask your parents nicely for the game I guess and show them that you are responsible enough to play a game with some persons most likely arbitrary rating system. Good luck!
