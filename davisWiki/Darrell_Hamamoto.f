Dr. Hamamoto is a faculty professor in the Asian American Studies department at UC Davis. He achieved public fame by creating a 50minute pornography pornographic film called Skin on Skin starring AsianAmerican actors and actresses, which attempts to address the desexualization of the Asian American male. Hamamoto created another piece entitled Yellowcaust: A Patriot Act, which juxtaposes clips from Skin on Skin and text describing U.S. atrocities against Asians.

The Daily Show did a segment on Hamamoto and Skin. He is also featured on http://www.amazon.com/MastersofthePillow/dp/B001C1CSRY/refcm_cmu_pg_product_empty Masters of the Pillow, a documentary about the film.

His perspective on race relations in relationships was criticized in a column by Quynh Nguyen titled http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/02/13/Features/DoesRace.Matter.In.Love1316484.shtml Does Race Matter in Love? (along with a taste of his sophisticated racial and gender terminology, such as Yella womenz, White Rice Kings, and slanted for extra Oriental sensation.)

For Winter 2006 quarter, Hamamoto is teaching ASA 140 (Asian American Media) and ASA 150B (Japanese American Experiences).


20060522 13:25:11 nbsp ASA 2 Although I DO think he has a lot to offer as a professor, he IS a prick! I enjoyed the material, thought he is a bit biased, which is not always a bad thing, but he definitely singling out certain students to be an bigger ass to than others. He is a self proclaimed reverse racist, so if you are not asian taking this class, be extra careful not to do anything to piss him off, even more so if you are a guy. That doesnt mean asian girls are in the clear, but not under his sniper scope. Despite everything, i still learned a lot from his class. Users/CarlosBarahona

20081207 23:17:24 nbsp I signed up for ASA2 with him, and dropped it after the first lecture.  I laughed at half of the stuff he said, because it was ridiculous.  The other half of it was pretty damned offensive.  My roommate has told me that he attacks students that are the products of multiethnic relationships, and will literally try to blacklist TAs that dont agree with him from the Asian American Studies department.
