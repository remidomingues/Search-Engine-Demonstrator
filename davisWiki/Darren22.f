20090816 05:37:29 nbsp Hi and welcome to the Wiki, and welcome back to Davis. Your Aggie Liquor comment about their previous location is a helpful addition to the history of the place. Were they one of the liquor stores that had to be outside of the city limits due to liquor laws (unsure of the year that changed)? There were a couple of liquor stores just east of what is now Cindys, on Chiles Road. Users/robinlaughlin
