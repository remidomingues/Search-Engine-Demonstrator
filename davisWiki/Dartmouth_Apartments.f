20120906 16:40:07 nbsp THIS PLACE IS A TOTAL SHIT HOLE! THE PROPERTY OWNER KNOWS IT AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD DIRECTLY BY PPL WHO WORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY THAT THE OWNER SPENDS AS LITTLE POSSIBLE MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURE AND CLEANLINESS OF THE PLACE!! IT IS OVER PRICED, FALLING APART AND A TOTAL DUMP! IF YOU WANT TO LIVE ON A STREET, FIND A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. WANTING TO PARTY IS GREAT! BUT LIVING AT A SHIT HOLE IS NOT!!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT LIVING HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PEOPLE GET ON THE ROOF, BANG ON DOORS AND SMASH BOTTLES HERE (IT IS A HAVEN FOR DRUNKEN DELINQUENCY!! AVOID THIS PLACE!! Users/AlexSobieski

20130820 08:32:55 nbsp Jesus Christ, of all the problems with this complex, the worst is undoubtably the 8:30 am leaf blower walking through the complex. Its been going on for the last 10 minutes. This happens at least once a week, though I dont think the local leaf blowers have coordinated, so youll be deeply frustrated when you wake up 2 or 3 times a week to the same awful noise. Who the fuck pays this guy? Users/BeckPete
