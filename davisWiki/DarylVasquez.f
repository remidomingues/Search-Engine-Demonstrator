Although I am skilled in other forms of media, my primary outlet for my art is in the form of commissioned portraits done in charcoal.  The portraits I have produced includes subjects ranging from beloved pets, family members, and pop culture icons (the Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page). As of now, I have not worked with live models, I prefer to work with photographs furnished to me by my clients.  Please contact me thru my email to inquire about availability and prices.  Currently, I am working on getting a website up and running to showcase some of my pieces from past jobs. Below is one of my flyers exhibiting my faithful reproductions of Joey Ramone and Miles Davis.

I am also very interested in working with other local artists in different forms of media. Please contact me if you are interested.  Thank you.
