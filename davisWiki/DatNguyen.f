20060415 18:13:12 nbsp Just checking, is the logo you made a completely original work? Users/MikeIvanov

20060415 18:17:10 nbsp Yeah, I illustrate chubby animals. Thats my thing in life. Users/DatNguyen

20060415 19:44:19 nbsp I like it.  The logo needs to be an indexed PNG with transparency, though.  You can post your PSD or whatever you are working with and I can do it for you. Users/MikeIvanov

20060415 19:57:31 nbsp Whoops, there you go. I now has the brand new Super Clear Coat Technology (tm). Users/DatNguyen

20060415 20:07:36 nbsp Almost there.  I mentioned that it has to be paletteindexed.  This is for full compatibility with certain IE browsers.  I usually flatten with a black background, scale, convert to indexed (fewer than 256 colors, more IE bugs), add transparency layer, select all fully black areas, and cut them out. Users/MikeIvanov

20060415 20:13:20 nbsp Fixed it for you Users/MikeIvanov

20060415 20:31:52 nbsp Kickass logo! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060416 05:54:29 nbsp In hindsight, I should have converted it to 8bit color. I deliberately didnt because it didnt make sense why itd be a problem. I had it in my head that you guys were using the IE transparency workarounds instead of GIFstyledPNGs. I just figured it was some thing where you wanted to support some arcane browser because you were hardcore. No idea where my mind was at. Ill remember it for the next holiday or whenever.
