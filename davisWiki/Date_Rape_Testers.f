From http://watchyourdrink.com:
  Watch Your Drink coasters were developed to help combat the crime of drugfacilitated sexual assault, more commonly known as Drug Rape. On each coaster there are two separate testing areas. The coasters are simple to use; they are coated with a reactant that changes color to Blue if the KnockOut Drug (GHB, Roofies or Ketamine) is present. The test only takes seconds to perform, and is as easy as placing a couple of drops from the drink in question onto the active test spots by using a swizzle stick or even ones finger.

The mere presence of the Watch Your Drink coaster will create an awareness of this growing problem throughout the world today. This is a special project by GASC, we will be ordering and distributing these coasters soon.

If you work in a bar or live somewhere where Alcohol is plenty, consider distributing these coasters as a safety precaution. To order, visit http://watchyourdrink.com/order.htm

Did GASC ever do this?
