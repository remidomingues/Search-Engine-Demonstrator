With so many people coming and going from this town, there will always be a large population of single people, especially younger college aged individuals. Almost every day, some Media columnist whines about how they arent getting any action. Depending on what your style is, the right person could be anywhere. Only the desperate can be found searching at meat market meat markets or other random Spots And Places spots. Indeed, many find pleasure in solo dining (which can still lead to some pornography action).  Once you find someone, youd better have some good ideas for dates. You should also know about good Makeout Spots makeout spots. Be careful: dating can lead to sex, so you might need some contraception. Dating can also lead to weddings marriage.

One thing that has changed significantly in the last five years is the number of dating resources available to the public. Not only has there been an increase in dating websites ranging from the bland to the extreme there has also been an increase in dating resources and counseling in universities and other privately funded organizations.  If you are a student, note that there are significantly more women at UC Davis than men.  This theoretically means there are fewer excuses for guys, and women might have to share or look elsewhere. In reality these numbers could be skewed based upon possible dichotomies of girls who maintain high school relationships versus guys who do so, and of differences in receptiveness to dating. Furthermore, if the previous statement does not apply to you because you dont believe in monogamy or are not heterosexual, you can still use the following resources or check out the Gay Community page for networking ideas.

Though meeting people over the internet used to be considered taboo, it has slowly become accepted as more and more people become internet savvy, or just dont have time to meet people in day to day life.  As of 2011, approximately one in every five new relationships in the US stems from online dating or social networking sites such as http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook.  On dating sites that require a paid subscription in order to communicate, only a small portion of users tend to be actively communicating at any given time.  On free dating sites a larger portion of users actively communicate, but it can still take considerable time and effort to get a date.  Be cautious since some less reputable dating sites are tied to identity theft or identity monetizing scams (for example: http://themetricsystem.rjmetrics.com/2008/11/06/singlelawnsignsconquertheamericanlandscape/ this report), and deceptive dating profiles can be posted on any dating site.  As an aside, not only can dating websites help you to begin a new relationship, they can just as easily end one, since nearly 30% of all breakups are due to emotional infidelity through dating websites or other online communications.

 Good Dating Etiquette 
  Treat people like you would like to be treated. It is the golden rule, and yet people seem to forget it when dating.
  Be considerate of how others feel and try and empathize with them (that doesn’t mean you have to change how you feel, but show some compassion).
  If you don’t care about someone, don’t take advantage of the situation. Just because you can use someone doesn’t mean you should.
  Be open and honest in your communication. Its truly not for their benefit, although it helps them as well. If you arent honest with your date you may end up involved in a relationship you may regret. Honesty only helps you find someone you are truly compatible with, if not this particular date, then perhaps the next.
