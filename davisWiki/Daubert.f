Is what the Jr Daubert goes by. He has a brother who is 4 years his elder and he had a MUGA (Rabbit) rabbit named after the MU Games Area bowling alley which he used to frequent far too much.
His first name is legally spelled with a PH in the middle but people liked to call him Stephen and its Steven so he has been using it with a V everywhere, except he has yet to get a name change from the courthouse...
He enjoys eating things like Original Steves breadsticks with cheese, the hotdogger wedge fries with jalapeno ranch and season salt, Super Giant Burrito Super Giants, D Taq (with potato),  The Colossus Burger, Silver Dragon hot and sour soup / # J, Sophias Pad Thai Canteen Thai, plutos salad, Mandarin Oranges, and things from the Educated Eatery. His favorite drink is a Shirley Temple, Sophias, bistro, and the Grad make apparently make the meanest Shirly in town, although he has had them in various travels to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica, and also the Nevada side of Tahoe. Thats all the traveling he has done, except for random jaunts to LA, and SC.

3 Degrees of Davis is more likely than you think

Bicycling mostly on greenbelts is his main mode of transportation, it should be yours as well!

oh, hes a Davisites Davisite bornFootNote(He had to be born in Woodland because the Davis hospital didnt have a birthing center yet)  and raised. He grew up next to Users/SabrinaSimonton. He would agree with Users/NickSchmalenberger Schmalenberger on his claim that Davis water rules.

When he was 14 he learned how to play DDR from Robby Ziegler and later he lived with Dance Dance Revolution Guy DDR Guy

Certain business register high on the  Shadiness Factor in his book, he enjoyed patronizing many Departed Business while they lasted. His parents used to get milk from Crystal Dairy Home Delivery However he believes that the driver retired, you can see the milk truck with a different paintjob on Sycamore after the bend just South of Covell.

He used to enjoy listening to loveline, and is fairly stoked about Dr. Drews AM radio show.

He created a page called Best quote about the wiki, its probably not the best quote about the wiki thou... Then again hindsight is always 20/20
He is also engaged in the never ending quest for the coldest drinking fountain

You can find his local political viewpoints hidden on the Albertsons page!


CODE THAT IS AWESOME

Include(UCDCentric) < I was looking for that as well!
Include(Relevance) < looks nicer than ucd centric, but a tad different in message

Did a former ASUCD senator get expelled for cow tipping?

 The above is a snazy way to hide an answer,
or make someone see a warning before highlighting the text to read it.   STD

Those comments stand because nobody else knows more. I cant correct it because for all I know, the proprietor actually says whenever Grandma is up when asked for her hours. If you know more about the store, please dont complain about the wrong information, simply correct it. Its clear that not many people know much (one of the two comments is Wish there was more info), so please add what you know. In the absence of any real information, poorly informed opinion will always fill the void... that has nothing to do with the wiki and is purely a function of human behavior. All you added in your comment was opinion, no expansion or additional information about the actual subject (other than the correction of the name, for which I thank you — Ive renamed the entry). —JabberWokky

The reviews you read here are worth what you paid to see them.
