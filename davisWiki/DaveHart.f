Image(DaveandJoyce.jpg, Dave and Joyce, 400, left, thumbnail)Image(kidz.jpg, Ian, Tamsin and Users/MaxHart Max, 400, right, thumbnail) Dave Hart is http://daviswiki.org/Users/MaxHart Max Harts Da and also http://ianhartart.com/ Ian Harts Da.  He moved here in 1977, disguised as a graduate student to avoid getting a real job.  He decided to camp the family in Davis because of all the valley towns hed lived in this seemed like the easiest one to live in.  He fell into a job with the state Department of Water Resources in the  http://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/current/snow/ Snow Survey Program in 1983 and had so much fun, he plumb forgot all about promotions and becoming successful.  His bidness buddy Joycelyn knows many more people in town because she is basically quite a bit smarter than Dave.  Boy, did he luck out!  A drunkards dream if I ever did see one.  While Daves no genius, he knows a couple things:  (1) that if you work for a salary or wage youd better belong to a good http://www.seiu1000.org/ union and (2) that democracy requires that we stay well http://rtumble.com/ informed..
