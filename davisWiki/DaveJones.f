Hello!  My names Dave, but mostly I go by Jones because long ago God decided that every other person I would meet would have the same first name as me.  He was very considerate to give me an uncommon, memorable last name.

Im a 5th year UCD student doubling in Music Department Music and Psychology, but in all honesty I spend more time with Unitrans (as a driver and supervisor) and rocking out with the California Aggie Marching BandUh Cal Aggie Marching Banduh!  Currently Im serving as the Bands Drum Major.


If youre at all interested in seeing the Aggie Band perform, I encourage you to come out to our Picnic Day show at 9am on Saturday April 19th.  Well be doing a show on The Quad North Quad Avenue to kick off the parade.

Last year I was the Bands Historian.  If youre interested in seeing what a year in Band is like, check out http://youtube.com/view_play_list?pB3F881BD732D27BC this slideshow I made for the incoming freshmen class of 0708:
