Name: Dave Nguyen

About Me: Hi Everyone! I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley, but I currently live in Davis. As such, you can find my pretty much everyday riding on the morning to and evening back Davis Berkeley Shuttle. I usually sit in the back by the table so that I can read without falling asleep. Youll usually find me sleeping :\. I actually JUST moved here and wouldnt mind meeting some of you nice Davis folk, so please feel free to say hello!
