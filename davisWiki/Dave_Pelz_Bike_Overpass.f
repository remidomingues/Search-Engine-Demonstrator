The Dave Pelz Bike Overpass is the Address(overpass, 38.549951, 121.707725) off of Fifth Street that leads from East Davis to South Davis, bridging Interstate 80. It is directly across from the parking lot of the Explorit Science Center Explorit. The Dave Pelz is a great place for watching the sunset, or just hanging out and watching the cars go by.

The bike overpasses bike overpass was named after Dave Pelz, a longtime Davis resident, upon his retirement from the position of Public Works Public Works Director, which he held for 36 years. (note that this Dave Pelz is not the Dave Pelz who writes the golf books)

Recently (circa... 2006?), the Dave Pelz was a site for two political signs, both handdrawn and hung up for the cars to see by bungee cables. One featured the saying, 2K WHY?, the other, The war is a lie.

In September of 2011, the site was used to protests protest the expansion of Mori Seiki in Davis. They displayed a large banner on the northern end of the overpass with the words, Mori Seiki hurts our community. Shame on them!

Two people who could often have been found at the top of the overpass were Users/JohnDudek and Users/AlexNorris, who spent countless hours up top the overpass singing, screaming and talking, though now Users/AlexNorris has moved and the link between their neighborhoods had been changed.

  Someone has been http://search.davisenterprise.com/display.php?id67385 stealing the copper wiring along the greenbelts and bike paths; that may be why the lights are out.  Still good to report it, however.   Users/CovertProfessor

Id also like to mention that this is a great place to sit and watch people come back from Burning Man with their super dirty trucks and crappy bikes. Users/FloridianPlywood
