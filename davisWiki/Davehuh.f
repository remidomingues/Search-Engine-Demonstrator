David Huh started his UC Davis career in 2004 as an Animal Science major and resided in the Emerson dorms in Curato. He was a brief member of Phi Kappa Psi during the year of 20052006. At around this time, David decided to leave school to pursue other recreational interests. When he reenrolled in 2007, he changed his major to Film Studies because he wanted to find a major that held classes at night, so he could finally attend them.

Outside of school, he had a short stint with KDVS and AGTV. Between the years of 2008 and 2009, he joined Filmmakers Ambition and since he has directed and written three short films: The Bike Test, The Bookstore, and 100% Girl.

Film Career at Davis

The Bike Test was entered into the Moon Jump Film Festival (2009) and received moderate praise. The Bookstore remains his biggest accomplishment as a student filmmaker. The short was entered into the Davis Film Festival in 2010 and it was screened. 100% Girl has a small cultfollowing, which incidentally has the smallest cult following possible, with just one fan.

At the end of 2009, David was 12 units shy from graduating, but decided to leave school (for the second time) to experience a film career in Los Angeles. He has worked for several independent film companies including EFish entertainment, and Wallace Pictures. In addition he has worked as a postproduction intern for ABC Family and an editor intern for NBC Universal.

In the fall of 2010, David plans to return to UC Davis and complete his undergraduate degree in hopes of furthering his film education into graduate school.

He owns one cat and has donated $50,000 to AIDS research.
