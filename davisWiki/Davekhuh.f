Film Stint at Davis

The Bike Test 09
The Bookstore 09
100% Girl 09

The Bike Test was entered into the Moon Jump Film Festival (2009) and received moderate praise. The Bookstore remains his biggest accomplishment as a student filmmaker. The short was entered into the Davis Film Festival in 2010 and it was screened. 100% Girl has a small cultfollowing, which incidentally is the smallest cult following possible, with just one fan.
