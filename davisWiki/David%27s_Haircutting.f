I highly recommend David Howard (owner of Davids).  He really knows what he is doing (been cutting hair for like 30 years).  Also, hes a good deal  a hair cut is $35 (as of 5/07).  People with this kind of experience usually cost ~$40  $50 for a hair cut.  Another great thing about Davids is it is a hair salons and barber shops barber shop, as well as full service salon, so everyone feels comfortable. David is also a really nice guy.

20060510 08:52:29 nbsp David does a fantastic cut. Hes a professional who listens to what you want, offers suggestions, and gives you a cut that you are happy with. His basic cuts are still $30 (early 06), and you get what you pay for: $12 at gets you a technician, $30 gets you a professional. His cuts would be $50100 in San Francisco. Users/NickGorton

20060522 22:44:03 nbsp David does a great job.  I came out a much more handsome man and had a great time talking with him too.  He is definitely worth the $30. Users/JasonMoore

20060710 10:19:18 nbsp David is friendly and easy to talk to, he makes going for a haircut enjoyable and he certainly know his stuff. Hes been cutting hair in Davis for roughly 30 years and has the experience to prove it. Try him out, you wont be disappointed. Users/ManiGandham

20060905 16:45:36 nbsp Excellent haircut from a really nice guy.  I highly recommend Users/PedroLaredo

20060921 09:30:41 nbsp Ive been going to Davids for fifteen years!   Hes a wonderful man and an excellent hair stylist.   Users/LouiseCraven

20061009 17:14:26 nbsp Without a doubt, Davids Haircutting is by far the best cut Ive had. David spent extra time on my difficult hair. I think $30 is really low but he seems really caring, especially for students. Highly recommended. Users/DanielHoang

20061223 08:25:47 nbsp David is incredible.  He takes the time to listen to what you want (even when it takes a couple minutes to describe what it is when you dont know the terminology), makes you feel great about your appearance as well as yourself.  Ive never had my hair cut and left feeling great about life before I went to Davids.  He definately has a regular customer now. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20070425 16:30:49 nbsp David has been cutting my hair for a couple of years.  They are usually great, and hes really fun to talk to while hes doing my hair.  Highly recommend him! Users/DavisGradStudent

20070604 22:19:16 nbsp David Howard cut my hair last week and did an awesome job. You get what you pay for and a haircut from David is definitely worth it. Hes also really friendly and easy to talk to while cutting your hair. Give him a try Users/12volts

20070622 nbsp Got my haircut from David yesterday and he did a fantastic job!  He was really fast too, and I was done in like twenty minutes, and I had a lot of hair!  The place in small and quaint and really makes you feel at ease there.  I recommend it to everyone!  Users/atelander

20070712 16:19:10 nbsp I just got back from getting my hair done here and loved it.  Fun to talk to, very energetic, and what I liked most is that he took time to discuss the multiple ways to cut my hair and we decided on what I felt most comfortable with.  I will definitely go back here again.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20070817 18:36:12 nbsp Had my hair cut by David.  Very friendly guy.  Gave me good advice about my hair and tried to honestly change it up while work with the natural behavior of my hair.   For haircuts in the ~35 to ~40 price range, I thought that he was above par for the course (Ive had many places that were worse).   If youd like a more hmm... hip/modern experience, try haircut places around Hamburger Mary in downtown Sac. They use brands like Bumble and Bumble and the scap massinging stuff. +Tailored haircuts for people who live in Davis +Friendly +Great attitute Hes got a bad phone. So if the line is busy, chances are its just off the hook.  Youll have to drop in. Users/atwong

20070820 23:01:15 nbsp I have been going to Davids for the the last six months and he knows how to cut hair. It is really worth the extra cost compared to supercuts. I really want my hair done properly and he delivers. As a guy I can not complain one bit about his shop yet. Users/DonGibson

20071124 22:48:43 nbsp After all the positive reviews from Wiki, I decided to try David. I just went and got my hair cut and colored. I love it! David is a really good listener, and cut my hair really well. The color is fantastic, he sat with me and looked at the colors helping me decide. I highly recommend him! Users/Idunitt

20071212 13:35:04 nbsp Because of the positive feedback here, I called this salon when I was ready to donate my hair.  Some salons will style after the chop for free or for a reduced rate because you are making a charitable donation.  When I called to inquire if his salon participated in the program, he was short Im with a customer so I cant talk and told me if they did this then everyone and their mother would come in looking for free haircuts.  As this is at least a years (or in my case 3 year) commitment to grow your hair to the required 10+ inches, keep it one length and never chemically treat or dye it, I doubt that everyone is jumping at the chance to take advantage of a free haircut after you give it to an organization that helps children with cancer.  Maybe I caught him on an off day but there was no need to be as rude as he was to a polite inquiry in the season of giving.   Users/dandysgirl

20080103 10:52:08 nbsp Went to David (Howard) back in the fall. Definitely liked the haircut. I have tough hair to deal with, and most haircuts end up looking OK but dont stay looking good after a few weeks. However, Davids haircut grew out and even after 6 weeks didnt look bad. If I could tolerate hair in my face, I wouldnt need it cut again. Alas, I need maximum visibility through the hair for little things like flying planes safely.... Going back tomorrow for another haircut!  Users/AndrewLeonard

20080304 15:17:45 nbsp Just got a haircut at Davids.  Definitely knows what hes doing.  Ive never been as satisfied with a haircut before.  Very freindly, very helpful.  Im one of those guys who usually just waves their hands and asks for it shorter.  David talked through different possibilities with me, then did a great job on the one wed picked.  Great hair advice, great haircut.  Will be returning. Users/WilliamWilson

20081118 16:51:50 nbsp I paid $140 for a highlight/lowlight that left my roots red while my highlights were blond.  I have been to upscale salons that do a perfect cut/color/blow dry/straighten for $130... this price did not include a cut and he half blew dry my hair and sent me away with hair that had to be put in a ponytail it looked so bad.  He is a very nice guy, and he cut my hair very well, but he is very overpriced for women.  The environment of the salon is friendly, but unprofessional.  I will be returning home (all the way to san diego) from now on to get my hair done. Users/radioheadlvr

20090313 23:05:18 nbsp Good haircut, okay for the price (around $60 w/ tip).  Users/ladygodiva

20090609 15:39:12 nbsp I got the cutest haircut today, I mean that literally. Im shocked because I went in with a few pictures and wanted the length of this picture but the layers of that picture... I asked for a lot but didnt really know exactly what the final product would look like. The haircut David gave me actually works with the (bizarre) texture of my hair rather than me fighting against it (I have thin, puffy, wavy blonde hair but I want thick, straight, asian hair). For $45 I am very very pleased. I would be pleased with this haircut at any price. Users/Stefphanni

20090925 23:37:13 nbsp I love this place. David knows how to cut mens hair (unlike 99% of other people). I try to save money where I can, but a bad haircut isnt worth it. David is a sure thing, I walk out of there looking good every time. Users/Devonian

20100520 13:58:22 nbsp I started going to Davids at the beginning of this school year and have never regretted a single haircut.  I was really hesitant at first because of the price, but I assure any guy reading this that IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  First time I was there, David sat me down and spent 10 minutes just trying to get an idea of what kind of style works for me.  Being an asian guy, its hard to get a decent haircut with the coarse hair that were known for.  However, David managed to tame my hair and give me a hairstyle thats very easy and most importantly attractive.  He wont give you the typical buzz and spike cut.

Most importantly, David truly cares about how your hair turns out. He usually spends about 45 minutes to an hour cutting my hair, and Im a guy.  $35 is truly a bargain for this kind of attention.

I will never get my haircut anywhere else.  I even plan to commute to Davis when I move back home to get my haircuts by him.

20101217 16:55:10 nbsp Awsome!  Went to get a spiral perm from Thomas.  He made the experience enjoyable, did a wonderful job on my hair and was very good about explaining everything.  I would highly recomend Davids!  They even have student discounts that make it very affordable.  8) Users/sarahbea

20110127 11:42:09 nbsp Thomas is truly the Master Stylist Extraordinaire. I just popped in to get a quick trim and BAM. I look fabulous with a sharp, crisp even cut. Love him and his passion.

20110330 15:04:09 nbsp Best place to get a hair cut. Period.  Users/PavelZastava

20110331 11:45:10 nbsp Today was my first time here and it was a great experience. David knew exactly what kind of style would look good on me and talked me through what he was thinking. Im an asian guy and my hair usually turns out wrong at other places (probably cause I only have to pay $10), but my hair turned out great after coming here. David is incredibly nice and I would recommend him to all the guys out there. Ill definitely be coming back.       Users/iAteHere

20120125 14:30:53 nbsp Got my hair cut here a couple hours ago.  Im sold  Ill be coming back for as long as Im living in the area.   Users/ChanS

20120210 12:19:31 nbsp Went to Davids Haircutting today after making an appointment on Wednesday.  Being a guy, I was kind of reticent to go to such a snazzy haircutting place, but Im glad I did, as I am very impressed.  He spent ten minutes or so discussing what kind of hairstyle I might like, and asking me what I wanted to see if he could work with it.  Ive never had this kind of attention paid to not only what I want, but also what is feasible, when getting a haircut.  Sure enough, by the time he was done, it looked fantastic.  Plus the fact that he uses a straight razor to shave the neck areaunlike, well, everyone else ive ever been towas pretty cool.  It was $35 (+ tip) well spent.  Hes also good at making conversation, nice fellow. Users/ErgotheQualmed

20120518 12:57:32 nbsp Great haircut! One of the best Ive had in a while :) David listens and communicates well, and you end up with exactly what you ask for. And very affordable too! Users/mezb20

20120814 17:37:50 nbsp This guys the real deal passionate about what he does. I will be coming back Users/ChrisRadecke

20120920 09:59:26 nbsp I have been going to David for 8 years now and have always enjoyed the exoerience and the cuts.  he offers a very comfortable atmosphere, great result, and great service.  If i have specifics i want done he is great with them offerring suggestions to my specifics, or if i just want something different but dont know what, he will come up with somethign great and check with me and make it great.   Users/Shinsa

20121004 12:38:18 nbsp $35 minimum for a haircut. No walk ins Users/SydnieMcGuire

20121030 11:05:40 nbsp Had a fantastic cut from David yesterday. So glad I finally found someone local who is competent with mens hair. David is a really genial guy, too  thats an important part of the package. Users/jamesegraham

20140219 19:22:56 nbsp I usually recommend David to men who care about their hair. He offers a pretty good salon experience without any of the pomp and pretense. You wont hear loud house music blaring here but youll still get a shampoo and good cut. Prices are a bit high now ($40 in 2014).

But on my last visit, I left disappointed. I had been growing out my hair for a few months to achieve a new trendy haircut. This style should be getting somewhat common now. I went in with pictures and some questions about weighing my options; I didnt have all the vocab then to explain precisely but we talked through it. David ended up cutting off more hair than I wanted. So I lost several months worth of growth on some parts of my head. Now I have a haircut thats too short and juts out in some parts. And it is uneven on the sides and back. Ill be fixing the sides and back myself. But thanks to this experience I now know a bit more of the vocab Ill need for my next salon visit  I was looking for an undercut. Users/StuckInDavis

20140530 15:18:11 nbsp David is the best in town. You get what you pay for! You wont be sorry Users/BrettPhinney
