Whats up...



I just moved to Davis. I hail from Tucson, AZ...

Just graduated college, and am to see what Davis is all about and how I can help to make it better.

I like the community gardens, the domes, bike church...

I think bicycling should be the main mode of transportation. I think we can do better than Copenhagen. Youtube Copenhagen and you can find some neat videos of what goes on there as far as bicycling/pedestrian power.

Personally I like to be an animal.... run around shoeless barefoot/ climb trees barefoot...

I like to gardening garden. Sing. Dance... Play guitar/drums/piano....

I like to enjoy this gift of life. Because it could be over in a split second..might as well enjoy it.

20070923 15:50:09 nbsp Welcome, David!  Thanks for using your real name!  Doing so definitely helps to increase the quality of the community.

I definitely recommend visiting Copenhagen.   Viewing Youtube videos is cheaper, but I really enjoyed my brief visit there a few years ago.  Like you wrote, their use of bikes is amazing, and the public city library was great too. Users/Graham.Freeman
