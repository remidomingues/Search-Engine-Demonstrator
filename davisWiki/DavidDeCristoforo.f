20080623 16:09:01 nbsp Howdy David.  Out of curiosity, why are you deleting and removing photos from entries? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080623 13:16:49 nbsp Evan, I am trying to use new photos. The old ones are outdated and neither the inside or outside look like that anymore. Why are you insisting on putting these photos back up? I dont understand this. Users/DavidDeCristoforo
   Because its part of the history of Davis... the Wiki isnt a business listing site or anything like that, its a resource for the community.  That includes historical information.  In fact old photos from decades back are uploaded now and then to show how things have changed. The reason that I removed the first person is because other people can, will and are encouraged to edit the entry.  When they edit it, if it is in first person plural (We feel, etc), then it makes it look like the business is saying that.  And since the wiki content is edited by the entire community, that might not be the case.  Theres been a casual and informal Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner set of tips for business owners that gives an unofficial introduction to the wiki that you might want to read.

20080623 13:50:23 nbsp Could you at least allow me to arrange the pictures so that the current ones are at the top? Then I could leave the old ones on the page . Users/DavidDeCristoforo

20080624 09:09:06 nbsp Ah, I arranged those around because people with smaller monitors cant see anything until they scroll down if there are two huge photos at the top (and on smaller monitors, those are huge).  They also pinch the text if you have a nonmaximized browser.  Basically, those particular move down images edits were to make the entry more reader friendly to a wider audience. Users/JabberWokky
