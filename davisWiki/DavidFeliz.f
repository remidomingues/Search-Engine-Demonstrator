Howdy David, and Welcome to the Wiki!  I started to groan when I saw the new entry you made was copied from Wikipedia (for boring Copyrights legal reasons, you cant just copy stuff from Wikipedia, and it is a fairly common newcomer mistake).  Then I noticed that you were the original author and photographer (which makes it perfectly fine).  Im very happy you decided to contribute your beautiful photos and detailed information to your home town wiki.  There was a community effort to rework the various animal pages that sort of stalled over the holidays.  Your contributions reminded me to see if that effort can get rolling again.  Weve already got an extensive writeup on the town flora.  Welcome to the wiki, and thanks again for the contribution! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

Thanks for contributing!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080127 12:53:39 nbsp Thanks Evan. I was hoping that this page would be a jumping off point, so it should quickly evolve away from the Wikipedia base article. I will try to contribute towards the local town flora write up.   Users/DavidFeliz
