20111226 18:46:37 nbsp Yes, welcome!  I think you might wish to read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner.  It will help explain the changes that were made to the page for your business. Users/CovertProfessor

20111226 19:20:51 nbsp Hey David.

You can also review all the changes made to any page by clicking the info button up by the title.  When you get to the info page, you can use the little radio buttons to select different versions and see all the changes that occurred between them.  It also lists who made changes, and why (if editor chose to comment about it).  Took me a little while to discover that too, but its very useful. Users/jefftolentino
