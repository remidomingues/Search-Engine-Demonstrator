This editor can edit this entry and tell us a bit about themselves by clicking the Edit icon.


Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, David, and Welcome to the Wiki!   I reverted your edit to Users/Gabriella because you didnt leave any reason as to why you were editing her personal entry.  Normally editing the personal entry of another editor in such a manner is frowned on.  Its possible she asked you to edit it, which would make it okay, but you didnt mention any reason when you deleted a bunch of her entry.  It might be a good idea to note the reason for your edit in the edit comment (the field just below the editor, just above the Save Changes button).  Basically, right now it is unclear if you were vandalizing her entry (possibly just kidding around), or if youre acting on her behalf.   If its something she wants, please feel free to do the edit again (and let people know that youre doing it with her consent... the reason your edit was undone was to protect the entry she created).  In general, however, welcome to the wiki, and I hope you enjoy the community!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
