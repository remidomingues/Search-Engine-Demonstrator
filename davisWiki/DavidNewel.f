The Reference of Some Guy Named David Newel



Hello, my name is David Newel, and this is my wiki page. You probably came across this at random or by accident. Thats quite unfortunate because I tend to ramble on and on, and now you have to read it. Oh well...

Unnecessary History

I was born in wiki:Chicago, Illinois. I was a common pasty young nerd then and often times got beaten up by other students, most of which were thirteenyearolds that were held back for a rather long time to still be in the fourth grade.

By fifth grade, I moved over to California and left my childhood friends. I never saw them again. However, I did become a Math geek and reading nerd and didnt get beat up for it, although I was still treated like crap. Forced to step in it sometimes too.

Then, in Junior High, I was a general science geek, and started taking an interest in one of the CAD classes offered (forced onto me) by the school I was at. My best friend then got suspended from school for wearing a trench coat during the time of the Columbine shootings, and then his parents and he moved to Washington and I barely saw any of them ever again.

Later on, I made another friend in high school. He got suspended for crossdressing in school for Halloween, somewhere during the 1940s, because the school still believed it was in that era. His mother moved him to another school, and I rarely see him, but still do occasionally.

In high school, I became a writing geek, a theater freak, an artist, a pianoplayer, a choir member, and spent my senior year suffering through AP classes for the first time while everybody else was having fun.

The story continues as I make my way to college. Although accepted to UC Davis, I was strapped for cash, so I went to a junior college. For some reason, I decided to pursue Computer Science, and I never really made friends there. Id probably never see them again, anyways. Likely, those that I made friends with will have dropped out or moved on by now. Its unfortunate...

As of right now, I am a junior at UC Davis, and my major is Computer Science. Youll probably never see this story again, and Ill probably never see you, either. Theres a moral in this...

Ill probably come up with one if I ever see this wiki again.

What am I up to now?

Stressing out over going from a semester to a quarter system. Rethinking choice of major. Not having an especially great time doing it either. Many deadlines coming up, and I was apparently supposed to have started working on them weeks before I ever realized their existence.

What would I prefer to be doing?

Designing games. Oh, I forgot to mention that, didnt I? Yeah... I design video games for a hobby. Lets not be too amazed by that thought. By design, I mean struggle an extreme amount over a frustrating project, only to find I dont enjoy working on it and by games I mean items that people ultimately find frustrating to play, only to find they dont enjoy playing it. By video I mean computer because Ive yet to figure a way to program a games console.

Unfortunately, I dont really have any of my stuff online. That would probably be a more productive project to pursue. By pursue, I mean ultimately find I dont enjoy making.
