David Nguyen is a fourthyear Political Science/Economics double major at UC Davis.  This is his final year at UCD and hes currently considering possibly Stay In Davis continuing his Davis residency after graduation.

David currently is the Business Manager and a DJs DJ at KDVS.  He operates under the alias DJ EndStop and his show http://www.kdvs.org/shows/view/show_id/246/ (Life is) Full of Possibilities can be heard Thursdays from 2:30pm4:30pm every week (on 90.3 FM in the Sacto area or live via internet streaming, btw). He likes to think of the the program as an eclectic pop show, so tune in if you like that stuff.  The Spring 2008 quarter will be his tenth quarter onair and could likely be his last for an indefinite amount of time, although a small part of him dreams he could DJ forever, like Gary Saylin.

He I Love Davis loves Davis because he finds the town to be quite swell.  Extraordinary, in fact.  If there wasnt good thrifting nearby and good live music in the area, hed probably be bored, though.

His legal first name actually is Davis, although he only uses that name to pay the bills and turn in homework.  A rather small coincidence.
