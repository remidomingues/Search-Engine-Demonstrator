20090113 19:39:40 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/JasonAller

20090113 19:49:10 nbsp The other option you could use is to create a redirect for the second name for the business to the existing page. Just create the new page with the other name and insert {{{#redirect Village Cab}}} alone on the page. Users/JasonAller

20090113 20:11:13 nbsp Ok, it looks like the only thing we cant fix is the left over page you created called Village Cab // 530753TAXI 24HOUR SVC. There is something about using two slashes together like that in a page name that causes problems. Maybe you can ask Users/PhilipNeustrom to fix that. Users/JasonAller

20090113 20:21:21 nbsp thanks alot for helping me out with this. im not adept enough obviuosly, but if you could help me get the 530753TAXI in the title it would help. I am getting hits on this part of my biz name through the phonebook and some places on the web. Users/DavidPlacencia

20090113 20:24:26 nbsp {{{530753TAXI 24Hour Service}}} does redirect to Village Cab now. Can you ask Philip to clean up that one extra page? Users/JasonAller

20110318 09:00:03 nbsp I can understand your serious concern regarding the recent comment on Village Cab, David.  As a brief bit of information: While some reports like these are from anonymous editors (and thus often deleted due to lack of support), Ashley is a fairly prominent public figure among UCD students, active in student government and several student organizations.  This is not an anonymous anecdote. It would appear she is personally standing by her story.  It would be a good idea to verify that she posted it, although I cant imagine that anybody who obtained unintended access her account would post something of this nature.  By the way, an honest statement is never libel, and legal intimidation is generally frowned upon on the wiki.  On the other hand, figuring out what happened is pretty important.  Who knows  the drivers significant other may have been the fare, and he felt guilty about kissing her on duty!  Or you may face the unpleasant task dealing with a driver who did something youll need to deal with.  Best of luck.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org (814) 8898845

20110321 13:00:26 nbsp I agree that she should have been more willing to talk with you to resolve this rather than deciding to take her ball and go home. But whats done is done. I can only hope shell decide to contact you directly at some point to resolve this. Thank you sir.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20110321 13:16:16 nbsp Deleting the Village Cab page is not an option, much as you might wish for that to happen.  Users/DonShor

20110321 13:21:11 nbsp David, you do not own the entry about Village Cab any more than you own a review in the Enterprise written about Village Cab.  Please do not destroy community content. Users/JabberWokky

20110321 13:27:24 nbsp Yes, but the entry is about Village Cab, in the same way an article about Village Cab in the Enterprise is about the company, but does not belong to the company.  The vast majority of entries on the wiki about businesses were created by, and are maintained by, members of the community.  PLEASE READ Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  Many people have asked you to do so, and it would clarify many things. Users/JabberWokky

20110321 13:32:56 nbsp David, the comment and your response, IMO, are actually fine now. She has made her point, you as business owner have given a reasoned reply. Had the whole thing gone down this way from the start, much ill will could have been avoided. You can add to your comment at any time, but I really thing the backandforth stands well on its own at this time. I certainly understand your frustration about this whole episode.  Users/DonShor

20110321 13:46:07 nbsp Davidits not our responsibility if she doesnt respond. If she doesnt respond, you are stuck where you are. Youve done your best to respond professionally. I would just move on. Users/PeterBoulay

20110321 14:05:53 nbsp You have the same control over content that I have.  The same control anybody has.  You can add, delete and revert the same as me.  Just like everybody else can.  Thats why it has to come to rest at some point.  (And by the way, Peter uses our  keep in mind that ANYBODY on the wiki always speaks for themselves).  Sometimes the more experienced folk can predict how things will go because theyve seen similar situations before, but theres no absolute here.  Ive guessed wrong which way the wind is blowing too many times to think I can speak for everybody else en masse.   And thats the crux: I dont get my way all the time, nor will you.  Nor does anybody who edits more than a few times.  There are many different opinions, all held by many different people... all with the exact same rights and capabilities to edit the same content.  Thats why finding a solution to some issues is so darn hard. Users/JabberWokky

20110321 14:10:14 nbsp Id suggest sitting on it for a while.  Give it a few days, and see if you hear anything more from Ashley.  Based on the information there, I know it must be almost impossible for you to investigate, so hopefully shell follow up.  The one discussion that didnt really occur on the Talk page was what to actually do with the content.  Everyone got too caught up in other disputes, tempers ran high, and the whole thing got pretty nasty.  I think everyone involved could do with a wiki chill pill (which seems to already be happening, thankfully).  If nothing has changed in a few days, a week, whatever, bring it up again.  My impression is that Im not the only one who was somewhat troubled by the lack of detail in the comment, and the problems that inherently creates for you in investigating and replying.  After a little time passes, my hope is that there can be a calm discussion of the content, rather than superseding issues.  For the time being, as a couple people have noted, youve responded well on the page.  Theres no urgency.  I know the feeling of needing to get it resolved, but at this point further backandforth is unlikely to accomplish anything.

I wouldnt agree with what I took from Petes its not our problem comment; give it some time, revisit it if things havent changed, and see what people think when tempers arent running hot. Users/TomGarberson
    Let me clarifyif she doesnt come back or speak up further, theres simply not a lot that the Wiki can do. This feels more and more like a hit and run attack by Ashley and I for one dont like it. I think your best way to address it is to find her and speak to her personally. PeteB

20110321 15:34:58 nbsp in my heart of hearts i do believe something wrong is happening here. I appreciate your Voluntary commentary and your interest in the vivacity of the wiki. I am sure you are all very busy people with real tangible lives. I dont know why the comments shouldnt be posted to ashleys page as her own personal opinions, and if she decides at some later time to unfold her story with investigable facts, then her page can be restored and she can as easily then publicize her facts. reposting her story in its present form is
already creating confusion and backlash within some of my ridership. She is an adult who chose to send in a story, and unless theres backline contact with her noone else can
see evidence of here, we cant infer why she chose to unPage herself. She isnt accusing a driver, but an entire business, and it implies an endless number of things that noone can defend against. I appreciate your comments, but I obviusly dont have any power over the editorial decision making process, and this also feels wrong. Someone likened this to a newspaper article, but i think a newspaper may at least investigate facts before allowing a destructive story to go to print, and enabling what is now a voyeuristic spectacle surrounding a business reputation being put into question. thank you for reading and thinking and volunteering. Users/DavidPlacencia

20110321 18:43:53 nbsp I am trying to do the best I can to be neutral in the recent issue on the business page and am also trying to work with the community as a whole to come up with more workable solutions to issues similar to it as a whole. Trust me when I say that it took a lot for me not to attack the allegation as complete BS in my attempt to be neutral. I know you personally and also know you would not tolerate anything of the sort, but I cannot sit back and attack the accuser or the accused in this or any other issue that arises.

I have been a member of the DavisWiki for a long time and know it to be a valuable resource for all, I also know that from time to time it is imperfect and always will be. We are all trying to work together to find a way for it to become as close as possible to this ideal.  You did your part to clear the business name and reputation. Users/WesP

20110321 19:09:00 nbsp Recent events in Libya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Japan, Iraq & the Supermoon, and this intense situation all make me think about the aspects of life when perspectives all overlap, contradict, and enrage...Akira Kurusawas     Rashomon. Users/DavidPlacencia

20110321 19:12:00 nbsp Rashomon, and the summer of 1991 in Davis. Good Luck! Users/JasonAller

20110321 23:54:36 nbsp The Talk/Talk page was just a test example to look for a better way of discussing things.  It wasnt real.  Sorry if it confused you. Users/JabberWokky

20110322 12:09:17 nbsp Thats the thing David, I cannot end the vote. I was looking for a resolution and feel your recent comment on the main page may suffice. I stated such on the top of the talk page. Hopefully it comes to an end soon.  Personally, I think its gone on long enough.   Users/WesP

20110322 12:10:11 nbsp And that rewrite, sir, gained my immediate respect.  That was a very classy, seriously well thought out way to address the situation.  I have no idea how it will play out, but it is a phenomenal example of paying attention and trying to find a solution that addresses the various concerns different individuals have voiced about this issue. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20110322 12:18:41 nbsp I echo JWs sentiments.   Users/OliviaY

20110322 13:36:25 nbsp Im also very impressed with your rewrite. Nice job! Users/ScottMeehleib

20110322 18:23:31 nbsp Nothing anyone can do about it unless he clarifies what he is saying no to. Users/WesP

20110327 17:38:48 nbsp Hey David, I switched the email addresses on Village Cab back to the {{{Mailto(villagecabdavis AT gmail DOT com)}}} format.  Its macro that makes the page display a proper email address, but doesnt appear to be an actual email address to automated programs that search the interwebs for email address to sell to spammers.  If you look at the page, youll see that it displays as a linked email address, as intended.  This way, it just keeps spambots from seeing it that way. Users/TomGarberson

20110327 17:39:51 nbsp Whoops, sorry, apparently I jumped the gunyou werent done editing yet.  Ill let you finish up.  If you need any help, just shout. Users/TomGarberson

20110328 12:45:03 nbsp thanks...i figured somebody out there would lend a hand...im still learning...like it wasnt
obvious i guess Users/DavidPlacencia

20110328 12:49:13 nbsp We all are :) Users/TomGarberson

20110422 11:25:29 nbsp It looks like another visit to the talk page is needed.  In the interest of keeping the conversation in one place, rather than on multiple user pages, I went ahead and recreated Village Cab/Talk, and replied to your comment to CP. Users/TomGarberson

20110422 11:52:36 nbsp You can add text directly into any page by clicking on the Edit button next to the pages title.  It makes it easier to respond directly to people, because you can add your text immediately after theirs.  To indent your reply, just add a space to the start of what youre writing.  Additional indentation just requires one extra space.  For example:
 This has one space
  This has two spaces
You can also add an asterisk () after the space, before your text, to create bullet points.  They can make it clear where your comment starts.
  One space and an asterisk
   Two spaces and an asterisk
This way, its fairly easy to follow a conversation, particularly with multiple people joining in.  If this is my statement, and you and several other people reply...
  Your reply might look like this
   If I reply to you, it could go here
  Covert Professor might reply to my initial comment as well, so CP would just indent once
Basically, just click to edit the page, scroll down to just below the comment to which youre replying, add one more space onto however many they had, and type away.  Hope that helps! Users/TomGarberson

20110422 14:05:42 nbsp If you think that no one acts altruistically, then I am very sorry for you.  You have a very negative impression of human beings and their behaviors.  I acted in accordance with what I took to be the previous consensus.  If the new consensus is that the comment should be removed, then I will agree with that.  But please, lets keep the discussion on the Talk page.  It becomes very confusion for other editors who  yes, care  and are trying to follow what is going on.  I am very sorry to hear about your mother.  Please accept my condolences for your loss. Users/CovertProfessor

20110422 14:12:29 nbsp I just brought it up myself, on the talk page.  As for the tone of my reply, I was just astonished that you could have been through that whole discussion and failed to learn the first thing about how the wiki works  you are not a newbie here.  And I would never presume to participate in something like this before first figuring out what its all about. Users/CovertProfessor

20110422 15:37:47 nbsp Sorry, trying to get a couple of motions filed before 4:30, so I havent been very responsive.  Ill try and follow up this evening, or tomorrow. Users/TomGarberson

20110422 23:43:47 nbsp Davis Wiki can be very frustrating to business owners, and you are dealing with a prime example of the problems with ad hoc management. Nobodys in charge, so everybodys in charge, but not really. Nevertheless, its best to keep participating. Take care. Users/DonShor

20110425 11:04:09 nbsp Do you have any data that would show the magnitude of the impact this comment has had on Village Cab?  Something like calls per day over a period of a few weeks prior to and after the comment was left?  Obviously its up to you whether you want to start divulging business records here.  It might be useful to have a concrete frame of reference when you guys talk about getting fewer calls, though. Users/TomGarberson
  I talked to a driver who mentioned that he was asked about it... I personally found that to be a pretty important aspect. jw

20110425 13:39:15 nbsp i understand the spirit of the request. but there is no way any drop in business is attributable to this directly. All i do know is the obvious. We have been providing as much clarification as the original story does, if not more. the real point from a business perspective is how can anyone track what PERCEPTION and FIRST iMPRESSION has on someone when they click past our page for another ? The point further is that thw WiKi wasnt equipped to handle this kind of QuAsiLibel and I cant stomach my business being objectified and studied like some insect in a lab experiment. The facts are there are no facts. And i am sorry i turned toward looking at Ashleys page to see who she
was and found mainly acid & vinegar. I brought up the pejorative nature of some other accusations she had
made and no effort then was made to create and Accusations Page. But i am
glad its being done now. But if these matters arent considered from a viewpoint of FAIRnESS, then what pray tell, IS  going on here?
In an effort to follow due diligence i wrote a comment that avoided WhiteWashing the issue & made a very public commitment to placing cameras in our cabs by fiscal years end.
Village Cab has had 0 legal or integrity issues against us on public or private records beside a couple of fixit tickets.
It has been over 30 days since the vote to allow my revision, but that wasnt a permanent decision. No new helpful evidence has been shown to SOLVE the questions left behind by ashleys story, and I have personally had 2 corporate clients (which is not prudent of me to divulge) about how founded in truth the storys claims are. I have just lost my mother, who helped me and inspired me to start this business, and i am heartbroken that this much exposure of a dubious nature is persisting in light of little FACT and much emotion. I can not vouch for anyone who doesnt take a license plate, a phone number, a cab number, or even describe the physical elements necessary for tangible conclusions to be
made. It is not prudent to conjecture DOLLARS lost from people who are just calling someone else. But As I have said before, why do we have to prove specifics when its not being demanded of the accuser? wiki editors recieve no legal training , no academic guidance before they attain their titles of Community Member or such. There was no caution offered to anyone wanting to expose wrongdoing against a business. It has circulated enough! You guys know the clicks and who views what...you can see the number of page views, etc. no? It is not right that our name is being dragged through the mud for so long, is it?
  Users/DavidPlacencia

20110426 13:55:07 nbsp No problem.  I dont particularly care about the drama, I just want whatever resolution is best for the community.  As long as people are voting on that criterion, and not out of anger or stubbornness, I completely respect their opinion, be it to keep the comment or to remove it.  Im apparently the only one who likes option 3 :) Users/TomGarberson

20110919 11:07:02 nbsp Hey David, mind chiming in over at Wiki Community/Cabs? What kind of information should be on cabs pages in terms of licenses and such? Also, would you mind explaining in what situations a cab needs an SMF license/transponder thingy? Users/WilliamLewis

20110919 12:09:40 nbsp I kind of kicked your comment suggestion over to Wiki Community/Cabs.  The information is certainly awkward on the cab entries, but its reasonable to collect.  Perhaps a dedicated entry that demystifies the regulations and lays out what exists in Davis (both the regulations and how the local cab services are filed) makes more sense than trying to put info and a full explanation on each individual entry. Users/JabberWokky

20120830 14:22:48 nbsp David, I added a comment bar to the Davis taxi page. You can post a comment now.  Users/LoriOrf
