20081219 20:48:27 nbsp Actually, I was just more concerned with identifying the editor so that the complex tangle of accounts doing dubious edits can be figured out.  There are quite a few oddball edits that are occurring on that entry.  Its actually pretty typical to tag entries that are suspicious so that the more casual reader is informed about the source.  This particular case is certainly borderline; were there not a web of already questioned edits, I wouldnt have bothered.  Borderline enough so Im not going to restore them, but it does make it harder to understand those last two comments.  If you want to remove the details, you might want to add a comment to the effect that there was comment deletion and restoration, or those two dont make sense.
