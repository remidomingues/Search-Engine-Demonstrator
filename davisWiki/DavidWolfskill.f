20100205 nbsp Howdy David, and welcome to the wiki.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding a really neat bit of information to the entry about the Wolfskill Experimental Orchard entry.  Always feel free to click the Edit button and add things directly to the entry... everything on the wiki was added by people like you, sharing what they know about Davis.  I moved what you wrote up into the main entry and added some Wanted links... those dashed underlines mean that if you click the link, you can create a new entry about the topic.  That means that you can click the dashed links and start new entries about John Reid Wolfskill and/or John W. Wolfskill, and anybody else can help you out.  The entire wiki is build by and for the community, and youre part of the community, so it would be great if you could share what you know about this neat little bit of local history.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
