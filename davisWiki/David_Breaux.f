David Breaux (aka Compassion Guy) is a Stanford University graduate and Davis resident who can be found standing on the southeast corner of Third Street Third & C Street C Streets (Compassion Corner) asking people what their definition of compassion is. He has had a compilation book published with writings from this experience.  He hopes that it will be the first of many.

He is also the creator of Compassion Bench located there. It was built by many volunteers in 2013.

David in Action


20110331 19:34:39 nbsp So strange to become aware of how little we know of others, let alone ourselves. It is easy to walk around, see someone, feel you understand them by their appearance and continue on our way, never realizing what they are truly doing, who they truly are. This is what happened with David.

I would walk by the corner of 3rd and C streets often in daily/weekly walks around town and would often see this man standing there. At first glance, you say to yourself, Oh great, another homeless man looking for a handout. David, however, never asked me for anything until about 3 weeks ago. I was walking by and he asked me if I cared to write a few words about compassion. I thought about it for a second, jokingly told him that compassion was hurting yourself by helping others, but pondered what it truly was for me. I grabbed the pen, wrote in his journal what I truly felt compassion was  a selfsacrificing love for others as we love ourselves and carried on with my day. Little did I know that this seemingly homeless man was far from it.

I picked up the Davis Enterprise this afternoon and found that he has been working on this book, now complete, that he has been working on for the past two years. It makes one think about the assumptions we all make in a simple glance. Now I wonder how many others have missed an opportunity for growth by the assumption we all make based on appearances alone.  I wish David the best in his endeavor. Users/WesP

Not for long  David is taking his passion for compassion on tour in a couple of weeks.  As I recall, the plan is to do monthlong stints in various cities across the U.S. over the next year.  Ill miss his steady presence at 3rd & C! Users/JimFrame
