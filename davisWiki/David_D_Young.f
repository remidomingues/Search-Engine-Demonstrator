KDVS resident Beat Poetry poet from the Midwest, David is the host of http://kdvs.org/shows/view/show_id/578 Upper Realm Shrieks: Music & Words. He is well loved at the station and on the airwaves for his shows idiosyncratic style, with his theatrical air breaks and the unconventional, eclectic logic of his song progressions. He occasionally publishes poetry in KDViationS.

Hes played music on numerous recordings, including triangles, bell tree, claves, ting, sha, tambourine, industrial kitchen equipment, and toys on Chip Handys P(MM). He often comes to music events around town.

He has many interesting stories to tell from his years spent in Berkeley and Chicago.

He works at the Silo on campus.



David is super cool for sure, trounced some cancer!   You should listen to his show!Users/StevenDaubert
