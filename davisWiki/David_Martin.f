David has worked in Davis for over 20 years.  He started as an apprentice with Bunny Jean Cunningham, of J. Cunningham Hair Salon at her downtown salon, J. Cunningham & Co., on the second floor of the Mansion Square Center, in 1987.  David worked with Jean for 4 years before moving to the salon that he would work in for the next fifteen years, All That Jaz.  He owned All That Jaz under the name All That Hair Artistry for the last five years he was there. After selling All That/Hair Artistry, David moved back downtown and worked briefly with Roxie Battaglia in her downtown salon, Roxies, before leaving to work with his friend Tenaya Freitas, at Davids Haircutting, in the Orange Court Center.  David and Tenaya moved to Salon At Maple Court the following year.  Here he would work with his old friends and mentors from J. Cunningham & Co., Sharon Jackson, and Cecilia Scott.  When circumstances forced them out of their H Street location David opened his own salon, Cobalt Salon & Gallery and invited his friends Tenaya, Sharon, and Cecilia to join him.

He is planning on staying at his current location for many, many, years.

David specializes in:

  color correction
  hilighting, lolighting, paneling, baliage, ombre, and blockcolor techniques
  (very rarely) styling for special occasions such as updos and/or wedding hairstyles (full or half day packages if within a few hours drive) or for a night out.
  both wet and dry cutting and razor techniques.  I love Curly hair, too!!

20070515 18:44:11 nbsp Ive been going to David for longer than I care to remember.  Hes taken great care of my hair, and he makes it look nice even when it (the hair) suddenly adopts a new growth pattern!  Last summer I got some strange new waves to my hair when we cut it short for a trip.  It looked good even when I didnt blow it dry.  He also has good advice for keeping it healthy. Users/Christal

20070623 13:19:46 nbsp Ive been going to David for a haircut since I moved to Davis.  I have always been happy with the results! Users/DanWillenbring

20071103 21:31:03 nbsp I highly recommend David to all my friends. I LOVE my new haircut. I always had long hair as a child so I was very nervous about having short hair. I brought in pictures and told him roughly what I wanted. I ended up having a hair cut that was EXACTLY what I wanted. He will listen to how you want your hair and tell you all you need to know about what would look best for you. I am very excited to show everyone my new hair cut.  Users/tessa

20071210 12:53:49 nbsp I went to David for a cut last week.  I have curly hair and usually wear it short.  Most barbers/stylists dont know what to do with it.  David did a great job!  In addition to the great cut, the overall experience was wonderful.  I felt very comfortable and relaxed while there. Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20080105 07:30:49 nbsp David always gets it right! I leave his salon loving my hair. Thanks David! Users/CaryArnold

20080319 16:20:23 nbsp I LOVE him! He does such a great job. I went to David to have may hair cut short and it turned out amazing. I would definitely recommend him.  Users/atnuech

20081104 09:36:22 nbsp All I can say is WOW!  David is amazing!  He performed magic on my hair for my wedding.  He made me feel like a total princess.  He not only did my hair but did 5 bridesmaids, 3 moms and two flower girls (with lots of help from my friend Sharon Gamble!!David).  He is totally professional and I cant believe how much he was able to do in a few hours!  I would highly recommend David to everyone I know!  Thank you David  you helped turn my day into a dream! Users/CaraJones

20081114 19:02:01 nbsp I went in for anything different.  David talked with me and was quite funny and friendly.  But most importantly, he gave me the most amazing haircut.  Its different from what I had before and totally me.  I DEFINITELY recommend him. Users/Tanguera

20090123 20:54:30 nbsp I have difficult hair to work with and I want some pretty challenging cuts. I asked him to mimic a photo of a previous cut with some alterations. He was able to handle the cut and do in 1.5 hours what took 2.5 at a highend salon in Austin (at a lower price too). David Martin is an artist. Users/Stefphanni

20090413 09:56:27 nbsp I had my first appointment with David just over two weeks ago  the cut and highlights were exactly what I wanted, the colour is particularly gorgeous! He was great to chat with, would highly recommend. Users/LizA

20090807 06:56:43 nbsp I was referred to David by a friend.  He did an outstanding job on her hair, especially on the color.  Now it is two weeks after my own appt. with him and I am very happy with both the cut and color.  I also appreciate how he gets his clients.  He listens.  Really listens.  My husband was, and still is, thrilled with Davids work.  He doesnt typically comment on my hair, but he calls me glamorous.  There have been subsequent date nights and a romantic weekend on the Mendocino coast.  With a three yearold in tow, but what the heck.  I recommend David without reservation, especially if you have fine hair and want to work with a true professional. Users/MrsC

20090811 17:28:18 nbsp Ive worked with David for years. Hes great. Very conscientious. He listens and finds out exactly what it is you want.   Users/TenayaFreitas

20100109 19:24:04 nbsp David is fantastic. He is an extremely talented hair stylist and colorist.  And a super nice guy too!  I highly recommend David.   Users/EBP

20100416 21:14:24   I have been devoted to Davids hair styling since I moved to Davis and feel that I was so lucky to have chosen him. I trust him completely and he never fails to put a smile on my face when I get out of his salon. Not only he is in total command of his craft, he completely devotes himself to make his clients happy. The quality of his professional work is exceptional. —ascaglione@ucdavis.edu

20100429 22:05:59 nbsp Had my first appointment with David today and must say that I love the work that he did with the color and cut. Super professional and knows what he is doing. I highly recommend him. Users/Yuriko

20100929 16:01:11   David is WONDERFUL! I got a hair cut with him as a gift from a friend and I couldnt be happier. He is professional, funny, kind, and really knows about hair! My boyfriend decided he finally needed to cut off his pony tail but was nervous as he hadnt had short hair in nearly a decade. He went to David for a consult and cut and came away with a great cut that works perfectly with his type of hair. I would highly recommend David! —SaraRoscoe

20110323 08:26:19 nbsp I try to search for a good salon in Davis. First of all, I chose Luci salon because my friends said they know how to style your hair. However, as I went online, I saw lots of good reviews about the Cobalt salon, so I decided to change my mind and go to this salon instead. It turns out that I got the worst haircut ever from this place. Although I brought the picture with me to the place, my haircut turns out so short and not even looks like the picture. It is completely a crazy short hair without any styling or any creative,or not even look like the pictures that I brought ( I brought 2 pictures, but if its not possible to cut as the pix, just tell me before the process, and dont say that its possible, but then it turns out to be worst at the end)The fullness of the hair in the back is also weird; the half top is flatted, and the half bottom is having fullness. My mom and aunts also agree so. I was crying whenever I look at the mirror.

I have to go to my regular stylist to ask if he can fix it for me, but it is impossible because if he fixes the hair, it will even shorter. Afterward, I had to go to Sally to ask for a shampoo to induce hair grow so it can grow faster and i can fix it. This is the first time that I have to pay for an expensive haircut and I dont like it at all. Im so disappointed, upset, and sorry for my self for not going to the suggested salon or stay with my stylist in my hometown.... So, Be careful with all the good reviews online.
PS. the owner, Davis is nice and friendly, hes just not a good hair stylist Users/ChauDoan

Ms. Doan, I am so very sorry for your bad experience with your haircut.  As I stated in the email I sent you, I would be happy to  refund your money if you do not want me to fix any problems with your cut.
 David Martin, owner

20110324 12:10:14 nbsp Id like to take a moment to come to Davids defense regarding the above comment.  David is wonderful and kind and has obviously tried to make things right with this unsatisfied customer.  Ive had bad hair cuts before (never from David) so I know how upsetting it can be, especially if you get a really short dramatic hair cut.  But David is a very talented stylist and I think her rant is unwarranted.  Also, hes only received one bad review in years of amazing styling, dont take it too hard David.   Users/SaraRoscoe
  How do you know her rant is unwarranted?  Everyone has a bad day, even the best of us, at what we do.  Perhaps she really wasnt satisfied with her hair and ya know what, thats alright in the grand scheme of things.  No one business is going to please everyone.users/OliviaY

20110324 13:12:31 nbsp Im in agreement with Sara on this one also. Ive been having David cut my hair for over a year now and have bringing my mother into him for nearly as long. Both of us have loved every single hair cut. Hes been a great listener, very knowledgeable, professional, and is funny and kind as well. Before David I was terrified of every little snip of my hair and now I look forward to working with him every time I get my hair cut. David, please dont let one bad review get you down because the rest of us think youre amazing! Users/ElysiaFrink

20110325 03:07:55 nbsp I call shannigans on Doans post. Youre so upset that youre going to create 5 new accounts on different sites and copy and paste your review in 5 different spots? And then refuse to take a refund? People lose creditability imo when they specifically reference other stylists/salons in a review. Nice plug.

While I do appreciate Bretts defense of me, I dont believe the salon referenced in Ms. Doans edit had anything to do with her review.David Martin

David is a good hair stylist. Maybe hes not good for you (hmmm). But you cant generalize for everyone else. Or try to discount all the good reviews for one bad (laughable).

Not only is David one of best cutter/stylists both me and my gf have ever been to. Hes pretty badass at color too. I should know cause ive had twotone mohawks and weve had all sorts of styles and colors.

Bottom line. David rocks. Users/BrettBretterson
