20100825 08:32:33 nbsp As an insurance agent David has gone above and beyond getting our family set up with the right insurance. He has been very helpful in patiently explaining all aspects of the insurance and whatever else I as homeowner, car owner... need to consider to be prepared for the unexpected. Ive known him for several years now and find him to be of the highest integrity and very involved in the local community.  Users/gold

20110121 10:48:05 nbsp David Pinto is a terrific agent who makes sure you have the right fit in coverage, and backs it up with great customer service. When we were shopping for home and car insurance, David took the time to explain all the nuances of each aspect of coverage better than Ive ever had before. He made sure we had the right amount and type of coverage for our situation, AND got us a better rate that our current CSAA policy. I now understand what we have, and can make informed decision on what we do and dont need. David also provides terrific followup service. He helped us with liability coverage for a onetime event  no problem! And when our car broke down in a remote park, he connected us to a towing company (even though I had neglected to add the roadside service policy, my bad!). Ive heard other friends speak highly of his service. Ill happily continue to recommend David. Users/RamonaS
