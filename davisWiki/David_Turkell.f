 California Aggie Endorsement 

David Turkell: Turkells current connections with state legislators assure us that he will actually advocate, and bring students with him. He plans to arrange carpools to the capitol and set up dialogue with various representatives and we hope to see this happen. He will bring a unique quality to the senate table both in his focus on state advocacy and his cultural backgrounds.

As both a Latino and member of a fraternity, he could serve as a liaison between underrepresented and Greek communities.

PLATFORMS:

Increase the Level of Dialogue between Davis and Sacramento

We need to shut down the divide between the Causeway. As prospective students, several of us came to UC Davis with the hope of one day pursuing a future in Politics. However, when the public policy branch of the UC Sacramento center was suspended due to budgetary concerns, many of us students felt as though our voices were not heard. If I am elected, I vow to work to bring back this vital program. If there is more dialogue with the capitol, legislators will realize that they are not just raising fees for some random number, they are raising the fees for hardworking, young individuals who are the future of tomorrow.

Sacramento is not only an important resource for IR and Poly Sci oriented students. It is a shame that there are many students who graduate from prime departments such as the college of engineering that end up (after 4 or 5 years of solid learning) having to work in places such as crate n barrel just to support themselves as well as their family while they struggle to find an employment opportunity that truly meets their qualifications. There are many Sacramento firms in fields such as engineering that are looking to hire highly qualified individuals, yet these organizations don’t apprehend the fact that there is a pool of ready and eager individuals right here in Davis.

More Bike Pumps on Campus

Have you ever had a bike that constantly needs to be refilled with air, yet you don’t have a way of pumping up your tires back at home? Though there are some oncampus bike pumps (outside various dorms and the bike barn), many students do not know about these available resources or live far off campus. As the world’s most bikefriendly campus, it is imperative that the university continues to make students aware of the bike support services that are already available in order to ensure campus safety.

Increasing Retention, Improving Affordability

The recent and unprecedented 32% fee increase has hit UC students hard and many are looking at the prospect of having to withdraw to save money. One way to ease this burden would be to lower the unit requirement for good standing from 13 to 12. This would allow working students a better chance to stay in school by creating a better opportunity to balance work and academics while keeping aid as a full time student.

Tutoring Expansion

With recent cuts to the Learning Skills Center and students forced to work longer to pay for college, student academic achievement is at risk. The first method would be to create a partnership between the University and the private sector in the community by encouraging sponsorship from local businesses with an investment in UC Davis. Additionally, we would comb the university budget for waste and find reasonable solutions for reduction. The second method would be creating a tutoring program assisted on a volunteer basis by administrators and faculty. Not only would this program enable administrators to interact with students, but it would also gives students a greater opportunity to work with worldclass faculty. These combined programs would allow for expanded hours of available tutors in challenging courses which are critical to large segments of the student population.

Advocating Student Concerns to the Regents

Although ASUCDs University Affairs unit has been representing the perspective of students in the Regents meetings, it has struggled to gain the same privileges that other UCs enjoy. We will fight to gain the ability to speak closely with the regents without forced membership in expensive and ineffective UC Student Association.
