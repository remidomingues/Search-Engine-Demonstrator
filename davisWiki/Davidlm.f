20070624 10:42:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, as a business owner you might want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Can you explain why you dont want a link from Hair By David Martin to wiki:Sacramento:the Spa at Davids? Users/JasonAller

20070624 12:01:12 nbsp no problem.  I work at Davids Haircutting with another David.  Dont want the confusion of Davids there, so I dont have a Davids Haircutting link at the very top.  As to the spa, thats located in my private Sac residence where I see certain clients, ie. friends and clients of over a few years, I dont want new or unknown clients going to the spa website in Sac as soon as they get to my Davis Wiki page.  Make sense, no?  If not let me know why and Ill be happy to consider changing my opinion.   Users/Davidlm

20070719 17:29:50 nbsp As a client, i think the comments removed are highly irrelevant and innappropriate in regards to what the spa itself has to offer. The user who made them sounds very jealous or disgruntled and fogs the image the spa really has. the wiki should not be the place for comments of that nature. Users/Samantha

20070719 22:08:25 nbsp I can understand your point of view Samantha.  However, as a new user you should learn about the wiki first (check out Welcome to the Wiki).  This is a resource (as others have pointed out) that is completely open.  If you want to respond to commets fine, but if you continue to delete comments you will end up in a wiki war (as you have already seen, Im sure), that you will most likely regret! Users/Davidlm

20070812 15:26:36 nbsp I would appreciate it if you didnt move my comment off the ninas page. Im not sure the user has seen the page I created for him/her and leaving a comment on the business page was a good way of making sure s/he did. Users/ArlenAbraham

20071028 21:00:07 nbsp Yes, I deleted the last rampage by someone called NiftyWitch on Joe Spectors page. She has every right to write those words, but its not her page and I have every right to remove those words.   She had already written her opinion about her and really offered no new information. So I deleted the last installment of the overgrown yard as a reason to not vote for someone for School Board.   Users/SharlaDaly

20071029 16:20:17 nbsp David, Comments and postings are deleted all the time.  Otherwise it will be taken over by a purely negative element.  However, I am uninterested in doing anything to give NiftyWitch any measure of delight over conflict that she causes.  So, instead of deleting NiftyWitchs utter trash of a post, I voiced my displeasure.  Is this really better? Users/SharlaDaly

20080513 10:07:55 nbsp Sorry, for being harsh. I understand you have to do your job and cut hair, so if the customer was happy, thats whats important. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081002 11:03:34 nbsp Does http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Life_Magazine?actiondiff&version270&version169 this version put it into a better context? Users/JabberWokky

20091129 20:03:54 nbsp A lot of us (myself included) think that a persons behavior on the wiki is reflective of their behavior in real life.  I wouldnt do business with someone who behaved badly on the wiki.  So, why is it ax grinding for someone to point that out? Users/CovertProfessor

20091130 08:43:35 nbsp It didnt strike me as fishy.  The person is stating something that everyone can see, not making something up.  And Ive had that reaction myself when Im looking for new businesses.  But I dont feel that strongly about keeping the comment  its not like it adds anything to the page one way or the other (since again, its just stating something that anyone can see). Users/CovertProfessor

20100307 23:45:44 nbsp I think during the debate over the Sacto salon, I suggested we ask you if there was any reason as to why to include it.  If there was some specific service or thing they did that wasnt available in Davis, it would make sense to have it listed for people in Davis looking for that service (as they would be the nearest place).  I cant imagine anything, but there are always odd specialties that might be sought after by people in Davis that arent available locally (theres a woman in Sacramento, for instance, that specializes in weaves and hair replacement for athome hospice patients). Users/JabberWokky

20100607 21:16:47 nbsp Well said on the Strelitzia Flower Co entry.  It was a really reasonable way to put forward your concerns while taking into consideration that theres no consensus on how to handle the issue.  It was a really tactful and principled edit. Users/JabberWokky
 I agree.  Thank you. Users/CovertProfessor

20100730 20:28:27 nbsp Darn, I cant even find the article on archive.org. Thanks for the explanation. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100914 06:59:59 nbsp Thanks for adding the link to Brazilian blowout... I was wondering what that was.  I think my wife wants the opposite, having had utterly straight hair all her life.  As far as I can tell, the grass is always greener applies very strongly to hair fashion.  (And I get to dye her hair this week for the first time, having moved away from her circle of friends who used to dye each others hair) Users/JabberWokky

20100930 00:59:22 nbsp uuh, what exactly goes on in the Brazilian blowout ? Users/StevenDaubert

20101001 01:02:37 nbsp heh,that is actually along the lines of what I thought, I just imagined blowout having a blowdryer and some teasing going on. I know someone who is frizzy and curly! How much they run? Users/StevenDaubert

20101015 22:57:59 nbsp David, I think this is still evolving, but what Ive seen so far people is that people seem to be keeping price lists, as long as they dont dominate the page, and small notes about specials, again, as long as they dont dominate the page.  But large ads are definitely out.   Users/CovertProfessor

20101103 20:46:40 nbsp Neat idea with the Cobalt Salon & Gallery bold/italic! Users/JabberWokky

20101110 07:42:00 nbsp Thanks for all the great edits lately, David. Users/TomGarberson

20101110 08:25:01 nbsp I was about to say the same thing.   Users/JabberWokky

20101112 17:09:05 nbsp Hey David, were you aware that the link to your Davis Life Magazine article on the David Martin page is defunct? Users/TomGarberson

20101115 20:54:47 nbsp Thanks for making the page on Shanti Counseling!  Are they new in town, or an established business that just didnt have a page?  Also, good idea on making a Divorce page.  Where all do you think it should crosslink?  Parenting, Family Life, Legal Services, and also a general counseling page (which doesnt yet exist... currently its lumped into Medical Services).  What else would be useful? Users/TomGarberson

20101115 21:41:20 nbsp No worries!  I think that was missing from a bunch of pages in the general field. Users/TomGarberson

20101116 21:57:25 nbsp Thanks for making the page on Pete Nowlen!  Usually, People pages are the persons full name, whereas User pages are, like this one, Users/Username.  As a noteworthy person in Davis who just left a comment, Pete probably deserves both.  Pete Nowlen is the page about him, whereas Users/pnowlen is his user page.  Do you want to leave him a welcome on the user page? Users/TomGarberson

20101116 22:11:04 nbsp Oh cool!  Good deal.  Just shout if you need any help. Users/TomGarberson

20101116 22:14:55 nbsp One other thing of note: you can rename an existing page from the edit window.  Theres a button for it just beneath the editing area.  Makes it easier to transfer photos and whatnot, compared to copying everything over to a new page. Users/TomGarberson

20101116 22:19:58 nbsp Haha... builds character, right? Users/TomGarberson

20110323 08:47:37 nbsp Artists cant please everybody, and I know from experience how bad it feels to get a bad review of a creative effort intended to please people.  It looks like you have lots of people who love your work. Users/JabberWokky

20110323 23:00:10 nbsp mmmm those recent reviews look really suspect David.... Users/OliviaY

20110323 23:34:50 nbsp Hey I completely understand that.  Just make sure they dont write them so they all sound the same because it looks so fishy to people who are viewing the wiki.  (Like I would think those three were totally fake as a newcomer) Users/OliviaY

20110325 12:01:12 nbsp If you manage to introduce more editors to the wiki then you will have done a very good thing. Sorry it had to be triggered by something negative, but you responded to it in a very positive manner. Users/JasonAller

20110325 13:28:36 nbsp Just as an fyi, if an editor makes a comment or an edit on a page, like I did in the case of Brett... and it is not an informational edit or community contribution (which it wasnt)... Dont revert it. I made a statement while frustrated, removed it after thinking about ... end of story. If you want to cause drama or just piss people off, reverting their edits when they delete them out of respect for the community, go ahead and revert them.  If not, leave them alone. Yes I am in a mood today and it irritated the hell out of me to see you had done this.  Users/WesP

20110325 17:01:21 nbsp No worries David, Like I said, I was in a pissy mood this morning.. rough night as a bouncer... I need to take a Wiki Chill Pill in general for a bit. Too much drama lately, not much fun. Users/WesP

20110408 22:00:27 nbsp Sure.  I actually thought it was a bit borderline, but the person was expressing an experience and an opinion, so I thought it should stay. Users/CovertProfessor

20110409 19:12:40 nbsp That caught my eye, too.  It did occur to me to pop in for a cut to see if it happened to me... Users/CovertProfessor

20110410 16:04:25 nbsp Perhaps I will!  Thanks. Users/CovertProfessor

20110427 08:21:05 nbsp Thats either really good timing (it seems theres a bit of reassessing what is a defensible comment), or really bad timing (theres raw emotion on both sides).  Either way, it was a lousy review from either a usefulness or historical standpoint.  Not the worst Ive seen, but certainly not great. Id call it secondhand, but gossip is a good term too.  Even if it sticks around, it would be on the basis of open speech coupled with an intelligent reader will know to take it with a grain of salt.  Users/JabberWokky
  I agree that the comment was of little value and so no loss in deleting it.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110430 21:42:14 nbsp I saw the note you left on JWs page.  I have been puzzling over the two comments left in a row, one (supposedly) from Terri, saying Craft of Fo is closing, the other from Phil, saying he is Terris husband and its just moving.  So, not only do we have disagreements between former employees on the wiki, we have husband and wife disagreements.  sigh  Ive just been doing whatever I can to keep it off the wiki. Users/CovertProfessor

20110430 21:42:40 nbsp I pretty much guessed it was the tip of an iceberg made up of personal issues.  Thanks for the offer to try and calm things down.   Users/JabberWokky

20110505 16:20:56 nbsp Yup.  Ive been reluctant to say anything, since I really have no idea whats going on.  Everyones talking in such vague terms.  Even though its so vague, though, its pretty unpleasant to see. Users/TomGarberson

20110510 21:04:58 nbsp I know, I am expecting it.  Im also hoping everyone else sticks together and refuses to let the conflict spill out on the wiki. Users/CovertProfessor

20110522 20:09:14 nbsp Hey, nice cleaning up and general crosslinking today! Users/JabberWokky

20110530 16:29:58 nbsp DavidI restored a comment you deleted from All That Jazz. Please dont delete other peoples comments. Thank you. Users/PeterBoulay
  And I restored Davids deletion.  Peter, Davids been around here longer than you have, and has more perspective on this particular issue.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110530 16:32:02 nbsp By the way, was the salon originally All that Jaz or All that Jazz?  I changed it to All that Jazz, but I wasnt sure that that was right. Users/CovertProfessor

20110530 17:42:12 nbsp For what its worth, I thought the delete was fine as well. Users/JabberWokky

20110530 18:50:08 nbsp Thats ok David...Im just wondering why if it was such an embarrassing comment, that you hadnt deleted it before now? It was posted in 2007. No answer needed...just a curiosity. Have a good night Users/PeterBoulay

20110601 12:41:30 nbsp Hey David, on Beauty Salons and Barber Shops I tend to agree that having an attributed photo probably isnt the right call.  Im all for having a graphic of some kind, but as a category page it should be neutral.  If nothing else, having an attribution there would be just inviting rules lawyering next time a certain computer company owner starts fiddling with the computer repairs page.

If youre willing to have the photo there without attribution, Id be in favor of it staying.  I certainly understand if youre not, though.  I just think that its only fair to keep category pages relatively neutral. Users/TomGarberson
  What if the photo linked to Davids user page (i.e., this page, rather than the David Martin page, which is more of a page for the business)? Other photos on the wiki have attributions.  I do understand the slippery slope, worry, though.  Wed have to keep an eye on things to see how they went.   Users/CovertProfessor
    That actually seems fair to me.  I do understand that its a potential mess, but its currently only potential.  Campus Art, for example, has a captioned photo.  I think that Davids offer of the photo uncaptioned demonstrates its a freely contributed photo.  Adding an informational caption (as opposed to promotional) makes sense. Linking it here provides that info, and its David the person, which is at least one step removed from David Martin, the business.  (And this just got creepy to read if youre David... sorry about that). jw
    Works for me. tg
     Ok, I just made the change.  Thanks for being flexible and understanding about this, David.  cp

20110601 14:30:58 nbsp No problem everyone, I undestand either way.  No big emotional attachment!  :) Users/Davidlm
  Either way, thanks for uploading the image.  Its a nice iconic representation of the subject, and a pretty picture, too.   jw

20110617 19:55:38 nbsp Thanks, maybe some others will weigh in. I think its the extra glossiness and the Facebook mention that put it a bit over the edge for me. Too bad they didnt just stick with http://daviswiki.org/V.I.P._Studios_Photography?actionrecall&version66 this one, which I thought was just fine. Users/CovertProfessor

20110702 17:55:12 nbsp I know..  figured it would be fun for a second, and make a point while doing it. Users/WesP

20110703 11:41:44 nbsp Does our house do food for take out as well? Users/NikhilDahal

20110703 11:46:55 nbsp I was assuming you worked there so I thought Id ask you.
Anyways do you work there? Because I visited on June 19, and it said they are closed, but the wiki says they are open? I dont know but just trying to clarify. Users/NikhilDahal

20110703 11:54:36 nbsp Maybe you could scan a menu from Our House and upload it to the wiki? Dont know if they rotate their menu, but both my partner and I read the menu thoroughly on Friday, and didnt see anything vegetarian in the entree section. We even asked the hostess if we were missing anything veg on the menu and she said no but they can make ratatouille. If you could get your hands on a menu for all prospective customers to see, that would be great. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110703 18:41:33 nbsp There is nothing wrong for you backing up a restaurant you have friendship with. I encourage that.  Users/NikhilDahal

20110704 11:57:51 nbsp Thx for the support on The Craft of Fo Paws. Users/PeterBoulay

20110706 17:06:35 nbsp Spelling error..I know.. Users/NikhilDahal

20110708 20:19:53 nbsp I just wish I knew the color scheme of the place so I could match it.  Include(PhotoRequest,DagNabIt!) Users/JabberWokky

20110721 19:57:30 nbsp Thanks so much for grabbing the info. Only had access to a phone for most of the day and trying to actually edit pages is a lot of work on a phone. Users/hankim

20110810 11:35:02 nbsp What sort of email harassment? Users/TomGarberson
  This. 1. Get cops involved. 2. ??????? 3. PROFIT!!!! Users/hankim

20110810 19:28:38 nbsp Best not to reply. Users/CovertProfessor

20110914 20:40:10 nbsp Thanks for sharing you thoughts on the ethnicity groups... Personally I think the GLBT groups are the exception rather the rule as there is no specificity to gender or race. I am also proud of you being a gay male and not ashamed of it. It is a positive sign of growth in this country. I am not gay, myself, but have come to accept them as both people and friends since moving to California in 1996. Took me a bit longer to try to understand and accept the transgendered community, but Im working on it.  Users/WesP

20111005 19:41:04 nbsp I miss the blue phase picture!  You should put it back up somewhere.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20111006 07:37:43 nbsp Well, I dont feel about it that strongly.  I just like the picture.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20111018 20:29:31 nbsp Yeah, I figured that you didnt want to (and I respect you for not doing it), but really, there was nothing useful added there. Users/CovertProfessor

20111030 22:59:17 nbsp I dont either.  I Am Always Baffled by Those Who Think Things Sound More Impressive If They Are Capitalized. Users/CovertProfessor

20111101 20:48:32 nbsp It was.  Feel free to blush. Users/JabberWokky

20111101 20:50:05 nbsp Pretty sure it was.  When I first saw it I thought Davis Life Magazine, and given the context I was like, O.o.  Then I realized he meant you, and I was like ahhhhhhh, now it all makes sense. Users/TomGarberson

20111101 20:58:24 nbsp Definitely was. Users/CovertProfessor

20111113 23:12:46 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/WilliamLewis?actiondiff&version21137&version11136 My take also as to why there is an open discussion on an obvious thing.  Also to give a moment to come back and say something critical like, but I never worked there.  That particular example likely doesnt apply in this particular case, but there have been others where a good edit is mixed into a bad edit, only discovered with a bit of communication. Users/JabberWokky

20111201 10:26:49 nbsp Glad to help! Users/JabberWokky

20111201 10:27:06 nbsp (And make a backup!) Users/JabberWokky

20111204 00:34:56 nbsp Not to edit, but I can delete events... and you can too, as of now.  Just remember that if you delete an event, you cant undelete it.  You can, however, copy the information, correct it, and then repost the event. Users/JabberWokky

20111211 23:46:53 nbsp Are you sure?  This Philip is using a different last name elsewhere on the internet and is connected to Michelles Comfort House Cleaning.  I can certainly believe it, but I didnt see anything obvious. Users/JabberWokky

20111211 23:47:17 nbsp (Well, other than the business, which PA has done in the past). Users/JabberWokky

20111212 10:42:47 nbsp Well, Im not positive, but I was told Phils Hauling is his business. Ill see what more I can find out... Users/Davidlm

20111226 17:24:57 nbsp Yeah, I can see that.  And if he takes on other stylists, it would make sense.  It just might be weird for awhile when the person and the business are one and the same  I imagine that well be constantly updating both pages.  Or maybe its clearer which content belongs on which page than I think? Users/CovertProfessor

20111226 20:35:33 nbsp Great, thanks! Users/CovertProfessor

20120116 12:50:33 nbsp Any idea who is (in quite a slap of disrespect for the recently deceased fellow, unless its one heck of a coincidence) using ChristopherHitchens name? Users/JabberWokky

20120203 16:36:46 nbsp Hi David, Thank you for your suggestion to read the information on businesses on the wiki. I have a question though. The business that I was attempting to delete information on, is by their definition temporarily closed. I own the business that the owner rented space from. People have been by thinking that he is still in business, I assume they see the address and not the notice about nonoperation. I dont like to see people wasting their time and going out of their way.  What happens when businesss do end, do they stay on the wiki forever? To me, it seems like a confusing situation and eventually having a bunch of obsolete information on the page. Also, how did anyone know that the business had been edited? Im assuming it is because you and the Covert Professor know him? Do edits come up on one single page that everyone on the wiki knows about? I havent seen information on that, and sorry if Im being long winded, Im new to the wiki and can be electronically challenged! I really do appreciate you filling me in on appropriate wiki behavior, you were very helpful! I really dont need to be angering people, when that is not my intention. If theres another area on the wiki to explain, please just let me know that, dont need to waste your time as well! Users/carrieweinrich

20120203 22:26:40 nbsp Yeah, I know what you mean. Users/CovertProfessor

20120229 18:40:23 nbsp I know.  :(  And I have resisted bashing my head for this long.  But I really hate to see her sabotage herself in this way.  It could be such a good restaurant. Users/CovertProfessor

20120323 18:29:09 nbsp Good thing were of the same mind either way. :) Users/jsbmeb

20120527 09:15:49 nbsp Congratulations! Users/JabberWokky

20120606 15:59:52 nbsp Somehow in the mess I missed your comment.  Thanks.  I appreciated that. Users/JabberWokky

20120612 18:58:51 nbsp Oh yes, thanks. That was a weird typing mistake!  Users/CovertProfessor

20120628 11:47:47 nbsp Good revert.  And youre right.  Saying something negative is quite different than being abusive or insulting. Users/JabberWokky

20130103 16:51:59 nbsp Thx for fixing the runaway italicsI tried to but couldnt figure out where the start was kicking in. Users/PeteB

20130128 21:30:59 nbsp Im very sorry about the loss of your dog. Users/CovertProfessor

20130215 17:38:35 nbsp Huh, I didnt see that one when it came up, I guess.  That user has added zero value to the wiki and done a lot of borderline (at best) stuff.  Good deletion. Users/TomGarberson
  I toyed with deleting it when it was posted (as you can see from my edit comment on the page).  Glad to see it gone.  cp

20130220 10:28:12 nbsp I can sympathize.  Theyre never with us long enough, no matter what happens.  All we can do is enjoy and remember the days we do have. Users/CovertProfessor

20130325 21:39:45 nbsp I love the Oxford comma! It adds so much clarity and can change the meaning of a sentence.  Also, I had just logged in to comment about the ip on nutrishop when I saw that you noticed too. Great minds!  Users/LoriOrf

20130326 07:58:35 nbsp Id be careful with that wording re: profile pages, as there have been cases where people hear that and do really strange things with their profile page (either aggressive wiping of outreach, blatant promo with a nyahh, you told me you couldnt edit this, so this is mine!, or even Im starting my own wiki under Users/Me so nobody else can edit).  Im not sure what the best wording is, but certainly any outreach is better than no outreach  so dont take this as a complaint, just an observation.  Its always hard to educate somebody about the wiki when they have preconceptions and (typically) selforiented goals, be it a business or any other organization. Thanks for being the one who did it this time (and many times in the past). Users/JabberWokky

20130502 13:45:25 nbsp I think I was confused a bit there by what you meant when you said BSA.  I interpreted it to mean all members, local groups, those leaders promoting inclusiveness and pushing to change the current rules, etc.  I now think when you said BSA you meant the official national organizations stance (and horribly a common stance within at least a percentage of the BSA)?  Users/JabberWokky

20130502 17:51:39 nbsp I can be dense.  I can put my foot in my mouth.  And I believe I did so earlier today.  Reading back what I had written earlier comparing Californias Prop 8 to the BSAs rules, I realize that I should never have used you specifically in what I intended as a situational comparison.  I dont know that it felt personal to you, but it could too easily and very reasonably be taken as personal, and I should not have put your name in there.  I thank you for having too much class to point out my error and apologize for having done that. Users/JabberWokky

20130502 19:34:38 nbsp FYI I agree with you. BSA clearly discriminatesand its not If they talk about homosexuality.... its If they even suspect you are gay..... It upsets me considerably as I was a scout as a kid. Users/PeteB

20130503 09:43:32 nbsp David, I have read all of your comments on the scouting talk page and on other users pages.  I just want you to realize that my intent is not to whitewash anything.  I do want the BSA policy to change.  I am just trying to offer a glimpse of what the local units (at least the ones that I am involved with) feel about the policy.  This is a very hot and personal issue for a lot of people.  It is very difficult in this town to have an honest dialogue with people on this issue, and I appreciate that you bring your experiences to the table.  I was a little disappointed when you first removed your comment saying that you are not sure that you want to engage in this.  I think the discussion is good for the community. Im always up for a cup of coffee if you would like to either know more about the local units, or if you would just like to tell me about your experiences and thoughts on scouting, or if you just want to have coffee.
