In July 1999, a joint committee of councilmembers and staff from Davis and Dixon presented a draft resolution to form an agricultural buffer (open space) between the two cities, similar to the VacavilleDixon Greenbelt established in 1996.Footnote(Harness, Don. http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_verz39.882004&rft_idinfo:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:&rft_val_formatinfo:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat1013840F9836B38F&svc_datInfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat0D0CB57AEDE52A75 Dixon and Davis draft proposal for greenbelt. The Reporter. 19990711.) The cities would purchase development rights on the privatelyowned farmland, preventing current and future owners from developing on it, through what is known as a conservation easement. Davis would use funds raised through Measure O to fund these purchases.

Although talks between local and state organizations continued, no action was taken until 2004 when efforts to acquire the 300acre McConeghy Ranch began in ernest. UC Davis held an option to purchase the land since 2000 but decided that it no longer needed it. In September 2004, the http://www.consrv.ca.gov California Department of Conservation and http://www.usda.gov US Department of Agriculture contributed $2.9 million towards the purchase. Davis, Dixon, and UCD contributed a total of approximately $800,000. The http://www.solanolandtrust.org/ Solano Land Trust, who would be managing the greenbelt, was loaned an additional $1 million from Davis and Dixon. The purchase was finalized on December 7, 2005.Footnote(Golden, Cory. http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_verz39.882004&rft_idinfo:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:DVEB&rft_val_formatinfo:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat10E675B5C0554BF0&svc_datInfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat0D0CB57AEDE52A75 First piece set in greenbelt. The Davis Enterprise. 20051208.)

The 146acre EbeyLaughtin Ranch was the next acquisition. Davis, Dixon, and the Solano Land Trust purchased the property on July 20, 2006 for $2 million, using about $1 million in funds from the Department of Conservation, bringing the greenbelt to 446 acres. Davis contributed $810,000.Footnote(Murphy, Melissa. http://thereporter.com/news/ci_4078951 Dixon, Davis get big boost for greenbelt. The Reporter. 20060721.)

There is no set acreage goal, but there has been talk of purchasing about 1,000 acres. Possible additions include the 292acre Miles Ranch and a 593acre plot owned by the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento.Footnote(Eberling, Barry. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/07/30/news/154new2.txt Davis/Dixon greenbelt expands.

20090302 16:58:23 nbsp Although its true that I dont bike nearly as much as some Davisites (I dont even own a single piece of spandex!), the biking trip between Davis and Dixon is one of the most beautiful areas Ive ever biked through.  Just be careful if the sun is shining...its easy to get sunburned! Users/hokusman
