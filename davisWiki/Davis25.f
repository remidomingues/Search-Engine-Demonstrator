20100103 16:01:38 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Is Modern Nails part of Abba Salon and Spa? If so there may be a better way to handle the page names. Users/JasonAller

20100103 16:30:43 nbsp Yes, welcome!  Also, can you clarify the relationship between Abella Hair Design and Abba Salon and Spa?  You say that Abba is the new name for Abella, but another editor says that Abella is still in business.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100126 22:15:30 nbsp Im glad we were able to fix the page up.  Ive gone and deleted the Talk page, since we dont need it anymore. Users/CovertProfessor

20100203 21:38:07 nbsp Do you know why the prices were removed? Users/JasonAller

20100603 21:08:37 nbsp I removed the prices from the Abba Salon and Spa page, and left you a rather bright note there.  Feel free to delete the note once youve seen it.  The prices should not be listed on the page, since theyre available on the salons website.  If you wanted to write a brief description in addition to whats there (Coloring ranges from $X to $Y and waxing services fall between $A and $B, depending on the area or something like that), I doubt anyone would mind.  Please have a look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page.  If youre not clear on why the prices were removed, its because of the Wikis nonprofit status.  Theres a rather lengthy discussion over at Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions.  Look over that page, and if you still have any questions, please feel free to ask. Users/TomGarberson

20100721 15:21:07 nbsp The page needs to be written in the third person.  For example, it needs to use they instead of we.  The reason for this is that the page is written by the community, not by Abba Salon.  Users/CovertProfessor
