Hi,

Im Maggie S, Group Rep for the Davis AlAnon Family Group ACOA meetings and member of the DavisAFG service group handling outreach.

This DavisAFG signon allows us to update/modify information about meetings without breaking anonymity.  Im new at this and welcome advice or suggestions on how to improve these efforts.
Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for updating the AA meetings, thats great information to keep current.  Users/TomGarberson


There is no real need for being anonymous, especially since you are self professed group rep...

besides we frown upon Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts (the few ruined it for the many)

deactivate this, and participate with the wiki considering the importance of using your realname

20111025 09:15:01 nbsp There is a need for being anonymous; anonymity is the spiritual foundation of our program. I dont understand why this is suddenly a problem. We have a good history here.

As for not using a pseudonym: the wiki Introduction doesnt address it, the Welcome merely says that the importance cannot be underestimated, even the section stating When Use of Real Name Matters reads: “Other users who choose to use a pseudonym to remain anonymous manage to establish their credibility through making a history of providing many valuable contributions to the wiki. (For example, by creating and editing pages on a Davis related subject that the site is currently lacking. The anonymous AlphaDog did this with the Town Flora section.)…”.

If there is a new RULE, then perhaps the Intro, Welcome and Guide should all be updated to state that YOUR USERNAME WILL BE DELETED. Then dishonest people can use fake names instead.

20111025 09:16:34 nbsp that last comment sounds rude, wasnt meant to.  Just trying to make the point.  Users/DavisAFG
perhaps you didnt click Wiki Community/Organizational accounts and look at the vast discussion/happenings that predate all of this. You miss my point, you can be anonymous, your anonymous organization cant. Funny isnt it? Daubert

20111025 15:06:38 nbsp Does anyone have any objections to allowing DavisAFG to just keep using this account?  It seems like the simplest option? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Well, there was a long, drawn out discussion, and the consensus was to disallow organizational accounts.  So, someone could decide to unilaterally override that consensus, or we could reopen the discussion.  Or, I would advocate that we treat this case as we treated the others and close the account, since Ive yet to hear why it should be treated differently.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111025 16:48:50 nbsp Once again, Welcome to the Wiki!

As Daubert said, the problem here isnt anonymity; its the exceptional voice inherent in using an organizational account.  Using an individual pseudonym means youre an individual interacting with other individualssomething the Wiki has embraced as a goal.  Using an organizational account means youre ostensibly speaking to other individuals from a position of authority, speaking on behalf of something, etc.  For better or for worse, thats a model of interaction thats been rejected here.

This doesnt strike me as one of the more problematic examples, but for the sake of consistency, Id tend to agree with others here.  Your edits, Maggie, have been just fine.  The problem is what happens when someone comes along using an organizational account and starts abusing that position, pointing to this as an argument for why (s)he shouldnt have to change anything.  There have been some genuinely abusive org accounts, unfortunately.

So, by all means, feel free to use a pseudonym.  Just not an organizational one. Users/TomGarberson
