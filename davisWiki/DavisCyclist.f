Name: Davis Cyclist

Personality: Just a guy who wants to Bicycling cycle only he is tired of riding his bike cause he continunously get flat tires because assholes put their grass clippings and tree branches in the bike lanes.  I would actually like to see the city of Davis lose its Platinum title until they clean up these streets.  Thats cool that they have bike lanes but dont call them bike lanes when they are really garbage lanes.  And another thing that bugs me.  Why does the city give us a recycling container with two separate sections, one for plastic and one for glass when all they do is dump it into the same thing in the back of the recycling truck.  I think the city doesnt actually recycle.  But whatever.  Thats all I have to say.
