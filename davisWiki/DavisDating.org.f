Around April 25, 2007, signs (lawn spam) for davisdating dot org started showing up around Davis.  The page has no contact information, and only requests a bunch of personal information followed by a message saying someone will contact you. Similar signs have appeared in nearby cities including Vacaville and Natomas around the same time.

This site is ultimately managed by a company called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_One/Together_Dating Together Dating which runs an http://themetricsystem.rjmetrics.com/2008/11/06/singlelawnsignsconquertheamericanlandscape/ elaborate guerilla marketing scheme that has placed such signs throughout the country. Most reviews of their services are http://www.ripoffreport.com/searchresults.asp?q1ALL&q4&q6&q3&q2&q7&searchtype0&submit2Search!&q5Together+Dating pretty negative, though the secretive nature in which they roll out these sites makes it difficult for any but the most determined customer to discover (and thus deliver a review attributed to) the true name of the organization they have dealt with.


20070425 19:57:33 nbsp What is the legality of these signs? I presume that property owners can pull them out and dispose of them. Any idea who it was that went around sticking them in? Users/JasonAller

   I dont know about lawn signs, but I worked for a company that put up some signs on telephone poles and apparently got a call from the police saying that PG&E complained that they were vandalizing their poles and they needed to stop or face charges.  Also this was not in Davis, and I cant even say that its 100% true since I didnt take the call. Users/BradBenedict
