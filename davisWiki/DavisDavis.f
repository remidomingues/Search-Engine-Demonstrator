Welcome to the Wiki! One note i would be nice to see what you do like in Davis. Your reviews are all strong negative, and positive reviews help establish whether youre generally cranky, or if those places really do suck. Users/CraigBrozinsky

You bet Craig.  I love Sophias (bar and resaurant included) even though the food isnt the most authentic, but still very good.  Woodstocks is the best Pizza in Davis, by far...but Steves really isnt that bad either.  In terms of Sushi, I hit up Nobu fairly regularly.  Good prices, and the sushi is amazing.  Way better then Fujis.  I honestly dont know why people stand in line for so long for that place...not worth the wait.  Mexican:  nothing authentic in Davis (as a San Diego native, I have high standards when it comes to this) but guad is decent and the mahi mahi burrito at Dos is pretty good.  Users/DavisDavis

The whole Im from Southern California, I know what real Mexican food is like schpiel is a little old, and woefully inaccurate.  Considering the agricultural presence in Central and Northern California, and the thousands upon thousands of migrant workers it attracts, its a safe bet youll find Mexican food up here that is just as, and most likely more, authentic than that of Southern California.  Another misguided aspect of the irritating Southern California superiority complex. Users/CameronYoung

I was actually comparing NorCal Mexican food to actual Mexican food....from Mexico.  As San Diego is right on the border I spent a lot of time in Mexico while growing up.  Nothing in Davis (except for Guad, which is the best in Davis) comes close to what anyone in their right mind would consider authentic Mexican food.  I never said anything about NorCal as a whole, just Davis.  Nor did I ever say anything about Southern CA being superior to Nor Cal in any way.  That is just Cameron Youngs interpretation, a woefully inaccurate interpretation that obviously is deeply rooted in some sort of inferiority complex that likely stems from his (or her?  Not to be rude, its just Ive met Camerons of both sexes) wish to be from such a beautiful part of the State.  Note I did not say the most beautiful part of the state.  Norcal has its fine points as well.

Also, to say that NorCal could have likely more authentic Mexican food than that of Southern California is just idiotic.  Cameron, stop and slap yourself for that one and do everyone a favor.  Have you ever looked at a map of southern california?  Well, go look at one.  Go ahead, Ill wait.  Now, whats just south of San Diego, a mere twenty miles or so? MEXICO.  So youre saying that the authenticity of a food, relative to its native country, is a direct relationship to how far away the food is being consumed from the aforementioned country?  So if I countinued north to say, Alaska, would I find EVEN BETTER Mexican food than here?  I understand what youre saying concerning the migrant workers bringing the cuisine north with them, but the concentration is still down south.  You cant argue that.  Users/DavisDavis
                   Nativeborn Mexican immigrants dont stop in San Diego, they keep traveling up through California into many western states and now even midWestern states.  So it is very plausible to find authentic Mexican food far from San Diego made by native Mexicans.  Users/JamesSchwab

James, as with Cameron, you are both missing the point.  Sure, it is possible to find authentic Mexican food far from Mexico but the concentration is still closer to the border.  Having lived all over the country (DC, Chicago, Seattle, NYC, etc) I can assure you that it is nearly impossible to find authentic Mexican food in many areas outside of CA and other states bordering Mexico.  Note that I put nearly.  Nor did I ever say that Mexican immigrants stop in San Diego.  Once again, you cant argue against the fact that the concentration of authentic Mexican food is closer to the border. Users/DavisDavis
