The Davis Downtown Business Association publishes a comprehensive downtown directory on their website, http://davisdowntown.com DavisDowntown.com.  The directory includes listings of more than 490 downtown businesses, a map of downtown, and highlights things to do while in downtown. All downtown Davis businesses are listed in the directory by category with no additional charge to businesses. More than 40,000 of these directories are distributed annually to local hotels, downtown businesses, conferences, sporting events, apartment complexes, students, and UC Davis.

The website features images of downtown streets, doubledecker buses, and the Davis Farmers Market.  Images will be changed from time to time to highlight the variety and uniqueness of downtown Davis.

During 20052006 they had advertisements on some of the doubledecker buses bearing the slogan Escape the usual.
