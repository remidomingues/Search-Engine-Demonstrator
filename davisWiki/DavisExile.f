20060524 07:33:00 Welcome to the Wiki. Can you tell us more about your http://daviswiki.org/Cafe_Roma?actiondiff&date1148449360 statement on the Cafe Roma page?  Users/JasonAller
  Some elaboration based on things I know:  Cafe Roma is a corporation owned by Sandy Boyd who lives in San Francisco.  Its my understanding that he doesnt oversee the Cafe Romas in Davis very actively.  Some who work at Cafe Roma have told me they dont feel they get enough money for things such as maintance, so I cant imagine his ownership does much to make it not seem like a true community cafe.

20060725 18:16:00 nbsp Hey Exile, can you expand your comments on Tank house so they flow more easily though the article?  I think the tank house page is interesting, and its up to be a next featured page sometime soon.  It would be easy to make your comments flow if you expanded on the reasons why it may not be considered integral. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060725 18:29:49 nbsp Hey, I reverted your changes because they were nonunderstandable as written (you said some disagree with facts of record).  If you know those facts are wrong (especially if you have a good reference), change the fact  feel free to change the article, you dont have to just add parenthetical, nonspecific objections.  Nobody will be offended if you alter the text, especially if youre sure your changes are correct.  Your edits are http://daviswiki.org/Tank_House?actiondiff&version262&version161 here, and you can revert back to where you were by clicking revert on your version http://daviswiki.org/Tank_House?actioninfo here.  If you need help, just do your best in explaining what your objection to something is, and somebody will help you.  Users/JabberWokky
