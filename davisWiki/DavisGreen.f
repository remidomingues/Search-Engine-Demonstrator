20070910 19:39:05 nbsp It wasnt meant to hurt you politically, I just wanted to show the community that you are a liar and a hypocrite. Users/DavisGreen

20070910 19:47:20 nbsp No shit. Users/PaulHarms

20070910 19:50:28 nbsp The last few weeks have given me the impression that its not safe for me to reveal my name. Users/DavisGreen

20070910 19:51:41 nbsp Sockpuppets are bad. Users/Administrator

20070910 19:53:17 nbsp And who could Wenche have told...someone she became close with who also is interning in DC...I wonder about the portapotties and paintball tournaments on the east coast these days. Users/PaulHarms

20070910 19:54:35 nbsp ahahahahahaha Users/BrentLaabs

Lame

20070910 19:56:07 nbsp The only person I told was my then gf, wenche. It doesnt take a genius to follow the information. But write what you want on my page, thats what a public page is for. Users/JamesSchwab

20070910 19:57:49 nbsp WHOA.... James.... you are out of line....i have better things to do than to waste my time on you.  Users/WeMo

20070910 20:20:22 nbsp whats wrong with wiki:drama:Detectives eTectives?!?1five Users/StevenDaubert

20070910 20:26:22 nbsp Oh what... you dont like people calling you out when you try to defame people XSpencer Higgins HigginsXDavisGreen? Lulz. Users/WilliamLewis

20070910 20:26:47 nbsp Im on the east coast right now.  Whomever this wenche person is, Im not sure.  I have my own history with Schwab. Users/DavisGreen

20070910 22:19:25 nbsp This is like a bad comic book series where you kill off one villain, and the next episode a weirder one pops up! Users/JamesSchwab

20070911 21:36:53 nbsp HAHA dont know who you are either but i wish i knew, cuz you and i could have lots in common ;)  Users/WeMo

I will be sure to contact you over the weekend  DavisGreen

20070911 22:06:46 nbsp Mmmm... Meat Puppets. Only solution is an OMGLOLWIKIBBQ! Users/KarlMogel

I would never hang out with you.  How dare you call me that.  DavisGreen

You misunderstand me, madame or sir. The reason you bring meat to a BBQ is for marinating and grilling. :)
Oh, and might I add, you seem particularly absolute for someone who is supposedly new to thee wiki. Users/KarlMogel KJM

20070911 22:59:52 nbsp This is ridiculous.  Im not familiar with the drama here, and I cant be bothered to look it up, but if Wenche wanted to chastise James shes quite comfortable doing it publicly.

I mean, what do you think shes doing?  Connecting to some proxy server in Virginia so she can have an elaborate comment conversation with herself to disguise some edit thats now gone?

I know it might be hard to believe, but theres more than one person out there who doesnt like James. Users/ScottRitchie

20070913 22:16:29 nbsp At the risk of stirring up more wikidrama, it seems clear to me that this is a SteveO account.   Note the distinctive writing style, the lack of edit comments, the timing, the obsession over James Schwab, etc. Users/Graham.Freeman
 Im going to go out on a limb and say I dont think this is Ostrowski (and I really dont think its Wenche).  After working with Ostrowski for some time, I think statements such as It wasnt meant to hurt you politically, I just wanted to show the community that you are a liar and a hypocrite. Users/DavisGreen dont fit his rhetorical style, which has been fairly consistent since the day he popped up in ASUCD.  Id say its someone a bit more polished than SO.  PaulHarms

20071030 20:58:45 nbsp Sockpuppets used maliciously are not welcome on the Davis Wiki. Users/EdWins

20071030 21:03:58 nbsp LOL Thats great. I do smoke marijuana! Did you figure that out by the shirt I wear with a big weed leaf on it? Or my advocacy for the legalization of it? Or maybe we passed a blunt together. Do you know where I can get some good chronic?
