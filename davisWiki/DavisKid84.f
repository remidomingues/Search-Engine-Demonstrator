20080724 13:52:04 nbsp Hi there, I read your comment on Stonegate Village Apartments saying that the complex is very fair with the security deposits. What did you mean by fair? Did you mean that the amount of money asked for the security deposit is fair, or that they are fair when refunding the deposit? I ask because were moving out of our apartment soon and Ive heard some negative things in the past about charges to the security deposit when renters have pets.  Users/ElleWeber

20080808 11:17:31 nbsp Hey! How funny that its you :) Thanks for the info about the deposits; for some reason I remembered reading horrible comments about people not getting their deposits back and management accusing residents of peturinesoaked carpets and whatnot when it wasnt true, but I cant find that anymore. I may have misremembered it about a different complex. Weve moving at the end of August so Im starting to freak out about cleaning the apartment and we really want to get our whole deposit back. They already remodeled our unit, so thats not an option :) But itll probably be fine. We should get together before we leave! Our current fosters are getting pretty big, but theyre still adorable. Stop by and see them!  Users/ElleWeber

20080916 17:43:31 nbsp Were gone from Davis now, sorry we couldnt meet up before I left! But we did end up getting our whole deposit back from Stonegate, so I worried for nothing. Or maybe we were just really good at cleaning :)  Users/ElleWeber
