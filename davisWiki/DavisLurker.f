Okay, so Ill put it this way: when a lurker resurfaces, people say hi.  It was a friendly gesture, thats all. Users/JabberWokky

20080712 13:10:39 nbsp In response to your question http://daviswiki.org/Users/DavisLurker?actiondiff&version29&version18 this. It was part of fixing all the user links to that they start with Users/ and while I was at it I made a few minor changes. Users/JasonAller

20121014 22:47:45 nbsp I am curious, how does one flag or report another user?

P.S. I would hazard a guess that your comments were removed because they were irrelevant to anyone looking for information on Vini, which, after all, is what a wiki is for. Users/MeggoWaffle

20121015 08:22:21 nbsp Hey, I just removed your new comment because it doesnt really have anything to do with the subject of Vini Wine Bar.  Ill add it back if youre really upset, but honestly, It seems to me that if you post stuff like that on the entry youre kinda distracting from the actual focus of the entry: the wine bar itself.  Incidentally, thats what Talk pages are usually used for: a place for wiki and editing related discussion, so the main page isnt filled up with wikieditingrelated talk.      What was the original comment that was removed?  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20121015 10:07:23 nbsp Evan, I ws talking to Covert Professor who DELETED MY COMMENT. You had no right to come along and delete my comment. Add it back, or Im reporting you. Users/DavisLurker



## I dont think Davis lurker quite understands how the wiki works... Im still trying my best to not spew vitriol at our quasi anonymous friend here



20121016 10:15:45 nbsp I think Evan is trying to illustrate a point: raging, deleting stuff, and shutting down all dialog is counterproductive. Users/TomGarberson

20121016 10:25:12 nbsp Could you please stop playing angry games on the wiki?  There is a limit to the tolerance of this negative and antagonistic editing.  Were all here to document and celebrate Davis, and while there can be a large amount of silliness and fun had during that process (just like any other healthy group of people), it ideally stays positive, and communication is always important.  It might be worth noting that this entry is not yours any more than any other; just as the entry under my account is not mine... they are merely ours by mutual respect.  I certainly have edited other peoples profiles and had mine edited by many people. I deleted my comments off this entry (plus one by an editor for whom I have agreed to manage his old comments) because you are ignoring them, dont seem to understand the purpose of user profiles and communication via comments, and I feel Megans question and statement is the most positive and helpful toward moving in a direction where we address the original issues and can start to all work together. Users/JabberWokky

20121016 10:34:10 nbsp JW, you are not welcome on my page. I dont want your comments on my page, and I dont want to engage you.  Thats my right and privilege. Your continuing to come, editing, and spewing, is getting ridiculous, and mentally questionable. GO AWAY AND GET A JOB.  The discussion is over. Users/DavisLurker

20121016 10:40:58 nbsp So, Im going to ask it again: what are you trying to accomplish with all this? Users/TomGarberson
