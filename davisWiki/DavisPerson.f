You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the great Pit Bulls entry!  I changed the layout a bit, and also moved the link to it on the Dogs page to the Davis Dog Community section.  Great first contribution, and again, Welcome to the Wiki!   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
