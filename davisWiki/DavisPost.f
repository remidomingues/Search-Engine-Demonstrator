DavisPost (davispost.org) is a free classified ads website created solely for the Davisites residents and students of Davis. The user base is slowly growing larger and the posts are moderated to remove spammers and outside posters which is a nice feature. Many of the top ads are reposted on the DavisPost Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/DavisPost). The site was previously called www.davispost.tk but was changed to www.davispost.org on July 19th, 2012. The advantage of DavisPost over Craigslist is that listings are solely from the Davis area and are announced on facebook for better exposure.

The listing categories for the site are:

 Housing/Apartments
 Automobiles
 Bicycles/Alt.Transportation
 Textbooks
 For Sale
 Services
 Business Listings
 Jobs/Employment
 Gigs
 Events
 Travel
 Misc
