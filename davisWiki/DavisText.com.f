DavisText.com was a locally owned websites locally oriented website created by UC Davis students to serve the Davis community by helping members save money on textbooks.  More recently, however, it became part of a national network called Koofers, offering more or less the same services.

The site serves as a textbook price comparison engine by comparing prices from theUCD Bookstore against over 20 online retailers including Amazon.com, Half.com, and Chegg.com to help students save money on rising textbook prices.

In 2010 the company reincorporated under the name Textbo to expand its platform to over 50 university campuses nationwide. In 2011 a white label platform was launched to help nonprofit organizations and student organizations clubs on campus to help fundraise and give back to the community.

Textbo was acquired in 2011 by Koofers.com
