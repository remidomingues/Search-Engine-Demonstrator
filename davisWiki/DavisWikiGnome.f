Why was removing the chatter on the Davis Psychic page controversial?  Go fer it  its part of the Wiki process.

What exactly on the Flies page was controversial?

20060120 21:24:03 nbsp Im not in favor of this account, not because of the usage, but because there is no way to know how many different people are using it. Users/JasonAller

20060120 21:28:05 nbsp Yeah this account seems like a really really bad idea to me.  If there is something you feel is too contentious for you to touch it, get someone like Phil with godlike amounts of wiki respect to smite it down, dont hide behind what is essentially a community troll. Users/KrisFricke

20060121 15:03:28 nbsp ::abusively gives naysayers the bird:: Users/DavisWikiGnome

20060203 19:52:04 nbsp Edits like http://daviswiki.org/Redrum_Burger?actiondiff&date21139019572&date11138685444 this are not necessary, positive contributions. I dont know how many people have been using this account, but these three edits should either have been stood behind by their author or not made. Users/JasonAller
  Gotta agree with you there. Those comments arent controversial, theyre just abuse. (And obviously from the same author.) I personally think they should simply be deleted. (Whether it means the account should be deleted is a different question.  Any tool can be abused.) Users/JeffreyNonken
  Theyre obviously from the same author at the same time and place, but I dont think theyre abuse. Theyre anonymous likely to prevent retribution. Thats one of the purposes of this account. To allow whistleblowers to share information which could get them in trouble, but is nonetheless true. They do not even sound antiRedrum. Privacy has value, and is an endangered species in todays world. I say keep the comments, and definitely keep this account. (Personally I would have named this account Anonymous though) Users/SteveDavison

20060308 12:41:32 nbsp If you feel like anonymously removing something from a page, please at least give a reason for the removal. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20060318 16:50:36 nbsp Given that this page says If it is abused, it will be deleted promptly. How is one to react to http://daviswiki.org/MatthewKeys?actiondiff&date1142716706 this edit? Users/JasonAller

20060404 08:48:54 nbsp I like this concept  its certainly no worse than your typical anonymous account. Users/DavisWikiGnome

20060404 14:32:47 nbsp I must say, at first I was quite against this, but the gnomes saucy antics have been growing on me.  What is this greasemonkey script Arlen mentions? Users/KrisFricke

20060412 09:23:58 nbsp Ok, now that this account has been around for a while.... is it really a good idea? Ive only once seen it used for a good purpose, and seen it repeatedly used for bad purposes. Is it time to trash the gnome? Users/EricKlein
  Its my personal belief that the gnome should stay.  Id rather have one account abused by many than everyone creating individual accounts for abuse.  Ability to log who used the gnome when is about the same as who used clone accounts.  All the information is Recent Changes there you just have to know how to use it.  Users/DavidReid David Clone Hunter Reid

Its reasonable to assume that the account is being used by a single individual now, unless the password is changed back (and its not too hard to guess who is using it).  Of course, passwordbackandforth can be expected in a situation like this where you make such information available.

20060512 21:10:44 nbsp I vote that the wiki gnome be either delted or just changed to MatthewKeys, for better identifacation purposes.  Just a suggestion. Users/AndrewBanta

20060512 21:41:16 nbsp I had a thought, how about the gnome password be secret, and users can email for the password, and than use it, and the password is changed yet again.  Perhaps using random numberletter combinations. Users/DavisWikiGnome

20060512 23:21:25 nbsp i think the wiki gnome was a good idea, but now we should all just be honest and say whatever, most cases its easy to figure out who was using the gnome account at the time of the edit anyways. ive never used or had a use for it. if you think someone was rude, tell them, they might have been misread. throw ideas around, if no one likes them, well find a way. remember apollo? i kinda miss the guy. his/her first edits were pretty cras (sp?) but by the time we all argued over it, the edits were pretty great. i say no use for the gnome account, esp since its only being used by one person and creating many reverts, editing time that could have been spent elsewhere...
