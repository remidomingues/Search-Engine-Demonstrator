Id like to put forth the idea of a DavisWiki Press Passes. The general idea being that they are totally symbolic, but that sometimes in this world a little bit of symbolism goes further than common sense. We are after all a collective press; and weve struggled with censorship both corporate and community.

Im picturing a traditional style press pass where any Dwikian (Thanks for the term Users/PopeChristof) could come to this page, add their name, download the pass, add their picture, print it out, and optionally even go to the lengths of getting it laminated. Buying a brimed hat to stick it in and an old style camera are of course optional.


20050722 15:57:31 nbsp Good idea.  Im working on something now (but I encourage other designs too). Users/BrentLaabs

20050722 16:00:21 nbsp Im so confused.  What is it for?  Is the idea that you would present it to try to get special access? Users/MikeIvanov

20050722 16:19:36 nbsp I think its just something to make us all feel special. Users/BrentLaabs

20050722 16:22:18 nbsp I think Wiki Shirts these are best for that :)  Users/MikeIvanov

20050722 16:35:20 nbsp The suggestion was a reaction to the way one of the Daviswiki photographers was treated recently at a business. Users/JasonAller

20050722 16:49:19 nbsp You should tell us the story. Users/MikeIvanov

20050722 17:05:06 nbsp Heres what Ive come up with using the crappy computer at work.  Its stored as an attachment to this page, and it shouldnt really have a .jpg suffix.  Considering my web space is down due to catastrophic power failure, Im doing the best I can.  I have a meeting now, so take a look and feel free to suggest/make improvements in the time Im gone. Users/BrentLaabs

20050722 17:12:12 nbsp The story isnt mine, but it is at the bottom of this Nugget page. Users/JasonAller

20050722 17:28:21 nbsp I am neutral about the press pass idea, but in the case of the Nugget incident, it seems like having a wiki press pass could possibly have made things worse. Users/MikeIvanov

20050722 21:00:33 nbsp Ok, after further consideration maybe just having a stack of Wiki Flyer wikicards in the old camera bag is better. As with the press pass the trick to using the wikicards is to know WHEN to use them and when not to. Users/JasonAller

20070209 21:49:14 nbsp Unfourtantly you cant just make a press pass. You have to be approved by a legit buisness and then refered to the police department. They run a full background check and then issue (or give permission) to issue a pass in your name. This is mostly because a press pass can give someone access to crime scenes. Users/JohnNash
  Not quite true. You can print up all the press passes you like without consequence. The only downside to the press pass not being issued or endorsed by a LEA is the whole crime scene thing you mentioned. Private entities remain free to accept or reject passes issued by other private entities. This is the situation at commercial sporting events.  Users/WilliamLewis

20070210 06:32:35 nbsp Keep in mind that Davis Wiki is a legitimate nonprofit corporation.  This may be something the board has to actually approve, as it invokes the organization itself, but then, thats why there is a board... for the oddball cases like this where you actually need an legit buisness(sic).

20070210 10:10:01 nbsp If I ever see anyone with a Wiki Press Pass Im going to fucking stab them. Users/JoshFernandez

20070210 11:54:31 nbsp Personally, Id like to see JasonAller with a Press Pass.  His coverage of the plaques is great... can you image his coverage if he was granted access to closed door meetings and crime scenes? Users/JabberWokky

20080412 22:25:36 nbsp Ah finally, Ive been looking forward to a good neck stabbing. Nows my chance to start shankin.  Users/JoshFernandez
