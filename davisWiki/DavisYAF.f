Secondly, a 20,000 word history of your organization and its goals is not relevant to Daviswikis mission.  It has nothing to do with your politics or anything else.  Daviswiki is primarily about Davisspecific information. Oh, and thirdly, its not your page. Authorship does not confer any special privileges.  The page is a community resouce, subject to community editing.  Covert is wellfamiliar with Daviswikis mission and his edit will eventually stand. Users/JimStewart

20120420 08:10:34 nbsp Having a history of 20,000 word history of YAF in Davis would be great, however, as thats not available elsewhere and it helps document our town.  Thats kind of the goal: this is a Davis focused reference.  Its also CCBy, which means you cant use content directly from Wikipedia, as that is under a more restrictive license.
