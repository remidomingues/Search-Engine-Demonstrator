Sponsored and organized by the Davis Bike Club, the http://www.davisbikeclub.org/Ultra/DBC1224hr.htm Davis 12/24 Hour Challenge is an ultracycling longdistance bicycling event. Starting and ending in downtown Winters, it consists of a single traversal of a 162.5 mile portion of the Davis Double Century course (referred to as the day loop), follow by repeated traversals of a 18.4 mile course (referred to as the night loop although it is typically reached and started on in daylight). The Challenge offers two events, a 12 hour version and a 24 hour version where participants bicycle as far as they can along the course in this alloted time.
