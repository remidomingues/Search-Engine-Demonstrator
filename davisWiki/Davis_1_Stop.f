20110207 19:25:47 nbsp Got my car washed here this afternoon. I liked the idea of a touchless car wash that uses only soap and highpressured water with no brushes, carpet strips, chamois curtains, or dangling cloth, etc. touching the car, therefore avoiding scratches and damage to the paint.

However, the $8 basic wash that I got didnt clean my car so well and my car wasnt even really dirty to begin with. It just had a few spots of bird poop that didnt come off, nor did the bugs stuck on the windshield and front fender. I ended up washing the car again at home and probably wont be taking my car for a wash there again unless I do a prewash first.  Users/pvo

20111019 04:39:30 nbsp A sign posted at the entrance offered a 79 cent cup of coffee with a fillup 8 gallons or more. So I fill up my cars tank with 14 gallons of gas and go back to get my cup of coffee. Guess what? I get charged $1.80 for the coffee. So I tell the cashier about the sign in the window and he tells me that I have to ask for the discount first before buying the coffee. He does NOT offer to refund me the difference! Unbelievable. Also, their restroom was beyond filthy, was out of toilet paper, and the door was broken and didnt close completely, allowing other customers to walk in. Users/MarkWChang
