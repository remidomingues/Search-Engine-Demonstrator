This longwindedly named, DMVaccredited driving school offers drivers education and drivers training for many of Davis teenagers and also adult students.    This business casts a wide net, functioning under different names in Davis, Woodland, Dixon, Vacaville, West Sacramento, and even Adventures Outside of Davis out to Stockton.

The Mustang convertibles that the owner uses on behindthewheel training makes this company a favorite among high schoolers, not to mention DADS students high pass rate.

It was previously located at 520 2nd Street.


It should be noted that multiple false positive comments have been posted throughout this page from the same IP address. There is suspicion one of the owners is responsible for the false entries.

20070929 20:29:18 nbsp I wish my son would of had a better experience with his driving training.  We switched to T.J.s and had an excellent experience.

20080417 16:52:16 nbsp Ive gone to Davis Academy Driving School for behindthewheel training and theyre professional and friendly. Id recommend.

In reference to the post that mentions TJs driving school, it should be noted that the coowner has been accused of molesting one of his students. No word yet on whether or not hes guilty, and TJs is still open for business.

20080627 20:25:00 nbsp Ive been doing TJs since January and was supposed to schedule my second drivers training appointment for July 3rd. My dad tried all of their numbers and theyre all disconnected. The websites are still up, but I think that TJs is pretty much dead now. So because of this, I have to go through the hassle of finding a NEW school that will train me for the next two appointments. Thats alright, though; the woman whom which I was driving was a complete...you know. Users/HannahFolkes

20090828 14:51:37 nbsp I agree, Ive tried all the driving school #s and TJs is out. The only ones I could get a hold of were Davis Academy and All Stars. Academy is much cheaper than All Stars for me and my age, though both seemed very nice on the phone. Academy quoted me $270 for 6hr. and All stars said b/c I am an adult its a higher rate of $400 for 6hr.s I think Ill go with Academy. :) Users/Ilovetacos

20100506 12:49:04 nbsp If you are always home and ready to be picked up half an hour early, an hour late, or not at all, this is the driving school for you! If that doesnt work, you can get another appointment three weeks or more later and see if they show up then! Users/MUSECYCLE

20100529 12:23:50 nbsp They have good driving teachers, I was trained well. Monica is more laid back and patient while you learn, but Salvadore is a little aggressive and leaves little room for error. I recommend requesting Monica for the first and third lessons (she likes to do a mock test), and Salvadore for the second. Users/scrizer

20100607 00:36:18 nbsp I was suppose to take my three lessons with this school, ended up taking two lessons because my permit was expiring soon. I told them about my problem and they wouldnt try and squeeze me in their schedule for my third lesson a few days sooner. I transferred to ACME, and they were VERY accommodating. With the davis driving instructors i felt tense, but with ACME it was very FRIENDLY. The driver even bought me a large soda!! in the end this driving school may be one of the few in davis, but not the best at all. Users/melamazing

20110728 15:24:05 nbsp If the instructors turn up, theyre probably adequate teachers. Its the turning up part thats hard for them. Class #1: 90 mins late. Class #2: amazingly on time. Class #3: No showed for an am class. The school rescheduled for a class later that same day when we called about the noshow, and then that second instructor called, 15 mins AFTER that class was due to start, to reschedule for the NEXT day. That day, we spent a total of four and a half hours waiting for noshow instructors. If you value your time at all, go with a different driving school. Users/AmandaCorocoran

20111109 14:49:33 nbsp Hey I looked up T.J. driving school it is close, wasnt a good school after all.if you find out why it close, Davis Academy has its problems like running late trying to make every one happy,as we know it isnt easy to drive now a days. One thing i can say they are very professional and they were able to get me to drive since i was so scared because other school took me to the freeway and i didnt know how to drive but Davis academy treat me so good and had so much patience with me they even took me to DMV to past my test.i want to Thank Leticia and Monica for being there for me.cant wait to go back and drive in New York this I owe to Leticia she was the best.  Users/lindawoods

20111228 02:41:28 nbsp This is the worst driving school in all of california. the drivers are always late or never show up and when you call the office no one ever picks up or if they do they just lie to your face and say the driver is on the way when there is no one to come pick up your child. the driver was an hr late for the first lesson and yelled at my son most of the time so he didnt learn anything. Also the driver asked my son for $20 for gas for his lesson bc if he didnt pay for gas then he wouldnt be able to drive. What kind of school is this?? i scheduled the second lesson and they did a no call no show and when i finally got through to the office, they claimed that i never called to schedule then when i spoke to leticia she claims that they made a clerical error so my sons lesson had been scheduled for the wrong day. which lie is it?! i rescheduled that second lesson and they picked my son up and had him drive to jack in the box across from their office and then the driver got sick so that was the end of that lesson. I called to get a refund and thats when they started dodging my calls and constantly hanging up. Eventually i had to file a police report and complain to the BBB to get a refund from these scam artists. Dont even bother with this company bc they are obviously terrible at doing business.

20120516 19:56:11 nbsp I was reluctant to use the services of this provider due to the bad reviews here, but went ahead and registered my son for the teens program. I have no regrets. The instructors were on time, they were very helpful and gave my son the information he needed to pass the test first time. I recommend it. Users/AChaves

20120622 13:33:22 nbsp @ iamlisa

20120920 17:56:02 nbsp Wow!! these comments are hell of old and also looks like this is a cut throat business as if some of the comments are coming from  their competetors, well i went ahead and booked my daughter and she is happy first lesson she learn to stay in her lane and she learn how to hand over hand she now is making good turns. stopping behind the cross walk looking left right left they do teach like the teen parent hand book and more i would say they have lots of good ideas if you dont have one pick one up at DMV, I thank them for their patience and their good teaching skills oh and they were on time.also they do call back i had no problem, oh yes for the competetors out there just do your job and leave others alone shame on you. once again Thank you Davis Academy my heart goes out to you, for everyone else keep your Dollars in your city.Keep in mind Davis Academy is in Davis, By,Art       Users/Arturovergara

20120920 19:46:27 nbsp Davis Academy is proud to say we have a high passing rate both drivers education online and behind the wheel. Users/Arturovergara

GUESS WHAT I PASSED! So Ive recommended family, friends and anyone interested. They made it very easy to understand, and made me feel very comfortable,

20130204 14:09:49 nbsp   I was reluctant to use the services of this provider due to the bad reviews here, but went ahead and registered my son for the teens program. I have no regrets. The instructors were on time, they were very helpful and gave my son the information he needed to pass the test first time. I recommend it, a little advise dont wait for your permit to expire book and be responsible its easy to blame someone else.of course the school is booked two weeks in advance ,Its a good school, they are not going to stop to buy you a soda to win you over, wast your time, also there wasnt any police report!! so were is this all coming from ,Davis Academy is in Davis the only school in Davis yes they have problems, I assume cars may go down and employee may get sick once in awhile.I never had a problem when I called because i called them from 1:PM to 7:pm  best time to call, even the owner is there at times.I also know the driving school has a high passing rate, You may be asking your self why am i saying all this will I think competitors have something to do with the bad reviews, 1. no air conditioning in November! know one needs air in November.so who cares 2.always late and they live in Davis 3. Asking for gas money, they can call the owner which also lives in Davis, Lets keep in mind this company pays taxs in the city of Davis, look it up am not lying, People its time we work with our small Business in Davis.Keep your Dollars in Davis. Keep in mind other schools do want them out: as its says below, looks like this is a cut throat business.Davis Academy Thumbs up!! Users/LindaCampos

20130205 15:35:15 nbsp Anyone know why they are talking about TJ driving school on Davis Academy driving School web page, as you know there is no relationship They were Davis Academy driving School competitors who give them a bad time and did their best to give them a bad name.Lets think who is still here,  with a high pasting rate, would be nice for people to remember the good things and not just the bad. oh by the way Salvador isnt working there anymore this says a lot about the owner she takes action.as soon as there is a complaint the school has been in Business since 1996 they are doing some thing right. keep in mind Packages are not refundable you dont have to buy a package, buy a 2 hour lesson  no need to buy the package,since its non refundable.go to drivingacademyonline see for yourself.it all there. keep up the good work Davis Academy Instructors!!

 Maybe so but if you have some time, its definitely worth exploring the website. Great stock photos and some very confusing sentences. My favorite parts are Its time to ride the car, we have some premises to refund, and the rotating testimonial.   Mikey
20130826 13:20:33 nbsp Davis Academy Driving School was able to fit us in, when AllStars was shortstaffed and scheduling five weeks out. The lesson went well and I appreciated their customer service. Users/CarinLoy
