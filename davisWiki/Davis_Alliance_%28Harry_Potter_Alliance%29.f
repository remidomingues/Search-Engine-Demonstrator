The Davis Alliance is a student organizations local chapter of the national 501c3 nonprofit organizations nonprofit, http://thehpalliance.org/ The Harry Potter Alliance (HPA). We have been inspired by Harry Potter to fight the Dark Arts in the real world, and work for human rights, equality, and a better world. We work hard to create a positive, fun, empowering and magical environment for all of our members and everyone we meet, and believe that fighting for what is right can also be ridiculously fun!

Even if you cannot make the meetings, you can still be an active member of the club, or even a casual observer! To follow the clubs activities, you can join the https://orgsync.com/54926/chapter orgsync or http://www.facebook.com/groups/thehpallianceucdavis/ Facebook, or ask to be put on the group email listserv! As a general rule, the Facebook group is much more active, and much more social. We also will post condensed information on our https://twitter.com/davisalliance Enchanted Twittering Galleons. Additionally, you can follow the http://thehpalliance.org/ National Harry Potter Alliance, which has a very strong online presence.

Information

Meetings

Meetings are once a week for one hour in Olson 217. The general meeting features general project announcements, a discussion question to begin a dialogue based on current events or issues presented in the books, usually resulting in a combination of both. The members are very casual and everyone is encouraged to voice their opinion or personal experience.

Depending on our current project, during meetings we will organize events, watch informational videos, create http://youtu.be/EEFHM77kNA arts and crafts, or eat http://thehpalliance.org/action/campaigns/deathlyhallows/horcrux1/ fair trade chocolate.

The Room of Requirement once had a history of shifting around to accommodate membership, but seems to have settled down in Olson 217.

Membership

The Davis Alliance accepts everyone! We are predominantly composed of UC Davis undergraduates, but graduate students and Davisites community members who are interested are encouraged to check us out, as our meetings are considered to be open to the public. You dont even have to be a huge Harry Potter nerd! (Though it certainly helps.) Members are free to choose their own houses, and we do have house competitions.

Paying dues ($3) places you on the official house list, which enables you to earn House Points when participating in club activities! At the end of the year, we award prizes to the victorious house. This nominal fee helps to pay for club fees and extra money will go to one of our charity projects. Currently, extra fees feed into the club http://www.kiva.org/ kiva, which will be started soon.

Projects

The projects undertaken by the Davis Alliance are a mix of projects spearheaded by the national HPA and ideas that our members came up with! We try to make a difference on both a local and global scale, and are open to new ideas, so please speak up if you have an idea!

History

The national organization was founded in 2005 by Andrew Slack and Paul DeGeorge (from the Famous Wizard Rock band, http://harryandthepotters.com/ Harry and the Potters). Since then, it has grown and the members have campaigned against social injustice in all its forms, from the crisis in Darfur to helping Haiti heal.

The Davis Alliance was formed in January 2011. We have already grown quite a bit, and hope to grow even more, and hope to continue making a difference! Every year we look for new exciting activities to help others.

Are you guys serious?

That is to say, yes.

Do the portraits really move?
But of course. They might need a bit of coercion, though. They like to pretend that they are normal muggle photographs, but we all know better than that.
