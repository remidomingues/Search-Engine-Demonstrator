SubClubs

Darker Than DAC
Are regular DAC shows a little too tame for you? Join Darker Than DAC! This sub club is the place to go if you want anime that is of good quality, but lacking in mainstream appeal or containing controversial content.  If you are looking for anime that is a little darker, a little edgier, and a little more questionable than what we show in club, this is the sub club for you!

DAC Gaming
If you enjoy trading card games, board games, or tabletop RPGS this is the subclub for you! Whether you are new, an amateur, or a veteran player, come and play games with us. You can look forward to monthly Booster Drafts, Board Game Nights and occasional Table Top RPG campaigns. There will be weekly TCG gaming times on campus.

DACosplay Team
If you are looking to unleash your creative side, this is the subclub for you. Come create, perfect, inspire, and assist anyone in the subclub with an interest in sewing, crafting, and designing costumes, props, and other cosplay articles. Look forward to tutorials on prop building, hand sewing, and the best tips for easy cosplay construction, as well as free time to work on your own projects with friends!

Art Team
If you like to draw, sketch, ink, or paint, this is a great place to come and learn some new techniques! Come, relax, forget your homework woes, and create for a little bit. Perfect for beginning art aficionados and pros alike. You can look forward to art swaps, competitions, and more!
