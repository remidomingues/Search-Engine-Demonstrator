The Davis Apartheid is a phrase used by a few to denote what they feel is: the fact that this town is half college students and yet college students do not get any representation on the City Council and the Davis Police Department police specifically try to infringe on the social lives of college students. The movement encourages people to Boycott Davis due to the towns intolerance of University students. The intolerance is portrayed in the citys attitude toward expanding housing for students and its http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/councilpackets/20040727/04M_Large_Party_Response.pdf noparty policy while not providing an outlet for students to do anything on the weekend. One theory is that if students do not spend money in Davis, and maybe even go as far as to tell friends that still attend high school in their home town to not apply to UC Davis because of the towns attitude toward students, then the city would inevitably feel an economic burden and realize its dependency on the student population and therefore begin to respect them as citizens of the community.

  If you feel that Davis city government is not representing your interests (and you live in Davis proper), one of the most important things you can do about it is register to vote (and actually vote) in Davis.  City government officials have no reason to give substantial consideration to the interests of students as a class unless students comprise a substantial portion of their voting consituency.  Even if you dont think increased civic participation on the part of students will have immediate effects, do your part for future generations of students.  That cop who addressed you with such unprovoked contempt may consider behaving differently to students in the future if students as a class begin to hold some influence with the citys political leadership, and the only way that will happen is if large numbers of students start voting in Davis elections.

Summary: Ex officio student council member is unnecessary. If students really wanted to be represented, theyd register to vote and run for office.

20041220 14:08:17 nbsp Overall, I think Davis is a well run city. However, I feel the residents have a certain grudge against the university and its students (while loving it at the same time). Many permanent residents are unsensitive to the needs of additional student housing, university growth, and more student nightime activities downtown.  Users/JamesDawe

20041220 14:32:42 nbsp How about organized efforts to get students informed about city issues and likewise get residents informed of student issues?  Also, I think there needs to be clairity as to what exactly the issues are.  Is a major issue the lack of a accessible, cheap venue  along with noise violations?  What is a possible solution to this?  I know that many on the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate (especially those in the Student Focus slate) promised to help establish such a venue  but it fell through.  Also, I see from Arlens article that there were proposed meetings between two executive ASUCD officials and two councilmembers, but what ever happened with these?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041221 20:53:14 nbsp Bev, one example is the Davis Governance Task Force, which the council created to study the issue of representation in Davis government.  3 students applied for the 9 spots (plus one alternate).  There were 20 applicants.  There was a student check mark on the application.  No students were picked.  In fact, out of the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/council/m092104.pdf 49 votes cast by the 5 councilmembers, only 2 were cast for students.  Moreover, applications were solicited over the summer.  Users/ChrisJerdonek

20041221 21:25:35 nbsp Apartheid seems like such a poor choice to words to describe the lack of student representation here in Davis. For the most part, as has already been pointed out, if the students cared enough, they could fix things, unlike in the South Africa of the past. It doesnt help anything to call it Apartheid, it only turns possible alies and friends into adversaries.  Users/EricKlein

This would be a good suggestion to bring up to the http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/meetings/agenda.cfm?c27 Davis Governance Task Force.  This is exactly the sort of thing theyre looking at.

They immediately tell everyone to freeze and not leave, and give breath tests/ID everyone there, handing out tons of Minor In Possession tickets ($250 a pop).

20050223 15:30:13 nbsp It really isnt difficult to make your voice heard in this town where everybody has an opinion. All you have to do is show up at the Davis City Council meetings, held regularly beginning at 6:30pm on Tuesdays, except on the fifth Tuesday of any month and Tuesdays prior to a holiday. Even crazies get to speak at council meetings, so those who complain about lack of a voice really have nobody to blame but themselves. Users/AlphaDog

20050405  11:44 nbsp This is something that has been discussed since the University opened. This will never happen, due to the Universitys reluctance to start paying taxes to the city.  The University does not pay the addition sales tax voted for by Davis city residents, or any property taxes to the city.  If the student dorms were included, then all the obligations would have to be included along with the privileges. Also, the University would have to reliquish the power to plan and develop at will.  You are not, in reality a citizen of Davis, rather a citizen of Yolo County, and only that if youve changed your registration to reflect your present living location. I find that most undergraduate students remain citizens of the city where their parents live. Sharla Daly

Was Jim Hyde trying to make a funny joke in that http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/councilpackets/20040727/04M_Large_Party_Response.pdf long pdf about parties? On the first page it mentions noteworthy parties at University Village 625 Cantrill Drive as well as 2121 Cowell Blvd. According to the google local, thats the http://maps.google.com/maps?fq&hlen&sll38.541922,121.724267&sspn0.014299,0.036736&q2121+COWELL&ieUTF8&om1 south davis safeway.

    Youll also notice that on page 14 that it states, you’ve earned the right to bust loose for an endofsemester bash. So this means that only people in professional schools at UCD have earned the right to bust loose because the rest of us are on the quarter system.

20060721 10:05:11 nbsp Didnt look like a joke to me, but it didnt look like apartheid.  (Maybe the party at 2121 Cowell was not confined to a single address, but was in the vicinity of 2121 Cowell.) Users/DukeMcAdow

20060721 10:10:20 nbsp Hahahaha!!!! You people actually think that living in Davis is comparable to apartheid??  hahahaha!!  Oh my God, Im actually laughing over here. Users/CameronMenezes

20060721 10:59:11 nbsp Cameron, admittedly I made this page, way back in 2004, out of some sort of jest. But with the town being 33% college student  not including those living on campus, who cannot vote in Davis because they technically do not live in Davis although if you ask them where they live they say Davis so that kind of is a mild form of apartheid  there is disproportionate student representation on the council. Now with Lamar on the council (and Sue, who, believe it or not, is actually the second most prostudent council member after Lamar), things will hopefully change. But in plurality elections, the majority is allowed to be ignored because the minority (in this case developer friendly council people that take make from property companies and then tell the students they are on their side, and ask for Lamargate ASUCDs illegal endorsement, but you cannot be protenant while you are in the landlords pocket) has a majority on the council. But here I go hinting at how Davis should have Choice Voting choice voting  even though some people consider that http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2005/03/15/Opinion/Letters.To.The.Editor1319954.shtml a disease. Im sure the National Party of South Africa would have also agreed that choice voting is a disease. Users/RobRoy

Rob, Davis may fulfill some of the same criterion for apartheid as South Africa did, but to me the word apartheid evokes a very horrible image, one not at all comparable to the City of Davis.  ps thanks for the link.CameronMenezes

20060731 10:32:50 nbsp While I agree that the rental climate in Davis is certainly not studentfriendly (though the same might be argued for the rental climate in all of California), I have a number of problems with the equation of student rights and partying.  First, it assumes that partying is so central to students nature, so integral to their very being, that it achieves the status of a political right.  While this notion did help to launch the Beastie Boys career, in the realm of serious civic discourse, it trivializes student voices, and may ultimately undermine the credibility of those who do advocate for more legitimate student political aimsyou know, like affordable housing, affordable tuition, etc. Second, it also ignores the fact that most students arent habitually involved in the kinds of parties that get busted by the cops.  Plenty of studenttypepeople have parties that dont wake their neighbors; plenty apply for noise permits when they plan to have a band; plenty police their own parties to make sure that attendees dont get out of hand.  Second, it fails to recognize that police respond to parties only when theyve been called by a residenti.e. when the effects of the party (noise, property damage, etc.) infringe on the rights of others. While Im sure that there may be one or two cranks in Davis who call the police out of spite, if you bothered to ask residents why they call the police, theyll most often tell you that theyve been woken up by noise.  Finallyand this is what rankles many Davis residentsthe logic of the party manifesto seems to hinge on a sense of nearabsolute narcissism.  Advocates of this partyingaspolitics position seem to be saying (though they would never explicitly claim) because we (or, more accurately in many cases, our parents) put some money into the community, and because some of that money may trickle down to you in the form of benefits from sales taxes, etc., we should be free from the restrictions of normal civil behavior.  We should be allowed to wake you up in the middle of the night, verbally abuse you, damage your property, vomit on your sidewalks, and piss on your lawns.  And if you take steps to preserve your own rights, well accuse you of an act equivalent to one of the most egregious human rights abuses the modern world has witnessed.  As the old folks say, grow up.Users/DavisExile
