The hotel was on the northeast corner of 2nd Street 2nd and G Street, and the mural could be seen from the ACE Hardware Davis Lumber parking lot.  The mural was destroyed in 2000.

For more information on the hotel and the mural, see John Loflands Demolishing a Historic Hotel: A Sociology of Preservation Failures in Davis, California.

20050111 18:20:25 nbsp Yep, its gone. So much for Davis commitment to public art. Terry Buckendorf did this mural, as well as another one depicting SFs Columbus Cafe mural Columbus Cafe that is on the west side of the building housing Carousel Stationery and Gifts Inc Carousel Stationery.

20050219 11:42:35 nbsp Where were the arches located?   Users/KayRide

20050219 11:59:19 nbsp On G St, but I dont know where on G St. Users/JasonAller

20050219 16:19:47 nbsp The answers actually in the mural itself. It spanned the southwest to northwest corners of Second and G; the mural shows a view through the arch looking west, with the Anderson Bank Building on the right. Downtown back then was G Street; everything west of that was residential. The Arch was only in existence for less than a decade. Users/CentralDavisite

20140816 13:10:58 nbsp I agree with Constantia, but it should be in a place with more traffic so people will see the Davis glory. Maybe we could make the Richards Subway into an ArchTunnel? Users/chandru
