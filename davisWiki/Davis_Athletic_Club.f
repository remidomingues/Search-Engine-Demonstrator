 About the Club 

The Davis Athletic Club (DAC) has new membership fees for 2007 ($39 initiation fee, $49/month/person, $43/month for seniors 65+), and it is not a meat market like 24 Hour Fitness or the ARC.  Most of its members are local Davis families, high school athletes and UCD professors, most of whom are very friendly and helpful. The DAC is seldom crowded; only once has the original author of this text seen someone have to wait to use a treadmill machine. Among the amenities offered are 2 heated pools, a coed hot tub, a cardio room, a treadmill room, a Weight Rooms freeweight room, a circuit room, a steam room (available for the men only), mens sauna and womens sauna, a martial arts training room, an basketball indoor basketball court, an Goalgetters Indoor Soccer indoor soccer field, and many fitness classes. In September 2006, one of the two weight rooms received a makeover.

 Environmental Impact 
This is where the D.A.C. truly begins to rile a few members. They claim to have a desire to go green and state they are proenvironment, yet they are in a location which requires many residents to drive to, have stopped allowing the use of center owned towels (causing some to bring their own towels, while others have merely begun to use more and more of the onsite paper towels) and create quite a bit of paper waste through all of their on site and mailed pamphlets and brochures, workout trackers, data entry sheets and a slew of other items all of which waste paper and leave an environmental imprint. Dont claim to be environmentally friendly when you are, in fact, not by any means. Go in the late evening to watch them clean the facilities.. know where all of their cleaning solution end up? Right in the main sewer/flood control system of Davis. Used pool cleaners? Containers?  Right into the Davis Waste Management Landfill. Green is a term they either dont truly care about or are completely ignorant of its meaning.

 You do not have to drive to the Davis Athletic Club, you can bike. And they have not stopped allowing the use of center owned towels, if I am correct, they charge a dollar to borrow a towel(?), to sway from people using towels, and you can easily bring your own towel or wipe your sweat off on your shirt. You do not have to blame a business for trying to go green, the real going green part is for the person to do themself.  Users/NikhilDahal


The freeweight room received a makeover in September but the equipment still appears old. The heaviest dumbells are 100lbs and there is no incline bench in sight. This gym is not for the serious lifter. On the only occasion I have been at DAC the staff was very unprofessional, the gym was moderately crowded, the ambient temperature was higher than most gyms I attend, and there was no music playing. Perhaps it was just a bad day at the gym. JackRoehrig

20070705 23:08:53 nbsp I agree about local Davis families as the biggest users of this gym. I know several people who enjoy the indoor soccer or the basketball court. My perspective is quite prejudiced: my partner has taught group exercise classes at DAC for over 20 years. Shes often had groupies who really enjoyed her intensity, focus, and structured approach to step aerobics and Spinning (the classes she currently teaches). I mention this not just to toot her horn, but to show that this gym may not be for everyone, but between longtime staff and longtime members, it can have a friendly neighborhood feeling. Of course your experience may vary!  Users/DougWalter

20070906 10:36:43 nbsp I have been going to Peak Performance and have always liked it. We joined Davis Athltic Club a few months ago due to the swimming pool access, and its location.

I just want to mention my experience with the day care at this gym. Looks very nice and clean with an outdoor play area etc. etc.

I left my 2 year old and went to exercise.  I come back 45 minutes later and do not find my son in the room, I go outside, he is not there either. Turns out he had been crying the whole FORTY FIVE minutes and finally one of the child care expert had locked him in the bathroom with himself, supposedly trying to calm him down. Oh and the light were off too.

I was furious. Their behavior was totally unprofessional and criminal forget tender loving. Any mother would know How I felt and what  I felt like doing to the staff. The front desk and management did apologize but never heard from the guy who was actually involved. The best part, I was told he is one of their best people in the child care. Of course I have not had the courage to take him or any of my other children back there.

My feelings aside, I just want to mention this so parents are aware more careful and in case this happens more frequently, we can stop it. Users/dbh

20071020 20:36:49 nbsp Me and my wife have been going to DAC on and off for several years. I like the equipment and the atmosphere.  It is a clean gym and they have great staff.  It may not be in line with Golds for the professional bodybuilder, but if you want a good workout with a nice selection of equipment then DAC is the place to go.

20071203 01:01:04 nbsp My family and I just moved away from Davis :(, and this is one of the places that I miss the most. I loved going here everyday after work. You dont have to worry about it being a meatmarket type gym, since it is mostly a family type gym. The treadmills are the best, and the racquetball courts have great ventilation (which to me is most important, I cant stand stuffy courts).  My 5 yr old daughter LOVED going to the day care, and talked about the staff all the time. Her favorite was the guy that works there....I am surprised about the comment made about him, I was also told he was the best they had.  We have never had any problems, but then again we were only there for 4 months or so. They even hosted a parents night out event that was great fun for the kids (and parents)! I liked the gym so much because it was smaller than compared to say the ARC, but if you like those type of gyms than this is not the place for you. Users/RDN

20080115 14:28:41 nbsp having used the arc for the last 3 years, i really appreciate returning to DAC. the weight room is small but clean. if you are a very serious body builder, the lack of variety will bug you a bit (no neck machine, military press rack, of incline bench). nontheless, if you are at the beginner or intermediate level, it shuld be good enough for you. on a side note, thier parking lot is very small and always full. this is not a porblem for me, there is plenty of parking close by. however, every time i go to work out, i see a line of cars waiting for a parking spot. YOURE GOING TO GO WORKOUT!!!! DONT BE LAZY AND WAIT 20 MINUTES FOR A SPOT, OR LEAVE BECAUSE YOU CANT FIND ONE!!! Users/JeffIto

20080202 12:58:52 nbsp smells like a barn! Users/G.L.

20080330 09:49:04 nbsp Ive been going over to DAC since August 07 its not brand spanking new, but the equipment is in good condition and in working order, the people are nice and its not a meat market. It doesnt smell like a barn  and theyve recently redone the lap pool which is a big deal as Im a swimmer.  Its a great place for families. Users/kclementi

20080502 20:59:34 nbsp great family place and for working adults and senior not on the meat market, nor dating prowl...great staff, friendly, clean, realistic and kind....about the child care...always monitor before leaving your child with a complete stranger Users/BethC

20080515 21:44:51 nbsp If you need to park and cant find a spot, keep going on the street and take a left.  Take another left and follow this street until there is a little parking spot on the right.  I am purposely leaving out names of streets so my neighbors dont get mad at me.  That little parking lot is where the swimming pool is! Google map it! Users/Grant
   Or just hit the map button at the top of the entry...

20080708 17:38:24 nbsp The pool is a great benefit. The gym needs some improvements/updating. The carpet really needs to be cleaned, replaced or removed all together  its brown from dirt. They could use more ellipticals (and less stair masters), as they are the most popular. The staff is friendly and the overall atmosphere is comfortable. I noticed that one room has nothing in it now, so hopefully it will be used for better equipment.  Users/aml0515

20080710 19:13:16 nbsp I really like the DAC, but they need to do something about their parking lot. There are two driveways into the parking lot presumably one for entering and one for exiting; but since neither are marked, its impossible to know which is which. The parking lot is really narrow, and on a few occasions Ive had to back out into the street because the driveway I consider to be the entrance is considered to be the exit by someone else. It seems to be a needless safety hazard that could easily be solved by some painted arrows and/or some signs. Users/ifoundthistape

20080903 13:27:48 nbsp Can anyone help with the following questions about DAC.  I have send 4 emails and left 2 messages and have yet to receive a reply. Thanks
Here are the questions/concerns from the email I sent

1. Are all your childcare workers currently trained in child/infant CPR and child/infant Heimlich maneuver and first aid?  If not, when will then be trained?
2. Are toys/play areas cleaned on a hourly/daily basis in accordance with childcare standards?  Are non toxic chemical used on toys especially ones that children put in their mouths?
If not, how often are they cleaned and with which chemicals?  Is the MSDS present for these chemicals?
3. Where are your child center rules/information posted?  If possible please consider posting on your website and the door as you enter the childcare center.
4. How many children per adult?  What is the maximum number of children at any time?  How many infants?  How many adult are present at all time?
5. What is the time limited for children in the center?
6. Are bottles/ closed cup allowed?
7. What is your sick child policy?  Do your child care workers feel comfortable asking members not to leave their sick children?  I have seen sick children
in the center the three times I have been a guest and am wondering if the childcare workers feel uncomfortable asking member (who are often old enough to be their parents)
not to leave their sick children?  If your childcare workers feel uncomfortable it might be helpful (if the policy does exist), to post it on the door as you enter.

 Users/ACA
Please see the following email sent 6/13/08Chris,The childcare rules are posted next to the sign in sheet in the childcare.  Additional copies are kept in a literature holder on the wall outside the childcare door.  Most all your questions can be answered by obtaining a copy of childcare rules. I will happily mail you a copy if you would like to provide me with your address. Unfortunately I dont have a copy on my computer and cant email a copy to you. You are the first request we have had to have this posted online and I will certainly look into getting it available online.The childcare is cleaned daily. The toys are cleaned with a product called Triad and the MSDS sheet in kept in the laundry room.  Triad is for use in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, food service establishments, etc. The toys are wiped down with water after being wiped down with the disinfectant. The disinfectant is safe to be used on any surface or instrument that is introduced directly into the human body, bloodstream or mucous membranes.Everyone who works at DAC is required to be CPR/AED trained and it is the Directors job to make sure that new employees are not left alone in the childcare until certified.Please keep in mind that this is a free service to members children and not a licensed daycare.You are welcome to stop by anytime and speak with DAC staff and visit the childcare! Contact me anytime with questions!Jan RobinsonFinance ManagerDavis Athletic ClubP.S. We are locally owned and operated and wear many hats including teaching group exercise and plunging toilets! Often times we are so busy taking care of members on site that inquiries by phone/email dont get top priority. The best way to get information is to stop by! Parking is challanging but in 1981 when the club was built the city would only allow us 14 spaces. Hope that answers some of the above comments and concerns!Thanks

20090225 18:13:02 nbsp I love this club. It is old but very clean. The pool is fantastic and you can swim any time. The sauna for women is a plus. Users/rivert222

    Indeed it is.  Pretty common mistake, since the date for renewal can come and go without being noticed for awhile. jw

20091212 19:42:29 nbsp Really, really like this gym, overall :) From the reviews on this page, it seems that most people appreciate the fact that the place is not full of skinny girls that hog the cardio machines for hours and college jocks who do the same with the weights. However, as a fit, young woman in her 20s, I am a bit skeeved out at times by the older gentlemen who I catch staring at me whenever I look up. The concern goes both ways, generations.  Users/dontworryaboutit

20100221 14:58:34 nbsp Im a big fan of this gym, but i wish they would mark the driveways with arrows  I noticed that most people seem to go in the 2nd driveway, circle around and go out the first, but every once in a while a stray SUV comes in the first and blocks everything up. Users/mooodavis

20100324 12:27:23 nbsp The Davis Athletic Club is hands down the best gym in Davis.  The Staff is amazing, its a large facility, and I love that it is not a meat market.  When Im here, Im able to get my workouts in without any hassle.  My experience with my trainer was awesome.  She had a vast knowledge of health and fitness and I continue to use the program she designed me.  Parking seems to be an issue, but realistically, we are coming to work out.  Whats an extra 50 feet walking??  I love this gym and will continue come here as long as Im in Davis.  I highly recommend the DAC of all the gyms in town. Users/Mr.eNigma

20100803 19:41:14 nbsp if youre a student, youre guaranteed a 42 dollar a month deal with the kickboxing class  be sure to explicitly ask for this deal when you go in and sign your forms, otherwise theyll conveniently forget.  Be sure to check the amount charged on your bank account each month  it might save you a few good bucks if youre willing to be patient through the bureaucratic loopholes and dismissing attitudes once you get your money back.

The class is great  small class, you learn a lot, and Ty is a good instructor  but the finance sector and its treatment of their customers is a mix of incompetence and dishonesty, seemingly more so of the latter.  I wont drop any names, but whoever they end up transferring you to, be on the lookout.

Last thing  theres no such thing as Sunday openmat workout, something my friend and I were promised as part of the monthly deal. Users/withoutspaces Paul Chan

Harry is no longer associated with the Davis Athletic Club! The other programs/instructors will remain!Harry will be replaced with a Judo instructor who truly represents the sprit of Judo which emphasizes mental, moral and character development as much as it does physical training.

20100817 21:00:02 nbsp Forget this noname deal, this Harry character needs to be held accountable.  I just argued with him for 20 minutes at the gym.  He not only failed to resolve my issue from two weeks ago, there is now a new issue of overcharging my friend 30 dollars.  Yes, 30 dollars.  His logic was this: since my friend was undercharged for the last month (40, the promised student deal, instead of 55), he had to overcharge this month to compensate.  Uh, what?  Im not sure what planet hes from that a discount membership means undercharging the first month before overcompensating for the following month.  It was crystal clear that it would be a 40amonth membership deal.  My friend and I called him out  cause, you know, we took elementary math, too  and he responded by calling Ty over, who Harry carried the blame from our apparent stupidity of understanding the situation to Tys tendency to bring the fees up by himself sometimes.  Neither of us bought that, and Tys look was one of confusion and astonishment at Harrys remark.  More dismissal and condescension from Harry as the argument gets dragged out, and now were just talking on top of each other over a simple math problem.  My friend and I ejected ourselves from the conversation, canceled our membership with the girl working the counter, and were promised a refund for the overcharge, but were given no specific date.  We then laughed about Tys facial expressions at Harrys remarks until we drove the hell home.

It couldve been resolved as easily as an apology and a refund  we got anything but the former and the latter is tentative, and Harry has been a thorough jacklass through the entire ordeal.  Hes not going to get business from me or my friend, any of our friends in Davis looking for a gym, or hopefully anyone reading this as well.  That dude straight up fucking sucks, goddamn.  My theory is that aside from being the Northern California Judo Champion of his weight class, hes getting his double dragon black belt in irreparable people relations and shiteating business ventures via manipulative posturing he never left behind at the playground.  A giwearing grown man in his 40s knowingly ripping you off, then yelling over your complains by reciting 2nd grade math addition problems.  Take a second, sit where you are and imagine that shit for a second.  Yeah.  Thats been my experience. Users/withoutspaces Paul Chan

20100819 15:37:37 nbsp Decent gym, great kickboxing class, one shady Harry.

Harry is no longer associated with the Davis Athletic Club! The other programs/instructors will remain!Harry will be replaced with a Judo instructor who truly represents the sprit of Judo which emphasizes mental, moral and character development as much as it does physical training.

PROS: The gym has all the essential equipment (free weights, machines, etc.) and Ive never seen it crowded. At least compared to the ARC, where anytime after noon means overcrowding and waiting for most equipment. I havent used their sauna or pool, but that comes with the membership. They also have a nice little area where you can do stretches or hit the heavy bags.

CONS (buckle up): I joined the DAC because of the Muay Thai kickboxing class. I had taken Muay Thai with Ty at the ARC before, and decided to come to the DAC because hes an awesome instructor and overall cool guy. Harry, the Judo instructor, setup my membership. He promised me a $40/month student deal with no initiation fee. Everything seemed good until I was overcharged $30 only a month an a half into my membership. When I first asked him about this, he said, Dont worry about it, well take care of it. Okay, people make mistakes sometimes, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. When nothing happened almost two weeks later, I asked him about it again and he acted like hed never seen my friend and me before, Hey, you guys want to get signed up for a membership?

We pressed him about giving us a refund for overcharging us (yes, he overcharged both of us), and through a lot of indirect arguing, told us that most people were charged $55 for the Muay Thai class, so it was only fair for him to bring our rate up to $55/month as well. I told him my contract that HE DREW UP clearly says Im signed up for $40/month, to which he replied, Well do you have it WITH you? He had no response when I said I would bring it in...

Then he lied and blamed Ty for raising other peoples prices, even though Ty was standing right next to him. I dont care what the reason is, the fact that he did all of this behind our backs and assured us that everything was taken care of is explosive bull diarrhea. What a scoundrel. He loved our money so much, even after canceling our memberships on the spot, he still withheld any information on when/if we would even get our refunds.

The dude loves money. Much, much more than the wellbeing and loyalty of patrons. This sucks for Ty because the Muay Thai class is excellent and, I think, worth more than the $55/month they are asking, which is why its such a good deal for us poor college kids. However, with Harry behind the finances, no amount of ass coverage will save you from a nuclear screw.


I recommended the DAC to all my friends when I first signed up, and the Muay Thai class was getting a good flow of enrollment during that time, but now I wouldnt even recommend it to the richest person in Davis because Harry and his double dragon black belt in irreparable people relations and shiteating business ventures is bound to screw them over too.

20100819 21:56:27 nbsp Im a member of the Townies, and DAC is largely populated by beings of our ilk.  Nevertheless, its a great place to work out.  Generally, DAC is for people just people that are working out for health.  Its not about body building or dating, but rather simple access to comfortable place to work out. Sure, wed all love to be part of the dedicated Crossfit core that works out there, but few people can put in that dedication.

20101026 18:36:53 nbsp Our family was excited when we first joined DAC, especially for the warm water outdoor pool, but we soon learned that the warm pool is for adults only (except for six hours in the week) and that was not acceptable to us.  Even if NO ONE else is in the pool, children are not allowed in the training pool except for those six hours.  We spoke to the gym about altering the rules, and they werent open to changing them, so we asked for a refund and they gave it to us.  End of story.  Were moving over to Davis Swim & Fitness.

20101118 18:48:20 nbsp Wow. I am moving to Davis in January and I was hoping to join the DAC. However I am disturbed by the 2007 comment entry about the woman who found her 2 year old child locked up with a male child caregiver in the bathroom with the lights off. What was even more disturbing was the lack of concern on behalf of the DAC staff...I understand this happened 3 years ago, so maybe this was just a fluke. But this speaks very very poorly of their policy. That incident was WEIRD, extremely unprofessional, but, hopefully, totally innocent. Has anyone else out there had a good or bad experience at the DAC childacare center? Please comment...My child is one year old and I was hoping to find a nice place to leave him for an hour when I go work out. I will stay with him for the first few visits. But I hope that by 1 or 2 weeks I can leave him and go work out...But I don;t know what I would do if that situation ever happened to me.  Users/CarolinaWonder
  I think from the phrasing the child was locked up by himself, not with the childcare person. I could be wrong, but youd think someone would make more of a fuss if that was the case. Users/JoePomidor

20101120 19:28:32 nbsp Thanks for the reply. I hope youre right... I hope the mother just made a grammatical mistake (with shouldve been by)...Do you or anyone else have any personal opinions about the DACs childcare? Are there any other gyms/yoga studios, specialty or otherwise, in Davis that offer childcare? THANKS.  Users/CarolinaWonder

20101129 15:53:21 nbsp I use the childcare, along with my 3 girlfriends, 34x/week & LOVE it. Our kids range from 13 months4 years. SUCH a great place. The comment made was a TOTAL fluke. It makes me so sad that that was said about such a quality facility & outstanding childcare staff. They also calm down my 13 month old who screams & would ALWAYS pick up him & hold him if he was really upset. Let me know if you have more questions.  Users/soccermomma

20110125 10:34:07 nbsp I am so dissappointed with DAC  this used to be a nice facility and certainly the people are nice  but it is DIRTY!  I dont know why they dont do a better job of cleaning it  it used to be reasonably clean.  The womens locker room has clumps of hair and dirt and I never EVER walk on the floor with bare feet because it is just so disgusting!  Stuff that gets dirty seems to stay dirty  Im not sure if they ever do anything other than sweep the floors and even that is none too thorough.  The ick factor is pretty high there!  Ive been in lots of other clubs that are older but not dirty at least. Users/Weatherford

20110224 13:19:43 nbsp Great gym. It has a descent membership price, and the staff here is friendly.  Users/NikhilDahal

20110314 17:04:13 nbsp This seems to be the best gym in Davis as far as what I look for, sadly (they have a pool, aqua aerobics, good selection of group classes, and I can make a lot of the class times after I get off work). I say sadly because I wish Davis had more options to pick from.

Does anyone know if they ever waive initiation fees (either specials or early in the year)? I tend to join gyms on and off but I would hate to pay the fee every time (unless they only charge you the fee once at DAC?) Users/Ravyn

In a town with less and less to do every day, I go to DAC at least 6 times a week. Im in the best shape Ive ever been, and have learned a lot from other members about how to stay in good shape. The one really great thing about this gym is the dry sauna, which I use almost every time I come in. The service people are helpful and friendly..what else could you want? Users/JoshLawson

20110415 13:18:34 nbsp Walked in this morning after work to inquire about the facilities and offered programs. Amazed at how friendly and alert the staff was at 5am. The facilities seemed to be well maintained, it was a quiet atmosphere but was still fairly busy at this early hour.

Decided after a couple of hours to return and begin a membership. Really looking forward to getting my hands on the free weights and some of the cardio equipment.  Users/WesP

20110418 07:17:01 nbsp Wow... I never realized cheat machines could do so much work on ones body before. Always been more of a free weight guy before but the weight room had a few too many people for my taste/insecurity. Im not a super small guy, but Im not a hulk either.

Went in to work out for the first time here and, as sore as I am, I had a blast. My friend and I checked out the facilities on our own, warmed up on the treadmill (which was surprisingly fun and effective) and then moved on to the Nautilus machines... Every part of my upper body including my back is in pain but its a good pain.

I think these machines are great because there is no way you can screw up the exercise. They are focused on key parts of the body, are safe and efficient and the ease of adjustment helps you to keep pushing when the weight becomes too much allowing a truly full workout in a short time. The staff was friendly and welcoming and didnt make me feel uncomfortable or unwelcome and I will definitely be continuing this.  So glad I found the DAC! Users/WesP
     Props on being there at 5am. Users/NikhilDahal

20110712 19:55:07 nbsp No mention (yet) of the yoga classes they offer. Its not a huge component of the group exercise classes, but there are a couple of regular instructors, and Ive found their classes to be good. I appreciate the emphasis on having a challenging class, but with an eye to safety, the different ability levels represented, and our local tendency to personalize any program ;^)  Maybe someone with more experience of DAC yoga classes can add to this? Users/DougWalter

20110913 22:23:50 nbsp I love the DAC and mainly for the people that work there and the atmosphere. You can tell that the staff really care about the place, the members and they seem to enjoy their work. I have had the best teachers here for toddler soccer (coach Steve!), swim lessons and the daycare staff has been really terrific (Alex has always been one of my favorites! You cant find a better sitter. I enjoy the many, many classes, machines and terrific pool here. What a deal! You will like this place if you are not looking for a sparkling place with beautifully fit people (actually some of the instructors are beautifully fit!).  Users/Lasan

20111105 12:52:04 nbsp I took my kids to childcare yesterday and found out that Alex the childcare director was fired so the general manager Ryan Beede could give his girlfriend the job! Alex had been working at the Davis Athletic Club since she was 16, and shes sat for our kids at home for several years. Shes a lovely girly and did a good job for them. Im very saddened by this and also infuriated to say the least. My kids love her and we will continue to have her sit for our children at home. Very very bad. I hope this comes back to you 10 fold (it will).  Users/laurashearercotler
