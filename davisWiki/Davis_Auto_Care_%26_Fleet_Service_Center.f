20100409 07:23:57 nbsp Wow! You guys can work on all makes and models. Can you fix this too? http://www.secondose.com/donkeycar/ Users/dozer2

20100510 16:41:05 nbsp The service was quick and easy. And the guys were hotties :) Users/KatieP

20100702 14:07:17 nbsp These guys are awesome!  They definitely earn your business by going out of their way to help you and they offer (in my opinion) great customer service.  They just got my business... Users/e.gonzalo

20100708 13:07:45 nbsp Brandon and the guys at Davis Auto Care went above and beyond in their customer care. While waiting for my car, there was no doubt that they take pride in their work, they are honest, and made me feel right at home with friendly handshakes and good conversation. Their expertise and work ethic are admirable. They can handle any job that comes their way and have a shop that accomodates all complications that road travel may bring! You leave with a sense of security with your automobile and a newly developed loyalty that is difficult to find these days.  Users/kencolenzozz

20100802 15:31:06 nbsp I have been a customer of Davis Auto Care for a while now and I can honestly say that I have been treated superbly each and every time I have brought my car to their shop. I have an older Nissan and have been having a few problems with it but they have been able to take care of the problem at a very reasonable price and in a very timely manner. I would highly recommend them to my friends and family and to you if you are reading this looking for a place to take your car for repairs. Users/garybrown

20100804 18:03:07 nbsp These guys are great! I took my car in for an oil change and smog check  $62 total. WOW!!  Users/MeganCleary

20100804 18:29:16 nbsp I came here for the first time a few days ago (note my earlier comment) for an oil change and smog check.

An interior door handle was broken during an oil change, and while the manager, Brandon, said it was probably a simple wear and tear issue, he still replaced it for free. What I appreciate even more is that, while I was pretty pissed, Brandon was calm and courteous the whole time. He didnt let the fact that I was being a little bitch keep him from doing an incredible job. My friend just had a similar problem with another mechanic in town, and they fought her tooth and nail before replacing the broken part. I was expecting quite a fight, and when Brandon was so nice about it, I was really impressed.

During the oil change, these guys found a leak. I didnt notice the note on the paperwork, but when I noticed it, I brought the car back and asked about it. They immediately came over and I got my own NASCAR pit crew of 3 mechanics working on my car. They found the leak, an oring that wasnt properly seated. They fixed it for free, even though it took them hours to take apart and rebuild the distributor to reseat the oring. They were really friendly the whole time, chatting with me and my fiancee while they worked. Sadly, they made a mistake when putting it back together and had to hold the car for a day to fix it, but they were super nice about it, and didnt charge me anything for all of their hard work! They offered me a free ride home in their shuttle, too, but my fiancee came and picked me up.

I was planning to sell the car, and when I came back to pick it up, they gave the new car I was offered a free inspection, catching almost $1,000 of necessary maintenance that the sellers mechanic had missed! When they discovered a potential problem that would require continuing monitoring, they offered to test it for free every time I bring the car in for an oil change. They even cleaned and vacuumed my old car for free when I told them I was planning to sell it.

They disconnected an alarm in my old car, thinking it wasnt functional anymore, and when I told them it was still in use, they promised to install a new one for free, either in my old car or in my new one.

As soon as I bring my car in, they take me back to the bays and talk me through everything they do, which I really appreciate. Brandon is super friendly, and I really felt like he was looking out for me and my car. He really made me feel comfortable, and I know Ill be bringing my car back to them as long as Im in Davis!

I know it was making the guys crazy trying to deal with my car (which was being pretty uncooperative), but they spent hours and hours on it without charging me a dime. Brandon arrived early and stayed late for two days to get it fixed, even though the leak wasnt their fault. What other shop in town would do that? These guys are amazing. Maybe not the best if you are in a hurry, but they do an incredibly thorough job and are friendly and inexpensive to boot. Ill definitely be back with my car, and my fiancees! I love this place! Users/MeganCleary

20100824 21:36:21 nbsp I brought my Scion in cause I thought maybe there was an issue with the starter. They tested it out for me and didnt find a problem  so they didnt charge me for the diagnostics!

Nathan was great and I will be back! Users/kb21

20100921 17:18:47 nbsp No words but compliments whatsoever. I took my Ninja 250R for a oil change, but there were so many other things wrong with it including a flat tire!! Yet Brandon took care of it all in half a day. Brandon is not just meticulous and an expert in fixing up motorcycles, but he is also really personable. Best yet, Davis auto has the BEST QUOTES for students, so I highly recommend this place for any motorcyclists, or any drivers for that matter. Thanks so much!!! Users/MichelleHwang

20101012 18:27:30 nbsp New to Davis, just moved from MA. Came in for a smog check with an old 96 car. Brandon (fleet service mngr.) and Nathan (service mngr.) were both extremely friendly and helpful. My car failed the test, but they referred me to a muffler shop, Express Muffler in West Sac which installed a new catalytic converter for me ($250). The next day I was back and passed the smog test. I would definitely recommend Davis Auto Care; the guys I interacted with were very professional and knowledgeable. Users/StephenWright

20101029 18:57:31 nbsp thus far, everyone seems to have had good experiences with this shop. unfortunately, i have not.

i took my car in earlier this week to get my transmission fluid hoses fixed. they quoted me a reasonable rate  but not before telling me that they would charge me $80 for an estimate. thankfully, they didnt end up charging me $80 (and, suspiciously, after my father arrived on the scene), but still. kinda shady, especially because no one else mentioned on this page that they charge for estimates.

they did the work in a reasonable amount of time (2 days). no complaints about that. however, when i went to pick my car up, i found the car door open. WTF. seriously? you couldnt check to make sure you had properly closed my car door and locked my car? uncool.

AND on top of that, my car now shudders when its in idle and when i try to accelerate past 50 mph. prior to this entire fiasco, my car has never done that. so now i have to take my car back to another mechanic and get it fixed... thus wasting time that i really dont have.

so will i be coming back? hells to the no. i am one very upset and dissatisfied customer. Users/sugarpop

20101220 18:21:49 nbsp Davis and Hanlees have struck gold in their hire of Brandon Flood as General Manager of Davis Auto Care.  I have renewed trust in the autocare industry after my experience with both Brandon and Nathan in their dealings with my cars.  Their honesty and professionalism surpass any I have dealt with before them.  They have fixed the unfixable for me.  I was even further impressed to see Mr. Flood give back to the Davis community by creating a wonderful charity event for the Davis Schools Foundation.  Bravo to Davis Auto Care  Wouldnt go anywhere else!!!!!!! Users/BethCohen

20101220 18:36:09 nbsp Davis Auto Care and Fleet Service Center is great. My husband and I moved to Davis in July so I could go to UC Davis. We bought our first car together in November 2009, and so we were looking for a good place where we could become regulars, and Davis Auto Care was definitely the place. The people are nice, the prices are good, and I’ve always had a good experience when there. The only downside is their waiting room leaves much to be desired (doesn’t have wifi or a TV), but there is a diner down the street. Nathan has actually recognized my husband and me by name, and instantly recognized our car when she was in an accident. They always go above and beyond regular expectations. When our car needed new tires, I bought them somewhere else in town and brought them here because I like the quality of service that much. Like the above commenter, I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Users/Michellaneous

20101230 16:56:37 nbsp Its my first time there. They have a good costumer service. I went there for smog check today. Brandon promised that it would be done in 40 min. I sat there and did some reading, didnt even notice the time had passed. But because they took half more hour than they had promised, he appologized and charged me almost nothing. Users/kaitang

20110129 13:56:35 nbsp I went in for a smog check recently and was very satisfied with the service. The wait was not very long and the workers were helpful and friendly. While I was waiting, one of the workers asked me if I wanted to know more about cars and gave me an overview of different car parts. Would definitely come back again! Users/HeartAlong

20110203 14:11:00 nbsp This place is great! I took my car there when my fuel pump died, needed new thermostat housing, and a coolant flush. They were done in about 2 days. I also had to get a new motor mount for my car, and they finished that by the next day! Nathan is really friendly, helpful, and cares about you and your car. The 20% UCD student discount is also amazing! This has been the cheapest place Ive taken my car to but got great service in return. They also have a free shuttle if you need a ride somewhere while your car is being fixed, the driver is also really nice and friendly. My boyfriend brought his car here when it blew a head gasket and he liked the service as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially UCD students. Users/SMSdavis

20110206 20:32:22 nbsp Went in on 2011.02.02, and I had a very good experience.  After several days of back and forth emailing, Nathan found me a good price on the specific tires that I was looking for.  The price was ~$200 under what another davis shop was asking.  Not only did DAC give me a good price, but they let me watch the mounting and balancing!  Costco always makes me wait ~40ft away, where I cant see anything.  Nathan additionally talked with me about a check engine light that Ive had a hard time correcting.  Turns out he has a friend with the same car as me, so he said that hed ask his friend and get back to me.  Take home message: good price, good work, good service. Users/Alexander.S

20110219 15:31:56 nbsp These people are excellent. Not only did they do a smog check but also helped me remove my old license plates and screw in news ones at no extra charge. It was a 45 minute job to put the new plates because my old screws had rusted and had to be drilled out. I would recommend them to all my friends.  Users/DivyaAiyar

20110304 10:03:39 nbsp Another FANTASTIC experience from Nathan and Brandon!  Every time I visit Davis Auto Care to get my 2003 Ford Windstar Van serviced, Brandon and Nathan are very professional, reliable and honest.  They tell me exactly what needs to be done immediately and what can wait a while.  I truly appreciate the service I get from Davis Auto Care.  Thanks so much and I hope you are there for a long time!!!  Selena Thomas ~ Davis, CA Users/selenathomas@sbcglobal.net

20110427 11:43:52 nbsp I accidentally clipped the edge of my 2011 Nissan Altima last night when I was pulling into my garage, and pulled off part of the fender, scratched up the paint, and dislodged part of the undercarriage. I called my local Nissan dealership since Im new to the area, and I was referred to Davis Auto Care. When I called Susie she told me to come right over and they would see what they could do. Mike took my car back in the garage right away, and I was reassured that they could take care of the damage Id done to the fender and undercarriage. I was only there for about 30 minutes before Mike came back with my keys and brought me outside to check out my car; not only had he resecured the fender and undercarriage, but he had also buffed the scratched paint off the panel and headlight! Besides a few tiny chips where the paint was scratched past the primer, you cant even tell that there was ever a problem. I am more than thrilled with how my car looks, and to top it all off, they didnt even charge me for the time it took to fix everything! Susie and Mike are AMAZING, and I am definitely coming back to Davis Auto Care for all my maintenance and upkeep. As a woman, sometimes its intimidating to take my car in for maintenance because you hear horror stories about women being told, your blinker fluid is low and its only going to cost $50 to flush it out, but I know that I can trust Davis Auto Care to take care of all my cars needs from here on out. Thank you Susie and Mike, you are the best!!! Users/CaseyBarth

20110428 21:58:44 nbsp The service was quick and great. They were very kind. Especially Susie are very awesome! I would highly recommend this servis center to my friends. Users/SuCheolPark

20110517 16:55:39 nbsp I have been here several times in the past for basic maintenance and have always been satisfied with their work and their honesty, and appreciate their student discount.  Today, I took my car in to fix a broken alarm, and I have to give Brandon and Suzie major props.  Not only was my car fixed quickly, but they did not charge me anything, not even for labor, because the problem was a simple fix! I will DEFINITELY be back for any other auto service.  I appreciate their honesty and dedication to customer service! Users/StephanieChan

20110601 15:23:28 nbsp I totally recommend this lace to anyone who is looking for a fair, and honest auto place!! They are great people, and will work with you!! Thhey have fixed my car for me 2 time so far, and each time I walk away HAPPY!! Great People!  Users/FrankO

20110615 15:50:51 nbsp I needed my van back early, so I dropped it off at the night drop the prior evening and sure enough, my van was ready to go by 11:00 a.m. as I requested!  I finally had the pleasure of meeting Susie and she is wonderful!  Brandon is always helpful, professional and best of all...honest!  My van is a 2003 Ford Windstar and Davis Auto Care keeps it running smoothly.  I have been a long time customer and have never been disappointed.  They have a great coupon out right now for an oil/filter change that you cant beat.  Thanks again for another amazing experience!  Selena Thomas, Davis CA Users/selenathomas@sbcglobal.net

20110616 10:33:52 nbsp Made me wait a long time on the phone on several different occasions told me to bring the car right down, then when I got to the shop there was a three hour wait. They lost my business before even looking at the car. Users/ChrisPB

20110702 17:35:40 nbsp My first trip here was for a smog check. They told me they would be done with it by the end of the day or at least give me a status report. I didnt remember about it myself so I was surprised to receive a call from them at the end of the day apologizing for not calling me earlier about my car. The fact that they knew they made a mistake and took the initiative to apologize for it and not wait for me to complain really shows principle I think; added to the extra student discount they threw in, that I didnt even ask for or knew about, again shows that this place cares about being fair and honest with their customers.  Users/TuanTiet

20111212 17:49:36 nbsp Nathan and I would like to thank all of the loyal customers weve had throughout our time at DAC. We wish the best for all of you! We are in no way involved with the new Davis Auto Care, but we wish them the best of luck and success. Users/BRANDONFLOOD

20120201 09:49:35 nbsp I was super happy when they reopened only to find out the super friendly service from Brandon and Suzie are gone. I had a check engine light on and ask the lady to check it with their scan tool, they said they were too busy and told me to come back the next day. A scan tool check takes 5 minutes max. So I got a scan tool and found out it was an 02 sensor which I repaired for $120. I have been a loyal customer but will take my business to someplace that has friendly service.
