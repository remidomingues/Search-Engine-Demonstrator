Carol Freeland, ten years in business, runs Davis Babies, a new child care facility that she says is the best baby care Davis has to offer!  She adds that she is an experienced, licensed provider with a magical touch for babies and small children.

They have a playroom filled with beautiful castles and farms, puzzles and a wonderful childrens book collection.  Crystal moons in the east window cast circling rainbows over the playroom walls, spilling into the rest of the house.  A big, round table for art projects and beginning science experiments.  Blocky chairs that little ones cant fall out of.  Story time frequently during the day.  And a comfortable, old rocking chair that everyone loves.

When developmentally appropriate, Carol encourages little children to do for themselves:  dressing, getting water from the cooler or a tissue, reaching books and playthings from the shelves and returning them.

They have organic, fromscratch home cooking, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The kids help knead our own bread.  And they have chickens!

You provide are the diapers and change of clothes.  Pricing is:
  Full Time $800
  Part Time, 3 days a week, $600
