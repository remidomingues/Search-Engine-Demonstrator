About the Baháí Faith

The Bahá’í Faith is a world religion based on the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. He explained that there is only one God and one human family, and that all religions are spiritually united. Bahá’u’lláh’s writings offer spiritual guidance as well as directives for personal and social conduct.

The more than five million Bahá’ís around the world are engaged in the process of learning how to translate that guidance into realities of individual and community life. Though they come from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, they are united by their belief in Bahá’u’lláh and by their desire for a united, prosperous, and peaceful future for all of humanity.

The Bahá’í Faith recognizes the unity of God and of His Prophets, upholds the principle of an unfettered search after truth, condemns all forms of superstition and prejudice, teaches that the fundamental purpose of religion is to promote concord and harmony, that it must go handinhand with science, and that it constitutes the sole and ultimate basis of a peaceful, an ordered and progressive society. It inculcates the principle of equal opportunity, rights and privileges for both sexes, advocates compulsory education, abolishes extremes of poverty and wealth, exalts work performed in the spirit of service to the rank of worship, recommends the adoption of an auxiliary international language, and provides the necessary agencies for the establishment and safeguarding of a permanent and universal peace.

Meetings

Given that the Davis Bahai Community does not have its own center, gatherings for Bahai http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahá%27í_calendar#Months Feast and Holy Day celebrations are alternatively held in rented facilities and homes.

Bahai Grove

There is a Baháí Grove to the west of the Mrak Hall parking lot.


20101228 00:15:47 nbsp In order to become a Bahai, one should be seeking the faith of their own accord, first and foremost, without coercion or having been sought out by others already in the faith. Secondly, when and if the individual truly feels the faith is the answer for them, it is up to the individual either verbally or in writing to the ruling center (at least one on every continent: In the U.S. it is in Wilmette Illinois) by making the trek, a personal pilgrimage to the center to make this declaration.
