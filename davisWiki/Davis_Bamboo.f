Davis Bamboo is a local bamboo supplier.  They sell 50+ bamboo cultivars including clumping, running, full sun, intermediate sun, full shade, and drought tolerant varieties. Each sale comes with expert planting advice. Sales are preceded by a phone call to Davis Bamboo during which a conversation takes place about what kinds of bamboo plants best serve the customers needs. Appointments are also scheduled via telephone. Customers are asked to come to their appointment ontime and with a vehicle capable of transporting the bamboo if they find a bamboo plant they like (an open bed pickup truck with a tarp and rope are recommended). Plant prices start at $10 and the available potted bamboo plants range in size from 1 foot to 40 feet tall.
