Davis Barn Raising is a grassroots website dedicated to improving the quality of life of all Davis residents. It is a place for people to share and discuss specific ideas and plans. The goal is to empower regular people to team up in creative ways as opposed to simply relying upon traditional power structures to make important decisions.

Since sometimes even the best of ideas can flounder due to lack of social support or resources, the site aims to be a center for likeminded individuals to answer open calls for projects that embody common goodness. In whatever capacity they can (financial or otherwise), citizens are encouraged to support each other to achieve these worthy goals.

The principles guiding Davis Barn Raising were expounded at the final presentation of the 2013 TEDxDavis event by Bill Habicht, pastor of Davis Community Church.
