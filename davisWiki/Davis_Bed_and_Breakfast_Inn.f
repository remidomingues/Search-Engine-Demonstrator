20080906 15:24:26 nbsp Im a former employee, and while Im sad to see it (and subsequently, my job) go, I am happy to note that it is being renovated into studio apartments. I know we still have alot of vacancies, so if you want a studio apartment or a two bedroom townhouse right next to campus, then contact Acadian Properties. Still, I loved the Inn; best job I ever had. Users/ascapoccia
