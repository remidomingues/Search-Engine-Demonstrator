The Davis Bee Collective is a group of smallscale Honeybees beekeepers dedicated to the cooperative practice and promotion of ecological apiculture.  They have regular meetings and hold various beerelated events. Please join the http://groups.google.com:80/group/davis_bee_collective?hlen Google Group if you have any interest in beekeeping in Davis. This is a kind group of people with different levels of beekeeping experience and they are willing to share this knowledge with you.


 Services 

 Swarm Catching & Bee Removal 
If you have a swarm of honeybees at your home or business, theres a good chance one of the Bee Collective members will be able to remove it and find it a safe home.  Some hive removals may be extensive and come with a fee to be worked out with the beekeeper.

 Pollination 
Members of the Davis Bee Collective pool their hives to fill pollination contracts for organic farms in and around the Sacramento Valley.  All hives slated for pollination services are rigorously checked for strong health before transportation.

Workshops

 Screen Bottom Board Building 

On 200704, Davis Bee Collective members met up at the Domes to build screen bottom boards for their beehives.  The screen bottom boards allow for better varoa mite control by eliminating the ability of the mites to climb back onto the bees when they fall to the bottom.  The screen are especially effective when used in combination with other control measures that knock off the mites.  We used scavenged wood scraps to build the frames and 1/8 hardware cloth for the screens. A full image gallery is available online http://picasaweb.google.com/EliSarnat/DBCScreenBottomBoardBuilding here.


 As of March 2012, the bee collective members are hosting weekly Sunday 114pm work parties helping to create a local shared apiary and bee friendly garden called the Davis Bee Sanctuary  Opening Ceremony will be Saturday March 31st, 2012 116pm!

 Box Building Bonanza 

On 200703, Fourteen collective members got together at Dave Tiptons woodshop in Davis to build mediumdepth bee boxes.  It was a long and rewarding day.  We built 30 boxes complete with boxjoint corners and rabbets for hanging frames.  A full album and slide show of the event can be found http://picasaweb.google.com/EliSarnat/DBCBoxBuilding here.  Thanks to everyone who organized and participated in this event!

 Honey Extraction Party 
The Fall honey extraction party was on 200610.  We had about a dozen folks show up and use extractors to spin out over 150 pounds of the good stuff.  Thanks, bees!

 Equipment 
The Davis Bee Collective enables its members to share equipment amongst the group that may otherwise be too costly or cumbersome for individuals to possess on their own.  In this way we can all share in the use and maintenance of books, magazines, honey extractors, filters, pollen traps, wax melters, vehicles, carpentry tools and other equipment that makes beekeeping pleasurable.

 Videos 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?vSKGs3Qz1l4 First bee hive capture of the season:  Leanne, Tessa, Karl and Eli come to the rescue of a feral colony whose comb had fallen from a tree.  Eli climbs the tree, saws down the nest branch and passes it down to Karl.  Then the fun really starts!

The queen is a hybrid Russian/Carniolan bred for mite resistance and gentleness.  The cats name is Plucky, and no, she was not stung during the filming of this episode.

  George Kimball

Announcements
 Honey Extraction Party scheduled for Sunday, September 30th tentatively at the student coops at 11am.

 Renowned entomologist May Berenbaum will be gicing a public lecture on CCD titled, “BSI: The Case of the Disappearing Bees!” Tuesday, October 9th, 2007 at the Activities Recreation Center (ARC), Ballroom A. There is a reception at 5pm and the lecture at 5:30pm.

 1x12 redwood siding available for anyone interested in pulling it off a shed. Contact Carolyn (7581250)

Notes
 George Kimball is a new member. He has several hives all collected from swarms this year, and recently removed a colony from a shed wall (will show pictures next meeting).

 Eli queried the group if anyone was interested in participating in the Sacramento Children’s Fair, to which the Bee Collective was invited to present a bee booth. There were some good ideas for activities proposed by Julia, but none of the members present expressed strong interest in participating. Eli agreed to send out an email asking if other members are interested with the meeting notes.

  Discussion about the woodworking class continued. General consensus was that it would be better to have it at Dave Tipton’s house than at the craft center, but that we need to check in with Dave about several questions.


 November Meeting 
Proposal to plan a future meeting in conjunction with the Sacramento beekeeping group (name?) that meets 4th Tuesday (right?) of each month, or perhaps some Davis members could attend then report back…



          Lots of talk about potential for Experimental College course(s) – namely a beekeeping ‘workshop’ (mention made that in the off chance there’s a scheduling difficulty for spring, perhaps a weekend course might work as an introduction), ideally running the length of the quarter in order to take advantage of seasonal changes in practices (moving from winter to spring).  Eli to check on EC scheduling requirements, he also offers his bees (housed at the Student Farm) as educational props. (Does the group want to pitch in to formulate a syllabus, or Eli, are you ready to have at it? More discussion?)


          Idea of a Craft Center / EC course to build beeboxes – Chris to potentially offer it through the woodshop (after finding out scheduling requirements).


          For future reference, about the above 2 ideas (beeboxes & beekeeping classes), Jeff thought it might be a good idea to offer the boxmaking class in the winter before swarming time – so that people could have their boxes ready to catch local swarms.


          A lot of interest was expressed in becoming involved in the somewhatabandoned Bee Biology bees – perhaps being able to take over their care, in conjunction with providing opportunities for people to gain experience with bees.  Where do we go with this?


          Assertion of basic Bee Collective goals:  opportunity to ‘mingle’ with beeminded folks, sharing of experience & knowledge, pooling of resources that might be out of reach of individuals but which can be accessed & maintained by the group, learning environment for those without access to bees whereby they can ‘intern’ with folks with bees.


          Winter preparations were brought up – esp. in relation to methods of preventing wax moth infestation and a question was raised about availability of a freezer large enough to accommodate bee boxes (freezing kills the moth larvae).

Pollination Services

The biggest contribution that bees make in our lives is not the honey and beeswax they produce (but those are nice), but instead, the pollination of crops. Some Bee Collective beekeepers have hives that are available to rent for pollination services. Drop us a note if interested.

Better regulations on large scale transportation of bees; reduce stress, infection.
More research and outreach and care of native pollinators. Habitat network.
Better Funding.
HONEYBEE GENOME SEQUENCED IN ITS ENTIRETY!

Some talk of CCD followed. Bye!



 Dont you need a liscense from the state Structural Pest Control Board to remove bees from peoples homes / businesses / structures?  Users/KrisFricke
  As far as I know, no. No beekeeper I know of has a license for removal. But I could always check... KJM
    I think thats because commercial beekeepers dont usually do removals, and hobbyist beekeepers tend to fly under the radar.  http://www.pestboard.ca.gov/pestlaw/pestact.pdf California Structural Pest Control Act, current as of April 21st 2006, §8550: (a) It is unlawful for any individual to engage or offer to engage in the business or practice of structural pest control, as defined in Section 8505, unless he or she is licensed under this chapter. And the relevant part of cited §8505 the performance of, any of the following: identification of infestations or infections; the making of an inspection or inspections for the purpose of identifying or attempting to identify infestations or infections of household or other structures by such pests or organisms; ... the performance of any work including the making of structural repairs or replacements, ... for the purpose of eliminating, exterminating, controlling or preventing infestations or infections of such pests, or organisms. (sorry for the elipses, its a giant runon sentence of legalese)... unless you post $25,000 of insurance coverage (§8555)... it says there may still be regulations from the Fish & Game Code that apply in that situation however...  Anyway, the regulations can be found http://www.pestboard.ca.gov/pestlaw/pestact.pdf here.   Users/KrisFricke
    It would be a surprise to me if a beekeeper would be prosecuted for not shelling out $25,000 to be able to remove a cluster of bees. It could be, however, that they are merely being overlooked. Ill see what I can do to find out about it. Users/KarlMogel
       Quite a few codes like that apply only if youre charging money  basically engaging in business.  You might look for a preamble or definition section of the code.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20070912 10:22:00 nbsp Im expanding by 30 hives down here and could really use some bees if anyone has extras to spare.  Must be of known European descent (i.e. not from a feral colony). Users/KrisFricke
  Youre such a racist, Kris.  Users/BrentLaabs
   Plus, feral colonies are mostly German bees  you got something against Germans, too? Is Germany not part of Europe? tee hee. Users/KarlMogel
   Yeah, theyre probably not the Apis mellifera scutellata of originally Tanzanian ancestry (AKA Africanized Bees) up there, as I havent seen any reports of them north of Monterey, but my boss is quite insistent on purebred bees.  Incidentally, I would have guessed most feral bees, especially in Davis where youre surrounded by commercial bee activity, would have taken on the Italian ways of their commercial sisters (ie riding bee vespas out to the field and such).  Maybe German plus Italian averages to Austrian bees or something. Users/KrisFricke
    Axis Bees. :) KJM

20101009 17:58:50 nbsp Had a surprise late season bee swarm at my house.  Looked up Davis Bee Collective who recommended Derek.  He biked out right away and safely removed the bees and relocated their hive.  Derek was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Very positive experience, with the best possible outcome. Derek is awesome!
