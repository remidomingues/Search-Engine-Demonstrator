Davis Beer Week
http://www.davisbeerweek.com
Davis Beer Week founded by de Vere’s Irish Pub, strives to highlight and promote our community’s thriving craft beer culture. This 7day citywide festival will attract beer tourism, foster knowledge of our regional brewing heritage, and serve as a showcase for great beers, restaurants, pubs, and other businesses with ties to the craft beer community.

Enjoy an entire week of incredible beer events throughout the community, which will be capped off with our secondannual Bike & Brew Fest, an evening of entertainment, food, wine and beer benefiting the Davis United States Bicycling Hall of Fame!
