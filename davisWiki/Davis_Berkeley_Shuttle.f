UC Davis Davis Berkeley Shuttle shuttle provides transportation between the UC Davis and UC Berkeley campuses. This service is restricted to university affiliates. Carrying students, faculty, staff, and intercampus mail it makes twice daily weekday trips but does not operate on university holidays.

You need to show some sort of University of California ID such as a reg card or employee identification to purchase a ticket from any of the ticket outlets.  They usually dont check IDs on the bus, but you do need to sign the ticket stating that youre affiliated with the University of California University. To ensure a seat on the shuttle make a reservation on the website; on weekdays, you typically wont need one unless you take the early Monday/late Friday bus  even when the shuttle is fully reserved, there are almost always seats available on the departure date. With or without a reservation, you need to purchase a shuttle ticket at one of the ticket outlets  the website does not process transactions. Each transaction is a oneway fare, so be sure to purchase/reserve a ticket for your return trip if needed!

As of September 2009, a one way ticket now costs $9.75 and can only be purchased online by credit card. In addition, smaller shuttles are being used now instead of the larger coach buses due to the budget cuts. As a result, according to Fleet Service, only 16 spots are open for reservation.

The shuttle can save money for a trip into and past the Bay Area. Example: taking Amtrak from Davis to San Jose costs $30. Take the shuttle to Berkeley, take the downtown Berkeley BART to Millbrae ($4.10), transfer to http://www.caltrain.com/ Caltrain and arrive in San Jose ($4.25), total cost $18.10. And the savings and convenience increase when you need to get to San Francisco (~$8.65), SFO ($11.00), Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View (all $12.60), and many other Peninsula locations.

20050216 02:24:03 nbsp Dont forget to get a ticket for your ride back!!!! The first time I took the shuttle as a freshman I bought a oneway ticket and nobody explained to me that I had to make another reservation on a returning shuttle.  I planned to take the last shuttle back, and they happened to be booked because I didnt have a returning reservation.  Getting back to Davis was not fun without a car or shuttle...well maybe it was fun.  Anyway, my experience is another reason to hate TAPS... Users/BrianneCrabtree

20060509 21:00:16 nbsp So when you buy a ticket do they actually scan your reg card like at the ARC, or do you just have to show it to them like Unitrans? Users/AaGg

20070120 22:46:45 nbsp When you buy a ticket at the Freeborn ticket office you just show them your ID card. And Brainne, it says right on the ticket that its only one way: its your own fault you cant read dont blame TAPS Users/NathanielFurniss

20070604 00:46:05 nbsp agreed. its easypeasy when one can read. Users/GregoryGai

20070604 03:44:53 nbsp Does anybody know if there happen to bike accommodations on the bus? Users/LeonardMarque
    ive never seen anyone with a bike. maybe you could take a wheel off and put it under the bus with the luggage? Users/JessicaRockwell
    I just called their question line (530) 7525023 and they said that no, you cant bring a bike on the bus.  Users/KatherineChiu, 5/19/08

20070724 23:52:09 nbsp i was wondering if they scanned/swiped your reg card when you bought a ticket from davis to berkeley. do they write down your rec card id number? or just look at it? and is it true that you can purchase a ticket from someone waiting in line? do the tickets show info like: reg card number, name and such?

20080701 14:02:25 nbsp the article states that its cheaper to go to San Jose via SFO & BART from Berkeley. This is wrong. Its going to be cheaper (and comparable speed) to take BART to Fremont and then take a VTA express bus/shuttle to downtown San Jose. If youre trying to get somewhere else in the South Bay (like Palo Alto) then Id reccommend trying SamTrans Users/briangoldner

20080701 14:06:05 nbsp sometimes you can get the driver to drop you off at a place on campus if its near where they are going next. This is especially important if youre trying to make a connection. The last shuttle from Berkeley gets in to Davis at about the same time that the last UCDMC shuttle leaves for Sacramento. You may be able to make this connection if you politely ask the driver since the UCDMC stop is near the Fleet Services terminal. Users/briangoldner

20080707 16:44:39 nbsp The article doesnt say that taking the Caltrain is the cheapest way possible; just cheaper than Amtrak. The problem with SamTrans is that it only goes to Palo Alto, not any other South Bay locations. Getting to, say, Sunnyvale is much easier by Caltrain, and $1.75 cheaper than going to San Jose, since its in a nearer zone. Users/RaghavKrishnapriyan

20090113 14:10:58 nbsp You can also take the Alameda County Transit or ACTranist from Berkeley (F line) to San Francisco Bus Terminal. It costs you just 1.75 as compared to $4$5 when taking the BART. But this will surely be a loooooooong trip to SF. If it is day time and if you have a book to read and nothing on your schedule, this is the easiest way to save money. Users/Praveen

20090729 04:57:39 nbsp Is this service overseen or owned by ASUCD? if so, is it like a division of unitrans? Basically; who keeps the earnings? Users/amesguich
  Looks like its operated by Fleet Services, which is part of the Office of Administration. So no, not ASUCD/Unitrans. Users/jsogul

20091003 00:01:34 nbsp Worst experience!

I took the Berkeley shuttle over the summer many times, typically on fridays when its packed and everyone from standby made it in. But I when took it for the first time during the normal school year, only 16 spots can be reserved at any one time, and the monday and friday spots filled up quick. I dont know how can fleet service not provide larger coach bus for those days when they know that there will be a demand for trips to the Bay Area.  I actually had a good experience in the summer when they ran the coach buses, but after my recent experience with the change in services, I would say to avoid the shuttle unless you have a reservation. Users/KevinC

20101022 08:19:14 nbsp The shuttle system used to be a lot more forgiving back then to folks who miss the bus...Fleet services would give you a paper ticket that would last an entire year, so if you miss a 7:30am bus, you could always standby for the more popular 2:15 bus. Nowadays, they charge you electronically and will tell you to order another reservation if you miss it.  Really frustrating and I would just like to tell everyone to be on time for the bus, or else youve just lost $9.75. Users/JohnnyWu

20121021 21:26:11 nbsp FWIW, the website says that fares have been raised to $10.35 (plus $0.65 processing fee) effective 10/1/12, but I just bought a ticket for later this week and the site only charged me the old $9 fare. Users/DanVillarreal
