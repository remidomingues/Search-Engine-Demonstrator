Write the Bike Plan HELP WRITE THE NEXT DAVIS BIKE PLAN (2007)

Davis has been a leader in bicycle planning since the 1960s.  Since 2001, however, there have not been any major bike improvements in the bike plan.  Davis Public Works and the Bicycle Advisory Commission have been working on elements of the plan for the last nine months.  Now the public has the opportunity to suggest what we want Davis to look like in 20 yearswhat problems do we want fixed, what projects to we want built, and the programs do we want developed?

 The plans role is to identify all of the improvements in bicycle facilities do they can be planned for, budgeted, and built.  Topics include new bike overpasses/underpasses, bike lanes, better connections between existing bike routes, and finishing the Davis Greenway.  Also included is policy, from bike parking to bike education to bike law enforcement.  The overall plan is designed to promote respect and appreciation amongst users of the different modes of transportation

All bicyclistsfrom casual bicyclists to roadracing cyclistsare welcome to submit your proposals and ideas.

Kids on BikesWhat works, what doesnt, how can we improve?
General Meeting, Davis Lutheran Church, 8th and B.  7  9PM

Lots of kids ride bikes in Davis.  Its good for them.  It keeps them fit, gives them freedom, and provides serious competition to Playstations.  Kids on bikes are good for Davis, too.  It keeps cartraffic down at schools and on roads, and keeps Moms and Dads from playing taxidriver.

But, in a disturbing trend, lots of parents now drive their kids to school and sports practices in Davis.  Is bicycling falling out of vogue?  Can we do anything about it?

Come to learn, talk and scheme at the June Davis Bicycles! meeting.

Well start out talking about the 2006 Bike to AYSO program, which restructures city soccer tournaments so most games were within biking distance of teams neighborhoods, then encouraged kids to ride to games.  Dr. Susan Handy of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis will present the results of the program and discuss how it can be more effective next year.  Next, Amy King, coordinator of the May 2007 Davis Jr. High Global Warming Challenge, which encouraged kids to ride or walk to school.

Well talk about how these programs worked, how they can be expanded, and what we as a community can do to get more kids on bikes!

Whats Behind the Platinum CurtainTour of bicycle facilities in Davisgood and bad

This is a reminder to join Don Martinich on a sampling tour of some of Davis bike paths, streets, over and under crossings, and, perhaps, a few hazards.  We will leave from Central Park at the corner of B St. and Fifth at 10 AM.  Well ride through West Davis and then to the far northern boundary of the city, continuing down into East Davis and over the highway to the southern limits and then back into downtown. Then, I hope we can all get together for lunch  and and exchange views on what we saw. The ride should take about 2 hours. The pace will be very relaxed commute bikes are encouraged. Come join us and see whats Behind the Platinum Curtain.

p.s. It probably wouldnt hurt to bring water bottles as it may not be all that available along the route.

 Picnic in The Park and Work Bike Beauty Contest May General Meeting

You think you work hard?! Then take a few minutes and pay tribute to some of your hardestworking coworkers: bicycles!

Come join Davis Bicycles! for a potluck at Community Park on Monday, June 4th. Check out (and maybe even ride) some working bikes: kidcarrying, loadhefting, peoplemoving, human powered vehicles used in the U.S. and abroad. And then break bread with your fellow Davis bicycle enthusiasts and advocates. This is a purely social event, for we of likemind to take a few minutes to decompress and share good food, conversation and maybe even our vision for what we can do to make Davis again a world leader in bicycle use and promotion.

Work bike viewing starting at 6:00 pm
Potluck starting at 6:30 pm
Location: Community Park picnic tables under the solar panels (by the community pool).

Please bring a dish to share and Davis Bicycles! will provide the drinks. As a guide, if your family name begins with AM, please bring a main dish; NS, a side dish like bread, veggies or salad; and TZ, a dessert. In keeping with the good karma riding bikes bring, vegetarian dishes are encouraged. If you cant bring food, come anyway!

Please note this is Davis Bicycles! main membership group meeting, normally held on the fourth Monday of the month. This potluck was moved back a week to accommodate the holiday weekend.

And finally, if you have a working bike or a trailer or other conveyance that helps get things done, then bring it!

We look forward to an evening of sharing whats important: friends, food and bikes.

Davis commemorates 50 years of bicycling
http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/02/28/CityNews/Davis.Commemorates.50.Years.Of.Bicycling2747862.shtml, Wednesday, 20070228.
Group Message
Residents of Davis, California have gained much by being a bicycleoriented city. Bicycle use has benefits on many levels.  Bikes dont take up parking spaces downtown or on campus.  Bikes make people healthy.  Bikes dont pollute the air, or contribute to global climate change or the need for oilbased foreign policy.  Bikes are much less expensive to operate than cars or buses.  Bikes rarely run over children and small animals.

Davis has been known as The Bicycling Capital of America for over 40 years.  What was it that brought this condition into being?  Why didnt, say, Chico, CA, Tucson AZ or Corvallis, OR also become bicycling capitals?  Were there things that Davis had that nobody else did?  Is Davis secure in its title, or are other cities catching up?  And why is bicycle use declining in Davis?

Come take a 50year tour through Daviss bicycling history.  From Chancellor Emil Mrak and his 1961 ambitions to building a bicycling campus to current bicycling issues on campus today.  From the first bike lanes in Davis in 1967 to the Bike Tunnel under I80 in 2000.  Who were the people that made Davis a uniquely bicyclefriendly place?  What resistance did they face? How were they so successful?  Did they fall short of what might have been accomplished?   What are the challenges Davis faces today?  How do conditions today differ from 1960, 1970, or 1990?  What can we learn from past successes to guide current efforts to facilitate more biking in Davis. What can we expect in 2010, 2020 or 2040?

A clear thread through Daviss history is the importance of civic advocacy. When there are groups working together to overcome obstacles and  improve conditions for bicycling, improvements are made and more people bike.  But, in times where groups have been weak or lacking, little progress is made. We hope that with this presentation we can begin a new age of public advocacy for improved conditions for bicycling, and choose a future for Davis that builds upon our past.

Ted Buehler has spent two years researching the history of bicycling in Davis for a Masters Thesis in the Institute for Transportation Studies, UC Davis.  The event is a 50 minute presentation, followed by a halfhour QA/discussion.
