20081020 11:41:40 nbsp This year during foxys there was a really really good market set up by the high school and library. Lots of used stuff for dirt cheap, lots of campy and dura ace stuff for half off. All the people selling were very friendly, and were happy to answer questions. Definitely going again next year! yay altruism! Users/TheWigglyWizard

20090510 22:05:42 nbsp I just wanted to give a shout out to Davis Bike club cyclists, Laurie and I believe his name was Bob. Some friends and I showed up in Winters ready for a ride and missing a front wheel. Bob was generous enough to loan me his wheel so that we didnt have to haul back to Davis to fetch mine. Anyway, please pass on a heartfelt thanks. It is nice to see such helpfulness between fellow cyclists. Users/CarenRoma
