Bike Sale! Thanks to generous donations from Davis citizens we are having a bike sale and fixathon for the month of July. Come in during shop hours. Learn to fix your bicycle in style.
We have a lot of great Davis worthy commuter bikes and kids bikes. Cruisers, vintage mountain bikes, road bikes, steel frames, all different sizes and shapes, fun bikes, a tall bike, parts from everything from the last fifty years of cycle history.

The Davis Bike Collective is a volunteerrun nonprofit http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?titleList_of_Community_Bicycle_Groups#Criteria community bicycle organization.  They operate a public http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic D.I.Y. shop called Bike Forth where folks share tools, skills, and knowledge about bike maintenance and repair.  The also support many community bicycle related programs such as repair workshops, bike share and lending, etc. They accept donations of used bicycles and parts from the community and, in turn, make used parts available for anyone else to build or repair a bicycle.  They ask all patrons to contribute financially to the cooperative shop, but they dont turn anyone away for lack of funds.  Their aim is to empower confident and committed cyclists through education and community building, and to encourage more cyclists by making bikes and bike maintenance, fun, safe and accessible for everyone.

Between 2004 and 2009 they operated as the Bike Church Davis Bike Church from the The Domes Domes  on the UC Davis campus where we taught thousands of Davisites the way of the spoken wheel and pedal wrench in a quest for for community liberation, love, peace, and sustainability through appropriate technology and selfempowered transportation (i.e. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycles#Female_emancipation bicycles). We are now organized as an IRS wiki:WikiPedia:501(c) organization thanks to the fiscal sponsorship of the Solar Community Housing Association and venture onward with our mission at Bike Forth.

The Bike Collective specialize in the used market.  Used bikes can range from any brands once sold new in other shops locally since their inventory is based on donations.  On any given day, you might find Specialized, Trek, Cannondale, Cervelo, Colonago, BMC, Schwinn, Fuji, Raleigh, Bianchi, Giant, Gary Fisher, KHS, K2, Jamis, Klein, Scott, Santacruz, Intense, Electra and other classic/vintage brands in their doors.

Careful though, as with buying anything used, they are not authorized dealers for these brands and can not help you with any future warranty issues, other than what they provide in the shop.

20090421 00:28:52 nbsp Are there more details about what the community can do to help with the move, and specifically what address the new space is. Riding by it was completely unclear. What about fund raising goals or monthly budget? As someone who isnt in the inner circle, has hours but not dollars, its not clear how I can help. Users/AlexMandel

20090421 16:50:37 nbsp Meetings every Friday at 6pm, as per Bike Church page. For the first time, were going to hold our meeting this week in the new space. Users/Darach

20090424 11:50:11 nbsp Is the grand opening going to be a grand opening or is it just going to be like the first day of operation? Also, its really unclear where this actually is. Can you guys put up a graphic explaining or something? Users/jsogul
   Have you tried clicking the map icon?  Theres one on most wiki pages.
    My bad... I thought there wasnt a map icon but I was just looking in the wrong place. Users/jsogul
    I am often able to use google maps and street view, but the above link isnt working for me. If you are at the intersection of 4th and L, you want to look on the north side of the street: between Bikram Yoga Davis and Abbey Road Press there is a courtyard, and the Bike Collective should be visible in the northwest (back) corner. Users/DougWalter

20090426 00:59:55 nbsp

Biked by the old church site today and got confused. may i suggest you put up a big and legible sign outside the church to inform people of this move?

also where are the meetings held? Users/RaymondZhang

20090426 09:40:40 nbsp 20090421 16:50:37   Meetings every Friday at 6pm, as per Bike Church page. For the first time, were going to hold our meeting this week in the new space. —Darach

Well get some sinage up when we have the resources to do so.
 Users/Darach

20090426 13:11:14 nbsp Does the DBC have a preference about the type of bikes/parts donated?  Ill be skipping town soon and need to unload a bunch of stuff, but some of the frames and parts are from department store junkers. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20090427 08:48:32 nbsp We are working on signs and will get those out soon at the new and old location.
As for parts, we welcome all and any, but prefer not to get department store bikes (Magna, Huffy, Next, Roadmaster...).  Were working on creating an alternate use for these sorts of bikes, but are still working out the details.
To learn more about volunteering, sign up for our volunteer google group by searching Bike Forth Volunteer on google groups.  Well be sending emails out about how to help out and get involved.   Users/smcc

20090427 14:01:12 nbsp Id like to volunteer, but I cant seem to figure out how to find the Bike Forth Volunteer on the google group search.. Any help/suggestions?
 Users/LinaPlanuty

20090427 18:46:39 nbsp There seem to be two google groups, http://groups.google.com/group/bikeforthvolunteers and http://groups.google.com/group/bikeministry , what are they each for? Can an administrator of them explain on this page? Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger
   I assume that http://groups.google.com/group/bikeforthvolunteers Bike Forth Volunteers is the group for people who want to volunteer and help out at Bike Forth. The http://groups.google.com/group/bikeministry Bike Ministry group, I once again assume, is for the current ministers of the Davis Bike Collective (whom you can see on the Bike Church page). Users/Oleg.Lokhvitsky

 The Volunteers listserv is more or less inactive, though an occasional email will go out.  Anyone may join this listserv.  The ministry listserv is for internal operations, and pretty much anyone interested in getting flooded with email who wants to be useful for Bike Forth and who we more or less recognize from around the shop is welcome to request an invitation to join.   Users/Angel.York

20090428 15:55:41 nbsp Go to this link and you should be able to sign up for the google group for volunteers:  http://groups.google.com/group/bikeforthvolunteers.  This will get you signed up for the volunteer group.  The Bike Ministry group is for active ministers. Users/smcc

Pasture Ted, minister emeritus Users/TedBuehler

20090620 00:28:39 nbsp who put up that terrible photo of me?  im changing it. Users/SisterCat

20090630 02:55:04 nbsp These folks are signifigantly awesome. If you dont mind getting a little grease on your fingers, you can fix your bike very nicely and cheaply, plus youll know how to do it next time! Teach a man to fish, and all... The location is a bit hard to find: its across the street from the Quaker church, at the back of that little parking lot. Users/Flynn

20090713 22:39:01 nbsp Does the Bike Collective want 5 years of Bicycling Magazine for free, delivered by bike?  20042008 +/.  (Asked on facebook already, trying here too.)  Lemme know... Users/EdHenn

20090923 23:24:44 nbsp Matt and Friar Robby sure do rule! Users/StevenDaubert

20090925 23:44:06 nbsp The venerable Davis Bike Collective has saved my butt several times. You walk in with a sick bike, you ride out laughing skipping. Both riding and skipping. Theyre that good. They give you more than repairs, they give you new skills. I have taught my friends what I learned there, and they were seriously grateful. Users/Devonian

20100124 12:09:48 nbsp Bike 4th sure is awesome! Users/StevenDaubert

20100125 10:55:52 nbsp I must agree, this is a very awesome place.  Be sure to donate while you are there.  Davis needs a place like this to stay open for a long time.  Donate so they can pay rent and buy new tools/ equipment.  Everyone is so very nice and helpful, tools and equipment are well organized. Users/DagonJones

20100828 21:27:11 nbsp EXCELLENT PLACE! Great people.  Users/PeterM

20100908 23:33:19 nbsp It should be noted that you can get a newtoyou bike here, for far less than it would cost to get a new bike. They arent really in the business of selling bikes, but they do have a LOT of parts on hand that they are willing to let be built into a noble steed for the roads. Expect a LOT of grease, and you may wind up with a unique bike, but it will be roadworthy and sound. Users/Flynn

20101027 00:33:19 nbsp I was wondering if anyone knows about the average cost of building a bike here?  I would probably do almost all the labor myself, but in terms of parts? Users/superamazing123
   The usual guideline for building a bike from scratch is about half what it would go for on craigslist, which is normally between $10 and $80 depending on the bike.  And youll have to do ALL the labor yourself  but there are people around to explain anything you dont know how to fix. Users/DarinWick

20110508 08:47:06 nbsp Im pretty mechanicallyinclined and I hate to pay for services I can do myself. Enter: Bike 4th. Theyve got all of the tools youll need (and if they dont have it.. no, they have it). I didnt take advantage of the rummagethroughbins option but I certainly frequently use tools and stands. Theyve got a great support staff as well. Needless to say, this place offers a great service to the Davis community. Thanks! Users/ZElliott

20110905 23:03:39 nbsp I have the pleasure of having a secondhand 24 year old bike that is in constant need of tuneups, and the lovely people here have been there to help me along the way. Last time I was there they had enough patience to direct me how to open up and clean my back wheels axle. My bike never rode so smoothly. Users/MarisolG

20120408 01:03:04 nbsp We cancelled Tuesdays so that we can focus volunteer energy more reliably on the other open hours.   Users/Angel.York

20120813 08:00:40 nbsp My name is John Pecore, President of Bike 1st in Saint Petersburg Florida, a connection group with our Methodist church here.  What you have aspired to do, we are emulating here in Florida. I did not know that you existed until I did a search. We should keep in touch. Users/JohnPecore

  John, Youll want to join the Bike Collectives listserv on this page: http://www.bikecollectives.org/ .   users/angel.york

20140605 12:33:36 nbsp Wow I am appalled that this Bike shop could actually call themselves a Bike Collective when they lie to customers inquiring about other local bike shops in town sheepishly telling them that they have closed down for good.  I was looking for The Bike People bike shop that I knew was around the corner from the Bike Collective, but could not find it as they were no longer in their old location, so I asked the people from this shop if they knew where it was and they told me that The Bike People closed down for good as the main bike mechanic was sick.  I later found out from Kens Bike and Ski that the shop was still open and they directed me to their new shop location (just on the other side of their building) and sure enough they WERE OPEN!!!  I explained to them what the Bike Collective people had told me and they were shocked!!!!  The Bike People are not closed down and in fact are still a fully functioning bike shop.  They have been dealing with the loss of Mike, the bike legend I have known about, to his lung disease taking his life 1 month ago, but with the faithful and honest hard working real and true collective nature of other people involved with The Bike People, they are still open and working hard to keep the bike shop alive in honor of Mike.

DONT LISTEN TO THE BIKE COLLECTIVE IF THEY TELL YOU THE BIKE PEOPLE ARE CLOSED  AS THEY ARE JUST LYING TO YOU!!!  The people from the Bike Collective are not the kind of people I would ever want to do business with when they cant even work together with their own neighboring bike shops (that are doing completely different things anyways)!  The Bike Collective people could actually learn a few things from The Bike People as they like to work with their neighbors and will honestly direct their customers in the right direction if they dont have what you need.  Thats real collective attitudes! Users/katalina

DAVIS BIKE COLLECTIVE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ABOVE COMMENT: During the time Michael was sick there was a misunderstanding about the what Kim and the Bike People were going to do. Through conversations with the Bike People we understand that they are open still to help people with the sales of quality used bikes and excellent customer service. The nonprofit Davis Bike Collective, through the space the Bike Forth, has been committed to helping to teach people to fix their bikes since 2009 and before at the Domes as the Bike Church. We are always working to stay open and serve the Davis community through the help of our volunteer staff. We welcome all people of all skill levels to come help, learn, and teach people about bikes.

RANDOM COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE OF THE ABOVE COMMENT: Its rough that Mike passed. I didnt know that. The bike collective is NOT NOT NOT a shop. Its a collective, a non profit that will teach you how to fish instead of letting you pay for a fish. The above appears to be a miscommunication, every time Ive needed to use the bike church its come thru with flying colors, and all the volunteers are for the most part friendly & down to earth Daubert
