Davis Biodiesel Users Group (DBUG) is an organization interested in the promotion and distribution of Biodiesel fuel.  They are a membership based organization, loosely sponsored by the Davis Food Coop, and have periodic meetings.  The group is currently at capacity for users of our one distribution site, but would like to assist others in setting up another site. Discussion and details exist at the DBUG Google Group located http://groups.google.com/group/davisBUG?lnkgschg here.
