20100220 10:13:49 nbsp Im very interested, and will keep tabs on the dates.  Not sure whether March 2 will work for me, sadly.  Have you considered switching the organizing over from blogspot to this page? Users/TomGarberson

20100220 17:24:57 nbsp Good news: I found our copy of Civ and Advanced Civ, along with the laminated Westward Expansion map that we made probably 15 years ago.  Do you think the Board Gamers would be interested in a game of that on some Tuesday? Users/TomGarberson

20100221 15:18:09 nbsp Hi Tom, sorry that 3/2 wont work for you. Were on an every other week schedule, so maybe well see you on 3/16?  Users/BrianH

20120522 09:16:39 nbsp Dont let the tiny amount of content on this page fool you, the Davis Board Game group is active, friendly, easygoing and all around great. With rare exceptions they meet every other Tuesday, with updates posted on their Blogspot page and via an email list. Occasional weekend gatherings happen at the whim of members.The regular players have a great selection of board games between them, and new players are greeted with many offers of help with games.
DBG will be one of the things I will miss when I move away from Davis (The Davis Beer Shoppe and the city wide biking accommodations are the others) and I encourage people to join if they like board games. Users/JennSka
