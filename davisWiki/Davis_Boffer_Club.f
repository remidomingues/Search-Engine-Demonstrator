The Davis Boffer Club is a venue for kids who never outgrew the urge to hit each other with sticks. We build our own padded weapons, and participate in our own versions of more popular activities including capture the flag, steal the bacon, grand melees, and good old fashioned oneonone duels.

We are NOT a role playing or LARP group. Although we may appear similar on the outside, we operate more like a pickup game of Frisbee or a friendly game of tag, and we definitely dont take ourselves seriously.

So if you or anyone you know might be interested in a good workout doing a wacky college activity that wouldnt and couldnt happen anywhere else, send us a message or drop in on one of our meetings. Come to meet the interesting people, if nothing else!
