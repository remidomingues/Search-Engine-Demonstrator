Guidelines

Choosing Books to Read

The book for the following month will be chosen at the conclusion of each meeting.  The book will be decided on by a simple majority vote. The exception to this rule will be if a member can provide a valid reason for objecting to the majoritys choice. Please be advised that no work will be excluded simply because a member finds it offensive.  This is intended to be an open and liberal forum of discussion.  When in doubt, the group will side with the majority.

Membership

The only requirement is that you take the time to read the scheduled book before the meeting.

Discussion

Please be aware that this will be a group for discussion.  The meeting will require all members to be respectful of each other and to communicate their thoughts and ideas through nonviolent and nonthreatening verbal communication.

Structure of Meetings

The group will meet at 6:00pm on the first Monday of each month, and enter into free form discussion.  The last 20 minutes of each meeting will be used to choose the next book.  Meetings will run approximately 1 to 2 hours long.
