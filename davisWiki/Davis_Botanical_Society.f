According to their website, The Davis Botanical Society was established in 1999 to support the collections and programs of both the UC Davis Herbarium and the Botanical Conservatory UC Davis Botanical Conservatory. Membership gifts directly support membership activities and outreach materials, the herbarium and conservatory libraries, student research grants, and publication of our newsletter Lasthenia. The Society hosts a series of events, classes, open houses, and field trips each year.
