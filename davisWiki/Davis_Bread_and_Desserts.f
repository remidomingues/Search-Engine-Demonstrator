Oh, and ultradecadent chocolatey gooey goodness Jamoca Muffins. Homemade pies at the holidays. They also serve farmers markets in Sacramento, Pleasanton, and in summer: Reno, Tahoe, Truckee.

  Nice tip, that. Id be going to/leaving from Rocknasium and the smell of the bakery would just drive me nuts. Many a time Ive wanted to swing by and see if I could buy somethinganythingoff of them. Users/KevinChin

20071005 15:27:00 nbsp The bear claws at the farmers market are just amazing.  I am normally not a huge pastry fan, but they were terrific and the lady at the stand was incredibly sweet. Users/Casey

20140618 10:55:05 nbsp I just had to add a comment. Normally, I dont go out of my way to complain about a business. But a few months ago my 2year old was holding her $2.50 notyeteaten croissant right in front of the counter there and she dropped it. I asked the highschool girl if we could have another and she told me wed have to purchase another one as if it was a set policy. I mean really. Rules and profitability have to be balanced against customer service. Give me a break.  Users/Charles
