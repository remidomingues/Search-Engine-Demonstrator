20100304 01:32:37 nbsp Davis Cab is run by a single driver, Paul, who is the nicest, most alacritous driver in all of Davis. He has the best rates in town with the fastest response time. There is no better cab in town. Trust me, as an avid cab user of 4 years, there is no better choice than Paul of Davis Cab.

20100401 05:30:22 nbsp Did not show up for a ride to the airport. Seemed nice on the phone. Not sure what happened. I called and I got no answer. :( Users/DavidA2

20100407 23:06:31 nbsp OH MY GODDD!! This guys was ridiculous!! Our friend was stuck in Woodland from 1011 at night, an 18yrold girl with a dead phone which I told him and he still decided to NOT show up, not tell us he wasnt going to show up, and then avoid our calls while we attempted to ask how close he was. We ended up finally having to call the police. This guy is soooo unprofessional its not even funny, dont trust him if its something serious.  Users/daviscabhater

 The above two comments (koalas and Hannah1346) were posted from the same IP addresses IP address. Hannah also supposedly know enough about the business to change the “departed business” macro to “now Davis Cab” (see http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Taxi_Cab_Co.?actioninfo revisions). In any case, the phone number has been changed to the 5555 number, which has http://local.yahoo.com/info21737061davistaxicabcompanydavis two http://www.yelp.com/biz/davistaxicabdavis other sources validating it.

20100923 18:00:32 nbsp Just a shout out to the drivers at Davis Cab for throwing some of your overflow our way to Village. Paul, Ryan, and the other guys. We appreciate
it!!  David Max Placencia Users/DavidPlacencia

20101016 03:09:40 nbsp Wow. This was terrible. I used him twice before and he was decent in his time, 510 mins and good fare. BTW, Cash only. I created this account just  to tell you about my absolutely ridiculous experience. Me and my friend wanted to go downtown, he said 10 mins. After 10 mins, nothing, so i call him and call him and call him and call him again. Yes, no answer, got voicemail a few times, busy signal. The line went though well over 10 times in addition to a busy telephone line. I called this cab because the student run tipsy taxi failed to show up as well. I just decided to be DD, which what I should have done in the first place!! Basically: if you want a driver to not tell you he is running late, cant do it, phone is dying, or simply cant make it anymore. He ditched me and my friend, and left us out with no warning. AVOID this cab driver. go with college cab, I took them once actually.  anyway, this guy is on his own, with a mini gps, own cell, and car with DAVIS  cab on top. fancy huh?  Users/cleopatra

20110128 21:53:25 nbsp Called for a ride tonight.  Was told that he would be there in 510 mins and would call when he got there.  Never showed up, never called, didnt answer his phone when I called after waiting for 20 mins.  Just never heard from the dude again.  Very unreliable, obviously. Users/Jibbajaba

20120221 12:28:29 nbsp Great rates and was very professional. The other reviews kind of worried me, but I had a great experience coming from SMF to Tercero. Driver was courteous and didnt play terrible music! Users/MichaelYabut
