20071129 13:44:28 nbsp AGASA is going to an event that we think would interest the ACLU since it regards secularism.  We are planning on going to San Francisco on Tuesday, December 4th in support of Michael Newdows case to remove the under God portion of the Pledge of Allegiance and the In God we Trust phrase from our currency. The oral arguments for the first case will be given at 7:00am8:00am, and we will stay longer in case we can sit in on the trial. Users/CarlaIsabel
