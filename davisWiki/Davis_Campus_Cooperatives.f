https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Campus_Cooperatives Davis Campus Cooperatives is a California nonprofit corporation which provided cooperative student housing in Davis. The Wikipedia article says they still own Pacifico Student Cooperative Housing although governance of DCC is now coterminous with the NASCO Properties Board of Directors. The former concrete coops on Parkway Circle are now part of Frat Circle, although at least two (Pioneer and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyohiko_Kagawa Kagawa; the other two were Rainbow and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaweah_Colony Kaweah) continued as coops through 2006. A http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/fall03/campus_views.html description and paean to BioSci Life provides some insight into one of those coops.
