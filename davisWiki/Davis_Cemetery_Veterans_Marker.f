In the Davis Cemetery in front of the building by the flag pole is a marker honoring the the local casualties of several wars placed there by veterans and others wanting to remember the fallen. It is similar to the Veterans Memorial Building Marker one that is in front of the Veterans Memorial Building. Both markers were erected by Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6949 Post 6949 of the V.F.W.
