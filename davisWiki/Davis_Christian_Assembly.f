DCA strives to make everything about their celebration a building experience for all that come to participate.  DCA is a relatively young Religious and Spiritual Organizations church, but welcomes people of all ages. If you are looking for a church where the Word of God is preached, community is believed to be an essential part of purposeful living, and where the love of Jesus is shared then this may be the place for you.  You can visit their website for information on what activities they have going on during the week.  There are activities for ALL ages. DCA has church service at 10:30am on Sundays and it has midweek electives on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays starting at 6:30pm there are small group bible studies depending on age and gender. The midweek electives often are not held during breaks in the UC Davis Academic Calendar or during the summer.

DCA now has an evangelical Spanish service. This service is very energetic and is well attended. The Spanish Service is at 2pm on Sundays.
