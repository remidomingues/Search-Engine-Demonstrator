Davis Christian Fellowship (DCF) is an Student Organizations oncampus ministry.  Basically DCF is a whole bunch of people coming together to worship the LORD of the Universe.  DCF is associated with both Davis Christian Assembly, an Assemblies of God church, and Chi Alpha (pronounced Kai Alfa, http://www.chialpha.com), a national Christianity Christian organization.

There are large group meetings on Tuesdays in Hunt 100 at 8:00pm.  There are a number of smaller core groups (or Bible studies) that meet other nights of the week for more intimate fellowship. There are core groups for men, women, international students, STEP/EOP students, and all of the Freshmen freshmen dorms.

DCF also has a ministry center at 312 A St. and 3rd St., nextdoor to Davis Oshio Cafe and the Education Abroad Center. Upon entering the house, there is a prayer room to the left that is open to both students and adults for privacy and worship. There is also nice main lounge with sofas and chairs and a kitchen in which you can help yourself to community food. Most of the time either the two campus pastors or CMIT (Campus Missionaries in Training) interns will be in the office if you need to talk to someone for help or advice. All are welcome to come study or just relax!

The DCF House is open MondayFriday from 8am10pm (not including special events or parties that may go later).


If youre looking for a body of believers to belong to, you should definitely come check out DCF. They go on a retreat in the foothills for Fall fall quarter, a conferencestyle retreat for Winter winter quarter, a missions trip to an orphanage in Mexico for spring break, and engage in other special activities for Spring spring quarter.






20110502 20:50:10 nbsp I tried to go to this group after leaving Catalyst. Will pressed me to tell him why I left Catalyst and I gave in, but told him this had to stay between us. Then Will of course forwarded my emails to the leaders of Catalyst. Then I was told by Will Matt and I are friends so it would be better for everyone if you dont come back here. Shouldnt the fact that I love God be enough to be accepted in a Christian community? Users/Dozer

20110510 16:38:09 nbsp I LOVE DCF! Everyone is always so welcoming and I love how they allow God to do what He does best  just move and love on people. Although I originally sought out DCF because of its affiliation with Chi Alpha, I came to see that the fellowship is a hodgepodge of different denominations and backgrounds. I transferred to Davis and have enjoyed being a part of this amazing fellowship for the past three years. As I get ready to leave and move on, I am sad that I will no longer have such a great community behind me. God totally works through DCF, Will, Jen, Jack, Renee, and all of the CMIT interns! Ive made friends that I will treasure throughout the rest of my life! I praise God for such a great community. If you want a place to discuss serious issues, worship God freely, hear from God frequently, and just be yourself...choose DCF! You wont regret it...I sure didnt. Users/KimWong

20110512 18:04:47 nbsp I didnt choose DCF, but they threw me out. If God is working through DCF does this also mean that I am not wanted by God? Users/Dozer
  Dozer, you are desperately wanted by God. He loves you so much. Human love cannot even come close to the love that God has for you and the amazing destiny that He has for you.  Users/KimWong

20110515 20:44:19 nbsp Then why was I banned from DCF? In Corinthians it speaks of removing a man from church when they have done wrong. I do not know what I did to DCF. But is there a time limit to how long I have to live outside community before I am allowed to return? Users/Dozer

20110814 20:37:53 nbsp The people that go to DCF are some of the most godly people Ive ever met.  Their lives revolve around him.  Its unreal.  There is so much love here. Users/HaydenStephan

20110821 22:29:03 nbsp I agree with Hayden 100% about the people who go to DFC. But I just dont agree with how the staff abuses their positions. Users/Dozer

20111106 20:01:33 nbsp The three years I spent in Davis were so amazing, so full of joy becuase of my family at DCF. I will never forget my time here in this nonjudgemental place. You will feel like family here, becuase we ARE! Even if you do choose another fellowship, I just want to say how much a campus ministry (and of them) can change your life. I have so many friends as a result of this fellowship. We should rename it, Davis Christian Family lol, but true! Users/BryceH

20130415 18:26:25 nbsp I loved the people in DCF a lot, so friendly. However, I felt pressured to speak in tongues and exercise spiritual gifts that I did not have during the long repetitive worship sets. There is a huge emphasis on charismatic gifts like prophecy and speaking in tongues, so if you dont have these gifts you may feel uncomfortable worshiping with this group. Users/AnBan
