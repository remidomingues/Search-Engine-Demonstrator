In late January 2009, local owner/enthusiast Users/ClarkVineyard ClarkVineyard organized a small classic car get together.  Due to the enthusiasm of the attendees, a second meet was planned and the Davis Classic Car Club (DCCC) was created.

The DCCC was comprised of Davis residents who own classic (pre1976), predominantly American cars and trucks.  The car or truck can be in any condition, running or not.  Part of the DCCCs goal was to inspire and help people to get their classics back on the road.

The DCCC had meetings on the last Saturday of every month, usually in one of the Davis High School Parking lots, to check out other cars, hang out, and swap stories.  It was a very casual and relaxed environment.

As of Summer 2010, the DCCC is no longer active

For those who still want to be a part of the classic car community, the Davis CruiseIn is a classic car show held monthly on the third Tuesday of the month, in The Marketplace in front of Big 5 Sporting Goods.
