A Short History of DCD

Our earliest known records consist of photocopied SOAC (Student Organizations and Activities Center, the precursor to SPAC) registration forms dating back to 1982, with the Registration of Young Democrats at UC Davis. At the time of registration, the club had 42 members.

The most recent incarnation of DCD occurred when Cecilia EscamillaGreenwald and Users/ScottLay Scott Lay refounded the club and separately served as president in the 1990s. The club was formed as an alternative to the thenexisting Davis Young Democrats, which the founders argued was too focused on campus politics and not enough on state and national issues and elections.

DCD President Avi Singh successfully ran for ASUCD Senate as an Independent in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.

On November 12th, 2006 the DCD declined to endorse ASUCD Senate candidates by refusing to suspend its bylaws.

On November 26th, 2006 DCD members voted to approve a club constitutional amendment allowing them the ability to endorse registered Democrats running for ASUCD Senate and ASUCD President. Then prominent members Mario Lopez, Users/MaxMikalonis Max Mikalonis, and Steve Ostrowski voted for the amendment while Joseph Bleckman and Users/AngelaPourtabib voted against.

During the May of 2007, a second Constitutional Amendment updated the offices of the club, created new committees, resolved bylaw conflicts, and undid the November amendment, once again requiring candidates for ASUCD Senate and Executive Offices to be active members of the Davis College Democrats.

DCD hosted Bill Clinton @ UC Davis on January 15, 2008, where he spoke to a packed crowd of over 7800 in the The Pavilion at ARC ARC Pavilion, with another 3500 being unfortunately turned away. This was one of the many accomplishments that led to DCD being named the California College Democrats Chapter of the Year.

DCD has become increasingly involved with ASUCD, first backing DCD members Jack Zwald and Previn Witana in their successful election ASUCD Senate, and then again in their successful bid to be ASUCD President and ASUCD Vice President.

Members of DCD have become increasingly involved with the Yolo County Democratic Central Committee (YCDCC), where as of July 30, 2010 they held two of the six officer positions, and the Democratic State Central Committee (DSCC) which many prominent members won election to via the Assembly District Election Meetings (or ADEMs).

Former DCD President, Sam Mahood also served as the statewide California College Democrats (CCD) Vice President of Finance, and DCD Vice President of Political Affairs, Kelsey McQuaid, served as the CCD Communications Director. DCD has had significant fundraising success over the last several years through our Indigo Awards fundraiser, which was pioneered during the tenure of thenDCD President Max Mikalonis by thenDCD VP of Membership Don Gibson.

DCD had the honor of hosting President Bill Clinton on campus once again on October 9, 2012 in a rally to support Congressman John Garamendi, Congressman Jerry McNerney, Dr. Ami Bera (now Congressman), and Jose Hernandez for their election bids. Over 8,000 people were in attendance, and DCD was given the opportunity to meet and take a picture with former President Clinton, making for a memorable election cycle.

20092010

Membership – Throughout Fall Quarter, the meetings consistently packed Wellman 212. In midOctober, DCD sent 28 students to Lake Tahoe for the California Young Democrats’ biennial political training. Additionally in midApril, DCD carpooled 13 students to Los Angeles for the California Democratic Party’s annual state convention.  Of those 13 students, 11 were voting delegates on endorsements and party platforms.

Finances – Behind the work of President Craig and Vice President of Finance Sam Mahood, DCD returned to a financial stability. Under Vice President of Finance Mahood, DCD hosted the most successful fundraiser in club history and one of the most successful in California College Democrats.

Voter Registration – Due to hard work and unique methods during an offelection year, DCD was able to register over 500 students to vote in fall of 2009 (half of which registered were democrats).  This total ranked second amongst California College Democrats chapters and they were recognized for their efforts at Lake Tahoe with the “SuperObama” cutout they still use to table on the quad.

Campaigns – DCD was able to perform campaign invasions in Congressional District 10 for thenLieutenant Governor John Garamendi and Assembly Districts 5 (which was flipped from Republic to Democrat in the 2010 election) and 9 (which we held following Dave Jones’s election as Insurance Commissioner). Throughout September and October, DCD connected interested students to the “Yes on Measure P” campaign in Davis, which allowed students to gain valuable campaign experience.  In lateOctober and earlyNovember, Craig was in Maine campaigning for “No on Question 1”, their equivalent of Proposition 8.

Lobbying – Due to the fact that it was on offelection year, DCD focused on getting its voice heard via lobbying.  Throughout the year, they lobbied on behalf of higher education and voting reform.  DCD met with the offices of four state legislators in Spring Quarter, but the best example of lobbying was in December when Craig and Vice President of Communications Kelsey McQuaid spoke before the Joint Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education.

External Organizations – DCDers became deeply involved in outside Democratic organizations as a result of their work.  Craig, McQuaid, Jack Zwald, and Max Mikalonis served as officers for the Yolo County Democratic Central Committee (as Secretary, Executive Director, Vice Chair, and Parliamentarian, respectively).  Don Gibson served as the ’09’10 Political Director for the California College Democrats and McQuaid and Mahood were elected as ’10’11 California College Democrats Communications Director and Vice President of Finance, respectively.

20060425 20:44:27 nbsp Levy is also heavily republican backed.... Users/JamesSchwab
  This makes sense given that there are no Republicans running (since Forbes just registered Decline to State). Theyve got to vote for somebody. My guess is that those will be Ruth and Mike, given Stans strong antiCovell Village stance.
  Additionally, on Mikes page, he does not list the Republican endorsement (if there is one). This indicates that he is willing to fight for city council election solely on the merits of his own, liberal, platform, as opposed to as a figure that has been backed by a several political parties. When the DCD interviewed him, he said he didnt know if the Republicans had endorsed him. Users/MaxMikalonis
  In Davis, it is political death to say you are supported by Republicans. Mike told some conservative people on the ASUCD that Republicans are backing and working for him, so either he is telling the truth or lying and trying to ride the fence. Users/JamesSchwab

20060425 21:14:36 nbsp Well good thing the position is nonpartisan... although word on the street says that the Republicans actually havent endorsed him... but Im sure whoever you heard that from wouldnt mislead you James Users/AngelaPourtabib

20061003 23:30:24 nbsp I was rather pissed today at DCD. I planned on attending the Meeting @ 8 PM at 212 Wellman. It was closed. Fortunately for many of the classes planning on meeting there, signs had been posted redirecting people to various places. No such luck with DCD. I went to Cafe Roma to see if maybe theyd congregated over there; no such luck. SS

20061003 23:47:11 nbsp We actually went to the Coffee House to have our meeting tonight. We didnt actually know that classes were redirecting people so I guess this time was just a case of bad luck. Users/AngelaPourtabib

It really wasnt bad luck. Im not affiliated with the Democrat or Republican group on campus, but I received this message after joining the DCD Facebook Group. It was sent out just last night at 11:30 P.M. by your vicepresident:

The DCD are Having their First meeting of the Quarter this Tuesday, October 3rd, at 8pm in Wellman 212.
During this meeting we will be Revising and Discussing our plans for the following weeks, including when we can Table to Increase our Visibility, Promote our Candidates, and Educate    the UCD Public on the Issues We Stand For.
We have a Table, We have Materials, and We have a Plan... All we need now is For YOU to attend Our Meeting and Together We Can Make The Difference!
See you tomorrow!
Max Mikalonis
Davis College Democrats Vice President

I showed up to Wellman Hall 10 minutes early. There were several groups and multiple postings of cancelled classes, groups that were being directed elsewhere and so on. It wasnt bad luck that I couldnt find anyone affiliated with DCD, nor was it bad luck that I used my phone to search the Wiki, your website as well as several administative pages on the Facebook only to not find even 1 contact number or update to find out what had happened. The only clue I had was that the Wiki mentioned you meet at Cafe Roma as well. Nothing was going on over there either.

Really, I dont mind the goof. It was a little disappointing, but it wasnt bad luck either. I only want to point this out now because it seems obvious you guys need to regroup on recruiting methods. SS

20061004 02:19:12 nbsp Saul, Perhaps we left too late, perhaps you didnt see us, but we did gather as a group by the lawn, there WERE people affiliated with DCD in the area, and several new members did come with us to the CoHo, though I do know of two other than you that slipped through the cracks because of the impromptu room changes. That being said, I cant control the plumbing in Wellman Hall, and our Main Event is actually NEXT Tuesdays Meeting as opposed to This Tuesdays, so everything else so far has been closer to Icing on the Cake. Users/MaxMikalonis

I really hope that with next fall we can rush many more people into the great causes that we support. Also does anyone want to write a resolution in support of making sodexho employees UC employees? Users/DonGibson

20070724 01:01:22 nbsp DCD should endorse Dennis Kucinich and invite him to come to our meeting. Users/GregWebb

20071003 10:25:02 nbsp Cecilia Escamilla Greenwald told me about how the Davis College Dems came around in the early 90s, so she might have more information about how it started. Also, Im going to ask George Andrews about Igor Berman who I believe was President of DCD back in 0001 and then jumped ship to DCR, and which left the club a little disorganized for a few years. Thats what I remember from a previous conversation with George and Avi. Users/JamesSchwab

20071028 17:06:47 nbsp I think Cecilia was in the mid 1990s and Scott was the late 90s. Users/JamesSchwab
  Actually, Cecilia and I were at the same time (199496).  The campuss previous organization, Davis Young Democrats, had become overly involved (in our opinion) in campus politics, and wasnt affiliated with the statewide California College Democrats, California Young Democrats or the national College Democrats of America.  Since I was president of California College Democrats at the time I transferred from Orange Coast College, we pushed Davis Young Democrats to affiliate, but it just wasnt their thing.  Thus, after fighting the student activities bureaucracy for separate recognition (by then, DYD President Peter Nguyen was president of ASUCD, and felt that the clubs were competing), and with the help of Cinthia HamnerPortugal (who served as Regional Director of College Democrats of America) and others, we got the club off the ground.  We did have a tradition of working with DCR in a mutually beneficial way.  We never had rallies together, but sponsored debates and forums that increased the visibility of party politics (rather than just ASUCD politics) on campus.  Of course, this was during and after the Contract with America year of 1994 and through Clintons 1996 reelection, so the parties looked starkly different.  Users/ScottLay
    Thanks! Do you know what happened with DCD during the middle ages of 9701? Users/JamesSchwab
    Very Interesting. We actually have a member who is interested in speaking with our previous Presidents in order to get the groups history down on paper. Shes starting with Angela, but will be talking with yourself and Cecilia soon enough. Users/MaxMikalonis Max Mikalonis
    The story of Igor Birman being president and jumping parties is true, and a few other leaders struggled to maintain activism.  Also, DCD got caught up in the same thing that was the downfall of the Davis Young DemocratsASUCD politics.  So, someone would run for leadership of DCD as a conduit to getting elected to ASUCD rather than to provide a connection to state and national politics.  And, frankly, few things turn off more people than state and national politics, but student government is one.  (I can say this as past president of the Law Students Association at King Hall and someone that did a lot of statewide student government stuff, albeit not ASUCD.)  Most importantly, however, campus political activism goes in waves.  The everyones safe redistricting didnt help...many of us came together on campus to fight to save Congressman Vic Fazio in the 1994 Republican landslide.  Vic was in line (3rd of 4th) to be Speaker of the House, and he was in a competitive seat.  Across the state, young Democrats and Republicans used to find their connection to politics through local Assembly, State Senate and Congressional campaigns.  Those campaigns are just not exciting anymore, at least in the general election.  More often, were fighting within parties (see the race between two good friends of mine Cabaldon v. Yamada for an example).  So, instead of having a big fight to win the 8th AD in the general, when Democrats are united as one, we spend a year divided over who the nominee is, and that nominee is almost certainly going to win the seat in the general. Anyway, thats far more than you asked for!Users/ScottLay
        Thanks again! Thats a great insight about the affects of safe districts on party involvement too.Users/JamesSchwab

20071126 23:28:02 nbsp What rally did DCD and DCR both participate in? Users/JamesSchwab
they raised money for the families of fallen soldiers. I wasnt a big fan of how the rally went down (DCR insisted on the pledge and the national anthem) but there are worse things in the world people can devote their time to. Andrew

The event was fantastic and Im pretty sure one of my friends recorded it, so when it hits YouTube, links will be posted. We will be doing another one in April, and itll be even better.
