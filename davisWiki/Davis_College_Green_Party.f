The group has lead the Fair Trade campaign on campus to boost awareness of trade issues and get the CoHo to provide a larger selection of fair trade coffees and produce.

The Davis College Green Party led the original fight in the winter of 20022003 to get Choice Voting for ASUCD elections.  Their members have continued to be active democracy supporters  keeping Choice Voting at ASUCD and supporting the efforts of groups like Davis Citizens for Representation to move Choice Voting along at the city level (for Davis City Council elections).

Green Party member Users/ChrisJerdonek helped create the Stovetop software that made the election analysis for the Choice Voting ranked results of the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election possible. Check out http://davischoicevoting.org for complete election analysis.

20120901 19:45:23 nbsp If someone manages this page, a lot of links are dead. Also it seems as though this group is dead as well; the group site has been parked by someone else. The current president last had activity in 2008.

Just a flag for anyone who is remotely interested in repairing this page. Users/TheOneElectronic
