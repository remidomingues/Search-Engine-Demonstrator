Davis College Republicans (DCR) is a conservative political group on the UC Davis campus and a chapter of California College Republicans, which is a state chapter of the College Republican National Committee. As an active conservative group on campus, DCR provides much needed diversity to a leftleaning campus. DCR provides, to quote Paul Harvey, The rest of the story for those individuals interested in keeping an open mind toward both political parties.

In addition to providing much needed diversity, DCR has served as a steppingstone for many members into the field of politics. The current occupations alumni range from Campaign Managers for targeted (real) Assembly and Senate Races to Congressional Legislative Directors. It serves as a very valuable asset to the California Republican Party through the various objectives of the club: ranging from providing training resources for new members to assisting with grassroots Republican efforts.

The determination to establish a solid conservative presence on the UC Davis campus has made DCR historically one of the most successful campus clubs in California.  DCR membership ballooned to over 800 in the 200304 school year, making it one of the largest clubs on campus.

DCR guest speakers in 2005 included Actor and Comedian John Ohurley, Former US Treasurer Rosario Marin, Former Congressman Jim Rogan, Author and activist wiki:wikipedia:David_Horowitz_(conservative_writer) David http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?titleDavid_Horowitz_(exMarxist) Horowitz, and KFBK talk show host Mark Williams.  In 2007 DCR brought former PLO terrorist Walid Shoebat to Freeborn Hall to give a lecture on the dangers of terrorism and radicalism.

Because varying beliefs can be found even within the membership of political parties, DCR does not officially endorse Republican candidates who are competing in primary elections with other Republicans. Naturally whatever the outcome of the primary election in question may be, DCR will support the Republican Partys nominee for that particular office. DCR does provide a forum for its members to meet others who may be supporting their preferred candidate and will allow them to pursue building their own coalitions.

They encourage all students who have conservative inclinations of any kind to join and invite anyone who is curious to attend one of their weekly meetings and meet the group. Weekly meetings may consist of discussing policy issues, examining candidates, listening to speakers from off campus, and giving students a forum to discuss passions and frustrations.

20070301 23:31:32 nbsp Was DCR affiliated with the Cindy Sheehan protest? Users/StevenDaubert

  20070301 23:34:02 nbsp There were some Republican members but I cant confirm if it was an official group function Users/SteveOstrowski

   20070302 20:23:00 nbsp Did you mean to say that you arent sure if it was an official group function? The phrasing as it is leaves open the possibility that you know and you just cant say. Users/JasonAller
   I am going to talk to an officer in DCR to confirm either way.  A lot of them were at the protests but DCR wasnt in a position to control everyone who just happened to be there protesting. DCR can certaintly tell people what is going on, but it may not have been an official event.   Users/SteveOstrowski
 In afterthought and for the record I knew the guy who championed it and how he was tied to DCR (before I asked) I just wanted to watch Steve hem and haw with some BS.  Users/StevenDaubert

20080628 19:07:16 nbsp Im glad you guys post the names of the people who run your jolly band of mislead morons. Users/Kicker
  Im glad you find yourself able to engage in meaningful, mutually respectful discourse. users/JoePomidor

20080923 14:34:17 nbsp In the 20062007 academic year they offered free tap beers at woodstocks along with pizza and bread sticks.  Pretty much the best free food event I was ever able to attend. Users/600burger

20081126 08:21:08 nbsp Have you guys thought about getting protection as a minority group on campus? I dont envy you. I dont sympathize either. But I definitely dont envy you. Users/condemned2bfree
  Why would they need protection?   Users/DavidGrundler
  What does protection as a minority group even mean? Armed guards? Convoys? Helicopter escorts? Users/PaulHarms
  The ACLU would be a nice start.  GregWebb

20110922 23:23:21 nbsp Hi everyone! I was wondering if anyone who is going to the event on Saturday would be willing to carpool. Let me know! Thanks :) Users/CarliCiatti
  Well I guess you made it to the veterans bike ride the week after! We are glad to have you as part of our club, and this is a message for those who seek to keep us in the closet, WE ARE BACK! and we are not afraid to stand for what we know, in our hearts, is right. Users/JonathanSooHoo


20111002 20:33:01 nbsp Wish I was around when they used to do some http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/highereducation/ucberkeleyrepublicansholddiversitybakesaleheatupdebateoveraffirmativeaction/2011/09/27/gIQA1UI70K_story.html IRL trolling. Now theyre all just oriented towards creating career politicians. Thats no fun. Users/hankim
  20111002 23:34:24 nbsp I would hardly call trying to increase diversity trolling. The inherent racist nature of affirmative action is hardly defined as trolling, but rather a serious issue, and a serious problem in American society. Additionally, we will be doing more activities, for example, today more than 10 republicans went to San Francisco to support a wounded veterans bike ride.  Users/JonathanSooHoo
     Trolling  doing something to get a rise out of someone. In a place like Berkeley, going against anything like affirmative action is trolling the majority of its inhabitants. Users/hankim
         Trolling denigrates the message that we supported, a message of increasing diversity. Users/JonathanSooHoo
           You guys really have a stick up your asses now. Users/hankim

20111002 20:34:25 nbsp Does the DCR take a stand on the Tea Party? Users/CovertProfessor
  20111002 23:39:46 nbsp  I am not sure if the Davis College Republicans stand for the Tea Party, perhaps I can explain exactly what the Davis College Republicans stand for, and you can make your own assessment: We, at DCR, stand for the notion that fiscal responsibility is not an outdated idea, and that a government with a 14 trillion dollar deficit should not rely on just raising the debt ceiling, with no serious plan of how to reduce the deficit is simply unsustainable.  While we, as a group, do support social conservative causes, we focus mainly on the economic policies, which leadership in Washington, all too often, neglects. As an aggregate, we think that Barack Obama has failed America, not the other way around. President Obama campaigned on a message of hope and change, as message South Carolina Senator Jim Demint described as Conservative, but instead President Obama has delivered nothing more than the same old politics of Washington DC, where the words of fiscal responsibility ring upon deaf ears.   Users/JonathanSooHoo
    Hmm, doesnt really answer the question.  Surely those who care enough about politics to join a group like this are familiar enough with the Tea Party to be able to judge whether or not they agree.  Instead, it seems as though you are well on your way to being politicians yourselves.   Users/CovertProfessor
     It does, everyone has different definitions of what the tea party is, and there is even debate among us, about what the tea party means.  I simply told you what we believe, and I will let you make your own judgement. To quote a President, “It’s precisely the pursuit of ideological purity, the rigid orthodoxy, and the sheer predictability of our current debate, that keeps us from finding new ways to meet the challenges we face as a country. It’s what keeps us locked in ‘either/or’ thinking”.Users/JonathanSooHoo
       Ok, I will be more specific.  Do you support Rick Perry?  Michele Bachmann?  etc.  cp
        We, as a college republican group, have not endorsed any candidate for President. While some do support Governor Perry, others also support Governor Romney, or Huntsman. Actually, we do not all agree on who is best. I personally, not speaking for the club, am undecided. As for Michele Bachmann, as far as I know, none of the officers support her, we have a large club, so I do not want to speak for the other members. Users/JonathanSooHoo
          To be honest, this is the sort of answer I really expected you to give in the first place, something like, we disagree on the Tea Party, some in favor, some not.  But I thought Id ask anyway in case the answer was different than I expected.  I certainly didnt expect a wishywashy politicianstyle nonanswer, though!  But now, reading between the lines, I get the feeling that you all consider yourselves Tea Partiers, but that you disagree about what it means to be a Tea Partier.  And that is quite interesting.   Users/CovertProfessor
           I responded by explaining that there actually is an S at the end of the Davis College Republicans, as odd as it sounds, we received over 120 sign ups in the first week, we had over 30 people at our first meeting.  So really, my point is this simple: when you have such an abundance of opinions, it is not easy to say DCR supports the Tea party or DCR supports Michele Bachmann. I cannot speak for other members, and I will not  its simply not fair for you to ask me that, then when I tell you we have a diverse group of opinions, cast my answer as politicianstyle. Personally, I do not consider myself a tea partier, but do agree with some, albeit not all, of the things they say. Users/JonathanSooHoo
             No, go back and look at your original response.  You could have just said, The DCR doesnt take a stand on the Tea Party, because its members disagree.  But you did not say that.  I think you need to work on your straightforward answers.  cp
    Typical career politician response. DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM! Users/hankim
      I guess you could say I probably shouldnt even respond to this but I will: far from it actually, I mean ideas of fiscal responsibility, talk of a 14 trillion dollar deficit, and having a plan to actually reduce it? Frankly, that does not sound like a career politician response, but it sounds like SOME CHANGE WE CAN ALL BELIEVE IN! Users/JonathanSooHoo
         Actually, that line is used so much these days that its even coming from the Democrats. Users/hankim
          Well certainly it has not been through their actions. I cannot tell you how many people I have talked to who told me that they dont really consider themselves Republican, but they are sick and tired of the failed economic policies of the Obama administration. Users/JonathanSooHoo
            And I cant tell you how many Republicans who have told me that they are disgusted with the craziness of the Tea Party, and want to leave their party because of it.  cp

20111004 00:28:25 nbsp Agreed that this club actually used to be far more interesting.  The active membership TANKED between 2007 until 2009 because instead of being a place for people interested in some aspect of conservative/libertarian politics to hang out, do some cool things (yup trolling indeed) and drink, it became just another political machine interested only in the phony politics of making/working for politicians.  Its that crap that turned off a neighbor of mine from joining after he attended a few meetings last year. LAME and depressing.   Users/OliviaY
