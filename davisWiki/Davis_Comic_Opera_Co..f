20080903 21:37:28 nbsp As a member of the board of directors at Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento, Id love to clarify.  We are not merging with Davis Comic Opera, though Sean Bianco (once artistic director of Davis Comic Opera) has been our musical director since 2004.  Our company is not in fact closing its doors nor does it have any plans to do so.  Thanks. Users/kebaad
