Davis Commons is the small Shopping Centers shopping center on the corner of 1st St. and Richards Blvd. at E St.

Davis Commons was completed in 1997, amid protest that the arrival of Davis first corporate chain bookstore, Borders, would drive out smaller independent booksellers. (Several did actually Departed Businesses close shortly thereafter, including The Next Chapter, Coffee & Classics, and Gayles Books). And then in 2011 Borders (the whole chain) itself closed, with Whole Foods Market Whole Foods as the new tenant, amid worry that its arrival would threaten the Davis Food Coop, Nugget, and other preexisting grocery stores, especially while the town was still absorbing the recent arrival of Trader Joes (often see as a competitor to Whole Foods).

Davis Commons was featured on the ABC Nightly News as an example of appropriate development for the 21st Century. (In all fairness, though, Davis Commons is preferable to the standard shoeboxstyle strip mall, like Fifth Street Plaza.)

The tract of land that is now Davis Commons was once a Native American village, which was another reason for controversy around the building of the center. Interestingly, the burial ground for the village was also built over; its called the Mondavi Center.

Mark Friedman, president of Fulcrum Properties, built and owns Davis Commons; it was developed by two local firms, Pyramid Construction and Cunningham Engineering Corporation.

Does anyone have a picture of the sculpture of a man in a box that used to be in at the end of the pictured walkway?

  I remember it being a woman?  Of course, that was a long time ago.
