Davis Community Acupuncture Clinic (DCAC) is a great way to be able to take care of yourself  physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. Acupuncture treatments are conducted in one large room (since points used are typically below the knees and elbows, no disrobing is required). There is an additional healing quality to the group dynamic  like the difference between group meditation and meditating alone. Everyone gets more out of it. There is a $20$40 sliding scale that is pay what you choose (plus a $10 consultation and paperwork fee added to your initial visit). Its easy to bring a friend and get treated at the same time.



DCAC was founded by Itay Neta, L.Ac.  Itay (pronounced like eatThai) Neta, LAc holds Masters degrees from both the New England School of Acupuncture and the Acupuncture & Integrative Medical College, Berkeley.

     Itay practices a very gentle style of acupuncture — one in which the patient feels no discomfort.  Treatments are gentle and calming, allowing patients to relax completely.

     Itays innate intuitive ability combined with his training in acupuncture, medical qi gong, reiki, craniosacral therapy and visceral manipulation afford him insight into the individual patients overall condition.  Itay has successfully treated a thousands of people since 2002 with a broad range of ailments including ObGyn, emotional, and pain management issues.


About acupuncture

     Acupuncture is the science and art of stimulating the bodys natural ability to heal.  It focuses on the whole person, not just the symptom or the disease.  Over thousands of years, acupuncture has evolved to effectively treat most modern ailments, including many where Western medicine may have limited solutions.

How does acupuncture work?

     In order for a muscle, joint or organ to function well, there must be adequate blood flow to that area.   Most if not all of the imbalances that occur in the body can be traced back to a lack of sufficient blood supply to the affected location.  To help the body recover from injury, overuse or misuse, acupuncture can increase blood flow to a specific region of the body in a targeted way.  Many descriptions of acupuncture talk about energy or qi and how it flows through the body.  This is simply an ancient Chinese way of describing the flow of blood and its nutritional components.

     Systemic conditions (for example sleep problems, mental/emotional/spiritual issues, or addictions) are addressed by regulating the blood flow through the entire body, as opposed to a specific body part.

     Through the use of needles and other gentle techniques, our blood flow is corrected.  This is felt as an alleviation of symptoms and an overall sense of health, happiness, and wellbeing.

Is it safe?
     Perfectly. The sterile needles are used once and then disposed of immediately. Also, since treatment is tailored to the individual, sideeffects are virtually unheardof.

But I HATE needles!!
	The hairthin needles that we use are much smaller than what many people usually think of as “needles.” Many people fall asleep during the treatment because its so relaxing.

Whom can it help?
     Anyone!  Students, teachers, yogis and yoginis, construction workers, servers, cashiers, programmers, and anyone who sits or stands all day.  Treatment is tailored to age and condition.


What can acupuncture treat?
Most symptoms can be improved or alleviated completely including:
  Physical pain
  Emotional concerns
  Respiratory, circulatory and digestive issues
  ObGyn
  Colds, flus, other infections
  Addiction
  Side effects of medications

  Other benefits: a strong immune system, good sleep, healthy digestion and more rapid postoperative healing and paralysis/poststroke rehabilitation

Come in and let me prove it to you! Users/itayneta

20080612 02:16:28 nbsp What kind of treatment do you offer for detox, withdrawal, and general drug addiction therapy?  Can you document any successes you have had in the past?   Users/Jbmx

20080829 23:33:39 nbsp As far as detox, withdrawal, and drug addiction are concerned, the treatment help reduce cravings, stabilize mood, and help the body process the accumulation of toxins that have been built up over time. While the same set of points has been used successfully to treat opiate and other hard drug addiction, my primary experience is with smoking cessation. The primary reason for this is that other drugs are usually treated in the context of a rehab clinic where acupuncture is just one part of the treatment. I am hoping to team up with such a facility in the near future.

Smokers getting acupuncture tend to find less satisfaction from the cigarettes and often say, They dont taste the same. This reaction is the beginning of them breaking the cycle. Any addiction is a complicated process that involves many lifestyle and psychological changes. Acupuncture can help mitigate the withdrawal symptoms and cravings while providing a gentle calming effect in a very stressful time.   Users/itayneta

20081208 12:01:02 nbsp Can acupuncture effectively treat an upper eyelid twitch? I have had this twitch for going on 9 months now, and I have tried everything else!! Users/eewalk

20090405 23:33:48 nbsp Sorry, just noticed the eye twitch post. Though I have had success with solving this in the past, every situation is different and everyone responds differently.  Users/itayneta

20090610 18:27:03 nbsp Thank goodness for Itay and the DCAC. We are so lucky to have so knowledgeable and attuned an acupuncturist in this community, and in a completely affordable community clinic to boot. Itays treatments have done wonder for a variety of physical aches and pains, digestive issues, and other system imbalances Ive had in the last year, and everyone I know whos ever been to see him has had the same amazing response to his treatments. He is exceedingly generous with his time, attention, and energy. The synergistic effect of being in a room with other patients during treatments is incomparable. I cant stop recommending the DCAC to everyone around me... Users/calvin2

20100505 11:27:14 nbsp I came here during the week of my due date and absolutely loved it.  I wish that I would have come throughout my entire pregnancy because it would have helped with the many aches and pains of pregnancy.  I always felt completely relaxed when leaving here  there is not another method I have experienced to reach this state of extrarelaxation.  I will definitely go back. Users/Cynthianh

20100607 09:21:48 nbsp What is the problem with some pain if thats going help you be healthier? Im not saying that Itays acupunture is, or not, painless; I am trying to say that a bit of pain isnt going to kill anybody, and there are worse things than a stinging needle, as for example open heart surgeries, injections, amputations and dental treatments. A stinging needle should not stop anyone from trying this wonderful healing art. Beats being sick. Users/Alex.

20100923 06:23:42 nbsp Im curious how successful acupuncture can be for vertigo symptoms? Specifically, I have Menieres disease symptoms. Terribly frustrating and sometimes debilitating. Had surgery in Feb to correct (endolymphatic shunt) which helped, but symptoms have returned.  Users/ZachSmith

            Sorry about the delay. I answer questions much more quickly when they are emailed to me directly. Menieres is often treatable with acupuncture. Each case is different, so theres no way to predict your results. The best approach is to try a few sessions and see what kind of response you get. (Similar to trying a medication  no way of knowing whether itll work for you without trying it for a little while.) Aside from individual differences, the other thing that makes this a difficult question to answer is that Chinese Medicine classifies conditions in a different way than Western Medicine, so I would need to see you to get a sense of whats really going on and why.

20101023 10:00:32 nbsp I found this place while jogging on Covell Blv. a few months ago, when I had long given it up looking for affordable acupuncture in Davis. I am glad I have found it. The prices are just right, the place is clean and quiet, and Itay does a great job. The presence of other people in the treatment room does not bother me, though I find it a bit difficult having to whisper when I speak with the practitioner. But this is not a big deal when weighted against all the benefits of the treatment. I truly encourage everyone to come by and see if acupuncture works for them. I don’t think there is any other way to know. Randomized trials and statistics on randomized trials of acupuncture do not address one’s individual needs and potentials. And it doesn’t “hurt”, come on!   Users/AlessandraRung

20101218 23:06:52 nbsp I have been coming here for a couple months for joint pain and have been very impressed with the experience.  I have noticed a significant reduction in pain and Itay is a very compassionate and caring person.  He cares deeply for his patiens and will spend lots of time talking to you and offering suggestions that will help you outside of his clinic.  I recommend him highly and encourage everyone to try this...you will not be disappointed!  Users/KMeo

20110210 09:47:27 nbsp Does this sort of treatment work for nerve pain? Specifically, meralgia paresthetica. My doctor told me it wouldnt, but Im still curious to see if it would. Users/ChristyMarsden

            Since acupuncture has such a low risk of side effects, the easy answer to Does acupuncture work for (blank)? is Try it and find out. Unfortunately, theres no way of predicting how acupuncture will work in any given case. Meralgia paresthetica is something that will most likely improve with acupuncture. Id be happy to answer any further questions you may have via email since I dont check the wiki very often. Users/itayneta

20111116 14:08:58 nbsp I went in for a treatment with Laura a few days back and had a great experience. Highly recommended!  Users/Jhkochan
