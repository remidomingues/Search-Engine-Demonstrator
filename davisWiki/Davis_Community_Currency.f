20090210 16:10:58 nbsp This is ridiculous.  In order to get this you would have to either A) pay part of peoples salary in this DCC, B) have people convert cash into it or C) have it be like coupons.  In the case of A) I would be extremely resentful, as I do not buy anything but food from Davis preferring the economical solutions offered online.  In the case of B) I would be disdainful.  It makes no sense to turn cash into this DCC because you could just cut out the middle step and use straight cash! In the case of C) I would be perplexed.  Why in the world would you not just call it a coupon and be done with it?

If anyone can answer this(these) question(s)I would appreciate it, because now Im going to wonder about this for hours.

One last thing.  If the template for your currency is on your site, why would someone not just print out a bunch of it and redeem it? Users/MasonMurray

20090302 18:02:38 nbsp I found an interesting article on a town that did this in the UK:

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e0d6d3cc053611de8166000077b07658.html?nclick_check1

When I read this I had to think of Davis. It seems like a good idea for our town. I think town residents would be interested in empirical evidence that  this has a positive impact on real estate values.

In the pretty Sussex town of Lewes, 10 miles inland from the southern English coast, an interesting experiment is taking place.

At first glance, Lewes seems to be a picturepostcard of the past, with hilly streets and quirky shops, a cobbled humpbacked bridge, a Victorian brewery and a population prone to parading around in historical costumes as a celebration of centuriesold villains and martyrs. But behind the scenes the hometown of 18thcentury reformer Thomas Paine is living up to his tradition of social radicalism.

Two years ago Lewes joined a growing international movement of transition towns in countries as diverse as the US, Japan, Australia and Italy where residents believe that the best way to preserve the values of their communities and combat climate change is to favour local produce and business over the standardised offerings of the global economy. And, last September, it went one step further by introducing its own currency.

This is a less eccentric move than it seems. Precedents for alternative currency schemes in the modern world began to crop up as far back as the 1930s when two businessmen, Werner Zimmermann and Paul Enz, set up the WirtschaftsringGenossenschaft (WIR) scheme in Switzerland to provide credit to local small and mediumsized businesses in the midst of the Great Depression. No notes were ever issued but the system remains active today and serves as inspiration.

In the US there are now at least 12 local currency schemes, created not to overcome financial hardship  though that might prove a side benefit in the current economic climate  but to emphasise traditional smalltown American values and those linked with the contemporary transition town movement, with neighbours supporting one another against a hostile outside world.

The largest is the Berkshares programme, launched three years ago in the rural Berkshires region of southern Massachusetts. Issued in denominations of one to 50, at a 5 per cent discount to the dollar, and administered by a notforprofit company, the money is now widely accepted, even for large purchases and wage payments, with nearly $2m worth circulating among businesses and private individuals. According to Susan Witt, who sits on the board that oversees the scheme, it has also become a powerful social force. It reformed the way many Berkshires business owners and residents think about their local economy and helped educate the community on why shopping locally matters, she says. Our youth prefer to spend their free time on Main Street rather than at the mall. They experience and contribute to the vibrancy of our downtown.
