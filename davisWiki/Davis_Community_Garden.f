Commonly referred to by area residents as the hippie garden.  (Sometimes its pejorative, sometimes affectionate.  Depends on the tone.) The other major public garden in Davis is the Experimental College Garden. It appears that the citys open container ordinance does not apply to this park. There is a waiting list for renting plots here. Contact the coordinator at communitygardens@cityofdavis.org to be added to the waiting list.

For information on gardening and other gardens in Davis, see the gardening page.
