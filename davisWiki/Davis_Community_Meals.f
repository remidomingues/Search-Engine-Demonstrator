DCM welcomes seniors, lowincome and homeless individuals and families, and any other members of our community. The food for the meals is obtained from many sources; gleaned from local markets and grocery stores, donated by individuals, groups and businesses, received from other nonprofits and government agencies (including Yolo County Food Bank), or purchased. The food is prepared and served thanks to the efforts of individual community volunteers, religious organizations, school groups, community service groups, groups associated with UC Davis, and many others. For more info, call 5307564008.

The food is mediocre (rating4 on a 19 scale), but at least its nutritious. Its worth all that you pay for it. The volunteer servers place the food on your cafeteria tray, but you can choose not to have any item. Some of the items are vegetarian. For truly vegan (and tastier) food, theres Food Not Bombs, but they only serve on Sundays.

Volunteer Opportunities Volunteers are needed yearround for food preparation, cooking, serving, and cleanup. Other volunteer duties within the shelter/transitional housing program include evening (6pm10pm) and overnight (9pm8am) shelter monitors, with the greatest need during weekends  weekday help is typically needed in the Resource Center from 8amnoon. Different groups, usually church affiliated, serve each time.


20100217 03:33:01 nbsp They do excellent work, and actually provide people with the resources and assistance they need to get back on their feet. I should know. I consider myself one of the success stories of this group, having relied upon their shelters for more of the 90s than I care to admit. Still, with their help I was able to get a real life. If you want to make a real difference in peoples lives, this is the place to do it.  Users/Flynn

20100704 15:37:13 nbsp Just curious, why does the cold weather shelter allow eight men but only two women? Users/MeggoWaffle

20110707 13:50:45 nbsp Davis Community Meals on 1111 H st. does NOT have a computer room, does NOT assist in transportation services, and is NEVER open past 2:00pm. When mail does arrive it is held for 5 days before given to the intended receiver. They are, however, a place for people in need and provide laundry services(1 load) and showers(15 minute max.) The main problem is that the staff doesnt want to make a difference in peoples lives theyre there to get paid. Porsches, 2011 Civics, and a 2009 Expedition are what the staff choose to drive to work. The lady in the front office always has either a phone or a fork to her mouth so trying to talk to someone there is the first of many labors. Users/JustinYoder

20110818 11:03:31 nbsp They really need to do a better job at getting back to people who are interested in being volunteers. I emailed them months ago and never got a reply. I tried calling them a total of 3 times in total, and I get the volunteer coordinators voice mail every time. I really wanted to volunteer here, but it looks like its not going to work out! :( Users/ScottMeehleib
