  DCN ran a forum at http://forum.dcn.org for 3 weeks from Monday, June 21 through Sunday, July 11 in 2004 about The Davis City Councils Goals and Key Objectives for 20042006. For some reason the usernames and profiles are messed up with spam now, even though the posts are still there.
DCN is a taxexempt, nonprofit, 501(c)(3) charitable organization.  It relies in large part on public support.  If youd like to help it reach its fundraising goal of $20,000 for FY2006, please see http://www.dcn.org/dcn/rac/dcn_support.pdf this PDF or http://partners.guidestar.org/partners/networkforgood/gs_report.jsp?npoId409769 DCNs page at Network for Good.

DCN is not an ISP.  It has a contractual agreement with http://www.omsoft.com/ Omsoft Technologies to manage dialup subscribers, and to help manage DCNs Network Operations Center at 1623 5th Street 5th St.

DCN was the first offcampus ISP in Davis, beginning in 1994.   As commercial ISPs appeared, DCN arranged an ISP partnership relationship with Omsoft Technologies, which pays to DCN a small portion of subscriber income to support our main efforts. Users/RichardLowenberg Richard Lowenberg was the executive director from date to date.

Though supported by outside grants (principally from CalTrans and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) in its startup years, DCN has had partial, and now total local support since its inception. DCN is partnership based, and was begun with participation by UCD, the City of Davis and the DJUSD. It has a long running partnership with the Yolo Elections Office.
