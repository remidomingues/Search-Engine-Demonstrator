The Davis Community Workshop is a new community organizations community organization aiming to create a http://hackerspaces.org hackerspace in Davis.

Generally, the space would be an open community lab incorporating elements of a machine shop, workshop, and studio, where people can come together to share resources and knowledge to make things.

Specifically, what the space will have depends on the interest of those who get involved.  So please get involved!

Until there is a fullyfunctioning http://hackerspaces.org hackerspace in operation, here are places that you can get your hacker fix on right now:
  Bike Forth for working on your bike
  Craft Center for most of the stuff you might want to do in a hackerspace
  Technocultural Studies Building (formerly the Art Annex)  has a soldering/electronics lab. Technically youre supposed to be affiliated with UC Davis, but the Technocultural Studies Club can help you work in the lab if you can work when theyre there.
  The Domes workshop/shed  what are the rules for using it? What resources do they have?
  Bike Garage (students/faculty only)
  Not yet completed: The Inventors Workshop, created by Larry Fisher

 Initial meet up 

The first meet up happened on Wednesday, May 9, 7:30 pm at Bistro 33 at the outdoor patio.  It was a fairly informal affair to gauge interest and plan a more regular meeting time and place.  About 30 interested and interesting people came to talk of their backgrounds and projects and ideas for a space.
