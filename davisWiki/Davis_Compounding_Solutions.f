20100328 19:53:35 nbsp I didnt even know this place existed till a while ago, but I was very pleased with the services offered here! My vet told me my little rat needed some medicine for mites, but that the amount of medicine was too small to really prescribe, so she called these guys. They were communicative and respectful from the start  they called me not only to introduce themselves but to tell me that they were working on it, and again when they were done. The guy who worked there, Chuck, I think, even had a rat of his own and prepared the medicine in a very easy fashion to give to my rat. I was a little worried that Id have to force my little rat to take it, but he loved it! Chuck even gave me some advice on how to administer it and offered to answer any questions if they arose. I was very satisfied! Users/Adalwolf
