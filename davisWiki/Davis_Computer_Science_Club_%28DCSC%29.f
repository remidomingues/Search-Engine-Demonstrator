CS Club built the Computer Science and Engineering section of the Engineering departments picnic day float many years ago. It consisted of a paperclip and a penguin inside a small boxing ring, a wacky joke regarding the Microsoft/Linux rivalry. The clubs picnic day efforts also used to included a Street Smarts game show (whatever that was), but nowadays cool projects are shown off. In Picnic day 2011 for example, the popular iPhone app UCD Mobile was shown off.



I agree with ct here, but would hate to get a ChrisMcKenzie vs. Computer Science Club going, because that sounds like an awful waste of my time.  And shame on you for putting cts comment under editorial review. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

20060501 19:18:31 nbsp Would I be correct in saying that current students may need to get over the past? CS Clubs can be quite beneficial, and I am aware with the difficulty in managing one. Users/JustinCummins
