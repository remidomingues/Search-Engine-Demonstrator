In addition, throughout Constitution week, other events are taking place in Davis to recognize the Constitution’s signing.

The evening of Tuesday, September 10 from 6:30 to 7:30 at The Avid Reader, there will be a discussion of the newly released title, The Roberts Court by Marcia Coyle. Subtitled The Struggle for the Constitution, this book covers four landmark decisions concerning health care, money in elections, guns at home, and race in schools and captures how those cases began and how they ultimately exposed the great divides among the justices.

Author Marcia Coyle is the chief Washington correspondent for The National Law Journal and has covered the Supreme Court for twentyfive years.

Journalist Bob Woodward has referred to The Roberts Court as “one of the best Supreme Court books in years.” Former Solicitor General of the United States, Kenneth W. Starr, terms the book “a wonderful addition to the literature about the Court.”

The Avid Reader is offering The Roberts Court at 30% discount.

Leading the discussion of the book at The Avid Reader will be Stan Forbes. Chair of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, Forbes served on the Davis School Board from 1987 to 1996 and as a member of the Davis City Council from 1996 to 2000. He is the owner of The Avid Reader at The Tower.

Wednesday, September 11 and Saturday, September 14, there will be a table during the hours of the Farmers Market hosted by representatives from the group “We the People of Davis.” They will be holding a Facts Contest centered on the Constitution inviting Farmers Market attendees young and older alike to spin the wheel and to answer easy and more difficult questions on this country’s founding document.

Finally, McGeorge Professor of Law John Cary Sims will be speaking at The Avid Reader during Constitution Week on the subject of the 4th Amendment Thursday, September 12 at 7:30. As attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a public interest law firm in Washington, D.C. founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Professor Sims handled a wide range of complex cases at all levels of the state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States.
