The Davis Cooperative Community Fund (DCCF) was created with initial and ongoing contributions from the Davis Food Coop (DFC) and the Twin Pines Cooperative Foundation (TPCF), as well as from local Davis community members.

The DCCF is one of 21 Cooperative Community Funds operating throughout the USA as a local giving arm of the host food coop. All of the CCFs are sponsored by the Twin Pines Cooperative Foundation. Each of the CCFs act as endowments.

As of 2007, the DCCF has over $73,000 in its fund. The interest earned on the endowment is made available to the DCCF to donate to local nonprofit and cooperatives.

In Spring each year, a committee appointed by the Davis Food Coop reviews applications and makes awards.

You can help the Community Fund grow!

DCCF is funded by local dollars from donations from Davis community members. The money is invested in socially responsible funds, and the interest is given back to the community through annual grants to community groups.

DCCF has been giving small, meaningful grants to local organizations since 1999 (see below for complete list). Grants are available to even very small groups, and the application is easy enough that even allvolunteer groups can submit successful applications.

Members of the community are encouraged to make tax deductible donations to the DCCF. Some years, the Davis Food Cop matches the donation made to the Community Fund up to $5,000.


 More information 
Go to both http://davisfood.coop/sustainability/communityfund and http://www.community.coop for further information about the local DCCF or other Cooperative Community Funds in other cities.

The endowment of almost 2 million dollars held in the Twin Pines Cooperative Foundation is almost 100% invested in cooperative development organizations, cooperative banks, credit unions, Organic Valley and Equal Exchange.
