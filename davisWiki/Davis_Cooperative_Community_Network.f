Who we are
We are a group of people interested in communal living. We aim to share tools, projects, and ideas with other cooperatives cooperativeminded folks.


Getting involved
We meet monthly; the exact time and place varies. Join the the http://groups.google.com/group/dccnetwork DCCN mailing list here to find out about meeting time/place, and to join the discussion about cooperative communities.

Start Cooperative Housing workshops
DCCN hosts Start Cooperative Housing workshops to help people create cooperative households. The demand for living in cooperative communities is much larger than the supply, so DCCN wants to help seed new cooperative households.

DCCN also contributes to the How to live in a cooperative page. (Add to it if you have suggestions or wisdom of your own!)

Shared Applicant Pool
DCCN maintains a https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkeydFZibnZBb3BwSUszaXFIOXRxcjVZdlE6MQ&ifq shared applicant pool for people interested in applying to a cooperative community, so they may be contacted by any cooperative community with openings.

If you live in a cooperative community and want to contact prospective new community members, contact Nick Barry, of N Street Cohousing: (530) 213 3312, or contact him here: http://www.nicholasbarry.com/about.html

Coop and Cohousing Conference
In July 2010 the Davis Cooperative Community Fund awarded DCCN with a grant to support a local coop and cohousing conference. The California Center for Cooperative Development is acting as fiscal sponsor.

History
DCCN was formed in fall 2009 by the members of several cohousing and housing cooperatives in Davis. The vision for the network was born out of ongoing discussions between members of the California Center for Cooperative Development, Dos Pinos Cooperative, the Solar Community Housing Association, Pacifico Student Coop, the Domes & TriCooperatives on the UC campus, and N Street Cohousing in Davis, California.  Our goal is to unite local cooperative housing organizations to strengthen our community through the sharing of ideas, program models, and material resources. Our first event was held on Sunday, April 18th at the common house of N Street Cohousing.
