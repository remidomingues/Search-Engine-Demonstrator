The Davis Creamery is an ice cream parlor.  Until early 2011, it was located at Oakshade Town Center, a few doors down from Dos Coyotes. That location used to be a Marble Slab Creamery. The Davis Creamery now resides inside of Sugar Daddies in downtown.

Former News Headlines for Davis Creamery lovers, from Wendy Weitzels Comings and Goings column in the Enterprise:

 Davis Creamery, also home to Cupcake Craving and Cookie Connection, is moving from South Davis to downtown, effective in May. The owner has leased a space at 113 E St., in The Lofts, last occupied by Yogurt Shack.

 It will serve ice cream, cookies and cupcakes. Once it moves, plans are to be open seven days a week, from 11 a.m. until 2 a.m., according to a news release from Davis Commercial Properties, which handled the lease.

Regular ice cream flavors included chocolate, blueberry, vanilla brown sugar, peanut butter, salted caramel, chai tea, chocolate mint, banana, and honey.  They also offered also seasonal flavors, such as pumpkin and egg nog.  In December 2007, liver and onions was listed as a flavor, although it was conspicuously absent from the display case.  Mixins could be added to the basic flavors, with the mixing being done on the nowcommon cold slab.

The Davis Creamery made its own ice cream in the shop, and handmade cookies and cupcakes are also available.  Their motto is Udderly Delicious, and their logo features a cows cow riding a bicycles bicycle.


As of February 2009, they also offered cupcakes from http://www.cupcakecraving.com Cupcake Craving. There were a wide variety of cupcake flavors such as Bavarian Dream, Monkey Mania, Caramel Comfort, Raspberry Reward just to name a few. Different combo deals for ice cream and cupcakes are available like the single combo which is $5 for any cupcake and a scoop of ice cream. Starting in July 2009, the Davis Creamery began carrying cookies from http://www.cookieconnection.com Cookie Connection out of Sacramento, which are also wiki:woodland:The Cookie Company cookies from Woodland. They now offer about 24 different varieties of gourmet cookies, and the cowpies (ice cream sandwiches) are available both premade with these cookies and kept frozen, or made to order to fit to your specific tastes.

They have also been spotted at the Farmers Market Farmers Market, serving up some of their specialty flavors, such as avocado coconut, honey vanilla, peach brown sugar, lemon basil, and many more. The farmers market flavors are made from fresh ingredients purchased from local farmers, so the flavors vary based on what is available for purchase at the market. These flavors are available in the store, but only upon request as they are kept in the back for the market.

They want you to join the http://www.thedaviscreamery.com Davis Creamery online or follow their http://www.daviscreamery.blogspot.com/ blog, http://twitter.com/daviscreamery Twitter, and http://www.facebook.com/pages/DavisCA/DavisCreamery/22741963831 Facebook to hear about the newest flavors, biggest deals, and special sales.

Stacy Daniels took over the Davis Creamery from David Robert (former owner of the Marble Slab Creamery in this location) on May 1, 2010.

  Gotta love ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!




20071223 18:45:15 nbsp You can tell youre getting the real stuff here.  For example, the chocolate peanut butter ice cream has chunks of peanuts in it, and the banana ice cream  a flavor I dont normally like  actually tastes like bananas.  There isnt a huge supply of mixins, but they have the standard ones; dont overlook the homemade brownies off to the side.  Now I just need to save up some calories for a Cow Pie. Users/CovertProfessor

20080127 16:03:08 nbsp Ive tried their Cow Pie. The Vanilla ice cream was delicious and had good flavor and consistency (not too hard, not too soft). However, the Cow Pie was more than I could handle because I wasnt able to finish the second cookie! I do wish they would make their cookies chewy, instead of crunchy, so that it would be easier to eat along with the ice cream. I am looking forward to going back and trying their other flavors. Users/at86

20080201 10:49:55 nbsp how are the vegan options here? mixed berry sorbet sounds cool... Users/PxlAted

20080306 22:50:12 nbsp Saw a coupon in the California Aggie for $1 off... also saw that students get a 10% discount with ID? I guess it wouldnt hurt to ask! Users/at86

20080313 16:46:59 nbsp The Cupcake ice cream was great, but the blueberries were bad.  It was obvious they were frozen, not fresh, and were hard in the center.  Im also not a big fan of frozen strawberries in syrup which they had in lieu of fresh strawberries.  Next time Ill pass on the fruit toppings.  Users/GraceAn

20080318 15:34:09 nbsp Had just cones today, a chocolate and a raspberry.  Nothing totally unique but nearby and good quality.  Will be back for sure and likely going to give the Cow pie a try. Users/loneshark

20080326 17:52:08 nbsp Have to say this place has the best ice cream hands down. In response to at86, Ive heard that theyve changed their cookie making processes and it shows. Every time Ive had one, the cookies have been perfect. I recommend the cowpie to absolutely everyone! Oh... and be sure to ask for the chocolate chip peanut butter cookies, best kept secret of the store!    Users/blitzcatt

20080428 18:11:12 nbsp They had great customer service and fantastic ice cream! Love the Chocolate Peanut Butter! Definitely recommend it for summer time blues  Users/LizDarko

20080501 10:58:20 nbsp I had a good experience with Davis Creamery a couple months ago: good ice cream and good service. Then I went there with friends yesterday and was very disappointed at the service. Even though we had a coupon that explicitly said $1 from the Aggie with no fine print on it, they wouldnt let us use it on single and junior scoop, frozen yogurt (basically everything we wanted to get!). I dont know why they would put a coupon in the newspaper if theyre just going to add in all these stipulations last minute. Its a shame because theyre ice cream is pretty good quality. Well, they lost our business that day and Im sure we wont be going back very soon in the future either.  Users/AmberHMa

20080504 19:27:41 nbsp Best ice cream in Davis without a doubt.  Ice cream is by far my favorite food (how could anything else possibly be better!!) and after my first taste of DC ice cream I was hooked.  Try it yourself just once, like CovertProfessor said, you will instantly be able to tell you are getting the real stuff.  The ice cream here is supposedly made in Davis and they have a huge selection of things to order.  You can get Froyo (the natural kind), ice cream + mixins, Cow Pies (ice cream sandwiched between two cookies), milkshakes, and other menu items I neglect because I always get vanilla ice cream + strawberry/raspberry ice cream + strawberry toppings.  Try the milkshakes though they are excellent!  Their milkshakes have that heavy ice cream flavor and yummy ice cream chunks you might be familiar with if youve tried some milkshakes from upscale restaurants.  Another thing I like about Davis Creamery is that it has some interesting flavors... for example yesterday they had blueberry flavored ice cream.  Never seen that flavor before and it was a nice rich purple color.  Cool.
I made this daviswiki account just so I could comment on Davis Creamery.  Yes, I know it is a bit sad.  Cold Stone just closed down and I hope my beloved Davis Creamery doesnt follow the same fate.
Oh yea by the way, Davis Creamery has very reasonable prices.  3.95 for two ice creams and a mixin (thats without coupons/student id also) and every time I go my cup is overflowing from the top.  Cant give this place a better recommendation.  Go out there and try it, guys!

P.S. About GraceAns comments on DCs use of frozen strawberries as toppings  I agree.  The frozen toppings are no dice and my only gripe about Davis Creamery.  They taste alright on the outside but the inside of the fruit is still frozen and it doesnt go too well with the ice cream.  Whats up with that, DC!   Users/DavidLiu



Hi Guys!
Thank you for taking the time to provide comments and feedback about DC.  Were glad to see many of you enjoying our ice cream. We feel weve got the best stuff in town! :D
We also appreciate your patience as we continue to figure some things out, like balancing fresh fruit vs. frozen fruit and training our team members to provide consistent and excellent customer service every single time.
CP Thanks for getting the ball rolling!
at86 & PixlAted  We were playing around with our cookie recipe when we opened, (you wouldnt believe how challenging it was to find a quality cookie that could be baked consistently by whomever was working that day), I think weve found the right one now!
The only vegan or nondairy option we have at the moment is the mixedberry sorbet.  Give it a try with a granola mixin... I think youll enjoy it.
GraceAn I totally agree with you on the fresh vs. frozen strawberries. Were committed to fresh strawberries as the choice for our topping since we believe our ice cream deserves it. We dont want to blow it for the sake of convenience with frozen berries.
blitzcatt, LizDarko  Thanks for the great comments!
AmberHMa Im glad that we managed to not disappoint you with our ice cream!  We appreciate your feedback and hope youll give us another shot. Weve had a chat with our team members about honoring our coupons and have worked on revising our Ads to make them clear and enticing.  How about you come by and try out Spicy Chai Tea flavor?
DavidLiu  Thanks for the great enthusiasm!  If we can make everyone feel the way you do, well be sticking around for a long time to come.
Were committed to keep on trying our best and bringing you locally produced, innovative ice cream flavors that are delicious!  Check us out on FB and join the DC Fan Club!

20080611 22:19:54 nbsp I LOVE DAVIS CREAMERY! Users/davisrox

20080703 20:44:40 nbsp I just had the Spicy Chai Tea ice cream and it is excellent!  The other flavors are all great too, but the Chai is perfect.  Every time Ive been into DC, the customer service has been great too! Users/RMC

20080809 20:38:38 nbsp Service and ice cream were great. Cookie was still a little crisp, though not enough to deter my next first. Great place. Will be back. Users/Sar58

20080904 18:07:55 nbsp Its listed for sale on craigslist. Users/BradBenedict

20090201 16:23:06 nbsp Went by today during business hours, and it was closed. Is this place still in business? Users/jsg718
  I read in the Enterprise that they were closing temporarily for the winter, but that they would be reopening very soon with a slightly more focused business.  I think they really want to emphasize their specialty flavors, which makes me very, very happy.  Their blueberry ice cream is out of this world  keep in mind that this remark comes from someone who usually doesnt bother with dessert that isnt chocolate.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090211 15:26:40 nbsp are they opening a cupcake place in this spot? Users/Yesenia
  I read that the Creamery will offer cupcakes in addition to the ice cream.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090211 20:14:17 nbsp They have reopened and showcase off a nice variety of the cupcakes by Cupcakes Cravings.  All looked incredibly yummy and it was hard to make a choice.  Ended up with a Koo Koo for Macaroons and a Dulce de leche and they were both really good.  The Dulce was super yummy with very silky frosting.  You can see the cupcake flavors at http://www.cupcakecraving.com.  Nice edition to the Creamery and a very satisfying desert option. Users/loneshark

20090212 17:19:15 nbsp The ice cream is great, but a bit pricey. Now, for 1 scoop and a mixin, my total came out to $4.04!!! The red velvet cupcake isnt very good, either. The banana ice cream is amazing.  Users/TY3

20090214 17:21:09 nbsp DAVIS CREAMERY IS NOW REOPENED!

We closed the store for a few weeks for renovation, and to bring in our new partner, Cupcake Cravings. They are a privately owned and operated business out of Sacramento, and we are pleased to have their handmade and handdecorated cupcakes to offer along with our ice cream. The ice cream is the same and prepared fresh here in the shop, with a few new flavor offerings, such as the salted caramel and 100% organic flavors. We have changed sizing and pricing to hopefully make it simpler for both our customers and ourselves, and are open to any feedback. The prices have raised on both the banana and honey ice cream, since they are now 100% organic, but we have simplified everything to make it a better experience overall for every customer that walks through our door.

Thanks to all of you for your comments, keep them coming! We rely on feedback to continue changing and improving to offer you the best service and experience possible every time. Be sure to come and check out everything new we have to offer you, we feel that both our continued products and our new additions are delicious and we will do everything possible to make sure you are not disappointed!    Users/hjermstad

20090221 13:39:54 nbsp What are the hours? Im about to go bike all they way over there to check it out but I dont know if its open. Users/KellyM

20090221 22:39:02 nbsp Theyre open until 11 PM on Saturday Users/OrofinJackson

20090314 15:58:32 nbsp Had to post after I just had an incredibly disappointing experience with this place... Went in wanting a cowpie and first off the cookies they used were out of a plastic package (like the big stale inedible ones you buy at Safeway near the bakery section).  Maybe Im imagining this but in my memory these cowpies used to be made with fresh baked cookies and Im pretty sure the cookies were warmed up or something when I got my cowpie.  So this kid sticks these sick cookies into a cup after informing me they only have chocolate chip, then puts literally the smallest scoop of ice cream Ive ever gotten in between them.  I was too stunned to even say anything... I will say the person I was with got about 2.5 times as much ice cream I did, so either the scooper hated me or was just being really lazy.  I cant believe I just paid $3.50 for a thimbleful of vanilla ice cream and cookies that I wouldnt even feed to a pigeon.  :(  I will definitely never return to this place.   Users/soledad101

20090318 11:52:26 nbsp really cute locally owned place.  love that they make their ice cream instore.  pints and quarts are a little pricey, and some of the cupcakes dont really taste like a huge step up from safeway cupcakes that you could get across the parking lot, but some of them are awesome.  bavarian cream and red velvet rock!  they have giant snickerdoodle cookies that are REALLY good here... soft and chewy.  the ice cream is great too.  its so hard to pick because they all taste so good. theres cute little asian girl that works there knows her stuff and has really good recommendations when you dont know what to pick.  service was great.  some asshole in front of us was giving her a really hard time but the whole situation was handled really professionally and i was actually surprised. usually places like this have barelyoldenough punks who look like theyd rather be somewhere else. Users/houndstooth
   Out of curiosity, how can you give somebody a hard time over ice cream? jw

20090325 22:09:17 nbsp I finally made it back to check out this place after the reopening.  Some comments, in no particular order, partly in response to comments above:  We also had the experience of very different portion sizes for the same price, from the same server, one which was very small and one which was reasonable (for the price).  Very odd.  The cookies we saw were definitely homemade; perhaps they run out occasionally?  I am consistently drawn to their fruitflavored ice cream, in spite of the fact that I dont generally like fruitflavored ice cream.  It is that good.  (I think I had raspberry this time).  We split a cupcake, and it was yummy  they have some sort of one scoop/one cupcake deal (sorry, I dont remember the details).  Last but not least:  Please bring back brownie as a mixin option!!   Users/CovertProfessor

20090328 17:12:37 nbsp third time to try cupcakes and my partner and I were both very bummed that the cake wasnt moist and seemed a bit stale or air exposed.  Case full of great options but doesnt mean much if they arent really fresh.  Made my own brownies today. Users/loneshark

20090425 17:22:48 nbsp Always been very pleased with the ice cream/milk shakes!  Since the remodel, the wait is much shorter when theres a line and the addition of cupcakes is great (although some of the flavors are more consistent in quality than others).  I highly recommend it! Users/cfb

20090519 08:08:08 nbsp Bought a few cupcakes here for the first time last week.  Very disappointing, very cheap Safewaylike taste, especially the frosting.  The cake didnt taste much like chocolate, either.  I couldnt even finish my chocolate cupcakea first ever for me.  Try the cupcakes at the Nugget in North Davis instead. Users/LeslieMadsenBrooks

20090601 14:56:49 nbsp I love this place, and the staff is so friendly. Now that the weather is getting hotter I know Ill be trying more of their flavors.  Users/nkristis

20090601 22:53:41 nbsp YAY for dollar Mondays! I went there tonight for the first time, and got a scoop of peanut butter icecream mixed with chocolate ice cream. They were both delicious, and I finished my meal wanting more. My friend had the pomegranate raspberry and enjoyed it. Im going to try to chai next time I go in.

And their cupcakes looks absolutely divine, but I havent tried them yet. My friend said they looked better than they tasted, but Ill let you know when I try one myself.
 Users/BrookeB

20090706 20:26:35 nbsp I love Davis Creamery!!! They have unique flavors and I love how its so creamy... most of all, Im so thankful for dollar scoop Mondays! For once I have a reason to not hate Mondays! Users/JanetHung

20090831 16:11:29 nbsp Best ice cream in Davis. Especially their blueberry, raspberry and banana is extremely good.
 Users/Amanda09

20090914 15:19:27 nbsp Weekly specials are the best  find myself there on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. See above for the specials. Users/DerrickUm

20090917 01:57:26 nbsp I went here on Monday and it was really good. I plan to come back next Monday, and maybe get a cupcake. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 Im with Nick. The sorbet I tried (mango) was awesome. For a buck a scoop, you really cant go wrong. ) wl

20090918 19:16:32 nbsp Theyve killed Marble Slab!  We will never be going here again. $4.75 for a Dixie cup full of ice cream (and they call that two scoops?) with one mixin.  They were out of the mixin my wife wanted and also out of waffle cones (how does an ice cream place run out of cones?)  I miss Marble Slab.  Users/Chuckles

20091017 21:27:08 nbsp I have an idea for you: Ice cream cupcakes. They would be more gourmet than cake cupcakes, could be sold for a reasonable price, etc. Users/SteveDavison

20091111 11:21:44 nbsp I love this place. It is wellpriced, the customer service is always great, and their hours are convenient. They often have a couple of unique and interesting flavors of ice cream that I try when I am feeling adventurous. Yay for a local business! Users/GJC02

20091111 20:57:12 nbsp I absolutely love the ice cream and cupcakes, etc. Such a pleasant staff and really local feel. The daily specials are fantastic. I love the ice cream sandwich, especially with oatmeal raisin cookies. Also, I like the music they play. I will keep coming back. Users/GarySaylin

20091118 23:00:58 nbsp The ice cream was really really good.  The texture is appealing and consistent while the ice cream flavors are true; very bright and intense without any hints of manufactured chemicals.  If you like pumpkin ice cream, Davis Creamerys version is sublime.   Users/ZachStednick

20091229 13:39:04 nbsp I dont often go to South Davis, but this place is worth the trip! The salted caramel ice cream is amazing! Users/EmilyHughes

20100120 12:00:28 nbsp I love this place. The daily deals are amazing. The cupcakes are super tasty and the ice cream is delicious. I had a cowpie last night and it was good, but i recommend going early so you can get a fresh cookie. They had run out of them, so we picked from the dayold cookies. Even then it was tasty. I think everything here is good and for the most part, the staff has been friendly and helpful. Ill definitely be back for the deals.  Users/emmaleanne

20100128 17:50:28 nbsp My favorite ice cream in town and the best peppermint ice cream Ive ever had!  Also love the cowpies and their nightly deals, however, the cupcakes leave something to be desired... Users/5thAve

20100203 14:42:21 nbsp Recently tried Davis Creamery for myself  I love it! Ive gone twice in the last 2 weeks. The employees are really nice and helpful, which is great especially because I have a terrible time deciding which flavors I want to try. The cupcakes are alright, but something about them seems a little off to me. Really love the daily specials! Users/AliceW

20100205 14:56:06 nbsp The ice cream here is very, very good.  It has a smooth creamy homemade texture.  The vanilla brown sugar is a nice unique twist on a classic flavor.  The cookies are also real good.  I dont care much for the cupcakes but I dont like cake much at all.  The caramelo cookies and smores cookies are awesome.  The best cowpies are the caramelo with the vanilla brown sugar.  The best deal is by far Tuesday night $2 cowpies it is such a great price for the quality that you get.  I often feel guilty only paying $2 for those things. As of June 2010 Tuesday deal is $2.50 cowpies, still a great bargain. Users/DagonJones

20100222 16:07:56 nbsp The ice cream is very good, and homemade. The yogurt is also very good. With this said it is very expensive.  Users/GiulianaWasHere

  Also, their new Pineapple Blast is awesome! Users/TheShah SS
  20100818 00:23 Had a cow pie today, went up to $3. I had a macadamia nut cookie and chocolate chip/M&M cookie, and they werent that great. Ill stick to the ice cream and cupcakes, I guess. SS

20100819 14:37:18 nbsp Ive had their avocado coconut ice cream at the farmers market and it is delicious.  This is my favorite place for ice cream in Davis.  I went into the shop today and sampled the bubblegum and salted caramel flavors, and they were both tasty.  I got a sugarfree chocolate cupcake and it was very meh, but my guess is the regular cupcakes will better, so Ill be back another time to try one of those.  Service was friendly and polite. Users/DanaSullivan

20110331 15:49:01 nbsp Drove by this morning and the place is GONE!  Sign has been removed and the store has been cleared out.  The ice cream was good the cupcakes not so much.   Users/loneshark
  As noted above, they were supposed to move to 113 E St. in The Lofts in May, so maybe theyre not really gone.   Users/CovertProfessor
