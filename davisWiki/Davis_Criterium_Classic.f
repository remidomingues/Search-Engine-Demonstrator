A wiki:wikipedia:Criterium criterium, known among racers as a crit, is the Bicycling bicycling equivalent of the Indy 500: fast, exciting, and somewhat dangerous to contestants and spectators. The race course is a very short, tight closed circuit track around Downtown downtown Streets streets and sometimes even around a single building such as a Spiritual Organizations church.  Racers can travel at speeds exceeding 30 mph. Crits are popular because of the speed, danger, and technical skill required to make tight, high speed turns and position shifts within a pack.

The Davis Criterium Classic, sponsored by the Davis Bike Club (http://davisbikeclub.org/ website), is always held on the 4th of July in Downtown downtown Davis. The course is a 0.7mile Lshaped loop in downtown Davis, a flat course on moderate pavement with five 90degree left turns and one 90degree right turn.  This single right turn increases the technical difficulty of the course.
