About the Davis Cruisers

The Davis Cruisers are a bicycling group who ride for pleasure to sweet tunes, at a cruising pace, in a nonconfrontational style to celebrate celestial events, the arts, bicycle liberation, and anything else they feel like celebrating. The rides are public and free.

If you are interested in projecting music, please contact me at daviscruisers@gmail.com so that we can coordinate sound systems.

Previous Rides

The Full Moon Ride took place on August 16th under the luminous glory of the full moon, which was celebrated as the Sturgeon, Harvest, and Grain moon by indigenous people because of the plentiful nature of this time of year. Many thank yous to all Cruisers for coming out in full force! We cruised north along the green belt and then west, to the Domes and back downtown for the the Playa Party where Mark Chang magically crafted a man and temple for a proper burn in our mini playa. Thanks and praises!

The Inaugural Davis Cruisers New Moon Ride took place on August 1st. Thank you to all who came along for the cruise we enjoyed a musical ride through downtown Davis up to Northstar Park on the green belt. As the sun was setting, we headed over to the N Street Cohousing to enjoy an evening of local music by Nancy Cassidy.
