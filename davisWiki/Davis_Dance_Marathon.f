Everything we do, we do it For The Kids!

Dance Marathon is a nationwide movement, activating college students at more than 150 campuses across the country to raise money for the Childrens Miracle Network hospital in their community. Each dollar UC Davis students raise will go to the UC Davis Childrens hospital, to fund a variety of programs benefitting children at the hospital. The fundraising culminates with a 8 hour long event to celebrate the total amount of funds raised, throw a party for the kids treated by the hospital, and introduce the cause to a new generation of college students.

Join us and be part of the Miracle.

First ever, campus wide, philanthropy For The Kids, coming to UC Davis on January 12th, 2013!
