Davis Dance Project is an annual lecture and demonstration about some aspect of dance created and performed by the Pamela Trokanski Dance Theatre.  This event usually happens in the first part of February and is held at the InHouse Theater at the Pamela Trokanski Dance Workshop and Performing Arts Center.  The topic of the lecture/demonstration varies from year to year.  The format of the lecture is designed to be engaging for the audience.  As the lecturer tells the audience about a concept, dancers demonstrate it on stage.  The effect is similar to watching a filmed documentary, but the show is live.  Depending on the topic being discussed, audience members are invited on stage at various points in the show to experience and try skills and concepts with the help of trained dancers.  In some shows, the audience discusses and designs a dance which is performed on the spot by the dancers.  The dancers use the directives of the audience and improvisation techniques to create a new dance right before the audiences eyes.
