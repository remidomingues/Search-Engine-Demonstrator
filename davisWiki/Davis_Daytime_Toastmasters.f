The Davis Daytime Toastmasters Community Organizations club is a safe environment for you to become the Public Speaking speaker and leader you want to be.  As of September 2013, we are a mix of beginning and intermediate Toastmasters, with about 8 to 10 members in attendance each week.

The Davis Daytime Toastmasters club is part of http://www.toastmasters.org/ Toastmasters International, a NonProfit Organizations 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. Through club activities and conferences, Toastmasters helps its members improve their communication and leadership skills while fostering selfconfidence and personal growth.

The Daytimers club was chartered by http://www.westyost.com/ West Yost Associates, a local water resources engineering firm, as a training tool for the employees to improve their communication and better themselves.  As such, the meetings are held at the West Yost office.  However, we are a public club, and more than half of our members are from the community at large.  All are welcome to visit and check us out!

The Daytimers would like to thank the Davis Toastmasters Town and Gown Toastmasters for all their help in getting started as a club.  The Town and Gown meets on Tuesday evenings.

Here are some photos of the building we meet in:
