20120210 18:39:56 nbsp I had my very first consultation with Dr. Noll today, it was a very pleasant experience.  I was a bit nervous but Dr. Noll made me feel very comfortable, almost as if I was talking to a very good friend.  She explained the procedures in a way that was easy for me to understand and she made me feel very safe in choosing her for my procedure.  I would strongly recommend her for any dermatological procedure.  Her staff was also very friendly and helpful.   Users/KimiEVS

20120307 22:58:49 nbsp I have not been to Davis Dermatology but I did see Dr. Noll in October 2011 through the UCDMC Dept. of Dermatology. I waited over an hour to see her. She was in the exam room with me for less than five minutes. I had a couple of skin issues at the time and her way of addressing the main issue was to tell me to continue taking a certain medication for 68 weeks then come in for a follow up to see if it helped. Well I was not on said medication and had to tell her this. I guess she didnt have time to actually read my medical record. She stood at a distance the whole time and didnt even examine my skin! Instead, she just wanted me to start this medication. Before I could bring up the second issue, she said shed be right back an information sheet for me. She never came back and instead sent in a physicians assistant. I asked him if Dr. Noll was going to return and he replied with something to the effect of no, shes really behind but Im sure she can answer the rest of your questions at your recheck appointment in 68 weeks. What a complete and utter waste of my time and money. I was so furious that I wrote a letter of complaint to the dermatology department. Users/EmmyMelton

20120406 13:32:51 nbsp I saw Dr. Noll at Davis Dermatology in March and was extremely pleased with my whole experience.  She was professional, kind and very attentive to my concerns. She was very knowledgeable about the various procedures I inquired about and was very patient with me  and I had a lot of questions!  I ended up getting filler and botox and am very pleased with the results.  I am so happy to have her here in Davis and highly recommend her!  Kathryn79

20120509 15:53:01 nbsp Thank you Dr. Noll! I saw Dr. Noll several weeks ago for rash that was covering over 50% of my body.  I had seen several other dermatologists and they didnt know what was wrong with me.  I was frustrated after trying and failing several medicines.  One of my friends then recommended that I see Dr. Noll, and I am so glad that I did.  She was able to accurately diagnose me, started me on the right treatment and my skin is finally starting to clear.  I am just so pleased and appreciative of her help, I cant thank her enough.

20120710 16:47:33 nbsp Was a little hesitant to visit a dermatologist based on a daviswiki recommendation, but it has worked out for me for finding other great services so why not a dermatologist. I checked out her website to see what services she offers, and read a little background. I just had my first appointment today and I have to say what a great experience. Her staff is extremely professional, courteous, and knowledgable. I have had my share of going to offices where people dont really like their job, but they all seemed to enjoy their work environment, and were pretty awesome. Dr. Noll took the time to listen to my concerns and gave her recommendations. I felt comfortable enough that I went ahead and got two moles on my scalp, that have constantly bugged me for years removed today. It was virtually painless even on the financial end. Their costs for students, which are budget conscious, and dont have alot of money, were more than reasonable, even including a student discount! Yeah! I highly recommend her for any of your skin care issues or needs, they are very respectful as well, and busy. I was lucky to get in since somebody cancelled, but they were booked all week for a month. It makes me feel better when a place is busy because you know that others love her services as well, and they wouldnt return if it were not worth it. I even talked to a woman there that had fillers placed around her mouth and I dont know what else she had done but I have to say she looked fairly young, with little to no wrinkles. The clinic was clean, modern, and nice. I am definitely going back for my follow up, and any future needs.  Users/MichelleRx7

20121002 20:34:01 nbsp After multiple failed attempts to reach a dermatologist from Kaiser, I contacted Dr. Noll even though her services are not covered by my insurance. She was so motherly, kind, and helpful! She knew I was a broke student, (and an uninsured student too) and tried her best to help me get the skin care I desired at the most affordable cost. She and her staff are extremely warm and welcoming they even greeted me by name the second time I stopped by and made me feel very at home. I definitely recommend Dr. Noll to all! Yes, even you fellow poor college students! Users/gpark
