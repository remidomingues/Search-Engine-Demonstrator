JOIN OUR WEEKLY MEDITATION & PUJA

Our Sangha gathers weekly on Monday and Tuesday evenings at 7 pm for puja. On Monday, the puja follows the Practice Book of Lama Gursam Rinpoche of the Bodhicitta Foundation http://www.lamagursam.org/index.html, followed by our Dharma Reading and Discussion Group. On Tuesday, the puja follows the Practice as taught by Anam Thubten Rinpoche of the Dharmata Foundation http://www.dharmatafoundation.com/, and  is followed by listening together to a recorded teaching. We meet at A Shared Awareness, The Lofts, 105 E Street #3G, Davis, CA, and begin promptly at 7 pm. Please join us!

Street Parking in the downtown area is generally available and free on week nights.  Other than street parking you may try the parking structure above the movie theaters on E Street between 1st Street First & 2nd Street Second Streets, or the parking lot behind Whole Foods Market on the south side of First Street between D & E Streets.
