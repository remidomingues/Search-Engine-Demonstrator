20101110 00:05:00 nbsp This place was a MAJOR disappointment!!! I have 2 year old twin boys, and they could not even be bothered learning their names. They repeatedly referred to one of my little boys as that one. They also referred to my husband as either the father or by the wrong name. They run their business as a business. They are completely about the bottom line. They do not care about children. The facility is dirty. The lack of supervision is very unsafe ,and the amount of teaching that my children received from the teacher was minimal. In addition, the owner refused to call me to discuss my concerns. As a local pediatrician and as a mother I highly recommend looking elsewhere. Users/JacquelineEvans

20110915 11:07:04 nbsp My 2 daughters love going to Davis Diamonds.  Id guess theyve been at it for 4 and 5 years now, so we know the facility, the people and the procedures.  They have regular classes, demonstrations, parents night out, and obviously competitive programs.  I like the coaches, including the owners who are deeply involved in their business.  The building itself is not fantastic (and theyve been looking into moving to another facility) but it doesnt bother the kids at all.  My girls always love going to gymnastics and it is nice having a place in Davis they can go easily after school. Users/kihyoplee

20121205 13:05:48 nbsp I have a great time taking my twoyearold daughter here, and she has a great time as well. The coaches seem to really care that the kids get something from the time they spend there. To be honest, the facility is not exactly stateoftheart, and appears a little dirty. However, they are currently in the process of moving to a new one in South Davis they tell me, which will be much better at meeting the expectations of Davis residents. Users/BrianPakpour
