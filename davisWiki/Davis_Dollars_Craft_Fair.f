Davis Dollars Craft Fair is an event bringing together a variety of craft vendors and activities for all ages.

The Davis Dollars Craft Fair encourages local spending with Davis own community currency.  There are DIY crafting activities available for all ages, and a multitude of unique and interesting crafts from a diverse set of vendors.  You can enjoy a funfilled day supporting your local crafters with your local currency, with delicious food from Monticello Seasonal Cuisine.

Admission is free, and all vendors accept Davis Dollars.
