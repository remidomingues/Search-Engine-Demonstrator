Aikido is a studied as a traditional Japanese martial art. There are no competitions in Aikido; rather, we study in a cooperative manner, focusing on development of the proper form of body, mind, and spirit. Aikidoka (practitioners of Aikido) practice the dynamic integration of these forms with a training partner in order to build a repertoire of automatic body movements designed to help you neutralize attacks in a safe and effective manner.

At the DoshinAikido Dojo in Davis, we study http://www.doshinkanaikido.org DoshinkanStyle Aikido (founder: http://www.doshinkanaikido.org/sensei Yukio Utada Shihan), which stems from http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinkan Yoshinkan Aikido (founder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gozo_Shioda Gozo Shioda Soke). Doshinkan Aikido incorporates the principles of Yoshinkan Aikido with a focus on buki waza (weapons techniques), under the direction of Utada Kancho.

Davis DoshinAikido training is being led by Users/FredBarrett, nidan in Doshinkan Aikido and student of Yukio Utada Kancho. Utada Kancho began studying Aikido more than 35 years ago under Soke Gozo Shioda, a student of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihei_Ueshiba Morihei Ueshiba, founder of modern Aikido. The Davis Doshinkan Aikido Dojo is affiliated with http://www.doshinkanaikido.org Doshinkan Aikido International. We train two to four days a week on the campus of the University of California, Davis.
