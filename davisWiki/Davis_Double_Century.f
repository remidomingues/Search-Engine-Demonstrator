Sponsored and organized by the Davis Bike Club, the Davis Double Century is one of Californias most popular long distance cycle rides. Starting and ending at Veterans Memorial Center, its a 200 mile organized bike ride occurring annually on the third Saturday in May. This ride has a reputation for being a good starting double century for advancing riders. However, with the addition of Cobb Mountain in 2006, this reputation may likely change. Note that this is a ride, rather than a race; as such, riders are essentially competing only against themselves. Up to onethousand riders participate each year.

The route is pretty much the same each year, and hits the following points:
  Davis
  Winters
  Monticello Dam
  Pope Valley
  Detert Reservoir
  Cobb Mountain
  Clear Lake (you cant see the lake)
  Hwy 20
  Capay Valley
  Plainfield Station
  Davis

In addition to having to cover 200 miles, the course requires over 8000 feet of climbing, concentrated between Winters and the Route 16 turnoff north of Rumsey.

See Bicycling Activities and Clubs for other bikerelated events.

A video of the course can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?vEQz1EYtM_M.

In 2008 there were around 700 riders.

The date for 2010 is May 15^th^. The date for 2009 was May 16^th^.
