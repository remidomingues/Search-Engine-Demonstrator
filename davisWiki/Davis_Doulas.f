Doulas provide emotional, physical, and informational support to women in late pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. The word Doula comes from the Ancient Greek word for Woman who Serves.

Birth Doulas are trained specifically to prepare women for childbirth and assist at the birth itself in a nonmedical role, whereas Postpartum Doulas are trained to provide support to the mother and infant(s) in the weeks and sometimes months following the birth.

There are many Birth and Postpartum Doulas offering their services in the Davis area. As expectant parents you should contact a few different local doulas and arrange for an interview. The initial interview should be free but it is always good to clarify that ahead of time. It is important that you choose the doula that is best for you and for your family. Trust your instincts and dont be afraid to ask lots of questions. For a few tips on how to choose a doula check out the article http://www.doula.com/hireadoula.shtml/ How to Choose a Doula. Many doulas can only by found by wordofmouth. If you are having trouble finding a doula you connect with, ask aroundsomeone you know has the number for a local doula they love.

   10/24/10: I had my baby on 10/5/10 and Cyndi was my doula. She was FANTASTIC! I would highly reccommend her. jsbmsb
   04/24/13: Cyndi was our doula when my daughter was born in 2010 as well. She was amazing. I was never really sold on doulas, even though my wife insisted we enlist one. She was so right. Cyndi was the calm, comforting voice that made the entire labor so much smoother than it otherwise wouldve been. She also was very helpful when deciphering the different steps doctors and midwives wanted to take with my wife. I cannot recommend her enough, except to say we are expecting again and have already enlisted Cyndis help for baby number 2.  Users/BrianPakpour
