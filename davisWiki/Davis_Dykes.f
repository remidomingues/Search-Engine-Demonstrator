Lots of women, lots of random events board events, from meeting for afternoon cocktails to hanging out at the farmers market to hiking and backpacking hiking in the hills to mud wrestling.  It really is a DIY kind of community organizations organization with room for all the fabulous Gay Community grrlies out there.

Recently the DD crew have been meeting up for coffee on a (near) weekly basis.  Send an email for more infos.


Ooooo.  I think for the most part we are part of the strange breed that happens to be both queer and feminist.  Except for Mara, shes queer and an anarchofeminist.  Except that I think Louise is more gay than queer, and Marge is much more of an old fashioned lesbian.  Anne on the other hand is a flagtoten, unionminded bisexual. Users/MistressAlthaea
