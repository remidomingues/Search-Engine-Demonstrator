20090212 19:25:53 nbsp I have a very bad experience with Davis Electric Cars. The people there are friendly but do not deliver results. I bought a Zappy 3 on the mothers day 2008. It was broken three times in a two months period. They finally replaced another one for me. However, it was broken again.  When I returned it for repair in October, 2008. It was just sitting there forever. They did not give me a call. After several visits to their shop in person. They promised to solve the problem soon. After several weeks, the problem is still not solved. I left another message to a person there. Now it is Feb. 12, 2009. I still have not received response from them. I am very frustrated. Be very careful with this company!!! Any suggestions to get my Zappy 3 or refund for it  is appreciated.   Users/legofun
