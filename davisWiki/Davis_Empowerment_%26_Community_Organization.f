The Davis Empowerment & Community Organization (or Davis ECO) is the organization that runs the Davis Dollars Davis Dollars community currency, as well as other current and planned projects. Its mission is to strengthen the community and local economy, and empower individuals.

This is not the Davis Empowerment Project, an initiative to help train and employ members of the Davis homeless population.

 Projects 
 Service Swap bulletin boards 
One of the main attractions at the Davis Dollars farmers market table is the services bulletin board, where anyone can post services they offer or want. Davis ECO is now working to maintain a number of service boards elsewhere in the community to encourage people to help each other and get to know each other better.

Planned locations:
  Occupy Davis camp in Central Park
  Experimental College Community Garden

Considered locations:
  Occupy UC Davis camp on the Quad
  Various churches
  N Street Cohousing

 Training in Managing Interns 
Davis ECO provides training in how to manage interns. Once the community group incubator is fully functional, it will offer training to nearly any group that meets the incubator guidelines (yet to be written). For the moment, however, Davis ECO only offers this service to organizations whose missions support Davis ECOs mission (strengthening the community and local economy, and empowering individuals).

When a project leader approaches Davis ECO for intern training, typically Davis ECO will help in the following ways:
  Train the project leads in intern management
  Help orient new interns
  Work to coordinate the project with existing Davis ECO projects so they can complement each other

 Crop/Seed Swap 
In partnership with the EC Gardens, Davis ECO will be coordinating a crop/seed swap, probably to begin in Spring, 2011. People can bring vegetables and/or seeds to share, and take home vegetables and seeds from other people. This will be modeled partly on the very successful crop swap in Sacramentos Oak Park neighborhood.

 Community Group Incubator 
Davis ECO has begun work on its community group incubator. Like wiki:wikipedia:business incubator business incubators, the community group incubator will accelerate the successful development of community groups through an array of organizational support resources and services, developed and orchestrated by incubator management and offered both in the incubator and through its network of contacts.

Davis ECO envisions providing the following resources to community groups:
  wiki:wikipedia:Coworking space
  Shared physical resources (such as foldup tables and awnings for tabling)
  Coaching on organizational skills, including how to incorporate and apply for taxexempt status, how to fundraise, and how to manage interns and employees.

The incubator will be supported in part by fees from participating groups, and in part by donations and grants.

Some wording adapted from wiki:wikipedia:business incubator Wikipedia.
 Potential projects 
These are projects Davis ECO plans to begin at some point (some of which will be rolled naturally into the community group incubator once the incubator is fully functional):
  A Network Cafe (inspired by the wiki:sacramento:Sacramento Food Bank Sacramento Food Banks successful http://www.sacramentofoodbank.org/additionalresources/networkcafe.html Network Cafe) to bring together community groups and nonprofits in Davis to share ideas and create partnerships
  Revive the Davis Peoples Free School
  Revive the Volunteer Edible Gardening Team
  Create and support free piles
  Bolster Daviswiki by building out sections that would be useful to Davisites, but which are currently nonexistent or anemic (such as the How to live in a cooperative and Free Economy pages)
  Start or support a wiki:wikipedia:hackerspace
