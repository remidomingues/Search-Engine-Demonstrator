20110210 11:29:23 nbsp I just had my first appointment with Dr. Afkham today and it went great.  He and his assistants are thorough and very professional.  I did not get the vibe that anyone was trying to rip me off as I did with other dentists in Davis who have plenty of flashy equipment that I dont think is absolutely necessary, but that I do think they use as an excuse to overcharge.  Dr. Afkhams prices are very reasonable and almost fully covered by my grad student insurance.  He was thorough and offered good hygiene advice.  Im glad I switched and Id definitely recommend them!

20110609 19:40:41 nbsp I have visited this office 3 times in the past few months. Every visit was pleasant and professional.
My teeth had not professionally cleaned for a few years.
They did a great job and I am a happy client. Users/Karank

20110714 12:58:46 nbsp This page is weird. I only came here looking for the phone number for his practice so I could confirm an appointment, and read all this bad stuff about his practice. I have to say, I suspect someone is trying to sabotage his business. But in any case, I have been going there for five years now, been many times. Always polite professional service. Waiting time is about normal Id say. The staff turnover is not as fast as youd expect if he were a tyrant  the same people have been there for years. He has never tried to sell me any cosmetic procedures. He has pretty much said the same things about my oral hygiene that other dentists have; namely, my teeth are strong but I need to take better care of my gums. I think he diagnosed one small cavity in the whole 5 years I have been going there. I once had my wisdom teeth taken out at his practice and it went as smooth as anything. Quick with no pain. The stuff about the practice being unclean are just pure nonsense. Overall I have been satisfied. My wife has also seen Dr Afkham for five years with no complaints, and he rarely prescribes anything other than routine cleaning for her because her teeth are in good shape. Ive also had to cancel appointments with little notice and they have always been very accommodating. Dr Afkham is a polite, soft spoken man of relatively few words, and quite honestly I dont recognise him from some of the descriptions here.  Users/bernardmolyneux

20110923 14:24:43 nbsp I have been going to Dr. Afkham for over five years and have never had a bad experience. I came to this page to get the phone number and was shocked to read all these negative reviews. Ive been to this dentist probably 1215 times and have only been left waiting once, and it was only for about 15 minutes. Otherwise, Ive always been seen right away and given great service. Dr. Afkham has always been professional and taken the time to explain everything to me. Hes extremely thorough in his work, but Ive never gotten the impression that hes trying to sell me on anything. When Ive needed work, he gives me options on pricing and quality and never pressures me toward anything. Hes pretty quiet and reserved, but hes never been mean or rude. I also think the staff is great, especially Mary at the front desk. Unfortunately she left recently, but her replacement is just as great. Ive recommended Dr. Afkham to others and will continue to do so. I will admit, though, that this page is really strange. It does not reflect my experience with Dr. Afkham at all.

20111223 16:51:51 nbsp While Dr. Afkham’s responses here might be cringeinducing, I completely agree with the handful of others that the negative comments here and his responses in no way reflect how it is to interact with him as a patient.  He is kind, professional, and truly cares about one’s health.

A bit of my background:  I have receding bone in my jaw which causes my gums to recede.  My last dentist, Dr. Jones, and periodontist, Dr. Jolkovsky, said I had to get gum grafts.  However, my dentist before them and my friend who is a dentist have told me that gum grafts are for aesthetic purposes only.  They say that grafted tissue will never or at least rarely ever binds to your bone/teeth in the same way as your own tissue, so that the science behind stopping bone loss is shaky.  In trying to seek answers to this (which I did in a very respectful manner) I was essentially told by Dr. Jolkovsky to not come back, and I felt the need to change dentists.

What’s special about Dr. Afkham is that he cares about my overall health.  Rather than slap extra tissue on my teeth and call the problem solved, he wanted to know WHY my jaw bone was receding so very badly when I am rather young for this to happen, and have such good oral hygiene (I floss every night, use Act, and wear a night guard).  He suggested I get a blood test to check for calcium levels, as well as a bone density test.  I certainly have a family history in which checking this out would make sense.  Thankfully these tests all turned out ok, and while the recession is still a bit of a mystery, I am quite confident that it is due to grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw in my sleep which I’ve done for some time.  Dr. Afkham believes it is still best to get gum grafts, but he is willing to monitor the recession for now.  This was one question I couldn’t really get answered at my last dentist—has the recession slowed down or stopped.  I really want to stress though that Dr. Afkham was not into a quick fix, he cares about overall health, and he is patient with me while I mull over the best course of action.

My husband and I cannot get over how great the dental hygienist at Dr. Afkham’s practice is (can’t remember her name, for lack of a better description, woman with a blonde bob).  I have extremely sensitive teeth but she is able to scrape plaque off without causing one twinge of pain.  She too is very patient and meticulous about her work.

While some state in comments above that they were required to take too many xrays, I had quite the opposite experience.  At my consultation, Dr. Afkham noted that no one had taken xrays of my bottom front teeth in the last few years which is odd because that is my most problematic area.  I asked if I would have them taken at my next appointment, but he noted that my insurance wouldn’t cover xrays until the visit after that.

I’d gone to Dr. Jones for three full years and it ended rather badly.  I’d picked Dr. Jones because his and Dr. Johnson’s practice had the best reviews on DavisWiki.  Dr. Afkham probably has the worst reviews as a dentist on DavisWiki.  While I’ve only seen him twice now, I am really impressed by his care.  My husband has been going there for several years and has had very good experiences with Dr. Afkham’s practice.  Of course, maybe there is a cavity scheme (people are entitled to their experiences/opinions).  Who knows.  I do wonder though if the overload of negative responses here might have racial undertones.  Certainly, it seems that this is the type of negative editing that ‘erodes the DW community’…

It goes to show you that the comments here on DavisWiki are not always reliable and ya’ll have to go out and experience Davis in all its pain and glory yourselves!  And yes, Davis has both pain and glory and it is most awesome!  Just wear a bike helmet, to cut down on some of the pain… cuz you know… I’ll stop now.

20111223 17:32:50 nbsp I want to add that the receptionist is always such a joy cant remember her name but always so happy and delightful.  Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20120117 15:44:06 nbsp Honestly, not as bad as folks wrote it was going to be. It was a pleasant enough experience, I dont see what all the hubbub was about.  Users/DanTee

20120123 20:05:40 nbsp I and all my family have been going to Dr. Afkam for 4 years and he is the best. I challenge those who say otherwise to use their real names and specify a dentist they think is better. I have been to two others in town, and Dr. Afkam is far superior. Dr. Afkam fixed my dental problems the first year and since then I have had no problems at all, for the first time in my life. My family has had crowns, extractions, root canals and dentures, all done with excellent results.  There are two people in Davis who have personal vendettas against him and are adding negative comments here. Please beware of reviews of anyone who refuses to use their real name. Please feel free to visit his office, I am sure you will be as pleased as we have been.  Jerry DeCamp Users/jerrydecamp

20120214 19:19:05 nbsp I saw Dr Afkham recently for my first visit. he took a lot of Xrays, but i think student insurance covers them all. He didnt find any cavities, and actually commented on how good my teeth were! So Im not buying the criticisms posted above. I think theyre from people who refuse to admit that they let their oral hygiene slip. Will be going back to him absolutely. Users/AllBark

20120601 10:42:45 nbsp This dentist is the worst!!! They overchanged me for something I did not request (and specifically told me they would not)! Although the same thing probably will not happen to you, it is not worth the risk. Users/mitcholson

20120831 20:06:54 nbsp I just had my first check up, cleaning, and set of fillings with Dr. Afkham. The whole staff was very professional and friendly. Dr. Afkham informed me that I have a cross bite, so my front teeth were being ground down by the bottom teeth. He did a great job filling the chips in, and following his advice, I plan on getting invisalign to correct the cross bite. The administrator is always honest and forth write about insurance coverage and out of pocket expenses. I would highly recommend this office to anyone. Users/DustinBurns

20130205 10:41:23 nbsp I had an appointment with Julie for a cleaning from this office.  She was amazing, really nice, and very informative without being critical.  My teeth have also never felt so clean.  Last time I went to the same place, the cleaning was not half as good as what she did. So I guess it might depend on who you get.  I must also say I also got a filling done by Dr. Afkham and it went fine.  The office staff is also wonderful and very helpful in making sure all your insurance information is there.  All I had to do was tell them that I changed to the Gship insurance and they found my information for me.  I didnt have to do anything.      Users/SKbear

20130224 04:50:17 nbsp I have no complaints about the quality of their service. But I feel like they try to rip you off. I have insurance that covers preventive care, which includes regular cleaning. The first time I came here, they said a normal cleaning would not be enough and that I needed a deep cleaning. My insurance doesnt cover that entirely and I would have to pay partially out of pocket (dont remember how much it was exactly, but around $80). I thought it was weird, because I never had a problem with my teeth in the past, but I thought, sure, Ill believe you since youre the dentist. The deep cleaning took around half an hour (if not less) if I remember correctly and it felt like a normal cleaning. I got suspicious when I was leaving, because the dentist said my teeth was actually quite good, so I dont need to come back for six months, but the receptionist was trying to hint to the dentist that I still had a lot of money on my insurance and that he should make me come back sooner. I brushed my suspicion off because the dentist remained with his original 6 month recommendation.

Anyway, that was my first visit. Now its my second time seeing him. They are very unclear this time as to what treatment I am getting. From what I understand, I am getting a regular cleaning, but I still have to pay out of pocket $40 for a check up to see if I still need a deep cleaning. I already pay $2000 a year for my UC Davis SHIP insurance. I dont want to pay additional every time I go to the dentist. So I requested for a regular cleaning and not get this check up. They refused and said I had to get this check up otherwise they wont give me a cleaning. In the end, I didnt have any of it and I told them Ill just go to another place where they will offer me a cleaning. They then called back and offered to waive the $40, making it all seem even more suspicious..

Looking at the past comments now, it seems like Im not the only one who feels they try to rip you off. Dont forget to click on the link to Old Comments at the very top...

20131004 23:28:22 nbsp AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!
Dr. Afkham is not concerned with the wellbeing of your teeth. He is only concerned with taking the most money from his patients by incurring additional costs for your visits. Be very careful of him and his dental secretary Julie as they will use deceit in taking money from you. Im never going there again and I have learned my lesson at a very high cost. Users/JXLEE
