The Davis Farmers Market is held Saturday mornings yearround and Wednesdays evenings from spring to fall. Starting in late spring, the Wednesday evening Farmers Market is called Picnic in the Park and features music and other activities.  The Thursday Marketstarted in 2011 and marking an expansion to West Davisis held at the entrance to Sutter Davis Hospital. Davis Farmers Market also manages http://farmersmarket.ucdavis.edu UC Davis Farmers Market at The Silo, Spring and Fall Quarters.

The Davis Farmers Market is a mustsee for any visitor and a weekly tradition for many residents. The market is held at Central Park, at 4th Street Fourth and C Streets downtown, rain or shine, and is a http://www.cafarmersmarkets.com/ Certified Farmers Market... everything sold in the market is either grown or made by the seller, including certified organic produce, fresh baked goods, Town Flora flowers, and many other quality products. Sample delicious fruit while mingling with vendors and Townies neighbors.  The Yolo County Health Departments no dogs policy is now being strictly enforced.


Sacramento also has its share of farmers markets throughout the week, the most popular of which is on Sunday mornings from 8am until noon near 8th and W Streets.  It is held under Highway 50 (Business 80), in a state parking lot and has more vendors, more venues to buy nonorganic produce, and the prices are generally very reasonable.

 Things to Do 
  Treat yourself to a hot chicken tamale and a cold pint of fantastic freshpressed apple juice.  Or a cheese and jalapeno tamale and a fresh squeezed lemonade.  Or any of the many other tasty goods!
  Go early for breakfast or brunch. Check out the new Fat Face for breakfast sammies and farmfresh popsicles on Saturdays, who uses items from the Farmers Market vendors to create a delicious local menu.
  Please give a few bucks to the musicians  they are living their dreams and sharing their talents, and its not an easy life.
   Im a musician myself, but I also hold down a job. Why should I give my hardearned cash to some guy just because hes living the dream of smoking a pack a day and plucking strings on the street? In my opinion, give them a few bucks if youre deriving enjoyment from the performance. Thats a much better reason.
  Enjoy the free samples!  Its a great place to taste a little of everything!
  Attend Farmers Market special events: the annual Fall Festival, aka Harvest Festival in celebration of autumn the last Saturday in October, and Pig Day, every year around March 1st in celebration of National Pig Day.
  Listen to some good music on summer evenings during a Picnic In The Park .  Its quite family friendly, and you can see kids of all ages playing in the heavily chlorinated fountain and running around on the grass.
  Ride The Flying Carousel of the Delta Breeze!
  Play Scrabble with The Unofficial Davis Scrabble Club between April and October on Wednesdays.

    Tamales! I have never eaten a meal at the farmers market before, but today I decided to lay down a few bucks for a pork tamale. Delicious!
  Rajas Rajas Indian Cuisine  In the mood for a dosa, momosa, or wrap?


 Baked Goods 

  Ciocolat
  Davis Bread and Desserts  A market tradition for over 20 years. Hot cinnamon rolls and sticky buns to die for!!!
  http://www.octoberfeast.com/index.html OctoberFeast  Sells traditional Bavarian whole grain breads. Healthy and delicious.
  Upper Crust Bakery  Another Davis based bread maker. They sell their wares at Farmers Market, because their bakery is not open to the public.
  Village Bakery  Excellent breads including an Asiago Loaf that pairs well with any fruit for a lunch in the park.

 Cheese 


  2 cheese vendors sell cheese curds, which are slightly salty, and slightly squeaky.  Kind of like string cheese, but less oily.  One of the vendors names is http://www.oakdalecheese.com Oakdale Cheese.
   Oakdale Cheese: Try the smoked gouda. Great for on crackers and whatnot.  The cumin gouda is surprisingly similar with a very different finish.
  Spring Hill Jersey Cheese from Petaluma

 Other food 

  Ratzlaff Ranch (apple juice!)
  Aisu Pop: Users/PopsicleGirl Jaymes is the energetic vendor selling the frozen fruit/veggie pops. Lots of tasty flavors, and all handmade with produce from the market! Also check out the equally delicious Sammiches and HalfPint Soups, available at the market during the colder months. (The Smoked Chicken Tortilla soup is sooo gooood!)
  East & West Gourmet Afghan Food, which sells Bolani  Really good stuff. Theyll fill you up on samples alone and the guy (the older brother, also the son of the woman who helps to make it) is really nice. Well worth the money. I suggest eating it promptly when you get it though, because it doesnt taste as good after its been in the fridge (cold).
  Honey!  Multiple vendors.  Farmer MacDonald or whateverhisname is. Great honey; it far surpasses that of anything you can find at the supermarket. 1lb for $6.50. My girlfriend and I can go through one in a week. Free samples too.  Also Henrys Bullfrog Bees, http://www.bullfrogbees.com/Henry_s_Bullfrog_Bees.html.
  Gold Rush Kettle Corn is a great place to go.  The always have samples, if you want to taste some without the temptation of having an open bag of pure, crunchy yumminess in front of you.  Its hard to eat a bag in more than 1 sitting!
  Olinda Olive Oil  This old guy normally appears on Saturday mornings but has some of the best olive oil in terms of quality and taste. The Yellow Mellow oil, made out of riper olives, has a lovely buttery taste with an entrancing yellow opalescent color.
  Yolo Bulb Farm Mike Madison and his lovely wife sell beautiful flowers most of the year and plants intermittently, presses incredible olive oil, makes preserves, and grows the sweetest melons in the summer. He has also written a http://www.amazon.com/BlitheTomatoMikeMadison/dp/1597140244/ fantastic book that got a great http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2006/04/09/RVGDEI0TE81.DTL&hwblithe+tomato&sn001&sc1000/ review in the SF Chronicle about the life of a smallscale market gardener.

 Crafts and Other Nonfood 
There are some official craft vendors at the Farmers Market, and also some vendors in the nonprofit section that sell crafts. (See also the Davis Flea Market.)
  OPWES  Ordinary Percussion with Earthy Sounds, gourd and wooden drums.
  butterbean (Saturdays only)  organic screenprinted tshirts (formerly nina and tom)
  Rural Rap and Jewelry (Saturdays only)  sells jewelry to benefit Rural Rap (a nonprofit or charity of some sort?)

 Organizations to Support 

The market is also a great place for organizations to get their message out and to find new members. Tabling space is limited and available on a first come first serve basis, so organization representatives should arrive early and speak with Davis Farmers Market organizers. Some paperwork is required once a year, and theres a $20 processing fee.  Any organization offering potentially dangerous activities (Rocknasiums climbing wall comes to mind) may need to show that they are insured.  It is also recommended that organization representatives bring some form of shade during spring and summer months, as it can be very Weather hot and space under the canopy is reserved for retail vendors on Saturdays and for longselling vendors on other days.

Theres an odd assortment of organizations in this section of the market, including political organizations like the Obama 2012 campaign, nonprofits seeking donations like a group seeking to protect burrowing owls, nonprofits selling things like Davis Dollars, and high school and college student groups seeking volunteers, donations, or study subjects.

The layout of the Farmers Market  food/produce vendors on one end, nonprofits on the other end  leads to the Farmers Market UTurn: people frequently make an abrupt uturn as soon as they realize they have left the food/produce vendor section and have entered the nonprofit section.

 History 


The Market was started in 1975 and has always been in central park. During the period of the 1950s to the 1970s, urban based farmers markets in the United States saw a decline. The Davis market was one of the early farmers markets that was part of the 1970s United States urban market revival (often called greenmarkets after the New York City project that began a year after the Davis market) and the organizers still continue to advise other communities looking to open their own farmers markets.

Martin Barnes and Good Humus Jeff and Annie Main were some of the original vendors and organizers. Here is a great article written by Don Lotter about the market and its origins: http://www.newfarm.org/features/0404/davis/index.shtml New Farm

The California Federation of Certified Farmers Markets office is located in Davis, CA. For more information on farmers markets, visit http://www.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/index.htm the USDA website.

 Dogs at the Market Issue 

There used to be a http://www.cclabrescue.org/ local Labrador rescue that came to the market every week. The Yolo County SPCA also came from time to time.  Both were quite popular attractions for children and adults alike, and many animals were adopted  note the number of Labs around town!  Then another dog rescue, http://thedogspot.rescuegroups.org/ The Dog Spot started coming to the market and also was a big draw that successfully adopted out many animals.  To make a long story short, Yolo County SPCA accused The Dog Spot of something (no doubt the real issue was just about turf), and in the end, all dog rescues were banned from the market, supposedly because of health reasons.  Some people think that the people who run the market are antidog.  After all, other animals visit the market and are petted, such as the pigs on Pig Day.  The market just doesnt seem the same without the dogs.

 The above information is FALSE. Yolo County Animal Control investigated The Dog Spot and found numerous code violations including Giardia. The market decided to no longer allow dogs because of the positive tests for Giardia and the risk to the public (the opinion of the market). The Yolo County SPCA Loves the location at Petco and did not have any sort of Turf War. Feel free to call YCAS to verify this information. Ashley Dunleavy
  And who called the Yolo County Animal Control concerning The Dog Spot?  Is it really so unusual that animals in a rescue organization might have animals with giardia?  (especially given that giardia is extremely common in this part of California  many dogs get it from just from drinking out of puddles.  Arent there animals all over the park (squirrels, birds, etc.  not to mention pony rides)?  Did it really make sense to ban all of the animal rescue organizations?
   None of the animal groups were happy with the markets decision. But the point is there was and is plenty of room for all 3 groups if they were allowed. As far as calling animal control I believe it was people who adopted animals that were sick. Giardia is very common. Apparently the people who run the market are not aware of this. AshleyDunleavy
    Well, I would like to know what it would take to get the market to revisit their decision, or whether they have made up their minds and refuse to budge.  So many animals were happily adopted from the market.  It was good for families and good for the animals.
  Wow, and I thought these nonprofit, animal welfare groups would be above a petty competition to see who could get the most dogs adopted...I guess I was wrong. Whatever happened to working together and striving for a better world and all that jazz? Users/TheShah



20081119 14:44:23 nbsp Wait.  Where is the Farmers Market going?!  Why no more market after November?Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  According to a http://www.davisfarmersmarket.org/news/picnicintheparkrunslonger news item dated 2/14/08 on their website, they are not operating the Wednesday market during the winter to concentrate on Picnic in the Park the rest of the year and to give farmers a break. Users/LillianChow
  The plan is to no longer operate the Winter Wednesday Market next season and focus all our energies on making Picnic in the Park Wednesdays better than ever.  Now everyone can enjoy this wonderful event even longer and the farmers can take a much deserved break during the winter on Wednesdays. Users/Edwins ES

20090527 15:21:43 nbsp I wish Davis would get a new administrator or manager for the farmers market. The lady that runs this thing is very rude and had 0 personality, Also what is with the 4 corn dogs that taste like 50 cent corn dogs?? why do things cost so much at this market?? I love going to markets but this Davis site needs a upgrade and lower prices period. Please I would love to here from other market goers   Users/Brians

20091120 15:03:04 nbsp I agree that things cost more (think Sacramento Farmers Market, Yolo Fruits Stand and Pedrick Produce) here compared to other market. I think it caters to a different clientele (e.g. college students who live locally and dont want to drive, people looking for heirloom and organic produce), and especially the people who were just visiting the market for its festive atmosphere (which I LOVE). Its hard to swallow some of the prices there  e.g. the organic eggs there are $10 a flat, where the eggs from chickens with no hormone, naturally fed are $4 a flat at the SFM. Many farmers couldnt afford to get certified organic because of the high cost and the extra staff involved for paper work, etc, it doesnt mean we shouldnt support them.  Users/val

20100310 23:40:18 nbsp Whatever happened to Dave the Free Hug Guy!? I havent seen him in ages. I want a free hug... Users/TheShah

20100317 17:43:26 nbsp Hes still around.  Several other free hug competitors have also moved into the free hug market. You now may have a choice of hugs.  :)  (Since they are free, try them all!) Users/IDoNotExist

20100320 13:20:11 nbsp the lady who runs the apple juice stall is a bit rude  i know the juice is delicious, but damn, try to be a little polite! Users/boing3887

20100411 17:22:23 nbsp Lots of confusion and disorganization with the bounce houses. The workers arent sure how/when to take money or tickets, when to let kids in, when and how to get kids out, and how many times a kid can go down a slide. Lots of parents are complaining, but the owner didnt seem to care. The area needs to be free or more closed off with kids wearing a sticker or something to indicate they paid. Also, they need a designated shoe box or rack because shoes get left everywhere and everyone trips over them. Users/NoelBruening

20100604 16:26:28 nbsp I asked the owner of the dried fruit stand at the Davis Farmers Market whether she sells at the Sacramento Farmers Market (because I have friends who live in Sac) and she replied no. When asked why she replied that the people at Sacramento FM are so cheap. Personally I dont think thats true, considering Sacramentos best chefs, such as Chef Patrick Mulvaney from Mulvaneys Bulding & Loanshop http://www.sacbee.com/2009/09/27/2207855/chefpatrickmulvaneychampions.html frequent that market. I dont think Ill buy from someone who prejudice against shoppers again.  Users/LeeY

 Im trying to bend my mind around this. So a stall owner says she doesnt go to the Sacramento FM because she isnt making money because of the type of customers there, and youre angry about it because this is prejudice against shoppers. If shes not making money there, she can decide not to set up there. Thats not prejudice, thats how businesses operate. How scandalous. Lets punish her! Users/EdwardNiemand

20100804 13:07:03 nbsp the Sunday market in Sacramento is way better than either of the Davis ones. aside from the lower prices, the former has way more variety and Ive found produce to be a lot fresher. I go to farmers markets for food, not to see pony rides or pig races. thats just not my style. Users/AsmaMaryamMohseni

20100806 15:12:04 nbsp I have some of the BEST memories here. Its always great to go with friends, family or even take a stroll here by yourself (youre usually bound to bump into someone you know). The park is absolutely gorgeous and theyve done a lot of nice work with the plantings on the perimeter (towards B street side). Lots of open space to relax and just take it all in!

Some of my favorite things about the Farmers Market are the Wednesday picnic in the park (so nice to see the community having fun and enjoying the nice weather), Fat Face popsicles, Village bakery bread and just the bounty of produce offered there. Good food, nice place :) Users/AmberMa

20110327 03:56:56 nbsp I hit this up as often as I can. I feel deprived if I go more than a week without some Montoyas tamales, real apple juice (the kind you cant see through), and Village Bakery sticky buns... which Im generally too slow in waking to get my hands on. Alas. That said, yeah, its more expensive than going to a grocery store but its also an investment which sees more return every day.
By the way, if you want to learn to cook (in general or specifically healthy/organic/vegetarian food), this is a great place to start. Challenge yourself to buy the ingredients you see around you and either come up with recipes on your own or use the great, mysterious internet thing to find something new. Its really interesting and a great learning experience occasionally tasty, too! Users/KBathory

20110513 15:25:38 nbsp OMG THE CIDER!!! Users/Dozer

20110514 06:55:03 nbsp I saw mulberries in one of the pictures. Does anyone know if they still sell them? Users/SamL

20110601 15:17:12 nbsp I showed up today (wed, june 1) at 2:30 in time to see a few leftover vendors packing to go home. Just a warning to anyone else thinking of making the trek down on a rainy day, I came back damp and without produce. Users/EdwardRiggins
 At 2:30, are you sure they were packing up rather than setting up?  This time of year the market doesnt get started until 4:30PM on Wednesdays. Users/TomGarberson
Oops! Thanks for the headsup, I went back later and the Loquats were Huge. Im going back for more today.Users/EdwardRiggins

20111208 12:07:29 nbsp I love Farmers Market on Wednesday, but what about the food?  What other types of food would you like to see at the Farmers Market on Wednesdays?  What price range are you willing to pay? Users/DjMisschiff

20111214 12:56:20 nbsp The Bacon Classic at the Fat Face booth is the best breakfast sandwich Ive ever had in my life.  Users/sba
