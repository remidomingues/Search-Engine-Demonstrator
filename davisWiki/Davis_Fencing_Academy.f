In general we have open fencing whenever group or footwork classes are
not using the floor.  This means that any time not monthurs 46pm or
monday and thursday 6:307:00PM is open for fencing. In general, however
we tend to have the most open fencing starting at about 7PM on mondays,
6PM on wed and 7PM on thursdays and going until about 810. Right now
UCD fencing club is sharing space with us on monday and wednesday
evenings and they are bringing about 48 epeeists.

The good nights for Epee are Mondays from 810, Wednesdays from 810 and
Thursdays from 69. Users/atwong
