NB: The Davis Flea is OPEN ON THE LAST SUNDAY OF THE MONTH

The Davis Flea Market occurs on the last weekend of the month except for December. It is located at Third Space, 946 Olive Drive.

The Davis Flea Market is a oncemonthly affair that brings together members of the community in the spirit of commerce and camaraderie. It is a notforprofit driven social enterprise, promoting sustainability and opportunity. Each month, residents of Davis are invited to apply for a stand at the market where they can sell used books, cds, furniture, clothing, knick knacks, toys, arts and crafts and electronics. Its a great way to divert your clutter from the landfill and into the hands of new owners!

The Davis Flea Market is be a place for students, families and professionals, where you can hone your haggling skills, drink hot chocolate, meet friends and listen to live music. It’s like the Davis Farmers Market Farmer’s Market, but for those of us who produce more clutter than cantaloupe.

20120202 11:06:52 nbsp I was blown away by the first Davis Flea Market. In the spirit of full disclosure I happen to know one of the directors, but anyone in attendance could confirm how great the event was, bringing so many likemindedfolks together in the spirit of community! Adding live music and a DJ was brilliant, and other decorative touches gave the market a retro/indie feel; when I used to think flea market, I would imagine rows of boring tables in an empty parking lot, but the Davis Flea Market was classy, well organized, and inspiring.

Please keep it local, no out of area generic flea market vendors and please turn the music down so that people can hold a normal conversation.  Not everyone cares for DJ music. Users/JimStewart
