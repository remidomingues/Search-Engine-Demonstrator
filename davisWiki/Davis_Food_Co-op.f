The Davis Food Coop is a natural foodoriented Supermarkets & Grocery Stores grocery store. It is one of many cooperatives in Davis.  They position themselves as a crossover store, meaning they have health/natural foods as well as mainstream grocery products. They are complete with bulk bins, organic and nonorganic produce, and socalled natural foods galore. Everyone can shop, anyone can join, and nonmembers pay 5% over shelf prices. If members volunteer, they enhance their member benefits with discounts (see below). They publish a number of helpful foodrelated pamphlets; look for them in their demo kitchen in the back of the store, or find them http://davisfood.coop/brochures.html on the website.

They have a full deli, with a selection of goodies that changes daily. Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods Baked goods are made inhouse. The Deli also sells organic & local softserve ice cream, and as of 2012, draft beer. The tap selections include a glutenfree cider, and Kombucha. The Coop offers a variety of bulk coffee, with their bulk and packaged offerings including coffee from the Pachamama Coffee Cooperative, Equal Exchange, The Pepper Peddler and Folgers alike, tea, spices, and herbs. The Coop used to provide a free Public Internet Terminals Public Internet Terminal, provided by Davis Community Network DCN  but there is no longer a space or a wellconfigured http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/OperatingSystems/LinuxDistributions/BoothboxLiveCD6915.shtml booth box kiosk to run it. Outside the Coop is a Portrait of a Plump Tomato rather large tomato, a Carrot (with a tile homage to the history of Coop icons & logos), and three pedestals of concrete for future art display. The entire frontal exterior was originally a salute to a local architects desire to be put on the postmodernist map. Sheesh, you could put a tractor on top of the girdered front roof and it would not sag a millimeter.

 Theres also a Wellness (Health and Beauty/General Merchandise) section with books, candles, yoga accessories, small toys, clothing (such as socks and underwear  pricey because theyre organic), makeup and skin care. The Wellness guys and gals are very helpful and they really know their stuff. The Coop offers probably the largest and best bulk foods section in Davis. Many of the prices are mismarked by a tiny amount, but employees are happy to correct the price if you bring the discrepancy to their attention. Also notable is their peanuts/chocolatecontaining machine, which somehow turns whole peanuts and chocolate chips into a creamy, almost buttery substance suitable for spreading with a butter knife. Call it... peanut/chocolate butter.

Shopping here is a social occasion, as one may always finds ones friends (or acquaintances) here. Even the employees  if in a good mood, you will probably come to know by their first names. Beginning April 22, 2011 (Earth Day), the Coop changes its paper bag policy: they continue to offer a 5¢ rebate for every bag you bring and use for groceries, but they will begin charging members 5¢ for every new handled paper bag. For nonmembers, the bag charge will be included in the nonmember surcharge of 5%. This charge reduced paper bag usage by about twothirds from Earth Day in 2011 to 2012.

The Coop offers Weekly Specials and Co+op Deals (http://www.davisfood.coop/goodfood/sales Specials change every Wednesday, and Deals every other Wednesday). They used to offer 11 on 11 sales on the 11th day of the month, which featured 11% savings in a particular category of food or objects; some examples were beer and personal water bottles. Every so often, the Coop will do a 30 on 30 Wine Salea one day event where wine priced at $29.99 or higher is 30% off. When the checkout lines get long, particularly during sales and holidays, youll often find Coop employees walking around offering free cookies to customers waiting in line. Patrons looking for free food should be aware that the Dumpster Diving dumpster is now under lock and key.

The Coop is known for being a generous and helpful member of the community. They have supported the Holiday Meal, Food Not Bombs, On Campus Coops, and KDRT among others. In other words, they really walk their talk. The DFC roof is festooned with Solar Power photovoltaic (solar) panels that provide substantial power, although thats a small portion of the stores electricity usage (given the number of freezers, refrigerators & other electrical equipment). Outside, theres a barrel for recycling wine Cork Trees corks.

On July 7, 2005 60year old Ed Maxie, a Coop employee, collapsed from a heartattack while working. CPR was performed by another Coop employee, but Ed died in the store. The store stayed open for the day.

The 2008 Renovations include a large new buffet. Currently, theres a Indian food buffet, a general hot food buffet, and a salad bar. Theres quite a bit of variety in the general hot food buffet (chicken, turkey meatballs, macaroni and cheese, baked potatoes, vegetables, etc.) and in the salad bar (not just lettuce and other salad components, but premade salads and fruit as well). All the different items are labeled and marked if theyre Vegan or Coop Creations. The buffet food is all $7.99/lb. In 2013, the Deli added organic soft serve Straus ice cream, and beer & cider taps for draft service on the Patio.

Their Annual Report (June 2010, page 3, mailed with the June newsletter) reveals that their gross profit margin was 35.72% in 2009 (end date was misprinted). It also reveals that even with a margin target of over 35%, their profit margin was only 0.55% of income. One primary cause is the massive investment in fixtures and equipment from 2007 to 2011.

There is a Safe Credit Union ATMs ATM at the store. It is part of the Coop ATM network and is free of charge for members of credit unions.

As of 2012, the Davis Food Coop has installed a bike repair station.

 Membership 
To join, you need to pay a $5 one time nonrefundable membership fee and buy at least $10 worth of shares. In each successive year, you will have to contribute at least another $20 worth of shares annually. If/When you decide to leave Davis, or the Coop, you can cash out your shares. If you dont want to pay the five bucks for the membership card, wait until September when the new member recruitment drive occurs. There is a $300 share cap, which can be changed by a majority vote of members in any election. You can do all $300 the first year, or at any time. Feel free to also list other members of your household (roomies, family members) under your membership  they get cards too, and then you can make your spouse or whoever go and do the shopping.

Note that the Coop encourages member participation on several levels. There are a variety of volunteer positions available within the store and during special events, such as the community meal, the haunted house, or the Annual Childrens Parade. For a mere 28 hours of service per month, you can get 5% off your purchases. If you can work 46 hours per week (Monday to Sunday), you qualify as a Super Worker and get a 16.5% discount on all purchases. Your household members can volunteer for you. The amount of time you need to work to qualify for discounts depends on how many members there are in your household.  Member Work hours bank/roll over; for example, you could work an 8 hour stretch and get 4 months of 5% off. But because of the higher skill/training requirements of a Super Worker position, you cant bank Super Work hours. Its never completely simple, is it?

You have to attend a Member Orientation, which is about 90 minutes long, before you can start volunteering  however, you can apply this time towards your service hours (sometimes even retroactively so your discount starts the same month).

 History 
Started in a Davis On Campus Coops campus coop living room in 1972 with Ann Evans as one of the founders, the Davis Food Coop has grown into a fullservice food cooperative owned and operated by almost 10,000 local households.

When operating as a buying club in 1972, the organization was known as The Peoples Food Conspiracy.  Ann Evans hired Martin Barnes to be manager soon after he arrived as a UCD student in 1972.  The workers would meet at the Methodist Church on Anderson Road and divide up blocks of cheese, bags of flour, etc.  Each block captain would pick up the food and bring it to their neighborhood.

At a meeting  in 1976 in the CA House backyard Jim Eklund and Martin Barnes proposed to move the buying club into a storefront. At the next meeting Henry Esbenshade said he found an empty storefront on L Street. Mary Tappel offered to pay the first and last months rent to get them started.

They had a lot of fun opening the new store.  It was something in real life that was theirs and they spent countless hours there away from their studies   painting, organizing, and having hours of meetings with lots of laughter.

In 1978 the Coop moved to a larger location, behind the car wash on L Street  the address was now on Fifth Street. Because the store was successful, it was gradually able to expand into more rooms of this building, eventually taking over the whole back half. Ann Evans spearheaded the incorporation of the Davis Food Coop as a California Cooperative corporation. She became the President of the Board of Directors, and the Davis Food Coop, Inc. gradually took over ownership and operation of the Davis Food Coop store.

Since March, 1984 the Coop has been at 620 G Street.  In 1990, the Coop purchased the G Street building which it had been leasing. Renovations and remodeling were done in 1992 and 1997.  In 1997 the final quarter of the G Street building was purchased by the coop. FootNote(Source: Doug Walters article in the first edition of the Reorientation Guide, 2006)  Doug Walter describes the early history of the G Street location as ...shaky, burdened by the failure of other shops in the rest of the building.  We continued to improve our store, took over the master lease, found tenants for empty spaces, and finally (in the late Eighties) began a doubledigit sales growth spurt.

The Coop began in 1972 and is celebrating 40 years as a community institution. From September 7 to 9, 2012, there was a Fantastic 40 Sale with http://davisfood.coop/repository/1/193/fantastic40saleflyer_sept2012.pdf selected products on sale for about 40% off retail (for cases or large units).

 Foods, Services, & Products 

The Davis Food Coop has signed on to the http://www.foe.org/gefreeseafood Friends of the Earth Pledge for GEFree Seafood, which asks grocers to commit to the following: It is our policy to not knowingly purchase or sell GMOs genetically engineered (GE) salmon or other GE seafood, should it come to market.

 Current Issues 
 2014 Election 
The Davis Food Coop/Election 2014 2014 Election is on! DavisWiki gives coop members another chance to interact with candidates, who may (or may not) also choose to edit the Davis Food Coop/Election 2014 Election page.

From the http://davisfood.coop/about/elections Coops Election Page:
  Running for the Board
  You must be a Coop shareholder in good standing to serve on the Board. If youre a member of a shareholders household now, but dont own shares, you can run. If elected, you must purchase your own shares in order to serve.

  For more information on eligibility, please read the 2014 Candidates Packet, You can become a Candidate... (http://davisfood.coop/repository/1/757/candidate_packet_1_29_14.pdf PDF file) and the 2014 Declaration of Candidacy (http://davisfood.coop/repository/1/729/declare_candidacy_1_7_14.pdf also a PDF). If you have questions, please contact the Election Committee (http://davisfood.coop/about/elections#contact_committee link).

 Competition 
Theres a lot of competition in Davis for your food dollars. Prices for food are really high at the Coop, organic and nonorganic. It is expensive. Some members and nonmembers cant afford to go there any more. You only go there for specialized products that you cant find at Farmers Market, Safeway, Savemart, Whole Foods, Nugget, West Lake, Trader Joes. Whole Foods is getting fall out Coop business. The rise in prices usurps the 5% discount for participating members and the Superworker 16.5% discount.

To support this assertion, please cite a product and price, or this statement should be deleted. Whole Foods is actually struggling, as evident by the illegal signs they have placed on the median and cityowned guardrail. Produce is frequently cheaper at the Coop than farmers market (from same farms), and bulk foods are cheap and unavailable elsewhere. Some national brands are cheaper at national chains because of national purchase agreements, but few Coop shoppers are looking for those.  users/ScottLay

  /Election 2008 2008 Election

Two major issues facing the Davis Food Coop in early 2007 were the planning of a remodel of the G Street store and the possibility of opening a smaller satellite store in West Davis, in the former location of Food Fair.

 Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions 
A group of members  of the Coop proposed a http://www.davisfood.coop/bylaws.html#initiativereferendum member initiative to have the store boycott Israeli products (which included feta cheese, couscous, a couple of beauty products with Dead Sea salts, and Palestinianmade humus and olive oil which was then exported thru Israel). The Coop Board of Directors reviewed the initiative and http://www.davisfood.coop/member_initiatives.html found it not to be for a lawful and proper purpose, as required under the Bylaws. Its also illegal at the federal level for any US based store to take part in trade boycotts. The Davis Food Coop/Boycott, Divestment, And Sanctions Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions page has more information.

 Election:  Loan for Remodel; Board of Directors 

The DFC has finished the phases of a major remodel proposed in 2007 (and first discussed in 2005). This required a large loan, which is expected to consume DFCs profits, meaning that members can expect no patronage refund for some years to come, but the other benefits to members have kept cashflow positive during a period of intensifying local competition, and recession. According to thenBoard President Darius Pazirandeh, the renovation was necessary due to safety issues that naturally result in aging stores. Problems such as crowded aisles and other inconveniences will be addressed in the project.  Mr. Pazirandeh, other current Board members, and current DFC management support a 30year loan with a principal of more than $3.5M to finance this remodel, while a number of past Board members and other DFC members oppose this method of financing.

All parties agree that a remodel is necessary and desirable; the debate is centered around how extensive the remodel should be and how to finance it. http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html Cooperatives exist to meet common needs of members, not to produce profits per se.

On 30 May 2007, the membership voting concluded in the Davis Food Coop Spring 2007 Election.  In addition to electing three directors to the Board, the membership voted to approve a 30year loan to finance a store remodel.  The Pro and Con arguments regarding this loan measure are available on /Remodel Ballot Argument the Remodel Ballot Argument entry.

 General Manager termination 
On 20140221 Eric Stromberg, General Manager since 2000, was given a letter stating he had been terminated. This angered many Coop members as it was perceived as an out of the blue act and was voted upon in closed session. This action had been determined at the http://davisfood.coop/about/boardofdirectors/minutes/february2014specialmeeting 20140206 Special meeting.

 Satellite Store 

In late 2006, several longtime DFC members publicly advocated for a satellite store in West Davis.  West Davis residents responded favorably to a poll.

 Special Events 

 Wine Tastings 

Wine tastings occur in the Coop Conference Room (usually) the first three Friday nights of the month from 6 to 8pm. There is a fee of $1.00 per wine tasted (usually $4 for a flight of beers), with profits donated to a charity or event.

Upcoming http://davisfood.coop/education/eventscalendar Tastings are updated on the Coops Events web page.

 Classes 
The Coop Teaching Kitchen is located at 537 G Street. Adult classes are demonstrationstyle with samples and recipes, and are limited to 14 adults. Kids Can Cook! classes are handson, aimed at 8 to 12 year olds, and are limited to 12 students. Classes have a fee (with a discount for members); details and schedule are available on the http://www.davisfood.coop/classes.html Coop website.

Annual Meeting

Held often in May and recently at the Davis Senior Center Multipurpose Room, this event is a free, ticketed event for members and their guests. Coop members are introduced to the candidates for the Board of Directors and hear highlights from the year. All are invited to share food and discussion of the Coop.

In the Media
The Coop was featured on Fox40 in a ~2 minute bit at 7:10am on Friday, July 16, 2010.  The story talked a little bit about their history, their cooking classes, and foods featured there.

http://www.davislifemagazine.com/2010/07/adaviswellnessjewel/ Feature story about one of the cooking class instructors in a July 2010 blog post by Davis Life Magazine.

Students in a UC Davis Technocultural Studies class created a short film piece (~9 min.) about the Davis Food Coop and the community around it. The film won Best Community Media at the 2011 UC Davis Film Festival http://www.youtube.com/watch?vkW1D8JVdzfo Please note that there at least one fundamental inaccuracy in this film: the Coop is a consumer cooperative, not worker owned as it says about 0:35 in.

20110312 23:53:23 nbsp I love the DFC. I work there (In the deli and in the meat department), most of my friends work there, i spend most of my time there, and I buy most of my groceries there...pretty much everything I remember to buy before 10pm when the store closes. To me, here are the best deals/secrets in the store:

bulk dried refried beans. They sound gross, but theyre just as good as normal refried beans! Add hot water and a little salsa, and you have some really really inexpensive chili, mi amigo. Dip some chips in it.
bulk tea. A great opportunity to try out new types. You can use a lot of the teas to make infused vodkas too! Hibiscus vodka is delicious, by the way.
MEAT: fresh, or on aisle 4 by the cakes! Usually 3 types of ground meat, as well as a bunch of meat marked 1/2 off, all the time. You never know what its going to be, but usually theres some really good stuff! Take it home, throw it in the fridge for tomorrow, youre set for dinner. Aisle 4 meat is a good opportunity to try the weird stuff, like elk, buffalo, or the ridiculously expensive cuts that you could only afford if theyre half off.
Deli stuff: Hot Food goes on sale around 7 every night, hot food and salad bar DISAPPEARS at 8. So, 78 is the magical time, people. Also, you can get pretty much the most delicious sandwiches ever until around 9pm every night. Veggie $4.99, includes tofu!
TUESDAY MORNINGS 10AM we have a new parent network. If you are a new or expectant parent and you want to hang out with other new or expectant parents, come by the Teaching Kitchen every Tuesday! Its fun, there are lots of babies, and theres always a cool topic and there are definitely snacks. I like it because babies are adorable. Dads are welcome and encouraged to come too!! Users/mshernock

20110328 17:21:44 nbsp You have got to love the discount organic bananas! Users/DanielleC

20110406 20:45:29 nbsp I love you coop! You have the most wonderful staff and yummy food.  Oh! and you have the best meat dept. in town. Users/MaryMurphy

20110413 20:44:37 nbsp This is the best place to hang out in Davis. The staff is amazing, the events are fun and educational. The groceries are top notch and mostly chemical free. Great selection of wine, cheese and beer, and additive free cakes and bread. Groceries without plastic FTW :)  Users/MichaelNielsen
 I dont know about you, but I really prefer allchemical groceries. This is also the store that sells preservativefree pickles. Users/NickSchmalenberger

Yes, preservative free everything is wonderful.  You dont need chemical preservatives as the sugar/vinegar is preservative in itself. However, fresh food is so much better. Icecream with only 5 ingredients, milk without additives and homogenization, whipping cream with only 1 ingredient (I find it fail that the coop even has the ones with additives, though), jam containing ONLY berries and sugar, tomato paste with only tomato, etc... When I buy stuff I always look at the ingredient list if it looks industrial (fail) or like a homemade recipe (win). Users/MichaelNielsen
 Are we talking about artificial preservativefree pickles? I think the point Nick was making was that labels like preservative or chemicalfree are incorrect and, to a lot of people, silly. Users/JoePomidor
     I dont know about you, but I really prefer my food to be free of dangerous chemicals such as dihydrogen monoxide and phosphorous. Users/hankim

20110414 22:12:07 nbsp @Joe&Nick Ah, haha :) Yes, I found it strange in the beginning, too  because to me it was a given that a lot of the things that arent natural by default were natural. When I first came to the US and didnt know of The COOP, I was appauled by the ingredient lists I found in the supermarkets, and would spend hours reading the lists on all the many manufacturers of each product in vain. When I found the COOP it was a like a safehaven :)
But from reading all those crazy ingredient lists I realized why it is good to have those labels, even if artificial is implied. We know what they mean. I dont know if those labels are protected by law like biodynamic and organic is. They should be. Users/MichaelNielsen

20110418 10:39:35 nbsp Ive reviewed 6 different amber ales from the coop as to find the best one to stock up for my fiancée: Green lakes, Eel River, Jamaica red ale, Full sail, Flat tire, Boont.
No. 1: Eel River. slightly sweet, medium bitter and floral, 5/5, distinctive toffee flavor.
No. 2: Jamaica red ale: A powerhouse on all counts, well balanced sweetness, bitterness, floral notes, 4/5

These are the two Id buy. Id definitely go for the toffee notes in eel river as it is like the one I know she loves from a Slovenian restaurant that brews its own beer in the cellar.

I wouldnt buy the others. Full sail and Flat tire got 3/5, being mellow, Flat tire had some more bitterness and creaminess, but weak.
Boont and Green lakes got 2/5: Boont tasted like metal and green lakes was weird.

A coop employee was very kind to help select 6 ambers for me to review. Users/MichaelNielsen

20110604 20:13:02 nbsp I have been living in Davis for a year and I believe the prices at the Co op are outrageous. Being a community oriented business, the Co op should consider lowering their prices so more citizens of davis can afford healthy organic foods.   Users/DanRohn

  Well, maybe their products cost what they really cost, while cheap industrial food supermarkets are really the ones with outrageous costs, and in the big picture is it destructive to shop there. And I dont think people are going to starve and miss anything if they shop in the sustainable way at the coop, instead. You tend to eat less , when it actually has nutrition, what you are eating.
 For comparison sake, can you identify which products were outrageous and what the comparison products were at a local grocery store?  Its easy to make this allegation when comparing organic apples to conventional grapes.   Users/ScottLay
  An example is normal (to me) cucumbers that cost 5$ while in Denmark they cost 1$ incl the 25% tax :) But then the trick is that theres a good reason they cost 5$ here, while the weird (to me) cucumbers are cheap, and you are actually paying for that reason.

20110929 21:00:16 nbsp Big fan of the Coop! While it can be expensive in some respects, I agree with a comment that someone else made about the real cost of food. My conscience feels at ease in the Coop and the staff have always been super nice to my wife and I. Im planning on volunteering for some discount and to just have another excuse to be in the store. I want to take some cooking classes also. Go cooperatively owned enterprises!!! Users/ConsciousConsumer

20120122 20:14:18 nbsp How late is the Deli open? Not until 10pm, Ive found. Users/NicholasBarry
  Nevermind, just added the hours

20120122 22:17:04 nbsp Most definitely the best store in Davis! The vegan American flatbread pizza (http://sometimesiveg.com/wpcontent/uploads/2011/07/5935650656_808a0a6f3a150x150.jpg) is soooo delicious. We can find everything we need here. Almost everything, because CoOp doesnt have fresh yeast! Hint Hint Hint! (this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Compressed_fresh_yeast__1.jpg/220pxCompressed_fresh_yeast__1.jpg) Fresh yeast is better for baking bread and we bake fresh bread. So please, CoOp? Users/ConstantiaOomen
  Apologies for the delay, but weve found a supplier for cake yeast and should have it on the shelf in a couple of weeks (midMarch). Users/DougWalter

20120308 16:12:10 nbsp Wow, thanks so much, Doug & CoOp. I hope other people will start buying it too, its makes your fresh bread, cake etc. so much better. Bread etc. rises  a lot better with fresh yeast. Users/ConstantiaOomen

20120327 17:14:10 nbsp The red bananas are amazing! And the cashiers and staff are super nice too. Good prices, good people, good food. One of the reasons I love Davis.  Users/Ziwei.Hu

20120418 18:28:18 nbsp Today I baked bread with the (new) fresh yeast of CoOp Davis. Its the best. The bread is well risen, has an airy structure, tastes a lot more natural and the bread is a lot softer. I recommend every one who bakes anything, to use the fresh yeast (in the fridge) of CoOp.  Users/ConstantiaOomen


20120429 15:26:18 nbsp Does any know if they carry Shirataki noodles?  Users/ttl
 Yes, we have House Foods Tofu Shirataki spaghetti and fettucini noodles on Aisle 8. The spaghetti is on sale through tomorrow, 5/1/12 Users/DougWalter
     Wonderful!! Thank you so much for the answer! Im ON it.Users/ttl

20120505 13:59:07 nbsp I am reading the Vine newsletter of the CoOp of May 2012. On page 12 H.L.C. makes a remark on push pins on the public notice board and the wind making them fall down. I know H.L.C. who is writing this, because I was talking to her that day we stood there, and we kept picking them push pins up from the ground. There were dozens of them lying there! in front of the public notice board. The wind was blowing hard, like today, and we saw the push pins fall down on the ground because of this. We stood there, talking for about one half hour, and we both saw what the wind did.
I reject the answer of Julie Cross (sorry, Julie), who makes the suggestion that a bigger kid entertained himself by pulling those tacks out. This simply isnt true, because H.L.C. and I were standing there, and saw the wind rip them out, especially on the left side, like H.L.C. stated in the Vine“, piece by piece. At some point we had picked them all up, but ten minutes later, again there were at least a dozen on the ground. The wind rips at the paper on the board, and the tacks come loose.

IMO Julies remark that she has been keeping a close eye on them, and then coming to this conclusion, cant be true. The public notice board is totally rotten, especially on the left side, and H.L.C. has a substantial point in pointing (!) this out. This IS very dangerous to children, and I sure hope that the board will be replaced instead of waiting for that one, maybe lethal, accident with a push pin.
I invite everybody to go check the bulletin board on windy days, like today, because I am quite sure with strong winds, there again will be tacks on the ground.
The wind is “that bigger kid.” ;)

PS: here a recent, lethal accident with a push pin, a three year old boy dies: http://www.sandiegopersonalinjurylaw.com/2012/01/boyfatallychokesonpushpinfamilyfileswrongfuldeathsuit.shtml

20120506 12:25:28 nbsp Thanks for the reminder, Constantia. Ive just texted the coop to remind folks to check and see if this is a problem today  it hasnt been since the day I saw you there. Users/JulieCross

20120506 15:36:02 nbsp Hello Julie... great, thanks. I hope that CoOp will be able to replace the old bulletin board. It would look nice and is safer...  Users/ConstantiaOomen

20120529 08:19:10 nbsp I am somewhat of a fan of Pliny the Elder, (the beer, not the guy.) and havent been able to find it at the coop for quite some while. Now I learn that it is kept hidden in the back somewhere. WTF? Users/PaulThober
  The whole situation is a WTF? Russian River Brewing has been able to supply the Coop & every other retailer a small amount of this beer, but never anywhere near the demand. We understand that other retailers have also gone to crazy systems, like lotteries, secret passwords, favoritism, or random riots when Pliny is put on the shelf. We have a twobottleperday limit on purchases, just because we thought it lead to less dissatisfaction  but we will continue to try to figure out something to deal with this continuing unusual situation. Users/DougWalter

 20120626 18:50:35 nbsp Well, lets see, its been almost a month since I made the above comment. I shop at the Coop almost every day. I havent seen one bottle of Pliny on the shelf yet. What is the deal? Users/PaulThober
   Theres been a new sign on the subject of Pliny posted for about three of those weeks. We know this beer is awesomesauce but its hard to come by due to small batch production. In the interest of cooperation and fairness, weve decided to limit purchases to two bottles per customer per release. When Pliny comes in, we send out word via email. If youd like to be added to the list, please email our buyer at MailTo(ceklovsky AT davisfood DOT coop)   Users/PaulThober, you can find the sign at the beer case (low on extreme right end, close to the Meat counter) OR on the side of the cooler next to the soda shelves & opposite the middle of the beer case. Users/DougWalter
    Get on an email list to buy a beer? OK, I give up. Users/PaulThober
     Sorry. Its Russian River Brewing that has created this situation where demand far outstrips their production, and (again, as far as we know) other retailers have also had to create strange systems too. Users/DougWalter
       Could be worse... Pliny the Younger gets totally ridiculous to find.  People take vacation time and fly to other states to get it.  jw

20120725 14:38:41 nbsp The Coop is a great place to get kegs of beer of various sizes. I have been working with the lovely Claire for over a year now purchasing a number of kegs from the Coop for social functions. Her customer service and helpful attitude have made shopping at the coop an absolute pleasure. They have a binder where you can order kegs from an extensive listing of breweries for nearly everything from local breweries to even Belgian varieties. (They can even get Abita for you Mardi Gras veterans.) She has made several phenomenal variety suggestions based on my palate and has been willing to order custom kegs from me with no hassle.

20120805 15:14:40 nbsp My comments here are intended to give insight to the Coop to a potential member population and resources that I think might be overlooked. I admit that I am not a member of the Coop (though I plan to join soon) and my comments may not encompass the values, mission and current structure of the Coop. However, I believe that the comments I make to the Coop may shed a light on an essential gap that exists between the Coop and prospective new members and expansion of the business base. Ive tried to be as straight forward and concise as possible.

Even though Ive lived in Davis for most of my life, and Ive been aware of the Coop, I havent, until recently, realized the benefit and reasons to stop at the Coop. To start, my family doesnt invest in sustainable living at all and werent involved in the community growing up. It wasnt until the past year that Ive discovered sustainable living practices and began to apply them to my own life. Im relatively new to this way of living and would like to learn more. I feel that some basic information about what sustainable living is, and how the Coop can help you achieve and contribute to sustainable living is important. While the main website mentions sustainable living, theres a presumption that the person viewing the page already knows what sustainable living is, why the Coop finds importance of sustainable living, and how the Coop helps to achieve sustainable living.

I have several comments organized below in order to provide some indepth insight to some issues I see and would personally, love to see addressed.

Website
The website focuses quite a bit on the board of directors. Im not entirely sure as to what the website design purpose was, but to me, the site design doesnt focus on the overall goals of the Coop. It seems that the site is afflicted with a bit of information overload in certain places and lacks information in other areas that I would be interested in (products & services). Additionally, I am disappointed that the Annual Report is buried in the Board of Directors page.

While local products are listed out, hyperlinks to the individual websites is not offered. While Ive been told I can buy a local product, more information is lacking that I would like to use in order to assess whether or not I would like to actually purchase the product. While I know this can be perceived as a nitpicking subject, providing the name of the provider and not a link diminishes the purpose of listing the providers: information.

I am thoroughly impressed with the Sacramento Natural Food CoOps approach on their produce page (http://www.sacfoodcoop.com/index.php?optioncom_content&viewcategory&id27&Itemid73). This provides me with a link to where my food came from. In addition, I really like their local growers map. However, this map falls short as well. Im told the name of the business/provider but not what products the name is associated with.

In short, the website fails to pull me in and leave me feeling informed. Also, the link to P6 which claims to offer additional information about the Coop does not provide me with additional information. The P6 page for the Davis Food Coop is blank.

If there is additional information that addresses these concerns, after digging around the Coop website for ten to fifteen minutes, I have not found it. This is a fatal flaw in the website design. I have failed to be informed by the site and I cannot find the information Im looking for in an easy and efficient manner.

Annual Report
When I reviewed the most current Annual Report, I found myself disappointed as well. The brochure layout is difficult to read in PDF format. While I can still reasonably read the information presented, it would be easier to read if it were laid out in a single page format. In addition, even though the report lays out a table comparing FY 0910 and FY 1011, I am forced to scrutinize a six digit cash value and determine the difference in my head. While the information is useful and I can arrive at the calculation on my own, Id really like to see another column that represents the difference between the two fiscal years. The intent of the balance sheet has been overlooked, and is ineffective as a graphic. Although the differences are discussed in the text below, I have to hunt for this information. The Annual Report should be easier to understand and laid out in a user friendly manner. In addition, the last panel which lists an exhaustive list of community sponsorship does not encourage me. I like that monthbymonth highlights are provided with dollar amounts, however, the list that comes after that simply lists additional contributions does not encourage me. <b>There is no transparency.</b> The total dollar amount given back to the community is not noted. In order for me to figure out this information, I would need to go through your entire list and contact the individual agencies and do my own research.

I do not feel the Coop is being intentionally deceptive with the Annual Report, but I do feel as though the Annual Report was not put together with the aim at educating members and keeping them well informed. The final product may not have been scrutinized as thoroughly as it should. I believe some basic attention to detail is missing, reinforced by grammar and spelling errors found throughout the Report. While this is understandable, and I do believe the people at the Coop are hardworking people, blemishes such as this can really tarnish the Coop and the reputation of the Coop.

While interesting, the Annual Report fails to inform current members. Id like to see the mission and values stated in the Annual Report, better graphics/tables regarding the current fiscal situation, current efforts to meet and exceed the mission and values, future efforts and a high light of achievements from the year. I want to feel well informed about current issues and future issues surround the Coop. I want to feel included through informative information. I feel the Coop has a well fleshedout idea, and now its time to really lay down some structure and establish a common format that will be used in future annual reports in order to maintain consistency in information and instill trust that the Coop is being completely transparent.

Social Media
According to the 2010 census, 33.2% of the Davis population is made up of the 1824 age group and 22.6% of the Davis population is made up of the 2544 age group. This represents 55.8% of the Davis population and does not include the UC Davis Campus.

This means that at minimum, you can be assured that the 33.2% of the population composed of 1824 year olds are actively using social media. Specifically, Facebook. Social media is quickly replacing mainstream media sources. Utilized correctly, social media can greatly increase your ability to reach out to the community. In addition, the Davis Food Coop Facebook page insights that are viewable by the public identify the 2534 year old age group as the most popular age group (people who talk about your page). Obviously, the Coop Facebook page is being read and used. I myself have subscribed to the Coop updates. However, I find this pointless as often events are not publicized at least a week in advance, and reminder updates regarding events are not put out. By the time I check my news feed, events have started and as I have chosen to be carfree, I cant make it across town in a reasonable amount of time to participate OR posts are so last minute that I just dont even bother to go because Ive made other plans. One such example taken from a July 20, 2012 posting is: Sierra Nevada tasting starting in just 15 minutes. 68pm, $5 gets you samples of all 8 beers and helps feed hungry kids  whats not to love?.

Id really love to see more frequent updates regarding events, better time spacing and the events function that Facebook offers used. This would also allow the Coop to gain insight as to how their information is being disseminated throughout the community and help focus their message and methods of communication.

Interactions at the Coop
Ive been to the Coop three times in the past three months. Each time Ive arrived, Ive been overwhelmed at the selection at the Coop. This is awesome! However, I find myself lost and intimidated by the amount of choices that I have, and I have no idea where to look for most items. To my dismay, a graphic displaying the layout isnt in sight, and my attempts to find help have failed. I look to find people to help me, and I cannot find them which is dismaying because on one of these occasions, I was looking for a salve that I knew the Coop carried though I couldnt remember the name and was hoping to find someone to help me find it who worked there and was familiar with the products. I spent 20 minutes trying to find what I was looking for. In the end, I was successful, but I was irritated.

In addition, the three times I was rung up, I was asked if I had a Coop membership. I said no, and the cashier didnt attempt to ask me if I was interested in signing up for one. I found this shocking at first, and felt that I had been dismissed. I didnt follow up with the cashier about a membership which is a lack of assertiveness on my part. The two following purchases yielded the same response from cashiers. It was rather confusing and disappointing and makes me not want to seek out a membership or inquire further. This isnt Target where Im not interested in additional features, this is the Coop, based around community involvement. When I feel unwelcome and uninvited, my interest to be part of it disappears. I dont feel a sense of community. I feel an atmosphere that is selective.

My Goal
The Coop is awesome. Despite these draw backs, I will still be joining the Coop. However, as a prospective member, I feel there is ample room for improvement. This is my way of trying to help as a Davis resident and member of the community.  Users/MichelleKoehler

20120806 20:43:26 nbsp Im Lis Harvey, the new Communications Coordinator at the Coop. MichelleKoeller, thank you for your thoughts! We appreciate feedback. I am very sorry to hear you felt unwelcome and uninvited when a cashier did not ask if you wanted to set up a membership. There could have been a line of other shoppers behind you, or your body language might have been misinterpreted. Without a date or the name of the cashier, it is hard to investigate what went wrong. Our staff does try to intuit when people are in a hurry, and we are very respectful of the time each transaction takesparticularly during busy hours of the day. However, we would love, love, love to have you as a member, and would love to help you become one. Everyone is welcome to shop the Coop, and anyone can join! That is true from 7am to 10pm, 364 days a year. Ask any staff person for a membership application (or email Membership if you would like one in the mail), and youll be pointed in the right direction. Our annual membership drive begins August 29, but a quick walk back to the Membership Office on a weekday (past Mermaid Sushi and around the corner before the restrooms) is the fastest way to join.

Im excited about the changes we have in store for the Coop this fall: we are unveiling a shiny new website in September, installing a series of energysaving doors along the Dairy aisle (reducing the energy usage in that area by a whopping 70%!), and outfitting our staff in new aprons and vests that will help you find the right person to ask, next time youre in the store and hunting for a hardtofind product. Some great events on the horizon are the Teaching Kitchens Birthday Party (8/26), the Fantastic 40 Sale (9/79), and our annual Eat Local Fair (9/28) & 40th Birthday Bash. Thats not to mention our Fridaynight wine tastings, cooking classes, and more. As far as events are concerned, http://www.davisfood.coop/events.html, Facebook, and our email lists for members are the best ways to stay informed. When in doubt, you can also email me (see below).

Please let me know if you have more concerns. Im happy to help, and always available to answer questions by email!

Cheers,
Lis Harvey
Communications Coordinator for the Davis Food Coop

20120807 00:41:31 nbsp Thank you Lis for the attention, and congratulations on your position! Im glad to see the Coop keeps track of social media sources and is responsive to commentary. This is a very positive sign.

Im not entirely concerned with pointing fingers at cashiers and meant no harm. Ive worked in retail and sales and understand that people are people and were not always perfect. Im not asking for an apology but thank you for offering one. I do appreciate the sentiment.

Im excited to hear about all the new changes taking place, and thank you for outlining this information. I will be dropping in sometime soon for that membership.

I do want to reiterate that I think the Davis Food Coop is awesome. I appreciate the hard work that all the members, volunteers and staff do. I truly believe in what the Coop is doing, and I fully believe in supporting it.  Users/MichelleKoehler

    EHarvey announces Were outfitting our staff in new aprons and vests that will help you find the right person to ask. Poor staff, now theyre attired like the giant chess pieces in Alice In Wonderland. Only less dashing or stylish. Everybody now looks uniformly unhip. Seems to me itd be more respectful of staffs individuality and taste to let customers ask who to ask?! (Put up signs to that effect perhaps)...  Users/RaoulDuke

20130131 16:41:31 nbsp Any chance of more wholegrain mustards at the deli? (Or even on the shelves would be nice!) Also is it possible to specialorder unusual sizes of DFC promo clothing? Like XXXXL or more? I LOVE YOU GUYS!  Users/AlexPearson

20131012 17:40:13 nbsp I noticed CoOp has improved on their prices and has some very good, lower prices now (for vegan food). Thanks! Thanks for carrying products of http://sugarplumvegan.com/ too! They are very tasty. It seems the facts have turned around a little. Now CoOp has better prices than Wholefood IMO. Keep up the good work, keep surprising us and stay sharp.  Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131120 14:19:32 nbsp Hi, I am looking to buy a handy tools I used to use in the Ozarks and they sold them thru our food buying club. It aids in opening up those (hard to open) 5 gallon buckets we all stored our bulk foods in. We used old drywall buckets, but coops sell them new sometimes. I dont want the buckets, I am looking for the simple wooden tool that pries those lids off. If anyone is familiar with these handy utensils and knows where I can buy one, could you let me know? Users/carylbrt
  Im familiar with bucket openers, but never have seen one in wood. Nor has any of the three people I spoke with here. Sorry to disappoint you, but we dont have a source at this time to sell you one made from any material. Users/DougWalter
  Ive never seen a wood one either, but you can get plastic pail openers from ULINE. If youve never ordered anything from ULINE this is a great opportunity to start. They have the best customer service, deliver everything next day, and throw in crazy freebies when youre purchase gets over $100.  http://www.uline.com/BL_8163/PailOpener     Users/MikeyCrews
  I would check at ACE Hardware in the paint tools section for bucket openers.  My roommate got one there once.  Ive also found a metal once here: https://www.lehmans.com/p3362metalbucketopenerhammer.aspx   Users/JudithTruman

201422714 Strange days indeed. The General Manager is fired and no one concerned will say whyonly that the Coop is going off in a new direction! Users/BrianKenyon
  A lot of people have seized on a comment that was quoted in The Enterprise, because it was the only words out there for 48 hours: Current board president Stacie Frerichs cited “a new strategic direction” for the Davis Food Coop during the open session of Monday’s discussion... The change in direction is a change in leadership. That was what I was told in a meeting with staff by Director (and Board Secretary) Zoë Plakias, in the presence of Directors Diane Parro, Desmond Jolly, and Ed Clemens, so thats authoritative (as far as it goes). The letter to members and shoppers is http://davisfood.coop/repository/1/772/co_op_members_bod022614.pdf here for you to read. Users/DougWalter
