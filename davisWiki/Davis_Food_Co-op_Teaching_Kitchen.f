The Davis Food Coop is proud of our Teaching Kitchen. It retains several features from the buildings original interior (floor, windows) but has been built anew as a place for instruction and gatherings. Image(food.jpg, thumbnail, 300, right)

The kitchen is located at 537 G Street, across the street from the store. Join us!

Regular http://www.davisfood.coop/classes.html classes with varying fees continue (with breaks in December, and July).

They installed a sign out front in 2010, reinforcing the Coops tomato theme.
