 More Details 
Don Shor and Lois Richter first started chatting on DCTV (Davis Community Television), when Lois asked Don to come next door and talk about plants on her hourlong tv show.  (The station is next door to Dons business, http://redwoodbarn.com/ Redwood Barn Nursery, and for years he has been helping decorate the sets of various tv producers.)  After having done about a dozen gardening episodes as part of Lois Thoughtfulness television show, the opportunity came up for them to join in the brandnew local radio station  KDRT  and the Davis Garden Show was born.  (That was supposed to be a temporary name while we came up with a catchier title, but we never found anything better.  Sort of like how the Davis Fire Crew ended up with its name!)  Lois got so wrapped up in doing WEEKLY radio, that she has stopped doing the monthly tv show altogether.

Lois was designing websites when the radio show got started, and had heard about a new (3monthold) techthing  a podcast  and so she set up their show as one of the first http://davisgardenshow.com/podindex.xml RSS podcast feeds around.  Podcasts are still available (as are MP3 files) on the http://davisgardenshow.com/ Davis Garden Show website.  Now KDRT also has streaming radio so the show can be heard LIVE around the world.   (Starting KDRT radio streaming means downloading and opening the file http://davismedia.org:8000/kdrt.m3u http://davismedia.org:8000/kdrt.m3u )

The biggest problem with radio?  It is sometimes hard to describe plants over the air, although Lois is always willing to try!
So Don added to the original show website and has created a place for a photo each week  usually a featured plant.  Occasionally there will also be a link to some other site that has been featured on that weeks show.

Suggestions for topics are always welcome.  As are questions.
