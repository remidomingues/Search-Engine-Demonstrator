20100709 11:42:00 nbsp This little place is a gem.  You can find all kinds of cool little collectibles in here.  Old coins, jewelry, political pins.  He also gives a pretty good rate on scrap gold.  The owner is very nice and knowledgeable.  Users/DagonJones

20100920 12:58:58 nbsp Ive been going to the G&S Exchange for 20 years. It is a little holeinthewall, but Pete is always very helpful and informative.  I have always found him to offer fair prices. Before buying jewelry at a mall shop, I would check out what he has. It is a fun little place. My kids now enjoy going there.  Please support local businesses like his.   Users/LMWold
