The Davis Golf Course, known as the Davis Muni to Townies locals, is a public golf course located in sunny Davis, California.  It is an excellent course for the person who plays occasionally or just wants to learn the game. If you are hacking the ball around you wont feel uncomfortable here, like you may at Wildhorse Golf Club. Also this course is inexpensive, you can often play a round for as little as 10 dollars or find special rates through their internet specials. Its a rather short course, but still has 18 holes with 4953 yards from the blue tees and 4428 from the white or red tees.  Davis Golf Course features a driving range and two putting greens.  A snack bar is also available and serves breakfast, lunch, and snacks.  Reservations for tee times can be made a week in advance, and clubs and carts are available for rental.  Gnats can sometimes be a nuisance on the course (staffers post a notice at the clubhouse if the gnats are out), so keep your favorite insect repellent handy, just in case.

Instructions are given by PGA Professionals Mark Hansen, Gary Lipelt, and Chris Mapalo.  Lessons are $30$40 each or six for $150$200 and you only need three days notice.  Adult group lessons are offered throughout the spring and summer.  Theyre relaxed, thorough and inexpensive, and are great for beginners or experienced golfers in need of a refresher.

There is an annual tournament for young players aged 10 through 18.  The Junior Tour culminates in away games.  Young players also get a discount on lessons, paying only $15 per lesson.

The course also hosts a 9hole, noncompetitive beginners league on Tuesday evenings to give new golfers the opportunity for experience on the course without pressure from more experienced golfers.
