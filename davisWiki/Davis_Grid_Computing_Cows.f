Davis Grid Computing Cows is a group of people that donate spare CPU time on their computers to solve problems such as reducing world hunger, finding cures for AIDS, cancer, dengue fever, hepatitis C, the West Nile, and Yellow fever viruses, and malaria.  The software to do this runs in the background on your computer, and can be set to take as little or as much of the CPU and memory as you wish.  By default, it will not run while you are on battery power.  You can schedule it to run at times when you would not normally be using your computer, or if you are idle for a certain amount of time.
