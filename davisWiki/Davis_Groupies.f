20051113 00:59:11 nbsp I have a question, is Davis groupie simply someone who doesnt attend UCD? Can they live in town and not go to school or is it really outoftowners who dont go to UCD? Users/MichelleAccurso

20051113 07:26:32 nbsp Is this saying that a person of college age who doesnt go to UCD doesnt belong here? If so, then the next step is to pass a law preventing them from being here. 1930... Users/SteveDavison
  Exactly! This page is semijoking though, Steve. Its a response to being angrily questioned whenever Im in Davis. You dont go to school here? Then WHY are you HERE?!? Ha ha, they would so pass a law, those crazy NIMBY Yuppies Yuppy Townies. I just know I sure do get a lot of heat for hanging around in Davis, Im wondering who else gets it. Users/MichelleAccurso

20051206 22:47:36 nbsp Oh my god, I am so glad I found you. I have always felt like such a groupie. I am moving to Davis within the next month, have been hanging out there for the last year and a half as a nonresident, and will not attend UCD. The kicker is that no matter how familiar I got with the town, visiting every few weekends from Humboldt, blending in with the biking students, I still had to be told by my finacée at every corner whether we were going straight or turning. I could just not find my way somewhere logically without going in circles, to the physical danger of my friends who thought they didn’t need to tell me when to turn: “she must know her way around by now.” I must blend in quite well. No one has ever hassled me. Even in EU III and Bainer at all hours of the day and night. Do I just smell like an engineering student?   Users/JessaRego

20090816 02:34:16 nbsp (Does every college aged resident attend UCD? The demographics of that must be AMAZING!)

Does it ever occur to you that the Davis student body as a whole (of which almost all of them fit into the age range of 1830), is almost half of the population of the whole town? So yes, the demographics do show it. Technically, its almost a 50/50 yes/no if you ask someone college aged in Davis if they go to UCD or not. This isnt including anyone who attends Sacramento State or its Extension in Davis. Users/IdealParadigm

20100131 18:35:58 nbsp Im still a student, but what happens when you graduate UCD and still live in Davis (for the rest of your lease or for another year; in other words short term as oppossed to a townie)????  Users/BryceH
