Davis H.O.P.E is a mission started by UC Davis students to address the issue of Homeless Resources homelessness in their community. The team provides education at the local homeless resource center in topics ranging from health issues to computer training. The ultimate goal is to create an environment where Homeless are given the educational tools to improve their quality of life.


Current Programs

Computer training
The purpose of this program is to improve computer skills for the homeless. The computer is essential for searching for jobs, creating resumes, looking for places to live and other tools necessary for homeless people to improve their lives. This group will be designing lessons to teach homeless people computer skills ranging from the basic function to more advanced subject like using word and other programs to make resumes etc. In addition responsibilities of this group include collecting donations of computers/related materials. Group members will be responsible for creating and teaching the lessons.

Dental health
One of the most essential areas that we need to address is Dental Health for the homeless. Lack of dental care for the homeless is a serious issue that can lead to significant infection and sickness. This group will focus on improving dental health by creating lessons to be presented to the homeless on proper brushing and flossing techniques, information on the importance of health care and how the homeless can prevent oral health problems. The Davis community meals center provides toothpaste however they really need a toothpaste dispenser where contact can be minimized to prevent transfer of disease. Additionally we need donations of Items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and mouthwash. The Dental group will be in charge of getting donations and creating/ teaching oral health lessons. Expect to give about 2 or 3 lessons one hour lessons

Bathroom Project
The Davis Community Meals resource center serves anywhere from 50 to a 100 homeless a day however they current only have two bathrooms and only one full (toilet and shower). This becomes problematic and currently the resource centers greatest need is for an additional bathroom. The goal of this project is to make this happen. That includes contacting local businesses (hardware stores, etc) and coordinating with the volunteers at the center to plan the building of the bathroom.

Basic life skills are important for improving the quality of homeless people however we can not underestimate the value of the arts. These programs are intended to encourage and provide an outlet for the residents of the resource center to express their creativity. These programs are intended to be fun and help increase the happiness of the residents
