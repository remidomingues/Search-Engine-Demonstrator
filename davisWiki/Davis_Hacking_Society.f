 What is it? 
http://hackingsociety.org Hacking Society was dedicated to fostering the Geeks geek community, through the shared experience of http://catb.org/jargon/html/meaningofhack.html Hacking.  It was around for a little while, but is inactive currently (Oct. 2006).

 Who is it for? 
Attendees of Hacking Society are often known to believe that collaboration is the key to success in any endeavor and that it is communities that make computers worth using, and that programming is an art form as opposed to class work or resume fodder.  This chapter of Hacking Society also lacks the LUGOD LUG affiliation which means users of all languages, operating systems, and editors are welcome.

 What do you do there? 
  Make the wiki a better place for mankind through http://projectsycamore.org/ code. (Users/PhilipNeustrom & Users/DavidReid)
  Argue about processes vs. languagelevel threads vs. event loops. (Users/DavidReid & Users/PhilipNeustrom)
  Bug Philip about bears.

 What can I do to help? 
The most important thing you can do to help Hacking Society succeed is show up and contribute.  A missed meeting here or there isnt going to hurt anyones feelings but if programming is something you love doing (or would like to learn to love doing) you should show up as often and for as long as you can.  And when youre not showing up, you could print out one of these http://dreid.org/tmp/dhs.pdf snazzy http://dreid.org/tmp/dhs.ps fliers.

 The Future 
To the hackers and geeks of Davis, CA:

Users/DavidReid I have in some sense been the driving force behind Davis Hacking Society, and while my personal experiences at individual meetings have been productive and inspiring, the lack of attendance has hurt my pride more than once.  Lack of time and energy and a perception that people didnt really understand the point of DHS has prevented me from making it as great as I know it can be.  But now Im being removed the equation, on May 15th I start a new job in Cupertino, CA and will be unable to regularly attend DHS meetings.  So this is a letter to the hackers and geeks not just of the wiki but of Davis, CA, hacking society was never meant to be my pet project, I never wanted to be the leader of a group, I just wanted the group to exist, so I did what I could to help it exist.  Perhaps I was wrong about Davis, perhaps the community just isnt there, but I find it truly bewildering that community that could build and nurture something like DavisWiki could possibly lack the community spirit.  Perhaps I never explained what DHS was properly, but thats because I dont know what its supposed to be, its not supposed to be a rigidly defined group with strict agendas and time keeping, Hacking Society was never meant to be more than a time and a place and reason for people with a common interest to get together.  And that is what it has been, for me and Users/PhilipNeustrom Philip and Users/SteveDavison occasional Users/ZacMorris others.  Perhaps I didnt deal with criticism as well as I should have, perhaps I alienated people, whatever I did wrong, or just didnt do, its now up to you the people if its worth doing right.  I hope in my failure you can find the secret to success. Users/DavidReid
  I wouldnt call it a failure. If you expected 100 people, I guess it was a failure, but otherwise no. When do you leave Davis? You could always commute to DHS meetings... Users/SteveDavison

I went there 20060216 6:00PM, waited an hour, but NOBODY showed up. Not Philip, not David. Users/SteveDavison
  We were both there at 6:30 or so.  I went to grab a burrito because I was hungry.  David and I came back and no one else was there (until about 9pm, then we left).  Users/PhilipNeustrom
Thats strange, I recall being there at 6:30PM. Hmmm. We must have just missed. Users/SteveDavison
  Its unreasonable to expect everyone to show up on time every time, and the smaller the group of regular attendees (which is 2) the less likely there is to be someone there at 6pm on the dot.  Things happen, busses are late, people get hungry, Im sorry no one was there when you got there at 6, but Philip and I were back at 6:30pm.  On another note, every meeting is going to suck if you dont have anything to do there.  Some people have complained about being ignored in favor of code.  I didnt organize Hacking Society as a strictly social event, (this is a college town, there are plenty of those already.)  But ... perhaps Im going about this all wrong, perhaps I should just quit now before I stress myself out anymore about this. So consider this my final plea for help, if youve never been to a Hacking Society, for whatever reason, you didnt think it was for you, there was something that conflicted in your schedule, maybe you just dont like Roma, I dont know, tell me how I can change it so that you will come, so that you will enjoy it, so that _everyone_ can benefit from it. Users/DavidReid
    I really think we should try and get that Philip Neustrom guy to stop showing up.  I mean all he does is talk about bears and it makes some people kind of uncomfortable.  That would probably solve a lot of the problems.  More seriously, I honestly dont know why a bunch of people dont show up and dont care all that much either.  Its nice programming and stuff with others around, makes me work better, makes it easier to ask for suggestions and opinions.  And its fun to bug Philip and David without them being able to ignore my AIM windows.  Roma is perfect for something like this, especially later on in the evening when most of the people head out and we are the only ones there.  If people dont show up its their loss.  No open minded technically inclined community for them.  More power outlets for me. Users/ZacMorris

I move that the meetings be moved from Cafe Roma to Delta of Venus. They serve food there, have beer, and have WiFi. Users/SteveDavison
  Isnt delta usually packed on thursday nights/have shows (seems they start at 8:30ish)?  If we could snag a table early on this might be a good idea, but Id hate to feel like that guy on his laptop :) Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Youre right, Thursday would suck. How about Mondays? One of the reasons for low attendance I believe was scheduling conflicts a lot of things happen Thursday nights. Users/SteveDavison


Lots of conversation about this topic that was lost to the ether can now be found at Davis Hacking Society/Talk.  Hopefully this will recreate interest in what is a really great idea and maybe more people will start showing up.  Users/ZacMorris


Since nobody was at yesterdays (20060427) DHS meeting, and the founder (Davis Reid) has moved away from Davis, I move that we disband the DHS and consider it absorbed into the LUGOD social meetings. They do have active meetings (1012 people attend the socials), and its at nearby Delta of Venus. All in favor? Users/SteveDavison
  I havent actually moved yet, but I am currently out of town and will be moving shortly, however here are my thoughts on the subject.  I dont think DHS should be disbanded, but I do think it should coincide with the monthly LUGOD socials.  Once a month is just too infrequent for the 4 or 5 hours of hacking that DHS provides.  All the other Hacking Societies have a LUG affiliation and the pattern is basically have a meeting every week except for the week that the LUG meets (this isnt necessarily necessary if they meet on different days of the week.)  So my final suggestion before I officially leave, is to have DHS meet at the same time and place as the LUGOD social gatherings _every_ week, and let any crosspollenation happen naturally. Users/DavidReid
     This sounds like a good idea to me. Users/PhilipNeustrom
       Im pretty sure it is a unanimous decision then.  Ive edited to reflect the venue change, however I did not change the start time, according to LUGODs meeting page the social gatherings dont start until 6:30.  I leave it up to the community to decide if the flexibility created by the differences in time schedule is useful, those extra half hours of hacking can really add up. Users/DavidReid
         I changed the start time to 6:30PM (it was approx. anyway) for simplicity/uniformity. I think having it first Tuesdays only is better just because I dont think enough (>3) will show up the other times. Having a meeting with one person is a waste of time; better to concentrate until you have some sort of critical mass. If there were 5 people every week I would say have it weekly. Well see. Even when we did meet we did almost nothing collaboratively. In a way, its sort of a backwardstelecommute: instead of getting computer technology so we dont have to travel to a meeting place, here we have technology and meet in person. Users/SteveDavison
