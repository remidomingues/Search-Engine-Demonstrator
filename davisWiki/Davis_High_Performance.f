Davis High Performance(DHP) is a program founded by Davis High School auto shop teacher Mr. Willner. It was started in December 2004 as the creation of the Doom Buggy took place. The small program has grown since. It is now taking in several donations (full cars). These donations are then repaired and sold to help pay for new tools that were vandalized in the summer of 2004. DHP has had some exciting cars come in and out of the shop doors. Crowds of DHS students block the Auto Shop parking lot as they stare at the loud and magnificent cars that roll of the lifts and are started for the first time.
