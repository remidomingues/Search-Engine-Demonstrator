The Davis High Red Cross Club is, well... the Red Cross club of Davis High School.   Formed fairly recently, they support the American Red Cross of Yolo County, and host CPR classes and give safety presentations to the local Girl Scouts and at the Farmers Market.

Founding president Clarissa TonNu http://www.ycarc.org/index.php?prRed_Cross_Clubs was recognized at the Woodland wiki:Woodland:Chambers annual Womens Luncheon, and spoke at their annual Womens Luncheon.  She started the club and grew it to 25 members within two years.
