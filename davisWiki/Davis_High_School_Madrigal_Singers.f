The Davis Senior High School Madrigal Singers (or for short, the Mads), are an auditioned group of 32 a capella singers performing music dating from the 15th century to the present. Formed in 1966 by Richard M. Brunelle, this highly competitive class demands the best of these young musicians talents. Each Madrigal designs their costume interpreting the dress of the upper class in late 15th through mid16th century England. During each school year, they perform in school concerts, public places and events, private parties, and music festivals. In December, they preside over a 16th century holiday feast; the Madrigal Dinner is one of our communitys longestrunning musical traditions.

The Madrigals Director, Dr. Karen Gardias has been the Madrigals director and chair of the Davis High School Music Department since fall 1993.
