20090804 17:28:00 nbsp I have used Davis Home Trends twice and have had perfect service and the quality was top notch.  I decided to go with them because of a recommendation from a neighbor (their blinds and shades were beautiful as well. We had remodeled the upstairs and went with Budget Blinds and although the owner was very nice, the quality and service were subpar.  I still regret doing that and can really say you get what you pay for.... Users/LokiAbbi

The store is beautiful and the staff is so kind and friendly. This store definitely represents the fine Davis hospitality that every student and resident of Davis should support!
