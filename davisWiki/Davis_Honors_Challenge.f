20121011 15:24:25 nbsp Being in the DHC has connected me with faculty, introduced me to likeminded peers, and best of all: a chance at the artandscience fusion course taught by Dr. Ullman! It was the neatest class Ive taken at UC Davis, and I wouldnt have had the opportunity without the DHC. Now after I graduate, Ill have an art piece in the arboretum to commemorate my time here. :) Users/RandomCandor
