Davis Housing: The Print Edition is a free publication listing most/all of the commercial apartments available for lease. It is nicely laid out, lists the amenities, floor plan, map location, and rates for each apartment complex. You should also check out their website.

It can be found at the west entrance to the Coffee House and the Memorial Union information desk, among other places.

It is 8.5 x 11, approx. 120 pages, printed in color on uncoated (nonglossy) paper. This makes it inexpensive as well as highly recycling recyclable.
