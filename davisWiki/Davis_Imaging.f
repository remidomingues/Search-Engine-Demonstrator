Diagnostic imaging, nuclear medicine, and radiation oncology. CT, open MRI, ultrasound, mammography, routine, and diagnostic radiology were  available at Davis Imaging.


The building was originally occupied by The Wherehouse which provided Video Stores movie rentals as well as dvds, cds and video games. After The Wherehouse closed, it was briefly occupied by Rubios.

Trader Joes wanted to build on the land that Davis Imaging occupied. However, RAS had a 14year lease and had spent more than $1 million in building upgrades. Therefore, it was unwilling to move.  Eventually, they did, however, in part because they lost their Sutter contracts when Sutter decided to do its imaging in house.  (See the TJs page for further details on the history).

Demolition on the building began in April 2010.

20070603 20:04:12 nbsp (Edited) This building used to be The Wherehouse. You could rent videos and buy cds and videos here. Then it became a restaurant. I remember the display in front with cold bottles of beer sitting in a giant display of ice. The restaurant closed soon after it opened. Users/Jedron
 It was a Rubios, actually, but same premise. Was pretty happy when they opened, bummed when they closed, but have since Chuys Taqueria learned to cope. Users/KevinChin
