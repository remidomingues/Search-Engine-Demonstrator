When I first came to Davis (in 1968), we used to joke that the dirt piled wherever the University was excavating for their next building was Mount Davis!  Of course, it moved around from time to time.  After they built the railroad overcrossing at Covell, we finally had a permanent Mount Davis and the joke slowly died out. Users/LoisRichter
  Oh ... Ive always called that Mount Covell! Users/DougWalter
