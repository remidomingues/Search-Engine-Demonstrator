Israeli Dance Club

Israeli dancing is fun and accessible for all ages. The dances are done in circles and lines without partners. Davis Israeli Dance typically starts with slower, easier dances to warm up, along with some teaching, so if you are new, come early. Later in the evening we start into the faster and more difficult dances. The Davis group includes dancers of all ages, from our elementary school students to seniors. The group is open to the public, you do not have to be a member of Congregation Bet Haverim to join in. Attendance is free, but there is always a donation bin in order to thank the congregation for allowing us to use their space.

Meeting Times

Davis Israeli Dance meets every 1st and 3rd Thursday (and sometimes 5th Thursdays as well, when there is one) at Congregation Bet Haverim, 1715 Anderson Road in Davis from 7:009:00pm (though sometimes it has a bit of a slow start.
