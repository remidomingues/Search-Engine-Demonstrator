Danzan Ryu Jujitsu was founded in the 1920s by Henry Seishiro Okazaki.  Danzan Ryu or Cedar Mountain Style, named in reference to the Hawaiian Islands were it was developed, is a combination of techniques from a variety of martial arts, including jujitsu, judo, kung fu, aikijujitsu, and lua.  His school, Kodenkan or School of the Ancient Tradition, was named in reference to the practice of having more senior students teach more junior students, a teaching tradition honored by the Davis Judo Kai.

Philosophy: Everyone is welcome to come learn this unique martial art.  This style is accessible to all ages and abilities.  We are committed to the idea that all who come in our doors is  Ohana, family.  We strive to practice Kokua, help given without any thought of return.  What makes this style different from some of the other martial arts is that we train in order to perfect our character.  In essence, we are studying Judo, in the sense of The Way of Gentleness.

Classes begin with an invigorating warmup and stretching routine, including some strength and conditioning exercises.  Students also learn rolls and falls, allowing practice of the jujitsu arts in a safe environment.  The system is comprised of lists of techniques starting with very basic escapes from grabs all the way to weapons disarms.  These techniques are taught and practiced in a kata or form style with a partner.

20090922 Davis Judo Kai is a great place to train for Ju Jitsu. I have been coming here over a year and have trained in tae kwon do and judo. Sensei Lyle Najita is a great teacher. You work at your own pace in a laid back environment. Danzan Ryu is based on traditional Japanese Ju Jitsu that anyone can do. Highly recommended. reviewerDarrel Secrest


20090101 16:50:12 nbsp My son has been taking classes here since he was 4 years old, and Lyle has been a steady leader all that time.  Now age 10, my son sometimes finds it difficult to fit judo into his schedule, but still attends whenever he can.  The emphasis on selfawareness, selfimprovement and responsibility has been a very positive influence throughout most of his life.  Highly recommended. Users/JimFrame
