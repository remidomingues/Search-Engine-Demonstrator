 About Us 
We are a group of Judo enthusiast people. Most of us are students from UC Davis. Beside having fun, practicing Judo enhances your stamina, strength, and coordination (like a dance). Our official practice times are above. Anyone who is interested is welcome to check it out. To prepare for the workout, judokas should try to drink more water during the day and get well hydrated before class time. Although we have water breaks (a.k.a. Huynh breaks as of 20051220 02:15:31) during class, lots of drinking during class is not recommended.
If you get bored in between practices like Tony did, Sensei Users/HarryvKendall recommends that you do pushups, and pushups, and more pushups. And if you are still bored, try the switches and hops. Push ups give you upper body strength for the grip fight. Switches enhance those hip motions for setting up the throws and the mat fights. Finally, doing hops gives you greater stamina and quicker hip movements.

  Members Of Special Recognition 
There was once a founding member of the UC Davis Judo Club named Kevin Akio QuanHe Nii. He has graduated now and move on to other pursuits but his legacy lives on. Kevin was a quiet man who had strong opinions and beliefs but kept them to himself. He wasnt the most gifted athlete but was the hard worker who showed at every class, no matter how much in pain. Over the years Kevin achieved a level of performance few would have perceived him capable because of his dedication and determination. I watched Kevin every class and many times marveled at his tenacity. Kevin was the president of the UC Davis Sports Club for two years. We usually have a president serve for only one year but because of the lack of qualified people to lead the club I asked Kevin to do it another year. True to his nature, even though he had many other obligations, Kevin agreed to another year. If it were not for the sacrifice and dedication of Kevin this club would not be what it is today.
Every quarter I will identify the person who best embodies the spirit and determination of Kevin Akio Quan Nii. There will be silent benefits bestowed.

The first award was difficult because of so many qualified candidates. Derya Ozes with her silent determination and will to succeed. Travis McIntyre with his never say give approach and his quiet pursuit of perfection. Abel Hernandez with his quiet progress to perfection. But one stands out more than all others. He does no win very often but is always willing to fight the toughest of them all. He takes fall after fall and never complains but returns with his silent dignity and demands another round regardless of the outcome.

Michael Owens is the first winner of the Kevin Akio Quan Nii Award of Silent Dignity. The dignity and Bushido he displays cannot go unnoticed.

I am honored to know you.

December, 2011  Tiff Ho is the recipient of the Kevin Akio Quan Nii Award of Silent Dignity.  It was not an easy path to first place at the CCSF tournament this year.  Tiff never missed a class whether sick or healthy and worked hard always. Not the most gifted athlete on the mat, Tiff always made it up in hard work and grit.  UCD is a better team because of her.
 
In the summer of 2006, I was invited to Davis to consider beginning a judo program. I asked the ARC to allowed me to have a summer program before making a decision. Considering the non urban, uncosmopolitan environment of Davis I was concerned with the type of student I would find here. That first class resolved all the issues. The room was overflowing with people and the quality of athlete was impressive. Towards the end of class, myself and three others I had brought with me lined up and offered to do randori with any takers. All was going fine, you now know what fighting a beginner is like, until this rock looking kid stepped up. We bowed and he immediately stepped in, picked me up and slammed me to the mats. I got up smiling that Im going to kill you smile and proceeded to dismember him but noticed the quality of movement and natural strength. Rocco went on in the years that followed to be the smoothest, prettiest thrower in the dojo; arguably in the country. This award is named after Rocco Lucero; the man of silk.

There are many in the club who have impressive technique. Calvin Diep and his O guruma and Osoto gari. Kevin Yoo with his Ippon Seonage and Seoi Otoshi. Derya and her Kouchi gari. But one person stands out for his beginning mastery of the art. Travis McIntyre had to switch from right hand to left because of an injured knee. He has developed a Harai goshi that has earned him a Directorship in the Redemption Through Harai goshi club. And his other techniques are almost equally as impressive. From a skinny, sagging, binge drinking crack addict to the honorable, powerful mans man he now is; Travis McIntyre, a.k.a. Polar Bear (or butt cheeks if you catch him sagging) is the winner of the Rocco Lucero Best Technique Award.

December, 2011  Matthew Favetti is the recipient of the Rocco Lucero Best Technique Award.  Matt has become popular around the tournament circuit for his left side Osoto Gari, tomoenage and Deashi Bari.  Matt works hard to develop his techniques unlike the original man of silk who was just born to do judo but the end result is the same;  beauty and power. UCD is a better team because of him.
 

Three years ago, a very unusual and intense girl of 19 walked into the dojo to give judo a try.  She left without showing much interest but returned days later.  While running backwards I stumbled on her feet so I stopped the class and lectured her on moving out of the way and looking out for others.  We began running again and I again ran up on her feet but this time tripped and broke my foot.  As I yelled and ranted at her I thought for certain she would leave and never return.  The next class, she came into the back room, where I was wrapping my foot  and quietly apologized for not moving.  Through my anger I could see tears forming in her eyes.  She asked if I would allow her to take the class again and I croaked out a yes: something in the look in her eyes was so demanding i had no choice.  She left the room more distant than when she entered and over the following weeks became more reclusive than before.
One night we decided to have tournament competitions and all the women of the dojo swore they would drive out the reclusive one.  When I called for women in the center the strange girl quickly volunteered and ran to the center of the mat.  Everyone was startled and challengers quickly ran to the center to be the first to fight and defeat her.  I, too, thought she would be defeated and never return.  Upon yelling hijame, they both grasped gis and the other girl attached with osoto gari.  The strange one stopped the attack in the last moment before success, and with a loud grunt, aaaarrrggggggg, she turned the momentum and threw the other girl with the force of a black belt.  The strange one looked me in the eyes with the force of a bull and quickly scanned the room for other opponents.  It was then, that I saw, for the first time, the warrior she was to become.
This strange girl would time and again win first place in every tournament.  White, green and then brown belt.  Opponents grew so fearsome of her, they would cry when they saw her name on their pool sheets.  I personally witnessed opponents approach her after the tournaments and declare she was the strongest person they had ever met.  In 2008, while planning for Collegiate Nationals in Wisconsin, the strange one approached me and declared, I have no money to go but will do fund raising to pay my way.  No one had ever done a successful fundraising for the UC Davis Judo team.  The strange one came back after a few days and gave me the name and number of a person at the games center at the MU.  I called and discovered we were given the first ever games center fundraiser in which all games were free and we paid the first $1, 200 dollars to the house and kept the rest.  We raised over $1,600 dollars in one night and were on our way to Nationals.  I was approached by the strange one and in a whisper she stated that the cost of a blue gi was too much for her budget and would I be willing to purchase it from the funds we made from the fundraiser.  I was humiliated that she had to ask.  I immediately gave the funds for the blue gi and for the first time saw a smile indicating the strange one was not strange at all.   I had just failed to see what judo meant to her.  What the UC Davis team represented to her life.
We didnt get to go to Nationals that year , for many sordid reasons, but the lessons were not lost.
And then, that fateful day in March of 2009, in San Jose, at Collegiate National Championships.  After surveying the field of contestants I didnt think she stood a chance.  But after so many tournaments I knew to not doubt her.  She walked by me and stated, unequivocally, this shit is mine and stomped off to glare and stretch.  I sat on the side of the mat for her last fight and watched the bruiser walk to the center.  Derya stomped out like she owned the place.  A quick Hijame and Derya ran across the mat and slammed her down.  No score.  After going out of bounds, she did it again and again no score.  Im raving mad but more shocked that none of the referees protest.  Again they stand them up and Derya quickly steps in again and slams her opponent to the mat.  Ippon  the referee finally yells.  Derya Ozes, in the span of two years, becomes Collegiate National Champion.

Derya Ozes has become the spiritual leader of our team for many reasons.  It is with a heavy heart that we wish her well in her new adventures in life that require her to return to her homeland of Turkey.  This award is in honor of her accomplishments in the short time we have known her.  For her fierce desire to be the best, her work ethic unmatched by any and her fearless pursuit of victory,  the first Derya Ozes Living Legend Award  has been awarded to Derya Ozes.  How appropriate Derya is the first recipient of an award bearing her name.
 
THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR AWARD

Is this judo was the question that stopped me dead in my conversation that late evening in June, 2011.  i looked up to see a smiling kid with a gi under his arm and smiled broadly because I knew he was our new summer high ranking Judo student from another land.  Shodan? i responded, anxious to know how lucky we were.  Sandan he shouted with a wider smile that made my heart  skip a beat.  So began the powerful story of Taishi Moriyama with the UC Davis Judo Club.  There was an immediate impact on the training habits of the club.  Between drills, when everyone else was catching their breath, Taishi would either run in place, lifting his knees high into the air, or squat as low as possible, holding his weight as if suspended from the ceiling.  Or, he would often do double of everything by doing his set of exercises and then do them again when it was his partners turn.  Soon, all who could were imitating Taishi and all who couldnt tried.

Taishi refused to tap and expected everyone to fight equally as hard.  What a new strong spirit he brought to the club.
At his going away party, Taishi announced he would be leaving his gi and his special obi with the UC Davis team ( a bar he and other judoka use to frequent in Japan was a favorite of the local Yakuza.  They liked the Judo people and would often challenge them to fights.  His obi was a present from the Yakuza and when you get the chance to see it youll appreciate the quality of the gift he has left us).


After each tournament, someone maybe awarded the Ultimate Warrior title.  They will be presented with the Taishi Moriyama gi for safe keeping.

January, 2012
Walter Lam has informed the club that due to his impending graduation this spring, this will be his last quarter training.  We are struggling to imagine a UCD Judo club class without Walter Lam.  He has been a permanent figure in the club for three years and in that time has gone from a skinny kid afraid of the dark to one of the fiercest fighters this club has ever known.  Every tournament Walter walks onto the mat and faces the best and win or lose, he returned to the dojo and continued training for the next fight.  No matter what happened, we knew the sun was going to rise, birds were going to fly and Walter was going to be at class.  Due to the transient nature of our time here four to five years is the most we get to spend with each other.  Walter has taken advantage of his time with us and we recognize his achievement in awarding him the gi of Taishi Moriyama and the title of ULTIMATE WARRIOR.
