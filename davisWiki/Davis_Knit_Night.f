Every Monday night, community members and students meet up at differing cafes or eateries to share the joy of knitting. Beginners and experts alike are welcome, as there is a wide variance of skills. Youll find plenty of help, yarn, and beautiful handicrafts at Davis Knit Nights. New knitters are always welcome to attend, and below you will find our calendar of locations. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a message for ChristyMarsden Christy as she is an ongoing member of both Davis Knit Night and DavisWiki.





 Calendar of Locations 
We will meet at Stonegate Video Stonegate now that summer is over.
All knit nights begin around 6:30 and end around 9:00. Times are not set, and you are welcome to come for as little or as much knitting as youd like.
