Davis Korean Church is a nondenominational evangelical mission based church.  Davis Korean Church was founded by nine UC Davis graduate students in 1982 who began meeting together and eventually established the local church.  Though DKC initially focused on the Koreanspeaking community (both students and families), it expanded to include a diverse Englishspeaking group, having their own services and events.

Currently there are 2 pastors on staff:  Pastor Joshua Lee (Sr Pastor) and Pastor Daniel Yoon (English Ministry Pastor).  There are about 210 Koreanspeaking adults, 40 Koreanspeaking college students, 80 Englishspeaking adults, 150 Englishspeaking college students, 60 youth group students and 100 children.

Mustard Seed Ministry

Their englishspeaking campus student group is Mustard Seed Ministry (MSM) which has a diverse group of believers, who meet every Friday at Young 198 at 7pm for worship with music, a brief sermon, Bible study and fellowship time which mostly consists of games and activities that develop relationships between participants.

Green Olive Tree Ministry

Green Olive Tree G.O.T. is the Koreanspeaking campus ministry affiliated to DKC.  It is a growing ministry founded in 2007, with a diverse group of Koreanspeakers.  Many of them are students who are bilingual and some are students who have come to Davis to study English for a year; others are student who are studying abroad for 4 years.

20090717 17:55:39 nbsp Our yard shares a fence with the parking lot of the Davis Korean Church. While for the most part they have been good neighbors, on two separate occasions cars have driven through the fence into our yard. On one of these occasions, the car drove through my husbands workshop, and he would probably have been seriously injured had he started work a few minutes earlier.
No steps have been taken to install strong barriers to prevent a reccurence, and the new construction has compounded this problem. There is now a paved parking lot with no barriers, and a downhill slope from the parking lot into our fence. The parking lot has been open less than two days and already cars are parking with their bumpers hanging over the edge. We are seriously concerned for our family and our neighbors safety!
More details and pictures are posted at http://www.koyoteknives.com/church/. Please contact the church and let them know that this situation is not acceptable! Users/JessicaLuedtke

20090720 10:05:03 nbsp Understand, we enjoy the church as a neighbor they are polite and never start too early, they tone down the sound before 10Pm, they have a wonderful community feel and make excellent neighbors. Its just that we now have the equivalent of a 3 foot fence  ZERO privacy and the parking barrier situation was supposed to have been (I was told by the maintenance pastor) fixed with the new construction.

20090729 16:42:51 nbsp We talked to the PM for Hilberts (the Contractor for the construction) and he said there should be plans in place for something called city designed parking barriers not sure when thats going to happen, but they should be on the way.  Users/PopeChristof
   Thats got to be an eyeopener in your backyard on a Sunday morninga car crashing through your fence and workshop. Thank goodness your husband is alright. I used to live in the neighborhood and remember the previous church would have maybe twenty cars in the lot of a typical quiet and dignified Sunday a few years back. I cant believe theres this many Koreans from Davis attending the church now? Barriers seem like theyd only be a stopgap till someone in a hurry hits the gas and Drive instead of Reverse again. Perhaps the outoftowners could organize car pools or maybe the church could get a bus or two to make the rounds out of town and pick up congregants (who now drive into Davis) for Sunday services. Some kind of mass transit solution would obviously be the ticket. Users/BrianJKenyon
