Davis Life Chain is part of an international http://www.lifechain.net/ Life Chain activism prolife event that occurs every year.

Annually, on the first Sunday in October, people across the country organize Life Chains that call on prolife people from all walks of life to stand and reflect/pray for one hour. The Life Chain commonly occupies both sides of a downtown street, where the traffic is slow and heavy. Participants, standing or kneeling on the sidewalk out of the way of both foot and vehicular traffic and 10 to 50 feet apart, silently and prayerfully hold signs urging an end to abortion. The chain lasts for one hour.

The Purpose

Life Chain is a time for prayerful selfanalysis, repentance, and serious commitment to helping end abortion in our nation. Life Chain is not chiefly a demonstration, and its witness is not intended for the viewing public only. Instead, its first goal is to minister to its own participants, andÂ— to those who call Christ their Lord and hold prolife convictions that declare abortion a grave evil that defames the name and holiness of God (Leviticus 18:21). Indeed, some believe that the Church that Christ founded has drifted into cold indifference toward the sacredness of human life, and the result has been the unnecessary and, some believe, morally reprehensible abortions of over 45 million FetalAmericans, plus untold millions who have fallen victim to abortive chemicals and medical neglect.

It is important to note that Life Chain is churchoriented and pastorfocused. This means that the key to a successful Chain is for local pastors to educate their congregations about abortion and then lead them to the sidewalk where their Chain is to be held. Without firm pastoral support, a Life Chain will not fulfill its potential for saving lives and changing hearts.

A Short History

Life Chain began very close to Davis in wiki:yubasutter:Yuba City and wiki:yubasutter:Marysville in 1987. The first Life Chain, with over 2,000 participants, elevated the prolife movement out of the handful of fundamentalists mindset, to a level of high respectability in Yuba and Sutter counties.

In 1989, Bakersfield took Life Chain into Southern CA with 7,500 participants, and Riverside, CA followed with 6,000 in attendance. In 1990, Orange County, CA increased participation to 17,000, while Fresno, CA had 10,000, San Diego 20,000 (and a month later 28,000), and Sacramento 16,500.
