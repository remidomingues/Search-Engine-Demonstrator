http://www.davislifemagazine.com Davis Life Magazine is a wonderful and perhaps wiki:wikipedia:Divine (actor) divinelywiki:wikipedia:Pink Flamingos inspired addition to the Davis media scene. In the style of other City magazines, Davis Life Magazine has been designed as an online magazine (ezine) to highlight restaurants, organizations, businesses, people, and Events Board local happenings in and about Davis.  (Funny  isnt that what the Davis Wiki does?  Oh, wait  the Wiki documents, not highlights).

You can signup for a free online subscription to Davis Life Magazine so that youre notified when new stories are posted. You can select all of the categories, or only the ones that interest you.

They just launched their new format on May 1, 2010. They feature daily content written by over 20 bloggers with photos and features about Davis and the surrounding region.
