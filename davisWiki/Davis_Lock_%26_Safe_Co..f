The metal building is expected to be demolished in early 2012. A demolition notice also mentions an apparently associated storage building at 911 Fourth Street, which is expected to remain intact for the time being.

There is a sign in the window dated 2004 that says to call them, but that they are no longer maintaining store hours.

Originally, the store closure had been intended to be temporary. There seems to have been an issue with asbestos which shut down the store.

3/06 I just got off the phone with Davis Safe & Lock and was told that the shop in Davis is closed.  The phones are forwarded to the parent company Wallace Safe & Lock in Woodland.
