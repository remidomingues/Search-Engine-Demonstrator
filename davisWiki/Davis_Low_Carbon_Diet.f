The Davis Low Carbon Diet is a citywide program designed to help households save energy and make a real, measurable difference in the fight against global warming. The program provides households with a menu of actions to lose those carbon pounds. Each household structures their diet according to what works for them.

DAVIS RISE TEAMS UP WITH DAVIS SCHOOLS TO JOIN THE CITY OF DAVIS’“LOW CARBON DIET CHALLENGE

For five weeks, RISE Leaders will document Davis students’ habits of diversion, recycling and reusing as well as collecting “rigid plastics”(plastic resin numbers greater than #1 and #2) that would normally go into the school’s garbage. What makes up 5,000 pounds? Can the schools divert 5,000 pounds of rigid plastic from the landfill?

Each DavisRISE School Leader will create a way to get the rigid plastics to Davis Waste Removal where the plastics will be weighed, to document the impact that this could make on reducing at the landfill as well as the school site. The participating schools will create their own campaigns and methods of collecting and documenting until November 16th. Charts and documenting will provide data for contributing to the Low Carbon Diet.

Everyone is eligible to participate in the Low Carbon Diet, and Kickoff is October 12, so logon to http://cityofdavis.org/pgs/lowcarbondiet/and join an EcoTeam today!




 CITY ONCE AGAIN CHALLENGES RESIDENTS: LOSE 5,000 LBS OF CARBON IN 30 DAYS

The City of Davis is beginning the next stage in the LOW CARBON DIET CHALLENGE, challenging the community to take part in a program to reduce household carbon emissions. In this 30day program, Ecoteams made up of friends, family, coworkers are asked to find ways to “lose” 5,000 pounds of carbon through easily implementable lifestyle changes.

The program is based on a workbook published by the Empowerment Institute entitled “Low Carbon Diet: A 30 Day Program to Lose 5000 Pounds.” The workbook outlines ways to best improve household energy efficiency and uses lighthearted illustrations to make the book fun to use. Most practices described are easy and inexpensive to implement, and can save household energy costs and gasoline expenses significantly. This workbook has successfully been used in other cities around the nation including Portland, Oregon, and effectively enables citizens to take direct action in the fight to reduce global warming.

The Low Carbon Diet shows how to make real change in residential energy use and transportation. What could be better than to live in a building or neighborhood where the residents are working together to build a more sustainable and resilient community?
