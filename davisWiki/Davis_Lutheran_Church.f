A visitor to our church shared with me that a posting on the Davis Wiki seemed very unlike their own experience of this congregation and wondered if I had seen the posting from ximemurillo, dated 20131125.  I shared that it had been many years since I had been on the Davis Lutheran Wiki page and I wasn’t even aware that we still had a presence on it.

After reading the posting I feel I need to offer some clarifications about what is presented.   I am saddened by the experience Ximena had on our campus and I attempted to speak to Ximena directly on the phone and also arranged a personal meeting to clarify what was presented in her posting, unfortunately she did attend our planned meeting.  I want to clarify what I believe are misunderstanding of Davis Lutheran’s role in her experience.

1.	Davis Lutheran offers the use of our campus to many notforprofit organizations.  During the time of year that Ximena came to our campus seeking a Thanksgiving meal, STEAC (Short Term Emergency Aid Committee, see their website) uses our facilities for its holiday donation program of providing support.  While this congregation does an amazing number of things, Davis Lutheran does not donate Thanksgiving meals; it provides space for STEAC to offer its holiday programs.  Having spoken to all of our church staff and members of the church council about this, I believe Ximena encountered the STEAC program on our campus that day.

2.	It has always been Davis Lutheran Church’s mission to offer our campus facilities to groups and organizations.  With that mission comes the risk that we cannot monitor the experience of all persons who come to programs, events, and activities that other organizations offer on our campus.  We feel it is our gift of hospitality to the community of Davis to offer our space when it is available to groups and organizations.

3.	Davis Lutheran offers many forms of support to both local and global social ministry programs.   The generosity and kindness this congregation offers in this community I believe is well know.  Hours of volunteer time spent on supporting the Interfaith Rotating Winter Shelter, our partnership funding support to a variety of local organizations from our annual Picnic Day BBQ, World Hunger support, Campus ministry meals and funding, Community Meals volunteers, local social worker support through school supplies and backpacks, St. John’s Shelter Adoptafamily Christmas ingatherings are just a few of what I could go on and on about the countless ways this church and it members and friends offer themselves to others in need with gracious and generous hearts.

So while I am truly saddened by the experience that Ximena had on our campus, I believe our community is well served by Davis Lutheran Church and it’s mission to be a church guided by kindness, hospitality, generosity and care for those in need.

Blessings and peace,

20131125 11:15:35 nbsp       Last week I had an experience that I would like to share. My husband and I have 3 children and work from home caring for children (daycare provider) and like all who are self employed, sometimes you ride the crest of the wave and sometimes your under it. In these last few months our income has changed some and it can be stressful because of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years approaching, but as my family taught me God squeezes but does not choke. A friend of ours told us that the Davis Lutheran Church was donating Thanksgiving meals. She gave us a flyer which had three requirements. We discussed it with my husband and decided why not, we should not be ashamed to ask. So on 11/15/13 we went to the church with our Ids to prove we lived in Davis, our ebt card to show we receive assistance, and our 5 medical cards to show there are 5 of us in the family. This is what the flyer asked for to qualify for the meal.
     This where for me as a religious person, began something unheardof. The woman there told us that these documents were not enough, that we also needed to prove our income. My husband said that since we are self employed we could bring our Taxes from 2012. She said they needed to see something recent, and asked me if I could bring in my bank statements to prove my income. She also asked how much we made so that she could compare it to the national poverty level. She looked on a sheet of paper and said that we did fall below the poverty level, but we needed to prove it. Without questioning why and feeling somewhat humiliated at the time, I ask myself and you now how much does the church need from us in order to gift me a turkey. Maybe for the Lutheran church I am not poor enough, but that is not the point. After this the lady said we could come back within the hour before they close or Sat from 111. We told her that we could not and she said that Monday might be too late, because the list was almost full, thus ending the conversation.
     Unheardof, I want to know what about he who needs most, those who do not have paperwork, illegal immigrants, those who do not have money to return 2 times to your church, those who can not show residence because they dont have one or those with out bank accounts because they do not have money. SORRY, but I believe you have lost the objective of what is a donation.
     I aslo asked my husband if maybe it was because we are Catholic and we should go to our own church, but they never asked me about that. I am someone who is constantly donating things. It is easy to donate, you dont question and most things are received with open arms. But I have never been in a position of asking and it truly is difficult. You really need to have humility to stand in front of a peer to ask for something you need and to also have to prove your need to such an extent.
    Finally, I just want you to remember as my Christ said, that same that you follow,
      Give and do good without looking at who
What is being poor? He who does not have money or he ho lacks a soul.

Thank You very much

Ximena

P.S. If I had enough or extra I would never take something from someone that needed it more than I.
