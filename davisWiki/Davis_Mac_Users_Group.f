Davis Mac Users Group (DMUG) is the official http://www.apple.com/usergroups/ Apple user group for the city of Davis.

Meetings are held at the Senior Center on the second Tuesday of every month. Usually meetings go from 6:30 to 8:30 PM. Topics range from general questions to specific presentations, and usually there is plenty of time to address troubleshooting and other related questions. Despite being at the Senior Center, all ages are welcomed to attend the meetings.

There are no membership fees, but donations are encouraged. Also, the Senior Center features free WiFi Hotspots WiFi access.

The current leader, Eric Thompson, usually brings Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods cookies.

 History 

The idea for DMUG orginated with Apple enthusiast Martin Barnes of The Flatlander who was joined by Larry Dieterich of The Mac Paramedic (now known as White Wave Digital), Hanh Le of Baytel, Michael Beaucage and others.  Meetings were initially rentfree at the Senior Center because of perceived benefit to seniors.
