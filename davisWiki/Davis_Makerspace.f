They currently run a shared workshop in Downtown downtown Davis, (informally known as Suite 1337).  Current members include engineers, programmers, and artists (among other things).  Davis Makerspace is currently funded through donations from its own users, and is working through the process of attaining nonprofit status.

Suite 1337
The current DMS workshop, a.k.a. Suite 1337, is located in the Tim Spencer Alley, behind Woodstocks Pizza.  It is housed in a converted storage unit, and painted a dull green.  It can be identified by the 1337 not painted in red on the door. Hackers know 1337 is very wiki:wikipedia:Leet. Inside, DMS members have installed a security system, upcycled duelpane windows, refurbished lockers, worktables and more.

History
DMS started in 2012 under the temporary name Davis Community Workshop.  Early meetings were held at Bike Forth, and later moved to the Omsoft facility on 5th street.  Its development was more or less grassroots in nature with a loose consensus decision making process.  They incorporated in winter of 2012 as part of the nonprofit application process, and have been working to gain nonprofit status through most of 2013.

DMS scouted many workshop locations throughout 2012, including suites adjacent to Bike Forth and  various locations on 2nd Street, Olive Drive, and downtown.  In February of 2013, DMS signed a lease for a converted storage unit in Tim Spencer Alley.  DMS spent most of spring 2013, cleaning up the facility, setting up Internet, building work benches, acquiring tools, installing security features, and generally turning the space into a functioning workshop.  In June, 2013, DMS began holding an informal open house each Friday.
