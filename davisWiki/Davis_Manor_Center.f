Davis Manor Center is the small bluishgraycolored Shopping Centers shopping center located on East 8th Street. The complex used to be a hideous bright orange color. The secluded location and lack of an anchor is a turnoff for prospective (and current) businesses, despite efforts to revitalize the plaza. It is commonly called just Davis Manor, though technically the name refers to the Davis Manor entire neighborhood. Davis Manor Center opened in 1969.

There was large empty retail space where Ralphs Ralphs Supermarket used to be until it closed down in April 2002. Ralphs (Kroger) holds the lease on the property until 2011 and is currently subleasing to Paul Petrovich, who had been unsuccessful in finding a new tenant for several years. The city zoning rules require a supermarket to occupy the lot but it was clearly not in Ralphs best interest to sublease to a competitor. To make matters more interesting, the center consists of 4 parcels, all with different owners. Two of the parcels share a property line that runs through the supermarket building. The building has been rented out to temporary tenants, such as the Halloween Headquarters. In early 2006, the city decided to waive the supermarket requirement and part of the building was finally leased to Dollar Tree.

The two largest remaining tenants (R & R Thrift and Symposium) both own offsite property and are looking to move. The owner of Party and Vac would like to remain in its location and see the center revitalized. Proposals for the area include demolishing the center and created a mixed use residential area. There is contaminated ground under the center from a long gone gas station that would need to be cleaned up before housing could be built.Footnote(Business and Economic Development Commission. http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/business/BEDCMIN61004DMSCW.pdf Davis Manor Shopping Center Workshop Minutes. 20040610.) Footnote(Hess, Katherine and Stachowicz, Kelly. http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/councilpackets/20031021/10_Davis_Manor.pdf Staff Report. 20031021.)

The center was given its unique paint job in the summer of 2003. Some residents have called it nauseainducing and desired it to be repainted to something actually appealing. Furthermore, Petrovich has said that the color may have driven away a potential tenant to the Ralphs lot. Others claim that the colors add dimension and emphasize the buildings forms.Footnote(Curda, Beth. Eyes drawn to Davis Manor. The Davis Enterprise. 20030827.) The yellow and green paint job for the Dollar Tree building has received criticism as well. The Dollar Tree originally wanted a beige theme but the neighborhood and city government chose a more vibrant palette. Footnote(St. John,  Claire. http://davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/08/25/news/133new2.txt Dollar Tree to open in early September. The Davis Enterprise. 20060820.) Although, it was recently changed to a more earthly tone albeit with the Dollar Tree still retaining its bright colors.

Originally, the Ralphs was the original Albertsons supermarket in town. It was sold to Ralphs in 1999. For a short time in 1999, there were no Albertsons in Davis. In the Fall of 1999, Lucky was renamed to Albertsons. Albertsons had purchased the parent company of Lucky in 1998 and then suddenly decided to get rid of the Lucky name in favor of Albertsons in late 1999.

20050226 02:07:57 nbsp On February 19th, I saw some official looking people inside Ralphs. All the lights were turned on. Does anyone know what they were up to? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050623 17:08:32 nbsp Whats with the horrible orange color of the walls? Users/SummerSong
  No idea, but I love it!  Strip malls/complexes are inherently ugly, so its just like fessing up, big time.

20050624 08:36:29 nbsp I think the developers should consider turning this center into an international market! It would provide competition for Cost Plus which I actually do love, and it would be a fantastic onestop for all things international. Saris, a larger Indian food market, entice Kims over there, put in a Mexican market... it seems like a great op to me! Anybody got some seed money?? Friends in high places?? Users/AlphaDog
  Im sure you know about the International Market (middleEastern food) in this shopping center.

20051208 21:08:03 nbsp They are talking about putting the Dollar Tree Store there. Users/HomeDavis

20051223 15:57:24 nbsp If they painted it dignified colors (how about white or tan could be nice), it would not look reviling.  And maybe someone would have moved in.  But in the meantime, whosever idea it was to paint it that color has really ruined part of Davis. Users/JaimeRaba

20060327 17:51:01 nbsp Why does everything have to be white or slightly offwhite? People in other countries arent so http://imagesource.allposters.com/images/pic/CORPOD/CU004710~ColorfulIrishRowHouses.jpg afflicted. Users/SteveDavison

20060428 19:38:50 nbsp There are lots of crazy roaming about. And depressed Als. Users/AlJean

20060429 21:34:30 nbsp What they should do is put a Trader Joes in there.  Boom...revitalize the area, bring in a semispecialty store that Davis has wanted in forever, and be able to support parking for a store like that, all in one fell swoop.  Oh yeah, and paint that hideous thing.
