There is a plethora of Topiaries topiaries in both the complex and in the parking lot.  The topiaries shown in the photo below were removed in 2012, however, there are other topiaries in the complex.

The Davis Medical Center is also a good shortcut for people wanting to cross from Anderson to Sycamore Lane Sycamore as you can cut through the Davis Medical Center parking lot and then continue throuh The Episcopal Church of St. Martin St. Martins parking lot.
