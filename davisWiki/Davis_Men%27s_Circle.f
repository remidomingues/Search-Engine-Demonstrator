Men are invited to a meeting on Tuesday, October 20 at 7:00 p.m. in Davis.

We are a circle of Men who meet and provide a supportive place for men to step more fully into their purpose, passion and authenticity.

We use communication processes that are very well tested and proven in I Groups all around the country for the past 23 years.

We seek to build trust by giving each man an opportunity to say how he feels.

We aim to help each man address the issues in his life in a way that does no harm to other men, and in a way that he is in control of his own work.

We treat each mans words with confidentiality. What you see and hear in the group stays in the group.

We have rules to ensure emotional safety. Any man may pass on any process.
