Midwest Stuff Missing in Davis (or California in general):
  There is a total lack of good Davis Wish List Buffalo Wings, so you have to Hot Sauce make your own.  Also, they dont even have Cheese Curds at the State Fair.  Whats up with that?  I put a recipe for Minnesota State Fair http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurlhttp://moblog.co.uk/blogs/1124/moblog_93a974aafa3b8.jpg&imgrefurlhttp://moblog.co.uk/view.php%3Fid%3D23249&h387&w516&sz31&tbnidVDF5DlhhQLs25M:&tbnh96&tbnw128&hlen&start1&prev/images%3Fq%3Dcheese%2Bcurds%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26rls%3DRNWE,RNWE:200506,RNWE:en Cheese Curds on Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson my page.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

  Cheese curds are available at the Farmers Market, from the same guy who sells the cumin gouda.   Users/JabberWokky jw
    Actually, I was referring to DEEP FRIED cheese curds, which are impossible to find here.  You take the cheese curds like you get at the farmers market, dip them in batter, and fry them in oil. Janelle
      While I can in no way recommend them as I have not had them (nor did I grow up in the midwest where I could get a baseline), A&W now has deep fried cheese curds.  You can find them in Sacramento and other locations.   Users/JabberWokky jw
          Not the same :( but very close!  Users/BrandonBarrette
