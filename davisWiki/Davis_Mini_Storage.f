Davis Mini Storage is one of the businesses that offer Self Storage temporary storage in town.  If you want to talk to a person, its best to call them in the morning.  However, you can leave a message any time of day.

 
   Stuff!  If you got too much and you want to keep it, you need one of the storage units in Davis!




20080808 13:09:39 nbsp I called a few storage places and they were all full (not too surprising, since it is summer).  I lucked out at Davis MiniStorage; they had a 10x10 free, and a possible cancellation of a 5x10.  I called them persistently for two days, and they gave me the 5x10.   The person I met at Davis MiniStorage was Mike, who is semiretired and fixes motorcycles in his shop in the back.  They were very flexible with what I needed, and allowed me to park a UPack ReloCube right near my storage locker to unload it.  Good service, friendly, and accommodating (and seems to be the cheapest in Davis).  Highly recommended. Users/tigerlady
