20080507 09:45:24 nbsp Tony has got some crazy bicycle skills that you dont want to pass up. And hell pick up and drop off your bike, what? He has kept me riding smoothly for years. I wouldnt go anywhere else and neither should you. Users/BreeGee

20080507 11:34:52 nbsp I should also mention that Tony can tune all kinds of bikes. road, mountain, cruiser, antique, bmx, your around town beater... Users/BreeGee

20080507 11:43:54 nbsp I had a great experience with Tony and is providing a much needed service in davis. He was very professional, quick, reliable, and experienced in the field. The fact that he comes to your house for pickup and dropoff is great. He fixed two of my bikes which had a lot wrong with them. He completely did a overhaul on both bikes, cleaning out the bike, greasing the seat and chain, replacing the cables, etc. He called me with a price quote before replacing anything on the bike which I appreciate as I was given the opition to decline certain things that needed to be fixed to cut down on the cost. I am very happy with his services and will call on him again.    Users/ElizabethBarthel

20080508 09:08:16 nbsp Tony did a great job on my bike!  I had a mountain bike that was a wreck, had been left outside for 2 years and I was about to scrap it, and now its back in shape.  The bike runs smoothly, is cleaner than I thought possible and the repair was cheap too! The pickup and delivery were great features, as it can work around my schedule rather than having to make time to drop the bike off. I definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs professional repair at reasonable rates. Users/DanielR

20080509 21:31:41 nbsp Sounds like a great service.  With mobile bike repair you know that its an experienced and motivated mechanic working on your bike, rather than taking your chance with a new employee at some shop. Not to mention the business model is a win/win: It costs less to run, so the savings can be passed on to the customer in the form of better service at the same price. Users/PeterAnselmo

20080515 13:49:27 nbsp Tony fixed up my Diamondback, and was able to fix the gear shifters for a third of the cost that Freewheeler was going to charge to do the job. After seeing how great the bike rode, I brought my Trek to him, and he got the brakes working perfectly.  He picked up the bikes and delivered them...and I didnt have to deal with the bike/repair shops that essentially try to convince you that you should buy a new bike rather than fix your old one. Awesome! Users/RMC

20080515 18:59:40 nbsp Loved how easy this was!!  Since my car is way to small to fit my bikes in, Ive had to bum rides from friends, wait for my bike to be done, or walk home when I needed a tuneup or wheel replacement.  But Tony came to my house, working around my schedule, to pick up my bike.  Not to mention, my cruiser runs so well now!!  I will definitely be contacting Tony in the future when its time for my road bike to get the once over. Users/britany

20080517 19:18:34 nbsp Good stuff. Highly recommended. Picks up, drops off  everything to how you need it to be. Also, very helpful advice, does the little things right that makes a bike run smooth. My road bike was pretty trashed up  he replaced everything and pretty cheap compared to other places. Users/Drewzie

20080528 19:58:46 nbsp The service was top notch! Tony was friendly, had a flexible schedule, and did an excellent job fixing up my bike. Highly recommended. Users/EricLin

20080529 11:58:55 nbsp Tony did an awesome job.  I cut down on my commute time and I no longer squeak and it stops like a charm!  Get your bike in for some needed TLC and you will be rewarded.  Very affordable prices and convenient pick up and drop off. Users/SaraL

20080717 01:02:54 nbsp Tony did a super speedy and great tune up on my bike. He picked it up on Friday night and I had it back Sunday (before classes started on Monday)! The bike was like brand new when he returned it. So clean and rode 10xs smoother than before! I recommend him to everyone!!!! Users/akwiat11
