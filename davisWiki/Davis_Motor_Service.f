20111117 09:16:15 nbsp Topnotch auto repair.  Dont inflate prices like some shops in the Sac area.  Fixed it right the first time, friendly, no highpressure tactics.  Highly recommended. Users/dazer1virginia

20120208 10:03:49 nbsp Went here when my 1993 Volvo 240 station wagon started smoking out of the hood a couple weeks ago.  Dropped it off in the evening and picked it up the next day  turns out the flame trap was completely clogged.  Ivor and company did excellent work and I agree with dazer1virginia that there were no highpressure sales tactics to get me to have more work done  specifically, Ivor let me know that my front shocks were shot but told me that I could have them fixed at a later date.  Its so great to know theres a reliable Volvo mechanic conveniently located in Davis so I dont have to drive all the way to Sacramento for service.  I will definitely be taking my car back here when theres more work to be done. Users/AlexKemperMcCall

20130822 08:36:54 nbsp Wanted to support a local shop, so i called in to see how much an oil and filter change is for a 1995 Volvo 850. Said it was about 125 dollars. Idk about their body work, but dont go for the smaller stuff. Also, if you dont have an appointment, it usually takes longer so i would call ahead. Users/tinybabychelle

20140505 07:41:30 nbsp Have gone here for major and minor fixes on my volvo (suspension job, belt tensioner replaced....). Each time I am extremely happy with the results, things have been running smoothly for 1 year now after they fixed it up and I drive a lot!  Since Ivor will keep the parts that he has replaced and show me exactly what was broken, I always feel great about what work was done. Perhaps a little more expensive per hour than other places, but very high quality work with trustworthy people. Thanks! Users/tobymaxwell

20140724 18:41:40 nbsp All I can say is: outstanding service. Customer is always number one. I was a few dollars short of the final amount for diagnostics and service, and Ivor was very lenient, and made sure I made my way back on the road pronto. I highly recommend DMS for all your automotive needs, especially for Merc vehicles. Definitely saved over a thousand bucks! Users/roysantamar√≠a
