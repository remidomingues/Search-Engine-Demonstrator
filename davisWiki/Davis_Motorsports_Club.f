The Davis Motorsports Club was started in 2005 by Steve Ryan and ... as a way to meet and compete with other Davislocated motorsports enthusiasts.  The clubs principal focus was on participating in motorsports, not just watch it on TV or from the grandstands.  A statement from the webpage read: Originally formed to be just an autocross club, competing in local SCCA Solo II competition, the club morphed into something that encompassed all realms of motorized competition and recreation. In the club we have circuittype racers, autocrossers, dragracers, and show car enthusiasts alike. This diverse makeup allows for a great deal of crossgenre education and opens up enthusiasts to other forms of Driving in Davis automobiledom.  The club was successful in seeing that Davis was wellrepresented at regional SCCA Solo2 events and it increased the participation in trackday events at tracks all over northern California and Nevada.  In addition, one if its members, Ryan Flavell, organized two car shows which were held on the UC Davis UCD campus, an event which there still seems to be interest in.  Club activities also increased interest and participation in karting, both at the http://www.bluemaxkartclub.com/ Blue Max track here in Davis and at indoor facilities in Sacramento.  Eventually the club ceased operating, most likely because key people graduated and moved away.

Back from the Dead, and Growing
In August 2007 Alex Kang set up a new DMC forum.  The original members have been reappearing as word of this gets out, to be joined by many new members. As of April 2008 the club has over 100 members, so now it is entering a new phase where it is developing a more formal structure, sponsored membership options are being explored, the biweekly meetings are going to be less freeform, fund raising and sponsorship programs are being developed, and a number of projects, some small, some quite ambitious, are being planned.  Other notables during the clubs first year back in operation are:

  Registered as a UCD student organization.  So now we have student and nonstudent components to the club
  We had an outstanding float in the Picnic Day parade.
  We have a race car, a 1st gen Mazda RX/7, that members can drive at autox events and which will see action again in the Pro 7 road race series

Like the original DMC, the club is open to all car enthusiasts! People can join by visiting the forum, located just off the clubs http://www.davismsports.com home page.

Motorsports in Davis?
Yes.  While Davis is not caroriented town (Imagewise it isnt, but for all practical purposes it is, although it would never admit it.) there are motorsports people and interesting cars in our fair city.  Ignoring, if you can, the occasional annoying import or American Iron you might see and hear around town, there are some interesting cars here.  At least one new Ferrari, A Lamborghini Galardo, a couple of NSXs, at least a halfdozen cars from the muscle car era, a silver Porsche 356 (pre1964), a green 1930s vintage roadster, a vintage Lotus Europa, a Shelby Cobra replica, a red wagon, and more.  The autocrossers in our town drive cars that look normal, but take a second look and you might notice that it is lowered, is not rolling on your typical street tires, and may even have completely gutted interiors.  Also, UCD has a long running and awardwinning research program (an outgrowth of their 1980s humanpowered vehicle programs that produced a tandem recumbent bike that could reach speeds over 60 mph) where the students either build cars from scratch or modify production vehicles, all geared towards developing more fuel efficient vehicles.  UCD also has a http://mae.ucdavis.edu/~fsae/ Formula SAE club that designs, builds, and races their own cars.  2Bennett Audimotive also builds race cars and parts for Audis.  Davis also has a couple of noted motorsports persons living here, such as Justin Hall (http://www.justinracing.org/?page_id2 Blog, http://www.offcamberracing.com/index.html Offcamber Racing) and Becky Swafford (track record at Blue Max, SCCA club racing, an appearance in the Grand AM series), and probably more.  A club like DMC might be able to bring them out of the woodwork.  In addition to competitiontype cars, look around and youll see a Ford Edsel, classic Mercedes, a Lincoln Continental, a Red Flyer, and more classic and unusual cars.
