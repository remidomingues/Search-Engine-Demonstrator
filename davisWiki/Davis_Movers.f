20090902 21:38:27 nbsp The phone number on this page is actually for University Student Movers, a company NOT situated in Davis. http://universitystudentmovers.com
Unlike what the website says, however, the service is not quick or employing university students. It started with the weird way my phone calls to the number (on this page) went, fyi I had all of the measurements of my furniture and the addresses of where I was moving from and to. First call, I tell my name and when I want to move and the person on the other line says… uh let me get the paperwork and I’ll call you back BYE. And no call back, so I called again but the person on the other line whoever it was continued to act like I was pulling teeth to even make him stay on the line I had real difficulty even giving essential information, they didn’t even know my apartment numbers until the day I moved. I felt embarrassed when I had to call back to confirm the booking, because the person on the other line was so rude.
Then the day came when the furniture was to be moved, they changed the move time to be 4 hours before the time we had agreed upon (and actually wanted to start 5 hours earlier, But I was still organizing my apartment for the move). When they arrived, they lurked around looking at the furniture complaining that they were all so big for a good 10 minutes its furniture in a one bedroom apartment... and complained about getting a trailer even though I had asked for one over the phone and told the measurements of the biggest pieces as well.
Then Shawn/Rashawn (the owner of the company) was rude to me about my decisions about what to do with my furniture (regarding I didn’t want to keep a table, and where I was positioning my furniture in my new apartment). Not to mention, he carried very little from the vans to my apartment. He would just tell his employee to carry everything with a huge attitude and stayed in the parking lot talking on the phone. Making the move last a lot longer, and I paid for 2 movers by the hour not one.
Then I thought it was all over, I gave Rashawn my email so I could get the invoice to pay for the service which I received a few days later, no biggie. But then I see this at the bottom of  email:

“P.S. You have some big boobs, whats up with that?

I’m not kidding. That is real.
So please PLEASE do not call these guys. They’re absolutely horrible!

20090903 21:35:33 nbsp First off, this person (alyssap) is very unstable.  A class III schizoid with little to no interest in the world around her. He mind creates feigned delusions and her cognitive development seems to have stopped around 12 years old. She also has a fixedinterval schedule meaning she redirects frustration and act aggressively toward others characterized by disruptive patterns of thought and functioning. She also seems to have a serious narcissistic personality disorder. As she called us to move her in the middle of busiest moving week of the year… with a two days notice.  Then repeatedly calls “to check ” that we still remember her address and  furniture measurements.

Now let me address some of her distorted thoughts, one byone.

1. Davis movers is part of the universitystudentmovers.com network. A Berkeley student run website. We connect people with a reliable movers in any area. From Boston to Palo Alto.

2. Phone calls are forwarded to local movers in your area. We do not have a call center where people sit around taking orders.  Movers/students are busy people. And sometimes cannot take orders while working and get irritated when you keep calling back with furniture measurements.

3. During the busiest moving week of the year (Aug), we sometime ask customers if we can change a scheduled move time. As many people do not have to be out of their rentals until late or the next day. As the only moving service in Davis with vehicles, we get a lot of people calling in crying and begging us to move them last min.  So naturally, we try to accommodate them.

4. This person was so disorganized; we laterally had to tell her where to put things in her apartment. As we had four other moves to complete that day and did not time to play musical chairs with her dressers.  So of course she found this rude.  We even went back to her old apartment to pick up six chairs we could have taken the first time because she didn’t know if she wanted to keep the table or not. Unbelievable.

Anyway Alyssa P, you should really get some medical help.. and a sense of humor. This company has served thousands of Davis residents and businesses. We work around the clock to continually perfect the company creed and I am very proud of the job we did over the weekend. 34 moves in 72 hours. We kicked ass!  Users/Shawn650
