Davis Muffin City is Davis newest gourmet bakeries muffin supplier! DMC supplies muffins to hungry UC Davis students, and is hoping to expand soon from baskets and carts to a more permanent location. Lovers of greattasting food and masters of baking, Chefs Ian Wilson and John James Dudek joined forces with the intent to craft the perfect muffin recipes, the most decadent and flavorful muffins imaginable. And they succeeded. Though certain muffins will always be available, the duo will continually expand and modify the Davis Muffin City repertoire, adding seasonal flavors and pushing the boundaries of muffinmaking to its absolute limits.

Note from owners: Right now we are looking to get commercial kitchen space so that you can find our muffins in cafes and stores around town. Until then, were going to be selling them straight to you. If youd like to order muffins for an event, feel free to contact us! Well also be wandering around the campus with muffins for sale, so come meet us!

DMC also caters! We are currently offering up four types of muffins with seasonal flavors being added in as well from time to time, and we can always do special orders too.

BlueberryMaple Muffins – A classic with an added twist. The Grade A maple adds rich flavor and a soft, fluffy texture. Together, blueberries and maple are unstoppable!
Banananut Cranberry Muffins – Banananut muffins are good. Banananut Cranberry muffins made with the besttasting bananas are significantly better!
Decadent Chocolate Muffins – Chocolate chips are for chumps. We use organic cocoa powder and accent the flavor with pieces of chocolate from our favorite organic chocolate bars!
Apple Cinnamon Muffins – Arkansas Black apples, Saigon cinnamon, and a hint of nutmeg combine to make a classic muffin better than ever before.

They also said they get free range organic eggs from the Coop here in davis.  Yeah, delicious, responsibly made food! It was such a nice surprise for them to walk by. (: Users/laurengodla
