The Davis Municipal Code is basically the book of laws that govern the City of Davis.

Every time the city council passes an ordinance, that ordinance becomes part of the municipal code. Whether or not the ordinance takes effect immediately is something that is determined on a casebycase basis.

The city council has fairly broad discretion in what laws it can pass, but the councils lawmaking powers are limited by the state constitution and any state laws that supersede municipal ordinances.

If you live in Davis (or even if you visit) you are subject to:

20050527 23:45:13 nbsp Jason, i took a look at the muni codes and your proposed format looks good to me. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050527 23:46:48 nbsp also, what was Ord. #2096? and what did it repeal? Users/ArlenAbraham

Does the City Council pass Municipal Code?  Does it become law as soon as its passed?  What limits the scope of the laws the council are allowed to enact?  How often does it change?
  Ive incorporated my answers to these questions into the top of the page. As far as how often it changes, its really up to how productive the council is feeling. They seem to pass a few new ordinances a year. Users/OscarSabino

20091206 09:34:09 nbsp Just to be pedantic, in addition to the city, county and state codes, we are also subject to codes written by applicable special districts, such as the SacramentoYolo Mosquito and Vector Control District Users/JimStewart
