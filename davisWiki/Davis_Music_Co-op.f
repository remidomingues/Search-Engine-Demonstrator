The Davis Music Coop was founded by Yo Helfman and held its first meeting on 20080516 in Central Park. Its purpose is to bring together the many independent musicians and bands which perform in Davis. Bringing musicians together allows for the pooling of resources as well as networking.


(Note: Lists of bands and local musicians have moved to the website.)
