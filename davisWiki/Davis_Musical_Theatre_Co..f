The Davis Musical Theatre Company (DMTC) was founded in 1984 by Jan and Steve Isaacson (Davis residents since 1977), who, before founding their own company, had participated in productions by West of Broadway, Davis Players, the Davis Comic Opera Co., and other local groups.

DMTC produces six mainstage, Broadwaystyle musicals every year, now shown at their new DMTC Performing Arts Center.

The producers, board and committee members, actors, directors, stage managers, costumers, musicians, and other DMTC participants are volunteer opportunities volunteers. The only paid participant is the pianist, who receives a stipend.

Jan Isaacson also produces four musicals a year geared especially to children in DMTCs Young Performers Theatre (YPT). The YPT showcases the talent of kids 7 to 18 years old. Please visit the DMTC website for show and audition information.  The Davis Musical Theater Company gives out two scholarships each year to graduating schools high school seniors who have participated in DMTC Young Performers or main stage productions.

20100308 06:24:23 nbsp Attended the DMTC production of A year with Frog and Toad this past weekend with the family. It was a packed house and the kids put on a great show that we all enjoyed tremendously.  Tickets were reasonable, the location is easy to get to and this is an entertainment option that we will be pursing much more in the future.  Worth the communities support  Users/loneshark

20140109 22:26:07 nbsp I discovered DMTC on Davis Wiki in March 2013 and was pleasantly surprised at the talent in the production I saw. I am constantly amazed at how accepting they are. Very disability friendly too! The 20132014 season is full of great shows, including Les Miserables and Cats. I expect next season, DMTCs 30th anniversary, to be just as great. The tickets are pretty low priced compared to others in the area (about $7 less).  Users/GAvila
