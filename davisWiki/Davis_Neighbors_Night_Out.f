Davis Neighbors Night Out is a celebration of community. The event seeks to unite neighborhoods by creating an opportunity for all residents to participate in a block party, barbecue, ice cream social, pot luck or other public event. The goal of Davis Neighbors Night Out is to reduce the potential for misunderstandings or conflicts by promoting familiarity and open communication among neighbors. The event, which is scheduled for Sunday, October 11th, 2009 is timed to enable neighborhoods to include new or returning UC Davis students in the festivities.

Student Incentives
In an effort to encourage more students to host events and attend there are a number of student incentives.
     Hosting a party puts you in the running for a free Kaplan course ($1,900 value), a CPR course from the Red Cross ($37 value) and a $25 gift certificate to Yolo Berry. All student party hosts will receive a 2009 DNNO tshirt courtesy of Ink Monkey Graphics and a raffle kit for your student guests.
     Student attendees can also enter to win great prizes, including gift certificates from the Yogurt Shack, Woodstock’s, Steve’s Pizza and InNOut. Other prizes include Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) and Health Education and Promotion giveaway baskets.

There is still time for students to host an event. If you do something like a potluck its easy to organize and city staff will help you.
