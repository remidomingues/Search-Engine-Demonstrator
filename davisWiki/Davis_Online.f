Housing

The housing section was built with Google Maps API, pretty durn popular back in the 2000s. Rental listings were shown on a Google map according to the filter you selected.

Rentals information were shown in tabbed info windows, which will pop up after you click on the little house icon. There are four tabs in each info window: Overview, Details, Photo (if any), Directions (if address is geocodable, all ungeocodable addresses go to the black hole location: 1 Shields Avenue). It is amazing youre reading this level of detail about a defunct website.  Hats off to you.

You could switch to Satellite view and zoom in to see the actual places and their surroundings on the map.
