Davis Open Science is a group that is interested in how the future of science is going to depend on building community and truly sharing knowledge. If you are not that familiar with open science ideas, here are several components that you may relate to:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing) Open Access Publishing: The idea that scientific articles should be free to the public and easily accessed. Including but not limited to full, hybrid and delayed open access models.
  Open Tools: The creation of tools that arent hindered by proprietary ownership ideas. The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open Source software movement is the worlds leader.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data Open Data: The idea that data should be available free from copyrights and patents for the purposes of scientific sharing and reproducibility.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science Open Notebook: A way to share and expose the notebook of the scientist, revealing details that arent normally published so there is no insider information.
  Copyrights, trademarks, patents: Do you know if you actually own your work? You probably dont if created at the University.

The groups purpose will be to build a community for sharing knowledge and resources and to bring together a unified voice on Open Science ideas. The group would encompass three core ideas:

     Community: To build a facetoface community through meetings/gatherings and to build an online community using modern web tools.
     Tools: Sharing of tools, software and expertise.
     Lobby: To form a unified voice that can encourage and influence the University and other governing bodies to adopt policy that favors open science initiatives.

Meetings
We have met informally on the first Wednesday of each month at 5:30 @ the Delta of Venus, but due to sparse attendance we have adhoc meetings when we plan events. Ask on the listserv for information.

Getting Famous Or Getting Scooped?: Risks and Opportunities in Sharing Your Science and Scholarship

Come to this workshop to get the scoop on getting scooped. Getting scooped is a reality in research and this workshop will explore the ways that one can publish successively without the fear of being scooped. We will have three panelists who are experts in the field to answer your questions and lead the discussion. The first hour of the workshop will be devoted to a few short presentations from the panelists and the second to an interactive discussion with the audience. This enlightening workshop will provide a forum to help explore questions such as:
Has someone ever published your results before you did?
Should you fear being scooped?
Have you ever shared your results prepublication and it been beneficial?
Are you in neck and neck competition for funding and your research has to be secret until publishing?


Wednesday, November 30th, 12:002:00

 A Startups Vision for Connecting Researchers: (Mendeley Research Networks cofounders Jan Reichelt and Victor Henning): Tuesday November 16th, 12:30pm, 1062 Bainer Hall.

 Defrosting your digital library: A hands on introduction to Mendeley software for organizing and sharing articles: (Carl and Luke, Davis Open Science):  Monday November 15th, 4:00pm, 2334 Academic Surge Building. If you want to follow along, create an account and install Mendeley on your laptop and bring it on in.  Email dlpeterson@ucdavis.edu if you are coming to this so I can make sure we have enough space in our lab. We want to provide the best productivity and collaboration platform to every researcher, student and knowledge worker in the world  on the desktop, web and mobile. Through the platform, were crowdsourcing the worldâ€™s largest open research database, and we enable everyone to build applications on top of it. In doing so, were helping to accelerate scientific progress, drive scientific discovery, and make research more open.

Open Science Issues Affect Every Discipline
Engineering
 Did you know that the UC Regents own every idea you create while here? Any patentable technology that I come up with at the University is ultimately owned by the Regents and you may only have a right to some of the royalties.
 My published papers are not accessible to the millions of engineers in the world unless they pay to see them or are part of a large Institution that can afford the subscription, even though their taxes paid for the work.
 Proprietary software prevents me from reproducing, verifying or sharing much of the work that other engineers produce without coughing up thousands of dollars per software.
Plant Genetics and Breeding
 Ownership of biodiversity: There are various international treaties, such as Convention on Biological Diversity and the TRIPs (TradeRelated Intellectual Property Rights) of the World Trade Organization, that put limit on exchange of biological diversity, even if it is only for research.

 Ownership of new crop varieties: The US is one of a handful of countries that allow both Plant Variety Protection and the more stringent utility patents. Most of countries only allow PVP. The latter have exemption for farmers and breeders, which allow limited use for specific purposes, especially breeding of new varieties, unlike patents.

20100301 22:36:20 nbsp An open science group that is only open to UCD affiliates? Users/CovertProfessor

20100302 09:09:01 nbsp no, definitely not. The group is open to anyone that is interested in the topic, but we will be physically based in Davis and most likely utilize the campus for events and such. Users/JasonMoore
  Im glad to hear that, and glad that youve changed this page and your openwetware.org page to make the point clearer.  :)   Users/CovertProfessor

20100302 10:06:36 nbsp This is exactly the type of activity that Google hopes to promote with Google Fiber for Communities gigabit ethernet.   Users/KemblePope
    I dont know how much http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing#Open_access_journals this stuff has to do with Googles fiber plans.  I understand the proponents of open access science publishing, but I just dont have too much faith in it or in trying to overhaul the system.  Id much rather see people promoting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open_access_journal HybridOpen Access systems, because I think these are a lot more feasible and a great compromise beginning.  I think the hybrid system is a great goal, though Id think groups such as this would initially push for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_open_access_journal delayed open access systems, as these help keep the bigger journals happy but ultimately provide the information free to the public.  ES

20100302 13:06:27 nbsp @ES Wed love to here about all the different open access ideas. Right now we trying to get some people together and brainstorm about what the group will be and do. Wed love to have some more information on hybrid and delayed open access ideas. Would you be interested in talking to us about these, either through our email list or an upcoming meeting? Users/JasonMoore
     Im a newbie.  I know a teeny bit about some of this stuff and have my opinions, but I think theres probably a lot more people and sources out there that would be far better.  Good luck. users/Edwins ES

20100303 15:26:35 nbsp I added a little logo I originally made up for the openwetware site, just to have some visual there.  Think we could use a better design though, since it doesnt really say anything about open science.  I like the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Access_logo_PLoS_white.svg open lock symbol designed by PLoS to indicate open access and the simple, intuitive icons associated with each of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/  creative commons licenses, maybe theyd give inspiration to someone more artistically inclined then me to make a group logo?   Users/Carl

20110112 00:08:15 nbsp Id be interested in diggeng deeper into this.  Would you be interested in participating in the City of Davis study regarding the Olive Drive Railroad Fence? Users/BruceHansen
