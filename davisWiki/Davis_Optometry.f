20050922 09:14:10 nbsp Neither is my doc, but I took a friend there the other day. The office staff is pleasantly diverse, and Dr. Suzuki struck me as a bit hyper, but very thorough, attentive and friendly. She seemed wellversed on current research in optometry and we never felt rushed. Users/AlphaDog

20060117 14:29:47 nbsp This was my first time going to an optometrist in davis and I was very pleased with the service and exam procedures. The office staff is very friendly and Dr. Busby explains everything and does not mind people who ask a lot of questions. I did not feel rushed and felt like the money I paid was well worth it. Also this place offers students a discount. My exam would of cost $70, but with my discount, only $63. Overall, I highly suggest this place.Seems very children friendly as well with a variety of stuffed animals. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20060118 13:43:40 nbsp I have been pleased with both optometrists  Dr Suzuki is my regular doctor, but I was recently struck with conjunctivitis and seen by Dr Busby on a moments notice.  Both doctors are friendly and professional, with relaxing demeanors.  The office staff also was very helpful.  I agree with the previous commenter that Dr Suzuki is very energetic, but I found her demeanor endearing!  Its been hard for me to find optometrists I really like, and I feel that I truly hit the jackpot with these two. Users/ErinManley

20060423 10:58:26 nbsp If youre coming here for glasses, and want the glasses within a week or two, dont go here.  Theyre so overburdened with the sheer load of patients that you wont get them for over two weeks.  They do, however, have cheap eye exams (arguably the cheapest in Davis) so take your prescription and go elsewhere.  Their glasses arent that spectacular that its worth a 2 week + long wait. Users/QuynhNhuNguyen

20070212 17:52:09 nbsp I saw Dr. Suzuki recently for the first time and she was SOOO friendly. The 10% student discount really didnt do much for me because it was still expensive (mainly because I ordered new glasses and I dont have vision care in my insurance) but Dr. Suzuki and staff are all really nice. I had to wait a really long time but they had a lot of people that day. But like someone said previously, Dr. Suzuki is super hyper and kept referring to me as kiddo and girl but its very sweet and she loves to talk. Users/CourageCowardlyDog

20070814 21:04:50 nbsp I would recommend avoiding this office.  Dr. Suzuki is probably competent, but the opticians are not, and the doctors put profit over customer satisfaction.  To make a long story short, after two months and four return visits, the glasses they made for me never worked correctly.  After each visit, I was made to feel it was my fault (telling me, e.g., that the progressive lenses take time to adjust to, even though this was my third pair of progressives).  This persisted even after I discovered, after having seen another optician, that the frames they sold me had a bridge that was too small.  Finally, after the fourth visit, and after as many interventions on my behalf by my insurer, one of the doctors said that there were numerous other adjustments they could make to the glasses to make them work.  I dont know why it took four visits for him to pay attention, but as he made it clear that under no circumstances were they going to refund my money, I gave up and gave them the glasses back.  So, they have the glasses and the profit they made from selling them to me, and I am out a few hundred dollars.   Users/ScottAlumbaugh

20080229 16:04:13 nbsp Adding my comment of general appreciation for the folks at this office. My experiences there have all been positive. The only negative is that twice it has taken over a month to get my glasses. In both cases the glasses came in with some sort of defect and they sent them back to be done again. I am not sure if I should be pleased about the way they check them or if I should be displeased about how long it takes. I wonder if others have run into that problem with them. Users/WilliamMead

20080630 10:53:17 nbsp Dr. Suzuki helped me today and gave me an eye exam. Great experience, very helpful and informative, never felt rushed, and very friendly. Ill be going back for my next eye exam, and would recommend this place to anybody in need of an eye exam. Also, they gave me a student discount which was pretty cool. Users/William42

20090219 14:54:53 nbsp The phone number on here is wrong. I got some random guy. I double checked 530 7532020 Users/MattCorey

20090316 11:05:44 nbsp When I went the receptionists were kind of irritable at times, but they were still alright. Dr Suzuki rocks. Shes really cool and down to earth and explains things really well. She cares that you understand why shes doing something (very important for me after getting my laser eye surgery) Users/MattCorey

20090402 12:09:54 nbsp Dr. Busby is absolutely wonderful. He takes a lot of time to explain everything and answers all of your questions. He is also very affordable if you have no insurance. He also works at a clinic that treats serious ocular diseases. Overall, I highly recommend him!  Users/JanethN.

20090618 19:39:58 nbsp Dr Suzuki is my favorite doctor in the whole world. She has great stories and makes me feel like I do really well in my vision exams. Ive probably referred 10 people to her. I agree some of the staff is a bit odd.  Users/IrinaChakraborty

20090714 20:29:32 nbsp Busby was great!  However, the staff/reception area people are not the most organized or knowledgeable! Users/davisgirl10

20090907 11:17:37 nbsp Dr. Busby is extremely thorough, patient, and thoughtful with all his patients (I have recommended several others to his practice).  And the level of service and professionalism are beyond reproach. Users/pilotgeek

20091020 09:24:42 nbsp Dr.Suzuki is extremely professional and thorough. The office staff is very nice but they must be understaffed because I always need to follow up with them.  Users/tellsitlikeitis

20091212 16:55:17 nbsp I had the exact same experience as Scott Alumbaugh. You think that you will pay less because they accept the Universitys insurance. Wrong! They charge you for everything the insurance will pay for and then try to pile on even more. There´s a lot of pressure to spend $1000 on eyeglasses. With my insurance I had to pay over $100 and when they glasses arrived they weren´t my prescription. They aren´t even close. I become completely disoriented when I put them on and it is dangerous to drive with them. Doctor Busby just insisted that they were fine (as though he didn´t care at all). After all he already had his money. The man who prepares the frames was also completely rude when I called and tried to straighten things out over the phone. They force you to pay before you receive your glasses and if they are the wrong prescription, you are SOL and they aren´t going to do anything about it. I would avoid this place like the plague.  Users/bradjone

20091213 14:49:16 nbsp Long story: in August, due to the imense summer heat, I fell asleep on my couch downstairs (where it is cooler than my room) and when I woke up my only pair of glasses that I had had for 10 years were gone! I called a bunch of places in town frantically since I couldnt read anything and I was enrolled in a summer session 2 course. Dr. Busby was able to see me first thing in the morning the next day for a new perscription (3 or 4 other places couldnt see me for for 35 days). My SHIP plan was accepted and my regular insurance covered the little bit that went over. The screening went well. I got a good pair of glasses and the only bad thing was that I had to wait 2 weeks before getting my glasses. However, they came in 3 days early (though I couldnt pick it up then). Basically, they called me when the glasses came in, were super helpful, and I will be going there again in the future.  Users/BryceH

20091213 16:15:22 nbsp I have been seeing Dr. Busby for over a decade.  My old optometrist had retired and I needed to find a new one.  A friend recommended Dr. Busby, gave him a try and Ive never left.

From my very first appointment I was impressed with the thoroughness of the exam.  Over the years as my eyes aged, he explained options and gave excellent recommendations.  Yes, I now wear bifocals, but with his recommendations on type of lenses, I had no trouble adjusting.

His office itself is sometimes a little chaotic.  It seems that each year there is a new staff.  Even so, they have been friendly and professional.

20100107 15:51:58 nbsp Dr. Suzuki is very downtoearth,patient,and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed my exam and felt at ease with her. Users/JMK

20100320 15:51:04 nbsp I have been going to this business since coming to Davis for school 6 yrs ago. Both doctors are very down to earth people ,but Dr. Suzuki is my favorite of the two. She is extremely accommodating and friendly. She knows how to make the client feel comfortable.  I have strong eye reflex muscles so dilating my eyes is usually a task, although Dr. Suzuki makes it a breeze. The people at the front desk are super friendly and they have a wide selection of glasses and the staff is very willing to help you pick out the perfect frame. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20110817 08:10:06 nbsp Dr. Busby is amazing! By far the best eye doctor that I have seen. He truly is interested in improving his patients vision, not earning money. He is very current with ocular research and is always happy to answer any questions. I will truly miss him when I move! Users/JanethN.

20140228 18:48:44 nbsp I highly recommend Davis Optometry. They are kind, professional and truly caring. Im on a limited income and have had several negative experiences with medical professionals since I became unable to continue insurance payments and had to go on disability. They can be demeaning, disparaging and make assumptions based on certain prejudices. Not so with Dr. Busby or his people. They strive to keep their costs low and pass that on to their patients.
