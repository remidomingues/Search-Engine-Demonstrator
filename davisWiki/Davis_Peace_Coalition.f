From the http://www.davispeace.org/ web site:

The Davis Peace Coalition is a coalition of diverse groups and individuals that support peace and nonviolence. The Davis Peace Coalition seeks foreign and domestic policies guided by a commitment to peace and justice achieved through nonviolent, democratic means. The Coalition pursues this vision by:

     Educating ourselves, our community and our elected representatives about issues related to peace and justice;
     Keeping peace and justice issues in the public eye, the public discourse and the ears of our Local Politicians elected officials;
     Creating space for voices and ideas that are barred from or not represented in mainstream venues;
     Planning, encouraging and supporting nonviolent actions that promote peace and justice;
     Facilitating communication and coordination among local peace, justice and other interested community groups;
     Connecting with regional, national and international organizations that share our commitment to peace and justice.
