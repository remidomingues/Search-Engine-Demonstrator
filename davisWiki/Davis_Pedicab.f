Davis Pedicab is a new human pedalpowered taxi service in Davis, the first to arrive here since River City Rickshaws went out of business. Every rider is trained and holds a City of Davis license to operate the pedicabs, which are most often seen around the Downtown and UCD Campus areas of Davis on the weekends. The pedicab operators use a tipping system, meaning ride costs are negotiable and based on what the riders think is fair.
