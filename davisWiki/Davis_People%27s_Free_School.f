This will be an intermediate class for guitarists interested in expressing themselves through song composition and vocal harmonies.

Then we will discuss the poetry side, of adding lyrics and integrating vocal melodies that evoke the essence of the chords. Please bring a guitar and a notepad.

A small group beginner guitar lesson with Davis Hiss, an advanced guitar player. Please meet in front of the Yurt at the Domes and bring your own guitar.

 ORGANIZING 

If you are interested in teaching a class, or have general questions concerning the Davis Peoples Free School please contact Elli Pearson at peardaughter@ucdavis.edu

Hello lovely peoples!

Tonight, eight of us met in the Yurt to discuss organizing the Davis Peoples Free School again. We are trying to focus on offering 10 or so classes for Spring and doing them really well. We want to establish a calender on the Wiki as soon as possible so we can start with outreach materials.


When/where/how often would you like to teach your class?


Could you please type a concise paragraph description of your class?

The type of classes will be advertised on all of our fliers, and (assuming it is okay with you) your email will be provided on the Davis Wiki for people to inquire specifically about YOUR class. Others will be handling general inquiries about the school.

We are all entirely to get this going up again!!

Much love and enjoy the sunshine!

The Davis Peoples Free School seeks to create an alternative space to the inaccessible modern educational system by promoting free, accessible, communityinspired and communitydriven education. The Davis Peoples Free School was created out of the Tri Coops Lecture and Workshop Committee in the winter of 2007 with the aim of bringing free and accessible education to the people of Davis. For more information on other free schools, http://www.santacruz.freeskool.org/news.php click here.

 Mission Statement 
Davis Peoples Free School/Mission Statement Click here for our Mission Statement.
 What does free mean? 
  Teachers and the school may not charge except for the exact cost of materials (e.g. the raw metal for a metalsmithing class). Students can pay the teachers with the fruits of the prosperity that their newfound education has brought them. Better yet, pay it forward!
  On events such as fieldtrips for learn how to backpack, all costs (gas, food, etc.) will be shared equally among students and teachers. No additional costs may be charged for teaching, guiding, etc.

 Why Free? 
The point of keeping it free is to ensure that everyone involved wants to be present solely to teach and to learn, and not to deliver the minimum product to be paid. We intend to change the paradigm (at least for a few hours a day) from What can I get out of this? to What can I give? Hopefully, this cultivates a safe space for sharing skills, knowledge, and a good time!

You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.

I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education. They seem to me to be built up on the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think.
