20080830 18:52:23 nbsp We recently had Robin take care of our kitty while we were away for 10 days.  She did an excellent job!  She is accommodating, kind, and communicated with us through out our trip.  She also left a cute picture of him, which we thought was great touch.  And to top it off, our kitty liked her, which doesnt always happen.  We feel safe leaving for a few days now that we have a wonderful pet nanny!   Users/keriH

20120618 13:55:20 nbsp Valued customers.  As of March 2012, I am no longer offering pet sitting services in Davis.  I have relocated from the area. There are some other wonderful pet care providers in the area that can assist you, such as Elizabeths Pet Sitting, Pitter Patter Pet Care & Pet Pals Davis.  Thank you for the wonderful years of service of your pets needs!  I will miss Davis!  Robin Ray Users/rray
