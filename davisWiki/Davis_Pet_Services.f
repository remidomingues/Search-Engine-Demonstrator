20121029 18:23:47 nbsp I went out of town the other week and Davis pet services was fantastic!!
Chardae was very accommodating and great with my kitty. He had an eye
infection prior to me leaving and she administered his meds and his eye was
all better by the time I got back. Im very paticular with who I trust my animals
with, but I would recommend Davis Pet Services to anyone Users/Caseycallahan

20121029 20:40:19 nbsp I was going on a cruise for 4 days and did not want to leave my cat at a pet hotel. I was told about Davis Pet Service through a friend of mine. The owner, Ms. Jones, was very professional and courteous. She visited my cat twice a day and even turned on my lights at night which was an added perk! I would definitely use this service again when I go out of town for the holidays. Thanks again, Davis Pet Service! Users/SaraJue

20121116 10:37:48 nbsp When I lived in Sacramento, Davis Pet Services would take care of my cat Louis and boxer dog Higgins for the many out of town trips that I take during the year. Higgins was always delighted to see Chardae, and I could always rely on my pets to be in perfect condition when I returned (unlike when I had my friends watch them and the cat was suddenly overweight when I got home...).  Overall highly recommended to anyone who is in need of a pet and house sitter.  Users/MaggieDeverter

20121123 10:19:04 nbsp I have an older sheltie (Missy) who has various special needs because of health reasons and its been difficult to find a reliable petsitter to look after her until I found Chardae at Davis Pet Services. Chardae is very professional; she is responsible, friendly and its easy to see she just genuinly loves animals. She handled all my dogs needs perfectly. It was a relief to be able to keep Missy home, as she gets anxiety when shes had to go to kennels. Plus it eased my mind knowing someone was keeping an eye out on my home while I was gone. Thank you so much Chardae; Im so grateful to have found Davis Pet Services! I strongly recommend them whenever you need any pet sitting done!! Users/DanieleLee

20130111 14:42:52 nbsp I had to scramble to find someone to take care of my 1 year old pit mix for two weeks over the holidays and Chardae and her helpers at Davis Pet Services did an amazing job! They took great care of my rambunctious canine and gave me updates while I was away. My dog can be handful and is very strong but they were not phased by him. I definitely recommend Davis Pet Services for reliable, high quality pet care.  Users/KristanReed

20130122 08:57:49 nbsp I would recommend Chardae to anyone living in the Davis region in need of a pet care expert. My large dog had a skin infection that was causing her to lose all of her fur (and she has a TON of fur), that popped up right before I was leaving town. Chardae brushed her and administered all of her medications with more compassion and understanding than I could have hoped for, considering the lastminute notice I gave her of my dogs condition. I will definitely call Davis Pet Services again if I am in need of a petsitter! Users/LindseyHack

20130528 15:46:27 nbsp Davis Pet Services fed our cats for several days while we were away from home in 2012. They did an excellent job, following our instructions thoroughly. They were happy and healthy when we returned. We will use their services again.  Users/PaulMichelson

20130618 14:53:01 nbsp Chardae did a wonderful job taking care of our two cats for 10 days while we were away; she also watered the garden and took care of our birds. She was incredibly responsible and great to work with, sending updates via email throughout our vacation just to let us know our cats were doing okay. She even swept/tidied around the litterbox and the cats food bowls without me asking, which was really thoughtful. I was very anxious about leaving my cats, but Chardae was very trustworthy and I would definitely use her services again and certainly recommend her to anyone. Also her rates are ridiculously affordable!  Users/ClareRobinson

20130726 14:40:46 nbsp I have been using Davis Pet Services for a year now as my work has me often traveling a couple days a week.  Chardae the owner has been great, responsible flexible and most importantly my dog  likes her.  I know that with Chardae coming I  dont have to worry about my pup getting the exercise he needs. Thanks Chardae! Users/Celestes

20130807 19:18:23 nbsp Chardae has been hanging out with our Corgi pup for about a month and a half and is great! Shes been a lifesaver for Max on many afternoon visits and a weekend while we went camping. 10/10, would recommend.  Users/MikeWardII

20140308 22:47:32 nbsp Thank you all for your wonderful feedback! We are happy to be able to provide pet services for such a great, supportive community! Users/ChardaeJones
