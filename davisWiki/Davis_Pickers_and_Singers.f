Davis Pickers and Singers is a loose organization of musicians who meet privately at a home every other Wednesday to share songs on a particular theme.  Music tends to be folkoriented.  Instrumentation usually includes guitars and other strumming/plucking instruments.  It is not a public performing group, although some members have frequently performed in public in various venues.  The group has been continuously active since 1964.
