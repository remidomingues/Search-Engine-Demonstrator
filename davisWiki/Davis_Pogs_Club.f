The Davis Pogs Club, founded by Users/JohnDudek, is a group dedicated to spreading the Games game of pogs to everybody in Davis. The idea for the club arose when Users/JohnDudek realized that the traditional schoolyard game of ages ago, has become completely obselete, due to the fun of other games, that include playing with other things than cardboard circles.
