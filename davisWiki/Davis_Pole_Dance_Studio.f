According to a May 9, 2011 http://theaggie.org/article/2011/05/09/localpoledancestudiogetsswinging article in the Aggie, they offer pole dance, lap dance, and burlesque classes, as well as private lessons.  There are $5 dropin classes at 6pm, 7pm, and 8pm on Mondays and Wednesdays. They recommend not having lotion on for the pole classes, since it can create a lot more friction.

  This is a really fun way to get a good workout.  You can have a great time working out by yourself or with a group of friends. Davis location is opening midApril.  You must be 18+, although it is open to all genders. Users/Tiffee notes that shes had at least one male in every class shes taken.

20120120 23:14:45 nbsp Be careful when coming to this studio. It is extremely small. There are only 6 poles and due to popularity, the classes have been extremely full, like 2 or even 3 girls sharing a pole. There is not enough room to be safe with that many people, I have definitely been kicked. I have also kicked the wall, and Im a short person, so that should give you an idea of how small this studio is.
There is no AC or heater, which can affect your ability to stick on the pole. It it also very dirty in there. I know they try to clean, but when you walk out of there, your feet are black!
Instructors are ok. Some let you go at your own pace and others may encourage you to try more difficult things, which can result in injury. Im not sure if there is a set curriculum, but it doest seem like it.

It IS ridiculously cheap, but far safer to drive to their sacramento location where there is more space, awesome instructors, and its clean! Users/Vero

20120228 23:28:58 nbsp Love this studio!! Ive been to both locations and have taken classes with several of the teachers. At the Davis studio the drop in classes are a great deal! $5 for a class, you cant go wrong. Yes the Davis studio is a little on the small side but as far as I know there are plans to expand it in the future. Ive been going here since August and it has made me so much stronger as well as boosted my confidence Users/KathrynAzarvand

20140119 00:05:10 nbsp The studio, as noted in the comments above, is quite small; there are six poles and it does get a bit crowded, though not consistently. The regular students know how to avoid collisions, but a bit of common sense can get anyone through safely. If one can do that, the class is actually very enjoyable. Theres no AC or heating but, depending on the season, instructors may provide big fans or space heaters. The studio isnt luxurious. One shouldnt have too high of expectations for its appearance, considering the cost. $5 is a deal for students but it doesnt exactly buy the studio a facelift. That is not important, however, as long as the poles are good. Thats what matters.

The Davis studio is taught by former/advanced students of the Sac studio and most of them, in my experience, have been fantastic. My first instructor was Taryn but she slowly had her former students take over the studio for her during the summer (2013) when she moved to Sac. Now there are four regular instructors at the Davis studio who are just as great. Warning: Jamie (Wednesday classes) will turn your muscles to mush. I was one of her first students and I stayed for all three sessions. . .Lets just say I was incapacitated until the following week.

My friends and I have been going to this studio for nearly a year now, so it is safe to say that we love it. Like any newcomer to the sport, I started off with a lot of anxiety and selfconsciousness but I ended my first lesson wanting more. Anyone can do pole, no matter ones size, shape, or age. Women AND men are welcome to participate. I have seen a good number of men attending classes (regardless of gender preference). Many even outperform the women on certain moves! For those who enjoy things like parkour and freerunning, instructors are always more than happy to teach certain moves that would appeal to such crowds and these folks often fair well in pole dance.  :D

Tips from regulars and pole vets:
Wear shortsleeved shirts and shorts(the shorter the better and you can get a pair of yoga shorts from Target for cheap).
Come dressed in your pole clothes; there is NO CHANGING ROOM.
DO NOT moisturize before going to pole or, if you have already put lotion on, be sure to thoroughly rinse it off before class, otherwise youll slip and slide and that can get dangerous.
Though a limited amount will be provided, bring plenty of water.
Dance with bare feet. Dont bring your own shoes. The studio has heels more suitable for pole dancing if you wish to try them.
