The Davis Police Department Youth Intervention Program can keep an issue in house and not sent to the judicial system. Every juvenile case that comes to the PD is evaluated by the following criteria for suitability for the program:

 1. First time offender
 2. Not Violence violent
 3. Not a Hate Crimes hate crime
 4. No gangs
 5. Juvenile has to admit to the offense

The Program
The program can be creative to fit the needs of the youth. However, some of the things a juvenile would have to do are:

 1. Admit to the offense
 2. Abstain from illegal drugs, gangs gang activity, arrest or Crime crime activity
 3. Make a face to face apology to victim
 4. Make an apology to the parents
 5. Parents or child has to make restitution
 6. 40 hours of community service

If they offend again or the diversion is not working out, the case goes to Yolo County Probation or, if the offense merits, to the Juvenile Justice System Juvenile Court with notation of failed diversion.
