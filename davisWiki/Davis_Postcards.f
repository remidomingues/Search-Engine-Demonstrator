Postcards are a great, inexpensive way to drop a line to the people you care about.  (Parents and immediate family of students especially love this.)  Postcards cost only 27 cents to mail (as of April 2009), and with postcards usually costing less than a dollar, they deliver a high emotional impact for your dollar.
Add any places you know of to the list, and include the price if you know it.
