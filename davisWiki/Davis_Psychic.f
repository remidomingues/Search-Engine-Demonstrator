Located in the almost residential section of Downtown downtown on E Street, Davis Psychic has a very visible billboard on I 80, so it is one of the first things that visitors driving from the east see.  As a result, the Davis Psychic, also known as Paula Marino, is almost iconic of Davis, although few have visited her.  A single session runs from $40 to $60. Available services include tarot readings, aura readings, and crystal gazing.

Paula is originally from Santa Clara, where she says she recognized her psychic talents at a young age. With over three decades of professional experience, she has been the Davis Psychic since about 1990. Her location used to be the home of the Davis Free Clinic (which later morphed into CommuniCare Health Center Communicare).

Information about the Davis Psychic has been difficult to obtain. She is secretive and will readily hang up on people, or deny interviews, even for classes. However, in January 2010, http://www.theaggie.org/2010/01/06/davispsychicdemystifiesclients/ The California Aggie was granted an interview.

One of the joys of Davis (and one of the few not frog related) is the fact that the Davis Psychic has ads at the movie theater.

Once someone wondered what services they offer, to which Users/KarlMogel replied, Charlatanry, of course!.

Many people have heard of psychics being employed by the police in dubious attempts to solve crimes (which works wonders in the tv show http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych Psych). The Davis Psychic, however, knows that there is no substitute for professional crimesolving as demonstrated by the sign to the right.

20060107 21:41:07 nbsp Buying a Hummer is bad enough, since it screams profligacy, but buying a Hummer with funds wheedled out of superstitious students is over the top; this act warrants a mindlessness score of eight (on a scale of one to ten). The irony is sickening: a psychic, presuming to value the immaterial realm above all else, exploits those who believe in the immaterial for the purpose of buying one of the most excessive material possessions on the market. In this regard, the socalled Davis psychic (assuming the Hummer is owned by him/her) also achieves a Philistine score of eight (or maybe the mindlessness and Philistine scales are one in the same).

20060110 09:39:35 nbsp I love the meter wars.  on another note, perhaps the hummer was a clients?  People who might think a GMC jimmy with a boxy exterior is a cool truck might also be inclined to see psychics.   Users/RocksandDirt
  I considered that possibility, but it seems that if it were a clients, then s/he would be practically a livein, since its parked out front almost every time I walk/drive by :) Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20060110 13:10:51 nbsp That first comment scores about a 4 on my centimeterometer. Users/BrentLaabs

20060220 10:51:00 nbsp Ok, Im still trying to find the Hummer.  Can someone enlighten me? Users/GrumpyoldGeek
  You know whats funny? I havent seen it parked in front of the Psychic ever since this whole exchange on the wiki began, although I believe I have seen it driving around town since then (a gray Hummer with people smoking inside). Is this an example of wikipower, or just a coincidence? :) Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20060221 04:45:50 nbsp ZH  Have you considered that the psychic, with his/her powers, has forseen either a) a new, limitless energy source will be developed in the near future, negating the need now to conserve oil or b) the apocalypse is nigh, which also negates the need for energy conservation? Users/ApolloStumpy

20060405 01:12:37 nbsp I called the psychic.  When she asked me where I was calling from, I asked her: dont you know? And she hung up.  Go figure. Users/DavisWikiGnome

20060802 01:10:10 nbsp Honestly, from the story given above about the guy chasing down the photographer, I get an adrenaline rush whenever I stop by to take pictures for this wiki page. Kinda makes me want to take more pictures just to see them freak out. Users/KarlMogel

20061028 20:10:29 nbsp Last week, several cars on 2nd Street were ticketed with Davis Psychic flyers. Now, I dont really care if there is a psychic in Davis willing to take the money of the people willing to give it, however, the line on the flyers that caught my eye was certified. WTF mate? Please point me to the certifier of paranormal psychics, their methodology, and their history. Users/JustinCummins

20081204 14:21:31 nbsp Is he/she really a psychic or just a fortune teller?  Cause mistelling a fortune is simple enough if you claim you dont know when it will happen... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090207 13:18:39 nbsp Has anyone EVER seen this lady?!?!??!?!  Users/JuLuBeez

20120521 16:01:55 nbsp My friend has a palm reading at the whole earth festival recently and said it was really good... I for some reason can never get a hold of her at the number... I JUST WANT MY PALM READ. Users/SharmiBasu

20120614 15:46:11 nbsp I had a psychic reading with Paula recently. I was pretty impressed, and I wanted to follow up definitely, but I am also having trouble reaching her. Maybe she is on vacation? But at any rate, its definitely worth it to speak with her if you have anything youre not sure about or even if you just want to know something for fun :). Shes very nice and has a great sense of humor, but also very informative.  Users/OlyaB

20130603 12:18:08 nbsp Ive been to see Paula a few times, and I mostly had very good experiences. The things she told me made me rethink certain events in my life and reexamine my priorities. Actually, Im thinking about going again soon  I find that she is most helpful when I am going through an emotional time and am worried about a particular thing. She is pricey, but she will let you sit and talk to her for what feels like forever and answer every single question you have! Users/mooodavis
