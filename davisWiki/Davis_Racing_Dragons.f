What is DRD?
Established in 2004, Davis Racing Dragons is a studentrun, collegiate sports club at the University of California, Davis. Our season usually starts during February and ends midNovember, so most of our races are during the summer. But as a regular club, we have socials and events throughout the entire school year. We travel as far as Long Beach to compete. Either way, DRD has gone through legendary exponential growth rates these past 6 years, and its all uphill from here!

What is dragonboat?
The sport originated in China over 2000 years ago, but to this day, it remains a popular, international sport. A dragonboat is a long, narrow boat made up of about 10 rows with 18 to 20 paddlers per crew. Each crew has a steersperson and a drummer and the boat is completely manpowered (thats where the work kicks in), and each row has a leftside and rightside paddler.

How can I join?
Easy peasy. We have general meetings and socials throughout the entire school year. They usually land on every other Thursdays, but meeting locations change every quarter, so shoot us an email and well be more than happy to fill you in on the details.
