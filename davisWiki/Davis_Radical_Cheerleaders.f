Zeestory:

Radical Cheerleading is a feminist performance and Protests protesta kind of intervention in political demonstration (serious) and a subversion of cheerleading (antifeminist). By taking pieces of political protest and sport cheerleadinganarchist cheers and choreographed danceRadical Cheerleading creates unexpected political strategies and bodily acts. The first Radical Cheerbook, published as an independent zine in 1997, introduces Radical Cheerleading as activism with pompoms and middle fingers extended. Its screaming fuck capitalism while doing a split. (pilfered shamelessly from the eworld of radical cheerleaders)

And you:

You will meet us.  The time will come.  The crowd will part and such queer beauties as you cannot imagine will be before you.  The music of our being shall waft down upon your ears and the fruit of inspiration shall be born unto you.  And then one day, quite unexpectedly you will look down only to find a pompom in your fist.  Then, and only then will you know the true meaning of the cheer.
