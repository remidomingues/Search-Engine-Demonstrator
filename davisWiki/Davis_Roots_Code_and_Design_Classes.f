 Davis Roots Summer of Code and Design program 2014 
Davis Roots is offering introductory programming and graphic design classes that are open to anyone who wants to learn. The classes currently offered are an Intro to Python, a fairly simple yet powerful programming language thats perfect for beginners, and an Intro to Graphic Design class which will teach students how to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

All of the classes are taught by industry professionals with degrees in the fields theyre teaching. That way the classes can encompass both the theoretical and practical aspects of programming and design. The goal with both of these intro classes is to teach practical skills as well as how to learn more advanced programming and design skills in the future.

Davis Roots believe that learning how to design and program should be available to everyone, not just to those able to pay a thousand dollars per class. They are working to keep the class costs low and offer small class sizes in order to help everyone learn more effectively.

Classes start on the weekend of April 27, 2014 and end the weekend of May 31, 2014.

Intro to Python and Programming (Saturdays from 105pm):
Students will learn to program in Python and learn the fundamentals of programming which will help them learn more advanced programming languages in the future. The class will have homework and students are required to bring their own laptop to every class session.
