The Davis Sailing Team at UC Davis is a student organizations student organization that teaches Boating sailing with the goal to race competitively against other schools. The Davis Sailing Team sails out of the Lake Washington Sailing Club in West Sacramento (http://www.lwsailing.org link).  We are a member of the Inter Collegiate Sailing Association and race in a competitive circuit against other universities on the west coast such as Santa Clara University, Chapman Univeristy, Univeristy of Southern California, Univeristy of Oregon, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Diego, CSU Channel Island,  CSU Monterey Bay, Cal Maritime, and Cal Poly SLO. New members are educated on the basics of sailing such as, good seamanship, boat handling, and the rules of sailing. No sailing experience is necessary to join. For more information please send us an email.

As a student organization, the Davis Sailing Team receives no financial assistance from the university. Therefore the team is dependent on outside donations and membership dues. Membership is very affordable, it is only $40 for a student to join for the entire quarter. The team makes up the difference in tax deductible donations due to our nonprofit status as a 501c3 organization. We are always looking for donations and sponsorships!
