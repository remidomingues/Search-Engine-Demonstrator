About the Collective

The Davis Seed Savers Alliance is a Community Organizations collective dedicated to saving and sharing seeds among the various gardening communities in Davis. Our vision is to establish a Seed Library and Seed Garden to provide free access to seeds and seed saving knowledge to everyone. We support gardeners and seed savers, from beginner to expert, through the process of growing, harvesting, and saving seeds. We also aim to promote seed sovereignty, and foster cooperation among davis gardeners. We hope to ultimately connect to a larger regional network of seed libraries serving the Bay Area and northern Central Valley.

Past Events!

What is a Seed Library?

It is a depository of seeds held in trust for the members of the library. Members come and borrow seeds for their garden. They grow the plants and let a few go to seed. They collect the seeds and return the same amount or more as they borrowed. Seeds are free to members. The library is both a collection of seeds and a community of gardeners. Since seed is a living thing, it must be renewed each year somewhere by someone or unique varieties can become extinct. Growing one seed and returning it to the library is a valuable contribution.
Check out a few examples of the Bay Area Seed Libraries!

Why save seeds?

Humans have been saving seeds for over 12,000 years. However, in our culture much of that knowledge, along with significant biodiversity, has been lost over the last hundred years. When you grow, save your own seeds and share the surplus, you create a culture of abundance, and you promote seed sovereignty by:

           Increasing the genetic diversity of your own seed stock
           Developing seed stock that is more resilient and better adapted to our climate and soil
           Perpetuating the knowledge and culture of seed saving
           Providing free seeds to everyone


How to save seeds and help your local Seed Library grow

You can find on the http://www.seedmatters.org/engagegrow/startacommunityseedproject/ Seed Matters website useful tips to help you learn how to save seeds, and you can also download for free http://www.seedambassadors.org/docs/seedzine4handout.pdf the Guide to Seed Saving, Seed Stewardship, and Seed Sovereignty. Some very easy plants to save seed from are tomatoes, peas & beans, lettuce, and herbs like basil, cilantro, and garlic chives. Go save some seeds and share the surplus with your local Seed Library!


What about the Seed Garden?

Located in the front part (east side) of the EC Garden, the Seed Garden project offers EC Gardeners and community members a spot to grow plants in order to harvest their seeds. It is an opportunity for gardeners to experiment the joys of seed saving without sacrificing space in their plots. Come and bring healthy, locally adapted and delicious vegetable, flower and herb seedlings to grow in the garden. At the end of the growing season, thousands of seeds will be harvested and shared with the community and seed libraries. We hope the garden will be an important step towards seed sovereignty in Davis.

How can I participate?

 Signing up for our ART project

We are teaching an http://daviswiki.org/Education_For_Sustainable_Living_Program Action Research Team project for the Spring quarter starting April 3. Help us build a portable seed cabinet “Seeds on Wheels” with recycled materials for the Domes Seed Library! We are looking for a userfriendly design with a bike hauling system. Then, reorganizing the seeds, figuring out interesting seed categories and creative labels. We will finalize the project with a seed event introducing the Domies and Davis community to the “Seeds on Wheels” Lending Library. The goal is to provide a convenient and free access to seed everywhere in Davis. The Davis Seed Savers will teach one aspect of saving seed each week. No specific skills are required to participate except enthusiasm and creativity!”

 Volunteering

If you have your own ideas for seed related activities we would love to hear about them. Lets create a local network of seedsavers, gardeners and seed saving stations in Davis! UC Davis students can find here internship opportunities.

We are looking for volunteers to help with:

          seed sorting, repacking and library organization
          organizing seed saving workshops
          organizing seed swaps, seed walks and other fun events!
          participating in the Seed Garden project
          and much more!
