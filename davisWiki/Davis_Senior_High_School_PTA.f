The Parent Teacher Association PTA for Davis Senior High School is an organization of volunteer Parent Groups parents and Teachers in the Davis Joint Unified School District teachers who work together to support the educational programs, student activities and administrative concerns at Davis High. The group meets monthly, typically the first Wednesday of each month in the Davis High School Library at 7:30pm. Anybody with an interest in Davis High School is welcome to attend, and those wishing to speak should contact the PTA president to add an item to the agenda. PTA meetings may include staff & teacher representatives, parent representatives and student representatives.

The Parent Teacher Association is overseen by a volunteer board whose executive members are elected each May to a one year appointment; other board positions, committee members, parent representatives, and IT support staff are appointed. Typically in February, the PTA asks Davis High School parents and teachers to http://www.dhspta.org/join volunteer for positions during the upcoming academic year; in the past the deadline for nominating oneself was early March, with an announcement of the slate at the March PTA meeting and elections held during the May meeting.
