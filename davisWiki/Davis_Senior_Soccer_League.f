The Davis Senior Soccer League, or DSSL, is an adult, coed recreational soccer league, designed for older players, men over 40 and women over 30.  The league sports plays at Playfields Park Playfields Park (in South Davis) on Monday nights, with 7v7 (or 8v8) games set up on half fields across the main soccer field.  Thus, two games are played simultaneously starting at 6:00 pm, 7:00pm, and 8:00pm. There are twelve teams with designated captains, distinguished by their colored teeshirts or jerseys.  It is a lowkey game with no referees, no scores kept, and with an attempt to have at least three women playing per team.
