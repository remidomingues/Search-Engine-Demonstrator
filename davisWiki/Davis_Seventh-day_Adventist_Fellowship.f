The Fellowships Thought of the Year
 We dont always get what we want by running after it 

I have observed that qualities of life like happiness, health, peace and contentment come as the byproduct of other values.  Let me illustrate.  I increase my happiness by helping someone else.  I wasnt trying to become more happy.  My retired neighbor was topping a tree in his front yard.  I went over and helped him take it down.  I came back sweaty and happy.  Amazing!

God offers us the best of life.  If I read Him correctly, I understand Him to say that I find myself when Im willing to lose myself in something greater than me.  I get true rest by taking up His work.  I can soar with forgiveness and serve with compassion and love with abandoned.

Life is an oftentimes upsidedown adventure.  It is best lived with a strong spiritual center.  Join us on lifes journey.

20110214 11:38:19 nbsp To Users/BarnabasTruman: welcome to Earth, the only planet in rebellion against God, and in which God does not do His will. Just look around, read the News and yes you will see that Gods will is NOT done on earth. Thats why the Lords Prayer includes May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. If Gods will was done on earth we would not need to pray for that! Users/Michael777
