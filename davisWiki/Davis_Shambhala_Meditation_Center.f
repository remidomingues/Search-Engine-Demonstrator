The center is affiliated with Shambhala International, which was founded by the Tibetan Buddhist meditation master Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and is now directed by his son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche. The center offers regular mindfulness/awareness meditations as well as meditation instruction; both are free and open to the public.

All are welcome  especially those who wish to practice and study mindfulness, awareness, and loving kindness as inspired by the Buddhist and Shambhala paths.

Ongoing Programs

__Rising Suns Childrens Program__

The http://norcal.shambhala.org/familieschildren/ Shambhala Family and Children’s Programs in Northern California are designed to nurture our community. Offering a space for children to come together with each other and experience their own dignity and bravery, we honor children as fundamentally wise and invite them to be just who they are. We also provide a way for parents to explore their personal practice and personal wisdom by offering children’s programming at the same time as adult programming. We invite parents to explore parenting as path by connecting with one another, attending classes, and sharing this journey with their children.

In Davis, the Rising Suns Childrens Program welcomes children of all ages and their parents.  We meet Sunday mornings at 8:45 at the center to get acquainted.  At 9:00 all are invited into our shrine room for morning chants.  After a couple minutes of meditation time, children and staff are dismissed as a group.  Typically we walk to Central Park or the arboretum.  Activities vary depending on the ages and interests of participants, but include chalk drawing, jump rope, playground games, improv theater games, visiting the ducks or the Demonstration Garden.  Participants return to the Center soon after 10:00 and typically join their parents for family social time in our comfortable library.  The Center is at 2nd and D St., right across from the Odd Fellows Hall.  Take the stairs or elevator up to the second floor above First Northern Bank.  Parents of very young children or those with special needs are encouraged to call ahead of time, but dropins are always welcome.



__Foundations of Shambhala__

Every Monday: 7:00 PM  9:00 PM

Foundations of Shambhala is both a social gathering and discussion group open to all who wish to ask questions and engage in conversation  about the Shambhala Buddhist teachings and our community.  The group provides a setting for fellowship and a free exchange of questions and ideas in a format based on the Native American tradition of the talking circle.  Whether you are a newcomer to Shambhala, a current member or longtime meditation practitioner who wishes to gain more depth and perspective or a Shambhala member from another area transitioning into the Davis Center, this group is a space for everyone.

The Foundations group is hosted by a group of committed meditation students and facilitated by a trained Shambhala Meditation Instructor, and every week the mix of attendees is different, and represents a variety of ages and practice experiences.  During the first fifteen minutes we sit together, and there is a brief guided initial meditation instruction followed by a short period of meditation practice. Meditation is followed by brief selfintroductions and a potluck dinner. You do not need to bring food to attend  theres always plenty for everyone.  After we eat and visit together, we have an open group discussion and also reading material that relates to the core principles and community of Shambhala.  We welcome everyone.

You may have questions or concerns about how Buddhism can apply to your daily life. What is Shambhala? Why do we meditate with our eyes open instead of closed? What is the purpose of chanting? How do I meet a Meditation Instructor? What is the purpose of vows and do I have to take them?  These are examples of questions that come up, but you are free to bring up whatever is on your mind that you feel a need to share.
All of us who participate in the Foundations group find that our understanding and experience of meditation is enhanced by the free exchange of ideas in an open and welcoming environment. Please feel free to join us every Monday night  were here even on holidays.
