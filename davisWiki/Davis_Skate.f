Currently consisting of only a few dedicated skaters, Davis Skate is a weekly tradition which dates back several years, when it was quite a bit more popular.  The group meets every Wednesday at 7:00 PM at the Farmers Market on 4th and C Streets and the skate begins at 7:10, following one of several regular routes through various neighborhoods, Bike Paths bike paths, and Parks parks of Davis.  The pace depends on the level of experience of the group, and any level skater is encouraged to join.  The routes allow for several rest and water stops.  Safety gear is recommended.

Davis Skate has a http://davisskate.tripod.com/ website with information on times and routes.
