What the heck is a SKETCHCRAWL?

Basically, Sketchcrawl is a worldwide drawing marathon. The fearless leader of Sketchcrawlers everywhere (and the guy whose idea it originally was), http://www.enricocasarosa.com Enrico Casarosa, picks a date to go crawling. People in various cities and towns, from Japan to Germany to Chicago to our very own Davis, CA, start madly organizing a route for the day, spreading the word and hoping a large number of people will turn up.

It really isnt a cult.

Its a great way to spend a day: wandering around a town, drawing with a number of other people who also enjoy drawing. Art (unless youre a performance artist) is generally a solitary activity, and its a great change of pace to actually make art with other people who are making art.

There are other good reasons to go Sketchcrawling:

 You get to see how other people draw
 There are almost always people who will give you feedback on your drawings
 Everyones eager to discuss art and how to make it
 Everyones eager also to discuss many other things
 You get to look like a bunch of tourists, but without the cameras
 At the end of the day, you get to go somewhere for dinner or drinks and pass sketchbooks around, which is arguably the best part.

 December 11th, 2005 

There was a Sketchcrawl on December 11th, 2005. We had a great turnout, and although we ended up at about 3 pm with only four people left, we had about 10 people to start out with. Below are some of the drawings produced by our Davis Artists on this Momentous Day:
