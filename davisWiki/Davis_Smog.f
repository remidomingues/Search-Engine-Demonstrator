20060810 16:56:33 nbsp They seem to have changed their hours to close at 5PM on weekdays. Not sure about weekends Users/ErikKlemetti

20060811 08:25:42 nbsp I cant say this guy does poor work, but he certainly has a sullen attitude! Ive commented on his lack of customer service skills to friends and they had similar experiences. Users/AlphaDog

20061012 16:07:14 nbsp These guys keep terrible hours.  Its a Thursday, went to get a free retest on my car, and they werent open at 3:45, despite the hours on the door stating they were open until 5.  Ended up costing me another $75 having to go get the thing tested at another place (EZ Smog, good people there). Not recommended at all. Users/ZacMorris

20070314 17:15:16 nbsp The website, and their coupon, states that hours begin at 8am daily.  Went there yesterday, and a sign on the door said open at 8:30.  Waited until 9:30, and no one showed up.  Finally got the car smogged in Woodland. Users/JohnBerg

20070425 08:00:56 nbsp Davis Smog guys were very nice and I would absolutely recommend them.  Their place is not big, new or fancy, but they treated me with respect and got the job done.  As far as I am concerned, Davis Smog is the only place to go for a smog  test only in this town. I came here after being treated very rude and nasty by another smog place in Davis called EZ Smog.

EZ Smog on 5th Street was not a place Id recommend to my worst enemy.  Very rude and condescending.  They dont have appointments, its a first come, first served but will not take you in order as you arrive as they pick and choose the easy cars to do first.  They wouldnt even tell me if there was another smog test only place in Davis when I asked.

I found out on my own about Davis Smog and I went here instead.  Again, Id recommend Davis Smog.  They are at the far end of the doityourself car wash near the corner of F & Covell. Users/CatAdams

20071103 16:08:34 nbsp Very nice folks. Ive been going there for many years because its test only and best of all they are straight up, no bull. I just went today, a Saturday, around 2:30. I was out by 3:30 with 2  people ahead of me (one was almost done). So with the paperwork and what not, its about a 25 minute process (that may change if the state adds on more test requirements). The 2 people ahead of me passed, so they were happy customers too. My general advice for what its worth is replace cracked hoses, change the oil, oil filter and air filter, inflate the tires to proper pressure and bring it in warmed up to its usual operating temperature. If its been running rough, get a tune up first. Check the Davis Consumers Guide for a coupon. Users/Balder

20080115 17:21:11 nbsp I went to Davis Smog today to get my car smoged.  I had zero problems, it was all very easy.  I got there at around 4:00 on a Tuesday and I didnt even have to wait.  I used a coupon in the Davis Consumer Guide total after the coupon was $60.  They also give you $2 in coins to spend at the car wash next to the shop (they have a vending machine you can use the coins in) I got a soda and a candy bar while I waited. Users/ScottStanley

20080318 17:27:26 nbsp Even though my car failed its smog test, I was happy with my experience here.  I dealt with a friendly young woman who delivered the bad news pleasantly.  They will retest your car for free as long as you bring in your original paperwork.  Cost $66 plus the smog certificate which was $8.75 I believe.  (Since my car didnt pass, I didnt have to pay for the certificate.) Users/AmandaSmith

20080422 23:24:42 nbsp i dont know what all the negative comments are about. i went here today and ive never had an easier, friendlier, or quicker time getting a smog check before. true, the place looks kinda ghetto cuz its so small, but the girl who works there was so nice that youll probably forget your initial impression upon getting there. i was in and out in 15 minutes, dmv got all the info by the time i got home, and i renewed my registration all in one hour. total came out to $60 flat with a printed online coupon i found (http://daviscouponsonline.com/davissmog), which she was happy to take.  Users/beekergene

20080604 12:28:23 nbsp Another positive comment: Showed up this morning around 8:45, armed with Consumers Guide coupon.  Staff were pleasant and professional.  I was out about 20 minutes later. Users/DanLawyer

20090103 20:43:36 nbsp I came right before the new year and was worried that my car wasnt going to pass. I was taken care of as I walked in through the door, greeted with a friendly smile and hello. The gentleman had about 34 cars before mine and it was about 4:15pm when I got there and they close at 6pm, so squeezing me in would be close. He took me anyway and was very pleasant about it. The waiting area was nice and warm, coed bathroom, tv screen as well as a window to watch your car actually getting smogged was great. (You know, I would never leave my car with a mechanic or anything without watching what was done to it, just for peace of mind). Although he apologized for the wait, with the Davis Smog coupon, the price was well worth it. I really dont mind waiting for services: seeing as I waited till close to closing to come in + they treated me like I was their only customer. It definitely was a great experience compared to other locations that Ive been to in Davis & Woodland that either didnt take me because they were in a rush to go home or had a lack of employees working. Oh! They dont charge extra for that new EVAP test that older cars 1995 and older have to get nowadays. Just a note.

Free tokens to next doors carwash was cool too.

While a smog is only necessary every two years or when you sell your car, why not make it a good experience without a worry and go to Davis Smog? Great Service. Great People. Peace of Mind.

20090310 17:35:36 nbsp Friendly and quick (about 25 minutes, Id say). Cost $55 with a coupon. Users/RobertM525

20090518 22:18:07 nbsp Just had a great experience here today. A+ Service. I was in and out in 30 minutes and the technicians are knowledgeable and friendly. Highly recommended. Users/Josh.S

20090724 11:57:29 nbsp Took my car in today. The guy who was going to do the test couldnt reach the pedals sufficiently to finish it. My cars seat does not move. Other than that, they seem fair enough, sullen, but fair. Users/Scones

20090930 12:31:13 nbsp Im not sure what the rest of the comments are about, but the service was timely and polite. The mechanic even talked with me for a little while after my smog, and was as far from sullen as can be. I also saw him alert another customer that his car had loose spark plugs before running the test, and recommended the customer get that fixed and come back. Great service  I would highly recommend it! Users/erlane

20090930 16:09:00 nbsp Consider me a very happy customer of Davis Smog, and greatly appreciative of the efforts of Igor, the technician on duty.  He stayed well past close to get the job done, was friendly and respectful, and even managed to educate me about the process along the way.  I will certainly return for services in the future and recommend you to all my friends and colleagues.  Thank you Davis Smog, with sincere gratitude, again, to Igor. Users/BuckeyeGuy

20100806 13:03:17 nbsp I came in right at closing and the guy could have turned me away, instead did the smog test and accepted the coupon for $20 off.  Great customer service  they do test only, and conventional smog tests and they have my business now. thanks davis smog. Users/NickCarvajal

20100811 09:15:26 nbsp I tried to get my car smogged at Aggie Smog and then EZ Smog, but although I was well within their POSTED hours of operation I found both shops closed. I drove across town to this place and received spectacular customer service. They were willing to honor a competitors coupon when I asked them, too. It took about 1520 minutes, my car passed, and it was an overall good experience. I would recommend this shop to a friend.  Users/DanaMace

20101128 14:26:56 nbsp I had a pleasant experience here today. The man was very friendly and it only took him 10 minutes to smog test my car. Ill be back in two years! Users/EmmyMelton

20110105 14:16:34 nbsp Do not go to this place unless you know for a fact that you will pass. I had my car tested and retested and after paying them, the employee told me that they do not know what is wrong with my car and that i will have to go somewhere else and pay them to retest my car and then pay repairs. I realize this is a test only center, but it would have been nice to know beforehand that THESE GUYS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS. Users/BenAdams

20110112 13:05:40 nbsp Got my Camry smogged today. Polite service, quiet lobby with Wifi. Whole thing took about half an hour, tops, and my total was $75.  I totally forgot my $20 off coupon but thats my problem, not theirs. Ill probably come back if Im still here in two years! Definite recommendation. Users/KBathory


20110117 15:21:05 nbsp We go to Davis Smog whenever we need a testonly station certificate.  A testonly station is not allowed to diagnose or fix your car.  If your car fails at any testonly station, you have to go somewhere else to get it fixed, but the the first retest here is free.  Igor, the guy who did my test last week, was efficient, competent, and helpful. Users/VincentDiCarlo

20110803 21:28:58 nbsp Judging from the reviews, it seems as though your experience with Davis Smog really depends on who is working that day.  I had such a bad experience here today.  They were a little busy (maybe 3 customers ahead of me) and I waited to speak to the woman at the front desk.  She was very short with me and asked me to show her which car was mine.  We walked outside together and I told her I had a competitor coupon  they clearly state that they honor Davis area smog coupons  she said No, thats not our coupon then literally walked away from me to someone elses car while I was midsentence and said Ill talk to you about it later.  I wasnt sure if she was planning to come back for my keys, so I just left.  There are so many places in Davis and Woodland where I can get my car smogged that I just didnt feel like waiting around for someone to be rude to me.  Users/AynReyes

20120516 21:55:48 nbsp My wife took in our 89 Toyota truck for a routine smog test and was told the truck passed all the tests but could not get a certificate because the technician could not read the number on the catalytic converter. He told my wife the retest was free if she could provide a verifiable number. I crawled under the truck that evening and wrote down the number and took the truck back in the next day saying the technician made an error. The owner was abrupt and rude and said he did the work himself and the number was not there. I told him he was wrong and showed him exactly where it was. He replied that since the number was partially covered it was not his fault and that it would cost me half price for a retest. I pointed out his ads saying that the retest was free but he said that did not count for trucks. I said he should at least do a free retest because it was his error that it needed retesting but no amount of arguing would convince him he made a mistake. Then to add insult to injury, he refused to honor his own coupon for a retest. I have had dozens of smog tests over the years with this being my first with Davis smog. I have never had a problem until I went to Davis Smog and I will NEVER go back. There are plenty of reputable smog shops in Davis and Woodland. Use them instead of Davis Smog because Davis Smog is not honest Users/AlanPryor

20120713 17:09:51 nbsp Best magazines in waiting area (National Geographic and Popular Mechanics)! Also excellent, easy service. Users/BenDawson

20130226 13:23:25 nbsp $55 with the Little Green Machine coupon if you add up the cost of the certificate, for a 1996 car. The reviews are helpful and insightful, but what you really is how much youre going to pay. Yes they add coins to wash your car, but you only have 4 minutes to take advantage of the free car wash, which includes figuring out how to operate the machines.  Users/DavisSite

20131218 19:46:04 nbsp I tried these guys out this week and will definitely be going back. The woman at the front desk was nice, and the guy doing the test was helpful, making sure I didnt leave until he got my tire pressure adjusted correctly. Users/PatesBaroni
