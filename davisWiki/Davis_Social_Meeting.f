>The Davis Social Meeting was a Wiki Gatherings gathering of diversely minded People peoples that cared to socialize with each other on a infrequent basis within the city of Davis.<

>Future Wiki Gatherings gatherings are hoped for, but after the first attempt at Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias it is obvious smarter Parties planning is necessary.<

>If you are so inclined to participate, please contribute!<

>__Schedule__<

>None currently<

>Remember to bring in your nonwiki friends to the wiki gatherings; we dont wanna seem like a cult gathering, after all.<

>If anyone wants to suggest somewhere else to hold these functions, please do.  Public parks would be great if not for the current smoke and heat combination.<



20080528 19:15:10 nbsp Yep, people who follow the Recent Changes look at this ohsowonderful page and wonder What the deuce is DaWiSo? Then they wonder if its related to the Davis Wiki BBQs. Then they contemplate if Come one, come all really means what it says, and decide that it sounds like a pretty good idea, and that it might be fun to drop by for a beer. Then they decide that Sunday at 9pm seems pretty late to start a gathering since people have jobs and stuff, but would probably show up anyhow. Users/ChrisLambertus


20080528 21:33:53 nbsp DaWiSo  its like a wikiBBQ, but with greater frequency and without the BBQ Users/StevenDaubert

  That should be our slogan! Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  I love it!  Users/Curlygirl26

20080618 13:57:05 nbsp It probably would help if I personally showed up on time to one of these things... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080618 14:14:02 nbsp Perhaps next time we also designate a way for people to find us.  We pick a place, but we also include some identifier and post it on the site.  Like, we bring some object or bright orange construction paper with Reserved for Wiki written on it.  Well slap that on our table so people wont be looking around wondering if they are Wiki or nonWiki.

I know some people are shy or hesitant to just walk up and ask people.   Users/CurlyGirl26

 This is a very good point. users/JonathanLawton

20080618 17:13:57 nbsp Am I too hopeful to try a meeting the day before summer sessions start? Users/SunjeetBaadkar
 From an outsiders point of view: I think yes, it is a bit soon. I think I might be interested to stop by one of the future meetings, given the terrible season that is Davis summer...although a tiny voice inside me wished that this is less daviswikicentric....
 Yes, too soon. (Im not back in town yet) users/JonathanLawton

20080619 00:21:32 nbsp Can we meet at not a bar?  How about a restaurant or cafe with selfseating (e.g. crepeville, dos coyotes, etc)? Users/JonathanLawton

20080619 00:31:23 nbsp I got stuck working on the 15th, but Im game for the next one, which I see is on the 22nd. I was wondering about how to tell who the wiki people are. It used to be obvious when everyone was a computer geek, but the lines of nerdism have blurred. I can tell you that I will be the fat guy with buzzed hair dressed all in black except for a colored cover shirt, usually red. Ill probably just walk around asking people if they are from the wiki until I get arrested for being a freak. :)

20080619 02:40:06 nbsp Hey, something I might be able to make it to.. anyone need a ride there.. from OC/LA or anywhere else in the southern lands? Users/DavidPoole

20080619 11:14:21 nbsp I like Jonathans idea.  How about we meet over food at Crepeville or somewhere?  And earlier, like dinner time.  Just an idea. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080619 12:32:48 nbsp Im still unsure when Ill get out to the West Coast (for some reason there was a recent flurry of wedding invitations from California), but sometime this fall Id love to make it. Users/JabberWokky

20080619 14:29:05 nbsp Haha, . .Sonny, you are awesome!  I love it! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080626 14:38:59 nbsp Maybe this time Ill wear a hat that has a Dawiso sticker on it (yes, I created stickers).

Side note: Ive caused enough confusion that its rippled into the real world.  Ive had people I newly meet say Hey, youre that Dawiso guy! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080628 10:32:39 nbsp Well, originally I meant for DaWiSo to mean Davis Wiki Society.  Sort of like having a DaWiSo meeting or something.  But its sort of turned into meaning Davis Wiki Social.  I suppose with this summer heat, I could do an ice cream social sort of thing for pretty cheap (giant 10 gallon drums of ice cream arent that expensive).  Ill see about changing the name to get rid of the confusion Ive caused. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080628 11:55:59 nbsp I really like the idea of a potluck bbq somewhere...any ideas? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080713 11:29:09 nbsp So, are people actually going to go to this? Users/MaryLieth

20080713 11:39:18 nbsp So assuming this is still taking place today, how do we spot the other Davis Wiki people?  Will somebody have a sign?

How many people are coming? Users/IDoNotExist

20080719 11:37:53 nbsp Ok, with the repeated failures that is this page, Im gonna give it one more try of organizing a potluck.  Anyone have any tips on how to get people organized? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080719 12:27:07 nbsp I will volunteer to man the grill if we do a bbq. I think the best way to get people to come is to just firm up a date, invite a bunch of friends, and get a core group of volunteers/organizers to commit to being there come hell or high water.  Users/ChrisLambertus

20080719 19:03:26 nbsp Post it in some place that is often checked, with a well defined date, time, and place.  Maybe on the wiki front page.

Id also suggest starting a google calendar with UCD / wiki related events and the ability for guests to post events.  The advantage to this is that the calendar can be subscribed to with anything that supports ical event format, and can also be used in RSS feeds. Users/IDoNotExist
