The Davis Spinners Guild is a friendly, growing group of fiber and Crafts craft enthusiasts. We welcome members of all ages and skill levels. The guild typically meets at a members house on Sunday afternoons: we bring our projects, equipment, mystery fiber for identification, and sometimes baked goods or excess produce from our gardens.

Our members can often be found spinning at the Farmers Market, at the Square Tomatoes Craft Fair, on the The CoOp CoOp patio, or hanging out at the http://www.ravelry.com/groups/dfcknittingandcraftcircle Davis Food Coop Knitting and Craft Circle. If you see us, come say hello!
