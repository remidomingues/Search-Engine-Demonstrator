20070829 11:38:45 nbsp The staff was very poor at communicating and unprofessional. I had to make numerous visits to get the product I ordered.  In the end they finally got it right.  I paid full price and did not receive an apology.  I wouldnt recommend having shirts or jerseys lettered there. Users/sac38696

20071010 12:30:11 nbsp I have been pleased with everything Davis Sport Shop has done.  We do an incredible amount of business there and they are always professional with us, prompt, and fair.  The work they do is also always very good(embroidery/screening).  I will continue to do business there! Users/DECATNF

20071125 12:07:14 nbsp Theyve always been nice. and they just let you shop without the nagging. Users/mikam

20080912 17:41:48 nbsp I agree with the first comment.  I also had to make 3 trips to the store before I had the completed products.  When I got home and counted I was missing a jersey...  There is certainly a lack of professionalism there. Users/Lorne

20080928 21:45:39 nbsp great service, except for the kid sitting in a chair behind the desk who was sleeping.  But the other employee and the owner were very helpful and i have never been let down here! As to the negative comments, i would disagree Users/davismeep

20090528 09:49:37 nbsp This is one unprofessional business.  I brought my sons glove in for restringing so he wouldnt have to break in a new glove for playoff games a few days hence.  I explained this to them and they kept the glove for a few days and couldnt get hold of the guy that restrings.  No calls from them; I always had to call them.  Finally, on Sunday I told them I would be by that afternoon to get the glove and take it elsewhere.  They confirmed they would be open until 5:00.  Got there at 2:30 and the shop was closed because business was slow.  No call to warn me.  Stay away from this shop.  They do not care about their customers.  Maybe they arent aware of davis wike.

20090616 12:48:45 nbsp I recently went in to order a bunch of stuff for the AYSO Select Soccer coaches.  Aaron was very helpful.  The coaches were able to pick up their stuff without a hitch. Users/jimb62

20091125 15:57:46 nbsp They sell the official UC Davis Baseball hats (with interlocking, lower slanted UCD letters) here. The hats they sell are all fitted (I prefer adjustable), but the hats are high qaulity. I bought mine in the spring from Davis Sports Shop. I wear my UCD baseball hat to nearly all of the sporting events on campus. Users/BryceH

20120721 12:20:06 nbsp They are decent people.  Maybe they are not so extraverted.  They have always come through for me.  Never had a problem with their products.  Very good prices on printed shirts and Ts.  Users/davisazip
