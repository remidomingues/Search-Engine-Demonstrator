 Treatment 

Dr. Hartz’s practice has always incorporated an individualized approach beginning with a postural analysis followed by a thorough orthopedic examination of the areas of complaint. Dependent upon the diagnosed condition, Dr. Hartz will tailor a treatment regimen to provide comprehensive care for the patient. Treatment typically consists of moist heat packs with electrical muscle stimulation, along with ultrasound therapy when indicated, followed by manual adjustments to the spinal and extremity regions. Myofascial release technique, trigger point/acupressure therapy, soft tissue mobilization techniques, and manual traction are utilized dependent upon the patient’s specific clinical needs. Treatment also involves instruction in flexibility and strengthening exercises, proper ergonomics, and if needed, supportive devices, to aid in the patient’s active management of their condition.

20081114 14:16:09 nbsp I think hes a wonderful chiropractor. He is very professional as well as knowledgeable and is willing to share that information with his patients in order for them to understand the procedures he is doing. He had a variety of therapy treatments and was very careful to be sure that I was comfortable throughout whole visit. He cares about spending time with his patients and is very helpful with any questions asked.

20100520 08:28:10 nbsp I have been a patient of Dr. Hartz for several years.  I have been going to chiropractors for over 35 years and he is unique in that he incorporates muscle work with the traditional adjustments.  He tries to deal with the problems with the fewest amount of appointments possible.  If you need a chiropractor in Yolo County, he is an excellent choice. Rob Users/RobKane

20100827 03:42:00 nbsp A testament to how good he is, is how seldom Ive had to visit him. I dont have back pain very often, but when I do it can be debilitating. Usually its related to having sat in the wrong posture for too long, or having lifted something incorrectly. Sometimes Hartz takes care of my problem in as few as two visits. His care is comprehensivehe not only does adjustments but he does tissue work, including massage and ultrasound.  He has a warm personality and is very good about explaining what hes doing, where the problem stems from, and recommending exercises. Hes hands down the best chiropractor my wife and I have ever visited, and since my wife has had chronic back pain, shes had to see quite a few doctors. The only reason my wife doesnt go more often is because her insurance plan doesnt cover it, but Hartz does take Kaiser. Users/jedalexander

20111001 15:00:52 nbsp Excellent care and true professional!  I have been seeing Dr. Hartz since summer of 2006, after having received chiropractic care regularly since 1997. Dr. Hartz is thorough, caring and professional; he is not interested in the quick fix that may have you coming back in a short while later, but rather longterm improved health. He is communicative, willing to work with a patients needs instead of a onesize fits all approach, and hes willing to work with your financial/insurance situation so that you get the care you need. So long as I am living in the area, I have no interest in seeing any other chiropractic care providers. Dr. Hartz is a committed and involved member of the Davis community and should be utilized as a backcare provider whenever possible!  Users/AmandaSeguin

20111005 18:25:17 nbsp Dr. Hartz is such a good chiropractor, I would recommend him to anyone! He is extremely knowledgeable and professional and does not what I call over treat. He adjusts your spine gently and incorporates massage to help the adjustments stay in place. In my case, he suspected degeneration and suggested that I see an orthopedist for XRays and MRI which I did. Although I will have to seek additional help for my particular problem, I will continue to see Dr. Hartz as his treatments have helped me immensely. Users/JenniferFoss
