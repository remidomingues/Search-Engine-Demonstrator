In Davis, over 18,000 people posted the video on Facebook, and 64,000 people viewed it in its first two weeks on YouTube.  Mayor Joe Krovoza, a King Hall alum himself, even posted it on his Facebook wall and encouraged Davisites to vote in thehttp://abovethelaw.com/2011/05/lawrevuevideocontest2011thefinalists Above the Law competition.

While the lyrics were written by the male law student who appears in the video, the background music is from Empire State of Mind by Alicia Keys and JayZ. The female vocalist is Jennifer Coombs, a professional singer from the Sacramento area.
