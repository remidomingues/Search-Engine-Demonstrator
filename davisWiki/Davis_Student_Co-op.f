Davis Student Coop will remain open this coming Fall thanks to dedicated students, Administrators, and Student Housing representatives.  For more information, visit the Save DSC page. At this point, we would like people to send in thanks to the people listed on the Save DSC page  for their dedication in working to keep the coops open for future generations of students.

Historic Davis Student Coop, or DSC (not to be confused with the Davis Senior Center), is one of three on campus coops on the UC Davis campus that offer an alternative living arrangement to students, whether they be undergraduate students undergraduate or graduate students, male or female. DSC typically has anywhere from 10 to 12 residents, depending on the number of rooms being shared. Four of the eight rooms in the house have been used as doubles where the other four are singles, with residents each getting a chance each quarter to choose their room and roommate.

Davis Student Coop residents use appropriate technology to create an ecologically sustainable and community oriented environment. We have been growing all organic since 1972. The residents are also known to cook some damn good food. All house meals are vegetarian, usually with vegan options. We make bulk purchases at the Davis Food Coop for staple goods such as flour and grain. We order bulk foods directly from local organic farms. We grow lots of organic fruit and veggies in our garden. We keep a compost pile and a worm bin.  We are caretakers for chickens whom we treat with respect and from whom we receive eggs.

The house itself is rather large with lots of places to chill out.  You may notice on many a fine night a joyous sound coming from the Coops. Music and art are popular among the residents.

The house welcomes applicants to our communal dinners every Sunday through Thursday at 7 pm. Garden parties, starting at 3:30 pm on Friday, are another great way to meet the residents. Visiting often ensures that all residents in the house will get to meet you and accept you into the community.





20060301 22:55:27 nbsp The Davis Student Coop should rename itself to something that describes what it does, unless, of course, it purchases and sells students! :) For example, the Davis Food Coop purchases and sells food. The Twin Rainbows Housing Cooperative provides housing. etc... Users/GrahamFreeman

20070409 I would call it Permaculture Coop since the general idea of the coops is to foster sustainable relationships between people, plants, animals, and the university. Oh yeah, and Ive been living at DSC for two years now and think a name change is entirely possible as weve thought about this before. Derek Downey

20140417 15:49:54 nbsp I lived for a couple of months at the DSC in 1989glad to see the house is still going strong.  Zuni looks like a second or third generation offspring from my two long haired black cats that I had while I was there, their names were Twelve and Thirteen. Users/lynnmichele
