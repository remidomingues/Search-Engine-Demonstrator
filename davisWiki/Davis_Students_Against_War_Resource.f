This organization is a successor to Davis Students Against War


Overview

Please Note:
in the past there has been an organization referred to as the Davis Students Against War, under the leadership of Karl Duesterberg. That organization has since fallen out and become inactive. THIS PAGE is not in reference to the old DSAW! The Current DSAWR was created in March of 2007 and is organized by Users/KatieDavalos and Juliana Haber. The new organization refers to itself as the Davis Students Against War Resource, due to its networkstatus. It does not identify as democratic or liberal.


Davis Students Against War Resource, or DSAWR, is a student effort to voice the youths opposition to war, including current and future conflict. It is a network for the exchange of information in collaborative efforts by Davis youth. Davis Students Against War is a tool for the contact and coordination of peace efforts. We hope to inspire action in students and seek to create change through awareness. No one person or body represents DSAW and has no affiliations. They are in the process of becoming an official Student Organizations student organization.

Their protests against war include, but are not limited to:
  compiling Davis Students Against War Resource/Iraq War facts about the war in Iraq
  the impact on global environment
  the misallocation of funds
  the lack of citizen and foreign support
  the economic disparities that are inflicted or manipulated by the wagers of war
  the ignorance of global standards of human rights and peace
and specifically:
  the impact of war on students
  the legality of the Iraq War and
  the misrepresentation of information by government and media sources

Their forms of action to create change include: petitions, rallies, protests, boycotts, walkouts, days of silence, and guest speakers.

DSAWR encourages members to speak about their thoughts and share opinions both within the network and among their peers. The goal of DSAW is to proliferate information and discussion regarding war. All suggestions and help is encouraged and welcomed to further the cause.
