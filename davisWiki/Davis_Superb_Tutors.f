20100612 21:14:15 nbsp I first used Superb Tutors in San Diego when I went to Summer School at UCSD. I was VERY impressed with my tutor and the company in general( started by a UCSD graduate who is now a Stanford grad student, hes only 26!), so when I was looking for a tutor up here I was really happy to see that they had expanded into Davis. In general the tutors are super accommodating and willing to meet you on campus, off campus, or even at your house. The prices are reasonable especially when you buy a package(which I recommend since if you need tutoring the more the better), and they are quick to respond to any questions about payment or any thing else. Another great thing is that almost all the tutors are pretty young(grad students etc), so a lot of them have taken the classes they are tutoring you in the last couple years(sometimes even the same prof!) or have TAd for the class, so they always know whats expected in the classes they tutor for.
Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Superb Tutors for any tutoring needs! Users/AmandaD
