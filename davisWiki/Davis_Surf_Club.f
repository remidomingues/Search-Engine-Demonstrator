Mostly UC Davis students, this surfing surf Student Organizations club is considerably active considering that the best, and the only, surfing is over an hour adventures outside of davis away. Check out their great locally owned websites website for ride share info, conditions and such.

The Davis Surf Club isnt too active on campus, though occasionally you will see them tabling in the quad, flyering, or hear about a party. Last sping they threw a party that they cohosted with SOS and it was the biggest, baddest party of Spring 04.

Otherwise, get your butt outside and do some land based outdoor activities.


On that note I would like to invite UC Davis students to take my surf travel survey.  My name is Tony Marca, a graduate student in the Department of Geography at UCSB. Along with other researchers at UCSB, I am doing a study of surf travel, the first of its kind!, for my Masters thesis.

I am conducting an online of survey of California surfers that will reveal patterns of their surf travel from the year 2005. The survey does not ask for identifiable information nor does it ask you to reveal secrete spots that you surf at in Baja, etc. I am just interested generally where people went during 2005. And if you didnt take any surf trips still take the survey! I am also interested in people who didnt take trips.

The online survey can be accessed at https://csiss.ncgia.ucsb.edu/surftravelsurvey/  Check out the link for more information. The survey should take 10 to 15 minutes.

I hope you all are willing to help me out! Thank you for taking the time to read this. Ciao!
