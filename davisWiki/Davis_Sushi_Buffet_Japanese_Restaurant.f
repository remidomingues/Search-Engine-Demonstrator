Davis Sushi Buffet Japanese Restaurant is an all day sushi buffets buffet located on 2nd Street.

This restaurant is in the former location of Kabul Afghan Cuisine. It was mentioned in a note in the http://feb2008.davislifemagazine.com/kabul/pg6 February 2008 issue of Davis Life Magazine at the end of an article written about Kabul before it closed, saying A Davis Life Magazine staff member met a man at the Second Street site claiming to be the new owner who is hard at work transforming the space into a Japanese restaurant where they will serve an allyoucaneat sushi buffet all day long.

Jonathan Borrayo created their BombBomb Roll.

You used to be able to get a free meal on your birthday here, no conditions. Now you can get a free meal here on your birthday with a party of 6+.

As of March 21, 2008 they had a Notice of Application to Sell Alcohol posted and it is http://www.abc.ca.gov/datport/LQSdata.asp?ID2029380529 on file with the wiki:WikiPedia:California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Davis Sushi Buffet has a less than stellar http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&record_idPR0021904 health inspection record.

Davis Sushi Buffet is known to serve the fish Escolar, or snake mackerel, which is also fraudulently marketed as white tuna, superwhite tuna, or butterfish.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escolar.  This fish is wellknown to cause keriorrhea depending on the person and amount consumed. Keriorrhea is an orangeoily diarrhea caused by wax esters that accumulate in the fish. Escolar is also associated with other digestive issues, including stomach cramps, diarrhea, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and anal leakage.  Although escolar is not banned in the U.S., it is banned in some countries including Japan and Italy. The staff and chefs have openly admitted that this very white buttery flavorful fish they serve is escolar, although in the past the staff has passed it off as superwhite tuna or albacore.


20080321 19:40:51 nbsp did kabul not have a liquor liscence? It says new liscence on the sign, so they are not just transfering it. I thought Kabul served alcohol, but i could be wrong.  Users/MattHh

20080321 21:18:57 nbsp This place will be the end of me. Sushi and buffet are two of my favorite words. Users/MamaLoebs

20080330 22:26:30 nbsp Is the demand for sushi within that particular two block radius really that high? Users/JessicaLuedtke

20080331 12:05:32 nbsp Perhaps someday Davis will get a decent familystyle Italian restaurant rather than a 6th sushi restaurant. Users/JimEvans

20080331 17:56:50 nbsp I really hope this place offers something that Fujis, Juscos, and Nobus dont offer. I LOVE Japanese food, and even Im thinking what JimEvans and others are probably thinking. Id love a Chinese bakery (cheap eats), Hot Pot place, or a sports bar (Dukes was way too far out).  Users/AlvinTsao

20080519 19:04:03 nbsp Although that quote in Davis Life Magazine was made, their new business card states they are not open all day.  I dont remember exactly what it was now, but it was something like Lunch 11am2:30pm & Dinner 4:309pm.  Ill amend this later when I snag a card after work. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080529 01:51:26 nbsp I think the name of the restaurant is a little too on the nose  kind of boring.  Users/AlvinTsao

20080601 13:33:32 nbsp For those expecting something different from the already existing sushi restaurants, DSB will disappoint.  Its pretty much a carboncopy of Fujis, albeit with a nicer dining area.  The fish was fresher, and the service was better than Fujis, but this was on opening day.  If DSB can keep up the level of quality that it had on opening day, then it will easily steal a lot of the Fujis line on the weekend rush. Users/SeatonTsai

20080601 13:39:07 nbsp Grand Opening was really busy on June 1st, 2008.  I celebrated their grand opening with a belly full of sushi.  Other than its boring name, the food was an exact replica of the Fujis Sushi Buffet located around the corner.  It might as well be called, Fujis #2.  The items rotating around the sushi bar in little boats contained the familiar items of California rolls, oranges, fried banana, unagi, inari, tamago, spider rolls, and etc.  Like Fujis, you can order special items directly from the sushi chef such as sashimi and tempura.  I had hoped that this new restaurant would have some unique items that would differentiate themselves from other sushi buffets.  However...the opening of this restaurant might put an end to the long lines that we all dread at Fujis. Users/Magster

20080601 14:36:26 nbsp This place is Fuji Chef 2.0. Super Fuji, if you will. A notable difference is the ambiance which is a universe lovelier and better than Fuji Chef. The restaurant feels bright, clean, and happy. The staff is extremely friendly, as they should be on their grand opening, and as tentative as one could hope. Although the selection seems almost identical, all the rolls have been improved and enhanced. They made them more colorful and presentable, and even though they taste a bit better with the new flavors, its pretty much everything we know and should love. They have everything you can order Fuji Chef, so you lose out on nothing going here if Fuji Chef is full. You can also order sashimi too and its much more appealing and taste just as good, if not better. They even have the sushi boats going around, and you can order just like in Fuji Chef. They have a high definition television above the chefs that play Asian music videos and such, its fitting; they may play sports in the future, not sure. The staff seems to be entirely Vietnamese, which I have no problem with! I recommend this place whether Fuji Chef is full or not. It was time for a change and an improvement, and this is what most people have been waiting for. Chef Henry, the owner apparently, works among his staff in a friendly manner. Someone should try to take a picture with him. This place has a lame name, so my friends and I have decided to call it Chef Henrys, it will catch on. Users/CoreyPham

20080602 14:15:32 nbsp So as if Davis needed another sushi buffet, here comes chef Henry. Ive tried every place in Davis and had to go here to try it out. The food isnt bad. They have sashimi and a couple of unique rolls (Henry and Debby?) The food is about what you can expect at a sushi buffet. Its an upgrade from Fujis but its nothing realllllly special. The sashimi wasnt frozen like it often is at Fujis and seemed fresh but it just opened, so it has to be right? The atmosphere is better than Fujis. Cleaner (obviously) and without that bleach smell. Some other random observations while eating the waiters seemed unhappy and people looked mad...also, there was some strange B.O. smell floating around the restaurant but hopefully that wasnt a worker.

Bottom line, its better than Fujis, better than Nobu, better than Jusco etc, but why? Im going to suppose that this place is where all the disgruntled Fujis workers went to form their own business. No, really. Its pretty funny. Just when you think Davis had all the sushi it could get, here comes Chef Henry to the rescue!!!!!!!!! yeah right.

So overall, its Fujis +1. (I actually feel bad for the established Fujis as this place takes direct aim at their customers....but maybe Fujis can step it up a little...)The place wasnt bad...but lets see if they can keep it up beyond opening week...thats when well really see how good this place is. Users/sushi

20080602 14:58:52 nbsp This place has become my favorite place to get delicious sushi. As restaurants increase their prices, this place offers a variety of delicious Japanese fare at a more than fair price of 12.95. (Right now, its 10% off, so hurry.) The best part about the place is that they offer fresh sashimi, and tons of it to boot. Rolls, tempura, fresh oysters and even egg rolls can be taken off of the boats as they float by. They even do the fried banana much better than Nobu. The staff only makes the experience better as they are very helpful and generous. I never had to ask for a refill once, as it was often taken care of before I even had to ask. The quality of the sushi is lower than that of Zen Toro, but it definitely has a certain degree of quality that makes it better than every other buffetstyled sushi place in Davis. I think this place has the potential to become the new goto place for all you can eat sushi. Soon, we wont have to worry about lines for Fujis, as the lines will be moving to Davis Sushi Buffet. Users/EmileMorales

20080602 22:32:39 nbsp Went here on opening day. My family loved it. Henry (The owner & head chef used to work at Fujis) remembered us right away and started bringing out my favorites, just the way we like them. Overall better experience than Fujis. This is the new spot to fill up. Enjoy!!! Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080602 23:19:01 nbsp This place is basically Fujis, except with better service, cleaner atmosphere, and better looking sushi.  It mostly tastes the same as Fujis did before Fujis started going downhill.  The cooked chicken is, however, a lot better than Fujis ever had it.  Chef Henry has a pretty good setting going on with brighter lights, clean decor, and a plasma TV in the middle of the restaurant.  The way he has the restaurant set up allows for much easier access to the chefs when you want to order food.

Concerning the service, many of the workers are the same people that used to work at Fujis.  Chef Henry himself will take your orders and hes a pretty nice guy.  I dont feel bad for Fujis as far as the location goes... I feel bad for Jusco. Users/BrandonWong

20080604 14:27:11 nbsp With a nicer atmosphere, better service, and food...this place is much better than Fujis. Did anyone notice that the sodas were really flat and gross???? They did refill my drink many times without me asking. Users/jaredfromsubway

20080605 00:31:58 nbsp I went here today with a couple of friends and were pleasantly surprised. At first, we were a little taken aback because there were waiters and hostesses outside trying to lure us inside, but once we went in, it was a really nice atmosphere. The waiters were friendly; a little too friendly sometimes. But hey, thats not a bad thing. The food was almost exactly like Fujis but more fresh. They did tend to use a lot of imitation crab. I saw a waiter there that use to work at Fujis as well as the owner who use to be Fujis head chef. Overall, good experience. They still have the 10% off and our sodas were free too. The waiter said that there was free soda for the first month so go this month. Users/HoYiYeung

20080606 12:50:14 nbsp Its almost 1pm and I just stepped outside my shop to see that there is a line outside this place.  I wonder if that means Fujis will have diminished lines... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080606 17:35:53 nbsp Yeah, my partner and I drove by earlier today (Friday) and there was a line... Then we drove past Fujis and there was no line. But it could just be that more people are trying out the new place. Maybe the lines will eventually even out, who knows. But I have yet to see what this place is like. Users/at86

20080607 03:02:04 nbsp There was a mosquito on our plate, when we told one of the waiters what happened he just said, So, kill it! When my boyfriend asked for a compensation they waiter asked if we wanted another plate. Uhm, its allucaneat. They served teryaki salmon and when I asked them for a hot fresh one, the guy just went around the boats looking for one that was already out there. Great, like I couldnt have done that myself and it was cold.  Users/feichuhuya

20080607 10:26:33 nbsp So I ended up dining here at around 2:20pm (10 minutes before their buffet ends) with the intention of getting a hand roll to go, but they let me know that they just stop letting people in at 2:30pm (although this ended up not being true as I saw some people coming in when I ended up finally leaving at 2:50pm).  So I decided to go for the buffet.  Overall, it was good considering it was a buffet.  I didnt get around to ordering specific items, so I cant properly rate the food.  Generally buffets tend to vary since food could have been sitting out for an indeterminate amount of time and arrive at your mouth not so fresh (as in the case of the chicken I picked off the boat), but if you keep an eye out for when the sushi chef puts a new plate out and stalk it till it reaches your grasp, then you will be delighted with fresh sushi (but even then, it was pretty standard).  There were good plates and not so good plates, so overall, the buffet food was satisfying.  The free soda and 10% off the bill was a rather nice treat since it allowed me not to spend too much money on a new place.  My one gripe is that the bar tables are rather high.  Either that or the chairs are too short.  And then there was the fact that they sorta cramped all the people at the buffet bar sorta tight.  I had just enough room for me to have two plates side by side and a glass of water all next to each other and have about 4 inches to where the person next to me had their meal (my general rule is that a person be given the distance between their elbows when in a seated relaxed position...I was not relaxed).  Also, I had a backpack with me and had it at my feet in front of me.  However, there was no room to grab at it without getting up out of my seat, pushing my chair back, and then uncomfortably reaching down between two pair of legs of the people on either side of me just to get my wallet.  I think next time, if I want comfortable seating, Im going for a table.  But then its a bit annoying having to stand on the sides of the buffet to get each new plate (but maybe thats just me).  On a final note, the ambiance was much nicer than most of the sushi places in Davis.  The music was more than pleasant (I noticed quite a few people humming along to familiar songs) and the table dining area was much more formal than I expected.  I will definitely come back again for the bar, but only if elbow room allows, otherwise you will see me at a table. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080607 12:16:55 nbsp After seeing all the good reviews I was excited that perhaps there could be such a thing as a great sushi buffet. Big disappointment! Exactly the same as fujis except fujis freshly fried their soft shelled crab (we got here at 10:45) everything that you order special tastes very premade. The salmon teryaki i ordered was way overcooked. It tasted a lot like gordons fisherman type fillets you will find in your safeway freezer section. The sashimi was about the same quality as fujis. Overall, I want Kabul back because this sushi buffet is exactly a carbon copy of fujis with a little nicer atmosphere. Users/MattHh

20080608 19:30:57 nbsp Uhm...the old lady that ALWAYS stand in front door is pretty kinda scary, how she lures you into it. However, the food pretty good, kinda like fujis. They do need to work on their fried bananas. i think it was not ripe yet and they fried it so it wasnt as sweet or they used the wrong type of banana. Also, the fresh oysters werent around when I was there...hmmz...but yea its kind alike fujis. I have mixed feelings about this place.  Users/vietgirlwithappetite

20080608 22:36:48 nbsp As previously mentioned by MattHh, this restaurant is indeed a carbon copy of Fujis; essentially, the menus are almost identical and the quality of food, drink, and service are similar as well. Before people conceive unfavorable judgments about the business proposition of Davis Sushi Buffet, they need to understand the interpersonal feud between the new (as of 04/19/2008  coincidentally after the tax filing period) owner of Fujis, Jasmine Lee, and David Eccles, the brotherinlaw of Chef Henry (Davis Sushi Buffet). People may disprove of the decision implemented by Wendell Tek (the business entrepreneur who financed the start up funds for Davis Sushi Buffet) and his colleagues to open the store in close proximity to Fujis; however, the initial contract to start up the store was between David Eccles and Jasmine Lee because they verbally agreed to sign into a joint venture. However, as rumors about the romantic affair between Jasmine Lee and David Eccles surfaced, Wendell and his colleagues withdrew their funds stating the lack of professionalism from both Jasmine Lee and David Eccles falsely represent Wendell Teks ethics in the business realm. This infuriated David Eccles, whose attitude and method of handling the situation dissatisfied Jasmine Lee; in turn, she abandoned the joint venture contract between Davis Sushi Buffet and her store, Fujis. David Eccles business attorney, who works as the hostess in Chef Henrys restaurant on Sunday and Monday evenings, is currently in the process of filing a new agreement and plan of merger with Jasmine Lee. If successful, David Eccles plans to buy out De Colores next door at 713 2nd Street in order to monopolize the corner of 2nd and G street with more sushi for the Davis community. Users/RichardTrendall

20080609 03:40:20 nbsp The sashimi is super fresh and way better than Fujis. the environment is nice and service is a lot better than fujis. I hope it actually stays this way though...  Users/evelyn10

20080609 16:04:35 nbsp I agree that certain elements were definitely fresher and the seating around the sushi boats gave you much more space than at Fujis. My only beef (besides the fact that its almost a carbon copy) is that they did not have scallops for their sushi buffet. All in all though, I would go to DSBJR if Fujis had a line and vice versa.  Users/AlvinTsao

20080609 16:49:02 nbsp I dont know why anyone would actually expect this place to be so much different from Fujis. The owner, whose virtues are expounded by countless comments above, is evidently a former member of Fujis staff. Unless he brought new exotic items like sea urchin roe, or live crawling shrimp to the menu, I wouldnt put much faith in a socalled Japanese Restaurant which lacks the aura of an authentic Japanese restaurant to begin with, i.e., lack of ENKA music.




One could say that expecting something so exotic as those items Ive just mentioned are out of the scope for a sushi restaurant based in Davis. Indeed, so keep in mind that this restaurant is just that, another Davisstyle sushi restaurant.  Users/AlexQuan

I dont think people consciously expected Davis Sushi Buffet to be so much different from Fujis, but rather not essentially the same with identical menus, price, buffet, etc since theyre located next to each other (literally  they throw their trash away in the same alley!). Users/RichardTrendall


20080609 18:03:57 nbsp bigger water boat conveyor setup than fujis. its like fujis improved version 2.0 Users/mikokuriko

20080609 22:15:55 nbsp As of posting this comment, I have eaten at this restaurant 4 times since they opened. Their food is laced with addicting drugs. 12 Girls Band!   Users/CoreyPham

20080610 01:07:10 nbsp Ate here for the first time yesterday.  It was packed, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Not bad considering it was around 1pm.  Could never get away with that short of a wait at Fugis.  Speaking of Fugis, it is similar to Fugis (just as everyone has already pointed out).  People say that as though it were a bad thing.  So what?  Its like Fugis.  Fugis is the only place of its kind in the area.  How many sushi places offer a decent buffet for that price?  Not many.  And while there are a few sushi places, they are $$$.  Now we have two in Davis.  I say, its about effing time!  I dont hear anyone complaining about all the crappy Chinese food this town has!  Fugis is immensely popular as evidenced by the crazy wait times.  Every day there is a huge line waiting to get in.  Now we have another place to get our sushi fix.  Anyway, the food was fresh and tasty.  They take requests for sashimi or special rolls.  I was impressed by the quality of service.  The staff was super attentive even though it was packed.  We even had a tiny mix up (believe me when I say it wasnt a big deal), but they reduced our bill by 25% anyway.

The only thing I didnt feel was this alleged atmosphere people keep bringing up.  Atmosphere?  Really?  I thought it was exactly like that horrible cafeteria ambience that Fujis offers.  It was packed so it was super loud and people kept bumping into out table and. . .not that great.  I came here for the same reason I go to Fugis:  To stuff myself silly with sushi.  It isnt the atmosphere that has me going back to Fugis.  And thats not the lure of this place either.  Anyway, if you like Fugis, youll like this place.     Users/CurlyGirl26

20080613 12:56:01 nbsp Because of the price, I probably wouldnt go here for a regular lunch.  If you go, expect to eat the buffet because they seem to discourage you from ordering from the menu (menu prices are relatively cheap).  I will say, though, that the food was good (except for the fried banana, which was more soggy than what I typically have).  I recommend this place for group celebrations, dates, unique occasions...  that kind of thing. Users/YupYup

20080613 23:25:38 nbsp Great quality sushi, but they focus too much on fancy rolls instead of nigiri and the simpler stuff. They hardly made any nigiriall they made was sashimi, until near the end of the buffet and they started putting out nigiri (maybe because they needed to get rid of their rice). There is slightly more variety at Fujis. Overall, a good restaurant that will fill you up. Users/ArlenKwong

20080620 04:05:05 nbsp All these people are saying that this place is an exact copy of Fujis, but I disagree with all these statements.  At Fujis, they have their buffet items on the boats and you can order more buffet items if all the plates of sushi that you want are taken (which they most likely are).  At Davis Sushi Buffet, they have their items on boats, but you can order any items on the menu at any time.  They dont limit their buffet to just a buffet menu, their entire menu can be requested at any time.  There is also a person designated to just making custom orders for people.  That combined with the fact that Ive never been served frozen fish here (unlike the many times at Fujis), I dont think Ill ever be going back to Fujis again.   Users/ScarlettYing

20080625 19:52:11 nbsp Went here close to opening time last weekend.  Plenty of seating, no lines at all.  The wait staff was very good, my water got refilled like 7 times, and the sushi chef made sure we had everything we needed.  I enjoyed all the rolls I ate.  The two downsides: 1) they didnt have a very good selection of rolls on the boats that early.  We started seeing more variety towards 11am, but by then I was full.  2) Almost all of their rolls were full of the crab stuff, which I like, but I got tired of it.  I guess this falls under lack of selection.  But all in all, I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely recommend this place over Fujis if you like fancy rolls with lots of sauce (I do).

7/10/08 Addition: Went back a second time, a little later this time (eg. 11:30ish) and the variety was much, much better.  I like this place.  Will definitely return. Users/AlexPomeranz

20080626 13:38:52 nbsp I agree with most of the positive reviews. The only thing Id add is that the pricing here is very reasonable for young kids: free for those five and under, ages 6  12 is half price. Nobu Hiro Nobu is comparable at half price for 5 and up, free under five. Fuji Chef Fuji is $1.25 per year over 3 years old (3 and under is free). I should note that I got the price quotes over the phone, and that Nobu hasnt charged us consistently (in a good waylast couple times out they only charged for the adults). Fuji, by contrast, is very consistent :P . Users/KevinChin

20080629 22:12:56 nbsp I went here yesterday for lunch and it was excellent.  The restaurant had an airy feel to it, which seems to be due to the fact that it is all new, and that there is room to move around inside.  Prices are competitive to Fujis and other sushi places in the area.  I found ordering at the bar much easier here than at Fujis.  Im not sure if Fujis has suffered from their popularity, but in comparison this place surpassed everything I was hoping for.  The sashimi was great, not half frozen.  The service was so good that the water glasses at our table were never even as low as half full.  The bathrooms were clean.  Basically, I dont think Ill be going back to Fujis from now on.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20080629 23:57:52 nbsp nice inviting place. nice people also. great place to go pig out, food was tasty. Users/kelvinkay

20080721 19:35:13 nbsp I prefer this place over Fujis. Sashimi was fresh, and the tempura was really good! Users/llee10789

20080721 23:45:41 nbsp Your meal is on them if it is your birthday.  Thats what the sign says, and it held up when I walked in on my birthday (today) and showed them my ID.  They were friendly, and I walked out full.  Excellent meal for the price of a tip.  (: Users/Angel.York

20080808 09:58:40 nbsp I think the best comment so far was referring to this place as Fujis +1. Thats pretty accurate, though it doesnt say a whole lot. Its quite edible for allyoucan eat sushi and the fish was mostly decent... excusing the partiallyfrozen sashimi I was served (seriously, wtf?).

Id give it a 5 out of 10 or so, which is pretty darn good for all you can eat.

Money aside though, the food is FAR better at Zen Toro, Moshi Moshi, Osaka, Sushi Unlimited, and even Oshio Cafe are all better in Davis. Users/JustinKudo

20080808 10:00:58 nbsp Oh, forgot to mention. The place is painfully unauthentic  we asked a waitress for sashimi and she asked if we wanted sosuma. Its a bit disconcerting when your servers dont know what theyre selling. But that aside, the service was good and friendly, which was a plus. Users/JustinKudo

20080816 17:25:17 nbsp Went there for the first time, and i have to say its probably my new favorite sushi place in Davis.  A little more expensive than the other all you can eat places, but the attitude of the chefs and quality of the sushi makes up for it.  Along with having the best sashimi in Davis, they dont act like they are doing you a huge favor by offering you sashimi.  At Fuji, asking for sashimi means a few minutes wait and not even a nod of acknowledgement from the chef that they got your order, so youre not even sure if youll get it.  At Davis Sushi though, they gladly ask if you would like to order anything, and it doesnt take long at all for it to come out.  Plus, dinner sushi offers snow crab legs and a few other goodies that would make it $25 and up in other cities.   Users/daovis

20080816 19:04:40 nbsp Ive been here exactly  10 times since June.  My comments still stand.  Love this place. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080827 11:43:35 nbsp I tried this place recently.  Id say that the sushi is roughly comparable to Fuji Chef, which has an identically priced sushi buffet around the corner.  Davis Sushi was very crowded  so much so that it was difficult to place sushi orders, even at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs filled my orders correctly, but I also had to place an order in multiple parts (partly through the wait staff), because the sushi chefs were just too overloaded to place orders directly at some points.  The salmon is pretty much identical in quality to Fuji  reasonably tasty, not fantastic, but OK for the price.  Much like Fuji, some of it seemed a tad bit on the frozen size.  Fujis unagi is a bit better (and heated properly), and its much easier to place an order.  The atmosphere at Davis Sushi is a bit nicer than at Fuji.  Im pretty split on which one is better.  Either one is good if you want fixed price, all you can eat sushi.  Neither one is good if you want outstanding sushi  you wont find sushi of the quality that you can get in San Francisco here.  But for what you pay, it isnt bad... Users/IDoNotExist

20080829 15:11:02 nbsp I found it indistinguishable from Fujis, which is either a good or a bad depending on your preferences. That said, I ate one of their big crab legs at dinner, and they were so (unnaturally) salty, that I couldnt finish them. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20080830 15:53:30 nbsp Just came back today and it was very nice! I know its a Fuji #2 because the owner of Fuji sold the old one to other owners and have just opened this joint or as rumored. I really enjoy their Sashimi and their food is always in circulation and fresh. The chefs are really nice and will tend to guests requests. We had to wait, but it wasnt like a terrible wait, it took like 510 minutes top around noonish. They are cheaper than Fujis by a dollar!   Users/MissAmyQ

20080905 12:30:34 nbsp Anyone ever not get the buffet?  If so, what items did you order? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080913 20:52:23 nbsp Its a sushi buffet restaurant so they do not offer other options except for the buffet.

The salmon sashimi is quite delicious and fresh. However, the other fish are not quite up to par. Also, the alienlike green roe on their sushi makes me not want to eat it.
 Users/Pearl

20080923 15:23:07 nbsp This place has improved somewhat.  The salmon is definitely better than it was previously  none of the salmon that I ate recently was frozen or overly cold.  Also, they have added a large LCD screen that, while I was there, was playing an Animusic DVD.  Nice.  Alas, their unagi has gone the other way  from not all that good to seriously bad.  The unagi they gave me was cold and tasteless.  Good unagi should be warm (as it should have just come out of a toaster) and flavorful.  Service has improved somewhat, although it can be difficult to get someone to bring you the check.  If you order a specific amount of sushi, you may get that amount, something close to that amount, or something completely different from that amount.  This means that you may have to order the same thing several times to get the order you originally asked for.

I would currently recommend this place over fuji for atmosphere and salmon.  I would currently recommend fuji for unagi over this place. Users/IDoNotExist

20080929 22:27:22 nbsp I love LOVE this place! Definitely better than Fujis. They even have a side salad bar with edemame, tempura, kabobs, fruits and three sauces. (Now I dont have to keep asking them for these things) Everytime I go here, Im never disappointed. The owner is wonderful and the chefs are nice and accommodating. They always ask me if I need or want anything. I never seem to need to wait to grab someones attention unlike other places. Love the California Spicy Unagi Roll and the Davis Rolls. They even let me order the egg tamago sashimi style! And yes, they improved a lot on their Salmon sashimi. Even my boyfriend thought it was surprisingly well done and hes a major picky eater when it comes to sushi. My boyfriend used to go to sushi Nobu for their salmon sashimi but now, its a no brainer that Davis Sushi Buffet is our #1 choice for sushi buffets. I really cant rant and rave enough about them.

And that picture up there of MissAmyQs table is making me hungry. Mmmmm Davis sushi... Users/KimN.

20081005 17:19:06 nbsp Another great sushi place in my opinion.  I dont do sushi often, so I expected a line similar to one at Fujis.  No line.  They easily accommodated our large group (~14 +/) with a bunch of tables together.  Service was good.  Food was good too.  Lastly, not crowded before 06300700 PM on a weekday. Users/MartySmith

but the lady was nice! Users/alexlee333

20081107 23:06:34 nbsp They seem to offer decent dishes considering their price. Staff is generally friendly and respond promptly to requests. I recommend getting their menu and asking the chef or a waiter for what you want, because they can make a great deal more than what is on the conveyor. Users/Xenophon

20081110 22:35:16 nbsp I went here for dinner after the game on Saturday and was slightly underwhelmed. We were seated at the bar, which was a plus (and it was actually nice not having people reach over you all the time like at Fujis). The staff was very friendly and helpful, and got us our miso soup very quickly (though I had to ask for my sweet potato roll twice and waited 23 minutes for it...I wasnt counting on purpose, I was just trying to pass the time!!). I found that a lot of the food is 1) Fried 2)Saucey or 3)Unidentifiable.  I liked having the prawns and fruit buffetstyle, that was an added convenience. Also, the bathroom was very clean and nicely decorated. Still, I was not happy with the lack of variety (I saw prawns...salmon...maybe spicy tuna?), and the vast amounts of mayo was a major turnoff. Basically, I paid $20 for dinner ($~18 base and ~$2 tip) and I was less than enthused. Perhaps I will try my luck at lunch sometime. I rate this restaurant a 6.5/10.  Users/ArianeMetz

20081127 00:19:46 nbsp i LOVE sushi buffets.  Ive been going to this restaurant for awhile and it looks like the restaurant keeps trying to make these new dishes thats unidentifiable and when i tasted it...it wasnt pleasant. I hope they can stick with one menu and add new food slowly so they dont get overwhelmed by too many food items.  The rolls are really large also, cant fit the whole thing in your mouth and it falls apart. I think they over do the sushi rolls, putting too much stuff on it doesnt make it any better. I think they should simplify their rolls more and itll improve.   Users/vietgirlwithappetite

20081206 02:00:16 nbsp I think this place is great!  9 stars out of 10.  Good price, good sushi.  I dont know why everyone is saying its a carbon copy of Fujis as if Fujis invented sushi.  Really, how many combinations of sushi and sashimi can you make?  Every restaurant out there is 90% the same menu as another restaurant of the same cuisine.  Its just that extra 10% of variation that the restaurant can experiment wiht.  So keep an open mind when you eat here. Users/Edawg

20081206 02:21:16 nbsp Not that Im a sushi expert or anything, but I enjoy eating here. The food is nice (if not a bit pricy come dinner) and the chefs are willing to make anything they have the ingredients for. About the only fault I can find is with their service. Everything is self serve except for drinks. I often find that I have an empty glass of water. Would it hurt to put a soda fountain where customers can use it?  Users/WilliamLewis

20081206 04:20:05 nbsp In response to Edawg, sushi restaurants can vary quite a bit in terms of quality, freshness, preparation, presentation, taste, and price.  Davis Sushi Buffet and Fuji are remarkably similar in all of these metrics.  If you were to go to the Bay Area, you would likely find much higher quality (and higher priced) sushi.  In other places, the sushi is not as good. Users/IDoNotExist

20081207 02:56:14 nbsp Fujis was the original sushi buffet in Davis...Then Davis Sushi tried to steal the show. For a while, Fujis was going downhill but Im glad to say that I think its back on top of the sushi world in Davis. When Davis Sushi Buffet arrived, it was clearly better than Fujis. Exactly the same, just done better. Cleaner, variety etc. However, I think Fujis got the message, and one upped them yet again. They now have a a little more variety with the help of some new items on the menu and have cleaned the place up a bit. Prices are now 12.95 no matter what day of the week you eat for lunch.

After 3.5 years of eating Fujis, I was sad to see it go down and get passed up by Davis Sushi Buffet....But after maybe 1/2 a year of being a fan of Davis Sushi Buffet, Im back on track with Fujis...too bad I wont be there anymore. (

Its gotten better and its THE original. The former owner retired and the new owner seemed really nice and chatted it up a bit before lunch. Why support the idea of Davis Sushi Buffet when it was only a replica of Fujis and simply stole their ideas?   Thats just my opinion. I almost miss the good old days where you had to line up all the way past Ground Zero for Fujis an hour before it opened. It was a little ridiculous but that was all part of the deal.

Stick to the original and dont support the biters. Users/sushi
  Ummm, this sounds a lot more like a review for Fuji Chef than for Davis Sushi Buffet. Maybe if you put wordforword the same thing on the Fuji Chef page...Users/JoePomidor

20081208 20:37:22 nbsp The service here was great during the grand opening, but lately they forget orders such as miso soup. And now also the food quality has been going down, almost to the same level as fujis. Users/timlee87

20081209 10:45:43 nbsp Personally, I feel like this place is wayyy better than Fujis.  Well, not WAYYY better, but its better. Hah.  I like that they have a greater selection!  And at lunch, they even have sesame balls, which totally made my day. THe sushi is okay, its nothing spectacular, but then again, its a sushi buffet so Im not really expecting too much.! Users/renee415

20081214 03:36:28 nbsp I went here with a couple friends, i thought it was better than fuji but still alike, the sushi is not that good since i tihnk they try to prepare it to fast. Still i got a bad stare from one of the workers when i order an all octupus shashimi . and they only gave me 4 THIN slices. Kind of pricy, 13 compared to 11 at Jusco. My opinion, i go to jusco for the price and the quality, Try it! Users/aznstryder712

20081214 20:08:15 nbsp Quite expensive.  Sushi for the sushi buffet is probably the best, quality wise, in Davis.  I like the soft shell crab.  However, I rather drive to the Sacramento area to eat at Mizu.   Users/BenLee

20081214 21:13:55 nbsp just went here the other night. the owner as usual is really friendly. not a big fan of sushi but the variety they have here seems pretty good. i especially like that rice thing in the bamboos. however there was a baby cockroach crawling around on the floating sushi boat. we just watched it crawl from one sushi plate to the other. maybe theres something wrong with me but it didnt ruin my appetite. i seem to have different standards for asian places bc ive been to so many restaurants that have roaches roaming around while growing up. Users/skinnyfatgirl

20081215 11:44:35 nbsp Met some friends for lunch here the other day. For $12.95, I cant really complain, but my experience was interesting to say the least. Every 5 minutes, a new server would approach our table and ask us if we needed rolls, miso soup, a menu to look at, etc. I think overall, 6 different people came to our table offering this and that. What some would call good service we found to be a little awkward and annoying. The staff was friendly, but we just found it to be a little overwhelming when the server started talking to us about his love life and how hard it is being single. The bright LED lights and loud chinese music also contributed to quite an interesting sushi experience. I can go on and on, but overall its not a bad place if you want AYCE sushi for a cheap price. If youre looking for real sushi, you might be disappointed.  Users/BrianBaliwas

20090102 14:54:26 nbsp I love this place, and the fact that its got such a great variety means I will usually go here instead of my other favorite sushi place, Nobu. I will agree, however, that they have an odd blend of music and video on display. Today it was, as I recall, elephants bathing to the tune of Beethovens 9th.  Users/JoePomidor

20090102 15:05:55 nbsp This place has good food, a very polite and attentive sushi chef, and I like the fact that you can order special items off a buffet menu. However, I went there on New Years Eve and was distracted and disturbed by the very loud Abba music videos playing on a huge screen near our table. They also seemed to have as many people on staff as there were customers, which made for too many bored waiters milling around our table. If it werent for the Abba, I would gladly go back. Users/NoraCary

20090122 14:52:43 nbsp When I was there a couple weeks ago, the song Mamma Mia! was playing.  All of a sudden, about half the restaurant was singing along.  One of the waiters even began to dance.  It was the oddest thing.  The couple next to me was swaying back and forth in their seats singing along.  The guy even nudged at me with his elbow to try to coax me into singing along.  I wish I had my camera... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090202 19:30:49 nbsp I dont understand why people always compare the quality of fish from one sushi restaurant to another claiming it taste more fresh or whatever. I use to work at a sushi restaurant and i know that most of them get their supplies of seafood from the same provider if they are within the same general area. I use to sign off for the shipments and the delivery drivers would tell me they still had to hit up the other restaurants in town before they were done for the evening. i doubt all the sushi connoisseurs on here can REALLY distinguish a difference in taste of sashimi or soft shell crab from DSB as opposed to Fujis or vice  versa. Users/MilindIsALiar

  Finally, someone that also worked in the biz that understands! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090204 15:20:59 nbsp I love sushi boats. They are awesome. There is something terrific about grabbing your food as it passes that makes dinner exhillarating...like catching the fish yourself (but with less waiting). The sushi chefs here are always very nice, especially the man who takes your money  but for some reason the bus boy kept grabbing our plates before we were done eating the food on them  from right under our noses! It was like an involuntary sushi diet. The water pourers always look upset that you are thirsty, too.  Users/caitlinpolly

20090208 00:23:25 nbsp Ok, so I was arranging a birthday party/get together, and I was looking for a sushi buffet in the downtown area.  Basically Id heard that Jusco<Fuji<Davis Sushi, so I spoke to the manager at Davis Sushi and he said that Id have to call two days ahead of the day I wanted to have the party to basically make a reservation so they could save seats.  They also said that they would let everyone pay separately, which was nice, as I know some places wont do that.

BUT when I arrived for my reserved time the entire restaurant was packed.  So I walk up to the guy seating people and tell him that I had made an appointment for a large group, and he looks at me confused.  He shuffles through his schedule book, finally finds my reservation, and calls over to who I assume was the owner, and comes back saying that they were sorry, but the owner had forgot about my reservation.  You do NOT forget about a reservation in general, but you especially dont for a reservation for 20+ people!  I had to wait for about 40 minutes after my reservation (50 minutes after I got there) for them to get enough tables together to seat my group.  The only thing that kept me there was several of my friends were running late, so only a small portion had arrived by 8, and I was able to tell the rest of them to come later.  If my group had already been there, I would have walked to Jusco...

As for the food, they did have a good selection if you asked for it, but the stuff in the boats was pretty much a lot of the same 56 things (and a few other things mixed in from time to time), which is great if those are what you want.  In my case, not so much...  The rolls were very good, though, and the warm food was nice for variety.

All in all, while the atmosphere and food were good, the service was questionable to me.  Im still annoyed that they forgot about a reservation for that many on a typically busy night, and for a birthday no less.   Its a place Id try again,  but Im not planning on having any groups there again. Users/apbare

20090214 16:08:38 nbsp I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. When I had called earlier about the free birthday meal, all they told me was that, yes, the birthday person would get their meal for free. What they did not tell me was that you had to be in a party of 4 or more and it was just the 2 of us. However, when I mentioned this when I went to pay, the man was nice about it and gave me 50% off my boyfriends portion. I really enjoy eating here, not a huge variety of sushi, but still delicious enough for me to groan in pain afterwards from eating too much. Also, I love that handrolls are part of the buffet  I love handrolls! Users/AliceW

20090222 19:56:11 nbsp TOO MUCH RICE ON EACH ROLL. makes it really hard to chew. at least they dont oversauce their rolls like fujis though. Users/julpham

20090301 17:38:37 nbsp I went there today which is my 3rd time and I found their overall quality of the rolls and fish drastically went down compared to last year.  Besides salmon, the sashimi was almost inedible as it had a weird, sour, and salty taste as well as soggy texture. Although some claim all the sushi restaurants in Davis purchase their fish from the same provider, the way they preserve and prepare the fish can definitely determine the taste.  Their rolls are okay since tons of sauces overwhelmed the otherwise unpalatable sashimi taste. The Waitress who served us today was unfriendly and impatient. The chefs seemed nice, though. I would rather pay a bit more for other nonbuffet sushi restaurants. Users/kellyM123

20090319 14:21:23 nbsp My best friend and I came here about a month ago.  We love sushi buffets but usually go out to Sacramento for those.  Kinda pricy but I love their sashimi selection. We didnt find out that they served octopus sashimi until a little more than half way through our dinner.  Once we found that out, we kept requesting for more plates of octopus sashimi.  The chef looked kind of irritated like we were requesting it for fun or werent going to finish it or something. LOL. Kinda funny.  Anyway, we loved their sashimi selection so much that we are going to go again today. ) Users/McDonski

20090402 12:06:23 nbsp I debated for awhile whether or not to post a comment regarding my experience at Davis Sushi Buffet today, but besides just being irritated, I also learned of a new rule they may affect others decision of whether to come to this establishment or not. Since it opened DSB has become my goto sushi buffet, however, today when I requested six pieces of ikura (which i have done on almost every visit since they opened) I was informed that there was a limit to two pieces per person. As I had come two weeks prior and been served by the SAME sushi chef at that visit, I asked him if this was a new rule. He said in a rather pissed of manner that this was NOT a new rule. When I told him that I had been coming for awhile and never had this problem, he brushed me off and told me hed make an exception and make me two more pieces. Now, I wasnt angry because I couldnt get the amount of ikura I wanted, but because of this chefs demeanor and how he made it seem like I was a rulebreaker. Im pretty sure this ISNT an actual rule, at least not written ANYWHERE in the restaurant).   Users/AlvinTsao

20090402 17:17:15 nbsp They often give you a different number of pieces than you order, especially if you order a large number of pieces at once.  Ive never heard them say that you cant have more sushi though.  But they do try to limit how much you get at once. Users/IDoNotExist

20090406 11:08:22 nbsp To IDoNotExist, it wasnt that he tried to limit how much I had at once, he flatly told me I was only allowed to have 2 pieces of Ikura per visit, and it was the first time I had been told that.

20090406 16:01:03 nbsp I just went by the health department. They didnt have the full report ready, but I was told this was a roach problem. If anyone wants to check this out further, the complaint ID is co0009718.  Users/WilliamLewis
  Someone needs to write up an entry about cockroaches on the DavisWiki (I may if no one with actual entomology credentials does.). The reason being is that when you talk to entomologists about it (and I do because I happen to be married to one), it is absolutely impossible to keep roaches 100% out of Davis restaurants, specifically because of how the town is situated. With so much farm land surrounding us, there is no lack of suitable places for cockroaches to procreate. You can bring in the best of pest control specialists into your restaurant and chances are the bugs will come back eventually. Now, this is not to say that some places dont keep the pests to a minimum better than others. My only point is that consumers need to keep the cockroach thing in perspective. I imagine every restaurant in town has them. The question is how much of an effort do they make to keep the problem manageable.  Users/condemned2bfree

Apparently Davis Sushi Buffet DID have an inspection on April 2 but there were no violations reported on the yolo page here: http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page118 and there has not been a follow up inspection which I suspect would be required if the findings were severe enough to close them down for the weekend.

20090711 12:00:34 nbsp The food is good... I mean, you get what you pay for. This place used to be my favorite lunch spot. But when theyre really busy, the manager (owner?) likes to help with the food preparation... while wearing his numerous gaudy rings and bracelets.

20090724 02:21:58 nbsp They have a pretty good buffet, but you really have to get there early in order to get the good stuff. Latecomers will notice that a lot of the hot foods have cooled off from sitting on the sushi boats for too long. Aside from that, and the fact that its rather difficult to get the chefs attention if you want a special order, this place is OK. Honestly, I would rather go to Nobu Hiro or Jusco. Users/JoePomidor

20091203 11:54:00 nbsp I love this sushi restaurant. The food is delicious and the buffet is enormous. I especially love that you can order whole rolls of sushi from the menu as a part of the buffet (no extra cost!). The service is good, but stretched fairly thin due to the huge number of tables crammed into the restaurant (fire code violation anyone?). I think the music (and music videos on the big screen over the buffet) is fun, but definitely odd for the restaurants theme.

Try to get there early, the line is usually stretched out the door. It definitely worth it though. :) Users/xochiotomi

20100414 14:02:52 nbsp As an elderly gentleman, I once believed that raw seafood was supremely grotesque. I had only consumed a raw creature once before upon a dare in my youth, and the unbearable quivering of the slithering gelatinous tuna chunk deep inside my gullet haunted my dreams for decades.  But at the same time, I felt a renewed vigor, as if I had absorbed some of its fishy life force.  It was this morbid curiosity that led me to try Davis Sushi Buffet nearly 45 years later.  And I must inform you that I am in love!  The endless parade of years had opened my mind considerably, and although I was at first cautious, by the end of the evening I was slurping down slice after slice of what the Japanese call sashimi.  The cool, crisp taste of raw fish on your tongue is like no other, its chewy tenderness sending shockwaves of ecstasy down my withered body.  I will definitely try Davis Sushi Buffet again sometime.  And I recommend to old and young folk alike, overcome your prejudices about thickness of the slices... its all in your mind!! Users/PhineasJWorthington

20100625 14:26:39 nbsp People should understand a few things about these sushi joints in Davis:
Its a sushi BUFFET. Therefore, do not expect spectacular quality but decent if not mediocre (or even passable) quality. Those who complain of the fish not being fresh have to realize that all of the fish has been frozen and likely been kept for several days (god forbid weeks). I doubt any of these businesses would be able to maintain their buffet system if they were importing fresh fish everyday. Does this fact bother me when I eat there? No. I realize that this is not authentic sushi, nor is it the most fresh. Indeed, the only difference between the fish served here and the packaged variety at Safeway is that a chef has cut and presented the fish for you.

More or less, the food dished out by these many enterprises are edible and depending on your respective tastes, can be quite good, per dollar that is. $12.99 for an allyoucaneat meal of fish is not a bad deal  despite its inherent shortcomings.

20110327 22:29:14 nbsp i ate here for lunch buffet once to try out their offerings and I will not return even though Im not a big fan of sushi buffet in the first place due to the inferior fish qualities. I know buffet doesnt usually have good quality fish but I had to try different places just to see. Needless to say, the lunch sushi I had was pretty poor in quality and left this sick feeling in my stomach when I left. No thanx, never coming back Users/C.Ling

20110402 22:29:14 nbsp I heard of this sushi place from my friend and finally I decided to try it out. The price for lunch is decent consider all you can eat buffet. They do have a large selection of sushi, some are on the sushi boat, the rest you can order from the menu. The service is ok, but the food was delicious, and they do have deep fried oyster which is really good. I will definitely go back. It not the best sushi but it worth the price of around 13.95 for lunch and all you can eat sushi. Users/ChristyPham

20110505 21:48:29 nbsp Most of the maki here has fried items in it and are coated with mayo.  Not super fresh :( Users/bobobb

20110612 22:36:56 nbsp This place is much more lively, friendly and spacious compared to other sushi buffets in Davis. The quality of sushi is similar to other buffets.
But I must note the great service when one of the workers chased us down nearly a few blocks when I forgot my iPhone. Great place. I prefer this place better than Fujis. Users/TraNgu

20110816 17:00:27 nbsp There are no small flies swarming around the fish meat here from my experience. I would go here over Fujis any day...except when this place is full of customers. Users/PaulV

20120106 19:59:58 nbsp Im having trouble understanding the positive reviews of this place. My husband and I brought our kids here tonight to try it out (Friday night at 6pm). First we were told that we had to sit near the door because they were expecting a large group (there were 8 other empty tables). We werent given menus. After a while, we asked if we could see a wine list and order drinks. We were carded and my husband was not served because he left his wallet at home (btw, our kids are preteens and his beard is as white as snow). Then, after my drink came, we were told we could not order off the menu, our meal would be $17.95 per person for buffet only. They reminded us that all 4 of us would pay full price. We felt like they really wanted us to leave, so we paid for our drinks and left. It was one of the strangest restaurant experiences that Ive had. I dont think Ive ever felt so unwelcome in a restaurant before. We had a very nice meal across the street at Tommy Js. Users/Jill.C
 The positive reviews tend to be older. Theyve grown too popular for their location, which is pretty much always packed at dinner. They also have had a few other problems. The constantly rising price of fish seems to have hit them especially hard. Their prices keep on going up and theyre stingier with sashimi, nigiri, and rolls made with sashimi. The allyoucaneat buffet business model has been too successful for their own good. Users/WilliamLewis

20120325 19:43:20 nbsp We went here last nght and the sushi boats were filled with the 2 rolls, both with cream cheese. I frigging hate cream cheese. There was nothing that was on there menu in the buffet. So we got up and left. This place sucks. Go to Jusco or Nobu. Do not eat this crap.

20120418 22:31:50 nbsp The selection of sushi here is pretty decent. While Davis Sushi Buffet doesnt have the greatest sushi ever, it is still tasty and the price of the lunch buffet offers a good bang for the buck. The sushi in the boats tends to be filled with a lot of mayo and cream cheese, but the watermelon and oranges that are offered in the corner are a good way to cleanse the palate. The gyoza and egg rolls in the corner are usually lukewarm and soggy from grease under the heat lamps, but the madetoorder Davis Roll and Y2K Roll are delicious.  Ive always sat at the bar, so I dont know what the service is like at the tables. But where I sit, its easy to ask the sushi chef to prepare a roll and the wait staff is always on top of filling water and clearing plates.  Users/AlexHirsch

20120816 14:13:38 nbsp They changed ownership and the food is 10x better. Users/BingL

20130221 07:15:39 nbsp Note in the overview I have posted info about this restaurant serving escolar, incorrectly also called superwhite tuna by the staff. If anyone has experienced keriorrhea, an orange, oily diarrhea discharge, please comment. I have eaten small quantities of this fish here. I like it, and I havent experienced any bad effects. However this depends on person, amount consumed, and part of the fish consumed (it is recommended you eat no more than a few ounces at a time and eat portions close to the tail) Users/carlislesingensmide

20130305 09:08:37 nbsp Horrible service, tainted food with bacteria (I got sick for two days and my girlfriend was hospitalized from seafood poisoning), also, they are serving prefrozen tilapia making people think it is snapper or yellow fin. This place is the lowest quality sushi I have ever eaten here in Davis. I eat sushi twice a week.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone trying to find sushi, I recommend Zen Toro.  Very overpriced as well 17.95 for dinner makes it one of the most expensive place to eat at in town. Users/ptbernuc

20130305 09:17:32 nbsp Also this place puts too much cream cheese and not enough fish in all the sushis they prepare.  The fact that the sushi is on a boat is cool but it is the most unsanitary way to prepare sushi and have people at the bar that are sick breathing on your food before you serve it to your own table.  This place is all about profit and has no concern for costumers and serving them well.  I would never recommend this place to anyone, every time I have went (5 times total) the food, customer service, and price has gotten progressively worse.  Please do not go her, there food is crap and you will be crapping all night long or hospitalized if you do.  I promise you there are better places to find lower priced quality sushi in town, except on Sundays.

20130426 11:19:51 nbsp I went there last week for the first time.  I will NEVER return.  I picked up a roll of one of the boats and upon closer inspection found a large hair on it, so i set it aside and waited until a waiter could come by so i could let them know.  Before I could mention it i was scolded for wasting food.  After I pointed it out the waiter told me it was not hair, but could not explain what I was pointing at.  I had ordered an ice tea and when i had drank most of it, i looked in the glass and found a dead fly sitting on the bottom of the glass.  I then found a waiter and requested a new glass.  They did bring me a new one, but the glass they brought was dirty.  I would never recommend this place and I hope it gets shut down. Users/JHayes

20130908 16:45:50 nbsp Posted a good review a year ago when they changed ownership.  With my experience last week, I will not return.  Got a dish off the boat, the 1/4 thck rice was cold and hard.  Tried to grab sushi chefs attention since there werent too many people, but he was busy doing something so I ordered a roll through the waiter.  Dragonroll came with minimal fillings or avocades, 1/4 thick rice was cold and hard, and it was smaller than usual.  Taste was okay after I took off some rice.  We also ordered just an avocado roll and the avocadoes werent ripe.  To top that off, when we went to pay with our credit card we were asked if we could pay cash.  Not the experience we used to have.  Very disappointing! Users/BingL
