Barbaras Dancing Tonight Presents!

The Davis Swing Kids is a dancing team, consisting mostly of adolescents between the ages of thirteen and seventeen (with exception of the instructors). The instructors, Barbara and Users/JeanettetheChipette Jeanette, are both experienced dancers. The company is rehearsing Tuesdays and Thursdays at Barbaras Dancing Tonight, and all are welcomed to come and see how things go. The songs they are currently choreographing to is The Andrew Sisters Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy and Give me More by Apartment 26 (the two songs are spliced together to form a roughly three minute dance).

20051117 22:03:05 nbsp I think the best thing about Swing Kids is the amazing amount of effort put into it, by every member of the team. I hate how I look in that photo! We should take a group one with everybody in it for this page. Users/JohnDudek

20051119 21:33:53 nbsp for SURE we need a group photo... I was just going to upload solo pictures of everyone (like Zachs which is actually right outside before some Tuesday)... what do you think? Users/SamanthaSpada

20051119 23:06:05 nbsp Id actually perfer a group pic, because the SwingKiddos are a team, so it seems more fitting to have a group picture. Users/JohnDudek

20051119 23:52:35 nbsp Holy memories, Batman!  I was in the first group of Swing Kids when Barbara started the thing in the early nineties (1994?).  I wonder if there are incriminating pictures of me at BDT? Users/GrahamFreeman

20051121 22:14:27 nbsp mmm... Ill get a group picture next Tuesday (cant tomorrow, dont have a camera) and It will be up ASAP. Users/SamanthaSpada

20051121 22:15:11 nbsp PS (for Graham) I wonder if there are incriminaing pictures of you... and other former Swing Kids... Thanks for the reminder Im going to ask Barbara about that tomorrow. ^_^ Users/SamanthaSpada

20051206 18:26:21 nbsp Thanks for putting up the alumni, thats a really cool idea. Users/JohnDudek

20051219 17:22:41 nbsp And why arent there any pictures of me? You guys would be nothing without me! You hear me?!? NOTHING!!!  Im juuussttt kidddiinnggg, no but seriously, why are there no pictures of me? Not cool. You all are getting the cold shoulder until my face is up here. Users/ErinGidding

20051219 23:09:16 nbsp Sorry that your beautiful face isnt here yet, Erin. Ill bring a camera to the next practice, then we can pepper this page with your wonder! lol. Thanks for the great show on Friday. Users/JohnDudek

20090513 17:33:37 nbsp This page is in need of some serious updates, as the team is completely different as it was when this page was made... in 2007. Ill get on that soon and try to get a picture of the current team! Users/JohnDudek
