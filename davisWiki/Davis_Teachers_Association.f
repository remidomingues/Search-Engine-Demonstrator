20100121 19:09:25 nbsp I am extremely dissapointed with Ingrid Salim and the DTAs refusal to make any concessions in this fiscal emergency. They would rather have 88 people fired and children suffer from less services. They dont care about education, they care about thier money. Sad but true. Actions speak louder than words.
Also, how did you frame your supposed questionaire to your members? Did you give them two choices that werent really choices? I heard you asked your memebers if they wanted to make concessions or not by saying: A: Yes? B. No/undecided.
This is not an honest survey and you all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
