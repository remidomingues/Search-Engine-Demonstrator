20070530 09:52:49 nbsp I’m not only a personal friend of Rachel but I have also received many massages from her and the experience has been wonderful, Her hands guide her as she massages you and you just feel the energy flowing through you as she works on you. I have at times a stressful job and having Rachel massage my shoulders is an incredible relief of my tight muscles. Having a full body massage reenergizing my entire body and inner being. I have had several massages in my life and none have come close to “Rachel’s magic hands”.  Users/LisaM

20070603 15:13:04 nbsp I just had a massage today. Rachel knows what she is doing, and she makes you comfortable. Massage is sooooo relaxing. Ive been to other places, but her style is more custommade, its like she cares about how you feel, and doesnt rush you out the door. Highly recommended. Users/KevinW

20100525 17:58:35 nbsp Rachel is very good at what she does. Im totally relaxed after the massage. There are times when she uses just enough pressure to relax the muscles. I have to say that I dozed off a couple of times because it was so relaxing.  Users/danwu
