Why use the Davis Timebank?
The Davis Timebank aims to strengthen the Davis community by utilizing talent and services within our community that would otherwise be unused. Instead of spending loads of money on services, we can help our neighbors accomplish their tasks and build friendships. Timebanking works great for basic tasks like transportation as well as specific skills like tutoring or maintenance. The Timebank aims to build a stronger sense of community while saving money.

How does it work? 
The Timebank runs when members exchange services. Everyone has something to offer! Let’s say you don’t have time to walk your dog on Friday. You could get help with your dog Friday and then help pick up someone’s dry cleaning on Saturday. Every hour you help someone else, you earn a onehour time credit that can be used to get services for you. When on the Timebank portal, you will be able to post services and view what others have offered.

The idea of timebanking started in the 1980’s. There are currently about 300 Timebanks in the U.S. and over 500 internationally.
