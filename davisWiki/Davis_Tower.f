Image(tower.jpg, thumbnail, 600, right)Davis Tower, CP RV076, is situated at the Train Station SP Depot and apparently holds some signal equipment and a visual Railroad Tracks track panel that is still occasionally used.  The Davis Tower was once home to the Western Union Telegraph Office before it moved to the Depot.
