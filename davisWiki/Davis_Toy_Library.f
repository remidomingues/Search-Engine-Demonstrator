The Davis Toy Library is a great way to explore a variety of toys for your children, without buying them or having them clutter up your house forever. Just like a regular library, you can borrow toys for a few weeks and then bring them back and get different ones. Its a great way to keep your kids interested in the toys you have at home! Some of the exciting toys in the library include: Games, Dolls & Animals, Puzzles, Blocks, Infant & Toddler Toys, Play Food/Dishes, Musical Instruments, Science Exploration, etc. It also includes an extensive collection of books, CDs and videotapes on parenting, child development (birth through teens), activities to do with children, choosing child care, special needs, and much more!

Annual membership is $15 (prorated to $7.50 after January 1). You can check out up to 3 toys at a time, for a 3week period.

The Davis Toy Library is located at the Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch Mary L. Stephens branch of the Yolo County public library. It was previously located at the http://cityofdavis.org/cs/childcare/ City of Davis Child Care Services office.
