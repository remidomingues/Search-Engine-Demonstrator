Davis Trans was a website dedicated to helping people Ride Board share rides with one another to and from Davis. We also wanted to provide desperate Davis residents with the tools they needed to get around Carfree in Davis without a car. Whether you’re going to the Bay Area or Southern California; all of the websites you’ll need are right here. We’ve even provided information about the environmental, economic, and social benefits of carpooling and using public transportation. We hope that this useful information will encourage the use of our site, and inspire others to stop and think about how their driving effects our environment.

We hope that you will consider using public transportation or carpooling for all of your transportation needs. Once you get the hang of it, its easy!
