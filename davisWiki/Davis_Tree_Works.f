20131012 15:32:09 nbsp Daniel was recommended by JAGCO Roofing & Painting for removal of a tree that unfortunately grew in a bad location. He did an excellent job including stump grinding and was very reasonably priced. I was impressed enough to create this wiki page. Previously I had used Kiwi Tree prior to Don leaving for a cooler climate, but Im very happy to have been referred to Daniel. Users/Dr.Baker

20131225 18:03:22 nbsp I needed a tree in my backyard cut back from my house and one removed. Daniel came out next morning, gave me a very competitive estimate and did the work within a few days. He did a great job. I can easily recommend him. Users/VeronikaMonell
