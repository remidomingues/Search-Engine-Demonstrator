The Davis Trinity is a ritual most often performed by UCD undergrads. It entails the consumption of three of the (arguably) strongest drinks in Davis in one night:

  The Wicky Wacky Woo at Bar Bernardo
  The Devastator at Bistro 33
  The FML at Red 88 Noodle Bar

Ideally, this feat is accomplished in one night and as quickly as possible. It is generally advised to prepare ahead of time (eat, drink a lot of water) and to not drink any other alcoholic beverages before embarking on the task. A determined group of adventurers can be expected to complete the Trinity within 90 minutes, even if they are drinking at a leisurely pace.
