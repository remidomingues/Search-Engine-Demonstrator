The Davis Ultimate Invite is an ultimate frisbee tournament that attracts both college and club teams from up and down the West Coast. The Davis Dogs and Pleiades host the event, commonly referred to as DUI. This years tournament will take place April 78, 2012 and features 30+ teams competing in three different divisions: Open Club/College, Womens Club/College, and mixed (coed). Games will occupy the campus many Intramural Fields IM fields throughout the weekend. The championship games are played Sunday afternoon, typically on the Hutchison IM Field Hutchison IM fields. These games are a chance for the common spectator to view the sport being played at the highest level. This year’s tournament marks DUI’s 25th anniversary, but naturally it has grown a lot since the 1980’s.

Sometimes teams are looking to pick up players for the weekend, but since this is a fairly competitive tournament most of them already have their rosters set.
