20100503 12:25:55 nbsp These guys reupholstered my truck ceiling. They were quick and did a great job. They even did the sun visors as well. I would highly recommend this shop if your cars sky is falling. Users/Avenamia

20110709 12:25:09 nbsp I had them reupholster my truck headliner recently.  Well, they were courteous and did do the job quickly, but the quality of the job was lacking.  The color is off (it doesnt match the sun visors which they didnt do), they got glue on the new liner which probably wont come off, and they left the truck with the old degrading foam material all over for me to clean up.  And, at $150 for a single cab pickup, thats a pretty steep price to pay. But, this is the only place in Davis that will do this that I know of, so I went with them.  Users/ibirdie

20110723 11:44:46 nbsp I just had a headliner done here, and I have to say they did a pretty impressive job. The guys at the shop were willing to accommodate my work schedule and managed to get the job done quickly. The color was a little off, but I cant complain the quality of the work and the turn around time did more than compensate for the slight color difference. I recommend these guys to anyone who has any upholstery concerns, they are one of Davis secret treasures.    Users/markaddler

20110808 11:14:55 nbsp The leather seats in my 2004 Accord had worn out in a couple of places. A coworker recommended Tawana at Davis Upholstery. She had her couch reupholstered there and thought he did a good job. Tawana gave me a cost estimate and said he would do the repairs Saturday and, if necessary, Sunday so I’d have the car back before Monday. He gave me his business and cell phone numbers and called with a progress report. I picked up the car Sunday afternoon and was very impressed with the quality of his work. Tawana also offered to drive the car to my house because I didn’t bring an extra driver with me.  Tawana is very nice and does quality work. In my case, the final bill was $50 less than the original estimate.   Users/nowhereman
