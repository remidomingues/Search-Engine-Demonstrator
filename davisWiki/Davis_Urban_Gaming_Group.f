Davis Urban Gaming Group (DUGG) is a UCDavis club dedicated to all things NERF.


 Meetings 
We meet every Saturday night at 7PM at the Death Star, staying there until 10PM (after which we get dinner at some random location).  Our games range from Team Deathmatches and special objective games to smallscale Humans vs Zombies games and deceptionbased social games. You must be a UC Davis affiliate or over 18 to participate.

While everything we play on Saturday nights involves NERF blasters we dont require you to bring your own (though it is highly encouraged). The club provides blasters and ammo for all members, a service provided through donations to the club and extra blasters owned by various club members. Eye protection is not necessary but encouraged.  We will have some community provided eye protection for you most of the time, but will probably run out when there are lots of people borrowing our stuff.

Some things we recommend to bring:
a bandanna,some water, eye protection, running shoes, and positive attitude :)

 Main Rules 



Some other rules that we use for a variety of different games that are useful to remember are these:

Respawning Rules
There are two sets of respawn rules we use frequently: the two corner rule and the central location rule.  For the two corner rule, the player who is respawning walks away from where they were shot and must pass two corners before standing against a wall and counting to thirty seconds.  If you are shot again while counting, you must walk another two corners and start your count over from the beginning.  Dont Be A Dick by following someone whos trying to respawn and resetting their timer over and over, though.  The central location rule is simpler: when a player needs to respawn, they walk to a central location, indicated at the beginning of the game, make physical contact with whatever the respawner is, usually a certain wall or table, and count to thirty seconds.  In both cases, after you have counted out your timer, youre back in play.



 Games 

Team Deathmatch  A firefight between two human teams.
Humans versus Zombies  a game of infection tag where those who are not it have NERF blasters.
Alamo  defend the point for a specific amount of time against an increasing number of enemies.

We also have several variants of these game types that keep everything fresh along with several more convoluted games that can only be explained through several paragraphs worth of text.
