Set on a beautiful 5acre campus in North Davis, the Davis Waldorf School program balances artistic, academic and practical work educating the whole child  hand and heart as well as mind. Its innovative methodology and developmentallyoriented curriculum, permeated with the art arts, address the childs changing consciousness as it unfolds, stage by stage. Imagination and creativity are cultivated as well as cognitive growth and a sense of responsibility for the earth and its inhabitants. Under the warm and active instruction of their teachers, children are provided with a creative and nurturing environment in which to develop, grow and learn.

The Davis Waldorf School offers children of all backgrounds the opportunity to reap the rewards of the elegantly simple Waldorf philosophy:

     To stimulate the mind
     To school the hands
     To engage the heart
     To encourage respect
     To foster a love of learning

wiki:WikiPedia:Waldorf education was the inspiration of the Austrian philosopher, educator, scientist and artist, wiki:WikiPedia:Rudolf Steiner (18611925). He designed a system that educates the whole child that is developmentally appropriate and that teaches the child to live in harmony with the natural world. In addition to Waldorf education, Rudolf Steiner founded and developed the fields of of wiki:WikiPedia:Biodynamic Agriculture and wiki:WikiPedia:Anthroposophy.

Love is higher than opinion. If people love one another the most varied opinions can be reconciled  this is one of the most important tasks for humankind today and in the future is that we should learn to live together and understand one another. If this human fellowship is not achieved, all talk of development is empty.  Rudolf Steiner
