In November of 2004 the town was atwitter with the distribution of new garbage cans and Recycling recycling cans.  Now you can see them all over town, on garbage pickup day.  No more unsightly, unmatched garbage cans provided by Davis Waste Removal.  Now, unsightly, matched garbage cans.  Users/StevenDaubert speculates that maybe it was cheaper to buy everyone in town a new trash can and recycle bin plus a brand new fleet than it was to pay the workers comps on the guys who used to drive and had to heft each can into the truck.  Under Davis Municipal Code section 32.01.050, garbage and recycling bins need to be put out between 5pm the night before pickup and 6am the day of, and they must be taken from the curb no later than 7am the day after pickup.

CRV

You can take your plastic bottles and aluminum cans to the DWR buyback center listed above and redeem the CRV. CRV redemption is 5 cents for aluminum cans and bottles under 24oz. and 10 cents for bottles 24oz. and above http://www.bottlesandcans.com/what_cash.php refund per container.  Normally they are weighed, but if you have 50 items or fewer you can request that they be counted instead of weighed. The CRV is set so that there is little benefit to counting. The amount paid by weight is set by the State of California, not by the recycling centers; the centers are reimbursed for the items collected which is why they require you to sign the check they give you.


Breakeven weight calculated as: 453.592g$.05/$1.59 (cans). This is the threshold above which it becomes advantageous to weigh (vs. count) the items.

A typical 12oz. aluminum can weighs 13.6g., so there are 32 cans/lb.


Up to 2 ml can cling to the sides of a water bottle, adding 2 grams.

Dropoff bins
Davis Waste Removal has recycling dropboxes available for people to bring their recycling 24/7. There are separate drop boxes to recycle these items:


  Scrap Metal
  Aluminum Cans
  Paper
  Cardboard and Brown Paper
  Plastics #1 and #2 (household and beverage containers only)
  Rigid plastics #3#7 (also rigid plastics #1 and #2 like flower pots, just no beverage containers etc.)
  Glass bottles and jars
  Tin cans, Foil and Pie Tins

Unlike the Yolo County Central Landfill, they used to be happy when you took scrap from them. This supported constructions of many whymcycles bicyclecontraptions. To encourage such behavior, they might or might not still hold days when theyll leave stuff out in front and you can go and choose whatever you like. But be sure to follow the rules as posted on the signs.  This is what the sign used to say:

In 2011 DWR put up a sign at their scrap steel collection bins saying that they will prosecute scavengers.

DWR has started up a  Commercial Food Scrap Pilot Program (enrollment in the pilot program ended April 28, 2011) for compost composting food, soiled paper, and related waste from businesses.  They also accept http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/hazardouswaste/usedmotoroil used motor oil and oil filters for recycling.  DWR also picks up green waste.  Trash is taken to the Yolo County Central Landfill. Plus, they sponsor the Davis Bike Club.

DWR does not accept electronic waste, that must be taken to the Yolo County Central Landfill where it is accepted free of charge 7 days a week.  DWR does not accept batteries (of any kind) for recycling.  Household batteries can be brought to Ace Hardware, CVS, Davis Senior Center, Davis Food Coop, or Hibbert Lumber for recycling.  Car batteries can be taken to Kragen auto parts.

For more information about what items DWR accepts for recycling, check out the http://www.DavisRecycling.org City of Davis Recycling Website.  You can also find information there about their Bulky Items DropOff Days.

20081125 20:57:45 nbsp If you live in Davis, this is a great service to be able to recycle your own items by dropping them off for free. If you are moving out, come by this location and get some boxes for free.  Believe me, since moving back to my hometown in Southern California, I truly miss this place and this service. Yay for doityourself hasslefree recycling!! Users/BenjaminCatabas

20090522 15:46:54 nbsp today, we only filled up a trash can and 1/4 worth of plastic bottles. my cynical room mate thought i was going to only get two dollars for it, but in the end, i got a hefty 7 dollars. mind you this is only a can and a quarter full of bottles, thats easily a weeks worth if you live with soda drinkers and people who dont trust davis water. Users/chand3123k

20100225 17:07:03 nbsp Davis water is of higher quality than bottled water...I think its hilarious that people pay for something, that is almost free, because they think its better when its actually worse. Users/jdyeah

20110110 15:54:15 nbsp Sometimes we get takeout containers that are marked with a 6  they are styrofoamlike, but not the real styrofoam like you find in a cheap cooler.  Youre not supposed to put styrofoam in the drop boxes.  Does anyone know if those takeout containers count? Users/CovertProfessor
  Found the answer to my question in todays (1/11/11) Davis Enterprise: Styrofoam and other expanded polystyrene items such as packing peanuts and takeout food packing cannot be placed in recycling carts..These items will often have a #6 recycling symbol on them, but unlike regular polystyrene #6 plastic, the expanded polystyrene is not considered a rigid plastic and is not accepted for recycling in the recycling carts.

 I brought in one big black garbage bag full of crushed cans, a smaller white bag and about 7 grocery bags full of uncrushed cans which weighed about 50 pounds total. I got a total of $77.47. Their price of aluminum is $1.54/lb as of July 2009. users/brookeb
 The aluminum price of $1.54/lb is still accurate as of 5142011. users/aroach12

20110815 14:41:40 nbsp How long can you legally leave your bins in the street for? Users/MikeyCrews
 Per Davis Municipal Code 32.01.050, for individually serviced residences (i.e. most houses), Emptied containers shall be removed from the curb by seven a.m. on the day following collection. Users/TomGarberson
    Interesting. I wonder how early you can put them out. Our neighbor has decided to claim parking spaces with them. Users/MikeyCrews
     From the same code section: Such placement shall occur no earlier than 5:00 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled collection day, nor later than 6:00 a.m. on collection day. tg
    Interesting again. Part of me thinks I should go inform him about the city code ( since hes been kind enough to inform me about other city codes). But part of me thinks it might be best to just try and let go of this petty dispute. Users/MikeyCrews

20111019 17:43:50 nbsp I moved here (from Sacramento) in April and Id like to know if its legal to leave old couches, etc. on the curb. (When the students moved out they were everywhere.) Also, what about old fencing and other construction material? Again, Ive seen quite a bit of it.  Users/ScottSchiller
  It is most definitely illegal to leave couches on the curb, and I suspect the same is true of the fencing and construction material.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Yes, it is illegal. Leaving furniture, mattresses and other items in the street or on the sidewalk is a violation of City Code and a safety hazard for bicycles and pedestrians.  It is also against City Code to leave indoor furniture in front of your property in public view (indoor couches in front yard).  http://qcode.us/codes/davis/ The only things acceptable to be placed in the street for pickup are flattened cardboard and yard materials.
