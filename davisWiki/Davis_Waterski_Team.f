Team motto: EVERYBODY WINS!

The Davis Waterski Team is one of the sport clubs on campus. It is a coed team part of the western region competing with teams from all over the west coast. Members compete in three different events; slalom, trick skiing and jump.  Many members of the waterski team live at the hall of juSTIce.

Practices are run from Bell Acqua Lake in Rio Linda (2030 minutes from Davis). It is a private lake used mostly by the ski team and private members of the lake. Ski team members are allowed use the lake Monday through Friday from about 8am2pm. Practices are unscheduled officially and participants use the lake when they can get out there, making having a full schedule, work/internships internship and other activities possible (though youll want to spend all your free time at the lake skiing).

Tournament seasons are in the fall and spring. The lake is closed early December to February because of temperature (though there is a hot tub on the dock).
