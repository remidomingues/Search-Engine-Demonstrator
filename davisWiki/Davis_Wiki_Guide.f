 Introduction 

A wiki is a linked set of pages which anyone can edit and expand. This freedom allows for unique expression and helps foster interesting and new ideas in an organic and very dynamic way.  The Front Page Davis Wiki is a wiki devoted to Davis, as noted by its Mission Statement.

If you see something you think is inaccurate or incorrect, you have the power to change it, as do all of the other editors. If you see that something is incomplete, you can add more information.  You can also create completely new content and tie it into the rest of the site. Likewise, others have the power to veto your changes.  It is a delicate balance but one which ultimately leaves the users with the content they most want.

Never be afraid to change something or try something new! However dont be surprised if information you remove is restored by other editors.

IMPORTANT:  In order to edit pages, you must first create an account.  This is a very painless process and the only hurdle to contributing content. It is a really good idea to use your importance of using your RealName real name when signing up because it helps start the process of establishing identity here with other editors

Making an account is as easy as clicking a button and choosing an appropriate name (like BobSmith).  If you would like to be able to retrieve a forgotten password, you should also enter a valid email address.  Thats it.  After making an account you should check out the People page and make a homepage for yourself.

 Editing 
Editing a page is as simple as clicking on the Edit tab at the top of the screen.  There are, however, many possible options for markup (i.e. making the page look pretty.)  For your convenience, we have made a formatting toolbar, which works very much like a toolbar in a word processor.  By highlighting text and clicking one of the buttons, such as Bold, the text will be surrounded by the appropriate markup to make it appear bold.  More information on editing can be found over at wiki:wikispot:Help with Editing.  In general, just looking at how existing pages do things (by clicking on Edit and looking at the raw content) should let you figure out the markup  which is very simple!  (Always make sure you Preview before you Save Changes, otherwise you might end up editing a page several times)

 Linking 
The most important concept, though, is linking.  The idea is to have all pages linked together in a logical and intuitive way.  To make a link to a page, type the exact name of the page you wish to link to, surrounded by quotes and brackets.  This means to link to the page Front Page I type {{{Front Page}}}.  Its that simple.  To make a link to a page that displays differently, such as a link to Front Page that displays as Front Page Hello World! you just write {{{Front Page Hello World!}}}.  Capitalization doesnt matter for links.

Also, try to be descriptive in your linking.  Dont use the click here! phrase: For more info check Wiki Sand Box here is bad! Check out Wiki Sand Box for more info is good! (http://www.w3.org W3.org has some http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere tips on good link style)

To link to a page outside the wiki, you write your link like {{{http://www.city.davis.ca.us/ this}}} which displays as http://www.city.davis.ca.us/ this.  Of course, you can also just write {{{http://www.city.davis.ca.us/}}} or {{{http://www.city.davis.ca.us/}}} if you dont want any alternative text.  So remember  use quotes for things inside the wiki, no quotes for things outside (normal websites).

 New pages 
To create a page, first think about where you want this page to be linked from.  Say you want to create a page about your favorite local band.  Ideally, there should be a link to this band in Music Scene or perhaps other pages as well.  You would go edit Music Scene to add a link to your page  even though your page hasnt been made yet.  Once you save your changes and click on the new link, youll be given the opportunity to create the page!

TIP:  If you cant think of a page to create, look over the Wanted Pages.  It is a list of pages which have been linked but have not been created.  Perfect candidates for a writeup!

If this is unclear, just view the source (by clicking on Info and clicking on raw for the top item  or if youre lazy, just by clicking Edit) of some pages!  It will become perfectly clear after a few minutes.

To create a page without making a link to it first, simply type the name of the desired page into the search box.  Then you will be prompted with the option of creating the page.  But remember: because you made the page without first making a link to it, it might get lost in the sea of pages.  Linking is very important for this reason  If you dont link your new page from existing pages, then no one will be able to find it.  Spend some time thinking about good places where you should make a link to your new page.  Using the search box is very useful for finding phrases and material where you might want to provide a link.

You should head over to Wiki Sand Box and edit it and play around!

 Info Tab / Revision History 
The wiki tracks all the changes made to all the pages, and this information is available in the Info tab at the top of the screen.  Every edit of a page accounts for a new version, and clicking Diff once in the Info tab allows you to see differences between selected versions.  view shows you what that version of the page looked like, raw shows you the raw wiki markup, print gives you a printerfriendlier version, and revert reverts the current version of the page back to that particular version.

In the Info tab you may also bookmark a page, which allows you to track the changes to the page via the Bookmarks page.  Setting wiki bookmarks allows you to easily see when pages important to you change, and allows you to keep a list of pages you like, as well.  You should probably set a wiki bookmark for your user page so you can see when others leave you comments.

 Now what? 
After youve made an account, viewed the source of some pages, and played around with editing over in Wiki Sand Box, you should go ahead and make a home page for yourself!  To make a homepage, simply make a page in the wiki with the same name as your login name, but with Users/ in front of it.  This means if your name is PhilipNeustrom (its not), you simply make the page with the title Users/PhilipNeustrom and fill it with whatever you want.  Theres an easy way to do this: click on your user name in the upper right hand corner!  After making your homepage, head over to People and add your page to the list.

 Mapping 
Every page in the wiki can have some map information associated with it.  Obviously, this is only a good idea in some cases (when the page can be given a geographic location).  Check out wiki:wikispot:Help with Maps for more on this!

 Tips 
  Use Bookmarks!  You can mark pages as bookmarks by going into their Info tab.  When a page is bookmarked youll be able to remember it later on, and also see if its changed (without having to check Recent Changes).
  Link link link!  After youve made a page you should search the wiki looking for places to add links to your new page.  After all, if you make a page, shouldnt you make sure everyone else can see it?  Occurrences of the page name are immediately candidates for links. Beyond this, you can The Dairy get creative and link relevant text accordingly.
  Preview!  Always click Preview before you click Save Changes in order to make sure everything looks right, etc!  Even the best of us forget this all too often.
