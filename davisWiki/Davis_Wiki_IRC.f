IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.  Its a protocol for chatting on the internet thats fairly popular. The most excellent Davis Wiki IRC/Gateway #daviswiki channel is located on the http://www.freenode.net freenode IRC network.  You can also access the chat room if you have wiki:WikiPedia:Java Virtual Machine Java by http://java.freenode.net/index.php?channeldaviswiki following this link.

Some are of the opinion that it should also have a bot, but nobody could come up with a use for it. Until then see IRC/Tips. The channel was registered with the ChanServ on March 24 03:17:29 2005 by JabberWokky.

To use IRC, you can use the popular http://www.mirc.com/ mIRC software for Windows. For OSX you can use http://colloquy.info/ Colloquy or http://fire.sourceforge.net/ Fire software. Trillian and Fire additionally support AIM, ICQ,  MSN, and Yahoo messenger. You can also download the multiplatform IRC client http://www.xchat.org/download/ Xchat (or other client of your choice), connect to irc.freenode.net, and join #daviswiki. If youd prefer, you can use the IRC client on a shell server such as isun.ucdavis.edu or wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us to connect if you have an account. This is especially useful when combined with wiki:WikiPedia:GNU Screen, allowing the user to idle in the channel all the time.

The first entirely unofficial IRC Meetup was held on the uncommon Borders Corporate Center Commons during Free Cone Day.

IRC is not like Yahoo Chat or AOL Messenger  its a bit more technical.  If you are a newbie to Internet Relay Chat, youll need to be familiar with IRCs many commands.  For more information, check out http://www.mirc.com/cmds.html this resource.


Here is an example of what an IRC chat looks like:
{{{
23:20 <PreLOW> Wow, amazing
23:22 <PreLOW> I knew you guys had no lives, but my knees are quaking at this
23:23 <PreLOW> you spend all day editing the wiki, then you get on IRC and chat about it...
23:23 <PreLOW> good lord!
23:23 <PreLOW> peace!
23:23 ! PreLOW has quit Client Quit
23:30 <jraller> Too bad you didnt stick around...
23:41 <therealjess> yeah, he could have seen 24 hours go by without anyone saying anything!
23:41 <JabberWokky> Thats gotta be put on the wiki.
}}}

 theoretical bot 

 update notifier
 faq
 trivia
 magic 8ball

     Note that a bot was created, but I couldnt really see anything to do with it.  If we got people coming in asking questions, a faq server would make sense, but they dont.  I set up an update notifier in #daviswikitest, and it spammed the channel.  Other uses are toys.  jw


 Other IRC 
UCD IRC server There used to be a UC Davis IRC Server. It was shut down in 2004.

20070709 05:56:59 nbsp Lawl, I just joined the #DW for the first time, GFG Users/StevenDaubert

20100130 17:04:27 nbsp I get disconnected when I try to use the link at the top of the page.  It logs in, then instantly, it goes back to the username selection with a big red Terminated.  Tried both Chrome and Firefox, and Im not about to use IE!  Any tips?  Or should I just get ChatZilla set back up? Users/TomGarberson

20100130 20:52:26 nbsp iirc freenode has been spammed hard recently, may have something to do with it Users/StevenDaubert
 No apparently its something that just needs to cook with the wok to fix Users/StevenDaubert

20100130 21:02:14 nbsp Well, it does seem that freenode is not available on mibbit at the moment. So using another irc client of your choice is probably better. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  You know, freenode just did a massive network upgrade in the last 24 hours.  It may well be a temporary thing, as they warned people not to use a whole number of servers that were being phased out. jw
  Its still doing it now.  Ill check again sometime later.  And Ill just dig up chatzilla. tg
