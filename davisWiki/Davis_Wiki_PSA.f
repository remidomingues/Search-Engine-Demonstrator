Is it okay to say it wicky?  Users/KenjiYamada
   Thats my vote on how to say it.  Users/JackHaskel
Ive heard it both ways.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
   Users/MikeIvanov Mike and I say wicky because we think weekee is more nonEnglish sounding  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   Yeah, weekee sounds kind of dorky, even though its more correct.  Users/MikeIvanov
   wicky is also the proper Hawaiian pronunciation.  Users/SteveLambert
     I actually thought veekee would be the correct Hawaiian, because I had a voice teacher who had taught me Hawaiian songs where w is pronounced as v. Users/BrentLaabs
   One thing that KDVS is very particular about (because it is the law) is not having calls to action in PSAs.  So be careful when writing a PSA to be very indirect yet informative. You arent allowed to sell someone on the wiki only inform them about the wiki.
     So is the revolutionary language bad?  How would you rephrase it?
     I believe the calls to action stuff only applies to sponsorship/underwriting messages  Users/SteveLambert
     No, it applies to everything.  DJs are not allowed to tell people to do anything or go anywhere, and neither are announcements.  However, the main loophole with this is that you have to give them to option to not do it (which is why the DavisWiki PSA has the if you are interested... section).  Users/StephenHo

20050214 09:50:47 nbsp I just heard the PSA, awesome. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050324 22:34:50 nbsp Users/JenndelaVega Jenn and I played this PSA on our show this morning on KDVS. (shameless plug!) Users/YawenChen

20050907 16:51:39 nbsp Is it also playing on KDRT? Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20080412 16:40:12 nbsp Finally, a worthwhile PSA!  Normally, the PSAs are so ridiculous and unhelpful (like the ones about turbulence or second hand smoking).   Users/CurlyGirl26
watch out, more people get hurt a year in football then turbulence! we need to make a turbulence psa that references things your body is made for!  Users/StevenDaubert
