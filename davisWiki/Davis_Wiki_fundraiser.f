For more information, see the bylaws page & the Wiki Bureaucracy/Bylaws/Talk talk page. If youre interested in helping the wiki out for the next year and taking an active role in the organization as a whole, please consider being on the board.  If youre interested but wont be there at the time, just make a note on this page.  Location for discussion and selection:  Sunday at 8PM at Mishkas Cafe in the frontish table area.  (Note:  you can come to simply help the discussion out and have a say in what happens)


There is also a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/event.php?eid2204889829 facebook event for the davis wiki wacky woo.


This comes very late in the game, but might be useful for future events. It being summer, hacky sack is a pretty fun way to not think about the heat, and hacky sacks can be crocheted/knitted! They also very conveniently mirror the shape of the wiki logo. I dont have a http://www.bevscountrycottage.com/hackysack.html pattern with the wiki logo, but perhaps some very fast knitting wiki knitters might be able to create a few for giveaways. Hacky sacks are also good for tossing into crowds... no tshirt cannon needed.

Image(EastCoastBranch.jpg, thumbnail, To Absent Friends!)While we, as Davis Exiles, cant make it this time, we wish the best to all!   (We actually considered going, but figured if we had anywhere near plane fare we should just donate it... and then the car died).  We chipped in the pot, and raised a toast to all those involved in the fundraiser.  Best of luck and enjoy the evening!  Users/SarahHillard Sarah and Users/JabberWokky
