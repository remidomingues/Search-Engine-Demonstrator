This page is a list of things Davis either sorely lacks or that certain wiki users are demanding be supplied. Something like Davis Wish List/Target Target is debatable whether or not most people in Davis wish for it or not; then again, the debate occurred and the Target arrived.  But as for this list, wiki users can hope that businesses and/or the City Council will take note of our suggestions. Also see I Love Davis, I Hate Davis, and Plethora vs. Dearth in Davis.


Water Fountain for Kids
    We used to have one in Central Park, what happened? Meanwhile, Woodland installs an awesome water park for kids in Slaven Park. We need a free, safe place to cool off in the summer!

 Fondue Bar 
I think a good fondue bar would be cool.  Kinda like what a hookah bar would be like but fondue.  Like dessert and stuff.

 Art 
You know what we need to do in this town? Something along the lines of http://www.cowparade.com. Because if any town can do weird public art, involving cows, its us.

As the Payphone Project has shown, there are protected posts all around Davis.  Repurposing them to a community http://www.theatlanticcities.com/artsandlifestyle/2012/02/hownewyorkpayphonesbecameguerrillalibraries/1288/ shared library would be awesome.  In April 2012, the East Davis Library in a Box started showing it can be done.

 Music Studio / Practice Space 
If you need to rent a place to practice with your band, where can you go? Id rent one if there was one available locally, and I know other musicians who would do the same.
  KDVS!

 Coffee  
Also see Cafes.
 Late at night 
  I know this is a pipe dream, but Id love to have a place in Davis where I could get coffee at practically any hour (that isnt AM/PM).  It was so nice when Cafe Roma stayed open for 24 during that one finals week  oh, such a taste of what was possible!  I hear that it isnt worth it to keep a coffee shop open that late at night, and its likely not, but itd still be cool to have a place to get coffee.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   Ahh, such a sweet, sad dream. Coffee at night. Its pathetic that a college town of this size cant support an all night coffee shop. When Im up at 4 am and need coffee and a quiet place to study, I have to go to Dixon, which can be a real pain when I only have my bike available. How can Davis have 25K students, and not enough latenighters to make it worthwhile? What is wrong with everyone? Ok, I think Im done ranting, but I too dream of a 24hour Roma.  Users/EricKlein
   I would waaaay make use of an all night cafe (especially one with free wireless Internet).  Users/DougBarbieri
   Lets just start our own studentrun 24hour coffee shop. Most likely stupid and infeasible, but cant hurt to look at the costs.  Users/JeyKottalam
   I wholeheartedly agree. I have often commented that if I had money and any business skills at all, I would open one myself.  I miss the warehousestyle coffee shops where I grew up.  Crappy couches, customer drawings and poetry slapped on the wall, and open past two a.m. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
   Is there some sort of city ordinance against (or unofficial discouragement of) latenight/24 hour establishments? I really cant believe that the reason there isnt even one (barring drivethru fast food, which doesnt count) is lack of interest, given the crowds that descend on nonDavis establishments after Davis shuts down. Users/JessicaLuedtke
   Im not convinced that a 24hour coffee place would make enough money to stay open for long.  What they would have instead is a shop full of students too cheap to purchase anything beyond the bare minimum (with rare exceptions, of course).  That said, the likeliest place (imo) would be locallyowned Delta of Venus  has anyone brought up the 24hour request with the owner there? I usually drive to Java California when I need a 24hr spot, I assumed the rent there is cheaper than in Davis, but thats just my speculation. Users/IrenePark
   The argument (from a business standpoint) of extending business hours to 24 is the loyalty it will build. People will come because its the only place open, then come back during the day because its where they are comfortable. Treat it like advertising, even if the additional hours cost more than they bring in, the net result is increased revenues for the business. Its just the same as coffeeshops that offer WiFi. We should be able to convince a local shop to at least test it out with that argument. Users/PatrickRogers
   I agree that, especially with Davis high rent and real estate prices, its not very lucrative to have a 24hour business when your clientele spends only about $5 yet occupies a seat for a few hours and sucks off your wireless access. Yet I can also appreciate the desire for late night/all night coffee. Perhaps somebody with ASUCD connections could suggest they buddy up with the Silo folks and extend hours during the academic year for those people who dont own coffee makers or just dont want to host a coffee house in their living room. Since students are already paying for the Internet access on campus, a small business owner wouldnt have to carry that burden as well. Though the Coffee House might be the first thought for a location, the Silo might be better because its cozier/smaller than the CoHo.
   I dont know if this would satisfy all you coffeehounds out there, but what Id like to see is a 24hour doughnuts doughnut shop.  Ive seen them in the Bay Area, even in the less densely populated South Bay.  The shops that are dedicated to doughnuts (Fluffy Donuts and Variety Donuts... throw in Konditorei if you like) arent even open in the evenings, much less for all night.
   You didnt hear it from me, but  La Quinta has a 24hour coffee station (really basic stuff, not quite what youre asking for but always wellstocked with hot coffee and a variety of teas) and if youre really nice and obviously not a bum you might be able to mooch some off the night workers.

 More Coffee 
   Not only does Davis need latenight coffee, it needs more coffee.  I just know that someone out there has a couple of hundred grand to spare and is just looking for a place to invest it.  So heres what you do: find a good location somewhere with the 2 mile vicinity of campus, and open up a new coffee house.  I get sick of going to the same crowded places, seeing the same people!  No?  Okay then, when I come up with two hundred or so thousand, and open up a new coffee shop, complete with wireless access, and get a return on my investment, youll wish it had been you! Right. Users/AnnieSirrah
     Unfortunately, your wish was granted and about 3 new cafes opened up in the last year or so (Pachamama, Cloud Forest, and Barista Brew). Pachamama doesnt have any space to sit, its just a counter in the CoOp. The other two emphasize food, not coffee. My hopes for a serious coffee cafe are low since the perceived cafe saturation is extremely high. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

Good Coffee
  In addition to more coffeehouses and ones open late, Davis needs good coffee.  No, make that, Davis needs GREAT coffee.  For comparisons, see wiki:sacramento:Temple Coffee House Temple and Infusion over in wiki:sacramento Sac. Users/isoquinophlex
     Check out Pachamama Cafe in the Davis Food Coop CoOp! Its wonderful! Users/gurglemeow
  Unfortunately, Pachamama Cafe coffee does not compare to Temple, Blue Bottle, Ritual, Barefoot, etc. My wish would be less BAD COFFEE, more GOOD COFFEE  Users/CoffeeSnobDavis
     You can get Blue Bottle at Monticello and Our House; Let Them Eat Cake has Ritual. Does that count?


 Consideration 
 It seems that many people, not just in Davis, are far more concerned about bettering themselves or their personal environment than how they impact others. Whether it be passing judgment on others or driving carelessly, these incidents cause us all to wrinkle earlier and generally become a bit meaner. Oftentimes its better to let things go or compromise for the sake of peace than fight to the bloody end, whether your issue is politics or a rude store clerk.

 Democracy 

 Choice Voting 
  Choice Voting should be implemented for Davis City elections. See Davis Citizens for Representation.
  I would like it if we could put forth referendums and vote on issues on the local level. Citizen Initiated Referendums  Direct democracy.  Users/ConsciousConsumer
   We do have this.  Right now, people are trying to get  referendum on the ballot to vote on the water rate increase.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Could we start a wiki on this with some more info on how to get them started and how to vote? Im very interested, I knew that CA had stuff at the state level. Apparently you need signatures of 10% of the people who voted in the last Governor election to get it considered though, and even then they can be vetoed etc.  Users/ConsciousConsumer

 Entertainment 

 An AllAges Venue 
  There are many all ages venues in Davis. Every house in this town has the capability of putting on a House Show but there are no official all ages venues in this town. The Coffee House has shows but it is not consistent. This town needs to do something about how half of its population i.e. Students dont have any real place where they can appreciate music that fits their needs. Users/RobRoy
    I read something about the old Theater being taken over by new management and so forth, but that the Davis City Council had wanted to pass a resolution prohibiting it from being used exclusively as a (Hiphop scene Hiphop?) venue.  My net is too slow, otherwise Id check into this.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    For years weve been needing this. Last year a poll was taken within DaVinci and it was found that a good percentage of the students here would love to have a place where local bands can play, and other bands coming through. The coffeehouse has been used for shows before but its not really even a venue and if its ever to rain youre basically screwed. There was a great thing going back when the Grad would play shows. that was probably the closest thing to an all age venue that ive ever seen working continuously in Davis, but I heard they didnt make all the payments to the bands and stopped booking shows as a result. A lot of us high school students dont like going to houses cuz its one of those ahhh college students experiences where youre around a lot of people you dont know in a place youre not sure youre really allowed to go to... We need a place thats sole business is the promotion of music and booking bands for Davisites musical yearnings. Its funny that most people come to Davis to buy tickets for shows in Orangevale and Roseville, and Sacramento... but none of the venues are in davis. There definitely needs to be a venue for college students and minors alike, because bars and coffeeshops dont cut it. Users/norasandstedt norabeth
      You say coffeeshops dont cut it, but I can only assume that you mean Delta of Venus doesnt cut it. I wonder why you think so. While its certainly not the ideal choice as the best venuewhich it is by default as there are no othersits a really welcoming place, and the caliber and variety of bands and artists coming through there is pretty incredible, rivalling prestigious venues in the Bay Area like San Franciscos Hemlock Tavern and Oaklands Stork Club.Users/RickEle
      In Fall 2006, Campus Unions Programs began hosting Pub Live at the Silo Pub and Cafe Silo Pub. Its a consistent venue that hosts shows every Friday of the school year. Weve hosted acts from all over the place including many local favorites, bands from the Bay Area passing by on tour, and even bands from as far as Brooklyn and Seattle. Were an eclectic venue, so contact us if you want to play, or know of a band that needs a little exposure. Importantly, Pub Live shows are always allages, free, and open to the public. Pretty cheap beer and great nachos, too!  Users/AnneJuliaBaluyot

 Comedy Club 
  Drop down off your high horse and pick up that microphone. Thats right, Davis needs a stand up (openmic) comedy club. The California Aggie Aggie columnist Michael Giardina mentioned this awesomeass idea once, but nobody has started it up. Whats the deal? Not convinced, read the this http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/04/01/Features/Ain146t.Nothing.not.Going.On1319989.shtml?norewrite200606071941&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com article.

   Comedy at the The Graduate Davis GradAugust 16, 2005 the Davis Graduate welcomes Comedians Rick Pulido & Shane Murphy to the stage. We started doing monthly comedy shows in June, making this our third event. Its a Tuesday night. Starts at 10pm. Yes, there are drink specials.  No, there is no drink minimum. We would like to move this from a monthly event to a twice a month event if its supported. For more info go to http://www.davisgrad.com

 Drum Circle 
    Maybe that is something that could suit the experimental college... or another venue, but this town is seriously lacking a drum circle: drummers getting together (with djembe and else) and playing, improvising, with someone with trained ear leading the way. Users/PassingThrough

 Hookah Bar 
Also see Smoking.
  It is a matter of necessity. Davis needs a hookah bar. Users/MikeKayton
  It seems like a surprising amount of people have their own hookahs. Actually, I dont know if they still do, but Sams Mediterranean used to have several ornate hookahs on display. I was talking to Sams daughter, and she said they were talking about having a hookah setup but since Davis has so many antismoking ordinances, I bet they discovered it would basically be illegal to operate Users/JaimeRaba jr
    So many? What are they?
  A large number of people in town have hookahs, myself included. Seems like this crowd would have access to one? Hookah/Movie nights were pretty popular with my friends. Users/KenNeville
  Davis definitly needs a hookah bar. We finally got Dead Zone Novelties, the cool novelty store that sells smoking supplies, now we just need a chill place to enjoy them. It sucks that the nearest hookah bar is in Sacramento, and we have to drive a halfhour away to enjoy some good sheesha. City council needs to recognize that this is primarily a college town, and without us students, there would be no Davis. Users/CCTush
Hooka Bars cant be established in Davis because of a city ordinance that prohibits smoking within and around 100 feet of any establishment.  Users/RobertBaron

 Inexpensive Movie Theater 
Also see Movie Theaters.
  The city I used to live in has a http://www.douglastheatres.com/theatres.php?TID15 $2.00 movie theater which shows secondruns, in other words, blockbuster movies from recent years. This way, if you missed seeing it the first time, or wanted to see it again, or wanted to see it but didnt feel like spending $68 for something you werent sure about, this is the place. It immediately became the most popular theater in town. Users/SteveDavison
  I wholeheartedly agree.  I too lived in a place with a 2 buck movie theatre.  It had all current movies, but about 46 weeks after they initially opened.  It was awesome! Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle
     It is very hard to run a movie theatre that can charge that low of ticket prices.  Nowadays, the distributors charge movie theatres so much for licensing that almost all of the money made in the box office goes straight back to them, and paying bills.  Yeah, I agree, expensive movies suck, but its really hard to operate that cheaply.  Its not impossible though.. Users/JulienBiewerElstob
  If we could get a new modern large movie theater built in Davis, the old Regal theaters could be changed to bargain theaters. However, where would we put a new theater? Perhaps when the old Toomey field closes, they could build a new Movie Theater, a new Parking Garage, shops, restaurants, and apartments.  We could make that corner of campus a brand new Gateway to the Campus. You could eat, shop, and see movies all close to campus.

Oscar Party
  Wishing for a fun spot to gather and watch the Oscars on bigscreen. Seems like a great promotional idea for a bar or restaurant. Would settle for a community center.

 Health Clinic (dropin) 
  We just had one at Longs called the Wellness Express Clinic, but unfortunately they closed. Its too bad because it was the only place you could drop in for basic healthcare in the evenings and on the weekends. Most people probably didnt know they were there.
         Im not sure if this is what you mean by Health Clinic, but there is a free clinic in the city of Davis that is open in the evenings, its mostly maintained by UCD Med students, its open until around 10 p.m., and.. its free!  Users/Carley
          What about the CommuniCare Health Center? Users/gurglemeow

 Landscaping Bins 
Instead of throwing landscaping junk in the middle of the bike lanes so that it can blow around the streets, the city should supply landscaping bins.  It would be more aesthetically pleasing, and less hazardous for bikes.  Keep the bins in your yard until garbage day.  Its not exactly a novel concept, since many towns have already adopted this practice.  Why Davis hasnt, Im not exactly sure.
  By using bins, there is an inherent limit on the amount of green waste one can dispose of in a given week. Speaking from experience, the bin is large enough for the grass clippings and some small pruning, but for the once or twice a year that a major cutting takes place, there is no way to fit it all in. I really dont have any sympathy for the people who complain about it being a hazard to bikes, because anyone who manages to hit a stationary pile of leaves and twigs probably should avoid being on a bike altogether. I have, in five years in Davis, only hit a pile once: It was night time, I was riding down a dark road, and I didnt have a bike light. It was dumb of me to be in that situation, so I really have no basis to complain about it. Also: Millions of towns? That number seems a bit high to me. Users/JoePomidor

   Its not the hitting the pile thats the problem: its the going around the pile and almost getting hit by a bus.  Sure, YOU might have only had one negative experience, but Ive seen this be a problem for many people.   If youre putting enough greenwaste out that it wont fit into the large bin they give you, youre definitely creating a hazard.  Not to mention the fact that the greenwaste blocks the storm drains, blocks parking spots, puts more dust into the air, and according to the Can the Trash! Coalition, the city of Sacramento says billing rates are 22% less expensive for pick up using the containers.  It might be somewhat of a nuisance to use a bin instead of casually throwing it all on the street, but so are lots of other things we do day to day.  But we do it because its better for everyone. Users/Jes
   If its only once or twice a year that there is too much waste for the bin, then on that once or twice a year, the household could put the green waste out over a few weeks.  Its a small price to pay for having the streets clear for cyclists and parking all of the rest of the year.  Id love to see Davis start to use landscaping bins  Users/CovertProfessor
   One thing that makes the piles a hazard to bikes is that the material blows around. Even if the homeowner puts out a tidy pile that doesnt block the bike lane, wind can drag those stray branches and rose thorns into cyclists way. Also, its ugly, messy, and clogs the storm drains. Its ridiculous that we dont have green waste bins. Users/Virginia

 Open Space 
  Topography ie: gradient, vertical rise, a knoll perhaps?
 Real British Pub 
  You read correctly.  Calling G Street a pub is akin to calling Taco Bell a Mexican restaurant.  Nothing about G Street makes it a pub.  No authentic decor, no obscure ales and lagers from various parts of the UK, no pub food (bangers & mash, chips, etc.), not to mention no trivia night (and before you jump all over me, Im aware that there is a trivia night at several other establishments in Davis).  If youre not sure what a real British pub is like, check out the Crown and Anchor next time youre in Monterey.  http://www.crownandanchor.net.  Why does he love British pubs so much, you might ask?  Ill tell you why.  Real British pubs not only boast great beer selections and charming decor, but the ambiance is unmatched.  In addition, they seem to attract a completely different sort of bargoer; people generally dont go there looking for a hook up from what Ive noticed,  and there is a distinct (and refreshing) lack of bros.  You know of whom I speak.  With the large older crowd at Davis (5th years, graduate students, etc.), there is definitely an untapped market for a true British pub here.  Users/CameronYoung
    Your wish is (sort of) granted: de Veres Irish Pub  Users/OldDavis73
     An (American) Irish Pub is closer to an (American) British Pub than many other kinds of bars (e.g. The Graduate is further). But British ≠ Irish! Users/DougWalter
       Agreed, didnt mean to suggest that Irish  British in any sense.  I guess I was just trying to read into the intent of the Wish List item, thinking more generally in terms of a real pub in Davis.  Users/OldDavis73

 Restaurants 
Also see Restaurants.

 24Hour Los AngelesStyle Mexican Restaurant 
  LAstyle restaurants do not use excessive filling (e.g., lettuce, beans, rice) in their burritos.  Take for example the famous http://www.albertosmexicanfoods.com/menu.htm Albertos momandpop chain (each store individually owned).  Their Carne Asada burrito is a model for all Taco Shop aspirants to follow.  AND theyre 24hour.  Wheres the 24hour authentic Mexican food?   Users/JaimeRaba
  a place in Davis without excessive filling is the Taqueria Davis on L St. next to Aggie Liquor.  Their taco salad is a pile meat with some lettuce sprinkled on top!
     I dont think of 24hour restaurants when I think authentic Mexican food.  And I didnt know they had a 24hour Fitness around here...  Users/MarieHuynh
       Mom & Pop Mexican fastfood joints in SoCal are often open 24hours.  Users/JeyKottalam
            Im thinking of the incredibly popular Freebirds near UC Santa Barbara.  Users/JamesDawe
            Yeah, but Freebirds is mainly popular because it is always open, not so much because it is always good. Sometime about 1996 or so their quality took a nosedive. Odd fact about Freebirds: For a while (1998 or so I think) they were having a lot of trouble with drunk roudy frat guys late at night. As a result, they were looking at hiring a bouncer. That would make it the only burrito joint Ive ever heard of with a bouncer.  Users/EricKlein
       Yeah, totally.  And the 24hour Fitness is basically next to Sudwerk, although on 2nd Street.  Users/JaimeRaba
     I hate all the filler in my burritos, like rice.  Rice doesnt belong in there to me, but when you get it without rice, its all empty.  I need to get some of those LA burritos.  Users/RohiniJasavala
       I have seen the California burrito be the special of the day at El Mariachi.  I believe it is filled with fries and sour cream?  Users/MikeIvanov
         Wow, thats something different.  I guess it is like a potatoey burrito.  Taco Bell added potatoes to their burritos to make them more filling.  Users/RohiniJasavala
          A California Burrito typically includes french fries, guacamole, carne asada, and extra cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla.  Most SoCal residents would consider this to be a dietary staple.  Also, it must be ordered in Spanglish.  They taste divine.  Users/JillWeinstein
         I actually like Baldos in Vacaville. Granted, it is not in Davis...but its pretty close, theyre open 24hours, and they DO serve a California burrito w/ potatoes, carne asada, cheese, pico de gallo, etc. Try their carne asada fries and tacos. YUM. Also, dont bother going if you have issues w/ hole in the wall type places. This place isnt exactly the cleanest, although its gotten a lot better over the past few years.  Users/AliceCheng
     L.A.centric student transplants, an S.F. Mission District burrito is plenty good, and it would be great if Davis had such a place that was open late. A perfect example of how this works well in a college town is Tacos de Acapulco in Chico (open til 4:00 a.m., and lines snake out the door in the middle of the night). You L.A. supremacists should transfer back home and quit pontificating about L.A.s awesome food. Do cities of 60,000 in SoCal even have 24hour restaurants like what youre suggesting?  Users/RickEle
      Not to my knowledge in any city in wiki:WikiPedia:Ventura_County Ventura or wiki:WikiPedia:Santa_Barbara_County Santa Barbara Counties, which are around 25,000 to 175,000 pop.  There are, however, more restaurants of all types open to 10PM or 11 PM (at least in the bigger cities), which I think would really improve thin
gs in Davis. Users/BrentLaabs
       In SoCal, a city of 60,000 would probably contain at least one 24hour Mexican restaurant. My neighborhood in San Diego (one zip code) had 50,000 people, and we had not 1, but 4 24hour Mexican restaurants. Two of them were a block apart, walking distance from my house, and packed at all hours of the night. There is nothing better after a night of partying than late night tacos with all of your friends.
       wiki:WikiPedia:Isla_Vista,_California Isla Vista, pop. 18k has a burrito place open late for all the drunkards and the line is horrendously long. The food is overpriced and mediocre, but theyre open past two, goddamnit.  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen
     I like how its written as LA style Mexican food, when its really more Mexican style Mexican food.  By the way, Albertos is a company that started in San Diego, not LA.Users/RussellAnderson
       Mexican food isnt even constant as you move around Mexico. Its silly to talk about what is real Mexican when you have thousands of variant traditions you can choose from in Mexico. SoCal has its own take on Mexican. It might be closer to what they do in Baja than what we have up here, but it is still distinct from what youll find in Mexico. Thats just the nature of food traditions.WilliamLewis
   I think we could use an al pastor taco shed. Just a guy in a shack, cutting meat off one of those spinning vertical sticks, and applying said meat to a tortilla for $1.75 per taco. I think that guy would do well. MikeyCrews

 Authentic Italian Food 
  Authentic Italian Food  While Davis lacks restaurants in a general capacity, there seems to be a complete lack of good Italian food.  Pizza is not a substitute for a real Italian restaurant.  Users/BrandonKeene
  While I think Original Petes and Caffe Italia do a decent job, I dont think theyre quite up to North Beach standards.  Could Davis support a true Italian restaurant?  I bet it could.
     Caffe Italia is a poor excuse for an Italian restaurant. Users/ArianeMetz
  Okay, here is one I really have to chime in on.  I love Thai, Mexican, and deli food, of which we have plenty, but we soooo need a good Italian place.  Shit, if I wasnt so lazy I opened one up myself, and Im Eastern European. Users/Wayne Schiller Wayne Schiller
   Osteria Fasulo and Pasta both satisfy this quite well by being run by authentic Italians people.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
  I don’t know the name off the top of my head but there’s this little Italian restaurant in Village Homes its in the little office section by the commons area the food is absolutely fabulous its possibly the best Italian food I’ve had since I went to Italy proper.
   Osteria Fasulo?

 Authentic Irish Restaurant 
  Ever been?  Davis could use an infusion of REAL traditional Irish food/culture (outside of st. patricks day).  Why not go Irish?
   Your wish is (somewhat) granted: de Veres Irish Pub

 Barbecue 
  Straightup, no nonsense, slowcooked meat!
   I second that! Ive been craving Barbeque barbecue ever since moving to Davis, and Bicycle Rides biking to Woodland or Sacramento seems a bit too far for such an American culinary staple. Users/TomNelson
  Just across the causeway in West Sacramento, JRs Texas BarBQue just opened another location off the Enterprise exit from I80. Scott Wong

 Buffalo Wings 
   I have yet to find good spicy buffalo wings in California, much less Davis.  This area needs a restaurant that specializes in Buffalo Wings, like http://www.buffalowildwings.com.  I cant even find sauce I like at the grocery store.  If anyone knows of good wings in town, please let me know.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
    You can order Buffalo Wild Wings sauces online at their website. I grew up eating their wings in the east and brought some Parmesan Garlic sauce with me when I moved here from Florida. :) Users/inu
   In addition to not being all that good, the few places that have wings in Davis serve only the ballandsocket part of the wing. Whats up with that what do they do with the other half?!?  Users/CraigBrozinsky
   Oh dude...then you havent tried Original Buffalo Wings in San Rafael.  Its about an 1:15 trip from Davis, but Ill be damned if it isnt the best buffalo wings Ive ever had.  Ive made a special trip just to have them.  And yes, they have both halves of the wing.  )  Users/JulieEickhof
   See the Chicken Wings page.  Nothing has the variety of BWW, but for straight up hot wings, check out Sudwerk, which has excellent sauce and excellent breading.  The Graduate also has pretty fair ones. Users/TomGarberson

 Dim Sum 
  Dim Sum! There are enough Chinese people around arent there? Why dont they stop doing Japanese food and start selling some real Chinese food?
    Maybe we need some real Asians ;)  Users/ScottBiggart
    One of the current restaurants needs to try a dim sum menu on weekends. Id go just to avoid driving to Sac for it. Good dim sum?  Even better!  Users/KevinChin
    Im yet to go to dim sum in Sac and enjoy it. I recommend sticking with SF for that. No doubt.  Users/SamanthaSpada
    Im new to Davis and i definitely want to have dim sum on sunday morning, or just some dim sum to go as lunch!!  btw, where to go dim sum in sac? Users/waimeiYEUNG
    Technically Red Orchid is a dim sum restaurant. I cant speak for authenticity because my experience with dim sum is rather limited, but it was tasty. Users/KBathory
    My wife echoes this sentiment as well.  Correct me if Im wrong here, but per the above statements, and given the popularity of Dim Sum (particularly on weekends), wouldnt some restaurant do really well with this? Hard to understand why no one has even tried (please correct me if someone has tried in the recent past).

    Queen Sheba also has discounted gift certificates on www.restaurant.com Restaurant.com.  If you google coupon restaurant.com youll find some massive discounts.  Normally a $25off$45+order gift cert for is $10 on there, and theres always a 6080% off coupon code floating around on the internet (they change every couple of weeks, look for a current one).

 Mongolian Barbecue 
  I know Tokyo Japanese Restaurant used to have one. Sounded like a good place, sorry I missed it. Users/SteveDavison
   The Segundo Dining Commons has a Mongolian Wok thats available for both lunches and dinners. In case theres any confusion... its a giant heated griddle on which the chef throws ingredients youve chosen. Perhaps not the extensive selection that was available at Tokyo, but you should probably check it out. Users/AlphaDog

Korean Barbecue
 Manna Korean BBQ and maybe DosiRAK are the only serious options and those are both terrible. There really should be an option comparable to Oz in Sacramento. Users/RomanRivilis

Restaurants that deliver!
  Latenight delivery would be even better.  Yes, several pizza places and one Chinese restaurant have delivery (with exorbitant delivery fees), but it is absurd that, in a college town with so many of these restaurants, it is impossible to have sushi, Thai food, or burritos arrive magically at your residence when you have latenight hunger.  Even the nonpizza restaurants that do deliver (Kathmandu Kitchen, Ketmoree) stop delivery at 9 or 10pm.  Unbelievable, Davis!
  This is going to sound like a commercial but... I would love if the restaurants in town would participate in campusfood.com. This website is HUGE on the east coast and obviously you dont have to be a student to use it. Restaurants in the area can be sorted by type of cuisine, average cost of a meal, whether they deliver, etc. All of their menu items are online and you can place an order for pickup or delivery. Not only that, but the website will save your past orders, so say you order the same items every time from your local Chinese place, or have a buildyourown pizza with the perfect combination of toppings, you can click a button and order it again without having to go through the menu and put your order together from scratch each time. While the Wiki is a great place to read reviews (and sometimes menus), campus food provides a centralized tool for menus, sorting restaurants, ordering, and paying if you dont want to eat in the restaurant. Its probably targeted toward students who dont have transportation to pick up orders, but it is also super useful if you dont feel like waiting on the phone, risking a miscommunication about what you want to eat, or giving your credit card info to a stranger. users/MeggoWaffle
  I agree this would be really great to have here.  Ive used this elsewhere and it really is convenient.   Users/CovertProfessor

 Sitdown ice cream restaurant 
  A place where you can get breakfast, lunch or dinner, but where the emphasis is on the ice cream, with many options for sundaes and shakes.  Fentons Creamery is a good nonDavis example.   Users/CovertProfessor
   Agree totally! See my rant in the Departed Businesses section (for Marvellis/Leatherbys).  One would think this would be a winner in a family/campus centric community, but I guess the closest thing were going to get are the smaller places and frozen yoghourt shops.  I think if done properly, this type of establishment would do extremely well.  Users/OldDavis73

 Steak House 
  I swear that there is no place in Davis to get a decent steak.  How bout a nice steakhouse with (if this isnt too ironic) vegetarian options?   Users/CovertProfessor

 5 Guys 
The way theyre expanding, its possible. But I hate having to go to Vacaville or Natomas to get a burger from here. Almost as good as InNOut, but very different.  Users/sba

 UCD Coffeehouse 
  I want pancakes, bacon and fries at the Coffeehouse.  Users/JenndelaVega
  I agree, why dont they serve breakfast?  They would make mula!  Users/AnnieSirrah
  I was thinking that the Coffee House CoHo needs to expand and just take __over__ The Silo and sell the same sort of food they sold, but a little better for you.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Im with Phil on this taking over the silo talk. ASUCD should just take over Sodexhos contracts on campus completely.  Users/DanMasiel
    Sodexho is horriblefoodwise, and ethicswise.  I mean they were the company sued for providing food to prisoners that was so nasty and unhealthy that it allegedly violated prisoners civil rights.  I think the Coffeehouse should run all food on campus.  They run a surprisingly tight ship, good food, good prices and are extremely responsive to student needs.  Sodexho is a shover robot.  Users/JaimeRaba
    The revenue generated from students running the DCs and the Silo would be more than enough to greatly expand UNITRANS service and operating hours. I am going to have to talk to the FUCKers about this. Users/DanMasiel
    I agree and I really like the Burritos at the MU. Id like to see that kind of quality carried into other meals. However, Id like to point out that Sodexho hires many homeless and mentally ill people who would otherwise be S.O.L. (Thats an acronym for something that basically says that theyd have nowhere else to go)  Users/DanielDeisenroth
    The Breakfast Burritos are good, but kind of expensive. I would like an affordable breakfast entree at the CoHo!! Users/ArianeMetz
  Cell Phone reception inside the coffee house itself. It really shouldnt be that hard. The Mall here in Reno had a big problem with it, but then Cingular/ATT installed something and inside the mall you had perfect reception. I dunno, everyone has a damn cellphone on this campus.

 Vegan/Organic Foods Restaurant 
  My sister works at a raw, organic and vegan foods cafe in several locals in the Bay Area and they are looking to expand further. Davis would be the perfect location for something like this and I am hoping to generate some interest. http://www.cafegratitude.com  Users/myabrn
        Great idea.  My partner and I would love a place like that  CindiDrakeMartinez
        My husband and I will definitely support this cafe. Especially if it is brought in by the creators of Cafe Gratitude, which serves excellent food.  Lisa A.
        Id love this, too  minus the names for the dishes, which I find very distracting.   Users/CovertProfessor
        Ive been to Gracias Madre in San Fran and they were great! Nut cheese? Who woulda thought it would be so good! Just emailed them to express our interest. Fingers crossed!  Users/ConsciousConsumer
  You should definitely come and check out Monticello Seasonal Cuisine! It is located on G Street next to the Coop! They serve local organic food and  always have a lot of vegan options! KaitDancer
   When I went there, there was a vegan option or two.  Not even close to the same as having an entire vegan restaurant.   Users/CovertProfessor

 White Castle Burger 
  I want some new fast food here.
    The westernmost White Castle is in the central timezone, so keep wishing. Furthermore, White Castle is gross! I ate at one in Baltimore and felt sick all the next day.Users/RickEle
      White Castle for all its bad points seems to have discovered the tastiest configuration for dispensing fried poultry products, I am of course refering to the elusive http://www.whitecastle.com/_assets/images/food/menu/chicken_rings_lg.jpg Chicken Ring. Users/DavidReid
      I have a feeling your reaction was at least partly cultural.  Plenty of people who grow up in regions where sushi is uncommon complain of the same sickness when they first try sushi.  (Or, as they call it in many areas, bait).  On the other hand, plenty of people who are used to Krystal or White Castle see it as comfort food (or, as they call it in other areas, crap on a tile).  Users/JabberWokky
        Good thought...but youd be wrong to say my tastebuds and digestive system arent acculturated to East Coast and Ohio Valley grease, or to call me a sheltered Californian. I try new restaurants almost weekly, and Ive traveled all over the place, including extensively in the deep South. Moreover, Long John Silvers fried foods soak through four napkins no matter where you are in the USA. And the Arthur Treachers (r.i.p.) that I ate at in Baltimore was no less nasty. Of any place Ive been to, the place where restaurants require the more iron digestive system is Klamath Falls, Oregon. Eat at Mollies, Pollys, Starvin Marvins, Davids Home of the Brawny Burger, and Sams Place all in two days time and tell me how you feel.Users/RickEle

Lees Sandwiches
 As of Fall 2013, we have a Lees Deli in UMall, so this is more or less resolved.
 Am I the only one who wishes we could have a http://www.leessandwiches.com Lees ? I miss so much the 2 dollar sandwiches made from fresh french bread, veggies, and good Vietnamese style meat that could stuff me.  I think with the amount of people who love that sort of food, and the very cheap price of the sandwiches, Davis could support a Lees, or something like it. Users/ascapoccia
    Sunrise Restaurant has Vietnamese sandwiches for $2.50 ($2.72 with tax) each. Users/hankim
 Actually, I would like better serviced Vietnamese pho places ::cough: pho bac:: But yeah, cheap Vietnamese sandwiches, do you think the CoHo will add that on their pho menu? That would be nice. Users/geezlouisexyz

A bar with decent cocktails
 Considering the current cocktail renaissance and the fine offerings available in nearby cities, the dearth of wellexecuted, mature cocktails in Davis bars and eateries is something that should be addressed. The fact that a search of Davis Wiki page on cocktails largely plugs the Wicky Wacky Woo speaks volumes. If this town treats wine and beer well, why cant we get some decent cocktails in town?


 Bring back certain food(s) 
 Old Froggys burgers 

 Old G Street Menu 
  G Street Pub used to have a great pub grub menu that was made all the better by having halfpriced apps from 3PM7PM everyday. Now the menu has been upscaled to Enzos fancy tastes. Bring back the Buffalo Wings and fries. Artichoke spinach dip just doesnt mix well with PBR on tap... Users/TonyMagagna
     There is definitely a lack of good happy hour food specials in town.  Right now the best thing going is Little Prague, oddly enough.  The $2 sausage or the $6 sampler are both awesome, but it feels a little too elegant for my simple pubfood tastes.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

 Panaderia
We need an authentic panaderia. I have to go all the way to woodland or west sac to satisfy my cravings. arent there enough davis residents with a taste for Hispanic breads and pastries to support a locally owned panaderia?

 Mens Clothing Store 
Also see Clothing Stores.
   Even I, a girl, have noticed the lack of guys clothing options here in Davis.  Lets have at least one malethemed clothes store.  Users/TerryCliff
   James Anthony and the Gap both sell mens clothing.  Users/JackHaskel
   This is seriously a considerable problem for all of Davis men in this town are in serious trouble when it comes to clothing! While The Savvy Shoppe has offered a small step forward with their singular rack of Paper Denims and tshirts for guys, there is a ridiculously disproportionate number of Rikiesque 30+ womens boutiques.  Users/GrahamKolbeins
   Savvy Shoppe is currently building a mens only store next to their current location.  Rumors have it there will be something in the store to do with alcohol.  Users/TracyPerkins
      Street Savvy has been built, however, you wont find much there besides polo shirts, tshirts, and jeans.
          NOTE: This is one example of a wish from this wishlist that was actually granted. But wouldnt you know it....The wish was ungranted within a years time as these stores already went outta business. I dont think that theres enough brodawgs and hoochiemamas to keep clothing stores open for people who wanna dress like Elimidate contestants. This redeems my faith in Davis! Users/RickEle
   What we need is a Buffalo Exchange or another comparable secondhand store.  People could buy and sell their old clothes.  Users/IanRamsay
          I agree very strongly that a Buffalo Exchange could succeed in this city. If a city of 60,000 has a very low percapita rate of thriftstores but a rather high proportion of hip indierockers, there is a market untapped. Somebody write the Buffalo Exchange people. Propose that they move into the former Savvy Shoppe and Street Savvy, and that they hire a contractor to knock out part of the wall between the two. Its a nobrainer! Users/RickEle
   Real Men dont need clothes. Neither do Real Women.

 PlusSize Womens Clothing Store 
Also see Clothing Stores.
   Of course we know that everybody in Davis is physically fit, but on the off chance that there might be someone larger than a size 3 wandering around the streets, its too bad that they have to drive in to Woodland or Sacramento to find clothes.
      Although, ANY clothing would help.  Okay, now Davis has a few more fashion boutiques.  But aside from Gottschalks and the Gap, theres nowhere for guys really to shop at all.  Davis has a zillion trinket stores and Chinese restaurants.  It even has an automall.
    Samiras is one of the few places in town that I know of that carries nontiny (womens) clothing sizes.   Users/JevanGray

 Real Asian supermarket 
Also see Ethnic Markets.
  Davis needs a real Asian food store, like the ones you find on Stockton Blvd in Sac. If there are enough Asians here to support the Old Teahouse, theres enough to support such a store.  Cheap fresh seafood, cheap shitake mushrooms, chili sauces...drool...speaking of which, Davis also needs a gay Learn to Dance dance club because you cant dance in coffee shops  Users/GaryMa
     Gary, have you been to that Kims Mart Korean place next to Silver Dragon?  Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Yeah, but that places selection is actually inferior to the former Harvest Market.  And the prices are EXTREMELY high.  The Asian markets on Stockton Blvd and also Broadway are BIG stores that are full service.  Id be all for a true Asian supermarket.  There used to be a Ralphs near 8th and L streets, and its a supermarket that is _completely_ empty.  This would be perfect for an Asian store.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
     Davis used to have a much larger Asian food market in the space now occupied by Peets Coffee/Noahs Bagels in the The Marketplace Pig Mall, but it eventually folded for lack of business. They got a fair amount of business... just not enough to pay the bills. I suspect that if business were to improve dramatically at Kims Mart the owner would be encouraged to look for a larger space and increase her inventory. Supply and demand, you know! Users/AlphaDog
     I concur, in Sac there used to be this Asian version of SafeWay, it was amazing! I cant remember where it was but they had some of the awesomest rare stuff. Users/JamesHaile
     Users/MattHh Apparently there is progress on this, Kims Mart is moving into the space of Pallens Martial Arts (twice as big?) who is moving into the space of Davis Bike Exchange and Pet Cetera.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

 Best Buy 

Computer accessories, video games, a huge DVD selection, CDs, and game consoles for you to play.
  We need a Frys more than this, Frys is much more complete and I think most people in Davis can handle it.
  Best Buy is neither best nor a buy IMHO.  My three choices are, in order, Frys, Newegg, and ebay.

 Maternity Clothes 
    Id like a store that sells a decent selection of new maternity clothes. The consignment store, Just Kidding, in the E Street Plaza, has a small rack in the back of used items. Target usually carries maternity wear, but Woodland has a horrible selection (theyve been out of nearly everything in sizes 612). Both of the Gottschalks, as well as JCP and Mervyns in County Fair Mall do not have maternity clothes. Users/NoelBruening
   For a town of this size, with so many pregnant women around (I see at least 5 every time I leave the house), its almost appalling that there is no place to find maternity clothes.  We cant even sew our own, because there is no fabric store! (see my comment below).   Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

 A Fabric Store 
  How can Davis NOT have a fabric store with as many people who are into DIY in this day and age?  I do not consider Pincushion a fabric store.  Yes, they have fabric, but very little selection.  Plus, they do not sell any sewing related supplies that are not related to quilting.  A real fabric store has a large selection of many different kinds of fabric and any sewing supply you could think of.  Pincushion is just what it says it is: a boutique.   Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle
  How can a town this size accept driving to Woodland or Dixon to some Walmart every time they need fabric for a kids Halloween costume or class project?  Its ridiculous.  Users/AllisonEriksen
   As a note  JoAnn Fabrics in Woodland has much better material and crafting supplies than Walmart.  Take County Road 98 to Main Street; its on the corner.
   Davis used to have a fabric store, but didnt provide sufficient business for it to survive. Perhaps now that DIY is once again popular, some frustrated parent might start one! Users/AlphaDog
 Pincushion Boutique off Pena and Fifth has quilting supplies, and fabric. ~Users/JaniceGutshall
  We really need this! Maybe if a bead store can survive here, the right fabric store could, too.  Users/chrisfmichaels
  Pincushion Boutique has reopened to the public.  True, Pincushion does not carry synthetic fabrics for apparel or home decor, but it does carry thousands of bolts of 100% cotton for quilting, crafting, and clothing.  The Pincushion also carries quilting patterns, kits, notions, batting, and a limited selection of new release quilting books. Pincushion Boutique

Improve Manor Plaza
  It was really nice having a fullsized grocery store in this plaza.  Dollar tree is cool if I need candles or paper plates, but a grocery store would be much more useful.  It would serve colgate/chestnut park neighborhoods well to have something within walking distance again.  I also think it would be really nice to have some good coffee here.

 Transportation 
Also see Transportation.
 Bicycle taxis 
  Amsterdam has http://www.amsterdam.info/transport/biketaxi/ them. Downtown Austin uses several rickshaws. Chico and Minneapolis all have humanpowered vehicles to get people around. Why not Davis? For the nations most Bicycles bicyclefriendly city, this seems like a nobrainer to me. Users/SteveDavison
     Update: Davis does have Pedicab bike taxi service now.

 Biking 
  More bike paths. Were conditioned to think of the bicycle as a secondary, impractical, nonserious transportation vehicle. It doesnt have to be this way. Imagine a city in which the roles of bicycles and cars were reversed there were a few auto roads among the network of bike paths. Unless we have vision (like the forward thinking students in the 70s), we wont move forward. We must stop being complacent.
  Bicycles Bicycle paths which go all the way to neighboring communities (Dixon, Winters, Woodland, and Sacramento). Not having such paths keep me from visiting them. (Yes, I know Pole Line goes to Woodland, but there needs to be a West route too). Users/SteveDavison
    Even without a bike path that covers the entire route from Davis to Sacramento, the trip is still relatively easy. The country road isnt bad, the path over the Causeway is great for biking, and Sacramento has a pretty extensive bike path through the city. The only place thats even remotely bad for biking is West Capitol through West Sac, but even that isnt bad  it has bike paths and sidewalk routes.  Users/MoTorres
  We need a decent bike lane on Fifth Street, especially the portions that travel through downtown!  At night its a very bad ride for bicycles.
    I used to care, but nowadays its just not a big deal to cruise down 5th in the right lane. Especially if Ive got a light.
    This is soon in the works I believe.  Though Im not sure Id want to see Fifth Street reduced to a single lane, I think that will cause problems down the line.  Especially if the Police Popo set up another sobriety checkpoint in the middle of Russell at night.
  Better Bike Paths bike path maintenance. There are some big potholes on Russell Blvd. west of campus, and the Orchard Rd. path south of La Rue Park has so many tree roots under the asphalt its like being on a roller coaster.  A lot of paths could also do with being repaved  even without potholes its a ridiculously bumpy ride.
    But what about the historical importance of these potholes? Users/BarnabasTruman
  I appreciate that the UC is always working to improve the campus, but the bike lane along hutchison as they work on the parking garage has been a disaster for some time now. I regularly see bikers shooting out across busy traffic to get to the other side. I cringe when I see that, and hope that there isnt a terrible accident there before they are done. Id like to see the UC spend some more effort before starting on big construction projects trying to find a way to look out for displaced bikers. Im not asking for miracles, just a little more forethought. Users/EricKlein
  Theres a straight bike path which leads from the Orchard Park apartments through Russell Park, and through La Rue Park. There is then a 20foot stretch of grass before it connects to the La Rue Road underpass which leads around the Segundo Dining Commons and continues on to the heart of campus. This is a major artery connecting these residential neighborhoods to UCD. They need to replace this tiny section of grass with a bike path segment; its so obvious to anyone who bicycles, which unfortunately seems not to be anyone who designs these things. Users/SteveDavison
  Between the Segundo Dining Commons and the ARC is a solitary sidewalk which bikers frequently use, as it is the only way to get to and from the ARC without hopping the curb. All it needs is 5 feet of bike lane and the problem is fixed!
  BIKE PARKING AT THE AMTRAK STATION  the number of bikes parked at the train station has reached record numbers  hundreds of bikes are scattered around the station grounds without any secure (i.e., a permanent structure to lock your bike to) parking. The city needs to provide bike racks, soon!! Users/JeaninePfeiffer
  The whole road, including both bike lanes, of Olive Drive, really needs some work. There are potholes, cracks, bumps, sunken manholecovers, and almost always piles of debris. Ive also come across broken glass. In addition, in some places the cars parked there make it impossible to ride safely in the bike lane.

A new Skatepark!
The skatepark which is in the center of the Community park is hideous. It is excessively small and not very fun. The people who designed it seem to have no knowledge of how to work with concrete and/or design a skatepark. This is clearly evident to anyone whos ever gone there. There are lumps on what should be smooth surfaces, the transitions are either too tight , or in the case of the bowl, so shallow that there is no way to pump to get back up to the lip on the other side. I implore the city to make a park that is not only safe, but fun!!

A Velodrome
With the Bicycling Hall of Fame, UCDs championship squad and the sheer number of fixed gears riding through town, it seems only obvious that Davis get a Velodrome.  It doesnt need to be anything fancy, but on the lines of http://www.ridethetrack.com/ Hellyer Park in San Jose.  Im all for it.

 Driving 
  I think there needs to be a better stop sign at the intersection of Marina Circle and Jerome St. in West Davis.  No one who doesnt live there can see it due to the high turn radius and the trees in the way.  I may go to a city council meeting to tell someone about this because every single one of my friends runs the stop sign the first time they drive through there and somebody might get hurt.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Davis is renewing threats to give tickets to people who park parking space style at the end of cul de sacs, rather than parallel parking.  Most of the houses at the end of cul de sacs have little to no nearby street parking.  They should let us park this way, since its been done this way for at least 40 years, but I think the trash collectors are complaining because they cant get their trucks close enough to the cans.  Poor things.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
  There needs to be MORE THAN ONE STREET SIGN PER INTERSECTION.  (Yes, I know, there are usually two.  Regardless, theyre inadequate.)  Too small, set too far back from the street, totally useless at night when moving with any speed. Users/ChrisTakemura ct
  A few different things could be done to help out The Worst Intersection in Davis. Put in another road a halfmile south that reaches Mondavi area; give Olive another outlet; fix the timing on the traffic lights.  Users/EricTalevich
   There have been numerous attempts over the years to improve this horrendous intersection (specifically, the subway underpass into downtown), that hasnt changed since 1917.  Yes, you read that right: 1917.  As in almost 100 years ago http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis,_California.  The main artery into downtown has not changed since the population of Davis was less than 1,000.  The last attempt (I believe), was done in the mid90s.  A very tasteful, well crafted expansion was proposed (my opinion of course), and put on the ballot.  If failed, due to the locals who played the population with scare tactics, spouting asinine statements such as big rigs will start coming downtown! traffic will increase downtown! Itll be like a local freeway! So, the measure failed.  Sound familiar? Voters being frightened off by a few citizens drumming up questionable facts to scare off the populace? See Covell Village.  Meanwhile, the facts remain that emergency vehicles could potentially not get through this bottleneck if/when it floods in the winter (this has happened).  During peak traffic hours, anyone whos ever tried to get through this intersection can be stuck for 10 minutes or more.  The bike tunnel is great, but in my humble opinion, this continues to be the single worst traffic spot in the whole city.  The premise of slowing people down through the intersection by creating gridlock just isnt the right way to do things.  I would also qualify my remarks by saying I am completely for most every conceivable effort to retain anything linking Davis to its history.  However, to me, the argument against expanding this intersection rings more of a misplaced perspective on city history (see historic potholes: http://cityofdavis.org/cdd/cultural/30years/chapt10.cfm) than of a valued piece of our past.  I realize now that the site has been cited in the National Register of Historic Places (http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/), there is little chance of it ever being tampered with (http://cityofdavis.org/bicycles/tour.cfm).  This being said, I still truly believe that, done tastefully, CORRECTLY, that there could be a site that fits the city in both appearance and function.  I sincerely invite any discussion/opposition to any of the above.
  It might also help to have realistic speed limits.  With the exception of downtown, you could safely raise most every speed limit in the city by a good 10 miles per hour.  Users/MeganCurtis
    Every few years people try to do this and the Townies get up in arms about it.  There was an attempt several years ago to the F Street from 5th Street to Covell Boulevard raised above 25 mph, and it failed in part due to a picture of a basset hound in bunny ears.  Users/RogerClark
    Even now with the 25 mph speed limit on F St. people typically drive at 30  35 mph. Ive been passed on both the left and the right because I was driving 25  30 mph. What is the big rush? Users/PaulThober PT

 Ban Driving Downtown 
  Ban driving downtown.  Develop the road into a more narrow foot and bike traffic lane, and open up room for more local business development.  Driving downtown is ineffective at best, and we should focus on parking structures instead. Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Yeah, I think thats not a bad idea.  It would be really cool if E Street, F and G Streets were just big pedestrian access areas, with a big bike lane and maybe busonly access.  (Or maybe a light rail?)  Users/JaimeRaba
          What about the pizza places there that have delivery drivers? Theyd be cut off. Lightrail seems a bit excessive. Users/omgstarkitty
     Id support this (especially the parking structures part) if some other concessions were made to nonbikeowners. I dont know what those concessions would be, though, so yeah, a fairly good idea. Just dont make anything too far from driving access (i.e. more than two blocks). Users/RoyWright
     Im definitely with Philip here.  Ive been wishing for 10 years (since I worked downtown) that theyd do this.  The core of downtown is much too small to adequately serve cars, and its downright dangerous to walk around down there with all the drivers who cant seem to figure out how to safely operate a motor vehicle.  Also, making use of outside seating at any given restaurant/cafe is only nice until the next exhaustspewing earsplittinglyloud car drives by.  Plus, have you ever noticed how the pace and quality of your conversations with your family/friends is affected by the vehicle traffic roaring by as you walk down the sidewalk?  This is not a healthy way to live. Users/GrahamFreeman
     If cars were banned downtown they would need to build A LOT more parking to make up for it. And WHERE exactly would you guys propose they put this extra parking?? Users/ArianeMetz
    K Street mall in sacramento is a segment of K street between 7th street and 12th street that allow scars to cross K street, but K street itself is open only to foot and light rail traffic.  It would be interesting if Davis did this to one or more streets.  Also, Ive noticed that parking has opened up quite alot since they implemented to new parking rules.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
        If any one street could be turned into a pedestrianonly street like Sactos K Street Mall, it should be G Street. Of course, that would impact traffic quite a bit on F. And be realistic, folks...Youll never get driving banned entirely downtown as long as the citys busiest freeway ramps are accessible to the core of the city via the tunnel on Richards
         Which is why the parking garage would go on the northwest corner of The Worst Intersection in Davis. Then people could just walk through the tunnel.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Ive always thought converting parts of 4th street to bike only would both be a nice way to encourage reduced driving downtown and provide a bike alternative to fifth street (it would allow fifth street to continue operating as is and bikes could have a whole street to take into downtown and campus).  Plaza areas between C and F street could serve businesses and extend space for farmers market.  Portions could serve as additional parking as well.
   Agreed. Im always tempted to run the noob bikers over when they try to squeeze in on 5th... maybe from now on Ill blast my horn at them and maybe teach them a lesson. But really, its not that downtown needs to be carfree, it needs to be stupidpersonfree. I suppose thats an even taller order but if you run a stop sign on your bike or cross by foot in streams rather than grouping together I promise to feel no remorse making you blend in with the asphalt. Maybe allowing cars on E and B only, each becoming a 1way street (E going south towards Richards, B going north toward 5th) connected by 1st and 5th (which would remain as they are) might provide some relief but those streets are already pretty busy. Also in that case, there WOULD need to be more exterior parking, though a metered parking garage (especially if built below ground, rather than above it) would likely suffice. Where to put it, though, I couldnt think of. Users/KBathory
 Bathory states a lot of win. I think this is a horrible idea of banning driving downtown. What about the handicapped? Are they no not to see movies? Sing some karaoke at Woodstock?

 Parking 
  A parking district around Cuarto. The school decided that freshmen cant bring cars to campus. Guess what  they still do bring cars, and they keep them permanently parked in the public parking spaces at Oxford Circle park and on all of the nearby streets. (All this while the campus owned parking lots for the dorms are practically empty because nobody can get a permit to park there). A 3hour parking district would help greatly so that my friends could drive over and visit me. Users/KenBloom
   There IS a public parking lot by Cuarto. Its across the street from Guava Lane on Wake Forest Drive, and you can park there for up to 3 hours. Users/TomNelson
  Parking downtown is a nightmare, especially if you are a resident. Parking from C street up to A street should be resident parking only, and if the city wants to keep parking regulation, then it should only be onehour parking so that people dont come and park for their twohour classes and take the spots that the residents who live in the area need. Users/CCTush
  Id like to see an actual fullsize parking garage downtown where you can park for more than 3 hours. It would be better for tourism and downtown business because people will have time to actually window shop, and theyll probably spend more because they can spend more worryfree time downtown.

  Id support some parking meters downtown if the limit was at least 3 hours. Finding a space easily and getting to a class on time in a semiemergency is worth throwing down a buck or so now and then at some places close to campus (maybe the farmers market), and the MU structures pay spots arent enough for the whole campus.  Users/EricTalevich
  The fact that parking meters only go up to 50 minutes, leaving no time for returning from class and not taking longer classes into account is ridiculous.
     I think thats the idea.  They dont want you to park there to go to class.  Users/RogerClark
  There is a solution to the parking problem. Hint: It has two wheels. Users/SteveDavison

   Seriously I cant see why people have to drive the maybe 3 miles (tops!) to campus when we have a fairly decent bus system that most of them can use for free. You can bike anywhere in town in 15 minutes (I go from my house in North Davis to work in South Davis by bike most days and it takes me about that long) and most students live within a mile of campus. How can you not take a 15 minute walk when you consider all the time and money you spend on gas, maintenance, and parking for a car? Just dont bring your cars here! Its cheaper and good for everyone.   Users/KBathory
  Ban Parking Between 2 am and 4 am city wide. This would solve several problems addressed here. And it would limit the creation of defacto dorms in areas where single family homes were planned. Students are generally very respectful of the areas they live. However when too many are concentrated in one place Animal House behaviors can result. If there is any appropriate place for this, it certainly isnt a family neighborhood. I would also be curious if this might cause rents to drop a bit, but I could also imagine it might cause them to go up.  Bottom line, people should only have cars if they can park them on property they own or are renting. Thats how it was in the town I grew up in and I think we could try it here.  Users/KirkParrott
 I wish TAPS would offer parking permits by the hour. I have to travel occasionally on my oncampus job, and I hate having to pay $6.00 for the entire day when I am only parked for my 1 hour class! At least make some meters that have more than a 45 min limit!! When you consider the price of gas (which the university does not reimburse) having to pay extra is ridiculous. Users/ArianeMetz
         Check out the COMET machineo thing that TAPS put out (there should be info on their website).  Its still in the trial stage, and you have to put a deposit on it and pay for the time you put on it, but it just counts down as you park and you dont have to worry about paying the meter.  Also, there are 2hour meters in some lots on campus (north structure near the MU, west structure by the new TAPS office, Lot 5 by Solano Park/Wyatt/UClub/Arbo, Lot 43 by the Silo just to name a few).  Users/AliceCheng
  I wish there was a special parking pass for people who work downtown, or a special lot that we could park in. Sometimes I just dont feel like biking or the weather is bad and I dont want to get my uniform wet. I love to bike, but I hate getting multiple parking tickets because I am unable to move my vehicle.  Users/SydnieMcGuire

Rail Transit
  Connect to Sacramentos light rail system.  Then continue the light rail up to Woodland (there are already tracks laid down). Users/isoquinophlex
   If you go to http://www.sacrt.com Sacramento Regional Transits web site, running light rail into Davis is in their 20 year plan.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

  Run Amtrak trains on time.  Run more frequent and faster service on the Capitol Corridor. Run direct trains to San Francisco without a bus or BART connection.Users/isoquinophlex

Teleporter
  Vanish and perhaps zap you to Lake Tahoe or the beach.
  Make it compatible with groups of people, clothing, and gear.
  Do I really have to state the obvious that its convenient and very desirable?

 UC Davis Underground 
  Going with the whole London theme, how about a subway system throughout the UC Davis Campus, then potentially the city itself. I know its a pipe dream, just wanted to get it out there. Users/mperkel
  This is only a dream, but instead of using money to build more parking structures, cant the school build underground tunnels around campus to avoid the winter cold or summer heat.  Of course, biking underground could be an issue. Users/geezlouisexyz

A Second Downtown
Davis has grown a lot in size and population since I got here in 1979.  This has created pressures on the quaint residential properties in the core area, it has increased traffic into the downtown area, parking is getting harder and harder to find, and from what I have heard from several shop owners, the downtown property landlords are ruthless.  In addition, the idea of closing selected downtown streets has come and gone several times, and was even tried once, on a limited basis (oneway streets, if I recall correctly).  And, admit it Davis, the ratio of bike to car traffic in downtown is no where as high as it once was.  Finally, the pressure to build big malllike facilities (barren retail depots that offer nothing in the way of community and culture) has been a big issue lately.

My solution is to set aside an area where a second downtown could develop and establishing guidelines for making it happen.  A Downtown II has many possibilities, most I see as good.  Here are the pros and cons, listed together, and in no particular order.  You can decide which are pros and which are cons and of course since this is a wiki you can add more items and can add observations to the already listed items.
 1. It would create some competition with the current landlocked (in the sense that it is surrounded by developed neighborhoods and cannot grow) downtown, something that should lower the rents.
 2. New buildings would be modern, energy efficient, accessible, and safer (up to date on all fire and earthquake codes).
 3. One could make the whole thing car, bike, and pedestrian friendly at the outset, instead of fighting existing business interests and remodeling existing buildings and infrastructure.  A real pedestrian zone, for instance.  Perhaps the new downtown could incorporate elements of Village Homes.
 4. Shopping commutes would be shorter since people would be more likely to shop very locally rather than generally locally.  This would take pressure off the Russell Blvd underpass problem.  Shopping commutes might even start to favor biking and walking again.
 5. Over time people would come to favor one downtown over the other.  While that could lead to a dualculture Davis (Multiculturalism is good, right?) and some people might not care for that, it has many good points.  One downtown might become more studentoriented, for example, and as a result more studentoriented businesses (live music, clothing, etc.) may spring up.  The other town may be more family or homeowner oriented, with shops, galleries, and entertainment that support those demographics.  There are advantages to having shops that complement each other being close to each other, even while they may be competing with each other.  Of course, over time friendly rivalries could develop, or even unfriendly rivalries, hypothetically to the point the NewTown and OldTown propose splitting Davis in two, but thats a pretty far out there possibility and in any advent it would probably take over 100 years to get to that point, and anyway by then Davis will be under water.

Where should the Bums go?
Why doesnt davis have a shelter for the homeless?
I know that local churches help out every once in a while, but why isnt there a mission house where street people can get counseling and guidance to get back on their feet?
some may say that there arent bums in davis, but i see them all the time loitering around the various grocery complexes and occasionally downtown.
A shelter can be an asset to the community and an opportunity for others to contribute to their fellow comrades wellbeing.

     Davis Community Meals provides a variety of services to the homeless, including a cold weather/emergency shelter in addition to their regular shelter.  Services are available, but some of the regulars that you see on the street prefer not to go to a shelter (due to mental illness or because they are addicts who would dont want to stay in a place where sobriety is mandatory.   Users/CurlyGirl26

   Their cold weather/emergency shelter does not require sobriety  just an ability to function in a community environment.  Users/Angel.York

Panera Bread
 Im dreaming here, but it would be just so wonderful if there was a Panera Bread in Davis http://www.panerabread.com/cafes/find.php, too. Everything is healthy, tasty and affordable; their coffee is delicious, and unlike Peets Coffee there is no time limit regarding internet use. Its a great place to study as well, alone or in group, regardless how long you stay. And light! The abundance of natural light in their shop is great. Users/PassingThrough

 Trader Joes 

A Trader Joes arrived in 2010, fulfilling the wishes below.

  Trader Joes would be a nice thing to have. They have lots of reasonably priced wine, and they have the best prepackaged tomato roasted red pepper soup... yum.  Users/LauraCochrane
     Trader Joes would not be nice in Davis. We have our own local store that sells similar things that Trader Joes does. It is called The CoOp. Why would you want your town be like every other?   Users/RobRoy
     I think the Coop would continue to make Davis unique, even if it had a Trader Joes.  But then again, lots of other towns have Coops.  Take Sacramentos Coop, for example its a bit nicer in many respects, yet the prices are lower and the organic selection is bigger. I think a little healthy competition would help the Coop out a little bit.  Thats been the case in Sacramento.  I think the Davis Coop is a little set in its ways and in its state of cleanliness.  If you ever read the Coop newsletter, Im a little confounded with their fairly frequent dismissals of very good ideas and recommendations. But I remain proCoop. Im just not antiTrader Joes. I think a good spot for a TJs would be out around Mace/Chiles.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
    Sorry, but I personally really want Trader Joes here. They have stuff that you just cant get at the CoOpfor example, Twobuck Chuck. Not to mention their wonderful assortments of import foods, etc. Trader Joes would add so much to this town.  Users/DougBarbieri rdb
    Id like a Trader Joes as well.  I really like the food there, and free samples!  Users/MonikaLin
    I agree with Users/JaimeRaba, a little competition should be good for the CoOp. If this town can support two Nuggets within three miles of each other, it can support a TJ and Coop.  Users/KrisFricke
    I third that one. I think the abandoned Ralphs on East 8th St would be a perfect TJs spot, and nothing beats peanutbutterfilled pretzels.  Users/KenNeville
    I recall reading that there are actual plans to build a TJs at 8th and Pole Line. I for one welcome this  they carry many kinds of kosher food that I cant get at the Coop. I just wish they would have opened it already, so it will be open before I graduate  Users/KenBloom
    A Trader Joes would be nice, but I just dont think it would be economically feasible at this time. Since Ive moved here two grocery stores, Ralphs and the place in the Umall, have gone under. Neither was that great, but they were in pretty good locations.  Users/ToNu
      The Harvest Market (formerly in the UMall, and before that in the Russell Rite Aid building) did not go under. They were doing extremely well according to one of the owners. However, CostPlus made an offer they couldnt refuse.  Essentially they were purchased out of existence, and the family running Harvest Market got to retire in style.  Oh well, at least some good came out of it.  The Ralphs went out of business because they too closely duplicated grocery stores that were in a better location for most of Davis. A Trader Joes, however, would not be duplicating anything. However, Trader Joes has scoffed at locating there. They feel it is not a high enough traffic area. But they dont realize is this:  build it, and they will come.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
   I think the Food Coop is quite anti Trader Joes... and probably for a good reason. I think a Trader Joes would greatly hurt the horribly inefficient Coops business. But perhaps the Coop would step up to the challenge and actually improve. I guess either way would be good for us.  Users/JevanGray
   Write to Trader Joes Company, PO Box 5049, Monrovia, CA 91017 and tell Trader Joes to build in Davis. I miss having this type of grocery store around.  Its like a better version of Nugget, and a cheaper version of the Coop, with more stuff.. Users/JuliaNiazov
  I know that Trader Joes isnt exactly the same as The CoOp or Nugget, but between those two I think we have most things covered.  I like that Nugget is a local chain and a very decent one, too. There would be too much overlap with a Trader Joes as well, IMO.  Users/IrenePark
  The Peoples Republic of Davis would definitely keep a Trader Joes in business. Davis Food CoOp The Coop has plenty of Hippies diehards so it wouldnt lose business, and a Trader Joes would be a good middle ground from Nugget & The CoOp. It also has things neither store has... like mochi. Users/MichelleAccurso
   Very fresh mochi can be found at wiki:sacramento:OsakaYa up in wiki:sacramento:Front Page Sac. Users/KevinChin
  (Kims Mart sells mochi, or so I thought.) Will the Peoples Republic of Davis PRD keep the existing stores also in business if a Trader Joes moves in?  Should we move towards being able to purchase anything we could possibly want within the city limits so we dont have to go way out to Woodland, Dixon, or Sacramento? Down that path leads to a plethora of stores.  Or should we find a balance of goods we can purchase in Davis and those we are willing to go to a big city to buy? . . .  To be honest, if there were a Trader Joes in Davis I would probably not shop at the Nugget so much as I do now, depending on the new TJs location in relation to where I live in Davis.  So... it kinda makes me sad, I mean, I like TJs a lot. I also like the Nugget because once I move from here I probably wont ever see or shop at one again.  TJs, on the other hand, will be everywhere (uh, everywhere else). So Im actually of mixed feelings on this.  Users/IrenePark
  More than anything else, I would like to see a Trader Joes in Davis. I dont care what part of Davis its in, so long as I dont have to drive 15+ miles each way to get there.  Of particular note, the http://www.tastybite.com Tasty Bite Indian food boxed meals are excellent for camping. Users/AlexPomeranz
   Check the International Food Market (or another international food store) for Tasty Bite type stuff. Im pretty sure they have them, and for cheaper than youd find at Trader Joes or the Davis Food Coop (which does have them, but expensively). Users/JessicaLuedtke
  Ashland, Oregon, a university town with demographic similarities to Davis, supports a CoOp grocer AND and independent whole/natural food grocer, plus a Safeway and a nearby Rays Food Place in an adjoining town of 1,000 population, despite itself only having a population of 19,000.

Car Sharing
  Davis needs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_sharing car sharing!  This is something I think could seriously take off here, with so many http://www.daviswiki.org/Carfree_in_Davis carfree individuals in Davis and the communal spirit prevalent in the city.  Car sharing is a great thing for those who dont own cars but want to use one every once in a while. Users/isoquinophlex
  I totally second this!  I typically bike, but it would be great to get a car from time to time, like when I move in/out of apartments.  I welcome the competition against Enterprise. Users/geezlouisexyz

 Bikes 
  Half the bike path lights are burnt out on the bend just west of where Orchard Rd. crosses 113, but most bike paths around town could do with better lighting.  It can be a serious hazard if you hit a large pothole or broken branch in the semidarkness. These have apparently been replaced, because theyre fine now. Now if they could JUST REPAVE THE BUMPY PATH!!! The big gaps in the path were patched summer 07, and the timing on the traffic light at Arthur was improved for bikes in fall 07.  Now if we could only do something about the rough pavement on the Russell Bike Path west of 113 and Orchard Park Drive between The Domes and La Rue Road!  (Dec 2007)

 AmericanStyle Buffet 
The new Segundo Dining Commons has all kinds of food to please all manner of tastes. The salad bar has what I missed from Fresh Choice, at a comparable price too.
  I also have to comment that Davis needs more places like smorgasbords, or places like Fresh Choice. It would make sense to have a place like that in a college town. For one thing that place would see lots of business. For Davis being so openminded and liberal, they seem to be somewhat restrictive when it comes to having more affordable places to eat at and shop at.  I really dont believe that a person should have to spend on average of $7.00 for a meal, thats too expensive, I dont care who you are, thats too expensive, they need things to be in the range of $4.00$5.00. Users/MikeMele

    Being liberal does not necessarily mean living in an affordable manner, they just know how to better help people with less money than those people themselves.  Users/hankim
    I eat out all of the time and I must say that there are LOTS of options under $5.50 and plenty of options in the $35 range. JH
  It would be nice to see an American style buffet place, but Fresh Choice kinda sucks and tricks people into thinking that buffetsaving money. It costs $8 for lunch + $1 for drink, has few meat options (e.g., 10 miniature meatballs per gallon of sauce), and serves food easily prepared at home. In terms of quality, their best dishes are easily trumped by the canned and frozen food equivalents you can buy for cheaper at Food for Less. In contrast, many Chinese and Indian restaurants have buffets for less than $7, and have a full selection of meats and foods difficult to prepare at home. Users/CraigBrozinsky

    Still cheaper (depends) and better tasting than the Dining Commons.

 Coworking Space 
There must be enough independent, selfemployed, workfromhome, creative people in town to support a coworking space.... anyone interested in pursuing this with me?

Check out http://daviscoworking.blogspot.com (opening in early March at 213 E St., above Luigis Pizza)

Coworking is great! If you work from home, are selfemployed, spend hours on end in cafes working, or dont like the work environment at your real office and have the flexibility to be elsewhere, try it!
