About

Davis in a Day is a usergenerated documentary that will record what life is like in Davis on May 10, 2012. From students and faculty to community members, everyone in Davis will have the opportunity to tell their story. All it takes is filming 30 seconds to 5 minutes of your day on any videorecording device (smart phones, camcorders, cameras, computers, etc.) and submitting the video to AggieTV. After collecting all the film clips, AggieTV will then weave the most compelling ones together into a short film about Davis in a day.

Keep these things in mind:
 Make sure that you’re filming on May 10, 2012 (not any other day!).
 Have fun! Even the most ordinary of days are extraordinary.

History/Inspiration

Once upon a sunny March afternoon, AggieTV staff members were hard at work in the studio, debating what their next special project would be. After an exhausting brainstorm, the film Life in a Day caught everyone’s attention. And thus the Davis in a Day project was born. We are using a similar premise of filming 24 hours from different points of view, but plan on exploring different themes, filming styles, and guidelines. Although we greatly admire the work of Ridley Scott, National Geographic, and YouTube, we hope to create a film that is uniquely our story of Davis.
