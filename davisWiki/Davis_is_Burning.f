Davis is Burning is an annual drag show and competition hosted by Delta Lambda Phi, the fraternity for Rainbow Community Gay, Bisexual & Progressive Men. On its 24th year, the Brothers will be hosting Davis is Burning 2013 on Friday, November 1 at the UCD Freeborn Hall.  Check out the http://www.strikingly.com/davisisburning Official DiB Website or http://www.facebook.com/events/596070020435767 Facebook Event for the most uptodate information about the show!

The drag show initially began in 1990 as an event held in a DLP brothers home, but grew in size until it took over the 3rd & B Teen Center. Eventually, as the event grew, the locations moved to the Veterans Memorial Building Veterans Memorial Center, located on the corner of 14th Street 14th and B Street B, where it was held for many years. Finally, in 2008 Davis is Burning moved to Freeborn Hall on the UC Davis campus where it has been held ever since.

The program of Davis is Burning consists of acts (groups or solos) performing songs, dance numbers, runway struts, and comedic routines over the span of over two hours. Mixed in between the acts are the introduction and acknowledgments of the DLP brothers, the drag king and queen competition, comedic videos. In the past, the program consisted of the acts of everyone who applied, but because of the growth in popularity and attendance, the show is now limited to those who pass their auditionsi.e. not all acts will make it to the final show.

Davis is Burning is arguably the biggest and most respected drag performance in Northern CaliforniaIt also happens to be the only oneand is also a great way to get the most use out of your Halloween costume.

Grab something old, buy yourself a little something new, assume that somethings borrowed, and hold your breath til youre blue, ladies and gents! Because, though there may be an aisle and a bouquet, forget the bride ... THE DIVAS ARE COMING!

For their annual dragtastic event, the progressive brothers of Delta Lambda Phi cordially invite you to a celebration bound to exceed every girls fantasy wedding. Thats right, miss honey, WE SAID A WEDDING. Done only OUR way, of course: Fiercely.

Come join the divas as they stomp down aisle — uhm, we mean runway — and work it out in their hottest bridal getups. Professional drag artists from the Sacramento area, other campus organizations and dance groups, and of course your DLP divas truly, will light up the stage, in sheer celebration of the recent advancements toward marriage equality.

Its a night of genderbending fun for all of us, so we encourage your best drag ensembles, and in exchange, well crown the Drag King and Queen of the night, based on all your hoots and hollers! Its a night worthy of not a princess ... A DRAG QUEEN, MISS THING! So get ready for THE drag show on campus. Because tonights about celebrating the freedom to get hitched — to any king or any queen your heart has eyes for.
