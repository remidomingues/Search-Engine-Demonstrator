UPDATE: Davis The bunny departed the world back in June and he will be sorely missed. Sure, he chewed on everything, but he made Users/DeannaBrusco happy and could cheer her up as if he knew she was sad. So, let us remember little Davis the Bunny: he made the world a better place by making my friend happy. Users/MattJojola





Davis the bunny was originally named Mavis becasue his owner, Users/DeannaBrusco thought he was a female. Later, when he started humping everything in sight, she realized he was a male. She named him Davis because it rhymed and she didnt want to give him a complex.

Davis loves to chew on all of Deannas clothes, her cords, and recently chewed up her comforter. He likes to eat pizza, cheeseits, and carrots.
