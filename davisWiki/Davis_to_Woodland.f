## use this page with the {{{include()}}} macro

##question: Was this intended to cover the bike transit routes in the NorthSouth corridors, the bus routes, the car routes, etc?  OR whats inbetween the towns, like the turkey farm and the different upicks, and also Plainfield Station?
##This is an include for entries whose topic is represented on both the DavisWiki and WoodlandWiki.  I dont know how much it was used.
