http://www.davisfest.com/ Davisfest was a festival held downtown Sunday, October 15, 2006 from noon to 5 pm. It was put on by the Davis Downtown Business Association. There have been changes at Davis Downtown Business Association DDBA and no 2007 edition of this event is planned.



20070827 17:51:07 nbsp I rather enjoyed davisfest 06. But there was an imbalance between the number of places to taste beer or wine and the number of places to taste food. This resulted in dozens and dozens of people wandering around downton Davis in varying stages of drunkeness  standard for some evenings, but unusual on a Sunday afternoon. Users/DougWalter
