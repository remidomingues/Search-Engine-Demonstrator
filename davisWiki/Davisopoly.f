At some point, the Davis Rotary Club commissioned a version of Monopoly with a Davis theme.  Each property is a local Davis business, and was sponsored by these companies.  The money has Woodland Real Estate printed on it. It features some really neat Davis specific things, like the title being cow print, and the Go to Court spot using a Toad Tunnel to move you across the board.

A copy is among the games available at Java California, whose owner created the game.  The game was a fundraiser for a local hospital and raised $20,000 for a vehicle.
