Davisville â€™68: The History and Heritage of the City of Davis by Joann Leach Larkey was the first major published book about the history of the City of Davis.  It was published by the City of Davis in 1969 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of Davisville, the original name for Davis.  A second printing was done in 1980.  The book covers the history of Davis and surroundings from prehistoric times to just before the original publication, and also describes some of the early pioneering families to the area.  Several copies are available for checkout at the Davis Public Library.
