20100729 03:33:19 nbsp Please read the page about identity here on the wiki. Given that you are talking about working with youth and use the wording City of Davis on your non cityofdavis.org based website I think it is extra important that your edits be made using your real name. If Ive got to go through the process of getting a livescan to volunteer I dont think it is asking too much of you to have the courtesy to edit using your real name. Users/JasonAller

20100729 11:34:18 nbsp Let me be more clear, you are welcome to be an editor, but not with this username. Ill revert out your edits because I see this as a case of Wiki Community/Organizational Accounts/Abuse. Users/JasonAller
