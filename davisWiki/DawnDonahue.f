Hey Dawn, and welcome to the wiki!  My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  You had asked why I had edited your page... and the answer is simple: to improve the page, which belongs to (and is edited by) everybody. This site a resource documenting all of Davis, written and maintained by the community as a whole.  Its actually a nonprofit, so commercial promotion isnt allowed, although since it documents all of Davis  and Bohème is part of Davis  the topic of Bohème is certainly appropriate.  You might want to read Welcome to the wiki/business owner the community written introduction for business owners, as it might help give you a starting point.  Once again, welcome to the wiki, and congratulations on your new business!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845

20130911 22:25:58 nbsp Hi Dawn, when you http://daviswiki.org/Clothing_Stores?actiondiff&version2125&version1124 cross out and/or http://daviswiki.org/Clothing_Stores?actiondiff&version2129&version1128 delete links as a business owner, it tends to look suspicious. I understand now that you were trying to remove departed businesses (though Aellas page does not say it is departed), but it is best to preserve history instead of deleting it. Additionally, adding a comment when you make an edit (e.g. explaining why you are crossing out businesses) will make your intentions clearer. Welcome to the Wiki and dont be afraid to ask for help!
