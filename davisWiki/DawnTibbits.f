Howdy Dawn, and welcome to the Wiki.  Where in Florida are you from?  Im from Palm Beach County myself.  Users/JabberWokky jw


Thanks!

I grew up in Ocala, which is in the dead center of the peninsula.  I lived in Orlando for a few years...was born in Ft. Lauderdale....  Basically, I spent the first 14 years of my life in FL.  Never experienced a hurricane though...

Been in Davis long??
