Devoda Gardens CSA is now part of Mariposa Valley Farm

Inspired by the success of urban farm projects throughout the country, DeVoDa Gardens CSA was formed in the Spring of 2009 by 3 local women who wanted to create a truly local source of fresh, naturally grown produce for the communities of Yolo County, California.  One of several examples of Community Supported Agriculture in the area, they began transforming residential yards into beautiful, productive vegetable Gardening gardens & distributing the harvest to their CSA members.  Now in their second year, they have a network of gardens throughout the Woodland & Davis communities that supply garden hosts & CSA members with a variety of fresh produce.

Subscribers can sign up to have seasonal produce delivered every other week ($54/month) or every week ($88/month), or can opt for a onetime delivery ($30).  Details are available on their website.
