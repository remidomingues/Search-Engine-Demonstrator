DeVons had very friendly employees even though the business was very technophobic and would never build their own wiki page. They sold Jewelry jewelry.

Shortly before the closing, Diamond Consultant Frank Acosta left to open his own store, 3rd Street Jeweler located at 903 3rd Street.

DeVons closed at the end of February 2007. Habit Burger took over their spot.
