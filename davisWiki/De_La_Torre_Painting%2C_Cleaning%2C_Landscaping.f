20081003 19:59:19 nbsp Marcelo was a great find!  He is professional and courteous, hard working and a major perfectionist when it comes to landscaping.  On top of that, Marcelo’s prices are very reasonable.  He has helped us remove unwanted trees and stumps, cleared our “fixer upper” backyard, installed a sprinkler system and hauled 15 yards of playground bark.  Next he’ll install sod for both front and back yards!  He also does various handyman repairs (fixing fences, building gates, painting etc.).  We plan to have him help us with many projects around our house in the future and highly recommend De La Torre for reasonably priced landscaping and home repair in Davis.   :)

20090405 10:50:07 nbsp We also had a very pleasant experience with Marcelo Lopez.  He came to our home highly recommended by a master landscaper.  Marcelo repaved our patio and poured a weaving concrete walkway in two different directions from the patio.  We are thrilled with the outcome and all our friends have commented on how wonderful it looks.  Marcelo approached the project with considerable deliberation and planning.  He made suggestions that ultimately proved invaluable.  Once the concrete is poured, it is much harder to retroengineer other projects such as irrigation.  This was not a problem as he worked with us to ensure that we would be pleased with the end product.

Marcelo takes great pride in his work.  As another post indicated, he is very reasonably priced.  But more important to both him and us is that he takes ownership of the project and is dedicated to doing the job to our satisfaction.  You cannot ask for more than that.  We highly recommend him – you will not be sorry!

20090616 13:37:18 nbsp Our family also appreciated Marcelos work.  He came highly recommended.  He fixed our fences, installed a drip and sprinkler system, and did other major yardwork.  He always had great solutions.  He was conscientious, easy to contact, and nice to work with. Users/2umma

20091105 21:28:27 nbsp I needed some landscape work done and hired Marcelo  based on the previous wiki reviews.  Im glad I did.  Marcelo and his crew (David etc) are nice, honest people, and they did a great job for us.  Also, as stated in other reviews, his prices are very reasonable; but more important he takes pride and ownership in everything he does.  We hired him originally to put in a lawn and sprinkler system, but we were so happy with this work that we had him (and his team) lay concrete and bricks, put up some fencing, and even do some interior painting. We will certainly be using him for future work.  Thanks to the previous wiki contributors for steering him our way! Users/JonFenske

20140516 10:48:04 nbsp This company is no longer in business, and from the dates of the comments, seems like it has been out of business for several years.  Users/DannyMilks
