Dead Drops are USB flash drives stuck in walls in public places. Use them to share files anonymously! A fun way to play secret agent, or perhaps share files without invoking the wrath of Student Judicial Affairs SJA or the http://mafiaa.org/ MAFIAA. You can read the manifesto for the movement http://deaddrops.com/deaddrops/manifesto/ online or by going to a dead drop and copying readme.txt.

If youre going to use a dead drop, a USB cable is probably a good idea. Supporting your laptop with your hands while it is plugged into the wall isnt the easiest thing in the world. Also, plugging strange devices into your computer isnt the safest thing in the world. The standard precautions against viruses are recommended.
