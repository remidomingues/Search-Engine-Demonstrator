A stripped down fast version of the Dash, this is all about speed and gumption. Inspired by the events of 3D4, this is a criteriumesque race by moonlight.

DDD2
The second Deadly Davis Dash, subtitled Race and Pillage, was held on September 16th, 2006.  More than 40 racers made their way through six checkpoints to two frosty kegs at the Delta of Venus.  The route was given in pieces to the riders as they arrived at the various checkpoints, which included the tops of two campus parking garages and some really outoftheway neighborhood parks.  Those who raced in costume had one less checkpoint, and were eligible for the Best Costume award.\

The first Deadly Davis Dash was held on July 8th, 2006.  Approximately 45 racers left Central Park at about 7 pm to seek out the five checkpoints around town.  At each checkpoint the riders had to complete various challenges such as climbing through a jungle gym, drinking a shot of whiskey, or singing a rendition of Im a little tea pot.  The race ended at Delta of Venus with a keg of Pabst waiting for the tired and thirsty riders.

20090324 21:20:12 nbsp What is the Davis Bike Collective? What is the Somali Coast Guard? Are these real organizations? Is the Davis Bike Club somehow involved? This is confusing. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090324 21:43:35 nbsp The Davis Bike Church is changing its name, still DBC, just now that stands for Davis Bike Collective. The Somali coastguard are as real as the Somali Pirates and more real than the Somali fisheries which are gone for years now or the Somali government! Another kiss from the global North to the global South. The Bike race event is real, even if one of the sponsors is never going to hear of this event. Users/PxlAted
