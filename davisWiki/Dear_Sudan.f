Dear Sudan, Love Davis and Woodland is a local organization that is working to promote awareness of the genocide in Darfur, put pressure on politicians both Local Representatives locally and nationally to engage in action to improve the situation, and to raise money to send to Darfur and help with the crisis. The movement started in Petaluma, as an interfaith effort to help the Sudanese refugees. Other communities, including the Davis group, have joined the movement, trying to raise enough money to feed as many people as there are in their community; in this case, the Davis group is trying to raise $17,500, as it costs 16 cents per day to feed a person in the Darfur region.

The last time their website was updated appears to be July 22, 2010.
