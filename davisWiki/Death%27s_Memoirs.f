Deaths Memoirs is a short compilation of poetry and prose written by Constante P. Firme, an Undergraduate Students undergraduate student here at UCD. His work personifies Death as a character, and allows the reader to see his/her perspective in a sometimes humorous way. 

He recently gave a presentation at The Avid Reader as a visiting author and donated a percentage of his profits from book sales to CalPIRG CalPIRGs Hunger Cleanup. The book is still available at the Avid Reader  a fairly compact paperback. 

(Is there a page for Davis authors?? Books written by Davis residents/students? Let me know and I will integrate it.) 
  Published Authors?  Not quite specific enough.  Maybe just link them..
