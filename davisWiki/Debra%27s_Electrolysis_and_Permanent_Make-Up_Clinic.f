  Yes. My wife goes to her every week and says she accepts both debit and credit. Users/condemned2bfree

20090522 14:47:04 nbsp I go here regularly for electrolysis, so far the results have been great. It helps that Deborah is such a sweet person and easy to talk to, this makes the electrolysis process seem much less painful. Users/Zeeba

I definitely recommend Deborah for a Brazilian wax!  It was my first time when I had my wax done by her, and she just made it soooooo comfortable and easy.  She used hard wax that did not need waxing strips.  Once it hardened, she peeled it off without pulling the skin.  It only stuck to the hair!!  Deborah also explained the process really well, and she was a very interesting person to talk to.  I feel bad that I havent returned since my first and last visit, because... well.. its kinda expensive for me about $70 for a full monty (WELL WORTH IT, I GUARANTEE!!!).  It depends on the volume of hair you want to get rid of.  :)  I shall see her again soon!   Users/JAILEDAN
