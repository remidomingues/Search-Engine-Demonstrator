Well liquor is the default alcohol liquor used to make a drink.  So if you ask for a vodkacranberry (aka capecodder) without specifying what kind of vodka, youll get their well alcohol.  A bar that uses decent well liquor uses only name brand alcohol.  For example, Bartons is not considered a name brand, while Bombay Sapphire is.
