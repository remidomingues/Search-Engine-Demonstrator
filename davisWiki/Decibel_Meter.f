A decibel meter is useful for measuring noise levels.

Im wondering if anyone in Davis has one that I might be able to borrow for a short time.  I need to take some noise readings on something.  Users/IDoNotExist
 But you dont exists, so how can you borrow one? Perhaps Radioshack  Users/StevenDaubert

Buying one is way too expensive for what I need it for.  This is really just a one time use.  Borrowing one without existing is all part of the challenge.  :)  Users/IDoNotExist

What do you need this for? Which weightings, if any, do you need? How accurate do you need it to be? I dont have access to a lab grade meter, but Im confident I could throw something together using one of my reference microphones. Users/WilliamLewis

I bet its an attempt to see if something makes more than 39 db 40 feet away or whatever it is that quantifies an noise violation  Users/StevenDaubert

Nope! Users/IDoNotExist

Then you just maybe supremely bored <3  Users/StevenDaubert

Nope! I have a really good use for it...  Users/IDoNotExist
