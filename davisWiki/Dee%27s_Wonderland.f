The afterschool program helps each student learn MandarinChinese at each individual students pace in a fun and stressfree environment. The school aims to have the students utilize the language in every aspect of their daily life. The school immerses students into a MandarinChinese environment, where no English is spoken. Instead of passively learning through studying and rote memorizing, the school tries to create a fun learning environment through interactions and activities. Some of these activities include calligraphy, Chinese Chess, arts and crafts, poems, and songs. All of these activities also include teaching Chinese culture.



20120308 15:58:35 nbsp I have two kids currently at Dees.  Both started when they were two years of age, and my oldest is heading off to K pretty soon.  Mandarin immersion was an important consideration to us, but in all honesty... even if that wasnt a consideration, wed probably still have our kids at Dees.  Its just a very friendly environment, and provides everything were looking for in preschool education.  I tend to judge schools by the kids attending them, and just about every child at this school seems polite, wellbehaved, happy, and just generally welladjusted.  I hear shes a victim of her own success however... there may be a very long wait list for new kids.  So, if youre interested, get your kids on the waitlist eaaaarrrrly. Users/ChonT
