A seed is an article which is Seed Pages List clearly too short, but not so short as to be useless. In general, it must be long enough to at least define the articles title, which generally means 3 to 10 short sentences. Note that a longer article may be a seed if the topic is complex enough; conversely, a short article on a topic which has a very narrow scope may not be a seed.

Another way to define a seed is an article so incomplete that an editor who knows little or nothing about the topic could improve its content after a superficial internet search or a few minutes in a reference library. An article that can be improved by only a rather knowledgeable editor, or after significant research, may not be a seed.

Sizable articles which lack wikification or copy editing are generally not considered seeds. Note that small articles with little information may end up being nominated for deletion or be merged into another relevant article.

Once a seed has been properly expanded and becomes an article rather than just a seed, you should remove the seed tag from it. When writers begin a new article, they use the word seed to mean that it is still very short and that people can add a lot more useful information. Most seeds are only one paragraph or sometimes they are only a few lines. Seeds do not contain a complete description of a subject.

If you make or find a seed, add this special text to ask other users to make the article longer. The easy way to do this is to use the shortcut: {{{Include(Seed)}}}

20051205 11:26:13 nbsp The Wikipedia importance of identifying articles as stubs has to do with its goal of authoritativeness.  Weve had quite a bit of debate on the subject as it applies to Davis wiki.  However, I think a LIST of stub pages for people to work on would be far more useful than a tag on stub pages which is perhaps a visual eyesore.  Also given dual nature of the wiki as a forum as well as an information source, it perhaps is not appropriate to say that a page is useless OR _too_ short.  However, i agree that it would be good to maintain a develop this page, much like the wanted pages.  In short:  stub tagseyesore, not necessarily consistant with daviswiki model, but useful as a list. Users/JaimeRaba

20070220 18:32:01 nbsp Stub vs Seed... Stub is a wikipediaish title, JamieRabas comment above has stuck with me for a few days, and perhaps seed is a more encouraging title and placeholder definition for shorter items. Users/HimySyed

20070417 21:37:32 nbsp I like the new seed tag! It has a much more positive connotation than stub and the seedling picture is adorable. Win. Users/NumiaCairaguas

20071114 18:13:34 nbsp I think a lot of things that get the {seed} tag thrown on them are so short as to be useless.  Theres a difference between an article of some sort versus a blank page bearing only a name and location, which is seen on a lot of business seed pages. I suggest that those all get the {seed} tag replaced with the Apathy include, because its clear that no real effort was made towards establishing a usable page. <.< Users/EdWins
  It takes me about five minutes with Google to flesh out the empty ones, or ten minutes if I find lots of info and can get the entry to a good size.  If there was a page of businesses in Davis without entries rather than headers and a seed macro, I (and other people) could go through them easier.  The people who create the empty entries mean well, I know... but if you dont have the few minutes to put into them, just make a note for those who do (or come back later, or do fewer in a sitting).  Or just create a link to the non existent page somewhere so it show up on Wanted Pages, which is where many gnomes work from.  Users/JabberWokky
   (This reply is a seed.  Ill finish it later.)  Users/CarlMcCabe

20121129 15:23:51 nbsp  The three times Ive visited the store, Ive been treated well and all questions quickly and expertly answered. A fine fellow named Justin had all the answers to things that had completely mystified me.  This is a great store and a credit to Davis. Users/WillGuy
