For a Night Time latenight quick snack, there are four possibilities in Davis: InNOut (not so late, others arent mentioned), Jack in the Box, McDonalds and, of course, Del Taco. Del Taco is a chain that originated in Barstow, Calif., a city mostly notable for being on the way to Las Vegas.  Del Taco, McDonalds and Jack in the Box are the only true 24 hour drivethrus in Davis, although it seems that the food at Del Taco isnt quite as good at night as during the day.  This is perhaps due to the employees having to deal with so many Potheads high and drunk people.

Del Taco may win for one reason: they have a Cherry Coke fountain.

They also have a special Taco Nite on Tuesdays from 311p.m. where you can get 3 tacos for $1.09. Del Taco features a hot sauce called Del Scorcho: Image(deltacodelscorcho.jpg, 400, right, thumbnail, noborder)

Some comments on Del Scorcho:

...NOT. Some folks may call this hot, but I think those familiar with Mexican food would only call this mild. YMMV. Users/SteveDavison

As someone who is a collector of hot sauces and a Southern California native, I have to say that Del Scorcho is an interesting hybrid of sauces.  It is not the kind that burns the crap out of your mouth.  But it does have both a pique and an intriguing flavor.  It is not beyond hot in an absolute sense, but it is when compared to other fast food sauces.  There are many other hot sauces I prefer, but I think Del Tacos is good enough to deserve this tribute page.  And just as a side note, Mexican Food specificallyin its most authentic senseis not particularly renowned for extremely hot sauces.  Texmex and Cajun seem to take the idea of hot sauce to the next level, but I personally like my hot sauce to have some perceptable flavor and not lead to the shortening of lifespans.

Compare it to another packeted hot sauce in town: Taco Bell Border Sauce.

For the first time in 20 years, Del Taco is changing their logo. Their old logo will be eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2012. The new logo will be added to all stores. The slogan of Go Bold or Go Home has been changed to Bolder Fresher Better.


Users/JaimeRaba jr: The best things on the menu are chicken soft tacos, spicy jack chicken quesadilla.  The healthiest thing on the menu is a bean and cheese Burritos burrito (which comes in two sizes, the larger of which is 99 cents). If you accumulate enough Del Scorcho salsa packets, you can pour it into a bucket and use it for budget chips and salsa.

 I went there to try their Tuesday Taco Nite 3/99 cent tacos (normally $.59 each) (Tuesdays 311PM). They consist of (in order) a hard corn taco shell, seasoned ground beef with mystery filler (cereal or such), shredded iceberg lettuce, and grated yellow cheese. Despite their small size they were certainly tasty and surprisingly filling. I believe this to be due to the high fat (saturated) content of the meat. I then tried one of their bean burritos (since Users/JaimeRaba jr recommended it). It was probably the smallest burrito Ive ever seen, beating even Taco Bell. Considering that the origin of the word burrito implied a meal the size of a small burro (donkey), this is ironic. It was tasty though. Users/SteveDavison

 In my experience, the 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito is the best value (at 99 cents). I have tried the spicy jack quesadilla multiple times and the tortilla consistently tastes like matzah, i.e. way crispy. Bizarre.  Users/GregSmith

 When I went there, I got the macho burrito, and it was bad. The meat was on one side and the vegetables were on the other. I tried to draw a text art diagram, but it doesnt work here. Anyway, Im not going there again. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 Hmmm, it seems I went here again. This time I had 3 steak tacos (1 carne asada, 2 carbon) and a churro, and it was all really excellent. I dont know if the burritos have gotten better though. The tuesday night thing is great too.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

In my opinion, this is one of the slowest drivethrus in Davis.  Not because the line is long, mind you.  Ive waited in line for up to 30 minutes here before. Users/LeightonHinkley The El

Even though it was acquired by Pepsi (which also owns Taco Bell), Del Taco has always been a Southern California and Central Valley fast food chain.  Until the last few years, the Davis and Modesto Del Tacos were the closest ones to the Bay Area (especially since the San Jose store closed 8 years ago).  But since that time, theyve begun a few inroads, namely one in Pittsburg and San Leandro.  Last year, they finally opened a small one on Market and 7th in SF. Steve Stilson (stilsons@comcast.net)

When Pepsi bought Del Taco, there was an attempt to merge the menus of Taco Bell and Del Taco, resulting in Taco Bells first quesadilla offering.  But, just like the attempt to bring down Taco Bells menu prices, the menu merge attempt failed.  This is a good thing, since Del Tacos burritos are still better, I believe.  Del Taco also has more drink selections.

  Is that what happened?  I remember when Taco Bell tried to offer fries.  Everyone was asking if they were trying to be Del Taco. Users/RogerClark

I am almost positive Pepsi does not own Del Taco.  PepsiCo also does not own Taco Bell, although it used to.  Del Taco merged with Naugles (which mostly disappeared) in 1988.  And Taco Bell is now owned by Yum! Brands, Inc, which PepsiCo sold (some of?) its restaurant holdings to. Interestingly, the Del Taco founder was a coventurer with the Taco Bell founder with his first restaurant experiment, according to the book, Fast Food Nation. Users/JaimeRaba
  Yum! also has Pizza Hut, KFC and a few other chains under its belt. Users/TarZxf

20060104 09:16:18 nbsp My experience with this place is very uneven  sometimes the food tastes fairly fresh, and other times, its pretty bad.  I am still trying to figure out what the allure of their fries is  theyre horrible. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060825 00:58:54 nbsp great quikie! And great price. Not for health nuts, but they have really good bean and cheese burros! The salsa is outta this world! It tastes home made! Users/GehLei

20070511 19:19:04 nbsp I love cheap tacos. And there is never anyone else at this place. Del Scorcho is great too. Users/William.Peacock

20071129 16:46:03 nbsp Cheap imitation of Taco Bell...with the added gimmick of fries. Weak.  Users/SuperGiblet

20071217 19:17:37 nbsp I worked at this dump for one month. One month was all I could take. My coworkers were mostly ok, but the boss is kind of a bitch. I will neither go there nor work there ever again. I wont even comment on the quality of their food preparation. Lets just say that theyve been cited by the county for moldy soft drink spigots in the past. AVOID! Users/thelonepiper555


20080721 22:22:44 nbsp The strawberry milkshakes here are awesome. Only Redrum might be better. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080723 22:21:54 nbsp The thing that really keeps me coming back is the fries.  Perfectly crisp and salty more often than other places... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090414 00:44:11 nbsp i really like this place. the chicken is the best and the service is fast enough. i love charlie! hes way too into the job but hes fun. (hes the cute guy with brown hair ;D) Users/CindyBaby

20090713 22:16:04 nbsp The picture below makes the building look creepy, but dont be scared. I like it. Users/patrick82

20100427 23:34:08 nbsp their jalapeno rings are pretty good. $1.99 + tax but id pay $1.50 for it Users/mrturner

20100523 18:18:29 nbsp They have served me cold fries three out of the past four times Ive been there. I should have learned the second time. Users/aggies1988650

20110115 18:38:07 nbsp The New del Inferno Hot sauce is really Hot its the best hot sauce in Fast Food by far. Users/davidwsmith

20110115 18:45:44 nbsp I dont know what these people are talking about. I went there the other day and maybe its under new management now but this place is awesome. The people during the day are the friendliest people ever. It beats the taco bell by a long shot. The last time i went through the drive thru it was fast there were no cars in front of me and they had my food in a flash. I basically ordered pulled up to the window payed and they handed me the food i ordered. I think this del taco is amazing and i recommend it to anyone thats looking for GOOD FAST food! Users/davidwsmith

20110223 20:28:38 nbsp If you combine all the deals they have, like 3 tacos for a buck on Tuesdays, or $0.49 value beanandcheese burrito, or some of those coupons that come in the mail like every two weeks, you can get a real cheap meal here. I got 3 tacos, small fries, and spicy jack quesadilla on Tuesday for under $4. Pretty damn good deal, and the food tastes decent enough.
The only gripe I have is that theres a mindboggling amount of sodium here, especially in their beans. A 1/2 lb beanandcheese burrito has about a days worth of sodium, and its about the same size as Taco Bells bean burrito, which has half the sodium. Users/TheShah

20110224 01:24:37 nbsp Apparently if you go in early in the morning before their breakfast menus is officially open, you can still get certain breakfast items such as the breakfast burrito because they prepare certain ingredients first before others. Users/ClarenceL

20110303 15:38:31 nbsp Whoever decided that crinklecut fries belong on a menu with tacos is a genius.  I love their food and their taco sauce.  The employees are typically friendly.  Del Tacos food is better than Taco Bells.   Users/LoriOrf

20110403 23:15:16 nbsp Went there late Sunday and ordered a Classic Taco and Bean & Cheese Burrito. Service very slow. Waited about 15 minutes.
Saw employee use his mouth to tear open a bag. My Burrito had a piece of bone or something. I bit down and thought Id
broken a tooth. Wont return.  Users/nowhereman

20110514 16:02:58 nbsp If you love waiting forever for your food, having to scream at the drive thru speaker to get people to hear you, never getting the right order, and having expired sour cream in your burritos then this is the place for you. Users/rachealgalante
 For one thing, Ive found the speaker to be extremely responsive or sensitive.  Its great that its doing its job as a prominent member of currently only two 24/7 fast food places. Sometimes the food is really good. Users/BruceHansen

20110515 22:56:09 nbsp Went through the drive thru, horrible experience. First, they wont split orders. I guess thats understandable. However, when i went to pay, i asked to break a twenty dollar bill and the girl gave me a lot of attitude and said she cant open the register until i pay. I noticed the register was already open, so i asked politely if she would mind bending that rule and breaking the twenty before i actually paid. She said no, rolled her eyes, and i felt for a moment like she wanted to kill me. A customer should never have to feel uncomfortable for making such a simple request. And to top it all off, she forgot something on the order, perhaps intentionally. If any managers read this comment, train your employees in customer service, it is severely lacking. The employee in question is african american, late teens/early 20s Users/Kafani

20111006 01:59:44 nbsp Dear god, AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!! This is quite possibly the most revolting, most disgusting, FOULEST, del taco establishment, in fact, any establishment I have ever had the displeasure of going to. Long story short, in one of my chicken soft tacos I found a bone (at least thats what I want to believe it was)so big I couldve stabbed the del taco employee with it. After waiting an absurd amount of time and having some incredibly rude Mexican woman bark at me Whats your order!? (is it me or are they all mexican and they are always so rude and difficult to deal with?), I get my food and the first bite I take after spending my $8, I almost pierce my tongue on this !@#$^@%^% dinosaur bone/cartilage in my taco. I literally spit the mouthful of food out, stunned and confused, I then throw the entire bag of untouched food out the window, not even wanting to complain or get my money back, thats how bad the experience was. Let it be known, I am not being dramatic nor am I a del taco hater, fact is, I made an account on daviswiki specifically and ONLY to divert people away from this absolute atrocity of a fast food joint. I was a huuuge del taco fan for a long time; now I am quite literally disgusted and ashamed they have my money. I will never go back here again, I advise you all, steer clear of this #!$%&#!@ dump!! Did I mention, they are unbelievably RUDE! Users/GoHome

20111115 17:07:01 nbsp Im SOOO HIGH RIGHT NOW and I know where im going to treat these munchies. REAL DEAL MEXICAN FOOD. ITS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN DAVIS!!! Bring on the Mexican fried potatoes Users/KCSlater

20120109 10:33:33 nbsp Del Taco may win for one reason:  they have a Cherry Coke fountain.  Thats gold. Users/DavidBarnum

20120326 14:24:48 nbsp I will never go again. The workers are very very rude and the food was messy and gross. By far the worst fast food place in Davis Users/JennaAmpol

20130111 18:32:10 nbsp DO NOT COME HERE. I drove through the drive through and sat for 5 mins before i drove closer, reversed, yelled at the box, before finally parking and walking inside. there were about 5 employees inside, talking in spanish about some family drama in one of their lives. There were 2 customers ahead of me that appeared to be waiting for a long time. I waiting close to the counter to watch my food being made. Firstly, NO ONE was wearing gloves.  One of the employees (young male) grabbed a sausage patty with his bare hands and then started on my burrito. Did i mention he did NOT wash his hands between orders? Disgusting. The next emplolyee took her sweet time making my burrito while continuing her story to the other employees. Her priority was something other than making my food. I finally got my order, went into my car and stared at my food. There was a long black hair in it. DO NOT COME HERE!!!! EVER!! Users/Vero

20140618 05:57:24 nbsp I loved Del Taco since I was a child  now I no longer live in the United States and still remember it fondly   My belief is if I knew which brand of dog food they used in their Del Beef Burrito I would be able to make it at home    Users/JeffScorpio
