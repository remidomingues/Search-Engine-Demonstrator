Chuys Taqueria is the familiar option for great Mexican food in Winters. However, if you like your tacos and burritos from inside a carniceria, look around the corner for El Pueblo Meat Market and Taqueria/Deli. The quality of the tacos here surpasses that of the Davis taquerias (only the West Davis branch of Chuys Taqueria Chuys is comparable), so its worth a trip.

Tacos are $1.25 and contain a generous portion of meat. Meats available are:

 Asada/Beef
 Pollo/Chicken
 Carnitas/Deep Fried Pork
 Adobada/Marinated Pork ( al pastor)
 Camaron/Shrimp
 Birria/Seasoned Beef
 Chorizo/Sausage
 Lengua/Beef Tongue
 Cachete/Beef Cheek (particularly juicy and delicious)
 Carne Molida/Ground Beef
 Tripas/Tripe

Salsas and tortilla chips (circular and not fresh fried, unfortunately) are complimentary. Horchata is a good way to rehydrate after biking out here. Menudo is served Saturday and Sunday.

As for the meat market, it is extensive and affordably priced. This would be a good place for the Mexican specialties that are harder to find in Davis, such as goat meat and Oaxacan string cheese.
