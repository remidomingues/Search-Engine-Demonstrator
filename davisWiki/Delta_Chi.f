Delta Chi is a social Fraternities fraternity that is quickly making a positive reputation on the UC Davis campus. Featuring a wide variety of majors, sports, interests, and hobbies within its membership, the fraternity offers something for everyone. As one of the most diverse and accessible fraternities at UCD, we strive to maintain a strong campus involvement that is well balanced with academic, philanthropic, athletic, and social activities. We actively recruit highly motivated gentlemen to help establish traditions for years to come.
