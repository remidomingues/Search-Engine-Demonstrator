In 1974, the Beta Pi chapter of TriDelta was established on the UC Davis campus at 227 First Street. The first sorority affiliated with the university, TriDelta helped encourage other national sororities to make UC Davis its home. Since then, the Beta Pi branch of TriDelta has maintained its status as one of the top womens sororites at UC Davis.  Focused on academics as well as social events and activities, many consider Tridelta a rewarding and enjoyable organization to be a part of. Please feel free to check out Beta Pis website: http://www.davistridelta.com/.

 Philanthropy 
Of Course, a big part of sorority life is being active in the community and making a difference for some deserving causes.  Every year, UC Davis Tridelta holds 3 philanthropy events to raise funds for various charities and participates in many community service projects throughout the year.  In the fall, Beta Pi holds Delta Desserts in which all proceeds go to the MakeAWish Foundation.  In the spring, TriDelts hold their annual softball tournament, Big Bats, at Playfields Park on Research Park Drive.  To enter your team into the tournament,  donate raffle prizes or supplies, or to make a financial contribution, see the Tridelta Beta Pi website above and go to the contact page. Proceeds go to St. Judes Childrens Cancer Research Hospital. New in 2008, Tridelta held its first annual Pancake Dinner (which is in the middle of the night). Hopefully, this event will happen every spring so keep your eyes open! All proceeds from the Pancake Dinner also go to St. Judes Childrens Cancer Research Hospital, so eat some pancakes and support a good cause!!
