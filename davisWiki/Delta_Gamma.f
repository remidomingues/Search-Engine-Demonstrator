Delta Gamma is a Sororities sorority conveniently located at 225 Russell Boulevard, right across the street from the gorgeous UCD campus! Our Delta Chi Chapter represents an incredible group of fun, friendly, ambitious, and intelligent women who work hard to better each other, our chapter, and the community.



Our Mission Statement:
Delta Gamma offers to women of all ages a rich heritage based on principles of personal integrity, personal responsibility and intellectual honesty. Its primary purpose is to foster high ideals of friendship, promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character.

Our Foundation
Delta Gammas motto is to Do Good. Since 1936, our philanthropic efforts have focused on Service for Sight, a mission to promote sight preservation and assistance to children and adults who are blind or visually impaired. Determined to make a difference, our members go out in the community and assist at events such as  Sacramento Goalball (a competitive sport played by blind or visually impaired individuals of all ages), aid visually impaired walkers and their seeing eye dogs in walks such as Mutt Strutt, set up and help run the Northern California Blind & Low Vision Olympics For Youth, and, of course, put on great Campus Events to raise awareness and support for our Foundation.
Our philanthropy events are always fun and involve the entire Greek & nongreek communities at UC Davis.  A few of our most anticipated and hugely popular events include Anchor Splash, Anchor Slam, Delta Gamburger, and Dunkin Dips. We also love to support other Greek philanthropies and Campus causes!

Delta Gammas are the Proudest Girls on Campus
You will rarely see a DG around campus without showing some sort of DG pride! We have great relations with the other Greek chapters, as well as the UC Davis community. The friendships you make through Delta Gamma will last a lifetime!
