Delta Lambda Phi is an international social fraternity for gay community gay, bisexual and progressive men. The fraternity has 30 chapters and 4 colonies across the nation with a chapter in Montreal, Canada. The three founding purposes are to develop dignified and purposeful social, service and recreational activities for progressive men, irrespective of sexual orientation; to lead in determining the rights and privileges of individuals in society; and to present a strong and positive image that respects the diversity of all individuals, irrespective of sexual orientation. The national fraternity was founded in 1986 and the Xi chapter at UC Davis was chartered April 1st, 1990.



Brothers of the Xi Chapter
There are currently 14 active brothers in DLPs Xi Chapter. Since the chapter is multicampus based, student status at UC Davis is not required for membership. While most of the brothers are UCD students, brothers come from several colleges in the DavisSacramento region including sac city college.

Regarded as a leader in the Sacramento Region for providing social and service activities for the LGBT community, and recognized for its civic participation and activism on issues of gender, equality, and education, the chapter finds strength through the individual contributions of each person.  Outside of the fraternity, brothers continue in the tradition of excellence with community leaders and academic scholars proudly counting themselves a brother of Delta Lambda Phi.

FAQ
Do I have to be a gay man to join?
Delta Lambda Phi is openly accepting of anyone regardless of sexuality, age, race, background and religion.

I’m not openly out but I’m interested, what should I do?
We understands the struggles of being in the closet and our fraternity serves as a family to support each other. We have helped many to learn more about their sexuality and given them support when they do decide to come out to their friends and family. Please don’t hesitate to talk to any of us on campus or through FB if you’re interested.
