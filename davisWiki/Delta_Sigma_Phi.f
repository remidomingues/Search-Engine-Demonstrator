DELTA SIGMA PHI, perhaps better known as Delta Sig, is the top social fraternities fraternity on campus with the largest social calendar, and some of the most active members at UC Davis.


Who we are at Davis:
With 55 active membersa number that includes student athleteswe are a diverse organization with an array of social interests, yet we continue to be the closest group of friends.  Sports, philanthropy, partying, school, and sorority relations are among the things we take serious.  After our move to a new house last fall, 2014 promises to be a huge year for us as we continue to expand and take in more carefully chosen members.  Cherished and respected for its cautious selection of new actives, Delta Sig is a name we are proud to bring up around Daviswhether its to that girl in lecture or when we are confusedly trying to get into some random frat party during welcome week.

Social:
Being the diverse fraternity we are, there could be any number of reasons for which we encourage you to check us out and rush Delta Sig.  If its to stay busy, meet new friends, and identify better with the lovely sororities of UC Davis, pledging Delta Sig is the social move for you.  The following are only a few of the events we are proud to put on and participate in:


•Weekly exchanges with all the social sororities (yearround)
•Quarterly cocktails (yearround)
•Danksgiving (fall)
•Booty Camp (winter)
•Tropical Thursdays (spring)
•Houseboats (spring)
•Vegas formals (spring)
