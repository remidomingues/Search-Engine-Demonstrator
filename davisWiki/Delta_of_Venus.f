 Menu 
The Delta is actually a hybrid restaurant and coffeehouse. Studiers and other people who just want to linger over a cup of coffee are welcome, but there is a big selection of hot and cold food if you want it, which varies by time of day and day of the week (be sure to know the schedule if you plan to come for something specific to avoid disappointment).

There are many vegetarian and vegan options. The most distinctive offering is the Caribbean menu, offered weekday evenings. Brunch is available seven day a week. See /Menu the menu for full details.

 History 
Delta of Venus was opened in January 1993 by Users/RuthFankushen Ruth Fankushen and Audrey Park. There was no espresso machine, just brewed coffee, wheat walnut bread, and live music on the tiny Willow Stage in one corner. Fifteen years later, it has become a Davis institution. There have been three changes of ownership in that time, but the overall vibe of the place has remained same, true to the original vision of Ruth and Audrey.

Ruth writes: We thought of how Delta can mean change and that Venus conjures images of love...we wanted to create a change toward a more loving time. We wanted everyone to feel comfortable at D.O.V. Delta of Venus was named not for the book (although the title was definitely taken into consideration)...we were inspired by the Saturn Cafe of Santa Cruz and other cafes in San Francisco and Seattle.

We did have live music then, and (current owner) Lee among others, played on the Willow Stage. In fact, I fell in love with my husband Roger when he sang and played a Leonard Cohen song on the guitar. We opened in January 1993. We had no espresso machine when we first opened. We served Sacramento Baking Companys wheat walnut bread. Hello to any original employees and customers! Thanks to Lee to continuing the dream and doing such a great job.

In 1996, Ruth and Audrey sold the Delta to Marek Reavis and Susie Kong, who installed the front patio and deck, and began the trend of painting each dining room a different color. Two years later, the Delta was sold to Greg Didio and Willis Jones, who expanded the popular weekend brunch to seven days a week. In 2001, while living in the basement of the Turtle House, Lee Walthall bought the Delta of Venus with a small business loan and has been the proprietor since. Lee expanded the live music and DJ dance scene, added daily happy hour, and brought in his longtime friend Chef Iwaca to cook the Deltas famous Caribbean cuisine.

At one point Adam Veal was a morning chef here.

The Downtown Phone 9 payphone of Venus was on the Delta patio until mid 2007 and rang frequently, but was almost always dead air.


Amazing Caribbean food is served WednesdayFriday 6pm10pm.  In my personal opinion, it is the best food in Davis...or...maybe ever! Dina

Word to the wise: the food at Delta is tasty, but certainly on the pricey side.  Expect to pay $1015 for the Caribbean dinner and $810 for breakfast.
   Im not sure that I agree with this.  I took myself and a friend out to breakfast there, got a breakfast burrito + coffee for myself and a bagel with pesto + an americano for her.  The total was almost exactly $10.  Maybe it depends on what you order, but my breakfast burrito was fantastic.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   Ive managed to get both expensive and inexpensive food at The Delta. It really does depend on what you get. I personally recommend the Potatoes et al for breakfast, or the bagel with the works. The first is $5, but the bagel with the works is only $3.50, delicious, and filling.  Users/SharonZimmerman

Awwww man all the food is organic and oh so filling  I am rarely able to finish a full order of most things.  The sandwich bread (from the Village Bakery) is so chewy that my jaw hurts after Im done from the workout.  Iwakas food is so original you cant even find anything like it in Davis.  I wouldnt ever want to work there, though  where would I go when I want to skip work and get a beer?  Oh, http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/?id7605 that article in the Aggie pretty much hit the nail on the head.  Thanks Lee for creating such a unique space.  AriesAries
   I dont think all of the food is organic. Its really good food, but i dont think Sysco does much organic. Users/Pxlated
          Very little of the food comes from sysco, canned tomatoes and artichoke hearts pretty much. Its mostly things like paper towels and cleaning products.  The produce is primarily organic and local, from produce express in Woodland. Users/danpedersen

I would have to recommend the Plum Baked Chicken. The plum sauce is very spicy on its own, but if you put all the sides into the cup of sauce and eat it that way, its fantastic and just right. I have always found the employees exceptionally friendly, its almost got a mi casa es su casa sort of feel to the place. The music is firstrate on Thursday nights, usually a double header of top local and sometimes notsolocal folk musicians. Fridays can also have a good band early in the night, with a DJ it out. The Mad Cow String Band, probably Daviss best known nonrock music band, was among the first in recent times to bring popularity and attendance this venue on Thursdays, now they play about once a month. There is nothing better to do on a Thursday than eating plum chicken and drinking a pint of Wolavers, sitting outside at the Delta V listening to Madcow just after sunset. Users/JustinRau

The cheese pesto sandwich is the best thing thats ever happened to me.  dont tell my boyfriend.  Users/EllenWoodall

After wanting to try this place for half a year, I finally ate some Carribean food here a week ago. I was tempted to ask them to make it spicy (as most of the time Im underwhelmed by the spiciness level), but I refrained from it and the food turned out perfectly. The PlumBaked chicken was very delicious, the amount they give you is pretty fair, and the small touches (fried banana) really enhance the dish. I thought the sauce was slightly too sweet, but other than that pitchperfect. My roomate Quoc had the spicy chicken (had a taste) which was also very good. My roomate Cameron and friend Liz both had the Breaded chicken, but were a bit envious of what Quoc and I got. We went on a Thursday and the atmosphere at Venus was great. Users/AlvinTsao

20050921 08:45:36 nbsp My partner and I went to the Delta for dinner a couple of evenings ago. I had the jerk chicken which was very good  just the right amount of spice. However, the chicken was, as I call it, cooked to death. My partner had Coconut Curry Chicken Stew that we both thought lacked in curry and coconut  rather too bland for our tastes.

20060219 15:41:46 nbsp Ive been to Delta of Venus once ... the entire reminds me of something beachy. Its like Im waiting to look outside and see the ocean instead of cars zooming by. I have to say I like the people working there, and the setup of the menu and whats offered and all of that. I do think the management is entirely too laid back, though. While they have fanfreakingtastic sandwiches, the fact that they only serve them at certain times is kinda B.S., as is the hours theyre open. The food was a bit underwhelming as well. SS

20060219 15:42:02 nbsp I mean, its good food, dont get me wrong, but for $8.50 I was expecting a bit more I got the Coconut Curry Chicken Stew. The texture of the stew itself tasted very homemade; like someone cooked up some Campbells Select Mexican Soup and added chicken to it. I do love their sandwiches, though; a lot. In my limited experience, I dont reccomend this place as a study place. It seems to attract the pseudointellectual Im going to talk about nothing important loudly enough so everyone in the place can hear me talk about nothing important types. I wont hesitate to return, I do like it, its just not my favorite. SS

20060306 19:32:14 nbsp Im a little pissed off about the recent price hike here.  It would have been justified had they not axed the potatoes and toast that came with most breakfast items.  Now the only item that I think is really a deal is the curry stew, which is quite good (and filling!) but always needs salt. Users/AviBirns

20070502 20:38:53 nbsp Wonderful laidback hippy atmosphere; nice music, even for an old fart professor. Breakfasts (veggie omelet is outstanding), sandwiches for lunch (the tofucurry sandwich sounded weird but was deliciously sweet and tangy) and dinner (Carribean food — we tried the jerk chicken and the plum baked chicken — we especially liked the latter). There are so many interesting things on the menu that its guaranteed well be back many times. Users/CovertProfessor

20070504 13:32:20 nbsp I went to Delta after an exhausting Saturday morning run and thus opted for the vegetarian omelette. Since I wanted some protein, I requested tofu (requires additional charge)...but that apparently replaced the eggs? Im not sure how it can still qualify as an omelette if there are no eggs. In any case, the breakfast was huge! 12 slices of wonderful toast with roasted potatoes. The omelette had curried tofu and a decent amount of veggies and they didnt skimp on the cheese! ) It was all so tasty and very substantial/filling. Breakfast cost me about $10 ( but its probably the best breakfast you can get in Davis (Who goes to IHOP anyway?!) VT Users/VivianTang86

20070611 12:52:24 nbsp Finally I have gone to this wonderful little place. It is kinda cliquey, but it the food, atmosphere, and staff seem pretty awesome. The brunch was delicious (Mexican scramble was very spicy, but not too spicy, it was amazingly just perfectly enjoyable), though the coffee was a bit off, it was still fair enough a cup though Mishkas is better in this minor regard. It seemed like a nice place to chill, study, and relax. It is a bit pricey, but it seemed worth it, much better than spending money elsewhere, the sammiches seemed a bit oily, a friend had one, eh, it just wasnt my thing. Users/DavidPoole

20070617 17:34:20 nbsp the mexican scramble and the sandwiches are all good here.  The portions can be on the smaller side, but they are still reasonably large.  The atmosphere is great, and i get a really good wireless conection here.  Way better than any other place in davis.  The only negative is the lack of free parking near by.  Warning: if there is no parking on the street, do not park in the Ho viet lot, or the quiki mart lot.  Both places will have your car towed within a minute of seeing it there (i learned the hard way, it was breakfast and ho viet wasnt even open). Users/MattHh

20070811 19:29:02 nbsp there isnt a better place to eat breakfast and play bones on a sunday morning Users/rusty

20070818 16:25:04 nbsp Good:  Outstanding breakfast!  Quite possibly the best in town.  Decent coffee but they need to keep an eye on the freshness.  Lee and all the staff are delightful and friendly.
Bad:  Im sorry, but the Caribbean Cuisine is not good.  Boiling something in allspice and cayenne pepper does not caribbean food make.
Ugly:  The smoking, and the snooty pseudohipsters doing the smoking.  There is not a lovelier place to catch a cup of joe and a bagel on a beautiful summer morning.  Then some jackoff lights up a cig 3 feet away. Users/BillyBudd

20070826 15:42:45 nbsp OMG, Iwacaa Plum Chicken is sooooooooo good.  They make a mean soy mocha, too! Users/ElisaWeller

20070908 13:54:24 nbsp  I had a latte there and it was a bit more like a cappuccino. If you have a latte there, make sure to ask for just a litte foam on the top. As a side note, they did not serve regular or decaf pot coffee while I was there, so be prepared to order a specialty drink for a little more. They servers are friendly, and the atmosphere is delightfully bohemian.  Users/AnnaF

20070912 00:35:35 nbsp Ive been here twice now. Once for brunch on Sunday, which was great. I had a very good cup of coffee and a mimosa, with great OJ, in a pint glass! I had a breakfast burrito, which was good, except for the fact that it was full of big hunks of onion (which I dont like) and Im pretty sure the list of ingredients didnt include onions. Maybe they were in the salsa, though. Anyway, Im used to extracting onions from things before I eat them, so no biggie. My friend had the scrambled eggs with pesto  that was great. I am picky about homefries, and I thought theirs were very good, soft in the middle and crispycharry on the outside with plenty of seasoning, but not overly salty. The toast was to die for. Really, I would go back and just order toast. 2 coffees, 1 mimosa and two breakfasts so large that neither of us could finish  $22+tip. That seemed very reasonable to me, but Im used to San Francisco prices. I loved the quiet, relaxed atmosphere on the patio and there were a few people smoking, but none close enough to bug me. The girl who took my order was friendly and the guy in the kitchen smiled.

The second time I went to work on my laptop for a few hours on an earlySeptember weekday afternoon. I find that I concentrate better when its kinda noisy and chaotic around me, and this was perfect for that. The music was loud and often the rastaguy in the kitchen was singing (better than I can, well just leave it at that) louder than the reggae that was blaring, and I could hear the conversations of people around me (phone and otherwise.) Perfect for me, but if you like a quiet  environment for working or studying, then this is probably not the place for you. I couldnt connect to the inhouse wireless network, but I got on the Aggie Inns network just fine. I ordered a mixed greens salad with blue cheese and artichoke hearts. It was very good, veggies were tasty, crisp, and fresh and came with plenty of (unexpected) very good bread. I also, at the recommendation of a previous poster, ordered the black iced tea, and it was delicious! Again, the service was very friendly. I like that you bus your own table  I always try to spend plenty of money at places with free wifi, but not having someone come around makes me feel even more comfortable about hanging out there for a long time.

I really like this place, but Im new to Davis, so I cant compare yet. Users/EvoDiva

20071004 20:57:34 nbsp History:  1993 approx to 1996 was run by a woman named Ruth. 1996 to 1997 was run by a man named Mark.  During that time the door was to the left of where it is now, but Tues and Thursday noon concerts were held by various local groups, Diana Patterson Sextet.  Essentially the same clientel of that era, and I agree a nice place to jaunt off campus for coffee and a bagel.  Lots of characters there always, on both sides of the counter.   Users/swanson
  Actually, it was Marek, not Mark. He had been Marketing Director at the Davis Food Coop. He sold ownership to two men (names escape me) and they ran it for several years until Lee W. bought it. I forgot about the door being to the left (and 90 degrees off) from the current location.  Users/DougWalter

20071013 14:51:42 nbsp Amazing cheese omelets, especially with both jack and cheddar. I eat there every morning, the eggs are far better than e.g. bakers square.

20080123 11:26:59 nbsp To clear up a few questions:

Delta of Venus was named not for the book (although the title was definitely taken into consideration). Instead, we (myself and my friend Audrey Park, cocreator) thought of how delta can mean change and that Venus conjures images of love. We wanted to create a change toward a more loving time. We wanted everyone to feel comfortable at D.O.V. We were inspired by the Saturn Cafe of Santa Cruz and other cafes in San Francisco and Seattle.

20080803 12:20:58 nbsp My family received absolutely appalling service when we came to Delta of Venus for breakfast 8/3/08. The service that was so bad that we do not intend to return to the Delta, despite having been weekly patron’s of it for over 7 years.
The young woman serving the front of the restaurant/cash register was rude and dismissive, obviously annoyed having to help us with our order. She got into an argument with my husband about our five year old son holding the front door open for a minute too long (she told us he, ”was old enough to know better” and suggested that we should keep better “control” of him!)
When our food was ready she slung it down on the table without a word. When we approached the counter to purchase additional items and coffee refills we had to call to her in the back of the restaurant multiple times before being served, despite the fact that we were the only two families present.
Things turned almost abusive from then on! When we asked for a togo coffee cup it was slammed down on the counter with the message that we, “better put the glass cup away before leaving.”
As we left she shouted (actually shouted!), “thank god they are finally leaving.” When asked what had angered her so much, she told us that we had “left the table a mess” and failed to “leave a tip despite having spent $50.” We were outraged! If any restaurant employee was undeserving of a tip, it was her! The “mess” on the table was one coffee cup, all of the other items had been cleared.
When we informed her that we would never be returning to the Delta again after such abuse, she shouted that we “were not welcome” to return. She made certain that we will not do so ever again. We have never had such appalling service at a restaurant. Users/SarahRees

  Im not one for complaining about employees that I may not like or have disagreements with because I understand most people depend on their job to live, but this employee obviously doesnt value her job at all if she treats customers like this.  From your side of the story, it sounds like you didnt do anything wrong to cause her to act this way.  Id recommend making a formal complaint with the manager and/or owner.  Im wondering if there is some history between your family and this employee cause it seems like you had bad service from the start. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080806 Last Sunday morning my family visited Delta for breakfast.  There was one hostess there who was completely hostile toward us for our entire visit.  We met another family for an early breakfast (8:30) and sat together indoors.  The hostess was rude to the point of rolling her eyes at us and told us to never come back again at the end of our meal.  When I asked for a togo cup, the hostess glared at me, ignored my thank you and then told me sharply to put my glass cup in the tray and not on the counter.  We were completely appalled and still as I write this, I cant believe that this woman has been hired to be the face of Delta of Venus that customers interact with.  When my husband asked her why she said to never return to Delta, she blew up about us not busing our table (which we did 100%) and not tipping.  To this, we say that tipping is for service, for which we received zero.  We ordered at the counter, we got our own silverware/napkins, we bused our own table...and we did it all with a really bitter hostess who made us feel totally unwelcome the entire time.  We did send a formal complaint to the owner and explained the entire ordeal.  While we dont want to penalize an otherwise great local restaurant by terminating our patronage there, it would be hard to return knowing that a paid employee thinks its ok to treat people like that (and who is allowed to keep her job).

20081026 15:04:48 nbsp Im not sure whether bad service is just a feature of Sunday brunch or what, but on a recent Sunday the service really upset me.  Ive worked in food service before and so I try not to be a difficult customer, but when I see a friend of a server stroll up and get his omelette while I havent gotten mine half an hour after ordering (and its not that crowded), I think that there is something wrong with the way management is communicating its priorities.  It was especially frustrating because after waiting for about 25 minutes I told them that I would have to go soon and there just didnt seem to be any sense of urgency.  It was my first time there so maybe there never is any sense of urgency, but I really wish I hadnt tipped. Users/bluebird

20090202 11:25:28 nbsp Usually I love to have breakfast at the delta, but I had breakfast at the delta about a week ago, and the potatoes were tough and chewy.

Users/Haruesays

20090301 12:34:53 nbsp My boyfriend and I went to Delta for brunch one rainy Sunday afternoon. It was a fairly long line, and we wanted to guarantee ourselves a table so he snagged one and sat and waited until I was done ordering. There was a group of 3 older people in front of us talking so loudly about how it is so rude to grab a table before ordering food, how it is customary to get a table after ordering, and they talked about this for 5 minutes at least. The one guy said or else a couple could just walk in behind you and grab a table even though they got there after you it was super awkward, especially because there were like 5 open tables that they could have grabbed, and they were still there after they ordered.

But really, isnt it right to want to know if you can get a table before you order, to know if it is a here or togo order? I dont want to be sitting outside in the rain. So... this isnt a rule, right? just curious. It made for a very uncomfortable, awkward time at the Delta.

PS, I really like this place their food is wonderful! Users/Lala

  I believe the theory is (and it doesnt always work this way) is that you are taking the table from someone whose food is ready to consume and that if everyone respects the process then there will also be a table once you are ready to eat so relax and wait your turn. It sounds fair. This is the same practice at Crepeville. The problem, of course, is that it doesnt always work out that way. Weve gone to Crepeville at times and ordered our food and looked around for a table and still hadnt found one by the time the food came out. We finally did find a table and it was outside and this was still cold and rainy season so we froze our butts off, not to mention the food was cold in about two minutes. If thats the policy at Delta, or any place, there should first be a sign recognizing it, and second some kind of discount returned should you find yourself without a table once the food arrives. Essentially, restaurants like that are making money above their capacity, but at a cost to their customers. That all being said, I love both Crepeville and Delta. The food is delicious, beverage choices excellent and service quite good (which is why I return). Users/condemned2bfree

20090426 21:14:36 nbsp I go to this place at least twice a week for oatmeal and coffee. Their oatmeal is the best! I like talking to the staff: Lee, Blake, Sharon, Autumn, Noe and Iwaca. Theyre very friendly.

20090612 14:29:17 nbsp Caters to the judgmental hippie crowd.  Dont get their chai, as it is usually watered down and expensive.  This place puts on local events and stuff.  5/10. Users/strawberry

20090815 23:58:21 nbsp In my opinion, pretentious, unfriendly, and over priced. The coffee is good, and they have a nice selection of beers. If you are into the coffee house art thing, this is the place for you. Users/Darren22

20091116 22:27:34 nbsp my two friends and i were carded by the cashier, which i didnt mind (its nice to look younger than i actually am ;D)
however, she was a total twat about it. she asked us our addresses, how long weve been living here, told us to stand up straight, and after we answered all her questions correctly, and nicely, she tried to refuse us service!!! didnt see her harassing anyone else. i guess they are on the lookout for a local gang of underaged alcoholics. either way, dont think were coming back. Users/ChelsAlex

20100307 04:14:16 nbsp Me and my girlfriends favorite place to get breakfast, it is definitely kinda pricey, but we both usually get the house special ($5), which is a pretty good deal.  Users/KtotheF

20100506 19:07:50 nbsp Cool hangout, but slightly overpriced drinks ($2 for a glass of iced tea?), and strangely theyre NOT one of the 150 businesses that accepts the Downtown Davis Gift Card. :( Users/jsogul

  To accept the Gift Card, a business must be able to take Mastercards as well. That may have something to do with it. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100508 14:47:22 nbsp I have been going to the Delta Venus for years and have always appreciated the food, atmosphere and service. On the morning of Saturday the 8th I went there for brunch and it was quite busy.  I ordered a baguette and some scrambled eggs and it didnt come out for 45 minutes.  I went in to ask the cashier how much longer it would take and she was extremely rude to me.  The same cashier has been snotty to me in the past but this time she was so disrespectful it soured the entire experience.  Before I left I went in and told her how I felt I was being treated and she ignored me and turned her back to me. Users/erindeacon

20100606 12:57:04 nbsp Definitely get the stuck up vibe people mention, but I still love this place for coffee, for food, and especially the atmosphere. I wish there were more places like this in our little college town.
My one gripe was yesterday, I wanted to come for lunch and stay a bit longer to study after. I walked in and looked around, not a single open table, inside or out. I understand it can be busy, but this was mid afternoon, past lunch time, and the majority of people either had nothing and few had coffee. Times like this I like the signs on certain tables for customers only. Im usually not one to complain, because I myself will go to places like this and study, but usually I order a drink or something, only common courtesy. I ended up heading to crepeville which had multiple tables open. Just disappointing, that I couldnt order lunch from them because there were no open tables and none looking to be opened in sight. Users/mperkel

20101010 17:42:09 nbsp I was pleasantly surprised to find it open today since the street out front was being torn up. I was even more surprised at how empty it was! No wait at all. The food was excellent and served fairly quickly. Ill have to come back and try some of their dinner dishes.  Users/BoogabaahWeesnaah

20101030 16:09:54 nbsp I love this place.  Its way over priced but its worth it every once and a while.  Also, a lot of people dont realize that, if you ask, you can tinker with the menu.   Users/elgreen

20110130 16:45:44 nbsp Wary of this place because Ive heard so many people say customers/waiters are snobbish. But so far I havent had a bad experience in my 2 times there. The ginger beer (nonalcoholic, think ginger rootbeer) is interesting, try it! Users/Tparkeressig

20110206 12:52:57 nbsp Never be wary of the Delta! It is the best watering hole in Davis. Fabulous food, superior selection of drinks, amazing atmosphere. Well worth every penny, and a tip. If you havent been, check it out. I recommend the breakfast burrito, and the baguette with pesto. Users/Alexa


20110505 12:52:57 nbsp Love this place!!  Very cool place to get a beer and chill, or drink some coffee and study.  Good ambiance, decent food.  Users/bobobb

20110505 18:03:11 nbsp Delta is eternal: the physical aspects change over the years, and the mix of patrons changes the vibe ever so slightly... but the general comfortable feel of a well worn and long loved institution remains. Users/JabberWokky

20110512 16:06:20 nbsp Does Delta still host a Go night on Wednesdays?  Or any other time? Users/TomGarberson

20110515 22:55:36 nbsp I love their food and the whole vibe of this place, but I do have to say that one of the cashiers/waitresses is VERY rude and seems to be in a bad mood all the time. I dont expect her to be friendly and in a great mood all the time (I go there maybe trice a week), but I also dont expect to be treated poorly every time I go there. Does anybody know what I am talking about? Shes the one with the bitter face... yeah, that one. Other than that, cool service and nice people. Users/JaySanchez

20110624 21:15:30 nbsp I went to the Irish jam session the other day. Fun times. Users/BarnabasTruman

20110708 23:31:58 nbsp Carribean food: hot and spicy chicken 5/5  this dish was excellent and the vegetables (especially the yellow yams) were tender and cooked to perfection.  Ive never had Carribean food but this was a really good firs impression. Also, the portion size was good. (not too much not too little)

sandwiches: Greek sandwich 4/5  the bread was chewy and the red onions were limp but everything else (olives, feta, lettuce) was good.  Just cant justify spending 6 dollars on such small portions. Users/rootmeansquare

20110822 07:22:50 nbsp I did not think this place could offer me anything that I would really crave but my gf convinced me to try it out. I got hooked on the bagel with over easy egg, pesto, and a side of potatoes. I have been for dinner twice, both times for the Red Snapper which has some great sides with it. The DJ that was there both of the times I went for dinner was great! Users/KurtG

20111223 12:40:03 nbsp I love the art that hangs all over the walls, but especially in the bathroom, and more specifically the toilet seat.  Some day Ill take a picture and post it on here.  The ginger beer (nonalcoholic) is like crack to many of my friends.  This is a great place to hang out.   Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20120421 21:34:50 nbsp Maybe this place had a cool vibe years ago, but now it feels dead. I dont know if its the one cashier with a hornets nest permanently stuck up her ass, or the cluster of faux hipsters chainsmoking on the patio... its just sad.

The food is good. The prices and the service are not.

The first time I ever visited in 2004 was also the first time I ever met the infamous Party King of Davis, Rob Roy  dancing naked on one of the tables. This is what this establishment became known for  crazy, cool stuff like this. It is not known for good service, reasonable prices or welcome atmosphere.  Users/Chronoz

20130224 15:27:17 nbsp I guess the website doesnt get updated, because I checked it before leaving Mishkas (too crowded!) and it said Saturdays and Sundays they are open until 6. Sad and annoyed to have to walk all the way over there to find them closing at 2.  Users/OhHey

20130507 12:49:48 nbsp I used to go there a lot more often when at UCD. Now a days I get to go occasionally, I still like atmosphere and the food. Breakfast is mostly what I get to go for and these guys are still doing a fantabulous job on food and service. I would highly recommend to anyone to give it a chance!   Users/RajwantSingh

20130524 14:37:35 nbsp The employees arent super friendly. Ive never been greeted as Ive walked in, and the cashiers never talk to you except to cooly ask you what you want. The place seems a little run down. super good bagels though Users/AnBan

20130623 10:30:25 nbsp This place is pretty awesome, has been for a while. Breakfast food could be better, but its good.  Ital food is amazing, try it.  I wish it was open more often as they often have good music and atmosphere.  Users/bunsey

20130916 20:22:04 nbsp OK, please somebody, enlighten me. We were here on Monday 992013 and today 9162013, in the evening. It was very clearly closed. Do we miss something? I thought they were open on Monday? The competition benefits. PS: lol: https://twitter.com/constantiaoomen/status/379811988869636096/photo/1 link Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131207 13:10:15 nbsp Im probably not adding much to what has already been said. This place is amazing. Great food for (vegetarian, breakfast, Caribbean dinner, etc.), great people (my social life in Davis basically began here), Lee is a great human being, great music, and probably a lot of other great things Im forgetting. Although theres a hippie scene there as others have mentioned, they also definitely cater to an international crowd, musical crowd, queer culture, families, and dogs. If youre looking for an undergrad, trashy, Vitos/KetMoRee vibe, dont come here. Users/ManojDoss

20140102 11:06:17 nbsp Since becoming a vegetarian, I find myself here a lot more often. Everything Ive tried is delicious. Users/ScottMeehleib
