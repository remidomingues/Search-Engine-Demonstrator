Democracy Matters is a small but active campus campus student organizations organization devoted to strengthening our politics democratic system.  They believe that there is a problem with money in politics that threatens the lifeblood of our country. They hold that our politicians are too dependent on special interests for money to run their campaigns, which makes them beholden to their funders when they are elected. Special interests (corporations and wealthy individuals) have an unfair advantage in our democracy.

They attempted to bring full public financing of elections to California by 2008, which they said was already proven to be effective in Arizona and Maine.  Alas, they didnt manage to do that.

Here are some great websites to explore the issue of clean money:

  http://www.fundrace.org  Look up a map of your neighborhood and see who donated, how much and for whom.
  http://www.opensecrets.org  Very organized and thorough! Shows which companies and interests have donated and to whom.
