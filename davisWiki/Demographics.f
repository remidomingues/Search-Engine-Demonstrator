There are roughly 74,000 people living in the Davis County Census Division of Davis. The population of the incorporated City of Davis is closer to 64,000. This figure is lower because it does not take into account those living on the UC Davis campus or in the Citys outskirts. 26,305 Undergraduate students and 33,307 total students attend UC Davis (2013). The average age is 25.2 years old, average income is $52,832, and median Property Values house value is http://www.realtytrac.com/ValueTrac/Landing.aspx#Davis,%20CA $448,036. To learn more about the issues and people dividing the Daviswiki along ethnic and racial lines, visit our Race & Ethnicity page. Davis is often perceived as a small town because it has no directly bordering towns and because a majority of the California population (60% in 2008) lives in larger towns. However, Davis is in fact large relative to California towns in general because it is well above the median population of towns (28,672). These calculations File(capopulationdistribution.xls) were made with http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e1/200809/documents/E1%202009%20Internet%20Version.xls data from the http://www.dof.ca.gov/ California Department of Finance.

In addition, in 2012 the U.S. Census Bureau determined that Davis was the 6th most densely populated urbanized area in the country, with 5147 people per square mile (http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/object/article?f/c/a/2012/03/27/MNG91NQI7S.DTL&object%2Fc%2Fpictures%2F2012%2F03%2F26%2Fbaurban0327_gr2_SFCG1332815926.jpg see graphic).

Note that the UC Davis population is almost certainly a part of Davis as well.  Compared it its neighbor city, Sacramento (http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,340694,00.html Americas Most Diverse City by TIME), Davis is not nearly as ethnically diverse. The UC Davis University clearly contributes a great deal to the Davis Citys ethnic diversity.

 Asian 

UC Davis has the fourthhighest Asian population among American universites, behind wiki:WikiPedia:UCLA UCLA, wiki:WikiPedia:UC_Berkeley UC Berkeley and wiki:WikiPedia:UC_Irvine UC Irvine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_american In the Sacramento and Yolo metropolitan areas, Asian Americans form about 9.0% of the total population (2000 census).

In the Fall Quarter of 2004 there were 8,733 Asian undergraduate students attending UC Davis, making up 38% of the total undergraduate population. Of this, the three largest sub groups were students who identified themselves as Chinese (3,872), Vietnamese (1,270), and Filipino (1,054).

Among grad students, 414 students identified as Asian, roughly 10% of the population.  Those who identify themselves as Chinese number 191 with Pakistani/Indians coming in second with 42.

Asian faculty members numbered 331 and made up 14% faculty on campus. Chinese faculty members were the most numerous Asian staff.

 Education and employment (over 25) 

Davis has a fairly typical education demographic for a college town.  Davis was ranked Americas second most educated city (after Chapel Hill) by USA Today in the 1980s, and holds the title of Californias most educated city.  A casual, incomplete survey shows this no longer to be true, Davis is behind at least two other small college towns (Chapel Hill and State College).

 Commentary 

Mixed Race and Multiethnic

Mixed Race is a term used by people who wish to acknowledge their mixed race heritage.  The term mixed race is used as opposed to biracial because people may be more than two races.  Biracial tends to imply that one parent is one race and the other parent is a different race and can be leading, but both parents could be of the same mixed heritage (such as both parents being White and Black, themselves biracial and thus their children are biracial).

Multiethnic is a term to acknowledge the mixed culture and history they have grown up with.  Anyone who has to identify as (African, Asian, Mexican, Brazilian, Indian, etc)American will have a multiethnic background because they are negotiating a mixed of cultures between their home/native/ancestorial culture and the U.S. culture.  Multiethnic can also be used by people who grow up as one race but identifies with another races culture (such as a White person who identifies with Hip Hop or Mexican culture).

First and foremost, race and ethnicity are social constructs.  There is no race gene that predermines ones race.  Race and ethnicity will vary in different locations and social arenas.  The definitions provided above

UC Davis Mixed Race Issues

Currently at UC Davis, students are allowed to check all of the races they identify with.  BUT when the university inputs this info into their system, the students race with least representation at the school is marked as their only race.

Example:  Users/JoAnnaRich is mixed and marked off the Pilipino, White/Caucasian, Native American boxes but on University records will be marked as Native American.
Other Examples:
  Black and White > Black
  Mexican and Black > Black
  Asian and Mexican > Mexican




I know a many people that grew up in Davis and I notice them having a lot of racist tendencies. Im from Sacramento which is, according to TIME magazine, the most ethnically diverse city in America. Davis wants people to think it is so progressive but it is really a lilywhite racist facade. When hate crime happens in this town I am not surprised. Evolution is best when ethnicities mingle. My main point is that without the university Davis would hardly be diverse. I would be even worse than what the statistics show because even less professors of ethnic backgrounds would live here. Davis may project the idea of them being the perfect progressive all American city but there is a reason why a picket fence and a Klansmans robe are the same color. Users/RobRoy

My Chinese friend was called Chink by two white men at a local gas station last week.  Davis isnt friendly to nonwhites.  It must be tough living in such a racist town for nonwhites.  So sad.  For such a small town, Davis sure does have a lot of hate crimes.  Again, so sad. Users/JohnTrombone

Can someone verify if the 65,000 figure includes UGs who live in dorms? The wording above is ambiguous.  Also, some information on the economic backgrounds of UCD students, average parental income and educational background might be interesting
  As a former censustaker, the 2000 census (at least) DID include the Undergraduates who lived in the dorms.  I know because I canvassed them. :) Users/PaulLanzi prl

Ask Caliph Assagai about having someone shout Get out of our town ner while walking around downtown.

The first set of demographics for UCD is wrong as it is not current (its from May 2004).  The second set was mentioned in the Aggie and was updated 1/2005.

I think individuals behavior shouldnt speak for the whole town.  Yes, a town is composed of individuals, but what I see posted here are isolated incidents, not mass hatred.  Each city has people who think that people unlike themselves are really different and should be treated as such, tolerance just means not letting them hold power over everyone else.  Users/AllisonEriksen

  I dont agree that the examples posted above are isolated incidents. In a town with a 65% white demographic, stepping up to say, Hey... this has happened to me a few times usually results in a fairly defensive posture and essentially a http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?file/chronicle/archive/2004/02/15/INGEM4VHE11.DTL brushoff. It usually doesnt seem worth the effort of defending oneself when pointing out instances of racism  it often seems easier to let people think what they want and just share the info among others who know what youre talking about. Ironically, it seems like those who wouldnt be considered racists not speaking about anybody in particular here! are the very same people who get most defensive when the issue is brought up.

Discussion moved from Kevin Wolf.BRBR
I saw Marty West on DCTV on election day evening. She chose to characterize the no on X voters as racist because we rejected this project and now Latinos wouldnt be able to buy a house in Davis. As if these people we see slaving in the fields out by Winters can purchase a $600,000.00 home.  Users/PaulThober
  About latinos slaving in the fields, I know there are lots of Latinos who own homes in Davis right now(this is California, what do you expect? Before Fremont invaded, most California homeowners by far were Latino.) Also, there are alot of field workers who save up money and buy houses in town. I know one guy bought a duplex in Woodland and rents out the half his family doesnt live in. So it is not even just cheap little places to live, but investment too. So dont have such low expectations for people. Users/NickSchmalenberger

  My point of Latinos not being able to afford $600.000.00 houses was based on the fact that the median income of Latinos in this country is far less than that of Davis residents, and only about 10% of Davis residents would have been able to afford to purchase one of these homes. If we want Davis to be more diverse, developements like Covell Village are not the way. We need to develop truly affordable housing.

  ...there are alot of field workers who save up money and buy houses in town. Oh, really?


  And before the Spanish invaded ...most California homeowners by far were... Native American. Users/PaulThober
   My point was that relatively low homeownership by Latinos in California is just a temporary feature of the current political and demographic situation, and your response supports that. Latinos are supposed to be a majority in California now and there are high level Latino politicians in California like Cruz Bustamante and Fabian Nunez. Maybe by 2030 or something the political situation will be similar to the 1830s. I dont think this would be any better or worse, but interesting. That is how I view diversity in general; not good, not bad, just interesting. I like to eat at ethnic restaurants, but if Davis didnt have any, I would just go to a city that did and make an adventure of it instead of trying to force Davis to be a certain way. Users/NickSchmalenberger

  20051115 21:50:46 nbsp There are pro and con arguments on either side here, although some may be using valid arguments as a stratagem for selfgain (e.g., Im Rush Limbaugh, and I support Latino voters . . . so long as they vote republican). I cant say just yet, based on the arguments presented here, who has the stronger case; but regardless, lets try to be civilI know its hard when moral values are concerned, but we must try to avoid character assassination and assertion over solid argumentation. And this was precisely the problem with the whole Measure X battle: too much rhetoric and not enough sound argument. Many people voted no simply because they were disenchantedthey saw that neither side was exercising the principles of critical thinking, while the yes side was going even further by trying to turn it into a marketing campaign.
