Denise, you may want to create a business page with the same name as for your website or with a different name that you have registered.  If you want to see the page which you created and someone deleted, you may put a search for Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, click on create a new page with this title then click on info, then view your version.

 Now I see that youve been participating in a new page, so take the first sentence above with a grain of salt (I hear that sea salt is better). Users/BruceHansen
