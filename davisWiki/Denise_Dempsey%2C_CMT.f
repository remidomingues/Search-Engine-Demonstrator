 Therapeutic, Relaxation Massage and Reiki 

Denise Dempsey, CMT, is offering therapeutic massage and Reiki at The Bo Tree Yoga Studio, 817 Fourth Street, downtown Davis. With an abundance of experience and skill, Denise specializes in both Reiki and massage for relaxation, rejuvenation and healing. Oriented towards relieving the pain and discomfort of muscle tension and old injuries, improving circulation, and reducing emotional and physical stress, massage helps the body detoxify by improving circulation and flushing the tissue of lactic acid and other metabolic waste. This can help shorten recovery time from muscular strain and injuries. It also can help improve lymphatic circulation leading to enhanced immunity and the bodys ability to detox from environmental pollution.

Reiki is a Japanese technique for addressing stress and relaxation that simultaneously promotes healing using vital energy, often called prana or chi in other systems.  Administered by the “laying on of hands, the Reiki practitioner facilitates restoration and clarity of its flow, promoting greater health and wellbeing on all levels. Denise Dempsey has been trained in classical Japanese Reiki to the degree of Reiki Master through the International House of Reiki.

 MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction Class 

This 8week course teaches mindfulness meditation and yoga that is designed to help improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of people experiencing the negative effects of chronic stress. Based on the 30 year old program created by Jon KabatZinn, Ph.D. (author of Full Catastrophe Living) at the UMass Medical School, it was also featured on the Bill Moyers’ PBS documentary, “Healing and the Mind.”

Mindfulness is the practice of cultivating nonjudgmental awareness in daytoday life.

Meditation can help you feel better, sleep better, increase your ability to cope with stressful situations, improve selfesteem and renew enthusiasm for life and work. One can feel more alive and joyful and gain immediate access to powerful inner resources for healing.

20100126 09:09:47 nbsp I took her MBSR (MindfulnessBased Stress Reduction)class and it was excellent.  This is something everyone should try.  It is not just about stress reduction, I found that it taught me how to be more in touch with my body and surroundings.  I was reluctant at first because I am rather sceptical about new age stuff, meditation and all that.  The techniques used in the class are based on good science, and the way Denise teaches the class allows you to take what you want from it, and apply your personal beliefs and feelings.  Highly recommended. Users/DagonJones
