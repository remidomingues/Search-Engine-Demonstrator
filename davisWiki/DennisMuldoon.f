I really just created this account so that I could edit all of the erroneous and incomplete information regarding Unitrans (wow, how much of a dork am I?) with whom I am gainfully employed as a bus driver and student mechanic. Yeah. Aside from being a busnerd, I play the trombone in the Aggie Banduh and am a proud Integrated studies IS alum. Yay nerds! Anyway, yeah. When not doing one of these nerdy things (or sometimes when I am), I can be found with the wonderful and lovely Users/katebaker Kate Baker.  Yay.


PS.  Graduation is for suckers.
