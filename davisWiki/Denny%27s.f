Dennys is the place to go if you want good portions of food, coffee fit for a trucker, or a place to go eat at 3 am that isnt more expensive than it should be (unlike Applebees).

Be sure to try their appetizer sampler, although its not the healthiest thing to eat on a regular basis.  They have the best American style nachos youll ever find, a huge plate of yellow corn chips loaded with everything bad for you.  The salads are iceberg and carrot shavings: good for the rest of the country, but not California with Dos Coyotes many Plutos better Davis Food CoOp options.  The Hamburgers burgers and chicken sandwiches are good solid fare, reliable but not exceptional.

The 24 hour availability of breakfast is a big draw.  From the heart attack on a plate of the Moons over My Hammy (try it with hash browns covered and smothered for a Cheney level of cardiac stability) to really good inexpensive deals on one and two egg slams, there is an always available fix for your morning food munchies.  Dont miss the single item menu  from fruit bowls to cereal to single eggs to grits, there are a la carte items for any specific yearning.

Dennys is rolling out free WiFi.  All east coast locations have it, and some locations in the Bay Area.

There used to be a Dennys in Davis which opened and closed numerous times before finally being shuttered  the space was then occupied by Abes Cafe & Grill. The West Sacramento location was originally an Eppies restaurant, sponsor of wiki:sacramento:Eppies_Great_Race, the worlds first (and still running) triathlon!



20060214 18:51:44 nbsp I wouldnt recommend the Dennys in Dixon, at least not on Sunday mornings.  The last three times Ive been there the service has been poor (and they werent all that busy).  Once we were completely forgotten about; had to corner a server to find out where our food was 30 minutes after ordering.  Last trip the food was served cold.  Next time were trying the IHOP.

20060218 05:03:12 nbsp I love iceberg lettuce. All alone except for some ranch and maybe a bit of cheese. Mmmm. By the way, Dennys has some kind of chicken breast with bacon on it thats quite good. I forget what its called. Huzzah for 5AM posting. Users/RoyWright

              There used to be a Dennys in Davis, but it had to shut down because it lost money when it started its no studying policy.

20070701 13:16:36 nbsp I believe the Dennys in West Sacramento has always been a Dennys, never Eppies. The Eppies is still across the freeway on West Cap. Users/ssmith

20070712 16:39:17 nbsp I love the west sac Dennys and Dot, a waitress there, is incredibly sweet. Users/RohiniJasavala

20080327 16:26:36 nbsp I do not recommend going to the Dennys in Woodland(the one near the 5). Ive been there twice and both times Ive had to wait nearly an hour before getting my food with barely an apology from the staff.  Users/GabeDavis

20080408 13:53:16 nbsp 1:30am last night and the girlfriend is depressed and needing a drive and food.  No good sit down places in Davis open that late on Monday night so we hit the freeway and headed West.  Stopping in Dixon at the Pitt School Road exit we first spied the IHOP but the place was poorly lit, had dirty windows and its freeway sign was burnt out.  Across the street we noticed the Dennys and it appeared clean, well lit and we gave it a shot.  Pancakes for her, bacon cheesburger for me.  Food was prepared well, fresh, and served nicely.  Kind of greasy but I didnt have the highest hopes.  Still overall I cleaned the plate and needless to say we both left happier and with full stomaches.  Certainly worth a shot if its late night and you need to get out.   Users/loneshark

20080408 20:50:05 nbsp went to the one on Main Street in Woodland a couple months ago for breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs: Im pretty sure they took eggs from a carton, stuck them in a petri dish and microwaved them. It was pretty bad.  Users/ElleWeber

20100306 21:15:25 nbsp As of February 27, 2010, the Dennys in Dixon has no WiFi. Though the night staff was extremely nice and the food was regular Dennys fare, the closest place to get it is a McDonalds down the street.  And I called the West Sacramento location and the guy on the phone says they dont have WiFi either. Users/facingit
