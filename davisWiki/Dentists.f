Dentists! Brush twice daily, floss, and visit your dentist at least every six months... more frequently as you age and wither. Dentistry within the US tends to take a primarily preventive approach, while dentistry in other countries is typically more corrective; there are probably both economic and cultural reasons for this, but international visitors may want to keep in mind that preventive health care (including optometrists vision care) is often covered by employee insurance.  If you have any questions about a dentist, look them up in the states http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/wllqryna$lcev2.startup?p_qte_codeDDS&p_qte_pgm_code3610 list of dental licenses.

In case you were wondering, fluoride is not added to the municipal water in Davis.  To learn more about fluoride check out the Water Fluoridation page.  Supposedly more than half of US municipalities add fluoride to their water supply to help reduce the risk of tooth decay among citizens.  You can read about the debate a bit wiki:wikipedia:Water_fluoridation on Wikipedia and buy a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash if you want to get the daily dose of fluoride that you may have grownup on.

Note that some categories, such as cosmetic and family dentistry are primarily marketing terms  most general dentists can and do perform the same procedures as those who market themselves using these terms.

Whats with the crappy dentists in Davis? Is it too much to ask for a competent, honest, nice dentist? Any recommendations?
 Who knows, but there might be room for some Dental Fraud discussion of this topic.



20061221 15:08:38 nbsp Dr. Chantry and Dr. Arya in his office are both great. Users/JenniferKucich

20070315 22:46:53 nbsp Are there any decent dentists that are part of the PMI network in the area?  Philip Gin is the only one in Davis, and I dont like the reviews.  I tried University Dental in Woodland, and I spent 3 hours there while they did half a cleaning and a 45 second exam, after which they recommended a lot of work I know I don’t need.  The rest of the dentists listed as within 15 miles are in West Sacramento or Sac, and I can’t find any information on any of them.  Does anyone know anything about any of these dentists? Users/MjMartin

20070413 13:01:00 nbsp Personally, I wouldnt go to Dr. Gins office. Not to mention, I guess Im not the only one who posted a negative review.  Users/PeterPaik

20070425 16:26:27 nbsp This is about Coral Bay Family Dentistry, Dr. Tracey Cook.  One of my crowns fell off.  They glued it back on (cost: over $82!!) and said they could either patch it up or put on a new crown.  I decided to get a new crown  when they did the work, instead of needing to make a new temporary crown, they just put the old crown back on while waiting for the new crown to be made.  I asked for a discount off the over $400 balance (after my insurance paid half of the $815 cost) and they only took $15 off for not needing to make the temporary crown.  Im pretty sure that if I just went in there and asked to have a temporary crown made up, they would have charged a bit more than $15.  I got a new dentist. Users/DavisGradStudent

20070729 14:03:04 nbsp Dr. Kimberly Anderson isnt on this list, but shes great, though I hear shes not taking new patients.  (everyone I know goes to her, so I guess thats not surprising)  She appears to share a phone line (Im not sure about office space) with Dr. Miller, who gets great recommendations here. Users/rachelss

20070806 22:55:00 nbsp Dr. Storm is very good. I dont see her on the list though. She is downtown near central park. She is very nice and has been great with my kids.

 Users/HeatherFlood

20070806 23:00:03 nbsp never mind she is listed above. Users/HeatherFlood

20070807 12:03:43 nbsp I like Dr. Phillips (see my review on his page). Users/DanLawyer

20071212 15:39:54 nbsp Kimberly Anderson crowned a tooth for me. The temporary crown fell off a few hours after leaving her office, as did the permanent crown she later installed. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Users/KeithRancor

20080124 23:06:50 nbsp Dr. Wilcox and the other dentist in his office (cant remember his name) both have great reputations in this town. Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080227 13:35:36 nbsp I had a wonderful experience with Dagon H.C. Jones and his staff! Highly recommended, check my review on his page! Hes under general dentistry! Users/CalvinCheng

20080227 13:35:36 nbsp I highly recommend this Thornhill dentist! http://www.bcdentalcare.ca. Users/JaeCho08

20080227 18:10:03 nbsp Ive had Dr Bruce Thomas for about 17 years since being in Davis.  Hes easy to talk to and seems to be looking towards the cutting edge in tools and technology to provide better care.  I dont recall painful incidents and I have had two gold crowns put on and some crazy gum surgery over 10 years ago that I have had no issues with since.  Assistants are gentle and friendly and at least two of them have been there for years and years.  Over on Sycamore Lane Sycamore near Covell Boulevard Covell. Users/loneshark

20080303 13:38:02 nbsp Re: Dr.Lindsays comment, the other dentist is Dr. Kim Wallace. Hes been my dentist all my life! Users/Darcie

20090303 20:01:02 nbsp Dr. Bond in Woodland is amazing. He is so friendly and didnt try to sell me anything. He said I was grinding my teeth and was honest in saying I do not need a teeth guard right now.  I have had other dentists tell me it would mess with my nerves and I should get it immediately. Highly recommended. Most everyone in my office goes to him. Users/EricaMacGregor

20090810 13:26:21 nbsp Would definitely recommend Paul Johnson and his office.  Very thorough and friendly! Users/Lenka

20090925 12:11:09 nbsp I am looking for a dentist in the Davis area that accepts new MediCaid patients. Does anyone know of any? Thanks Users/Hien

20100211 11:46:52 nbsp Ive been a patient of Dr. Michelle Miller for a number of years, and she is by far the best dentist Ive ever had. Her friendly demeanor and personalized visits make my dental visits enjoyable and something to look forward to! She is gentle when numbing, mindful of the pocketbook, and always offering great recommendations on dental products Im looking for. Many of my friends go to Dr. Miller, and are equally pleased! She shares a building (and phone line, as mentioned in a previous comment)with Dr. Anderson. Users/MegSmith

20100306 11:47:52 nbsp My family (with 2 young kids) goes to Dr. Michelle Miller for general family practice.  She has been friendly and not condescending like other dentists.  Her recommendations have been thoughtful and focused on what is good for us, as patients.  Its been a good choice for us. Users/Kihyoplee

20100521 15:14:41 nbsp Dr. Jolkovsky has implanted two teeth, top and bottom, for me.  Both times I was nervous and anxious about the procedure.  Dr. J.s work is so seamless that I had no problems with either of the tooth implants and they feel no different than my real teeth.  I would highly recommend him for tooth implant procedure.  jm7sumner Users/jm7sumner

20100626 16:10:39 nbsp For general dentistry I cant speak highly enough of mine, Rich Kennedy.  Ive referred many people to him. I was petrified when I started; now its like a visit with old friends.  After one false start, I found Dr. Jolkovsky when I needed gum work and, as a result, he was my choice for an implant.  His whole staff makes a visit as nice as possible, and the results have been spectacular.  My first implant failed; when I mentioned Id have to wait to scrape up the funds for a second try, he said Id paid for an implant already and Id get one!  I did, and it is wonderful years later.  So I referred another friend, who was having problems with the dentist to which shed been referred.  She let me know shes delighted now that its done, and she looks wonderful.  All this talk about crappy dentists in Davis is a bunch of hooey! Nice, competent, honestread my lips!  ~~Longtime Yolo County resident Users/jtb95617

20101222 18:29:54 nbsp I had four crowns and some fillings done before my insurance expired and the problems started when they did the last two crowns at Serenity Dental. They could not get the crowns to fit properly and one of them fell off just after it was set. I then had to keep going back for them to adjust the crowns and one of the staff grinded off a big chunk of one of them and then another one of the crows got loose.  The dentist said I needed a root canal and wouldn’t fix the loose crown. I realized the hard way that all they wanted was money. The loose crown fell off and I’m letting everyone know about the how bad my experiences were with their office. They were voted one of the best dentists in Sacramento Magazine, now I don’t trust the magazine very much. Users/AlejandroF

20110111 12:07:58 nbsp I saw Dr. Thomas for a year for routine checkups.  It was OK, but service the cleanings took forever, and they will go after every penny and inundate you with txts, emails, mail, and phone calls.  I switched to Coral Bay Dentistry and it was AWFUL!  Looking to switch one more time, hopefully this time for good. Users/NateKingsbury

20120211 20:38:36 nbsp Dont waste your time and money with Dr. Jacobson! Unprofessional and careless! I have to hire a second doctor to fix the problems created by him! Users/YingshanHsu

20120211 21:03:19 nbsp Dr. Jacobson has been an excellent  thorough, informed, gentle, and helpful  orthodontist for my daughter for the past two years! Users/Chamoudah

20120221 22:26:53 nbsp After chafing for a while that I couldnt find an innetwork dentist in Davis, I tried out the offices of Dr Amardeep Gill, at Woodland Smiles near Costco. I am really impressed! It might be a franchise type of operation, given their incredibly streamlined paperwork and medical recordkeeping, but they are incredibly efficient and good. I was sad to leave my (very elderly) Davis dentist, but as it were, this new model really feels state of the art. They run everything paperless, even the Xrays. They score every tooth on 6 sides, and were able to track which improved and which deteriorated to pinpoint where I was flicking my wrist when brushing. They werent gunning to load me up with procedures to line their coffers. AND they had an easy payment plan to give me 12 months to pay off my costs for two crowns. Kudos! Users/NicoleR

20130804 23:49:06 nbsp Does anyone have suggestions for a holistic dentist in the Davis/Sacramento area? Users/DanielBearDavis

20130821 12:21:34 nbsp I highly recommend Dr. Ciccarelli who works with Dr. Johnson and Dr. Jones. Dr Ciccareli had amazing bedside manner and did my fillings without causing me pain.
Their office is also very helpful. They had my crown creation expedited so that I could finish my dental work before I moved  away.  Users/Albertcohen
