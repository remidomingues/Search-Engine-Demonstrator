If you were to think about all the businesses that have ever existed, youd never be finished. The same is true for Davis. However, there are a few wellknown institutions that are still remembered fondly by longtime Davisites. Feel free to add any that you remember to this page. Old telephone books and the City of Davis Planning Commission http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/oldagendas.cfm?CommissionID12 agenda/minutes archives are good research sources. The http://www.davisenterprise.com/category/comingsandgoings/ Comings and Goings blog is a useful source for news about departed and new businesses.

Make sure to add the Departed Business macro to businesses wiki pages in addition to listing them here.

For those that like to think more positively, we also track the Arriving Businesses.

  Oak Tree Computers (19911998?) Computer sales and service, run by a wellmeaning high school teacher in his spare time. Located in the Oak Tree Plaza. First place Users/GrahamFreeman ever worked, when he was 12 or 13. He hereby apologizes to his thencustomers, on whose 8088s, 286s, 386s, and (later) 486s he learned about computers.
  PC Dimensions (19961999) Started and staffed by former Oak Tree employees. Located at 229 F Street for most of its life. Built and sold the highestquality PentiumI and PentiumII PCs a Davis business ever put together.  Factors contributing to PC Dimensions nonprofitability:  Inexperienced management; handsoff hobby ownership; low margins; stiff competition: Dell improved its product and service quality (reducing demand for PC Dimensions custom PCs), OfficeMax opened in South Davis (competing for highmargin printer cartridges and computer cables), and Incredible UniverseturnFrys used newspaper adverts and loss leaders to lure unsuspecting locals into purchasing overpriced garbage.  So, after briefly running a serviceonly operation out of owner Bob Schultzes thenvacant medical office building at 765 W Covell Blvd, its few remaining assets were liquidated and its customers and warranty obligations transferred to an IT consulting company run by its former largest customer.  A teenaged Users/GrahamFreeman first encountered salary, allnighters, the joys of assistantmanagement, and his first posthighschool girlfriend while working at PC Dimensions.

I propose that right after the business name we list the born  died dates, like tombstones have. Users/SteveDavison

Wasnt there an ecology bookstore downtown, on 3rd? 4th? and D? E? What was its name, etc?

I think youre referring to Transition Books which was situated at 317 D Street.
 Are you talking about the store that was Above Sogas or whatever was there before?  I think that was called Pheasant Run or something and sold a lot of nature books plus other outdoorsy/nature type things, sorta a local protoNature Store.  Is that the right one?  Users/RogerClark
   It sounds like you are talking about The Naturalist  they moved over by the The Avid Reader.  Users/CathyWoolery
     Yeah, I had noticed it wasnt where it was, I guess I just didnt look for it after that. I dont know if that is what they were asking about though.  Users/RogerClark
The two older bookstores I remember in Davis were Orpheus and agAccess. Users/DonShor

Ive heard several rumors about a vintage (read: used) guitar shop somewhere in Davis years ago. I dont even have a name  just rumors. True/False?  Users/BigDave

  Yes, it existed. It was located where the knick knack store is next to London Fishn Chips in the late 90s. A friend of mine thinks it might have been called Kings Guitars, but I dont have any more info than that.

  It was called Kings Guitars. I believe they sold amps and cables as well. Users/KevinWan

Discrepancy to solve some day: The Gypsy Crow replaced La Bou, yet their addresses are different. Also, EVERY online map says 260 Russell shouldnt be at B St., yet I verified they are ALL WRONG. Users/SteveDavison

20060224 16:28:09 nbsp Does anyone remember the A&W Root Beer that was in Davis years ago?  I used to stop there for lunch on my trips from the East Bay to Sac.  I think it was located about where InandOut is now. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

  Yep, A&W was where InnOut is now It closed sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s and was abandoned for quite some time before InnOut took over, demolished the old stand, and rebuilt the property. Users/CentralDavisite

20060516 17:26:40 nbsp Wasnt there a Moroccan restaurant where Sophias now is? Anyone remember the name? Users/JimEvans

  20070107 03:35:03 nbsp Well Sophias immediate predecessor was Vietnamese food, but perhaps there was a Moroccan place prior to that. Users/JaimeRaba

  20070107 18:15:04 nbsp The front part of Sophias use to be a Vietnamese restaurant (Tammys), but originally when Sophias moved to that shopping area it was just in the back where a Moroccan restaurant use to be (I think). Users/JimEvans

  20070111 12:15:13 nbsp There was indeed a Moroccan restaurant before Sophias Thai Kitchen. Sophia herself got her start running the kitchen component of what was then The Paragon (now Froggys). A little over a year later (1995), she and her husband took over the space that the Sophias restaurant portion now occupies. The name of the Moroccan place was Marrakesh. For a while, there was a sign hanging in the kitchen from the old restaurant. From what Im told, the Thai Room is a remnant of the old Moroccan place. Prior to its opening, the bar portion of Sophias was Saigon Cafe, and before that Tammys Cafeboth Vietnamese restaurants. Before that it was a deli/sandwich shop called Orange Court Cafe. The woodendoored cold storage lockers on the north wall of the bar where the bartenders change kegs and retrieve extra beer are the original lockers from the deli. The couch in the bar that rests under string lights is where the stove used to be, and you can see there is now a small skylight where the exhaust system used to lead to the roof. In fact, the entire area where there is low seating (behind the fishtank) was a closed off kitchen. Users/KevinWan

20070324 15:47:16 nbsp Wasnt there a XXX drivein where the corn fields are East of Davis near the causeway?  I remember seeing it as a kid when we drove through the area.  Westland I believe was the name, or something close to that. Users/DavidGrundler
  Pretty certain it was Westlane.  Users/EdHenn
  Yes, it was Westlane.  It burned down in the late 80s and was eventually replaced by the soccer stadium... I think the bordering fence is the last remaining item from the theater.  For a while, it was used as the worstkeptsecret place for High School drinking parties... the cops would usually show up right as the kids did.  I also remember a military helicopter crew getting busted for hovering in front of the screen in the late 70s.Users/OldDavis73
  The XXX theater is a soccer stadium now.  Would that be ironic, or no? Users/Davidlm

20070601 14:42:57 nbsp There used to be an ice creamery over in the G Street Shopping Centerit wasnt Colleens, was it?  Or was that more downtownish? Users/KevinChin
  That location had Marvellis / Leatherbys (documented above), but I think it was a Vics even before that.  I remember the name Colleens but not at that location.  Users/EdHenn
  Colleens was just west of the downtown Togos (and across from Professors Pizza), I believe. Users/JimEvans
  Yes, it was originally Vics! I want to say it was closed down entirely before Leatherbys moved in in the mid80s. Users/OldDavis73

20070627 20:31:13 nbsp Anybody remember a very small bookstore in a house on the west side of D street between 3rd and 4th, like a long time ago?  My wife and I walked by there tonight and thought of it, but couldnt remember the name. Users/EdHenn
agAccess? Users/DonShor

Does anyone remember the breakfast place in Albertsons plaza perhaps where Guadalajara is now or perhaps where McDonalds is? It was open in the early 90s and seemed like a family business.  Users/JimEvans

20070824 02:42:22 nbsp also on that same note, id like to see this page more timeliney, with most recent closures at the top and oldest at the bottom. . .maybe separated by years instead of business category? Users/KellyCorcoran
   Excellent idea.  If you do that, it might be a good idea to mix the categories as well. Users/JabberWokky
   Check out the Davis Timeline for things yearbyyear.  Users/LoisRichter

20080425 13:52:26 nbsp There used to be a place on olive drive called Bikes and Brews  it was a pub and bike repair shop, I think it was there in 1999 in the location that is now a martial arts studio and was a PC game store before that.  I never went here but I always wanted to.  It souded like a very nice thing for Davis.  Does anyone remember? Users/DagonJones
 Was that related to Real Bicycles?  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080814 16:20:01 nbsp Did there use to be a Larry Blakes in Davis? And if so what or is it still a place of business today? Users/perleystone

Yes, roughly across from where the log cabin is downtown.  Users/DonShor

Where Seasons is now. Used to be much funkier building, but it was a great upstairs deck looking over the tracks.

  20110805 09:22:11 nbsp OK, so my folks tell me that Larry Blakes was upstairs, Larry Blakes Cellar was downstairs (logical), located at the spot where the theaters/parking garage (originally Holiday Cinema, now Regal) was built @ 1st and F St. Users/OldDavis73

  2011 nbsp The Rathskeller was downstairs of Blakes  where the underground parking behind the hotel is.  It was dark and collegelike; with booths, graffiti, beer, and pizza.  Upstairs was where you went on a date, downstairs where you hung out with friends.  Users/LoisRichter


20080909 01:34:55 nbsp Bogeys Books deserves a tombstone in the Departed Business cemetery.  Id move it myself but Im not sure how. Users/SteveGreen
  Yep, it does.  Added!   Users/WesHardaker

20100730 14:11:00 nbsp State Market. Independent grocery. Was the last downtown supermarket (2nd and D). Moved to the current RiteAid site on Russell when they tore it down to build that bank thing. Gone since, what?, 199something.
 Users/MonegalReilly

  I believe the downtown location closed in the early 80s, I want to say 82 or 83.  It had old wooden floors and wooden shopping carts. Users/OldDavis73

  State Market had three stores once. Store #1 was gone before I got here in 1968 (maybe on G at 6th St?); store #2 was where the Bank of Dixon Building is now; and store #3 was at the RiteAid site on Russell & Anderson.  After the family closed all of their stores, they reopened another in University Mall  where the WorldMart is now. But that one didnt last too many years. Users/LoisRichter

20110713 17:50:06 nbsp I dont see AJ bumps on there, era mid 70s. Also there was an Italian restaurant on olive drive called Gizeppies, I remember eating there in the late 60s, early 70s and I remember that it was pretty damn good.  Users/Theangrydiner

Giuseppes I think  great pizza! Users/PaulKillam

20110713 18:30:37 nbsp Does anyone remember the gun smith? A little bit west of H St. and 8th. Users/Theangrydiner

20110713 18:40:54 nbsp There was a bar/night club on south highway 113 when it was only 2 lanes to woodland to Davis and it was called the Cat Patch at night they had a girl in a bikini who would dance in a glass looking booth on the roof of the building, it was lit up, you could see it from the freeway, we would always know when to look when my dad would say Dont look Wish i had more info Users/Theangrydiner
  Davis porn in the 1970s: the Cat Patch, the drivein theater south of town, and of course Georges Cherry Tree on the edge of Dixon.... Users/DonShor

20110804 16:44:34 nbsp How about a section for Banks? I remember the bank at 4th and E (now Chase) was previously a Washington Mutual.  Ill probably miss a few in between, but some time before that it was a Sacramento Savings bank... and way back in the 70s, it was actually a toy store(!) They had huge model trains inside (bigger scale than Discoveries).  Awesome. Users/OldDavis73

20111104 18:15:34 nbsp There was a restaurant in the mall near Anderson Davis Shell  Angelas Italian Kitchen  midSeventies, Id say. Love, love, loved that place. They used to cut the pizzas into square pieces...  Users/PaulKillam

20111130 00:09:34 nbsp What was the name of the 1970s bookstore on Second between F & G? Epicenter? The guys who ran it had a good selection of poets, radicals, and local authors.  Users/LoisRichter

20130122 14:55:02 nbsp I humbly would like to add the two businesses I owned, from 1980 to 1983.  The first was Drop of a Hat, in Orange Court in front of the Sandwich Company.  Started on a whim and a prayer right after college, we sold (a very few) hats and accessories.  Our crowning moment was selling a hat to Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead when he was in town.  We converted over to Games Plus, with about 13 video arcade games and a small collection of roleplaying supplies.  We were the first free standing arcade in Davis, but could not compete with The Library and Atlantis, and went out after our lease was up in 1983. Users/RobRodgers

20140704 10:53:01 nbsp Hi! Im looking for a small Japanese Restaurant that closed, probably about 15 years ago... was my favorite restaurant to go to when I was a kid when we lived there in the 1990s. I remember it was in walking distance from the Regal 6 movie theater. Not visible from the street, had to walk through a small courtyard to get there. Really small inside, everything made fresh. Had the BEST Japanese meatballs over rice (4 meatballs seasoned, over white rice, topped with a sweet sauce and garnished with green onions), and I havent been able to find anything like it since. Great homemade salad dressing too... kind of like the mainstream asian/oriental dressing seen now in grocery stores/Wendys, but back then they were the only ones that made it, so fresh and delicious ahead of the times :) This food did something to my brain, bc I miss and crave it from time to time! After looking at this website, I think it may have been Kamon Japanese Restaurant @ 129 E St, where Davis Noodle City is now. Im visiting Davis this fall (from VA) and was hoping to see if anyone knows if they closed, moved, changed their name. Love those Japanese meatballs over rice!!!

Sad to see Osaka Sushi closed too, that was my other favorite restaurant as a kid. Yummy sesame chicken, fun sushi boats... and their Farmers Market foodcart that served teriyaki chicken on a stick was the best!!!


Thank you for your help!!!


P.S. Great website, I know its accurate bc Professors Pizza (my familys old pizza parlor) even made the list. Incredible! Users/ChrissyMeyers
 The small courtyard is probably Orange Court, I dont think it was Mansion square. When you visit you should be able to remember exactly where it was you seem to have a pretty good guess so far. Daubert

  Chrissy, you are definitely talking about Kamon. It closed about 10 to 12 years ago. I miss it too.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20140714 11:42:16 nbsp Barneys Records actually shut down around 1992 or 1993 or so. I remember buying the Metallica black album there that came out in 1991. So, it was not the mid80s as you have listed.  Users/KenGreen
