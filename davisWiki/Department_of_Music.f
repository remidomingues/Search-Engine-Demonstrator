An effort to fund a new http://recitalhall.ucdavis.edu/ Recital Hall is currently underway.

The Department of Music at UC Davis offers a music major, music minor, and a graduate degree. Areas of study include performance, theory/composition, history, and ethnomusicology. They host all sorts of events throughout the school year, including many free events. The free concerts typically are at the Mondavi Center and start promptly at 12:05PM. There are also scholarly events (open to all) such  as the composer forum and Valente lectures. The schedule is different every quarter. See http://music.ucdavis.edu/events events calendar. Printed events lists may also be available.

The department was established on July 1, 1958 though its prehistory goes back to 1952. It has had illustrious artistsinresidence such as David Tudor (Winter 19661967), John Cage (Fall 19691970), and Jaap Blonk (19961997).

The Music Department maintains an Early Instruments Collection for use in period musical performances, such as the concerts by the Baroque Ensemble.

The Music department is one of the most downtoearth and happy departments on campus. Lifelong friendships often start here.  Not only that, but the academic program is solid and the professors are brilliant and accessible.

Music students/majors/graduates on Daviswiki include Users/ElenkaProulx, Users/MargieHalloran, Users/EricPrice, Users/AndrewBanta, and Users/IanMartyn.  And most of them practically live in the music building because they have solely music classes for the majority of their time at UCD.

If you graduated from the Music Department as a major or minor or are an honorary member (you knowplayed in University Symphony Orchestra UCDSO forever, worked in the library, etc.), you can join our    http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseactiongroups.groupProfile&groupid100975818&Mytoken6404F65D9387444096E781D475F171101332240828 Myspace group.  You may have fond memories of Blue Polo Shirt Day, a traditional holiday unique to the department.
