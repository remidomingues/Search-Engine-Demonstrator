The Department of Plant Sciences is in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.  The department was formed in 2004 through the merger of classic UCD departments of Agronomy and Range Science, Pomology, Vegetable Crops Vegetable Crops & Weed Science and Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry.
