Derby Days is Sigma Chis annual philanthropic event aimed to raise money for the Childrens Miracle Network. Sigma Chi has officially affiliated itself with Childrens Miracle Network since 1992, and now raises funds at chapters across the country through various events such as this. Childrens Miracle Network is a nonprofit alliance of 170 hospitals throughout the United States and Canada dedicated to research and community outreach, and to providing the finest care for 17 million children a year with diseases and injuries of every kind, from broken bones to cancer.

Derby Days, founded in 1934 at UC Berkeley, offers an excellent opportunity for public relations while making a contribution to a deserving cause as well as promoting Greek Life as a whole. Since its inception, Derby Days has raised over $2 million nationwide for numerous philanthropies. In fact, such a program is a pioneer among mens fraternities.

Derby Days pits UC Davis sororities against each other in an arena of friendly competition in this weeklong event in order to raise money for charities. The sororities earn points for both event participation and their generous contributions. The week usually commences with a Derby Chase, where sororities chase brothers wearing pointvalued derby hats for an exciting start to the week. Other events include a judged doorpainting competition, penny wars, a Yoloberry fundraiser, a dunk tank extravaganza, and a date auction. The first place prize for the winning sorority is a $1000 donation to their chosen philanthropy organization. 100% of the  revenues are split evenly between Sigma Chis philanthropies of choice: locally to the Sac Kids Hospital and to the Childrens Miracle Network.
