Update: 11/1/11: Walker Hall is no longer the Design building. The Design department has been moved to Cruess Hall while the Design advisor is located in the Art Building



Located in Walker Hall, Design is a popular major at UC Davis, with a http://design.ucdavis.edu/ nifty website of its own with descriptions of the three designspecific emphases which include: visual communication, fashion and textiles, and interior architecture. In Fall 2005, the design department moved from the College of Ag to the College of Letters and Science, changing many department logistics: A portfolio is no longer required for admission as it was back in the College of Ag due to collegespecific restrictions about admission to Letters and Science majors. Design majors must choose one of the three emphases, as a comprehensive degree is no longer an option. Courses are constantly being changed, renumbered, and more often removed due to budget cutsone of the many frustrating parts about the department, as any design major would be happy to tell you (or more likely, rant) more about.

The Design Department has its own Design Museum located on the first floor of Walker Hall, as well as drafting studios, sewing labs, and computer labs. Design students also have access to the buildings Tool Room that lends students anything they need for a project, including drafting supplies, sewing and weaving supplies, and photo related equipment. TB 112 and a few other Temporary Buildings used to belong to Design but are being vacated and removed by summer 2010 to make room for the new Student Community Center.
