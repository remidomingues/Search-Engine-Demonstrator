Desktop Enterprise Solutions was a computer repair service at UC Davis.  Their services were available for UCD students and departments. Students were billed directly to their student account, and departments were billed via Recharge Numbers recharge.

They were replaced by IT Professional Services

All their services were listed on their website, but for a student that has significant computer issues, this was a great place. Their unit was perfectly equipped for dealing with software problems like massive virus/spyware/adware infestation. (i.e., my computer turns on but everything is slow and the internet doesnt work right!) . If you had hardware problems like a cracked laptop screen or you spilled coke into your computer, which subsequently caught on fire, they wouldnt have able to help you too much.

DES could be hired by departments on campus for consulting on various issues, and was been hired by some departments who have no tech staff at all.

  See the Computers and Electronics entry for businesses that sell computers, or the Computer Repair entry for help when they break.
