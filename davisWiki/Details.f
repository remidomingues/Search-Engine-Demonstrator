20070908 14:58:34 nbsp I spotted a burgundy Suburban (1999 and earlier model though) in Sacramento with significant front bumper damage and reported it to the CHP. I got a partial plate and had more details but they didnt seem to be interested in the details. The first thing I was told on the phone with them was that they were actually looking for a Blazer . . . different models than davisenterprise article but unless specifics are truely known then the exact model shouldnt matter.
