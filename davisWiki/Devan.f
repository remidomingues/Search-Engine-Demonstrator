20090928 10:46:12 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Devan, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the info on YAL... if youre a member, there are some questions that were asked on the entry that I made some guesses about (based on reading the website).  Also, if you are a member, since you guys dont have a local chapter website yet, one general question is how tightly aligned with the national organization are you?  Can it be assumed that the local chapter agrees with the national groups statements?  Once again, welcome to the wiki! wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
