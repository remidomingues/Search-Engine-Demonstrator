When I was a young boy I dreamed of life in the big city. Yes it was fascinating to me. The bright lights thrilled me, the taxi cabs honking and the business men talking on their cellular telephones sparked my curiosity. But alas, I was a simple farm boy from central Iowa. The city was not a place for children like me.  I took college preparatory classes at the town high school and joined scholarly clubs and such. While my chums were playing football and enjoying small town life, I stayed inside and studied. My big city dreams could only be achieved through hard work and commitment. And then one day, when i was fifteen years of age I met another young chap. This ones named was Devin Croda. I was spending time with my dog Rex on the bridge behind the cornfields skipping stones into the water. Devin approached on his razor scooter. He was alright; nothing that special.
