Devin Hough is a Davis resident.  He crafts beautiful violins, and violas.  He specializes in the construction of period instruments.  Given his vast depth of knowledge, he is an excellent canidate to help maintian the early instruments collection for the university.  In addition to the more main stream instruments, such as the violin and viola, he crafts other instruments that are not as well known.  Prime examples would be the viola da gamba.  If you are in the need for a repair or even just wishing to obtain information, Devin is an excellent resource.  A kind and intelligent man.

I will contact Devin and see about some contact information. Users/AndrewBanta
