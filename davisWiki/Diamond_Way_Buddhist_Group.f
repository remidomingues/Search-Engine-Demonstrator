The Davis Diamond Way Buddhist group was started by Alzada Magdalena, L. Ac. in 2004. For many years we met at my office, The Healing Arts.  Last year I moved to Oregon, and now come to Davis once a month to see patients and to hold meditations.  You are welcome to join us  look at the dates above for the summer 2012 meditation schedule.  We will be reading and discussing Lama Ole Nydahls latest book, Buddha and Love. Find it at Amazon  http://www.amzn.com/1937061841

There are many Diamond Way groups around the world, and the Davis group benefits from being close to San Francisco, one of the main centers.  We drive into San Francisco to hear teachers and to hear the Lamas lectures when he is in the San Francisco Center.  We are also very close to the Western Retreat Center, so it is convenient to go to retreats often.  Please look online at http://diamondway.org/sf to find out upcoming activities.





From the Diamond Way website:

Diamond Way Buddhist Groups DavisSacramento and Nevada City are part of an international network of over 600 meditation centers in the Karma Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The centers were founded and are directed by Lama Ole Nydahl according to the wishes of H.H. the 16th Karmapa. They are now under the spiritual guidance of H.H. the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, Thaye Dorje.

The main practice in all our centers is the Guru Yoga meditation on the 16th Karmapa. This meditation is guided in English and involves visualization and mantra recitation, allowing space, clarity and joy to naturally arise.

There is a relaxed social atmosphere in the centers and questions are encouraged. Other activities include group readings, teachings and dharma video viewing. These  meditation evenings are open to the public and are free of charge.

For other Buddhist groups in Davis see Buddhism or Spiritual Organizations.
