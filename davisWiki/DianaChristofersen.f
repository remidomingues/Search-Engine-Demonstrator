Greetings to you, if reading this. I actually reside in Woodland myself, but I am linked to the city of Davis by the fact that my boyfriend worked for the UC for the past 5 years and I have been a student at the UC for ~2 years now. BUT I just joined the Davis wiki..

I do enjoy eating food...in general. I like good/decent food, and will eat just about anything. I must seriously recommend {{{The Waterboy}}} if youre looking for a nice meal in Sacramento its fine dining, but not overpriced. Probably one of the best restaurants in Sacramento.

I also highly recommend {{{Addis Ababa}}}, an Ethiopian restaurant. While this is simple fare (and probably not very interesting for vegetarians) I was struck by the overall excellent quality of food and attention to detail paid by the owners of the restaurant. What I mean by this is that the food was flavorful and well prepared, the cold beer was very tasty and fresh, and the spiced tea (not unlike a milkfree chai) was perfectly prepared. I received an overall good feeling from this restaurant, and would recommend it highly to anyone seeking to try something new.

Also recommend: buying wine in Davis. Valley wine company, Davis Food Coop Davis coop, and Tucos Wine Market and Cafe Tucos wine bar are all excellent wine retailers that are not looking to rip you off... unlike, say, David Berkeleys in Sacramento.

About myself...cooked professionally for a while. Fine dining, grill, saute, salads, shucking oysters, flipping eggs Will be graduating soon from UCD with a degree in clinical nutrition.
