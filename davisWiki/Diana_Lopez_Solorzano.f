Diana Lopez Solorzano is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2014 ASUCD Election running as an independent.

 Candidate Statement 

Hello Aggies! My name is Diana Lopez Solorzano and I want to be your next ASUCD Senator. I am a second year International Relations major and Spanish and Portuguese double minor originally from Palo Alto, CA. I love all things California, Dance Moms, and tacos. My background on campus is testament to the energy and representation I’ll bring to the senate table: in just a year and a half, I’ve become ingrained in many communities, including Delta Delta Delta, AMIGOS of UC Davis, and the Educational Opportunity Program. Additionally, I’ve served on the Internal Affairs Commission for most of my UC Davis career, which has provided me with an expert understanding of the legislative process and the most effective means to start a successful initiative in student government. There’s no learning curve if you elect me: I’ll be your strongest voice from day one.

My platforms:

EXPAND TIPSY TAXI SERVICE

Tipsy Taxi is one of the most invaluable services in our Association, but due to the nature of the program, it’s always short vans and workers. If elected, I will work endlessly with the Tipsy Taxi staff to expand their hours and service, helping with the grant process and meeting with city council to secure funding for more of a service that helps save lives.

CAMPUS SAFETY INITIATIVE

The last few years has seen more crimes on our campus and in our community than is conscionable, and steps can be taken to prevent many of these terrible acts. by installing Emergency Blue Light Phones throughout the campus, students are able to: report suspicious behavior, call for campus escorts and have a sense of security. This initiative would also work to improve studentpolice relations, by having safetyprogramming events with the collaboration of the University of California, Davis Police Department.

INCREASE VISIBILITY AND INVOLVEMENT OF STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS

As a member of a variety of different clubs on campus, I know how difficult recruitment can be; Informing students about the different clubs that are on campus gives everyone an opportunity to be involved and build a stronger, more united UC Davis community. Students will be given an opportunity to learn about all the great student organizations we have on this campus!

VOTE Diana Lopez Solorzano #1 for ASUCD Senate!
