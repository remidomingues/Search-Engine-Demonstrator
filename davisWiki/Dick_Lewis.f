Dick Lewis was an athletic trainer, friend and benefactor to student athletes at both Davis Senior High School and UC Davis.

Lewis began his tenure at UC Davis in 1949 and held a number of jobs in the athletics department, including equipment manager and team bus driver. He began his 30year career as the Aggie athletic trainer in the 1950s. After retiring from UCD, Dick began a twenty year term as a volunteer athletic trainer at Davis High School.

He set an ethical tone in the training room of hard work, teamwork, sportsmanship, going that extra mile and always doing the right thing.  Dick didn’t just tend to the athlete’s body, he also nurtured their soul and was a friend to everyone.  He wanted all athletes to be able to compete in their sport to the fullest of their capabilities and with his help, they did.  It has been said that he had “magic in his hands”.  An athlete could be struggling or in pain and Dick had the ability to rest his hands on them for a few minutes, calmly talking, and suddenly they would feel much better.  Dick felt that he had been given a gift and he needed to share it, which he generously did.  When he wasn’t on the field, his home was open to all athletes, day or night.  Dicks service to DHS athletes didn’t end when they graduated.  Athletes away at college would often come to him on weekends for help with an injury and stay to talk with a trusted friend.

Dick is a member of the Davis Senior High School Hall of Fame, the Cal Aggie Hall of Fame, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame and the California Athletic Trainers Association Hall of Fame.  He was named Grand Marshall of the 1974 Picnic Day Parade, the first staff member to serve in that role.  The students at DHS honored Dick by naming him as the Grand Marshall of the 1994 homecoming parade.

Dick Lewis died in 2003 at the age of 85.
