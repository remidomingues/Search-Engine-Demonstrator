 General information 
A wiki:WikiPedia:Didgeridoo didjeridu is a hollow pipe typically 46 feet long and around 2 inches in diameter, though a wide range of sizes exist. Traditional didjeridus are most notably made from eucalyptus limbs partially hollowed out by termites. There is also documentation of traditional didjeridus made from palm, and it is believed that the first ones were made from bamboo. Usually a mouthpiece of wax or hardened gum is on one end and the player blows into the instrument in a trumpet like fashion. The didjeridu is part of the 423.121.11 group in the wiki:WikiPedia:Aerophone aerophone class from the wiki:WikiPedia:HornbostelSachs HornbostelSachs system of musical classification. When applying a western orchestral based classification, the didjeridu is classified as a wiki:WikiPedia:Wind_instrument wind instrument or more specifically a wiki:WikiPedia:Brass_instrument brass instrument. The instrument originated from the indigenous people of Australia, and they call it the yidaki. It is arguably the oldest known musical wind instrument, dating back at least 40,000 years.

 Making your own 
The didjeridu is a very simple instrument. In essence it is just a hollow tube, and thus many simple, yet functional, didjeridus can be made with minimal supplies and effort. Some say the secret to a good instrument is having the tube taper towards the mouthpiece, that is, not using a pipe which has parallel internal walls.

 Playing 
Many didjeridu players have learned the method known as circular breathing in order to keep the didjeridu buzzing without stopping for a breath. The trick is to maintain air pressure, without blowing, by using your mouth like the airbag of a bagpipe while you inhale through your nose.
