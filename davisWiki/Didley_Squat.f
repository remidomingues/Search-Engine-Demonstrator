Didley Squat is a Music Scene local indie rock/New Wave/Dance band composed of Jacob Barcena on guitar, Casey James on drums, David Mohr on vocals, and Stuart Nishiyama on keyboards. They tend to be very wild and energetic on stage regardless of whether or not the crowd is as wild as them. They also play for free a lot.
