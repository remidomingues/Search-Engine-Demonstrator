20071009 21:22:07 nbsp DHMO in vapor form has been known to block out huge amounts of sunlight.  Its also a major component of sewage.  Its currently the largest unregulated substance in our oceans; outweighing oil, plastics bags, Paris Hilton CDs and diapers combined.  Even scarier, it has the highest percentage of all known compounds in coffee, Snapple, Diet Coke, Crystal Light, Red Bull, iceburg lettuce and tap water.  Im glad someones taking a stand.

20081123 23:17:21 nbsp Where can I get some dehydrated dihydrogen monoxide?  Although I realize that it is poisonous, particularly in its fully hydrated form, and that it is a major cause of death even in the most advanced countries, and that most of the pipes on campus are already contaminated with it, dehydration often removes most of the health issues associated with dihydrogen monoxide, as well as making it much easier to carry on a bike (you dont even need a container!)
