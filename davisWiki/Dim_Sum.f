Dim sum is a type of Chinese food that consists of lots of finger foods, dumplings, turnovers, buns, and anything else traditionally served in a Chinese tea house. However, Dim sum is considered a delicacy in the Chinese culture, and it is something you only eat during breakfast hours. Dim sum can be steamed, deepfried, panfried, roasted you name it, theyve got it and with enough types of meat and seafood to whet any omnivores palate. The majority of items contain shellfish and pork, so this style of eating is not all that fun for Vegetarian Options vegetarians, Judaism Jews, and Islam Muslims who follow strict dietary laws.

In any dim sum place worth their salt, servers will come around every few minutes with rolling carts of freshly made food, or sometimes theyll make you choose the dishes from a piece of paper that would require you to check the boxes of your choice. Note: the English translations arent very trust worthy, always ask what it is MADE of first. Theyll give you anything you point to, and will charge you by stamping the bill youre given when you enter the restaurant. Whether they speak English or not is a real gamble, so be adventurous in your selections and dont be afraid to say no if theres something you dont want, or just ignore them as most Chinese do. They occasionally carry scissors, so ask them to cut up foods that seem too big for chopsticks or a fork. Or just stab it and take a bite. Remember, dim sum isnt sushi; its okay to not stuff the whole thing in your mouth. In fact, its probably not a good idea to stick the whole dumpling in your mouth. Also, a lot of the intended flavors could be masked by soy or hot sauce, so dont automatically douse your food.

Dim sum is best eaten family style, i.e. the food is ordered for the table rather than an individual person. Your best experiences will be when you go with a large group of people. That way, the costs are distributed and you can sample more varieties of food. This strategy is especially important for adventurous people or newbies, who might get a dish that no one likes.

While there isnt a more traditional dim sum house in Davis, you can still try it out!

  Shanghai Town has some dim sum every day, and over 50 items on Saturday and Sunday! Their Dim Sum menu (photo coming soon) has some 32 Shanghai style items, and the items offered vary throughout the year. Even their normal menu offers some interesting dishes not served at any other restaurants in Davis, such as sliced jellyfish. It wont be served or ordered in the normal styles, but the dishes offered should still be fine.
  Ding How in Davis serves a dim sum platter. It consists of a BBQ pork bun, two shuimai, spring roll halves, potstickers, and fried wontons for $6.95. (This isnt really that much like what most people think of dim sum though.)
