20070524 22:10:00 nbsp Ive got to ask if youve ever walked through the tunnel that you added to the Tunnels On Campus page. Users/JasonAller

20070524 22:44:21 nbsp Yes. I got a little lost and ended up using tunnels I didnt originally realize were there to go from Wellman to the MUGA. Users/Dimitri

20070525 01:19:02 nbsp Are you sure? Ive studied the plans for MU and Im not aware of ANY tunnels leaving the quad area. Users/JasonAller

20070602 17:02:34 nbsp Yes. I took the tunnel from Wellman to Kerr and then there was more than one door at that side of the tunnel and one of them led me into the Lower Freeborn/ MU underground area. Users/Dimitri
