Dimple in Davis is now closed. You have to go to Sacramento to use those rewards points now.




Dimple resided in the location where Tower Records and Rainbow Records were Departed Businesses previously located. http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2007/06/04/CityNews/Dimple.Records.To.Fill.Vacated.Tower.Records.F.Street.Location2911364.shtml article Dimple closed down in the middle of 2012.

The Dimple Records in Davis was the 6th Dimple store. The other Dimple locations are in Sacramento (Arden, Broadway, and Dimple Vinyl), Elk Grove, Citrus Heights, Roseville, and Folsom. Like Armadillo Music across the street, Dimple is an independent music store, just on a larger scale. Dimple carries new and used CDs and DVDs and has a wide array of used video games (including old NES, SNES, Sega, Atari, N64, PSX, Dreamcast, Gameboy, PS2, Gamecube, Xbox, Wii, and PS3) controllers, and consoles. The console selection for older consoles is usually slim to none since older systems like Super Nintendos and Sega Genesis are now collectors items and thus sell within a day or two of their being sold to Dimple. Dimple also sells used VHS, usually for about 99 cents a tape.

There were numerous trinkets in the store for sale such as incense, posters, pins, sunglasses, dolls, gag gifts, vintage candy, etc. Employees had the ability to search through the inventory of Dimples 7 other stores in the greater Sacramento area and could have had a product transferred from those stores to Davis in 510 days for no extra charge. Items currently available from distributors can also be special ordered and will arrive around 714 days in most cases. For both transfers and special orders, Dimple will not charge you up front but rather will wait until an item arrives before you are required to pay for it. Dimple also has a lot of promotions going on and plenty of free demo and compilation CDs to give away.

Dimple offers a free rewards card for all customers. For every 13 dollars that you spend, you receive a point  as these points accumulate, you can then use them to get items half off. For instance, if you have 11 points saved up, and you are buying a CD that comes to $11.00 or below (including tax) you can choose to get that CD half off. Thus, each point equates to a 50 cent deduction, but the points have to be above the price of at least one of the items you are buying. Its a modest but nonetheless simple and generous system. The points are tracked automatically on the card, and it takes less than 30 seconds to set one up during checkout. The rewards card also acts as your receipt if you lose your paper receipt so its handy to carry around. For those worrying about having more things to carry, employees can always look you up in the system by your name if you lose or forget your card.

They had an industrial disc buffer that they used to repair scratched discs for $2.50.

 Vinyl 
The Davis Dimple did sell but did not buy back used vinyl. The store expanded their used vinyl selection to about equal to their selection of new vinyl (mostly current artists/releases). Dimple has recently opened a store devoted entirely to vinyl called Dimple Vinyl . It is located in Sacramento in the same building as the main Sac Dimple on Arden way. Dimple Vinyl does buy back used vinyl records but it is the only Dimple store that does.  Most records on vinyl cannot be special ordered because they are out of print. Customers should also note that all vinyl sales (both new and used) are final  they are not returnable for any reason.

 Used Item Buyback 
Dimple will buy back used CDs, DVDs, BluRays, VHS, video games and video game systems/accessories (no vinyl or cassette tapes). Dimple buys older video games/systems too, including but not limited to gameboy, snes, genesis, atari, nes, dreamcast, and ps1 items.  When selling a video game console, you need to bring the console itself, the power cable, the video connector cables, and one original controller (no thirdparty controllers allowed, although you can sell those back separately). All product must be used, meaning it must be opened and not shrinkwrapped. Anything in shrinkwrap will not be accepted that day. Trade in value for VHS is extremely low, so dont expect more than 5 cents or so for most VHS tapes. Customers can choose to get either cash or store credit. The store will not quote buyback prices over the phone (the only exception to this rule is Video Game systems). Buybacks can take a while depending on both the amount of product you have to sell or if other people are selling at the same time, but you are welcome to browse the store as they process your stuff. Only one buyback per day, per customer is allowed. You must bring a valid ID each time you sell.

 Returns 
Dimple gives store credit only for all returns. There are no cash or credit card returns. If anything is brought back defective within 14 days it can be exchanged for or if another copy does not exist customers can receive 100% store credit. If any new, unopened product is brought back within 14 days it can also be exchanged for 100% store credit. Opened CDs or DVDs that customers just simply dont like can also be returned within 14 days for 75% store credit.

 Store Transfers and Special Orders
One neat thing about Dimple is the ability to have items transferred from the other Dimple stores for free. Say you really want to buy the new season of Mad Men, but you want to wait for a used copy and the Davis location doesnt have any. Simple ask a clerk to check if any of the other stores have a copy. If they do, that clerk will call that store to make sure they can find it and then have it sent over. Transfers take up to a week but can come in much sooner. You have no obligation to buy the item when it arrives at the Davis store  if you decide you dont want it, they will simple put it back out on the floor.

Dimple can also special order new copies of items that arent currently at any of the Dimple locations as long as that item is currently in print via their distributors. Like with transfers, you do not pay up front and there is no obligation to buy the special order once it arrives (  if the item ordered is over $35 dimple may ask you put down a 10 percent deposit . This deposit will go onto a gift card as store credit and it can be used for any item). Special orders can take up to 4 weeks to arrive although most items arrive much sooner. There is a chance an item might not arrive at all if the distributor cant get a hold of it. Unfortunately, there is no way to track a special orders arrival time until it shows up at the store. Because of this, Dimple does not require you to pay up front.

 Bag Checking 
Dimple asks that you please No Backpack Policy check any backpack or bag up at the front of the store (purses are ok). This includes bags from other stores.


20070622 22:07:51 nbsp Two words: Weak sauce. Their electronica section is 1/3 an aisle and I swear, has nothing pre 2005 except for some Greatest trance of the 90s or some other crap.  The wiki:sacramento:Dimple Records Sacramento store is a priceless gem but its corwning achievements like the one in Davis that remind me why I use peer 2 peer.  Unless you want a plastic copy of something broadcasted on your clearchannel FM dial, dont bother.  :( Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20070625 14:15:20 nbsp Christopher 

Indeed, the electronica section is only about a third of an aisle, but the store is a lot smaller than the sacramento location and thus thats about all the room we can afford. There are plenty of electronica CDs that are pre2005. The section is kind of a mess right now because were still in the process of stocking and getting cards/tags for everything, but it will all come together soon. Also, the vareity of the store will increase as more people start visiting and selling their CDs to us. We can also special order CDs from our distributors for you, and, even better, we can search the inventory of all 5 other Dimple locations and have product transfered from other stores to Davis for no extra cost, usually in about 3 days. I hope this eases some of your concerns, come try us again soon!  Users/JakeJames
  Maybe I will.  Here are some things:
    Indeed, the electronica section is only about a third of an aisle, but the store is a lot smaller than the sacramento location and thus thats about all the room we can afford.
  I know ... there is a lack of demand and its fiscally irresponsible to carry more.  Every now and then though, I find a store that seems to be bent towards electronica even though its not the most financially viable option or in any way guarantees long term profitability.  Personally, I would love the selection to increase but objectively I think it is the right size, if not too large already.
    Also, the vareity of the store will increase as more people start visiting and selling their CDs to us.
  Yes, the establishment and history of the Sacramento store shows in its wide selection.

  If I want something commercially available, I will buy it at a cheaper internet outlet  plain and simple.  However, places like Dimples in Sacramento offer the strong advantage of having lots of out of print material for sale from labels that have long ago gone belly up or been acquired so many times that its forgotten in the past.  Some of these old works of high quality are locked by our ridiculous copyright laws  even from the original artist taking control and redistributing the material themselves.  As a result, some things are just plain unavailable except in used CD/vinyl or (dread) casette.  This is my sole intent in going to a record store  to get what is unavailable  and to be exposed to something that the internet doesnt offer.
    I hope this eases some of your concerns, come try us again soon!
  Im going back  but Ill wait a few months. Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20070716 15:29:48 nbsp This place gets big points in my book just for being a good wikizen  updates to this page are informative without overselling, and there is response to customer concerns!  Ill be checking them out soon. Users/CovertProfessor

20070807 00:00:50 nbsp I like Dimple a lot; I think they have a fine selection of used material and you can even sometimes find good stuff for $5.99 (Sonic Youths Daydream Nation). Most used CDs are right around $8, which is competitive with Armadillo. My only complaint about the place is the damn tape they use to seal the CD cases. It is really hard to get off of the cases, and once it is off it leaves a wonderful sticky mess, so you will either need some sort of solvent or a new case. I suppose theft is a concern, or disc swapping perhaps. I would think that if a thief is in your store they are going to steal anyway. Just a thought.  Users/ColinMcEnroe

20070809 22:36:49 nbsp Colin 

Yeah the tape can be a nuisance, but I guess it is a pretty solid/cheap theft deterrent and helps keep used CD prices down. We have razor blades up at the front, so we can cut through them for you, but sometimes the tape does leave that stickiness. We usually have goopoff up at the front so if its a big issue we can try cleaning it off for you as well (as long as there isnt a long line of customers behind you).

 Edit: As of October, Dimple is changing their tape to one that supposedly leaves less residue. Its not being used at the davis location yet but it should be there soon.Users/JakeJames

20070812 10:07:23 nbsp i actually like this place. It feels comfortable there and the prices are awesome compared to other stores. The workers are really helpful too as well as laid back. love it. Users/KimberlyMiller

20070912 11:10:19 nbsp Dimple is amazing!! Compared to how tower was and their desire to rip people off with overly expensive items, this is a dream come true. Best part is that its family owned which i just found out! When i was there i couldnt find what i wanted, so i asked for help and it wasnt in the store, but they ordered it from another store and i got it within a week. Who listens to techno anyways pssh.

20071028 13:27:31 nbsp Dimple is awesome! If they dont have a CD in stock at one location, they can not only look up to see if its available at another Dimple store, but they can have it shipped over to the store you want it at for free  even used stuff. Ive always found the prices reasonable (especially compared to their acrossthestreet competitor) and the service and selection are excellent. Users/DavidObrien

20071115 22:35:43 nbsp If youre from the Bay Area and are used to places like Rasputin and Streetlight, Dimple is very similar. Decent prices (I can always find good DVDs here for about $7) and a good selection...pretty neat place altogether. Users/LilyT

20080111 13:00:58 nbsp Dimple is surprisingly becoming my primary place to shop for video games.  Theyve surprised me on 2 occasions by having something in stock that Gamestop did not and their prices are reasonable and sometimes cheaper than other places.  The rewards card is also amazing for shopping for games because half off of a game (even if only every now and then) is spectacular.  My only complaint is that their selection isnt as big as Id like, but its difficult to fault a music store for having a slim video game selection. Users/OnaWhim

20080111 18:44:06 nbsp Some of their used anime dvds are bootlegs. And entire series for 15 bucks on a few region free discs should raise some red flags, if you actually care about that sort of thing. Users/MeeYouu

20080319 13:32:41 nbsp Dimple is awesome and has now become my onestop site for used CDs and DVDs. They have awesome service and an excellent selection. Ive spent hours walking around looking for music. Excellent! Users/VTang

20080518 00:33:25 nbsp Used DVDs are still a little expensive. Think ~$14. Yeah.... Users/eda
  Theres a huge range on the prices of used DVDs. They can go for anywhere from $1$18. There are a few factors that go into the pricing, but the two main ones are the retail price of the DVD new and how many used copies of a particular movie Dimple has in their stores. For instance, a movie they have 40 used copies that only sells for 10 bucks brand new is gonna go for 36 bucks. However, a movie that just came out within the last few weeks that retails for around 25 bucks still and that Dimple only has two or three used copies of is gonna go for 1518 bucks. If you are looking to get a particular movie cheaper you have to wait till a lot more people sell it back and the retail price on it drops. Also, the suggested retail price on a lot of special edition two disc sets is around 3540 dollars new (even though dimple, like most places, only sells them for 2530 new) so those sets usually go for around 18 dollars used until a whole bunch of them are sold back.

20080624 19:10:11 nbsp A fair share of pros and cons, though they are going to have to do quite a lot to outweigh the cons.  Pros first, great selection and prices, rewards card, organized, and the ability to have stuff transfered from other stores.  Cons, the staff, now for the explanation.  One out of five things that come in for me I get a call for, the other five I dont (And sometimes that stuff doesnt even get put on hold).  More then enough times they randomly put stuff back on the shelves that I had on hold, not to mention that I didnt have more then five things on hold nor did 7 days pass.  They refused to take back faulty merchandise and have been extremely rude and insufferable.  I even once called to ask if they had something, the call ended within 3 minutes with them telling me not to call them again.  (Without them having auditory hallucinations nothing I said could have been insulting in any way, quite the opposite actually). Users/HVS

20080710 23:10:57 nbsp I refuse to buy music here.  Last spring, I applied for a job before the store was officially open, and after several uncomfortable upanddown judgments by the unfriendly ladies setting up shop inside, I was obviously judged as not fitting of the record store employee stereotype.  (Im a girl, dont let my fake profile fool you).  All I can guess is that I was too clean cut for them.  But I can guarantee I know more about music than any one of them; I would have loved that job and would have been such a great asset.  I doubt they even looked at my application.

I know that doesnt say anything about the store itself, but customer service, a.k.a. treatment of patrons and potential coworkers, is very important.  If youre representing an establishment, you should be aware that how you act wherewithin can make or break a customers decision to shop there.

That said, I was originally a huge fan of Dimples wellestablished rival, Armadillo Music, for all the free stuff they consistently give me with purchase, and how chill they are.  Plus, I would rather support a nonchain record store anyway. GO ARMADILLO! Users/WinButler

  Ms. Win 
 How does not being hired at a store have anything to do with a stores customer service? Its understandable to be disappointed when you arent hired at a place you would like to       work, but to still hold this much of a grudge a year and some months later is kinda ridiculous. It also doesnt make sense to review any store on the basis of whether or not they hired you  that doesnt tell readers of the wiki anything constructive. Guess what? Most people who applied to the store early on didnt get hired because of the amount of applicants and relatively few positions. Your insinuation that you werent hired because you were a girl is also completely without merit as at least half of the stores employees are female including the manager and assistant managers. Shop wherever you want, and if you want to shop at Armadillo thats fine, but get over yourself. Sheesh.
 Also, if you would rather support a nonchain record store (which is silly since both Armadillo and Dimple are independent stores) and have all this music knowledge filling your brain, why didnt you apply to work at Armadillo instead of Dimple?  Users/JakeJames

20080908 09:39:31 nbsp HVS
  First off let me apologize for the treatment you have received. I am an employee there and as a shift leader I am in the front lines doing my best to make sure things youve commented on dont happen. Customer service is our number 1 task. I can give a few reasons why you might have had poor service with the transfer/special orders: First off if it is a special order it can take anywhere from 1 day to never coming. That confuses a lot of people when we tell them about our other service transfers which take 710 business days. Now with transfers the whole process is that we call a store, they look for the item,(if they find that item) the store will then send it our way via a friendly guy driving his personal car. Now that seems like a flawless plan, but sometimes the employees can write the wrong things down or we receive the wrong information from customers but when it arrives to us we do our best to get it to the customer. If the number doesnt work we just put it on hold 7 days from when we received it and after that it goes on the floor. Everything that comes through via transfer or special order gets put on hold for 7 days with the exception of New Game Systems and some New Games because far too often we have people put items on hold that others want and then never come in.
  Now for the returns, we take returns on almost everything we sell, with the exception of apparel, audio cassetes, and vinyl (as it is all written on the return policy posted in the store and given away to each customer). When someone comes in wishing to return something, if that item is defective we try to find the same item on the store floor or we run it through the repair machine, if the customer doesnt want that same item we fall back on the normal return policy which is 75% store credit within 2 weeks of the purchase. With that said, I  have seen returns of vinyl, and audio tapes because they were defective and we got the customer the WORKING copies of each.
  With regards to someone hanging up on you and telling you never to call back, I have a hard time believing that, but since you are the customer I will.  Problems like this should definitely be addressed by a shift leader such as myself, the assistant manager or the manager. If you dont feel comfortable talking to any of us because you feel we are too rude, then by all means call the sacramento store and talk to Drew or Dilyn and please let them know how we wronged you. Our job is to help you enjoy the music and movies that we all as employees enjoy. If you are hating being in our store because of things we did then we feel that as well and its a bad experience for all of us. So in closing, All of these problems can and should be addressed directly to us in the store, I can promise that no one will throw you out or let the dogs out on you.  Users/AndyHenderson

20090118 09:44:34 nbsp Im used to having no record store in the town I used to live and having to drive to go to a Best Buy or Rasputin, so to me Dimple is really convenient. I usually go there 23 times a month and have always found fair prices, and occasionally a couple of really good deals. I buy used DVDs from time to time, and a couple times I have encountered scratched disks but I guess that would happen at any store that sold used DVDs. Dimples music selection is perfect for most mainstream or semimainstream stuff, not so much for indie lovers but who cares about them anyway? One issue I have is that their new DVDs are a lot of money. Iron Man was $23 (marked down from $30), and sadly this is one of the few places to get new DVDs in Davis. But overall Dimple suits my needs perfectly. Users/Eagle

20090215 20:06:01 nbsp They have a relatively great selection of music and their rewards program is decent. However they seriously need to reconsider their return policy on video games  the no cash back policy is reasonable, but should only apply to easily pirateable media like music and DVDs. Theres no reason to not give full cash back for a used XBOX/PS3 game that doesnt work at all, especially if they cant replace it. Users/btronclassix

20090310 20:07:23 nbsp I have nothing negative to say about this store (although I rarely venture out of the Metal section).  I have always received good service, and prices for new CDs are consistently $12 lower than Armadillo.  The rewards  card is nothing amazing, but It is nice to get a discount every now and then, and I shop there enough to get them decently often.  they have a pretty good variety of used CDs at decent prices, including some that I did not think that I had much of a chance of finding there (picked up a cop of Farmakons A Warm Glimpse for around $8 a couple months ago).  When I buy a used CD, they always check for scratches, and buff the disc (for free) if necessary.  Also, despite the time range stated above for special orders, both times that I have used a special order (for CDs both times), the product has arrived within 4 days.  I have always puzzled over some things, though, like why The Faceless and Strapping Young Lad are in the Pop/Rock section, rather than the Metal section.  this is no complaint, though, and Dimple is probably my favorite place in town to spend money.   Users/NickW

20090815 18:17:46 nbsp I traded in 3 video games, 3 CDs and a DVD and got $9. That seems like a ridiculously low and unfair amount to me.

20100120 20:57:37 nbsp Dimple records is my favorite shop in Davis. I go there almost every weekend and more than half of the cds/dvds/video games in my room are from dimple records. They have great prices, considering I got the special edition of Spiderman 2 for a dollar. The rewards card is great and keeps me coming back to dimple records. The main reason I started shopping at Dimple records is because those retards at Gamestop dont sell anything pregamecube. I love it when I walk into Dimple records and see Resident Evil 2 and a Dreamcast lightgun in the games section of the store.  Users/EricGuerzon

20100909 09:27:19 nbsp I recently bought an used video game there. It was in the original case, with the original booklet and other papers, runs just fine, and the cost was 58% the cost of a new copy. The clerk who helped me was helpful, polite and personable. Its unusual for me to buy anything electronicrelated in person, but I would shop at Dimple again.   Users/mnightingale

After the untimely demise of Tower, Dimple seems to be the default goto media store in the Sacramento area now.  I do my best to keep them in business (I live in Sacramento so usually go to their Arden store, but go to Davis frequently since my parents live there) but the minor gripe I have with their stores is that they dont separate new items from used Im an obsessive collector and simply dont buy used unless its something thats long out of print, but when looking through CDs I have to flip through used and new copies mixed together.  DVDs and BluRays are a bigger pain to look through since it seems the amount of used product outnumbers new (I often see used copies of some DVDs that I bought NEW for LESS elsewhere, BTW.)  Dimple also makes a big mistake with the many new DVD and BluRay titles that come in cardboard slipcovers with no shrinkwrap on them (a very stupid practice by the movie studios which has lead to a huge decline in my impulsebuying) they stick price tags on the bare slipcovers, which for my obsessiveness renders a new item used, as your only choices are to leave the price tag on or remove it and risk causing damage to the cover.  Titles packaged like this I only buy at stores like Target that dont use price tags, or if Im unable to find it there Ill order it online or just do without it.

On the plus side, their prices are competitive for the kind of store they are they often have sales on older Sony BluRay titles for around $9.99 and their new releases often at least meet the competition.  With record stores being a dying breed in general, Im still reminded of the magic of browsing through their selection which is something you just dont get from buying online (I dont pay for downloads either since I want an actual disc Ive been buying CDs since 1985, before a lot of people had CD players.  By the way I will say that the main reason for music sales in general declining is the result of greedy record companies setting high list prices its been $18.99 for most new releases which is just ridiculous, and youd think after Tower went under theyd wake up and start lowering them.  Dimple seems to cut the prices as much as they can, but when the labels charge them a certain amount they can only go so low without losing money.)  All their stores have used VHS tapes averaging 99 cents, which are often hard to look through but I always scan through them and sometimes find rare treasures that havent been issued on any other format.  Sadly they seem to have given up on laserdiscs just a few years ago I could often get some great finds at their Roseville store, including Electric Dreams, the original Max Headroom movie and the DTS Jurassic Park disc for about 3 bucks, but they dont sell LDs anymore and you usually have to travel to the bay area to find any nowadays.

    lol 18$ is CHEAP! In Denmark a new CD costs around 30$!

Only been to their new vinyl store once but its great prices there are very reasonable and they dont seem to charge collectors prices on too many items like other used record stores in the area do.

  As far as the comment about tags on covers go, all stores do this, WalMart, BestBuy, you name it  and their tags are a hell of a lot harder to peel off than Dimples. The bigger mistake would be to not place tags on them at all so people wouldnt know how much they cost. You can also always chuck the slipcovers since 99 percent of time they are just duplicates of the actual cover artwork. As far as separating used from new, some of the bigger stores used to be set up this way, however the Davis store has never been big enough to have that kind of setup.  Users/JakeJames

Hey Jake looks like you wrote your own prescription for death as this store is now closed! Suggesting someone chuck part of a media package is a very dangerous attitude for someone in the media retail business to have, considering it is us obsessive collectors who will ultimately decide which of you stay in business!

I still make a point to go inside whenever Im downtown, and Ive made quite a few great purchases/discoveries from the stock there.  Their selection is very good, they have somethings off the beaten path, though too much in the rare/obscure category.  Im a little disappointed that theyve cut down their CD selections, but they still have a lot of great ones.  Theyve always been very helpful for special orders, they dont charge for the service, the CD is usually in within a week, and sometimes faster than the store transfers. Users/MatthewCCoker

20110714 21:51:50 nbsp NOT too much in the rare/obscure category.  Im able to find a lot of what Im looking for when Im there, but there are things that I either wait for an Amoeba trip or special order.  Still the selection is very good. Users/MatthewCCoker

20111013 16:14:42 nbsp I am fairly new to town and went downtown to check out the local music store scene. I found the staff at Dimple to be closed off and rude. First, when you walk in the door you are bombarded with employees telling you that you need to give them your bag...Try asking, this is not a goof first impression. There was one employee who seemed more interested in loading and unloading stuff off of a random cart than helping the customers. By the way, there were 23 employees in the store and only 2 shoppers and it still took me approaching him and asking for help. When i did this he was visibly annoyed that I was taking him away from his stocking job to actually help someone. I decided to leave and go across the street to Armadillo Music...it was my first time in there as well and they actually know what customer service means.
