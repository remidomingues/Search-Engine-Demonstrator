Ding How is one of those obscure restaurants that arent ever busy but should be based on the quality of their dishes. Its easy to see why many overlook this place: its in an unglamorous location by SaveMart, the decor is almost tacky, and the vibe is slow, simple, and lowkey. However, like many outstanding dining spots, its what you eat at Ding How that youll remember, not trivialities like location.

Ding How serves a nice variety of Mandarinstyle dishes in beef, pork, chicken, and seafood, and there is an impressive range of vegetarian dishes for a Chinese Food Chinese restaurant. Indeed, the quality and choice of the Vegetarian Options vegetarian dishes are such that I suspect that one of the cooks, if not the main cook, is a hardcore Vegetarian Options vegetarian Buddhist (Chinese Buddhist vegetarian cooking has a long history and is filled with amazing recipes). Also, unlike many other Chinese Food Chinese places, Ding How for the most part is not heavyhanded with the cornstarch, oil, or monosodium glutamate. Your chicken, beef, pork, or tofu will be swimming in flavorful sauces, but it wont be the thick, gummy, oily, salty glop you get at most places, such as the godforsaken booths that seem to haunt every large malls food court like moldering cadavers. The prices are reasonable, and the service is matteroffact, kind, and prompt.   Ding How is the one of the only Chinese restaurants in Davis that serves steamed BBQ pork buns.  Theyre quite large, and come in three per order (although it also comes in the dim sum platter order).  They do not make these buns, they buy them in the Bay Area and bring them in.  So when they run out of them, it takes two or three weeks before theyre back on the /menu menu.

Vegetarian Options Vegetarians have an ace in the hole with Ding How. There is a great variety of Vegetarian Options vegetarian dishes (yes, you get more than mixed vegetables! and sweet and sour tofu! at Ding How), and all are topnotch.

  1. If you eat meat, a musttry is the chin jiu chicken. The smoky, rich, and mellow flavors infused into this chicken are just unbelievably good. Its not too salty, not too spicy, not too anything. Its just right.

  2. Ding How is the place to try soup. Many Chinese Food Chinese places give their soups an overpoweringly salty/monosodium glutamate flavor and a gloppy, almost gellike consistency. In contrast, almost any soup you get at Ding How will be clear in both flavor and texture, yet fullflavored and unbelievably rich and satisfying.

  3. Most of the few appetizers on Ding Hows menu are ordinary and easily passed over without any regret. However, do try the shu mai if you eat meat, since Ding Hows version is quite well done.

  4. A musttry is the vegetarian bowl soup, which is my most favorite dish at this place. This soup is a wonderful melange of rich broth, mushrooms, tofu, taro root, clear noodles, cabbage, and a wide variety of fun, tasty Chinesestyle fake meats that have traditionally been used in Buddhist vegetarian cooking. The soup is a meal in itself for two people.

  5. For an average of six bucks, you can get a fantastic lunch combination and eat till you are fit to burst. Try it!

Ding How has a poor http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&record_idPR0000733 health inspection record with multiple complaints.

  ?? Two complaints. One in 2007, one in 2008. Since then they have been golden.
   The records online arent kept up to date.  Very few restaurants have anything from even early 2009 listed on the webpage.  Relatively few restaurants have any complaints listed since they started putting the records online, much less two in two years.  Given that the number of violations per report listed online is unusually high, and the two complaints, and the numerous comments below with concerns about cleanliness, it seems likely that people will want to know about their health problems.

Are you kidding me?  3 friends and I ate there and the soup was VERY salty, the food was salty, the tea tasted funny and we did NOT take the leftovers home.  Users/MarieHuynh

I think the only good dish is their shrimp fried rice... Users/JasminCamacho

Note that vegetarians should ask for the vegetarian menu... on which most dishes are described as though they contain meat but in fact are prepared with meat substitutes.  Users/JeffNewmiller

Normally Im a vegetarian that doesnt like meat substitutes, but have been really happy with the veggie menu here. Users/AmeliaCarlson aec

This is one of my new favorite restaurants. Its been 10 years since I ate meat, and yesterday was the first time since then that Ive been able to eat won ton soup and lemon chicken. I had a craving and decided to check out their vegetarian menu. The food was so better than I even expected. The vegetarian chicken had the exact consistency of real chicken, and as far as I was concerned, tasted almost identical. I might even say that their vegetarian won ton soup was better than the real stuff! This is definitely a unique restaurant that should not be passed up.  Users/TerraSmithers

Firsttimevisit comments (from a vegetarian visitor)  The vegetarian egg rolls seemed a little less flavorful than I would have expected.  The asparagus with garlic was the perfect texture with a light sauce allowing the flavor from the asparagus to blend well.  The vegetarian fried rice with chickn was tasty, with the fake chicken being surprisingly good.  Im thinking about taking a vegetarian friend to this place, because they serve pretty much everything as vegetarian.  The food overall did not seem overly greasy, as other comments on this page agree with.  Users/CoryHamma

I spoke to the owner and she told me that the soup broth is cooked for days to ensure its rich texture and flavor, which according to her allows her NOT to use any MSG to enhance its flavor.  I always am satisifed when I go, and their food is well prepared, light on the stomach and always a tasty trip and a half.  Users/RobertBaron

We got our string beans and chow mein reasonably promptly...then waited a VERY long time for the other two entrees.  At long last, we got the first entree, and were told that the second would be ready shortly.  More than 20 minutes passed between getting the first entree and the bill, which we got BEFORE the second entree, which seemed to have been completely forgotten aboutthe waitress said she thought we were done already.  I tipped 15%, but only on the prompt items.  Users/JudithTruman

My husband and I have two favorite Chinese food places, and this is the first one. The waitress is a little curt and sometimes has a problem understanding english, but the food is fantastic. Best hot and sour soup in town if you ask me, perfect blend of flavors.  Users/TarynHornen

I went there today, December 7th, 2005.  I wasnt too impressed.  Their General Tsuo Chicken was okay, but their Kung Pao was SO salty.  Their portions are definitely smaller than some of the other places in town.  Definitely wont be coming back here anytime soon.  Users/ClaytonRehmus

20060219 14:28:44 nbsp I had lunch here on Friday (02/17/06).  There was someone at the cash register, but she looked at me, IGNORED me, walked away, and I wasnt seated until some waiter walked up three minutes later.  There were a coupla servers walking around idly and yet I had to wait ages just to order!  I love how the Chinese tea bag label hung outside of the teapot.  The hotandsour soup was orange gelatinous crap with sparse unidentified objects (mushrooms?) floating around.  Okay, dude, prawns and shrimp are not the same thing!  The shrimp (which the server said were very big) in garlic sauce lunch special arrived promptly.  I liked that there were a lot of shrimp in it (eight is a good number for being 40% of the dish), but it was not impressive typical ChineseAmerican oversauced, too oily MSGed fare, which can be found anywhere.  If Id found it appetizing, Im sure it wouldve filled me up. Users/JennaChan

20060219 15:29:11 nbsp Ive been here twice and its pretty decent as far as Davis chinese food goes. I dont really know of any chinese restaurant thats consistently good in Davis. But the people are always nice to me when Ive gone (I was under dressed, which I know is hard to do). As far as food goes, the only memorable dish Ive had are the crab won tons; theyre different from the ones at Sophias in that Sophias uses crab meat, and Ding How uses a crab sauce; both are equally good, though. Otherwise, the food is overwhelmingly similar to any other average chinese restaurant in Davis. Another compliment about the service, though, is that theyll actually PUT the food in the togo box instead of leaving it on the table for you to scoop it in yourself. Saul

20060317 10:54:32 nbsp We ate there a few nights ago.  The food was great.  My test of good Chinese cooking is being able to taste the individual vegetables with a crisp, clean taste, not stale or overloaded with oil or soy sauce.  The food passed most excellently. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20060409 18:38:14 nbsp POTSTICKERS...is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of Ding How.  I dont pay attention to the time, especially during rush hours, for something that I KNOW will touch my appetite.  If youre a person of QUALITIES not quantities, than this is DEFINITELY a restaurant for you.  Umm...potstickers... Users/TinaVue

20060714 06:55:28 nbsp The place is one of the better chinese restaurants in Davis, its pretty clean and pretty relaxed Users/KillerBobo

20060807 19:20:31 nbsp Im sorry, but the service there is SLOW.  You can wait a good 20 minutes before youre asked what youd like to order, the water glasses are rarely filled, and the food takes forever to come!  Admittedly, some of their dishes are tasty, but I dont go there if I have other choices. Users/SteffiChristiana

20060816 14:09:52 nbsp I probably should have read these reviews before going there.  I wouldnt have ordered 2 meat dishes.  My friend ordered the Volcano Chicken and I ordered some combination seafood dish.  Mine came out fresh and tasty, but nothing special.  His dish was laughable.  The dish was served as a plate of deep fried battered chicken pieces and canned pineapple.  They then light some sweet and sour sauce (presumably with alcohol) on fire and pour it over the chicken.  Ive never been a fan of sweet and sour dishes, but this was probably one of the worst versions Ive had.  I told my friend that he was paying for the show and not the food with that one.  Service was also below average.  Some of my friends have vouched for this restaurant, but I didnt think it was anything special. Users/WinstonLee

20060917 20:42:31 nbsp I placed a to go order over the phone (Lemon Chickn). The woman told me it would take 10 minutes. I ended up waiting close to half an hour to get my food (a couple was seated and received their order before I got mine). As for the food, I wanted a bunch of tasty crap to fill me up and it more or less delivered. The food is nothing special, but not bad either. At $7, though, I would have expected more food (or at least some free rice). The vegetarian menu is nice and it is awfully close to where I live so I may go back. But Im not entirely sold on this place either. In the meantime Ill continue to try and find a good Chinese restaurant in Davis.  Users/SteveKent

20061009 16:02:55 nbsp I dont think their chin Jiu chicken is that good. Its basically what other chinese restaruants would call salt and pepper chicken. The place look okay but the food is too Americanized for my tastes.  Users/KiwiSelina

nbspIve been here once, I really didnt care fore it at all.  It was all so underwhelming; small dishes, bland or dry food.  Not my thing.Users/ClaytonRehmus

20070110 22:11:48 nbsp First off, let me say that my family has been eating at Ding How for 25 years. Places dont stay open that long if they suck, its too hard to stay open in the restaurant business if you are no good. That said, I do think they are riding on Jimmy (the previous owner)s fame a bit and not working too hard at their craft lately. I still love Ding How. Recently however they brought on their daughter to waitserve. In the past six months I have eaten there about ten times and she has not gotten any better (I guess thats what happens in family businesses sometimes; hire your own and they arent going to work all that hard to keep their job unless they feel a sense of investment in the biz). She is a truly terrible waitress; know her by her carriage (which is considerable), and her complete lack of any kind of respect for personal space or knowledge of waitserving. Everyone else is as good as ever. Some of the dishes have gone a bit bland, but many are still tried and true.    Users/YesItsMe

20070305 17:38:44 nbsp Ding How offers the best vegetarian food I know of. Users/GeoffJohnson

20070324 19:35:55 nbsp We ordered takeout, and when we picked it up, we found a German Cockroach crawling in the box. German cockroaches are the kind that feed on regular food rather than insects...etc. We got our money back and went elsewhere. Users/JeffBoyce

20070327 16:44:09 nbsp Cockroaches are present in all of your favorite restaurants, even the ones that are over $20/plate. Im sorry you got one in your Ding How food, I hope they were cool about it. The aforementioned waitress hasnt gotten any better as of this writing, so Im pretty sure she never will. Still, go to Ding How for some good oldfashioned Davisstyle Chinese food.  Users/YesItsMe

20070418 11:53:21 nbsp I like the eggrolls, but Ill stay away from the sweet and sour pork from now on. Users/AliceChoe

20070502 20:32:01 nbsp I really want to like this place, but the service is like dying a slow death and a lot of the dishes are overly fried. However, if you choose your dishes carefully and get takeout, you can avoid most of the pain. Users/CovertProfessor

20070508 16:25:52 nbsp Oh man, dont order takeout from Ding How if youre in a hurry. I live 10 minutes away. If I call and they tell me itll be 30 minutes, I leave 30 minutes later. After the 10 minute drive, I still end up waiting for 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Never fails.

There is a sort of camaraderie among Ding How takeout patrons, though. As an order is brought to the register, you can feel the anticipation and the jealousy. And when the lucky diners name is called, theres a collective sigh of frustration among all those whose food STILL isnt ready. Users/MupDup

20070608 17:37:24 nbsp I used to live near here and the food was always ready within 1015 minutes when I ordered to go. Some of the things on the menu do take a long time to make, such as the mock meat vegetarian items... they are usually good about telling you though. I like their potstickers. One time the service was VERY slow but the waitress just seemed out of it. There is a big room in the back that can accommodate big parties. If you live in North Davis go here and then get a movie at 49er. Users/MissBelomy

20070614 18:06:26 nbsp the best pot stickers and chow mein we have ever had all around the world (but weve never been in china) : all very very VERY fresh, home made. Users/hector&rosy

20070706 13:32:48 nbsp I love this place! I went here with as a group of four so I got to try 4 different vegetarian items.

1) Veg Lemon Chicken (Spamlooking with fried outer layer and lemon sauce. Very creative)
2) Veg General Tso chicken (Different from the lemon chicken, stringyish, reminded me of pork)
3) Veg Prawns w/ Black bean sauce (My friend loved it, you can taste a hint of seafood flavor)
4) Veg Mandarin beef (I was most impressed with this! Very thin pieces of meat. How do they create that beef taste?!)

I will def be back to try more of their creative veg mock meat dishes! Service was good esp since the comments here are so negative

 Users/VivianTang86

20070716 12:44:45 nbsp There are better Chinese food restaurants in Davis, but not for vegetarians. So many options for the hungry herbivore! Also, the lunch time deal is great and I would highly recommend eating in the restaurant, rather then opting for take out, because you get more food. I like the decor it is rather kitschy. The service is on again, off again, it really just depends on the weather, planetary alignment, etc. Stay away from the sweet and sour dishes, and go for the spicier ones (like the veggie Szechuan beef). If your dining party contains no vegetarians, go for a better option like Hunan.  Users/JillBenciWoodward

20070719 01:05:19 nbsp My family and I eat here once a week. We love it! Users/Surfnoc

20070906 21:12:31 nbsp I just tried Ding How today for the first time.  We ordered to go.  I was a bit taken aback by the location and appearance, but gave it a shot.  Wow, it was delicious!  It took them 1015 minutes to get the food ready to pick up, and it was ready when I got there.  I had vegetarian Chow Fun, delicious, but there were some strange looking mushrooms that looked like they came from a backyard somewhere.  I didnt eat them, there were other normal mushrooms that were good.  My boyfriend got the Won Ton soup, size large, and he loved it.  The portions were smaller than I was expecting, and our meal was between $12 and $13.  So, not too cheap for not too much, but deliciousness that will have us eating there again very soon.  Give it a shot! Users/MissL

20070906 21:21:41 nbsp The vegetarian (imitation meat) Mongolian Beef is delicious (along with most of the fake meat dishes). I say give it a try... Users/ZackFrederick

20070908 13:39:27 nbsp The funny thing is that the comments provide no definitive description of the Ding How restaurant. Everyone has opposing ideas about every aspect of the restaurant. My experience was a positive one over all. I do like the decor, its fine. The egg plant is delicious, and the very best item I had was the Chin Jiu chicken, which I highly recommend as my favorite thing on their menu. It is very maturely and perfectly spiced fried chicken. The only downer was that they were out of Pork Buns in the evening. If you are looking for Dim sum there, you might want to call first! The waiters are polite and prompt. Service was not slow. Id say just read the above entry without the comments and youre well off. Because of the general lack of consistency, I recommend disregarding the comments in general (which is kind of contradictory, ha!) Users/AnnaF

20070913 18:09:26 nbsp is this place vegan too? Users/JessicaRockwell

20071010 16:57:21 nbsp My wife and I ordered vegetarian takeout last night. The small soups were HUGE  only $3.50 each. I got the Hot & Sour, she got the Wonton. Both were superb and tasted every bit as real as the regular meat versions. In fact, I think better. Not as greasy. The fake beef was excellent. Not a big fan of the clear sauce, but the veggies were fresh. Tofu was very tasty and noodles were well done. Wed go back again and try some other dishes. Again, cant stress how huge the takeout soups were. Nearly a meal in themselves! Users/KidPixel

20080206 16:48:26 nbsp Service was VERY BAD.  The waitress was very rude and did not take our order until 20 mins. later.
Its very unfortunate that the vegetarian food is good and the service is bad. Users/tree

20080213 00:42:27 nbsp the waiter here was HOT as hell. Users/echelon

20080313 17:20:39 nbsp Given the number of comments in support of the soup, and the Hot & Sour soup in particular (one of my favorite Chinese food choices), my wife and I ordered wonton and hot & sour soup to go. The degree to which it sucked was profound. The hot and sour soup tasted like a chemical had been added, and the wonton soup tasted like the wonton filling had gone sour. I called to ask if they made their hot and sour soup differently than other places, and I was basically told to order my soup from somewhere else from now on. Which I certainly will. The shumai were crap, the pork buns were crap, but the Chin Jiu Chicken, I must say, was pretty damned tasty .... but not tasty enough to make me go back. Users/FredBarrett
 Im not surprised it would taste like a chemical had been added, seeing as how that is quite true. In fact, I think almost everything you have ever tasted would taste like a chemical seeing as how it is one. Or maybe you are only talking about bad chemicals? Did you go and drink some drano after for comparison? I call BS on this...  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080512 01:55:22 nbsp Lately, their portion shrank and their prices went up. Despite that, its still worth checking them out. Users/thelonepiper555

20080607 10:10:18 nbsp Their vegetarian menu contains many items with fish/oyster sauce (even if it doesnt say fish sauce or oyster sauce in the name).  Be sure to be very clear that you dont want these sauces in your dish, because they dont consider fish/oyster sauce nonvegetarian.  When my boyfriend and I asked why they had anything with fish sauce on their vegetarian menu, since its not vegetarian, the lady replied Maybe not YOUR type of vegetarian.  So...yeah.  Just be aware of it.  That said, if the items really are faux meat, theyre very good, and very realisticgranted, we havent eaten meat in years, but there have been a couple of times we havent been 100% sure that the item was really mock meat (for instance, I dont know how they achieved the marble look in their twicecooked vegetarian pork.  It looked very real, but were giving them the benefit of the doubt).      Users/S.O.S.

20080622 16:46:43 nbsp Their chicken fried rice was the worst food Ive had in Davis.  After scooping out the giant cubes of fat and gristle that took up more than half of the carryout container, I couldnt even finish the flavorless remains and had to go to Taco Bell.  I did try a piece of a friends general chicken that wasnt too bad, but not good enough to risk another trip.  Davis Chinese is hit or miss already, but even when I get MSGsick from Hometown I get to eat real meat. Users/Bartgot

20080622 17:17:27 nbsp I really like certain dishes at this place. Chin jiu chicken, Ding How special panfried noodles, wonton soup, and crabcheese wontons are all delicious. However, I will also say that they can be very hitormiss in terms of quality. I once made the mistake of being adventurous and ordering their broccoli beef and pork buns. Both were vile, and I have avoided them ever since. Users/JoePomidor

20080705 19:25:25 nbsp This place is awful.  Who the heck said it was clean?  No its not.  Its got health code violations up the wazoo!  Go check the Yolo county health department.  In fact, no restaraunt in DAvis has more violations than this place.  Just walk inside and go to the bathroom.  Does this look like a sanitary place?  The fact taht some idiots said this place is clean is beyond my comprehension.  The food can be good (after all its all fried).  But I guarantee if I order 5 things, one of them is going to be seriously messed up.  Just dont go here.  Hunan is a much, much better deal.   Users/JimBob

20080706 02:45:32 nbsp One of the best Veg places in town for the veg or non veg alike. I eat meat but my better half doesnt and we can always agree on a few dishes that I dont have to have real meat in when we eat here. Infact I dont mind ordering everything veg because the fake meat is so good. We never make a trip to Ding Hows with out getting some veg Hot and Sour soup. YUMMY! Users/SeanMartir

20080806 22:12:55 nbsp YUMMY! Sooo good. They have a whole separate vegetarian menu with imitation meat. Its delish...does anyone know if theyre food has oyster sauce in it tho???? Users/PalakKapasi

20080809 17:29:26 nbsp This place is highly addictive.  Not only my favorite restaurant in Davis, but my favorite restaurant ever.  I cant actually speak to the quality of their meat because I always order from the vegetarian menu.  Seriously, their fake meat tastes better than the real thing! Users/hokusman

20080920 18:44:30 nbsp The food seems always to be good when I go, but last time I went there was a huge problem with the waitresses there. At first they forgot our drinks, which is fine, but then they also forgot which type of soup to bring us, forgot to bring us sweetener, and avoided eye contact with us when we tried to ask for refills, our check, and boxes. This is was ridiculous because we were one of the few people walking in there for lunch. They lady at the cashier was rather cold too, but I couldnt bring myself to add a tip after all the mistakes and discourtesy.

Im hoping they were just having a bad day, because it has been pretty good otherwise. The Chin Jiu chicken is to die for! Users/AnnaF

20081002 15:53:15 nbsp We had the most surreal dining experience here last week. I had been there before, but I decided to bring my partner for his first visit. It was 8:45 and the door said they close at 9:30, but the place was completely empty. We waited a while & a young woman emerged from the back. We asked, Are you still serving? She looked at the clock and said, Unfortunately, yes. Despite her less than inviting welcome, we decided we would still sit down. We are vegan & I really wanted my fiance to try the mock meat they offer. We quickly placed our order, & as she was taking the menus away she says, Can you please eat fast? After we laughed her comments off, she later told us she had been working 10 hours, so we understood a bit about where she was coming from. When I offered to pay our check as soon as our food came out, she said, Thats alright, enjoy your meal, you two have grown on me.
There were a few more strange conversations with our server, but I am going to keep those to myself.
The food was worth it. The veggie potstickers were large & very yummy. The hot & sour soup (minus the egg) had a great unique taste, but seemed to contain a lot of cornstarch to thicken it. The kung pao with mockchicken was spicy & full of flavors. The mockbeef & asparagus was also delicious, but just a tad too salty. The meal was worth the weirdness of the dining experience. We will be back!   Users/AprilAries

20081103 17:52:11 nbsp As far as vegetarian meats go, Ding How has some of the best. The texture of the Mongolian beef is very much like real beef and the Hot and Sour soup is tasty. If dishes are shared, it also becomes a relatively cheap dining option. Also, if you can make your own rice you can save a couple of dollars getting food to go.  Users/IgnatPrintsev

20081228 16:27:52 nbsp The vegetarian bowl and the veggie hot and sour soup are both highly recommended; very flavorful and rich broth. The fake meat can taste a bit greasy and overfried sometimes.  Users/VinceLee

20090209 17:16:27 nbsp I picked up the other day and they messed up my order  I got the egg rolls instead of the BBQ pork buns.  Orange chicken pieces are tasty, but soooo big!  A little pricey, too.  I would go to the Red Orchid Restaurant instead. Users/strawberry

20090404 00:29:04 nbsp HAHAHA!!! Its me, the daughter with the carriage who has no knowledge of waitressing.  First of all, dont make stupid comments about what u dont know.  Were not using Jimmys fame, he is a dear family friend who retired and chosen my dad to take over.  Maybe i just dont like you, and wish not to give u good service.  Acknowledge the fact I had no proper training, and didnt choose to wait tables.  My family needed me, so before you go online saying unneccesary gestures about my weight.. make sure u know the truth, and have some respect.  U want personal space? Cmon, how big is the restaurant? My carriage will be in the way no matter what. I do appreciate how u observe me on the job, i must envy u.  Users/smokelala

   You should probably visit the Wiki a bit more often given that those comments were made in January 2007

20090609 11:16:29 nbsp My girlfriend loves this place.  She is vegan and this restaurant has a separate menu specifically made for vegans.  She can get any pork, beef, chicken dish she wants.  They just replace the meat with a lookalike tofu contraption that apparently tastes the same.  I enjoy the place also (I am a meatatarian).  Definitely recommended for vegetarians and vegans that want a wide variety. Users/MedievaLW

20090909 12:18:16 nbsp I went to Ding How with a friend for lunch.  I ordered their Chicken in Garlic Sauce and my friend ordered their Sweet & Sour Chicken (or pork).  The lunch came with Hot & Sour Soup  which was actually quite peppery  and those fried wafers, the name of which escapes me.  Hot tea was also served.  Typically they also have Egg Flower soup available for lunches but that was out. Chow Mein and Fried Rice came as sides.  We enjoyed our meals and thought that the chicken was very well prepared and of good quality with little fat.  The Chicken in Garlic sauce is not fried like at Davis Noodle City although, frankly, the dishes are so different that they probably shouldnt be compared :)  The fried rice had little flavor and was the only part we didnt care for much.  Their egg rolls were very good and had no meat (perfect). Service was very good.  Value for the lunches we had were definitely very good.   Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091024 11:38:35 nbsp we ordered take out and were very pleased  our order was ready fast and the food was great. Another plus was that we ordered 3 dishes and steamed rice and the total was only $22  which I think is extremely reasonable! We will definitely go back. The wanton soup was tasty but very salty. Users/Bardy

20091024 18:42:01 nbsp I really wish restaurants like this would start having some other sort of meat inside of the bbq buns aside from pork.  I dont like pork, but that bread is just so darn tasty. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
     Pork is pretty darn common though.  They actually buy these straight from the Bay Area rather than make their own, so when they run out it takes a while before they restock. users/edwins ES

When I was eating lunch there, a bug (looked like a roach) crawled onto my table...when I turned to exit there was a bug (again looked like a roach) was crawling on the floor.

Shudder one of the three worst in Davis based on number of health code violations (along with Delta of Venus and Kathmandu Kitchen).  Havent been there before, luckily, and probably wont go.  I am bummed about KK though. Users/TomGarberson

20100201 22:53:13 nbsp I used to live at an apartment within walking distance of this place, I must have gotten takeout around 3 or 4 dozen times.  I think youre putting too much stock in these health reports.  Ive never been sick or had a single bad dish at Ding How. Users/rfrazier

20100224 01:47:52 nbsp I really love this place.  My friends and I come here very often for lunch special and the vegetarian hot and sour is AMAZING.  Were all vegetarian and vegan so its awesome to find a place with tons of options that taste great and arent expensive at all.  It is rare that anyone is able to finish their entire meal in one sitting. I could rave about this place all day... Users/PhilMann

20100228 12:21:55 nbsp Well I went there the other day. the food was delicious. Everything was wonderful until the dude at the cash register snatched my money that I was politely handing to him. I want to say that maybe he didnt actually mean to do it but that was kind of rude.  Users/HyeRin

20100306 14:19:21 nbsp I really like this place. The vegetarian menu is like a dream come true on the days that Im craving beef and broccoli. Good stuff! Ive never had any issues here as far as service or icky stuff, so Ill continue eating here. If you havent been here before, please give it a try.  Users/MichellePalmer

20100309 13:21:43 nbsp Best vegetarian food in davis. hands down. workers are always very helpful and polite.  Users/csawasaki

20100329 14:18:21 nbsp The vegetarian lemon chicken is AMAZING. I get it almost every time. The staff have always been very friendly when Ive come in. Users/pwong

20100329 15:09:52 nbsp Question for Ding How fans: which dishes (particularly vegetarian dishes) are not battered and fried (as opposed to ordinary stir fry or even steamed)?  Either most of their dishes are, or Ive just made bad choices.  And the wait staff hasnt been illuminating on this issue. Users/CovertProfessor

20100429 15:32:12 nbsp Amazing vegetarian menu. The food is pretty good and the spinach tofu soup is my favorite. Users/Ldish949

20100512 00:52:53 nbsp Last weekend I found a hair in my food. I calmly told them about it and they comped my meal. In fact, the server didnt seem very surprised about it  he just went and told someone about it (the manager?) and came back and told me the meal was free. I really like(d) this place. Damn it! Users/MichellePalmer

20100605 15:54:53 nbsp This place was great. It was the first time Ive been here after a year of living in Davis. Such a great Vegetarian menu! the mandarin chicken tasted better than i remember real chicken tasting like! mmm. And the waiter was so nice! My friends really wanted fruit so he brought us out 2 plates of cut up oranges! Great service yummy food. I ate sooo much and had left overs which were really good cold too! Definitely going back to this place. Users/Jshpoly

20100629 00:08:49 nbsp This has been one of my favorite places to eat for well over 10 years. It is perhaps the best Chinese food in town and they are consistently good. We also order from the vegetarian/vegan menu quite often and the flavors are outstanding.

That being said... I just had a VERY unpleasant experience eating with my friend, another longtime Ding How devotee. We were just finishing up dining in the restaurant, both saying how much we loved the food and the atmosphere, when a mediumsized cockroach scurried up along the tables edge near the wall. We were both horrified and I smushed it with a napkin. Grossed out, we cautiously went back to eating. Not 30 seconds later, a SECOND cockroach came scurrying up from the same spot. At this point we had to flag a waitress over who got rather embarrassed and did not charge us for the meal, which was a very nice gesture. Then if things couldnt get worse, a THIRD cockroach went along the wall behind us into the booth where another couple was eating. I turned around and politely informed them of the cockroach heading their way and they were about as horrified as we were. We quickly left, and I think the other couple left as well shortly after.

I hate to hurt Ding Hows business because I still love their food, but... multiple cockroaches crawling across the table and wall really does kill your appetite. Im definitely not done with Ding How by a long shot, but I dont think Ill be eating there for a little while. Gotta wait till they up their vermin defenses a bit more. Users/Chronoz
  In fairness to Ding How, Davis has had an emergence of cockroaches over the last year not seen in my 15 years in Davis.  Theyre all over the place... Users/ScottLay
   Agreed. Ive noticed the cockroach problem is a lot worse. My garage is just filled with them (they seem to be coming to it to die, my guess, from the heat). Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100824 18:49:01 nbsp First Visit: Ordered the Prawn Szechuan Prawns swimming in red corn syrup sauce. I have not tasted desserts sweeter than this. They simply dont know Szechuan cooking, period. They didnt even refill my glass of water. NEVER going there again. Users/snehalt

20100930 19:33:32 nbsp So my girlfriend and I like to mix the hot and sour soup with the rice... makes a tasty meal. Chin jiu chicken and the mapo tofu are prolly the best items on the menu. The lunch specials are also a really good deal so catch it before 3pm! :D Users/mushroomdreamer

20101031 11:58:59 nbsp I love going here for their lunch specials. However, the waitress with the the blonde streaks wasnt very friendly when I went. The lunch special is not the best since their fried rice is mediocre at best compared to their house special fried rice. Going for dinner or after 3pm is pricey so I dont recommend it.  Users/Kenny0427

20110111 10:04:03 nbsp Hands down best Generals Chicken in Davis. Did not care at all for their Mongolian Beef though, but the Generals and Fried Rice are always fantastic. Sweet and sour chicken is also fantastic. Highly recommend. Good service, great food, and very fast. Wish they delivered.  Users/angrychair

20110125 21:52:31 nbsp Pros: a whole separate vegetarian menu, large portions.

Cons: no brown rice option. Also, the last time I went I ordered General Tsos chicken and when they brought the food they said we made orange chicken by accident and plunked it down in front of me. No sorry, no would you like what you actually ordered, no discount offered. I still ate it but I thought that was pretty strange. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110317 23:20:12 nbsp Ehhhh those cockroach commets kinda cockblocked me into visiting ding how..I mean meal blocked

20110519 20:24:49 nbsp I have been coming to Ding How since about 1998 and never once have I been disappointed in the food.  Some of the servers are a little brisk, to the point of almost being rude (though I have no actually complains about the service), but I think the quality of the food makes up for it.  Good sized portions for the price.  All in all, a great place to visit every now and then. Users/ThomasGoeson

20110804 19:50:22 nbsp Best Chinese food in Davis. Users/KMassoudi

20111112 20:33:33 nbsp My partner found a very sharp bone in his sesame chicken takeout last night. Beware. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111203 18:30:58 nbsp Placed order for pick up. They told me 20 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later (giving them 5 extra minutes just in case). The food wasnt ready. I went to Savemart and got a couple things. Ten minutes later, I returned and my order still was not ready. I went home, dropped off the groceries, and then went back. After 45 minutes, the order was finally ready. When I got home and opened it, the food was cold. WTF. Users/UpsetDiner

20111207 01:58:25 nbsp The last two chicken dishes Ive ordered have been dark meat, which I find unappetizing. The rest of the food was great.

Can anyone recommend a chicken dish that they use white meat in? Users/OrofinJackson

20111225 16:30:07 nbsp We love this restaurant and think the food is great!  Especially love the vegetarian hot and sour soup. Users/davisdebbie

20120110 19:35:55 nbsp I live right across the street from this place, and while I must admit, their fried rice leaves much to be desired, this really is a great restaurant! I recommend the potstickers and crabcheese wontons as appetizers, and the mushu, chinjiu chicken, and the orange chicken (Be sure to ask for white meat!)  Users/JamesM

20120209 19:54:37 nbsp I love their shrimp and mixed veggies! My bf and I get that and the chow mien every time and have NEVER been disappointed (and you know how iffy seafood can be)  Users/DanielleGradisher

20120303 18:26:19 nbsp This place ranks amongst the best chinese food I have ever eaten, I have been going here monthly since I was 10, so about 13 years, I love the place the people who own it and esspecially the general chicken, I might be a little biased as it is family tradition to eat here, but I must say if youre down for american style chinese food this is the place in davis to get it, really great for hangovers as well:) Users/ZackHester

20120308 08:09:16 nbsp My husband and I have been loyal customers of Ding How for a long time, until now. Last night we ordered take out. My husband had almost finished his meal when he noticed something that should never be in food. Yes, it was a dead cockroach. I am disgusted and disappointed. I feel like I should post this because they need to take responsibility for the safety of their food. You should not be serving food to the public if you have an ongoing cockroach problem. You cant just ignore it. All I can say is, eat at your own risk. I am saddened by this, because like I said I was a very loyal customer. I enjoyed their vegetarian menu, but cannot bring myself to eat there again. :( Users/MyBusiness

20120323 18:55:17 nbsp im vegan and this is my FAVORITE restaurant of all time! been vegan for over 4 years and this is my favorite place. i love their vegan beef broccoli and general tsuo chicken! my vegan sister visited me here and loved it too .. she even named our pet bird ding how. THATS how yummy the vegan food at this restaurant is ^0^ Users/MarissaMie

20120323 18:57:23 nbsp try vegan bird basket for a wide range of fun vegan meats! :) Users/MarissaMie

20130103 15:51:32 nbsp I was just here over the holiday break and tried using the Campus Special coupon they have out. The person at the cash register wouldnt accept it because she didnt know how to use it (??).  It was disappointing, as Ive used it here before.  I get so annoyed at inconsistent service at restaurants.     Users/Nikki12

20140623 18:21:32 nbsp Went for lunch today with my grandmother and mom. Lunch was delicious; getting to eat vegetarian Chinese food is always quite a treat for me (though I find the fried wontons a bit dodgy). However, I was very disappointed with the managements decision to only have one staff member working during lunch. Our waitress was very kind, but I felt very bad for her! She had way too many tables to manage (including a large party in the back) and she handled all togo orders and managed the cash register. She seemed utterly overwhelmed. 3/4 into our lunch another woman appeared from the back (where had she been?) and it seemed that our original waitress might have been scolded because she seemed distressed. This new woman was very abrupt and was not pleasant at all (she served soup at another table by slamming down the bowls and slopping the soup around, leaving a piece of bok choy hanging off the side of the serving bowl). I think the management would be wise to have two wait staff on hand during lunch hours. A lot of single diners seemed put out by the slow service because they were on their lunch breaks. The phone rang (perhaps with a togo order) but no one was on hand to answer the phone. I feel that the business could only benefit from additional staff during lunch and the service would improve immensely. Also, it would be best if the management retained our original waitress; the other was absolute rubbish!   Users/ArianeMetz
