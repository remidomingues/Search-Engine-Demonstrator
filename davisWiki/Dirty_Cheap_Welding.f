Hi, I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at UC Davis and I provide a welding service, doing business as Dirty Cheap Welding. I have been welding for a few years now. I am capable of welding up to 1/4 steel on my welder and can do almost any light fabrications. I operate with two types of payment methods: I work hourly, or I can bid for a job. I can provide a cheap and fast service for a fraction of the cost of a professional. I specialize at repairing mufflers starting from $40.

Rates
Muffler repair starting at $40
Fence repair starting at $50
Hourly rates starting at x$15/hrx. plus cost for materials.

David I dont have a spot welder, sorry. If you know how to use one you might be able to rent one at a local weld shop, such as Fresno Oxygen. Good luck! Users/cityfrontsailor
