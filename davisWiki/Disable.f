For many reasons, including identity and community, ongoing abuse and general problems with them, the community has generally reached consensus that Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts and those that have misleading names that make it appear they have more authority than other editors like Users/Moderator should be disabled.  This has nothing to do with the people behind the accounts, and they are not at all banned from the wiki.

Because there seems to be pretty widespread support for this idea, lets work out the details.  The previous discussion is viewable http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Community/Organizational_accounts/Ban?actionrecall&version46 here.

The Process
 TwoStep Approach 
In order to maintain a welcoming culture that encourages the users of organizational accounts to continue to engage under an appropriate username, I propose a twostep approach.  Users/TomGarberson

A summary of each step:

Step 1: On their first post (or their next post after this is sorted out), welcome them; point out theyre using an organizational account and the problem that creates in terms of tone.  Link to a page (this page) explaining the problems, and the communitys consensus on closing organizational accounts.  Ask them to close the account and create a new one using their RealName.  Tell them if they need any help with it, just ask.

example:



But this seems kinda confusing.  Maybe we skip the email step in the explanation?  They may just figure that part out if we dont tell them to do the disable account forever bit.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   Another option is to expand it out in Help.  I dont like leaving these as faceless notices.  It turns this process into a mechanical one rather than a human one  and thats supposed to be the entire goal of those whole process: keeping the wiki human oriented.  Its a good notice to leave, but not absent any personal note.  Its outreach to a person, not tagging a bug.  I took a whack at it on Users/Eastlake. jw

Step 2: Give it at least 24 hours; after a subsequent post: Thank them for their continued contributions.  Inform them the account is going to be closed, with a link to this page explaining why.  Encourage them to start a new account using an appropriate username; they can easily edit their new User page to indicate their association with the organization.  Repeat instructions for closing account and making a new one.  Account gets locked the next time JW or another WikiSpot admin drops by; page is left up so they can see what happened. Except for rare cases of commercial spammers from Asia (who are totally blocked at the server level), accounts that are banned simply lose the Edit icon and comment bar, but are still able to read and navigate the wiki.
 Step 2 could be done in a table format at the top of the page, with a look like the one on Users/Moderators user page.  It doesnt need to be signed, and presenting it as a highly visible notification rather than a comment from an individual might be an improvement.

Note that both steps can be taken by anyone; the only part that requires admin action is the locking of the account.  Hopefully this spreads the burden around a bit.  I also think its worth avoiding the term banned, since it may imply theyre not welcome to return.  Locked or disabled seems much more neutral, which keeps things more welcoming.  That might include renaming this page once the discussion is finished.
  This format sounds perfect users/masonmurray MM
  I went with account disabled, as its specifically an issue with that account, not the person.  See Users/Moderator, although I wrote that quickly, and I think the details on how to close out the account to resignup using the same email address should be much more detailed.  jw
   I like it!  Incorporated.

 Other Matters 
 Admin Notification 
So the admins dont have to watch Recent Changes to spot everything, itd be good to have a way of letting them know an account needs a ban/lock/disable.  Users/JasonAller suggested using this page (or a rename of it) as a list of requested bans.  That way anyone can add a link to an organizational account, and an admin can easily drop by and take care of it.  It also makes it easy to track what kinds of names have been locked already.
  Yknow, I do provide my email and phone number... Daubert, William, Jason (and others) have called me in the past to give heads up about potential issues, and Ive gotten texts and emails from many people.  Dont worry about contacting me: the info is out there for a reason, and Im pretty reliably affable, even when woken up in the middle of the night.  ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
   Yabbut... maybe someday you might want someone else to help out a bit, someone who doesnt want to be woken up in the middle of the night... cp
     True... and they can set their own contact guidelines and this can be reworked.  Im just trying to make it clear for the current case.  jw
       Call JW in the middle of the night... check.  :)  cp
         Wouldnt be the first time.  Usually its when the site goes down... which hasnt happened often. jw

You can add usernames that you have put a notice on to: Wiki Community/Organizational accounts/To Do


Rename page/terms

As this is not strictly a ban, but rather disabling the accounts, mind if this page be renamed and the instances of ban on this page converted to disabled account?  Id hate for anybody to think that they were banned because were tossing around the term.  Disabled account implies its an action on the account, not the person. jw

 Alternate Organizational Names 
What do people think of names like JohnAtOrganization?  The obvious downsides are 1) its still somewhat of an organizational account that could create an exceptional voice, and 2) its likely to lead to multiple accounts for users who either change jobs or want to edit under the JohnAtOrganization account from work and their JohnDoe account elsewhere.

One option might be to discourage it but, if people have a serious problem with the no organizational accounts thing, or if an employer or organization requires it, to offer it as a sort of compromise.
  I do actually like the idea of people identifying themselves as working for a place, but maybe suggest something like Users/MasonMurrayAtOrganization that way they dont have to have multiple accounts to post in an official capacity.
   I like MMs suggestion.  Why put the JaneAtOrganization idea in peoples heads if we can get JaneP or JanePorter or whatever?   Users/CovertProfessor
   Agreed.  Just inviting them to identify themselves when they make edits and/or on their user page seems good. tg
   I dislike the idea of people having role accounts, period. If someone edits here, they should use their RealName or a pseudonym. Putting the name of the organization theyre editing for in their account means they need to create another account to meaningfully contribute to the community. The special signatures would be nice, though. wl

Id say its maybe a little premature to be issuing the youre done with this account notices.  It kinda skips over the first step, introducing people to the fact that this is a new community decision. Users/TomGarberson
   The first two (the ones that I actually disabled) were in communication (one for many years).  Are some of the others without outreach? jw
   Oh, and Im not going to disable any accounts until a full day has gone by.  Thats so everybody can review the list and its not just two people acting alone.  Seem reasonable?
   Sounds good, and as long as theyve all already had outreach, its fair.  tg
...in the same vein, were all the ones that were added on the 27th and 28th similar cases of outreach has already been done? jw

Not sure what to do about Users/AdvancedValleyEye.  Hes already been spoken to (by WH?) and started up a RealName account (Users/BobMiller), but now has gone back to the organizational account (perhaps by accident?).  Perhaps this case needs special handling, perhaps from the person who first spoke to him.  cp
  I know hes been asking for help.  I think its a matter of innocent confusion. jw
   Me too, thats why I think it needs special handling.  cp
    Ill email him (his preferred contact method)  WH
     Thank you!  cp


 Three for consideration 

  Users/ChautauquaManagement
  Users/Bizarro
  Users/DavisWikiGnome

Opinions on handling these three?
 I thought DWG was already banned. And its not an account used by an organization. Users/WilliamLewis
   DWG gives the appearance of official action on the wiki just like Administrator, Moderator, etc. If they are already banned then not an issue. Perhaps should be noted on page that they are banned if that is the case.

So it seems like were currently going with a onestep approach: just the tabled notice.  Should we come up with some standard introductory language welcoming them and explaining the issue before leaving a faceless account disabled notice?  I really think the first thing step should be a welcome from an individual, and that notice should be step 2.  (See e.g. Users/EastLake). Users/TomGarberson
  I agree.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Thats why I hit Eastlake with the extra info  because they just recently edited.  I was under the impression that Jasons list is active, but ignored outreach in the past.  He asked me earlier today if I got a message back from one I asked to email me.  I do think that only a notice is insufficient.  In another case I restored the outreach so they could see it.  jw

I think that all of the existing org accounts with more than 39 edits have been given notice. Im happy with holding off on more notices until an org account edits. Anyone can go back and do more outreach on those accounts if they want. Users/JasonAller
