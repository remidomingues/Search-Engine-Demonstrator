In case of an emergency, it is a good idea to have a disaster plan for Pets your furry (or not so furry) friend.  You dont always have time to grab stuff for your pet, so its a good idea to have a bag prepared.

If you do need to evacuate your home, keep in mind that it is likely you will not be able to take your pet with you to a disaster shelter.  Although there is an increased awareness of the need to shelter people and animals together since Hurricane Katrina, you should not depend on it. Most shelters only allow service animals, so keep a current list of petfriendly hotels and boarding places in the region and leave it in your disaster kit. It is also important to have an outofstate contact who can serve as a common call person for you and your family, and this person should have the information about your pets, too.

Everyone should have a friend/family member who can care for your pet should something happen to you, or if you go out of town. It is important for this person to know about your disaster kit, and be prepared to retrieve your animals in your absence.

If you must leave your pet behind, be sure to leave them in a properly ventilated room that doesnt have windows. Have an automatic/selffeeder supplied with 35 days worth of food and to leave drinking water available (and leave the faucet dripping if they are in a bathroom). Leave familiar items with your pet (bed, toys, something that smells like you), and leave a note on your door with the name of your pet, type of pet, and your contact info.

It is a good idea for every pet owner to become certified in Pet First Aid.  These classes are offered by the Red Cross at locations in Sacramento, Woodland, San Francisco, and wiki:walnutcreek Walnut Creek.
