Frisbee Golf (also known as Disc Golf or even Frolf) is a game using the rules of golf, but throwing a Frisbee from the teeoff to the cage or designated goal. Its easy and fun, and par can be modified for any age or ability.  For a writeup of rules and common terms used in the game, go http://www.discgolfassoc.com/games.html here.

 Frisbee Golf courses in Davis 


Oxford Circle Park (505 Oxford Circle)  This is a comparatively short, 9 hole course. Follow the signs marking the tee for each hole to get from hole to hole. Each basket is numbered so you know which one to throw to. Typically, all holes are played as par 3, however par can be modified to suit your skill level. This course is very easy and a good place for a beginner to learn the game (and even get par or a birdie). The course can be easily modified into an 18 hole course by creating new teeoff areas for the various cages.  First tee is at the South East Corner of the park between the picnic area and the parking lot.

WARNING: There are usually a few people in this park studying, reading, or relaxing on the grass and children playing in the play area. Disc Golf discs are harder and heavier than your typical Frisbee and can cause pain and possibly serious injury, so be vocal and be very careful!

UCD Frisbee Golf Course  This course on the UC Davis Campus was created by a couple of UC students, with garbage cans, sculptures, and the like acting as the holes.  A map can be found at this wiki link or directly http://www.ojigi.com/UCDfrisbeegolfcourse.pdf here (pdf).

Covell Greenbelt Disc Golf Course  This course was designed using existing landmarks by a couple of Covell Greenbelt junkies who think that this greenbelt is oozing with disc golf potential.  Play the course and decide for yourself.

Chico
    wiki:chico Upper Bidwell Park Disc Golf Course  In November 2008, the City Council in Chico voted to close this course after a long review process.  It was determined that environmental impacts caused by the course were too great to continue to allow disc golf in the area.  There are currently groups trying to get a referendum to reverse the decision and reopen the course, but currently disc golf has been deemed to no longer be an accepted form of recreation at the site.

Has been reopened for use after much deliberation.
     This is a terrific course and can be challenging, but incredibly scenic, especially in the springtime.  It is actually 2 sets of 18 holes.  A front 18, known as the short course and a back 18, known as the long course.  The long course also has 3 bonus holes about halfway through, known as the labyrinth holes.  The long course overlooks Butte Creek Canyon and is INCREDIBLY scenic, with many places to stop and absorb the scenery along the way.  Dont bring Alcohol because occasionally there are park rangers patrolling the place, I have seen people get MIP tickets a couple times.  Also, the place is relatively litterfree, unlike the rest of Chico.
     The course is located in beautiful Upper Bidwell Park, but is not officially sanctioned by the City of Chico which owns the land (see the http://www.chicodiscgolf.org/Chicodiscgolf/ Chico Outsiders website for the dirty details).   Bidwell Park is one of the largest municipal (city) parks in the entire nation.  Upper Park is also a site of the filming for the movie Robin Hood with Errol Flynn in 1938.
     To get there from Davis, take I80 east towards Sacramento, and then merge onto I5 north.  Near the Sac Airport I5 will split and the right fork will be Hwy99 North, take that, and drive for about 1:45 until you come to Chico, be very careful in the small towns along 99 because they are speed traps and you could very easily get pulled over. The cops there have nothing better to do.  When youre in Chico, take the Hwy32 exit, and then turn right, going up Hwy32.  Drive for about 5 minutes, and then watch for the entrance, which is on the left, and is completely unmarked, because the course is not sanctioned.  Watch for Humboldt Rd. on the right, if you see that, keep going a little bit, its maybe a minute farther.  The actual entrance is just a little driveway on the left side, across from a big chasm on the right side, and before you enter a big group of trees.  The parking is VERY rough, so if youre in a car youll have to drive very slow. Users/AnthonyGuzzi


Woodland
    Fern Park (Ashley and Southwood)   All holes are marked as par 4, however par can be modified to suit your skill level, with great distances between each one.  Lots of trees, but most are not in the way.  Also, unlike the Davis course, this one doesnt have any holes in the middle of picnic areas (though watch those stray throws!). The first tee is at the South East corner of the park and the final tee is on the path behind hole 8.
    This course is pretty unexciting and flat. All the holes are straight shots and most only need 2 throws for the moderately skilled. There are a few tree obstacles and the park is very well kept. Note: the locals might look at you funny. There is one hole which is 300+ feet I believe. Users/ErnBro

Sacramento
    http://home.comcast.net/~discgman1/shadyoaks.htm Shady Oaks at Orangevale Park (Hazel Avenue)  This is a true 18 hole course with lots of regulars. Word on the street is that its the best course around.  One of the big perks of this course is the on site clubhouse with refreshments and discs for sale.
      This course was pretty cool.  It was woodsy, with lots of trees and winding paths.  Its not very intuitive for new comers, but the new signs helped a lot.  We talked to some regulars, who said, like we experienced, that the course is so popular that you often end up waiting for other groups at each hole.  They recommended going on a weekday morning.  Also, their clubhouse/proshop has a HUGE disc selection at good prices. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

Vacaville
    wiki:vacaville:Lagoon_Valley_Park (Pena Adobe Road exit of I80)
    This could be a better course if it was maintained. It contains a lot of fun obstacles over varying terrain. This course is great for testing your distance too, but youll walk a lot. Unfortunately, some of the holes are in serious disrepair and lack proper signage. A highlight though are the holes which run along side the lagoon and one that requires the player to throw over water so be careful because that lagoon looks nastier than the rankest homemade compost!

 Purchasing Discs (golf frisbees)

 Where to buy 
Discs (golf frisbees) can be purchased at Big 5 Sporting Goods, Davis Sport Shop or a of other stores around Sac, or online.  Frisbees can even be found at Target during the summer.

 What to buy 
Most Discs (golf frisbees) cost between $8 and $20 each. Beginners that only want (or can afford) one or two discs should start with a good multipurpose Frisbee like the Innova Shark or DiscCraft Buzzz.  A putter, which flies steady and level for short distances,  is usually the second purchase for those with just a couple discs.  Regular players often carry 10 or more discs specific to driving, putting, hyzers (left turn), anhyzers (right turn), etc.

20060913 14:25:42 nbsp About the Davis course: hole #6 has a mandatory dog leg.  What about holes# 1 and 2? Users/RobiPochapin

20070212 15:49:46 nbsp I played the  back nine for the first time today way better than doing a repeate of the front nine or playing it backward. Users/RobiPochapin

20070405 22:42:20 nbsp Chico is the best place to play disc golf.  But its a 2 hour drive north.  Ukiah has 3 courses, one of which is really great.  Oroville has a course, but its not great, but its a lot better than Big Kids Park.  Theres also a course in Novato, but Ive never been to it.  The Shady Acres course in Sacramento, in the Orangevale suburb, takes about an hour to get to from Davis. Users/AnthonyGuzzi

20070406 03:53:39 nbsp I havent done the Chico course, but if youre willing to go that far, the Novato course and another in Napa are both excellent courses through the beautiful rolling hills of CA. Users/EdHenn

20090510 23:58:22 nbsp Better off driving to S.F. if you want to go far and play some frolf.  Golden Gate Parks course is awesome.  I can not recommend it for newcomers of the game however. Users/JamesGallerani

20090717 17:28:00 nbsp I would agree the Golden Gate course is excellent.  But why travel an hour when the underrated Covell Greenbelt course is right in our backyard Users/ZachStednick

20100806 22:50:22 nbsp Theres always more room for Frolfing Users/MeganPetersen
