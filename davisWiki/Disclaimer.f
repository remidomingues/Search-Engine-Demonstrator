I dont think the disclaimer will work very well.  IM me if you want to discuss it further.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

...okay, failing that, here are my notes (from jw):

  This is strictly a content and use disclaimer.  Privacy and other issues are separate, but this is a core point to start from.  Basically:  The views and opinions expressed on DavisWiki are those of its users and do not necessarily represent those of this station, its staff or advertisers.  (Did that one at signoff for years).

  DavisWiki as an entity needs to be defined.  You had mentioned creating a nonprofit.  Normally I deal with companies either incorporated or individuals dba a business.  Youll have to add a paragraph at the beginning saying what comprises (DavisWiki) at the top.

  I removed several points.  There is no clause for outages and closure of the site since the one I had was full of references to fees and there are no fees for this site.

  The key clause I removed was the Indemnification clause.  It will have to be rewritten, but is generic enough to be available as a template on a legal site.

I like http://druidwiki.org DruidWiki.orgs disclaimer a lot.  Its not legal, but I think it gives a good informal feel:
 Unlike standard web sites, here what is posted is open to all. We make it absolutely clear, therefore, that DruidWiki support staff do not necessarily agree with, support or condone anything posted on these Wiki pages, but we do feel that all informational content is a valid form of expression.

 This Wiki offers a completely open space, for anyone who has registered, to add and edit pages. As a result, some may find the content anarchic, provocative, and at times even offensive. Equally it may be thoughtprovoking or inspiring. We emphasize that it is up to all who use these pages to do so creatively, respectfully, honestly and responsibly.

 The intention is that the pages here will become the result of creative collaboration, honest dialogue and intelligent reflection.
