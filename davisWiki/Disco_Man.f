Disco Man is a beloved blonde, curlyhaired crossdresser (real name withheld) whose presence in town lights up the lives of some especially open Davis residents. He has appeared at Delta of Venus in a dress; another time, in assless chaps, and probably in dozens of other cute and sassy outfits. He has been known to pick up some of his regalia from the SPCA Thrift Store, where he has been seen debating a http://www.webstockpro.com/Thumbnails/DigitalVision/73092745.JPG Holsteinhide skirt, skirts in general, offtheshoulder pink blouses, womens jeans and assorted purses. He is not always crossdressed, but his clothes always seem to reflect a hippie aesthetic in some way.

Disco Man loves to dance and grope people dancing around him, though he does so not so much in a prurient way as in a very free love and far left sort of manner. He was seen groping men and women alike at UNCANNY 2007, and earned his moniker dancing in a corner and groping himself rather heavily at Disco Night 2006, held at Delta of Venus.

It has been reported that Disco Man has a son, appropriately bestowed with the title Son of Disco Man. Father and child were seen at the SPCA Thrift Store in July 2008. In negation of the aforesaid, the son has been found to be a girl, though make no mistake about itshe is not transgendered. Nevertheless, she shall retain the moniker Son of Disco Man for the pleasant ring of the name.

Disco Man departed from Davis circa 2009 (?) to live near Mt. Whitney (or Shasta?) or some mountain in California. However, he was seen at the 2011 Whole Earth Festival with Son of Disco Man in his arms, proving that he still holds love for and an allegiance to the city. )
