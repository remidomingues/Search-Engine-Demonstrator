Many places offer discounts and deals for university affiliates. Some of them are offered by vendors to those associated with education, or extend blanket purchase deals to employees when they are negotiated with the university, or for other reasons.

What perks, freebies and benefits do you get from being at the university?  Or maybe things specific to UCD?  Currently, I have in mind tangible hard benefits, not stuff like opening your mind up to enrichment and experiencing blah blah.

Specifically, I just found out that UCD is the only UC I know off with campuswide licensing for the software program EndNote: http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/dept/instruc/research/endnote/   The program retails for $299, academic price is $224, student price is $114, and upgrade run $109. (Student in this context is an undergrad.)  ASUCLA Ackerman store sells it for $66.   UCD has it for free  curse my longexpired login!

Its an incredibly useful program, and the standard for grad students at several universities (from what Ive seen).  I wanted to put that info somewhere on the wiki and wasnt sure where.  On the library page would make sense, no?  That got me thinking... What other perks/freebies are people missing out on?  And do other people think some sort of compilation is worthwhile?    This could become an interesting page, useful both as an information resource and for upping crosslinking across the Wiki.  Thoughts?

There are a variety of discounts and deals for people affiliated with the University


 If you have a ucdavis.edu email address 
These deals rely on your email address.
  Microsoft is http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowsexperience/archive/2011/05/12/studentswevegotyoucovered.aspx offering a free XBOX 360 with the purchase of a $700+ laptop through the summer of 2011.  In theory you need to be a student, but it appears they just verify that you have a .edu email address.

 For Students 
Often deals for students will require verification of enrollment
  http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info Amazon Student  Free Amazon Prime for undergraduate students undergraduates and graduate students, although its limited to one user accountlike Amazon Mom, you cant share it with others in the same household. To sign up, you need to provide your .edu email address, major, and year in school. Any nonstudents with a .edu email address could lie about the last two questions, but thats just dishonest!
