Discoveries was founded by three women (Dorothy Briggs and two other ladies whose names escape me at the moment) in 1960. After expanding from its original location, it eventually encompassed three floors of the building that later housed Pita Pit (next to the former Cinema II (now Watermelon Music)) in the 200 block of E Street. It remained at this location under Briggs ownership (she owned and managed it from 19601993) for more than thirty years. The business was eventually sold to Suzanne Cello, who relocated the store to Davis Commons. The new management under Cello vastly reduced the selections and inventory, and focused largely on housewares and gardening implements. This to an extent duplicated the offerings of such stores as Davis Lumber (Now ACE Hardware), and within a couple of years, Discoveries closed forever.

Their logo was a sunburst, which they used to seal all of the presents that they wrapped.

 The E Street location 

The top floor sold a variety of things over the years, including posters, kites, stickers, postcards, and other novelties.

The main (ground) floor sold kitchenware, housewares, jewelry, greeting cards, candles, and other similar gift suitable items. They had a gift registry desk at the rear, which was popular with engaged Davisites.

The basement housed a toy shop of sorts, where there was a wonderful selection of Legos and Playmobil sets. They also had dolls, horses, and wooden train sets.

 The Davis Commons location 

Cello relocated to the end unit where the Gap Kids store is now. This new version of Discoveries lasted just a few years, closing in 2000.

Discoverys was the  when I was young, The downstairs were all the toys catered to people my age, and they had a wooden train set with tracks that was available for play and they carried a ton of legos. The upstairs was always an interesting change of pace. It was a great place! I remember when they moved, they changed the focus away from toys and more Bath body workish, and then it closed. The debt was just to much. It was such a staple of growing up in Davis.  Users/StevenDaubert
