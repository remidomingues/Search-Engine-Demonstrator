A place for members of FARM Davis to discuss FARM Davis business:


 The Chicken Coop: 
Geoff and I live over in West Davis, and go for walks throughout the neighborhood all the time. We usually go at night, so we never noticed before, but there are LOTS of chicken coops (and chickens) near the Solar Community(Village Homes) and Sunwise Coop. There are lots of different designs/styles, but most seem to have 4 walls, so that might be something to consider. I dont know a whole lot about it, but the bike loop runs right by those gardens if you want to check it out! laura

Christina Users/SexyPianist89

20100121 10:03:15 nbsp I think it is supposed to be sunny Saturday and Sunday, so we shouldnt be rained out. But it will probably be MUDDY! Be ready to get dirty!  Users/lauraAsmith

20100121 21:34:09 nbsp Hey Christina! Are you joining us on Saturday? no rain I hear! Users/RobynW

20100123 11:10:05 nbsp Yes I will be there Users/SexyPianist89

20100123 21:50:22 nbsp So, it was mentioned: we need a sign. What should it say beyond FARM? Our mission statement?  Users/RobynW
  How big of a sign are we thinking of? if there is space, I think other than the mission statement, something thats inviting would be good too.

20100203 10:08:01 nbsp OK, so how did you do that?  start a thread under my post about the sign?
I think something that is about 1218 inches wide and a few feet high would be good. I have access to a laser cutter it engraves into acrylic. Super cool looking stuff. Then we mount it on four posts, like a national park sign when you read about the history on the side of the road. Heres a photo of the one in San Francisco, when the FARMers were installing it: http://www.thinkdiscussact.org/farm/sign_install.html Users/RobynW

20100205 18:07:25 nbsp Ooh, a sign would be so nice.  Does anyone have hinges for the coop?  Im not sure if well get that far tomorrow but it would be great if we did. Users/sonyacollier
  What size hinges do you need? â€“Robyn


20111016 21:47:59 nbsp Are you still looking for horse manure? Theres free manure at the barn where I work. Check out PTRanch.com for contact details. Charlotte Users/chmorr

20111104 20:27:30 nbsp Thanks Charlotte! I think were good on the manure for now, but I know exactly where Pine Trails Ranch is if we need more. The new FARM is on Rd 95 about 1 mile away. Users/RobynW
