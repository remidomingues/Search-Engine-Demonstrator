 The Disqualification 
In the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election, the Elections Committee chose to disqualify candidate Rob Roy on the second day of voting. Their decision was based on his inability to file certain receipts verifying his campaign spending.

The Aggie reported on this http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/25/FrontPage/Elections.Committee.Disqualifies.Friends.Candidate1319727.shtml?norewrite200607290308&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com here

 The Code in Question 
According to the ASUCD Government Codes Chapter 1: Election Regulations Section 112(8): {{{
A. No candidate, ticket, or Ballot Measure campaign coordinator (pro/con) in a General
election or Recall election may falsify expenditure forms. This may include but is not
limited to: False signature, incomplete forms, not claiming purchases/donation used
for campaign purposes.

B. If the Election Committee find that any candidate or ticket have falsified their
expenditure form(s) they may be assessed three(3) violation point therefore; may be
disqualified from the Genereal Election determined by a unanimous vote of the Election
Committee upon severity.
}}}

Forgetting some receipts is somehow SEVERE enough for someone to get disqualified (3 points)? Spending more than the allowed $250 gets you one point. A candidate walking around with a laptop having people vote gets two points  one for campaigning within 100 feet of a polling station, and one for using a candidates personal computer as a polling station. Now thats pretty bad shit, but the Elections Committee decided that forgetting some receipts (and theyve verified that the numbers were correct  Rob only spent a little about $100 on his campaign!) was worse.

The elections committee cited section 112(8), stating that Robs incomplete form qualifies as a falsified form, and assessed violation points accordingly.

At tonights (2/24/05) Senate meeting  the majority of senators disbelief of this latest development, as well as support for Rob Roy. It was addressed both at the beginning of the meeting, as well as during public discussion at the toward the end of the meeting.  Users/PaulIvanov

 The Debate 

What follows is a series of hasty missives and comments on said missives sent back and forth on Thursday and Friday of Election Week. Much of this is probably redundant, old, and should be deleted.

 Christine Schachters letter to Rob Roy 
This is the email sent to Rob Roy by the Elections Committee chair informing him he was disqualified.

{{{
Rob:
We would like to inform of the following Election Committees unanimous decision:

After extensive review and investigation into an expenditure form that was
submitted by Robert Roy, on February 16, 2005, he has been found to be in
violation of ASUCD Government Codes: Chapter 1: Election Regulations,
Section 112 (8): No candidate, ticket, or Ballot Measure campaign
coordinator (pro/con) in a General election or Recall election may falsify
expenditure forms. This may include but is not limited to: False
signatures, incomplete forms, not claiming purchases/donation used for
campaign purposes.  Therefore, because he failed to include any receipt or
documentation of purchases, he has failed to submit a complete expenditure
form.  Adhering to subsection B of Section 112 (8): If the Election
Committee finds that any candidate or ticket have falsified their
expenditure form(s) they may be assessed three (3) violation points;
therefore, may be disqualified from the General Election determined by
unanimous vote of the Election Committee upon severity.  Thus, by
unanimous vote, the Elections Committee has assessed Robert Roy three (3)
violation points resulting in his disqualification.

 Igor Birmans Letter to the Election Committee Regarding Rob Roys Election Controversy 
Legal superhero Igor Birman jumped into action in Robs defense the night of the disqualification: 11:30 PM PST 2/24/05 {{{
Dear Ms. Schachter:

In regards to the Elections Committees purported disqualification of
Mr. Rob Roy, a duly qualified candidate for the office of ASUCD Senator,
this notice is to inform you and other members of the Committee of the
inherent illegality of such action.

As election officers of a taxpayerfunded and publiclyowned University,
the actions of your Committee are governed by relevant U.S. and California
State Constitutional provisions and statutes.  Your actions to disqualify
or otherwise penalize Mr. Roy without due process of law, and without an
opportunity for Mr. Roy to confront and examine witnesses and evidence
against him are in direct violation of the provisions contained within
the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and applicable to state
actors such as the Elections Committee.

Furthermore, your actions may result or possibly have already resulted
in the disenfranchisement and civil and voting rights infringement
of thousands of otherwise dulyqualified electors who lawfully chose
to cast their votes for a dulyqualified candidate in an election
conducted by a quasigovernmental body.

I urge you to reconsider your decision forthwith and take into
account the severe consequences and substantial civil penalties
that may follow as a result of federal civil rights litigation
in connection with the abovereferenced matter.

Sincerely,
Igor Birman

 Sallie Boormans response 
In response to public outcry, Elections Committee member Sallie Boorman offered these words {{{
To all....
First of all, I would like to thank you for voicing your concern and
taking action for something that you believe so much in. I would like you
know that I have read all of your emails, and agree with many points
(though I cannot say which, because of the restrictions of my office) but
I think that it is important and fair for everyone that has taken their
time to write to us that you receive some kind of response in return. I
would also like to state, that this is in no way is an official statement
of the elections committee, but the humble opinion of one of its members.

In regards to the disqualification of Rob Roy, I think that there is much
misunderstanding surrounding the situation. I must call to the attention
of many that it is not the elections committee members that make the
government codes and rules that we must enforce. Those rules and
everything surrounding them (such as the severity on which points are
assessed) are actually written by the senators. We as a committee must
enforce the rules regardless of whether we personally think they are fair
or just. The fact remains that it is not within the jurisdiction of the
elections committee to determine how the rules should change. We are there
to enforce what the senate has determined as acceptable codes. I am
pleased to know that so many think these codes, most specifically the
system with which violation points are assessed, are unjust.  I now urge
you to voice these concerns to the people that can implement the changes
you seek...your senators.

Sincerely,
Sallie Boorman
}}}
   I love how she is taking no responsibility for the action.  It is completely at their discression how many points to assign to the violation. Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Its not just how many points to assign to the violation but whether it was a violation in the first place.  Like I said before, the Committees interpretation of those codes is not the only possible one or even the obvious one  the code isnt talking about all incomplete forms but only ones that are incomplete with the result that they become falsified, which Robs form was not, by the Committees own admission!  I just sent a letter to the Aggie making this point, hopefully theyll print it.  Users/KenjiYamada
       Excellent point Kenji.  While I tried to be somewhat neutral in my analysis, I just went through the code to see what it actually says at Government Code interpretation.  I honestly dont see how ones duty to faithfully follow the codes can cause someone to feel compelled to interpret them in a ridiculous way.  Some would call this intellectual dishonesty.

 Ryan Basilios Letter 
A former Elections Committee member, Ryan Basilio, gave his input on the controversy. {{{
To whom it may concern:
I have been very worried about the current situation that has happened
to senatorial candidate Rob Roy. Let me explain some things first. I
was in the elections committee during the fall of 2003 elections. During
those elections Mr. Kalen Gallagher and Ms. Paloma Perez were running
Student focuss campaign. The elections were running smoothly until the
first filing period for finance disclosure had passed and as the candidates
dropped off their disclosure forms FOCUS it seems had not received a
receipt that we needed to verify their spending. Attached is a document
that explains their case. They have stated in the document that they
did not produce a receipt and therefore could not verify their financial
records. Kalen actually drove down to Clairmont in southern California
to produce a receipt. Anyways the current chairperson for the committee
was on that same committee that allowed for the receipt to be produced
2 days after the disclosure deadline therefore violating the campaign
finance agreement. The Committee let this as a precedent to allow late
receipts.

So if my understanding is correct then the deal with Rob Roy not
producing receipts should not be an issue for disqualification until
the final financial statements by the candidates. Thank you for your
time and energy.

you can view the evidence please see this link : http://math.ucdavis.edu/~neustrom/scan.jpg scan.jpg

 Christine Schachters response to multiple people 
Mere hours before the results were to be announced, Christine Schachter let loose another email expressing her feelings on the subject.

Fri, 25 Feb 2005 08:35:18 (PST) {{{
   	Thank you for voicing your concern, as the Elections Committee has not
taken this issue lightly, nor did it in making its decision of
disqualifying Rob Roy.  However, whether or not you believe Rob Roy to be a
trustworthy and identifiable candidate, the fact remains that he failed to
turn any receipts with his expenditure form, placing him in violation of
government codes.  If you feel strongly about this issue, then the way to
make a difference is to talk to one of the ASUCD Senators, as they have the
power over writing and changing the codes; while it is our sole duty to
implement them.  Also, please take into account where you receive your
information from and make sure that you have all the facts straight.  If
you would like a copy of the government codes as to become better informed
about ASUCD and the Election, they can be found on the third floor of the
MU.  If you do feel this strongly, I urge you to apply for the Elections
Committee next year, and make the change you want to see happen.

  The more you read, the more it seems nobody on the Committee has actually read the Government code.  There simply is NO authority to disqualify someone on the basis of solely an incomplete form.  The Government code they cited provides only for falsification, and _at this point_, there is no evidence of this behavior. The committee has a history of inventing rules that do not exist.  Be sure to save these emails as evidence.  There can potentially be serious reprocutions for this, not limited to their positions on the committee.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
  I got that same email in reply from her so I dont know if she even read our emails.  Users/MarieHuynh
  make the change you want to see happen isnt that esstially a quote from the LEAD slogan? Users/DanMasiel

 The reversal 
The elections committee decided that they could not disqualify somebody after the first vote was cast, so they reversed themselves and announced their reversal when they announced the election results.

Rob Roy went on to be elected in the first round of vote counting, going over the threshold by 130 votes.  This was the first time since Choice Voting had been implemented that any candidate had won in the first round.

 The Aftermath 
Robs reinstatement brought some California Aggie Aggie attention, in the form of an editorial and some letters.  http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/03/01/Opinion/Editorial.Elections.Committee.Mishandled.Disqualification1319761.shtml?norewrite200607290310&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com The editorial concluded that Rob Roy should have been disqualified after the election, but the Elections Committees mistake made his getting a senate seat possible.

20050224 17:46:19 nbsp Question: tomorrow, when the judicial constitutional ammendment passes, who will have the power to rule on the results of this election Users/KenBloom

20050224 17:55:14 nbsp The IRS standard is that receipts be maintained for items over $25.  And unless explicitely required as an attachment, need only be retained for a specified number of years by the declarant. Ironic.Users/JaimeRaba

20050224 17:57:55 nbsp Someone check the instructions on the forms. (I dont remember, because I didnt spend any money when I ran) Users/KenBloom

20050224 18:00:35 nbsp Form instructions may not be legally sufficient to effect a disqualification.  Usually the standard is falsifacation.  And also there is perhaps some due process requirement here, too. Users/JaimeRaba
   Well, theres two ways about it: first is to find out whether he broke any rules at all by not giving reciepts (if reciepts werent included in the instructions, he didnt break any rules, game over. If they were, then he did and we move onto the next). the second is to argue that the penalty only applies to falsification (and not to accidental omission). This is the lawyer stuff. Furthermore, I think there may be utility in waiting a couple days until the ASUCD Court has enough power to sort out the mess, rather than the Elections Committee.  Users/KenBloom

20050224 18:02:10 nbsp (To some extent, Federal AND State election laws apply to even Student Govt elections at Universities.) Users/JaimeRaba

20050224 18:04:15 nbsp I think they only did this because they had a personal vendetta against members of the Friends Urging Campus Kindness Friends Slate, and therefore should be removed for acting in a biased manner. Users/BrentLaabs

20050224 18:11:26 nbsp Gabriel Bang had some kind of campaign expenditure form penalty as well. I think he didnt turn it in on time or it wasnt properly filled out. He was able to take office and was only given a few hours of community service in the CoHo as a penalty. Users/MikeSiminitus

20050224 18:16:52 nbsp I remember that there was a case involving UC Riverside and UC Irvine where the respective student governments had imposed mandatory spending limts, and the district court ruled this as unconstitutional under the standard set by the US Supremee Court in Buckley v. Valeo (1976).  I wonder if this was ever overruled?  This is significant because it couldby analogyextend other relevant law into this situation.  Let me know if there is further interest in this topic. Users/JaimeRaba

20050224 19:14:36 nbsp Additional details:  The elections committee called __all__ of the places Rob listed on his form and confirmed he listed the correct prices for all his items.  They know he wasnt lying, but they still deemed this severe enough to give him a 3 out of 3 possible violation points.  Total bullshit. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050224 18:54:48 nbsp can someone mention the specifics of what is on the expenditure form that doesnt have reciepts?  how much isnt accounted for? Users/RishiTrivedi
    He bought spraypaint, like 30 bucks worth of it, and didnt give them the reciepts for it.  Keep in mind that they personally verified that his prices were __correct__.

    Its going to be the frontpage story. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050224 19:29:27 nbsp It seems pretty clear to me that the article A quoted above says you cant submit an incomplete form with the result that your form is falsified, not just that you cant submit an incomplete form, period.  So in order for Robs incomplete form to even fall under that article, they would have to show that his form had been falsified, which according to this page they have explicitly denied.
