Dixie placed eighth at the 2006 Picnic Day frisbee dog contest.  I believe she was top local dog.
Dixie is much happier off leash and finds it easier to herd her cycling companion unbound.

The Doodle was euthanized at home on December 29. She was diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma less than three weeks earlier.
