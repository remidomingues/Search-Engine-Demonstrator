wiki:dixon Dixon offers much more than a few gas stations and a WalMart. You can get to Dixon from Davis by going west on Interstate 80 or by taking country roads such as Pedrick Road. Located in Solano County, it takes no longer to get from Davis to Dixon than it does to get to Woodland, and its cheaper to live in Dixon than in Davis. Many restaurants are located along wiki:dixon:Pitt School Road. The animals most associated with the town are lambs and sheep, hence the high school mascot: the rams. A lesser used name for Dixon is Ram Town, which can be seen on some of the local businesses. Davis and Dixon are separated by the DavisDixon Greenbelt.

20120921 07:15:53 nbsp So far the only good thing about living in SouthWest Davis is proximity to DIXON for shopping. For my car windshield, for the Goodwill on halfpricesale days, for WalMart and my $4.00 prescriptions, for the Safeway with a somewhat discounted price at its gas station, for churches that give out free food with no quibbling when youre a substitute teacher and off for the summer. If I could find a way to get cheaper rent on that side of the County Line than splitting a room in a multipleroommate apartment here right offcampus, Id do it in a New York Minute.
