Dixon Downs was a proposed horse racetrack and, in the second phase of development, hotel resort and retail plaza. It would have been located at the corner of Pedrick Road and Interstate 80 in Dixon. http://www.magnaent.com Magna Entertainment Corp. was in charge of the project, which encompassed 260 acres of land. It was approved by the Dixon city council on October 23, 2006, 6 years after it was first proposed. In late 2006, a group opposing the racetrack delivered 4 sets of petitions to the city to force the council to either rescind its decision or allow citizens to vote on the issue. The council decided on the latter and held a special election on April 17, 2007 for Measures M, N, O, and P. Shortly after, the city of Davis and Campbell Soup Company filed lawsuits against Dixon over concerns with the environmental impact report (EIR). As of April 18, all four Measures have failed, as shown by http://www.co.solano.ca.us/resources/RegistrarofVoters/Dixon%20Summary%20Results.htm county election results. Though Magna still owns the land, they have indicated that the project is dead; the property is currently for sale (reference: Davis Enterprise 20070820 article).
