The Dixon Lambtown is an annual festival celebrating the rich agriculture and lamb industry of the local region.  This year the festival will be held at the May Fair grounds on Saturday, July 30th, 2005. The festival offers a variety of craft and fiber booths, competitions, animal exhibits, workshops, music performances and, of course, lamb dishes.  Admission for this event is $1, which will automatically enter you in a raffle.  More information can be found at their website.


I really enjoyed it last year. I got a tshirt with a lamb on it and then I ate some lamb.  Users/PatrickVisperas
