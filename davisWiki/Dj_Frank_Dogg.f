Frank Dogg is a cool guy, hes really into the hiphop and dj scene here in davis.

He runs a recording studio, but i see him do more house parties. Get to know him, and you might get to be in his tv show.

Ive seen him spin at little prague and Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y. Uncle Vitos and I always see him in traffic in his frankdoggmobile van.

he also has a tv show on youtube at
