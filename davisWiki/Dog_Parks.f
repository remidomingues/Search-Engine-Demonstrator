Dog Parks are fencedoff areas in which dogs can be let off a leash and allowed to socialize with other dogs and people humans. It is beneficial for the dogs and can help teach them how to have positive interactions with other canines. Please make sure you understand http://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/15thingshumansdowrongatdogparks what not to do at dog parks.

 Caution  On Sunday morning Aug 2 2009, several cars parked at the Toad Hollow Dog park had windows smashed and purses stolen.  The thief was very quick as the vehicles were left unattended for less than 5 minutes.  Please take whatever steps are necessary to keep your belongings safe while at the dog parks.  users/jimstewart
