It is important to know how to choose a dog trainer because dog training is currently a divided profession.  There are many who continue to train dogs using compulsion based approach while others have move on to more humane methods such as clicker training.  Thus before deciding on a dog training school for your dog, it is best to understand for yourself, the differences between these training methods, assess for yourself which method you are more comfortable with and from there, make a decision on which school or dog trainer to approach.  This article gives a good insight on http://ezinearticles.com/?DogClickerTrainingvsCompulsionBasedDogTraining,WhichisBetter?&id5258083 the difference between the clicker and compulsion dog training.

Typically, a clicker trainer, when training a dog, employs predominantly positive reinforcement (e.g. Treats) and occasional negative punishment (e.g. time outs). Hence such methods have been termed as more humane and dog friendly. Conversely, the traditional compulsion based dog trainer relies heavily on positive punishment (e.g. physical corrections) and negative reinforcement (e.g. ear pinches, releasing of pressure on the choke chain etc.) to get the job done. Refer to this article on http://ezinearticles.com/?DogTrainingThe4QuadrantsofOperantConditioningWhatTheyAreandHowTheyAreUsed&id7188040 the 4 quadrants of operant conditioning to understand these methods better.



Lastly, nothing beats attending a dog training class without your dog to see if the owners and their dogs are having a good time. While there, take the opportunity to talk to the trainers and understand their training philosophy.
