20070816 23:43:18 nbsp The doggone walkathon is one of my favorite events because the animal lovers of davis all come together to celebrate their dogs, friends and support the SPCA in placing shelter animals. This is one of the biggest fundraisers for the SPCA.Local companies such as ACE Hardware, PetCo, and many others show their support in forms of donation and booths. There are contests such as best dog trick, musical sits(a crowd favorite,costume contest and off course the 2.5 mile walk) Great time to be with family come support the dog community of davis, who knows you may adopt a dog from the SPCA one day(greys anatomy pups featured this year all received homes who could resist a border collie pup) Thanks to all for continuing to help make this event a success.
