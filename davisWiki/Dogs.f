Dog owners may find Davis to be a welcoming yet sometimes frustrating place as the city tries to mediate the needs of dog owners with the desires of other community members. Over the past decade this has elicited volatile (some say lively) debate at City Council meetings and in letters to The Davis Enterprise. Newcomers to Davis should be aware that wiki:WikiPedia:Heartworm heartworm and fleas are problems in the area, and most dogs are on some sort of preventative medication; Foxtail foxtails and filaree are other fairly frequent problems for dogs that enjoy running through open fields. This page is intended to provide a home for dog owners and those who simply want to enjoy other peoples dogs on occasion. And please be kind to others... pick up after your pooch.


 Davis Dog Community 

See the http://www.davisdog.org Davis Dog Owners Group (DDOG) which maintains a list server for DDOG updates.

Also see the Pit Bulls Pit Bull entry for the specific issues for the breed, primarily perception by the public.

 The Past 
The http://communityservices.cityofdavis.org/ City of Davis Parks & Community Services Department developed a dog park on the westmost portion of the property known as Toad Hollow Dog Park Toad Hollow (Core Area Pond) on 2nd Street. The development of this area in spring 2005 came only after extensive community discussion and debate beginning as early as 1996, pitting Julie Partansky local environmentalists, soccer parents and some relatives of Davis Cemetery deceased Davisites against local dog owners. Additional recommendations arising from this process include revision of the Parks & Recreation Facilities master plan to include dog parks and dog run areas, exploration of Grasslands Park as a possible site for a dog park, and investigation of potential development of the old Yolo County Central Landfill city landfill site near Pole Line Road & Covell for a variety of park functions, including use as a dog park.

In September 2003 the Recreation & Park Commission unanimously voted to update the Parks & Recreation Facilities master plan to include: standards for dog run areas, standards for dog parks, proposed locations for dog parks and proposed locations for new dog run areas.


 The Future 
In August 2011, DDOG member Susan Bennett and her dog Ellie Mae were chosen as one team of 15 finalists in the Beneful Dream Dog Park Contest. The grand prize winner of this contest will win $500,000 toward developing their dream dog park. In this case, Sue and Ellie Mae want to put the money toward developing the 35 acre Bark Park at Grasslands Park on Mace Boulevard Mace Blvd., three miles south of Davis. Now that they have made it to Round 2 of the contest, the community is encouraged to register and http://wagworld.preview.arcww2.com/DreamDogPark/Finalists2011/Entry/Default.aspx?id181 vote daily until September 8. The public vote counts for 10 percent of the final score. The Beneful Dream Team will also judge the finalist entries, representing 90 percent of the final score to help select the grand prize winner. We need your votes!

In December 2003 the Davis City Council unanimously agreed to work with Yolo County on jointly developing a dog park at the countys Grasslands Park on Mace Boulevard Mace Blvd., three miles south of Davis. http://www.yolocounty.org/org/bos/agendas/2003/120903/33.pdf This agreement was in exchange for 33 acres acquired by the City of Davis as habitat mitigation for Mace Ranch  they pledged to provide parity for the estimated loss of land value by providing, among other things, $45,000$50,000 for a 35 acre Bark Park at the southwest corner of park. Included in this pledge by the city was provision for perimeter chain link fencing, entrance gates, a tenvehicle parking lot and water access. Additional Bark Park funding has already been provided through Proposition 12 and work was expected to begin by spring 2005.

A master plan for Toad Hollow Dog Park has been developed with community input summer 2006 and will be presented to the City Council for approval; additional information and updates can be found on the Toad Hollow Dog Park page.

 Restaurants with full wait service 

 From http://www.dogfriendly.com/server/newsletters/rest0706a.shtml DogFriendly.com: According to Susan Strong, a representative of the California Department of Health Services (CDHS), Food and Drug Branch, (pet) dogs are allowed throughout California at any outdoor dining areas unless they have to walk through the inside of a restaurant to get to the outdoor seats. It does not matter if food is served outside or taken out by the customer, or if the seats are located on a patio, sidewalk, or in a fenced area as long as there is access through an outside gate or opening. The California law is set by statute which was last updated in 1986. In addition, the California statute forbids counties or cities from making these codes stricter. Of course, it is still the prerogative of a restaurant owner to choose whether or not to allow dogs in their outdoor seating area, but the choice lies with the owner, not the city or county. Notwithstanding the state law, even in California, restaurants will sometimes cite local health codes in not allowing dogs at their outdoor seating areas. In some cases, the restaurant owner may be trying to shift the blame so that customers with dogs in tow will not be upset with the restaurant. In other cases, the local health inspector may be misapplying the interpretation of the California statute.

 Most places with outdoor seating tend to allow patrons to sit with or near to their dogs.  This is a list of places that welcome pedestrianfriendly dogs to share their outdoor seating with their owners.

This varies from complex to complex in town.  But its always worth asking if their complex allows Companion Animals, and what kind of proof they need that the animal is a Companion Animal.

 Hikes & Romps Outside Davis 
Most http://www.nps.gov/ national and http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id21305 state parks either do not allow dogs or restrict them to leashes in campgrounds. Despite the best efforts of the Sierra Club there are, however, some exceptions including beautiful hikes within a couple hours of Davis. As a general rule of thumb, both the http://www.blm.gov/ Bureau of Land Management and the http://www.fs.fed.us/ Forest Service better serve the needs of dogowning visitors than park services.  Another good source of information is http://www.dogfriendly.com/server/travel/guides/us/usstateCA.shtml DogFriendly.coms California Dog Travel Guide, which lists places to hike with your dog as well as places to stay, etc.  (The http://www.dogfriendly.com/server/travel/uscities/guides/w/cities/wonlinecityCALake_Tahoe.shtml Lake Tahoe section of the guide is particularly detailed).

This section lists some regional areas where you can hike with your dog, but please be sure to find out specific regulations... some restrictions apply, especially when local water sources are located within the area. Poison oak can be ubiquitous in lower elevations of California, and though your dog may not end up itching s/he can easily transfer the oils to you. You can help encourage the inclusion of dogs in our parks by ensuring that your puppy is wellmannered and packs out his poop.

Dogs are part of the suborder Caniformia (along with bears, sea lions and many others).  So enjoy your Californian Caniformian.

 Health Care 
See Veterinary Hospitals for a list of vets in the area, and Food Poisoning covers dog food as well as people food.

Note: If youve just adopted a mixed breed puppy/dog and it as yet has no papers from any agency identifying the breed, you may want to consider registering it by the least problematic breed in its genes, e.g. if you have a Pit Bulls Pit Bullsharpei mix, you might just want to register it as a sharpei mix at your first vet visit. That way, if you need to get insurance or a rental lease, youre less likely to be discriminated against based upon your dogs breed. Veterinarians today electronically register all dogs with the county once theyve been vaccinated against rabies. Letting your vet know how youd like your dogs breed identified can save you much grief down the road.

 Vaccination/Spay Clinics 
Yolo County does not offer low cost spay/neuter clinics to the general public, but http://www.sspca.org Sacramento SPCA may be willing to extend its low cost spay/neuter services to Yolo County residents depending upon current demand from their constituency. If you have a Pit Bulls Pit Bull or Pitmix there is a free spay/neuter program (this is also offered in other counties). For a recording of current Sacramento area low cost spay/neuter clinics, contact Sacramento Area Animal Coalition 916.808.SPAY.

 This is the only first aid book youll probably ever need for your dog. While it definitely doesnt replace an emergency visit to the vet, it will get you to the point where you can decide if something is lifethreatening or not. Its also an exceptionally easy to read book despite its thickness and content. Should you pick up this book, and can remember only one thing, learn how to identify when your dog is going into shock and how to treat until you can get emergency care.
