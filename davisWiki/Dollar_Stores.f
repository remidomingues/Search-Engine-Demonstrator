These stores have found a major marketing niche. They even have their own trade shows. Some, like the 99 Cent Only Store sell absolutely everything for 99 cents or a submultiple (2/$.99, 3/$.99, etc.). Other stores bend the rules to be many things for only $1 (this defeats the point, and these stores do not seem to be nearly as successful). Some things, like drinks, can be had for less than half the price of anywhere else (i.e. Sobes 2/$.99). Other items (a can of beans) are no cheaper than a Food 4 Less discount supermarket. Some stores have mostly party items and other nonessentials, but some have useful staples (i.e. food).

20051128 21:58:17 If you are wondering why they wouldnt work here, its because Davisites are not as price conscious, and want upscale products over inexpensive products. Also, rent is much higher here. This is why Cost Plus World Market can work. An upscale store like Trader Joes should do fine. Users/SteveDavison

20051223 11:37:22 nbsp Yeah, so much for Dollar stores not working in Davis.  See http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2005/10/07/news/085new3.txt this Enterprise Article.  I personally think Trader Joes would work here.  And I know TJs likes big interscetions, but Davisites would go out of their way to go to TJs.  Its just the perfect fit. Users/JaimeRaba

20051229 08:31:14 nbsp I go to the Dollar Tree in Woodland occasionally to get cheap candles, tupperware, sponges, kleenix, plastic baggies, and candy.  Probably not worth the drive alone, but when Im already there, I stop in.  Id definitely go to a Dollar Store in Davis if they had one. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060523 14:38:27 nbsp I heard there is supposed to be a Dollar Store coming to davis thats going to be where the old Ralphs used to be. Anyone know about this? Users/MyaBrn
   See the Dollar Tree dollar tree wiki page for more info.  Users/AlexPomeranz
   It helps to read doesnt it? Users/MyaBrn

20060523 14:51:26 nbsp As an added note, I disagree with SteveDavisons assertion that a dollar store wouldnt work in Davis.  Students here are generally _very_ price conscious, and last time I checked, Davis has a lot of students. :) Users/AlexPomeranz
