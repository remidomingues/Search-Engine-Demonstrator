In addition to the Town Flora flora of Davis, it is also home to a variety of creatures of a more mobile nature, our town fauna.  Some are wild, and can be found in the Town Wildlife entry, while some are much more domesticated in nature.  Some of these domesticated animals are pets and have individual profiles listed at Wiki Animals.  Note that some are also found in the wild, such as turkeys.

See also What Species Is This What Species Is This?; a fun and educational page about living things in Davis.

You can purchase many domesticated animals from local Pet Stores, while ones that fall more into the livestock category and need a farms farm can be found in the outskirts and on Craigslist.
