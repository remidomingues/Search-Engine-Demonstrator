Dominos Pizza is the second largest pizza chain in the United States.  The local store is on the same street as Sutter Hospital, and occupies part of the space that was once the West Davis Quiznos.

This particular Dominoes is now family owned and operated, and they are one of ONLY 72 locations out of 8000 that qualified to be a {{{Five Star location}}} due to rigorous corporate scrutiny on a number of levels. Among Franchisees its a very coveted award. This store is a franchise. It is owned by a local owner, but the owner pays Dominos to use the Dominos name.

The current location opened up in February, 2008, and is the second Dominos in town.  There was a departed businesses previous store on L Street where Pizza Guys is located.

Dominos Pizza closed at this location in midSeptember 2008, and reopened December 28th under new management.

Dominos offers one of the cheapest ways to order pizza in massive amounts.  Offers like the nowdefunct 555 deal and the 777 deal have been replaced with the $5.55 deal where you can order pizza, oven baked sandwich, or pasta bowls for $5.55 each. It is very likely that Dominos will represent one of the best pizzaperdollar ratios in Davis. There is also a File(Our New Look.pdf) nice coupon.

They sell chicken wings in several varieties (Hot, BBQ, Mango Habanero, or Plain). It is $5.99 for an 8 piece order and $9.99 for a 14 piece order.  They dont have a lot of sauce and are quite greasy. Consider sticking to the pizza if you dont like this.

Dominos Corporate has been going through great lengths to gain new customers and keep their current customers. As a result there are a lot of commercials as of late and they have come out with many new products. Some of these new products include Stuffed Cheesy Bread in three different flavors. These flavors include Plain Cheese, Spinich & Feta Cheese and Bacon and Jalapeno. They also now sell Parmasan Bites, which are small pieces of bread coverd in parmasan and garlic sauce (The same kind they put on the crust of the pizza).

Online ordering is available.

20090525 14:49:40 nbsp The new owners seem to really care about the customers and want everyone to have a good experience! I gave them a wiki primer and hopefully they will make an appearance... Users/StevenDaubert

20100117 23:12:35 nbsp The new pizza recipe that theyre using is delicious! Users/TheShah

20100131 17:27:27 nbsp I like the new pizza recipe, although I think the garlic salt they use on the crust is put a little on the heavy side. I told them that and the first thing they did was offer me two free pizzas (I ordered 2) w/o the garlic salt. They seem eager to please and that is something I appreciate very much from a business, especially from a large chain restaurant. Well done Davis Dominoes. Users/metalhead15

20100131 19:50:06 nbsp My wife and I decided to try out the new recipe tonight.  In short, its decent, not great.  For the tl;dr version, skip to the bottom of the review.  We ordered 2 medium 2topping pizzas, and an order of buffalo hot wings.  The online ordering system on which you build your own pizza is extremely easy to use.  Its a very simple stepbystep process with everything very clearly laid out.  We got one Hawaiian and one chicken and roasted red pepper pizza, with a BBQ sauce on the latter.

The pizza was decently good.  The new crust is extremely butteryId even say too much so.  Some bites tasted almost like move popcorn, with the butter flavor vying for the spotlight with the sauce, cheese, and toppings.  For the most part, it wasnt all that bad.  Im not sure why it varied from bite to bite.  Like metalhead, we also found it to be quite garlicky, but we both liked it.  What Im not sure I like is the texture.  I believe its garlic and butter mixed in with the corn meal they use to keep the cooked dough from sticking to the pan.  Unfortunately, all that butter makes it all stick to the dough.  I think it would be far better baked into the crust.  The bread of the crust was pretty good.

The sauce didnt particularly stand out, which Id say is a good thing.  It was sweet, decently flavorful, and went well with the Hawaiian.  No complaints there.  The BBQ sauce on the chicken & roasted peppers pizza was decent.  The flavor was nice, although it was a little thin.

The toppings were just OK.  The pineapple was the normal canned chunk pineapple that every pizza joint uses.  The ham was in tiny little wedges which were a little dried out, but certainly not inedible.  There was decent coverage of both.  On the other pizza, the chicken was pretty tasty, and there was plenty of it.  The roasted peppers, on the other hand, were a little vinegary and only covered half of the pizza (Ill post pics later on).  As a big fan of bell peppers cooked in just about any way, I was unimpressed.  Theyd do a lot better without the vinegar and charring them a little bit before slicing for some more flavor.

The new cheese was also just fine.  I would guess that its a lower fat mozzarella, since when melted it wasnt quite as stringy, and seemed to set up and tear (as opposed to stretching) at a higher temp than most pizza cheese.  I wouldnt call this a bad thing, though.  Even (especially?) when eating pizza, it doesnt hurt to cut a bit of fat.  It didnt detract from the flavor at all, and wasnt a big deal aesthetically.

The wings... well, the wings were pretty blah.  For starters, they werent very well sauced.  They obviously laid out the wings in two rows on a piece of aluminum foil, dumped an ounce of sauce over them, and folded the foil in half in hopes of coating them a bit.  Their hopes were dashed; less than half of each wing had any sauce on it, and there wasnt enough sauce in the foil to improve the situation.  The wings themselves were pretty greasy, and there wasnt much in the way of a breading or flour coating.  The wings come with a small container of dipping sauce  either ranch or bleu cheese  which isnt enough if you like very much on your wings.  Fortunately, we both prefer hot wings plain, so we didnt even open it.

All told the order came to a little under $21 with tax: $5.99 each for the pizzas, $5.99 for a 10piece hot wings, and tax.  Delivery would have been another $1.99, but I live quite close to the store so I just picked it up.  I would rate the pizzas as follows:

  Crust: 5/10 (too buttery; garlic/cornmeal gives it an unpleasant texture)
  Sauce: 7/10 (complemented the Hawaiian pretty well; not rating the BBQ here, but it was perfectly decent)
  Cheese: 7/10 (pretty good)
  Toppings
   Hawaiian: 6/10 (ham could be larger pieces, less dried out)
   Chicken & Roasted Pepper: 4/10 (chicken was good, peppers sucked and were sparse)
  Wings: 4/10 (greasy, not enough sauce)
  Price: 8/10 (drop the crappy wings and replace the crappy peppers with something else and it wouldve been pretty solid pizza for about $13/2x med)

20100725 01:08:30 nbsp Once it comes to making pizza, Jose is the best there is.  Users/HarpreetChima

20100725 01:08:48 nbsp If you ever order online and it says Jose is making your meal, youre in for a treat. Joses never disappointed us! Keep up the great work, man. Users/AnhthuDo

20100725 09:23:04 nbsp I really like this place  especially when Jose makes our pizza.  The other day we ordered a pizza and it took a while to get here (~45 mins.) The delivery guy apologized and gave us a coupon for a free side which is pretty cool.  If I want cheap (and good) pizza, I order it from here.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20100725 12:47:18 nbsp The new Pasta Bowls are to die for.  And ordering online is a breeze.  I used to hate Dominoes but the Davis location has since redeemed the company for me. Users/WesP


20100831 16:07:56 nbsp I called to order a pizza from dominos and the guy on the phone was extremely rude. From the first moment the guy answered the phone, his tone implied that he didnt want to be there and he was an a$$ on the phone. I asked him a question about any specials for a large pizza, there were silence on the other end.  I asked him the question again, still silence.  So I waited thinking he was looking it up, then the jack a$$ said are you still there I replied with yes and asked him the question the third time around. He gives me pricing for a small pizza, I asked him pricing specials for large pizza (my original question).  I had a enough on this nonsense and his attitude, so I terminated my order and went to Little Ceasers pizza.  Ive worked in customer service before and expect to receive the same common courtesy and decent customer service, in which I didnt get there today. Why should I support a business that have bad customer service.  Whoever is the manager should screen for better employees during hiring process youll probably maintain your customers longer. Users/kikao

20101001 18:45:39 nbsp The Dominos Pizza in Davis is quite simply superb.  Though I havent had him make one for me recently, Jose makes an awesome pizza, so if you see him making your order, be ready for a delicious treat.  I always get the 2medium 2topping pizzas for $5.99 each, both with bbq sauce and chicken, with light cheese.  The other topping is a grabbag.  Delicious. Users/KurtSassenrath

20101001 18:49:48 nbsp People keep talking about how great Jose is.  What does he do to pizzas that other Dominos employees (here or elsewhere) dont do? Users/TomGarberson You must order online to experience his magic.

20110205 13:54:53 nbsp Ordered from here last night, after we were originally were going to get Woodstocks, however the guy who we talked to at Woodstocks was both very rude and hung up on us.  We decided not to call back and gave our business to Dominos instead.  Great Pizza, for an amazing price and super fast delivery! Users/daniebananie1001

20110312 20:24:12 nbsp They are not stingy on toppings, and delivery is reliable and quick.  Users/ChickenNuggets

20110318 20:04:38 nbsp Ordered online and got Jose.  My pizza was delivered promptly and was fantastic!  Great value.  I will order here over village bakery and woodstocks from now on. Users/miguelsantiago

20110318 20:10:05 nbsp Last pizza ordered was burnt and barely edible. Next time I am taking a picture and sending it to corporate. Users/WesP

20110622 00:06:24 nbsp Great place, but be careful of ordering close to closing time (11:00). I had a guy who told me at 10:55 that the wait time was an hour and a half due to long lines so i did not order, yet forty five minutes later the entire shop was closed and dark as night. Seems like they gave fake waiting times to get out early Users/JohnathonJosephs

20110804 15:14:11 nbsp This place was really cool back in the 80s.  They let School field trips come in, and make your own pizza... very cool, unique thing for a kid back then. Users/OldDavis73

20110916 06:08:24 nbsp Just to clear up a few things. I work at Dominos and do a lot of their online stuff for them. So as far as the owners making an appearance on Davis Wiki it is unlikely (but not impossible), but they do sincerely care about their customers and want everyone to have a good experience with Dominos. As far as giving fake wait times near closing that is not true. If they give you a later wait time when it is close to closing it is most likely because they have much of their product put away because it is so close to closing. So they have to pull out a lot of extra toppings from the walkin to make your pizza this late at night. It probably wont take quite that long to get your pizza (probably more like 45 minutes) they may say that time just to be safe. They may get several late night orders and this could cause your wait time to be long. As far as the mysterious Jose this is either refering to the former G.M. whos name is Jose or the owner whos name is also Jose. In either case both of these guys have had years of experience with Dominos and that is why your pizzas taste so amazing when you see his name on your order. Users/jlc1988

20111108 21:27:45 nbsp jlc1988 I dont know why you call Jose mysterious.  It literally says Jose when it tells you who is making your pizza.  In fact, instead of mysterious, he should be legendary.  While other pizzas from this store are good, the couple pizzas Ive received from Jose were especially fantastic. Users/miguelsantiago

20111115 17:47:49 nbsp AUTHENTICO ITALIANO!!!!!  this is the BEST PIZZA PARLOR IN DAVIS!!!! The fat Italian guy who owns it reminds me of Marlon Brando. Users/KCSlater

20111117 22:19:43 nbsp TERRIBLE SERVICE. pizza okay. first time ordering and the guy on the phone was super rude. I ordered anyways to try the pizza. pizza was decent, but not enough to cover up that guys bad attitude. I would not recommend ordering here.  Users/AmandaYammamoto

20111130 18:59:54 nbsp I just ordered online and had Zachary make my pizza.  I was surprised to watch my pizza reach the quality check after baking, and then go back in the oven (or maybe a new pizza went in?).  The pizza that made it to my door was superb. Users/miguelsantiago

20111202 17:57:49 nbsp I called him Mysterious because there is no way of telling which Jose you are talking about. Im sure you still dont know. Hence the mystery. As far as it saying who is making your pizza it may not actually be that person who is making your pizza. It just lists the manager in charge, someone else probably made your order but Zachary is a cool guy. Users/jlc1988

20120122 19:34:30 nbsp Just ordered some pizza, and Jose is making it! I can tell already its going to be good!! Users/Vero

20120123 10:37:41 nbsp Service and quality have dropped significantly since my last order. Most importantly, when delivering an order it is up to the driver to remember ALL the items ordered for the delivery. Be a few minutes late? Fine, understandable depending on business level. Cant draw anything on the box (yes, an odd but fun request) because Our corporate doesnt want us to waste time or have fun? Fine, understandable, not everyone likes dinosaurs.

Where I draw the line is when you show up to deliver an order which is incomplete, demand full payment since you cannot adjust the cost onsite, and then still have the audacity to expect a tip and verbalize as much.

I took a week of time to ponder whether to complain here or not, didnt want to rush in charged with emotion, but I can say for certain after dealing with your company on this most recent order that it will be my last. Users/WesP
 Id have to agree, the pizza is definitely not what it used to be. I have found that the crust and pizza in general is not even half as tasty. Users/JamesKrause

20130825 01:37:50 nbsp TERRIBLE customer service. I had a problem with my order and the girl hung up on me >:( Users/MasonAmpol

20130826 00:27:32 nbsp Love it or hate it, its Dominos pizza.  On the rare occasion my pie was incorrect the store promptly sent out a replacement pizza.  Have never had a bad experience with this store. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20140109 14:56:37 nbsp People who complain about dominos should really chill. Its cheap, fast, and good for the price.

I work there and can offer some advice.

We are open for delivery until 1am SundayThursday, and 2am Friday and Saturday night.
If you are ordering during our rush hours, which are usually 5pm10pm, expect a longer wait. Its a college town and we are the only dominos in davis, so we are very busy at this time. Go ahead and call and complain, we will do our best to get your pizza out there as fast as we can during those hours.

The delivery fee is 2.99 now but that is not a tip. Drivers get 1.50 per order we take, this covers gas and car maintenance but tips make or break drivers nights. Even if it is only 2 or 3 extra bucks, we appreciate it very much and we do remember good tippers and bad tippers. We are good at recognizing addresses that tip well or bad, so give us a reason to do 10mph over the speed limit instrad of taking our time and not risking a speeding ticket next time :)

The best items imo are the stuffed cheesey bread and the thin crust pizzas.
If you order garlic parm sauce (white sauce) on your pizza, ask for light sauce because it gets nasty when even the normal amount is put on.
Lava cakes are great and the pasta bowls are okay too.

 Users/KVasquez

20140703 15:49:32 nbsp Ordered two medium twotopping pizzas on a Saturday night through one of the coupon dealies from the website, total was $12.94. While its a little creepy that the website not only lets you track the process of the pizza as its asssembled but also gives you the employees name whos working on your pizza, the online pizza helicoptering provided amusement and joy for hungry people as they eagerly followed michael (if I recall at all) and his pizza progress bar.

The boxes were ready for carryout within fifteen minutes. Within, the pizza: Hot, gooey, fragrant, lavishly topped with pepperoni and olives, and bacon and pineapple, both on thin crusts. The sauce was a bit thin, but nobody minded because it didnt oversoggy the thin crusts. The pizzas were demolished, to praise and acclaim.

Dominos is great for immediate pizza cravings. I hope working there is comfortable, though; it looked like there were six dudes all bustling around the kitchen area when I went to pick up pizza (though that may simply be a quality of Saturday nights). All I want in life is pizza, and for the people who make it to be happy.  Users/JaniceW
