20101103 16:52:43 nbsp Rocky Domms saved my marriage!  The story goes like this, one day my husband announces that he thinks he chipped a tooth then 56 months later I find out that the chip meant 1/2 of a moler was missing! I strongly encouraged a visit to the dentist immediately which he does and it lands him with a SAME DAY appointment with Rocky Domms.  Since having a root canal, my husband has been a joy to live... needless to say that he was a bit cranky before but now I understand the amount of pain he had been tolerating! My husband said that Rocky was excellent! Highly recommend Rocky Domms. Users/SuzanneKimmel

I am grateful for the  professionalism, the friendly faces, the competency of Dr. Doms, and the respect with which I was treated. Thank you!  Users/LisaBaxter

20110123 09:14:04 nbsp Dr. Rocky is very, very good.  He was very accommodating with his schedule, informative about the work and did a great job.  The discomfort level was not significantly greater than a filling.   Users/JimStewart

20110311 15:59:50 nbsp 20110223 Dr. Doms has taken the fear out of root canals!   He has the latest equipment,excellent technique and a calming manner.

20110425 16:32:58 nbsp A classy, superprofessional and caring operation from the time you walk until the time you leave.   Highly recommended. Users/PeterSchiffman

20110628 23:31:06 nbsp Dr. Doms is an exceptional endodontist, whom I highly recommend to all, no matter the degree of your endodontic/root canal issue(s). After a failed root canal procedure two weeks ago (performed by a different outoftown endodontist), Dr. Doms excellent office staff promptly responded to calls from my local dentist and scheduled a sameday consult and diagnostic appointment, followed by the restorative procedure, performed by Dr. Doms the very next day. During the procedure (unbelievably, completely painless and so much less stressful than I could have possibly imagined), Dr. Doms detected an additional root canal in my tooth that had not been seen nor treated by the first endodontist. His stateoftheart technology, including digital radiography and surgical microscope/magnification technology, provided for the highest level of treatment available, which resulted in my successful treatment.

He has remained in frequent contact with my general dentist, Dr. Dagon Jones, (also highly recommended) and is very responsive to questions and/or concerns. He patiently explains expected treatment outcomes as well as available options given your individual case. Nancy and Michelle, Dr. Doms office endodontic specialists, are also highly knowledgeable, responsive, friendly and efficient in explaining everything related to the treatment. I was able to preregister online and their software even allows for text message appointment reminders, etc. if that is your preference.

Dr. Doms UCSF, UC Davis and Temple education + residency, his prior experience, technology  as well as his established professional relationships with the top local and greater Sacramento/Bay Area dentists, oral surgeons, periodontists et. al.  make him the best endodontist in Davis in my opinion. I will recommend his practice to friends, family and to anyone else that seeks the best leadingedge treatment available in our area. Users/LynetteEcklund

20110815 20:15:00nbspExceptional practice!! I walked on the door in pain, after getting my appointment in 2 hrs. I had major problems with a crown, treatment of this tooth started 30 years ago and a lot of bad experiences left it in a pretty bad shape. It has been treated on 3 continents, so far. With Dr. Doms help this tooth may live enough to see a couple more. High tech equipment and low tech explanations complement for an educational visit. I hope you never have problems with your root canals, but do not worry if you do. Dr. Doms is here to resolve any problem you may have.  Users/MariusSS

20120404 10:39:35 nbsp I will add to the glowing reviews here. My roots for one of my molars were infected, and I had issues chewing on that particular side. Dr Doms had a perfectly calm and professional demeanor about him, and explained (without being condescending) every step during the process. The process itself was so quick, that before I knew it, the root canal was done! Completely painfree too.

It was my very first (and hopefully last) root canal, and I honestly couldnt have had a better experience. Definitely took the pain (and fear) out of root canals. I would highly recommend anyone to his office for the very friendly staff and excellent quality of Dr Doms work.

20121218 16:29:21 nbsp I would highly recommend Dr. Doms and his staff to anyone who is worried about going through a root canal. I walked in for my first root canal operation ever, feeling uneasy not knowing what to expect, but Dr. Doms was very thorough and sincere in explaining the process and answering any questions before going into the actual operation. By the time he started, I felt comfortable leaving my tooth in the care of Dr. Doms.
Most importantly, it was painless, which was the biggest worry. I couldnt be more thankful! Users/AngelaW

20130228 17:26:13 nbsp Rocky rides a bicycle and lives in Davis.  Why is this important?  Because he realizes how much cyclists dread tooth pain!  Seriously though, Rocky Domms made a sincere effort to help me feel comfortable (dentist phobia over here), and he paid special attention to how I was feeling during the procedure.  Thanks Rocky.  I shall fear no longer.   Users/davekemp
