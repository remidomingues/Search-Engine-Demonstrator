Dons Diner is a Woodland Restaurants restaurant in Woodland that serves classic diner food. It doesnt look like much from the outside, but Dons is great. Breakfast is delicious and served all day, but they stop serving waffles at 11:00am.

20081102 01:04:15 nbsp This place was great. We went with a group of about 15 UCD students for a Saturday morning breakfast.  We had pretty much everything you can eat on the menu and it all tasted great.  The Hobo Scramble was by far the best, coming @ a close second was the french toast sandwich. I suggest getting going with someone else and sharing the two meals, maybe with a side of hash browns or something...really makes it a solid and pleasing meal. ;) (Roz)  Service was great...there were freaky knives, rapiers, blades and swords hanging along the walls (dont really know why either...)

Question is whos Don?  And why is there a Bobs Liquor right next to this place.   And are they friends?....or enemies.

All in all, cool place.  Prices were about $8$12 for normal meals. Users/Dyavrom
