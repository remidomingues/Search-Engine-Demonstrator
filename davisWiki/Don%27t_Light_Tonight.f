Dont Light Tonight is a program of the YoloSolano Air Quality Management District.  It is a voluntary program active between November 1 and February 28 each winter in which residents are asked to not burn wood on days on which higher levels of fine particulate pollution are forecast. Several weather conditions, including a lack of wind and dry spells, can cause air pollution to be trapped where we breathe, causing higher concentrations of fine particulates. Particulate pollution is associated with health impacts. Children and the elderly are especially sensitive to air pollution.

In 201213, the City of Davis ran Wood Burning Ban a pilot program making compliance on low air quality days mandatory with some exceptions.  It used the same standard as the YoloSolano AQMDs voluntary program (25 micrograms per cubic meter).
