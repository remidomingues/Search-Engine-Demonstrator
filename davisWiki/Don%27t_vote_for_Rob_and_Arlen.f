 Rather lengthy, but not verbose, magniloquent, or overly wordy (which we are told does not require a hyphen) candidate statement 

Don’t vote for us. You should vote for Kareem Salem and Julie Hooper instead. The two of us are fifth years and we have put in the effort to be on the ballot because we have been involved in the campus for a long time and want to leave it in good hands when we leave.

Rob Roy is an English major and former ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senator and Users/ArlenAbraham Arlen Abraham is Food Science & Technology Beer major and a former The California Aggie Aggie Editorial Board member. After holding open interviews, we have chosen to endorse the following senate candidates:

Ivan Carrillo, Michael Lay, Christine Pham, Fazila Malik, Albert Parnell, and Pete Markevich.

These candidates, we believe, want to serve as senators in order to improve student life and are not simply running to enhance their resumes.

Here is a list of things that we would like to see done by ASUCD or the UC Davis University and feel that Salem and Hooper are the Executive candidates that have the knowhow and will to accomplish:

Make Classical Notes free and available in online in PDF form (put advertisements on the website in order to pay for the service). Stop publishing the UCD Student Directory Student Directory (it is largely inaccurate and waste of paper). Students who print less than the allotted 60 sheets in UC Davis Computer Labs campus computer labs should be allowed to have these sheets rollover to the next quarter, or transfer them to a friend.

Make every new building on campus a wiki:WikiPedia:Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design LEED Platinum certified building. When renovating the ASUCD Coffee House CoHo install an large number of electrical outlets so people can charge their laptops, integrate solar panels on the roof, and also install water spout gargoyles (cause UCD should look more like wiki:WikiPedia:Hogwarts Hogwarts). Start an iPod/cell phone charging service out of Aggie Student Store. Need your iPod charged? Stick it in the UCD Alphabet Soup ASS.

Improve SISWEB and Geckomail, increase storage capacity, and until then we encourage students to forward their mail to Gmail (you can still send email with an @ucdavis.edu).

Stop greedy lecturers like Liz Applegate from scamming students – $75 for a nonreturnable textbook is unacceptable. There are better ways to prevent plagiarism than requiring an assignment to be turned in on original forms. If Applegate insists on original forms, she should have a workbook and a returnable text book.

There should be more coordination between student representatives to Academic Senate committees, so that more students know what’s going on among the people who actually run things.

Hire a permanent adviser for ASUCD Entertainment Council Entertainment Council so they don’t have to start from square one every year. Also, since the Activities and Recreation Center ARC was paid for with Undergraduate Student Fees student fees the EC should be able to easily use the ARC Ballroom without hassle. ARC public events manager mailto:rlmiller@ucdavis.edu Rebcecca Miller has denied EC use of the Ballroom on several occasions, stating even that the ballroom is not fit for dancing. WTF, mate?

Kareem Salem and Julie Hooper have genuine campaign promises that they can actually accomplish. The other guys have a history of making promises they dont keep and are just horny for power. The two us are just horny for making UC Davis a better place, trust us, and http://elections.ucdavis.edu vote accordingly.


20070206 10:45:38 nbsp Reading this page, Im getting flashbacks of Rob repeatedly saying during senate meetings Theres the letter of the law and theres the spirit of the law.  Rob, doesnt this seem to be going a little overboard?  You used to argue for the spirit of the law over the letter of the law.  Youre not running for anything, but youre using ASUCD funds for newspaper space and flyers to promote your endorsements?  All because you collected sufficient signatures?  I dont have a dog in this fight, but I wish you were running for real a genuine third option for the executive ticket is always a good thing.  I know youve got good intentions, but Im not too keen on the approach. Users/ThomasLloyd

20070206 19:28:40 nbsp Thomas, Ive always been known as someone who never knows when to walk away from a fight. Arlen and I are having fun with a cause we believe in. Anyone can run for office so long as they get the signatures. Im reminding people of the greatness of democracy (and choice voting). Also, having been in the trenches Im just trying to get my ideas for the ASDUCD War plan documented and popularized. Im glad that youre still distracted by ASUCD despite all the wonders of Boalt  lord knows I would be, because I cant get enough. Users/RobRoy
  Raise your hand if you like democracy!

20070206 21:23:06 nbsp overly wordy is a compound modifier but it doesnt require a hyphen because overly specifically tells the reader what word its modifying (wordy). In fact, using a hyphen would make it grammatically incorrect. Users/AmyZimmerman

20070222 01:26:42 nbsp If I went to UCD this is the ticket I would vote for Users/StevenDaubert

20070222 05:46:48 nbsp I really really really miss having Rob at the senate table Users/GennaCarnes
