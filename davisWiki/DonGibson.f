20090129 00:14:48 nbsp I am likely going with the micro/fermentation option  Users/DonGibson

20090129 15:50:03 nbsp Good choice <.<   Id highly recommend taking Mic155L your senior year.  Singer only teaches it once a year to ~20ish people, and everyone who wants in needs to apply (fill out a quick info sheet) in advance.  If too many people apply, they tend to prioritize Micro majors over Biotech majors  dont let them.  Its a heavy micro workload, but its a real useful class.   Users/EdWins ES
