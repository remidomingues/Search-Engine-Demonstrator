 Yolo County Board of Supervisors 

On 20091002, Don held http://www.donsaylor.org/events/YoloFestInvite.pdf Yolo Fest, a kickoff fund raiser for his bid to run for Yolo County supervisor in 2010. Don was elected County Supervisor in the 2010 City Council Election 2010 Election and so will only serve 2 1/2 years out of 4 years of his City Council seat.

This has caused some controversy about when he should resign and how his successor is to be chosen.  If he were to resign early, a new election could be held for him at the same time as the regular 2010 November election. However, he has said that he owes it to the voters who elected him to stay until January 2011, when he will resign to become County Supervisor. This leaves the remaining Council with two choices to replace him: 1) hold a special election, at an estimated cost of $300,000 when the city budget is already strained or 2) select a successor, which some (e.g., Sue Greenwald) see as undemocratic. Letters to the editor of the The Davis Enterprise suggest that many are unhappy with Saylors decision not to resign early, although of course there are some who support the decision. This may have something to do with Saylor receiving only 3442 out of 5343 votes , or 64% (http://www.davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id3491:vanguardanalysissaylorskatesinunopposedbutwithrelativelylowpercentageofsupport&catid57:citycouncil&Itemid80 as estimated by the Vanguard), even though he was running unopposed.

 Positions on controversial issues 
  Halema Buzayan case: He was quoted in an http://www.davisenterprise.com/archive_pdfs/2008/20080525/pdfs/C5.pdf opinion column in the Davis Enterprise as saying Every specific (police misconduct) case that has been raised has been shown to be without merit. ... We have yet to see any of the flagrant abuses that have been described. In fact, every time we look they are not there.
  Measure J debate: Saylor has said he supports the concept behind Measure J but thinks it should undergo a thorough review before being reestablished.
