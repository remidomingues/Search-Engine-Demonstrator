20101005 08:31:53 nbsp Ive been going to Doc Wilson for 12 years now.  He always does a thorough job.  I never feel rushed.  I also feel better when I walk out the door than I did when I walkled in.  He has a special deal if you pay for ten visits ahead of time. Users/jbelenis

20120806 10:15:36 nbsp Dr. Wilson is a miracle worker!  I was in so much pain and he rubbed and cracked me into shape.  His banter is funny too!  Youll love his home office, such a beautiful place. Users/MaureenHoffmann

20121210 12:37:15 nbsp This guy knows how to help you feel better!  For three months my neck felt stiff and tight and painful, probably due to too much data entry and stresses related to increased demands at work.  Dr. Wilson is a good listener and a good teacher/healer. He has helped me understand the relationship between the bones, nerves and muscles in the spine, and then gently and effectively began helping me work things out.  I felt better after the very first treatment, and now after just 3 treatments, I am pain free. I can drive and look over my shoulder easily again.  My sleep has been restored.  Unbelievable, really, how quickly his treatments have worked.  He has VERY reasonable rates, and a flexible schedule.  Do you have pain and stiffness?  Are you ready to feel better?  Give him a call.
