 Vision 
The Davis Wiki project is a community, nonprofit effort to compile the undefined elements of everything Davis.  Everyone can contribute and edit content  it is no one person or groups site.  With this in mind, we intend to keep Davis Wiki completely free and, equally importantly, free from banner ads and other advertising.  Forever.  The only page that will ever mention our generous sponsors by name is this page.

 Costs 
Regardless of intentions, running a web site is not a free enterprise.  So we ask  if you enjoy the site and want to help keep it running for as long as possible  that you make a contribution.

We are an educational and charitable 501(c)3 organization. This means your contributions are tax deductible.

Donate online with PayPal using your Credit/Debit card or your PayPal account:

Please indicate if youd like a receipt for tax purposes! If youd like to deduct the contribution from your taxes youll want a receipt.

If you donate via check, please send an email to MailTo(daviswiki AT gmail DOT com) to let us know so we can keep track of donations as they come in.  If you dont want to be thanked publicly or have any other special instructions, please say so in your email.  Please indicate if youd like a receipt for tax purposes!
