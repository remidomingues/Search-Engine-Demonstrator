So youve spent the whole of your life in the pursuit of science, why not spend the first portion death after your life in the pursuit of science as well? The http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/cellbio/donatedbodyprogram/ Donated Body Program is run by the Department of Cell Biology and Human Anatomy at the UCDMC.

As you consider the option of donating your body to science, know that the need is great, and that your gift will be valued and honored. Your donation will play a critical role in helping medical students to master the complex anatomy of the human body and will provide researchers with the essential tools to help our patients of tomorrow.

http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/UCDWebCatalog/programs/Med/CHA.html Gross anatomy classes like CHA 101 are held in north west wing of Haring Hall. During Winter quarter when the labs are being held, you can smell formaldehyde as you walk past. Creepy! The cadavers dissected presumably come from the donated body program.
