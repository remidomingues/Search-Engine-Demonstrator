Hi,

Winters Jr Warriors is a football and cheerleading organization in Winters, CA, Located in Northern CA. We need to raise money to purchase new equipment so we can replace our old equipment, but our organization has little to no money to purchase it on our own. We like your product and though it would be a good idea to raise funds through partnership through your company. I believe this could benefit both sides of the partnership, as you would receive advertising at a very low cost, while we receive a product a discounted price allowing us to fundraise even more money.
