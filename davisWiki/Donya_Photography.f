My name is Deeba Yavrom and I am a wedding Photographers photographer based out of Davis CA.  I am a UC Davis alum and have been shooting weddings  weddings for over 5 years.  If you can boil my type of photography down to one style, I would have to say that photojournalism fits the best. I have been on staff with Oakland Tribune, Miami Herald, and have freelanced for the Sacramento Magazine and Davis Enterprise, among others.   I urge you to take a look at my website, my photos and my philosophy and let me know what you think.  Hope to hear from you soon!
