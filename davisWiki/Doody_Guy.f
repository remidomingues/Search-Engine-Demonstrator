Note from the owner:

Hello, my name is Victor and I am the DoodyGuy. The Doody Guy turns 3 in April (21 in dog years) and I can now say that business is great! Throughout the U.S. there are thousands of Pet Waste Disposal companies, in the Sacramento area over 25, but in Yolo County I am the only one.  Even though Doody Guy is the only pet waste company in the area, we still strive to provide the best possible service with the best prices anywhere.

Doody Guy primarily focuses on picking up your pets waste, removing it from the property, and disposing of it for you in an environmentally friendly way (including composting). I also design compost systems utilizing dog waste, as well as pet repellent technology that keeps your pets from going to the bathroom on your childs outdoor play equipment or rosebushes for that matter. We are also proud to be the first Ecofriendly landscaping company in the U.S. utilizing equipment that does not use gasoline or oil. I am also working on a patent for an advanced green fertilizer/paint to cover urine acid spots left in the grass by female dogs. I stress to people that my service is somewhat like that of a landscaper, maid, or pool service in that I charge low rates, come to your home weekly, and on most occasions Im in and out in less than 5 minutes.

Our service is ideal for the working professional who does not have the time to pick up after his/her dog, the housewife or househusband who doesnt want to step in poo then track it in their home, or for seniors who have trouble crouching and/or do not want their waste bins filled with poo.  Its not uncommon to see me talking to your dog and trading stares and whispers with your furry friend.

I not only pick up your best friends doody, but I also look for healthy and unhealthy trends in their pet waste, make diet recommendations, and point out anything out of the ordinary that I notice. I also have a network of quality professional groomers and trainers should you have any questions or need their services.

If you have any questions please dont hesitate to call me or learn more about us at http://www.doodyguy.com DoodyGuy.com

Thanks for your support,

Victor  (AKA the Doody Guy)




20090531 19:30:36 nbsp The Doody Guy came to my house (actually my back yard) and did a one time clean up.  I had let things get out of hand!  He was very flexible schedule wise, came before I left for work, in the early am, and did a great job.  I recommend Vic as a great way to take care of the smelly side of dog ownership.   My dogs liked him too! Users/HazelWatson

20100418 20:30:58 nbsp We have been very happy with the Doody guy, who does weekly yard maintenance for us, in addition to cleaning up after our dog. Not only are his rates better than our previous yard service, but also his include the poop pickup and he uses environmentally friendly equipment (a nonpolluting lawn mower, etc.) He is super responsive, and does and great job. Highly recommend his service.  Users/MEW

Today, he came over and cleaned up my backyard and did an AMAZING job! Vic is a really cool guy to deal with and very professional. Also, his rates are incredible for the quality of his work!
