Dori Stone is the education and outreach director for Project Compost.

Dori is an organizer of Earth friendly/ecorelated free educational events around campus. She contributes to many sociallyconscious causes, too numerous for me to list. She is a UCD student. It would be nice if she would put a little about herself here so folks could pass comments on to her, such as: how about creating a web page (wiki is fine) for your current events list?
