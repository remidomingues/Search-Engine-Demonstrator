Dotty Huber is by far the greatest authority on wiki:WikiPedia:Aristotle Aristotle in our area.  She taught Critical Thinking, English 1C, at Woodland Community College early in this century.  She is a beautiful women too.  If you ever want to understand the mechanics of any argument you have ever presented, she would be the one to consult.  She may still reside in Woodland, but I have no idea where she teaches, if at all, these days.  She is the best English teacher you could ever have.
