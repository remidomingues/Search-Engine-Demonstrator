A double Aggie is a student or alumnus of a U.C. Davis graduate program who also attended UCD as an undergraduate.  Beyond this most basic definition, the precise requirements to be a double Aggie are unclear.  The majority view holds that one must have previously received a bachelors degree from UC Davis, and then received or be working towards a graduate degree from UCD to qualify.  The minority view holds that taking any graduate classes after being enrolled as an undergraduate is sufficient.

Some Users/TomGarbers double Aggies have never heard of the term.  Go figure.
