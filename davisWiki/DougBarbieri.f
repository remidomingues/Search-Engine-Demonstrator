Turn Watcher is a cool little app.  If only I used a computer at the table.  Neat program, though. Users/JabberWokky jw

Thank you! If you ever change your mind about a laptop at the table, let me know. :) Users/DougBarbieri

I only go to movies on Tuesday night after they are $4 each, I show up early to stake my claim with a jacket or sumat, then walk over to newsbeat etc to grab goodies to smuggle in, and then I make it back right before previews start, cause those are the only commercials I could be interested in. It makes for a decent regal experience  Users/StevenDaubert

Thats a great ideaI should do that sometime! Users/DougBarbieri
