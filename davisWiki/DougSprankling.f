 Doug Sprankling 

 This is him 

Doug Sprankling was born and raised in Davis, and has lived there his entire life.  Except that he was born in San Francisco maybe and also just moved away.  After graduating in the Davis High School Class of 2006, he went to New Jersey for further education.  Its alright.

Doug enjoys many aspects of Davis, such as the trees and the Delta Breeze wind and the Armadillo Music.
