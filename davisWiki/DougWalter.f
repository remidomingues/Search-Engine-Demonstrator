Name: Doug Walter

Phone Number: (530) 7566385

Office: I have worked for the Davis Food Coop since February 1, 1989. I often lead new member orientations, tours for visitors or classes, and otherwise get to interact a lot with members and shoppers. Because of my long involvement with the DFC, please revert my edits about it if I stray too far into meddling.

I have also spent significant time over the years working with Solar Community Housing Association Solar Community Housing Association, and with the Whole Earth Festival Whole Earth Festival. I dont have any formal tie to either now, but I certainly try to keep in touch with all the volunteers who make these unique resources available to our community.

Personality: I chose a photo of me taken by a friend after a full day of dance performances at a Renaissance Fair somewhere in Northern California (cant remember exactly which one, though). It shows me tired, but happy and willing to eat, drink and talk for just a little longer. Thats a good day for me, and that should give you some insight into my personality.

I like to dance, especially Irish Dancing Irish and Scottish dancing with http://siamsa.net Siamsa le Cheile and Raven Valley Irish Dance school. I like to sing, especially with friends like my partner, Donna Lemongello. I like to spend time in the beautiful world that surrounds us. I love to read, and sometimes to write about what Ive read.
This photo was taken by my sister Laurie and shows (back row) me, my nephew Brendan Marshall, his dad Dan Marshall, (front row) Donna Lemongello, and my mother, Pat Walter. Lenny the dog is posing adorably in front of Pat and Donna.

Lenny: After more than sixteen years of faithful companionship, Lenny still would not give up and was starving to death. So on June 2, 2008, Donna and I said goodbye and had him euthanized. He was the dog waiting cheerfully outside of Briggs Hall for about a decade (under the ramp past the stairs you see in the righthand photo on the Wiki page). He had many friends and fans; we miss him very much.


Hey Doug, just a note that I responded to your question wiki:wikispot:FAQ over here.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070625 22:57:51 nbsp nice response to Louis Users/StevenDaubert

Thank you. I respect his right to an opinion, and Im fine with people thinking highly of Mike. I cant make a crusade out of it, but I dislike it when people simplify an issue (e.g. Covell Village) in a way that obfuscates. Im always working on how to express my views succinctly yet accurately.  DougWalter

20070626 20:42:29 nbsp I commend louis on his overall enthusiasm and support of a project designed by local builders and developers. It was a remarkable development with more environmental features than anything else being built locally today. Stop sugar coating the reason it failed.........Davis has become an elitist community, to buy a home here you must be high income, UCD affiliate, or a previous homeowner taking advantage of the appreciation gained over the years. It is not the family community long time Davis residents once enjoyed, where opportunity was available to all income levels. As the fortunate few examine the way they express themselves ie: dont take yourself so seriously.....Super Green Target comes in. Users/Jeffreymh

I dont find this comment fully comprehensible. I did talk with folks who were happy to see a project coming forward that wasnt from Lewis Homes, or Pulte, or Kauffman & Broad. It amuses me that you feel the elitism in Davis (which is real) is the reason it failed rather than the traffic that would be generated all through East Davis. Poor people and students dont particularly like choked streets.

But Im not sorry that people are still debating the issues of building versus preserving ag land, of traffic traded for accomodating new residents, and of what design we want for Davis of the future. There are going to be fewer natural resources, so the human resources had better improve!

That said, isnt there a better place for debate than on my user page? Or is this the hip way to drive traffic to my photos?  Users/DougWalter

20070630 22:38:30 nbsp How totally cool that the Capital O has disappeared from the DFC page! It makes me feel that ranting has a purpose on the wiki! :) Users/DougWalter

20070926 00:22:21 nbsp hey! dont go showing me up! ;) Hi Doug! How are you? Users/MichelleAccurso

20070926 12:17:30 nbsp Ha ha. I like that you abbreviated your own name. You went through SMF? You know you have to tell me what airline you were flying and where you were going. (You cant NOT tell these things to aviation nerds, it kills them.) Thats a shame, its always nice to see people you know outside of the airport. Have a good one! Users/MichelleAccurso

20070926 23:03:53 nbsp Yoiks! I just noticed that Im wearing the same blue scarf in both photos  it has woodblock prints on it by my friend http://members.cruzio.com/~lowashbu/index.html M. Lauren Washburn, a fantastic artist. Users/DougWalter

20070927 22:49:53 nbsp very interesting information on Isao Fujimoto.  Users/JessicaRockwell

20071031 22:20:33 nbsp Hope youre ok after your bike crash, I saw your name in the paper today (and here on the bike tips page).  Glad the helmet helped! Users/EdHenn
  Thanks Ed (along with others whove expressed concern other ways). Im alive and mending with reasonable speed. I couldnt really walk around the house easily yesterday, and today Im well enough to go back to work. I think I was lucky  and Ill endorse quality helmets for any and everyone! Users/DougWalter

20071226 10:13:20 nbsp Thanks for the tip Doug.  I know about the site, but I just couldnt picture what buildings were there.  Are there tin sheds there?  The superfund page does not illuminate. Users/EdHenn

20080202 00:52:37 nbsp Doug, thank you, you are quite kind!  And it is always my pleasure to feed the lovely people of the DFC. Users/PopsicleGirl

20081210 21:27:41 nbsp Hi Doug,
I remember participating on a Coop committee years ago which was developing a new landscape plan for the parking lot after the remodel. There was a lot of talk about adding fruit trees, making a kind of working orchard out front, work committees to do the pruning, etc. It was all pretty idealistic. All I could think about was fruit plopping down onto cars on hot summer days. Fortunately (or not), wiser heads prevailed. The figs may be a relic of that whole process! Users/DonShor

20081212 12:24:57 nbsp Now you did it!  Its up to you now to change that to past tense later tonight!  ;D Users/JabberWokky

20081214 11:37:37 nbsp Hey now... dont joke about that.  Having an incorrect tense on a wiki entry once killed my father.  It was in the great grammar winter of 13, and a stray is, caught by the gale winds, lodged in his leg.  Later that winter he developed a fatal case of the gerunds. Users/JabberWokky
  LOL! Users/DougWalter

20090209 15:41:07 nbsp digdug did you put the souperbowl on the events calender? Users/StevenDaubert

20090426 19:40:34 nbsp And nice catch on MitchellÔºÅ  I was following the MSNBC draft list, and they had him erroneously listed as a UCD player (I should have double checked).  And, youre right about coloring the table rows; its a lot easier to read.  Users/TheAmazingLarry

20090716 09:14:17 nbsp Yeah, I kinda guessed they may have closed, which is why it was a seed... I had planned to look up and see if they were still open.  Thanks for the edit. Users/JabberWokky

20090805 20:18:05 nbsp Nice idea for an entry, but you might want to find points to distinguish it from the Fruit core group, and on the wiki, the free food entry. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090813 18:28:24 nbsp Hey Doug Tell Donna her old friend from Morristown High is looking to get in touch. Still here 80 Maple Ave.  Morris Plains, NJ 07950 Users/magdaskitchen@yahoo.com

20091004 15:43:44 nbsp Have you given a listen to wiki:wikipedia:Blackmores Night?  Im not saying youd like it, but you might.  A friend here found that I liked Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention and we had a brief listening party at his place.  He was picking out songs, so I cant speak for the band in general (and yes, its Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple). Users/JabberWokky

20091028 18:45:07 nbsp This week and next week are the two biggest weeks for midterms. All my classes this quarter have their midterms in this period. I know that myself and Users/OliviaY were kept away by studying. Yes, we could have changed the date, but eh.... Users/WilliamLewis
   Too bad, then, but I guess its ultimately an eh... and catch you both sometime in the future. Users/DougWalter

20091216 19:25:02 nbsp I think any phrase that uses hegemony or more than two repetitions of a word falls into that category.  EGREGIOUS use of CAPITAL LETTERS just makes me think of Zippy the Pinhead. Users/JabberWokky

20100120 12:21:35 nbsp SCHA is currently cooperative in name only. Snarky or not, its true. :( Users/PxlAted

20101230 18:29:40 nbsp I wouldnt give up just yet. The discussion isnt done.  Users/WilliamLewis

20101230 20:38:09 nbsp You think the link to info about Mr. Reynolds is truly not good for the public at large, or is it that you work at the Coop and are, on some level, associated with him through that source and therefore feel the need to support him or face some type of retribution? Users/WesP
  Im going to treat this as a serious inquiry, even though I find the implications potentially insulting: no, I think that the Food Coop is sufficiently public that I could draw attention to any substantive attempt to retaliate or impose a quid pro quo. Plus, as a very long time employee, I probably can survive some subtle attempt grins. I stated in a comment that I consider Mr. Reynolds a friend (maybe not a boon companion, but definitely not just a professional acquaintance), and I care about DavisWiki and not using it as a weapon. So I am trying to balance a lot of competing interests & perspectives on editing this page, and on how this wiki should treat businesses. I guess I should thank you for asking, if theres anyone else who thought that might be the case, cause you gave me a chance to say how I see the story behind the story. Users/DougWalter

  It was, and still is, merely an inquiry. I  meant no offense and apologize if any was made. I have been on the receiving end of retaliation by a former employer in the past (not a wiki reference) when I was involved in a PSM about job safety down in the bay. The employer took it as an attack since he was violating OSHA codes.  I was just curious if this is what you feared and why you were seemingly supporting the attorneys side of things, or if you genuinely felt it did a larger harm than good making the information available.  Users/WesP

20110101 11:39:28 nbsp I posted this on the Talk page, but wanted to make sure you saw it.  Either youre skimming over a lot of stuff, or youre being somewhat blind to the efforts going on due to your concern for somebody you know (which is understandable; frustration doesnt exactly lead to wishing to read through details of conversations): Regarding inconsistency: What are you talking about? There has been a fair bit of effort expended here and elsewhere to forge exactly what youre talking about. Youre saying that theres some kind of picking on him going on, when there is a brand new interwiki map to the CalBar that is set up so that we can link the record of every attorney, and there are a few attorneys ‚Äî like law professor Richard Alcauskas ‚Äî on whose profiles the new link formats are being tested on for community feedback before all the attorney entries on the wiki are linked to their public bar association profiles. Im rather horrified that you either missed or are glossing over the fairly comprehensive, multiperson discussion going on about how to best format and make these links for all attorney entires thought this was some kind of selective badgering. Please read through this and the other talk pages and note that there are several people working on a large project across the wiki. Stephen just happened to be the first one done because he happened to be the first attorney somebody noted something like this about. Hes not some kind of singled out victim of lynching, and you are dismissing a great deal of thought, discussion and earnest concern by several people trying to figure out how best to present this type of information ethically and with consideration for all facets of the community.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20110607 20:26:06 nbsp Your edit just now reminded me of a British comedy skit where people are wading through swamp in the heart of Africa or something, all looking determined and worn down, and a chipper mailman zips in and hands one of them a package and zips out again. Users/JabberWokky
  Lovely image. Tut, tut: we cant tolerate shoddy grammar in the part that will still be here if every comment is deleted (which, as I understand it, isnt being proposed at this time). I, too, love the Jerry Springer Header.

  I had to download it from the other page, then upload it. This worked fine, but talking with Steven on the phone made it clearer faster. Thanks to you both for assistance.

20111119 14:43:01 nbsp I dont like where you are going with the apparent, and the footnote to the police chiefs (we were armed an in a huge group  but those students could have overwhelmed us at any time)

grow a spine! it reeks of political correctness I expect more from you Users/StevenDaubert

20111119 14:47:33 nbsp I just cant buy the lie, granted the students had numbers, its just the body language of all the officers (including pike) dont look / act threatened, until they precipitated the issue  Users/StevenDaubert
  Thats my interpretation as well, but I think its an interpretation from someone who was in bed while this was going on. Hence I thought it wise to be temperate, lest a helicopter video suddenly emerge. But I dont feel strongly about that one word. DW

20120605 11:48:23 nbsp There was a nowdeleted talk page for the original coop page.  On it Angel had said, Should this page be redirected to J Street Coops instead of the other way around since there are now three J Street Coop houses at that corner instead of one?  Im actually not sure of the status.  I just changed it based on what AY had posted.  Feel free to correct it if its wrong.

20130426 17:09:02 nbsp All the oaks are on the north side of the street on private property (the shopping center) and were there before all the infrastructure (power lines, street, and structures), I believe. Have you or your wife seen the list of some 60 trees that are being planted that day? Four are short (dwarf plum, purpleleaf plum), most are of moderate height (chitalpas), and some are tallish (3 blue oaks and 5 red oaks). As the shopping center trees do not fall within the control of the city, I havent paid as much attention to them, but I can tell you that not all will be removed this year. They will leave some and control the growth chemically while new trees are established, to make a better transition. Believe me, as a member of the Tree Commission since 1986, I dont take the removal of trees lightly and I have planted more trees than I can count. I maintain the seedlings of Highway 113, dragging the water trailer out there behind my vehicle every three weeks from May to September (actually starting in March this year because of the dry winter). I am fully committed to maintaining and increasing the urban forest in and around Davis. The Claremont trees were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Users/DavidRobinson

20131122 16:37:47 nbsp I could have sworn the trade illegalities were mentioned  also the Humus thing. Cest La Vie. I found the whole thing patently ridiculous from the start but my input at the time was less than stellar mainly b/c I was so jaded on the concept Users/StevenDaubert

20131122 22:11:20 nbsp yeah I remembered it being a tiny bit larger I just wasnt sure {{{:)}}}  Users/StevenDaubert

20131214 13:14:28 nbsp Village Bakery may well be just set up to accept tips (and may not even be aware of it).  That would put an authorization hold of a small amount on every bill.  Kerfluffles like this have happened before on the wiki, and then everybody realized that it was a temporary charge by the transaction company.  Or, of course, it could always be an employee pocketing money.  That happens too.   Id say it was worth integrating either way. Users/JabberWokky
  Good  dont want to send any grief to V.B. DW

20140108 21:37:26 nbsp Fair use is kosher on the wiki.  A quote to support, illustrate or demonstrate a topic written about further on the page as a whole should be fine.  And thanks for the updates and clarifications about the coops.  Its good to get this history down from somebody who has been there. Users/JabberWokky
  Thanks for the comments. I have been using the old, deleted comments on the Pacifico page, as well as my memories and links, to document. Im glad its appreciated, and some time it will probably be of use to someone. DW

20140807 13:53:18 nbsp I already filled it up. Pleased? Yeah, you caught me not reading the The Enterprise or The Bee. Maybe I should do that. I tend to read the national (i.e. ABC...) and international news, not the local. Maybe I should change my reading habits. Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140807 15:18:08 nbsp I didnt know the expression of mileage very well. Is this true in your opinion: But that‚Äôs not what YMMV means. What it means is just the opposite of what it says: YMMV acknowledges that the speaker knows there is material he or she (but really, let‚Äôs be honest: he) has failed or refused to address. YMMV performs a scoff: ‚ÄúI cannot be troubled to ponder options beyond my own immediate experience.‚Äù Or even worse, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve considered that there are other possibilities, but I have deemed them unworthy of further attention.‚Äù YMMV is a way of feigning sympathy without meaning it. https://medium.com/@ibogost/ymmv10df2d6b9f77 Source So you wouldnt have any sympathy for me not reading The Bee etc.? Users/ConstantiaOomen
  Constantia, please calm down.  YMMV is a polite, nice way of saying, thats how I see it, but Im not insisting you cant have your own view point too, based on your life experience (i.e., your mileage).   It is a term that is typically used to be friendly and indicate understanding and pleasant acknowledgment that other viewpoints are valid as well, and does not in any way warrant such an aggressive and negative response.  Particularly when an observation is followed with a smile and stating outright that his thoughts on the subject were simply his opinion. Users/JabberWokky jw
 Im afraid we have a culture (or personality, or both) clash here. Im very calm, I was just asking about the true meaning of this expression. I didnt think Doug was mad or something, I saw that smiley too. But as a linguist (or: former linguist) I want to know the details of a language I want to embed in.
Dutch people are very direct and sometimes brutally honest; Im afraid my actions are being interpreted as aggressive or negative.

Well, some internet cultures in the Netherlands √°re very rude and aggressive (for those who want to dive in: http://www.geenstijl.nl this infamous website), but I dont consider myself part of them. Users/ConstantiaOomen
