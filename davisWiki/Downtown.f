Downtown Davis is generally considered to consist of the dense collection of local Davis Downtown Business Association businesses that lie where the lettered streets intersect with the numbered streets. The downtown also includes a number of Apartment Complexes apartment buildings and private residences. Downtown Davis is cute, sweet and quietmost of the time, anyway. There are a number of Downtown Map Signs helpful map signs in case you get lost or are looking for something in particular. Its one of the best places to spot town characters like the dude that Human Powered Housing Project lives in his bike.

Downtown is easily walkable. Parking is available throughout downtown, so you can drop off your car and brave the streets on foot.  Most of downtown is subject to 60, 90, or 120minute parking restrictions on weekdays until either 6pm or 10pm (generally, the closer you get to campus, the shorter the time limit and the later it lasts into the evening).  Watch out for the paid parking lot by the E Street Plazathere are signs clearly labeling it as paid parking, but theyre possible to miss if youre focused on not running over pedestrians and cyclists on a busy day.

The area is also very Bicycling bikeable!  There are bike racks all over downtown and, in case you run into any trouble, a number of Bike Shops bike shops.  Keep a sharp eye out, though, since there can be a lot of traffic, cars parking and deparking, and car doors opening suddenly.  The city has even started painting Sharrows sharrows or shared lane markers thatll direct bikes out away from the curb, into the center of the lane, in some of the more hazardprone areas.  For the uninitiated, the bicycling tips page is worth a read before venturing downtown on two wheels.

Downtown is bordered in part by the train tracks, and its home to a very attractive train station.  Railroad aficionados can go railfanning there, while travelers can catch a ride on Amtrak.  You might even spot some people protesting (or climbing) the controversial Olive Drive Railroad Fence.  The station has a fairly large parking lot that can come in handy on busy evenings when street parking gets scarce.

If youre looking for something to do downtown, dont worry.  Youll find it.  Wander around and check out some of the art, both in galleries and Art in Public Places out in the open.  Central Park is a great place for a picnic or, if youre there on a Wednesday eve or Saturday morning, you can check out the Farmers Market.  Many of the restaurants and cafes have both indoor and outdoor seating if you want to relax with a drink and do some people watching.  Theres all sorts of shopping, and all three movie theaters are right downtown.

Dating back to 1868, the grid of downtown was created by the Davisville Land Company.
