20111114 19:46:56 nbsp Lily Starling is one of the best massage therapist I have been to and I highly recommend her. As a former massage therapist myself, Lily has just the right touch.  Her sessions are incredibly pampering even if you receive massage for medical needs.  She is fabulous and I have referred several friends to her and they have enjoyed her massages as well.  Her hot stone, cranial sacral, myofascial release etc. are wonderful. Users/plynnbryant@sbcglobal.net

20120227 16:22:08 nbsp Mereb is excellent, friendly, and attentive. Massage was deep yet very relaxing and comfortable helped my pain/tightness associated with disk problems in my back and neck. Highly recommended Users/stevejinks

20120321 20:31:42 nbsp I had horrible migraines for 6 days in a row so I went in to see Lily (fortunately, she had a rare cancellation).  She did cranial sacral work on me.  I feel asleep right away and woke up restored and have been headache free since then.  She said while I was sleeping my neck had some significant releases.  Thanks Lily!

20120327 17:10:09 nbsp Im a Davis native, now a grad student in the Bay Area and am working on a massive paper. Went home to visit my folks and decided to check this place out and see if they could work out the stress that has been accumulating in my back. I chose this place because the prices are reasonable and because of the online appointment function. When I walked in, Eloisa was super friendly and warm  she seemed to really want to make sure that she would give me what I needed. She was really responsive when I asked her to make adjustments and I left feeling lighter, refreshed and just happier. The next day, my back was noticeably looser and my good mood persisted. I totally intend to come back whenever Im in town again.  Users/Ziwei.Hu

20120329 21:13:12 nbsp ahhh Lily, she is amazing. I went in for my twingy lower back, and neck stiffness (Im also a migraine sufferer) and had a 90 min. massage that left me feeling like she had released not just stress, and tightness, but large amounts of toxins. A massage with Lily is more than just a massage, it is like a full day spa treatment, rolled into 90 min. I always leave feeling absolutely transformed, and like I shouldnt be operating heavy machinery. Users/DjinaAriel

20120524 11:26:54 nbsp I have a A LOT of massages in my life.  I have a chronic pain problem that requires regular massage.  I was really afraid to book with Mereb because I had been seeing Lily for so long and booking with a guy isnt really my thing. My first massage with Mereb was some what of an out of body experience. I fell asleep it was so relaxing, which has literally never happened to me before.  Honestly I felt reborn.  Since then, Ive gotten all my friends to book with Mereb and we all refer to him as Magic Hands.  As much as I love Eloisa and Lily, Ill only book with them now if I cannot get in with Mereb. There is honestly nothing like a massage with Mereb.  He is the only one who fixes my neck pain, as a result Ive becomes addicted to his magic hands! Users/dina2901

20120709 21:41:32 nbsp I have had two massages with Mereb and he is fantastic at gauging problem areas in order to work on them.  I highly recomend!!!  Users/BethJacobs

20120731 18:21:55 nbsp Downtown Davis Massage and Wellness is one of the best massage places I have ever been to.  I highly recommend all three of their massage therapists as Ive tried them all and believe that they are all unbelievable.  For UCD students, they have discounted rates that make this affordable as well.  I generally book with either Mereb and Eloisa depending on my schedule and always leave feeling refreshed.  I came in yesterday with a horrible cold, and Eloisa was the most understanding about how I felt sporting a summer cold. She took great care of me, and tailored the massage so that I would be able to breathe easier and relax.  Thank you Downtown Davis Massage and Wellness. I dont know what Ill do without you when I move back to LA. Users/JennyFang

20120813 13:12:44 nbsp I had my very first massage experience with Eloisa Flores and couldnt have been more impressed! She was extremely friendly, attentive, and knew all the right places to add additional pressure. I will definitely be going back soon! Users/JohnSchwab

20120813 20:58:07 nbsp Just had an amazing massage from Lily this weekend. She is one of the best! Felt so relaxed. The place is also pretty cool  very nice ambiance, clean. Will go back for sure!  Users/ShubhaAnanthakrishnan

20120819 nbsp I went in to see Lily on Friday, she was amazing!!! Users/nu1985

20120911 20:27:33 nbsp Ive had massages from Eloisa and Lily — both are so great! I cant describe how wonderful I feel right now after getting a massage from Eloisa. I walked in with tense shoulders, hip, and lower back and now I feel absolutely amazing! I cant wait to go back again. Users/VinceBuffalo

20121015 12:42:37 nbsp I recently injured my knee and it was a little difficult to walk with. Meeting Lily at a local event a month ago, I decided to make a very last minute appointment with Downtown Davis Massage and Wellness. An appointment was conveniently scheduled with Paula. The appointment went wonderful. Paula was very helpful and did wonders for my knee. She both very knowledge and extremely skilled. Super glad that I decided to make the leap of faith. Definitely going to make my way back! Users/KevinBui

20121029 10:32:19 nbsp Had my first professional massage last week, from Jill. It was great! The building was smaller than I expected, but the massage was professional, relaxing, and extremely effective on the back pain Ive been carrying around for the last few months. Also, compared to other Davis massage places, the prices seemed very reasonable. Users/zombiek
