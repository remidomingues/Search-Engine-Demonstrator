The Downtown Davis Treewalk is a selfguided tour of some of the oldest and most interesting trees in the downtown area. It was originally created in 1994 by Bob Cordrey, Diane Medlock, and Ken Nunes as the Downtown Tour of Landmark Trees and was substantially revised in 2006 by TREE Davis executive director Ruth Williams, Mike Ozonoff, and Users/DavidRobinson David Robinson with consultation from many community members to reflect changes that had occurred since its inception.

(Design and publishing support for the treewalk brochure, which is available at the southeast corner of 2nd Street 2nd St. and D Street D St., were provided by MAK Design Build, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), and Coldwell Banker Doug Arnold Real Estate, Inc.).

The walk starts at Gilbert Menkes scupture and includes the Catalina cherry in back of the Hamel House, once the home of Henry Jacob Hamel and now the location of the Coldwell Banker office, the massive valley oak in Central Park, familiar to everyone who shops at the Davis Farmers Market, and ends at the beautiful Deodar cedar at 132 C St., which marks the entrance to downtown Davis from the south.

The current guide still includes the Mansion Square/Gray Pine which used to tower over the Mansion Square shopping center/office complex and got knocked over in a wind storm, cut down and turned into mulch between 14 and 17 February 2008.

There will be four opportunities to join us on the Downtown Davis Treewalk this springon 3, 10, 17, and 24 April. Well meet at the fountain in the E Street Plaza at 6:00PM and start the tour, which will take about an hour and 15 minutes, at 6:15PM.
