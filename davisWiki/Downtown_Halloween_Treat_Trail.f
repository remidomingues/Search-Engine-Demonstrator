The Downtown Halloween Treat Trail is a Halloween event run by the Davis Downtown Business Association.  The purpose of running this event is to provide a safe environment for kids to do their trickortreating.  Almost exclusively treating, though.  Some parents get really into it, others just wander in their regular clothes, a few feet behind their kids.  Most of the businesses downtown take part in the Trail, so one could rake in a decent haul without too much walking.

Some teens make halfassed attempts at costumes (read: they put on the mask from their 5yearold costume, if they put in that much effort) and try to scam candy from businesses.  It should be noted here that the Treat Trail is intended for those 10 years of age and younger, and candy is not free.

The Downtown Halloween Treat Trail will run from 2:00PM to 5:00PM on Monday, October 31, 2011.
