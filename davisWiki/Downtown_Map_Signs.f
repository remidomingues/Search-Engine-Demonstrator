The Downtown Map Signs are located in various places and provide helpful information about both downtown Davis and Davis as a whole.  They are contained in  a artistic metal frame and sometimes have paper maps that you can take away with you.

These maps are located at:

   North West corner of C Street and 3rd Street in Central Park
   West side of E Street between 2nd Street and 3rd Street
   South East corner of G Street and 2nd Street
   North East corner of G Street and 4th Street
   South West corner of E Street  and 1st Street (in front of Borders)

 This is hilarious and deserves a photo demonstrating the fact!  The folks behind the Keep Davis Boring movement would probably be interested. Users/TomGarberson
