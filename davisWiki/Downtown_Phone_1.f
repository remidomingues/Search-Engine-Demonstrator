Location: At the end of 2nd Street, outside the makeshift Post Office and right across the street from the forklike monument, The Train Station, and Tres Hermanas.

Description: There isnt an abundance of payphones with little glass rooms surrounding them in Davis, so this is one of the fancier models. Includes a phone book and what may or may not be a functioning lamp.

Charge: 50 cents for local calls
