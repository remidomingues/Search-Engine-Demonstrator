R.I.P. This phone, once located across from Central Park and next to Crepeville, sat in the little park with the huge tree.  The phone was around for a while and removed some time in late April of 2006.  The phone number was (530) 7579722.

While its sitting in a parkish area, the phone isnt secluded.  Your calls will be brushed by numerous pedestrians on this busy street Downtown.


This phone rang while my friends and Users/TusharRawat I were walking past. Naturally we picked it up and pretended we were at a pizza restaurant. We walked by it again on a different day and it rang again! Sadly the third time we walked by it did not, and honestly, we were all a bit disappointed.

Teens from the Teen Center used to sit around in view of the pay phone and watch as people picked up their prank calls. It was sort of a fun way to pass their afternoon. As an employee I never stopped them because in a juvenile way, it was usually pretty funny!
