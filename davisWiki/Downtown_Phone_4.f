Phone Number: (530) 7534471

Location: Between the first stop sign of Campus and Cafe Roma, on 3rd Street, Downtown.

Description:The phone has since (20041231) been fixed and is far less interesting now.  Current phone is pictured below:


As of 20041101, the phone looked very friendly, and even had a sticker telling everyone walking by you are beautiful (all photos pictured left).  However, the phone looked like it had been shattered or otherwise broken.  It still gave a dial tone, though.  Sometimes talking with a mouth piece in one hand and an ear piece in the other can be exciting.

Charge: 50 cents for local calls
