My name is Josh DOZER Johnson. I intend to make that my legal name because my name is boring, people have even confuse my emails for spam due to my dull name. I was told it would be in my best interest to establish my identity. I have lived in Davis for two years. I dont really know what to put here, I dont know if there is anything unique or special about me. But I do wake up and tell myself today I am going to make a difference for the better in somebody elses day. Whether its making another person laugh or making their day easier or whatever, that is my goal. I dont think I can solve world hunger, save the whales or our economy, but I can help a person here and there. I can help the small picture.

 I have decided to leave Davis and continue my education elsewhere. I just cant take being harassed at the Churches in Davis because of Catalyst and Matt Robbins. So I wish Davis the best of luck and hope for the best in the future.


20110406 22:15:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Thank you for sharing your experiences; Im sorry they were so unpleasant.  Take a moment to check out the identity pagegiven the difficult nature of your experiences, I can understand why you might not want to attach your name to the comment, but introducing yourself would add weight to the comment, for the simple reason it means youre standing behind your experiences with your name.  Your call; just a suggestion.  Regardless, welcome. Users/TomGarberson

20110407 19:10:34 nbsp Youre welcome, and a belated welcome to the wiki.  Those of us who edit the wiki struggle sometimes to try to be fair and to prevent blowups that can be painful for all, and I think thats some of the reaction youre seeing from other editors.  Thanks for working with us to sort things out.  As for me, I believed your comment when I first read it and I still believe it, so I am glad to stand up for you.  If what you say is true, it is an awful thing to have had happen.  You have my sympathies. Users/CovertProfessor

20110407 22:50:20 nbsp Dozer, theres no such thing as a site worker.  Youre equal to Tom or CP or anybody else when it comes to content.  Were all just neighbors working on a shared project here, just like you are.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20110501 09:30:36 nbsp /Talk pages are for discussing the content on the page in question, not for leaving comments about the subject of the page. Users/JasonAller

20110501 18:18:55 nbsp You probably should move those comments to the main entry... talk pages are typically used for editorial discussion about the wiki entry itself (formatting, finding photos, etc), not the subject of the wiki entry. Users/JabberWokky

20110608 15:01:40 nbsp Dozer,

 When do you leave? I am going to be visiting Davis over the summer and if you are still in town I would love to meet you man. I am really sad to read all that Catalyst and that shady Matt Robbins have done to you. I hope you havent lost your faith in God through all of this. Just so you know, I grew up around Christians, in a Christians church and in my experience and opinions, those are NOT Christians. Users/VincentB
