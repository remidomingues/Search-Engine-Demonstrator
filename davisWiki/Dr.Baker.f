Hi, and welcome to the Davis Wiki. Seems like you should have your own page, since youre now an official Davis Wiki Editor. Users/DonShor

Dr. Baker is an optometrist with Helmus & Helmus.


20120520 20:37:33 nbsp Thank you for going along with the emerging consensus.  It is very much appreciated and says a lot for your character.  Speaking for myself, I never thought your intent was malicious, only that you were defending your business, as you said.  It would be great if at some point between diaper changes that you did find the time to create an eye questions forum.  Im sure there were many eye questions on peoples minds today with the solar eclipse! Users/CovertProfessor

20120520 20:45:48 nbsp Thanks, tell you what, if you create the page and post the first question I will be happy to answer it.  Well see if that gets the ball rolling.  My friend Wayne (the photo editor for the Enterprise) just posted a great shot that he took from his front yard.  Ill see if I can figure out how to post it here. Users/Dr.Baker


20120520 20:52:18 nbsp Wow!!!!  Thats awesome!!!

Its a deal  I will create the page for you. Users/CovertProfessor

20120520 22:30:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Dr. Baker!  I absolutely love the Dental Questions and Garden Questions pages.  Theyre among the best resources around here.  Thanks so much for answering the Eye Questions! Users/TomGarberson

20120521 13:05:57 nbsp Dr. B thanks for taking the time to come to the wiki. I know of several working professionals who have no love lost for the wiki. However once you start to see how powerful a resource it has become for the community with both live and work in... Users/StevenDaubert

20120523 08:50:05 nbsp Cool page for the eye questions.  I think we met a few months back and you said you were thinking about doing an eye questions page, well it looks great.  It seems people have quite a few questions, I think it is great you are helping out. Users/DagonJones

20120709 16:42:07 nbsp I wanted to mention that your responses to some of the comments on Helmus & Helmus are very good. Users/TomGarberson

20130720 18:55:32 nbsp But it would spoil the mystery if I told, wouldnt it? Users/CovertProfessor
