What is Chiropractic?
Chiropractic is a healing art based on science and philosophy. Chiropractors focus on the fact that the nervous system is the master control system of the body. If the joints of the spine and extremities become misaligned and stuck, known as subluxation, this can cause degeneration of the joint, improper sensory signaling to the brain, poor motor control and coordination of muscles and a whole host of other malfunctions of the nerves in that area. Additionally this stuck joint can cause a cascade effect, meaning that the lost motion will show up somewhere else and cause problems at that location. This can cause pain or dysfunction in seemingly unrelated areas of the body. Chiropractors perform adjustments to correct stuck joints, or subluxations. An adjustment is a careful application of just the right amount of pressure, in a very specific direction, either done by hand or with percussion devices, that restores the proper positioning and motion of the joint. This allows the joint to resume normal function and reduce the interference or irritation to the surrounding nerves. When you restore proper nerve signaling and function your body goes into healing mode, as it is designed to do, and many miraculous things can follow!

Some comments about symptoms
Symptoms, most notably pain, are a warning sign in the body that something is not right. They are not to be ignored but symptoms themselves are not the problem. Simply eliminating pain, unfortunately, does not mean you are healthy and functioning at optimal levels. Many common spinal problems can cause progressive and permanent joint degeneration, or nerve signal interference, EVEN IF THERE IS NO PAIN. Although chiropractors are happy to help patients reduce or stop their pain, if true health and wellness is your goal then you need to see a chiropractor that has a practice philosophy that goes beyond pain treatment.

20110419 20:22:45 nbsp After having been to multiple chiropractors in Davis, all to no avail, I was extremely enthralled once I found my now permanent chiropractor, Dr. Cloyd. His expertise and precise methods of care have really paid off in the case of my scoliosis and I never realized I would ever overcome the constant pain my back has encumbering me with over the past 5 years. Definitely one of the best in the Davis/Sacramento area, in my opinion. Overall very professional, very resultoriented, and it has improved my day to day life very drastically.  Users/SamElmo22

20110627 21:09:08 nbsp I was in a bad car accident a little over a year ago I and I went to a number of different specialists to help with my pain and mobility without much difference.  I saw his presentation and figure why not try this too.  What luck.  I was a little hesitant because my experience over the past year but after my first session I noticed a slight difference.  After several sessions there was a big difference.  I sleep better, I feel better and I am so delighted to be able to exercise again.  I would highly recommend him to anyone look for help.

20120313 13:05:51 nbsp I had a pain in my back for months before I went to my doctor.  He sent me to have a CAT scan and an MRI.  Both were normal for my age, 71.  My doctor recommended physical therapy.  A friend recommended Dr. Bryon.  I was skeptical of chiropractic treatment but decided to try.  After two months of adjustments with Bryon, and with the stretching exercises he recommended, I have no pain, I sleep better and feel better.  Ill stay with Bryon for a long time!
