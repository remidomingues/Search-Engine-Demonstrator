For those of you who are not very familiar with Chiropractic, it is the art/science/philosophy of correcting spinal misalignments to promote optimal nerve function. Having physical, emotional, and chemical stress on the body can create an unbalance both in the nervous system and in the structural system which is our frame work. This unbalance leads to joint misalignment. When your joints are not moving properly the body reacts by creating localized inflammation and muscle spasms that further lock the joint and keep it from moving correctly. All of the inflammation and muscle spasms as well as the actual misaligned joint can cause compression of the nerves that exit the spine. Nervous tissue is very sensitive tissue, so only the slightest amount of pressure on the nerve can cause it to malfunction and not submit its electrical signals properly. This further becomes a problem when you take into consideration the very important function of your nervous system the nerves carry messages from the brain to the rest of your body (tissues, organs, glands) and vice versa, so when the nerve is not working properly a disconnection occurs between the brain and body which can lead to devastating disease.

Chiropractic care is a safe and gentle approach to correcting your spinal misalignments. With Chiropractic, your body can experience optimal balance, optimal healing, and optimal performance.
