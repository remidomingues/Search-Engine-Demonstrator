Their mission is: To make a positive impact on the world, one person at a time, by sharing our gifts of healing, education, and genuine care.

Why they are different: We are very proud of our unique approach. We take the time to address the whole person, to educate, and to answer your questions. We understand the connection between the physical structure of your body, your nervous system, your biochemical environment, and your energetic/emotional health. We seek to achieve balance of these things through commonsense, natural means. We do this by combining gentle approaches such as specific spinal adjusting, Cranial Sacral therapy, passive motion, and energetic techniques.

    We provide effective, gentle adjusting for adults and children; including infants and pregnant women.

20111115 18:37:24 nbsp Chiropractic services was fine. Not great.
Beware of hidden fees. Ask how much they charge for each service so that you wont be surprised how much they expect you to pay! Student charge was $100 for the first three visits! Really?! Do they really expect students to be able to afford that? Outrageous. Just ask how much they charge BEFORE your first appt. Users/Alyssajew
