 Interview with Dr. Zingaro: 

What Chiropractic College did you attend and why did you choose that school?
When I decided to attend chiropractic school, I had heard that some schools did not have a strong academic program. I visited four colleges and chose to attend Northwestern College of Chiropractic. I chose Northwestern because it had a very strong academic program, especially in the area of science. The clinical science program was taught by Ph.D.s in their field. I also liked the fact that many Northwestern graduates passed the National Board Exams without needing to take review courses, like the other colleges I visited.

Why did you become a chiropractor?
At first, I thought I wanted to be a medical doctor. I started college in a sixyear medical program. In this program, a student completed the premed requirements in the first two years of school and then went to medical school. After completing my premed requirements, I became disillusioned with conventional medicine and decided to pursue the bodymind connection and studied psychology. I graduated with a Masters Degree in Counseling. Although I worked as a counselor for six years, my interest in medicine was still strong and I was continually reading medical literature. At this time, I became very good friends with an elderly medical doctor. I saw that even though this doctor wanted to treat patients with nutrition and other more natural methods, she mostly wrote prescriptions for her patients. I was very aware that prescription medicine had side effects and for this reason I wanted to choose a way to treat patients that did not include prescription medication. I then became interested in manual medicine and decided to become a chiropractor.

What distinguishes you from other chiropractors?
Well, I think Chiropractic, like most work you do with your hands, is an art as well as a science. And this art reflects the soul of the practitioner. So, I would say I am unique (as is everyone else), because of my background as a counselor and the blend of techniques I use. I am also a massage therapist and I have studied many soft tissue and chiropractic techniques.

What techniques do you use?
I use a blend of massage and chiropractic techniques. The type of chiropractic techniques I use is called diversified technique. I have also studied cranial sacral therapy, orthobionomy, somatic therapy, Swedish massage and many other soft tissue techniques.

How do you treat a condition?
I blend effective and gentle chiropractic techniques with massage techniques to address a problem. I examine and treat each person as a unique individual. Even individuals with the same diagnosis may receive different treatments depending on that persons particular needs. Each patient receives my complete attention for at least 45 minutes.

What conditions do you treat?
I treat any musculoskeletal condition .Some of the conditions I treat are: headaches, neck pain, back pain, muscle sprains, carpal tunnel syndrome, rotator cuff injuries, auto injuries, arthritis pain, any joint pain, chronic pain, stress conditions, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome

How long have you been in Davis and why did you choose this area?
I have worked in the Davis area for almost 20 years. I love this area and now have two young children who attend school here. I think its a small town with a lot of good opportunities. I have a saying, If you cant be healthy in Davis, you cant be healthy. With the emphasis on bicycles and swim programs to name a few, its a very healthconscious community.

20100116 15:30:12 nbsp I highly recommend Dr. Zingaro. She was my anatomy/physiology instructor when I attended Integrative Therapy Massage School in 1992. She is the most gentle chiropractor. I have been to about 6 of them on, and off as needed over about a 25 years period starting way back when that my back was killing me when I was working two waitress jobs at a time. Now, she is treating me post treatment from a car accident with massage/ultrasound/and, adjustments. She is an extremely caring person, I really like her, she is helping me alot.
I am getting better, and am very satisfied. Rating AAA+++++++++++++++++++++++

20100930 22:30:30 nbsp I had a painful knot in my neck for about a month and my coworker recommended that I see Dr. Zingaro. I had never been to a chiropractor before, but was tired of the pain and thought I would give it a try. She was very kind and did gentle manipulation. I went to bed that night and the next morning my pain was completely gone. I felt like a car that went to the mechanic and got fixed. I feel very fortunate to have her in our town. I can not recommend her enough.  Users/annemeck

20111203 23:15:37 nbsp I highly recommend Dr. Zingaro. As a massage therapist, I am very careful about chiropractic referrals to my clients. There is a lot of variation across chiropractic styles and I think weve all hear negative stories from chiropractors that are too forceful or not in tune with the clients body. Dr. Zingaro has the benefit of being a massage therapist as well as a chiropractor, so she understands the importance of loosening tight muscles and making sure they are ready to receive bony adjustments. She is also extremely kind, forthright, and puts you at ease right away. I am happy to have her to refer to! And her office is BEAUTIFUL. Give her a call! Users/LilyS

20130924 21:45:37 nbsp I had persistent neck pain from the base of my skull all the way to my fingertips; it made it hard to turn my head or sleep, and sometimes Id get a zap feeling down the neck. It also felt like one of my vertebrae was a little further to the right than the others. I saw my general practice doctor for it, and she took Xrays then told me that it was probably nerve pain and there wasnt much she could do, as the Xrays were normal. She suggested looking for a chiropractor.

I found Dr. Zingaro on my own and went in for an appointment. She immediately asked me if Id seen a GP Doctor and if theyd done any tests, and went through my medical history with me before starting, which I really liked. She got the overly tense muscles which were pulling on my vertebrae to relax, and then put the vertebrae back into place, and I felt better IMMEDIATELY. Not 100% cessation of pain, but significant relief which improved with time. She gave me an athome care regimen and some advise on posture to prevent the problem from returning. Id had the problem for years and never thought too much of it until it worsened, and after my appointment it was better than it had been since high school.

Overall, she was gentle, thorough, very considerate, and extremely skilled. Im really happy with the results, and. Dr. Zingaro herself is extremely professional and compassionate! Users/SarahBon
