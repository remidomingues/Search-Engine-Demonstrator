20100519 00:46:51 nbsp Hey there Doctor D, I cant help http://daviswiki.org/Yolo_Polo_Plaza?actiondiff&version210&version18 but http://daviswiki.org/UC_Davis?actiondiff&version274&version173 notice http://daviswiki.org/UCD_Equestrian_Center?actiondiff&version238&version137 your http://daviswiki.org/Davis?actiondiff&version276&version175 dedication to the UC Davis Polo Club. Why dont you go ahead and make the page for them right here on the wiki? Im sure it would be a fine addition; just click on the dashed link to start it off. (Once you make the page, the dashed line will change to a solid underline.) Oh, and you may also find the Templates/UCD Club template for UCD Clubs helpful. Happy editing! Users/EBT
