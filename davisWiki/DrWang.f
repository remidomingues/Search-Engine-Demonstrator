20081216 18:36:47 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Dr. Wang, and Welcome to the Wiki!     My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  I replied to your comment on Wiki Community/General Discussion.  I also wanted to point out that when you see information that is missing or incorrect in the main entry (like what insurance they accept), feel free to hit the Edit icon and add the information to the main entry directly.  All content on this entire site was written by people just like you, everybody adding just a little more or correcting something.  It is entirely community generated content, and youre a full editor here, just like everybody else.  So feel free to add information if you see something that needs to be added.  And once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081216 15:47:36 nbsp Oh, and by the way, there are a handful of forms of unethical activities on the wiki, and pointing them out is pretty common.  You are certainly not the only one who tags such reviews.  The ones you found sound like either sockpuppets (one person creating several accounts to look like several people) or Wiki Community/Reputation one shot reviews. Users/JabberWokky

20081216 23:58:33 nbsp Dr. Wang, I added stuff to the talk page. That is an appropriate way of dealing with this. I really believe the comments page should be left about businesses. Now when I used to own my restaurant in Davis, I would receive negative comments and accepted them; however in this case I believe you should seriously leave the comments section for stuff that is related to the business be it positive or negative not other wiki users.
