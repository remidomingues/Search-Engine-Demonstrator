Howdy Dr X, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for all the edits recently. I agree with you about pizza (I also like the Chicago style pies, but thats an actual different kind of food).  I just tell people I dont like pizza.  Ill eat it without complaint in group settings if it is the only thing available, but otherwise, I dont think Ive ever really ordered a pizza for myself in years.  Made them at home, yes.  Gone along with others, yes.  Ordered for my own pleasure, no.  The crust is never right, and I dislike how sweet most of the tomato sauces are.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
