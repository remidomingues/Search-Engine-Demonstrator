 Overview 

Covell Village is a proposal to convert a ~400 acre plot of land north of East Covell Boulevard, between Pole Line Road and F Street, into residential and commercial sites.  As per Measure J, which mandiates a citizen vote on any project that requires annexation of agricultural land into the city, the development requires a vote by the community.  The baseline propossal for the development cannot change without another vote by the people. However, changes outside of the scope of the baseline may occur without a vote, with approval from the City of Davis Planning Department or City Council. In July of 2004, the City Council voted 41 (with Sue Greenwald voting No) to approve the Covell Village project.  The Covell Village proposal appeared on the November 2005 Yolo County Election November 2005 Yolo County ballot as Measure X and failed with 59.9% No to 40.0% Yes.

For specifics of the project, see the City of Davis http://www.city.davis.ca.us/covell/pdfs/DirApplicantsProjectBaselinne.pdf summary as well as the http://www.yoloelections.org/election_central/voter_guide/20041102/AL1129841148/Measure%20X.pdf actual baseline that will be on the ballot.

The Covell Village proposal spawned a lively and sometimes nasty campaign.

 History of the project 
The Covell Village applications were approved by the City Council in June 2005. The Covell Village applications are the first submitted to the voters under the requirements of Measure J, the Citizens  Right to Vote on Future Use of Open Space and Agricultural Lands Ordinance. The Measure J election, which requires a majority vote, will determine whether the Councils approval of the Covell Village applications will go into effect. Ref. Davis Focus Newsletter Fall 2005

 Development plan 
The development would be placed on an agricultural site between Pole Line Road Pole Line and F Street F St. and would include mixed types of residential housing as well as commercial sites. There will be 1,864 housing units in total, built over 17 years.  The development is planned to have a new urbanism design.


 Housing prices 

Marketpriced Housing: 750 ownership units, including 150 senior only homes. 24 cohousing townhouses, 34 worklive units, 262 market apartments, including 50 in the Village Center. Some of these units may be built as condominiums or coverted after construction

Affordable Housing:  244 apartments for lowincome households (currently up to $48,000 per year). 21 of the units will be reserved for clients of the Yolo Community Care Continuum.

150 homes for purchase by moderateincome households (currently $48,320 to $72,480 for a fourperson household).

400 homes for middle income households. The middleincome units will have four tiers of 100 units each.  The lowest tier will be targeted to household with incomes up to $80,500 per year, with a purchase price not to exceed $342,000.  The highest tier will be targeted to households with incomes up to $119,600 per year, with a purchase price not to exceed $614,000.

All of these income limits and purchase prices will be adjusted to reflect local incomes at the time the homes are soldFootnote(Davis Focus Newsletter Fall 2005).

Note: these homes will be built at a rate of 150 homes per year total. The report did not state which type of units would be built each year over 17 years.)

 Environmental impact 

 Traffic and Roadways 
The EIR identified impacts to the following intersections: Covell & Pole Line, Covell & L Street, Pole Line & Picasso, Pole Line & Donner, Pole Line & Moore Blvd. (intersections directly adjacent to the project. ed.) All of these intersection impacts would be mitigated as a requirement of the project approvals.

The EIR identified impacts to the following roadway segments: Pole Line south of Covell, Covell between F & Pole Line, Pole Line between Covell and Moore.  Impacts to Covell and parts of Pole Line Road would not be mitigated.

 Water, stormwater 

Water for the development would primarily come from one or two new deepaquifer wells to be drilled on the site.BR

Portions of the project site are within the 100year floodplain.  Construction in these areas will require improved storm drainage channels and elevation of the building pads to a height above the base flood elevation Ref: Davis Focus Newsletter Fall 2005
