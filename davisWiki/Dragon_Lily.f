Dragon Lilies or Viagra Lilies are in the arum family Dracunculus vulgaris, like Tabatha the Titan, and can be grown outdoors in Davis. It takes some patience to grow these stinky beauties, however, because conditions are fairly specific and it can take ten years unless you happen to have just the right microclimate where youve lovingly placed your little stinkbulb. This rather bizarre plant may do nothing more than produce some interesting foliage for several years before actually blossoming  and then it will produce only a single blossom on the plant during any blooming season. The blossom, in reality, is a spathe. As it unfurls, it reveals a slender, black center appendage, known as the spadix, which can be between 1053 long. Hundreds of actual flowers, both male and female, are hidden deep inside the spathe, which features a bulbous chamber. Like the Titan arums living in UC Davis Botanical Conservatory, the dragon lily relies on Town Wildlife flies and other insects for pollination, and therefore emits a putrid dung and carrionlike smell, to attract them.

The arum family also counts among its members Calla Lily calla lilies, skunk cabbage, jack in the pulpit, and voodoo lilies. To see what other plants grow around town, please visit our Town Flora page.
