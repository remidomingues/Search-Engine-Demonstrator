Drake Drive is a quiet residential street in Central Davis.   It is part of the college streets in the town street name themes.  Apartment complexes on the street include The Drake and Redwood Grove. University Estates are located all along south Drake. Also, the Unitrans B Bus line runs on a portion of the street. It starts at Apple Lane, crosses Sycamore Lane and makes a loop to end back at Sycamore Lane. At one time the B Bus line BLine ran the entire length of Drake. The street forms sort of a letter J or fishhook with south drake forming the barb and north drake east of Sycamore forming the loop for the fishing line. North Drake is the last street to intersect Sycamore before Covell Boulevard Covell going north.
