One of your fellow Davisites, Sue, and her pup, Ellie Mae, were a national finalist to win a $500,000 dream dog park for the city of Davis in 2011.  Info on Sues dog park is still preserved at the http://www.wagworld.com/DreamDogPark/Finalists2011/Entry/Default.aspx?id891&og Beneful Dream Dog Park website, although someone in Birmingham, AL, ended up winning.
