Dreamers Ball was a Changeling LARP (Live Action Roleplaying Games Role Play) that mets every other Friday around Wellman Hall, usually in The Pit.  Because of the meeting place and time, they essentially fell under the jurisdiction of DRAGON.

From the http://www.dreamersball.com Dreamers Ball website: A small town on the Central Coast California coast, just south of Monterey Bay, Turtle Cove is a thriving artist community. The Seelie Changelings of the Fire Islands Barony who call this town home struggle against banality as they try to protect their fading world.

In English, its a group of people acting out characters of their own making: modernday fairies trying to survive in a world full of banality (the dullness of everyday life, so to speak). It runs on Minds Eye Theatre, which uses RockPaperScissors (so all you need to play is some imagination). New players are always welcome, and rules can be taught as the game is learned firsthand.

Changeling: The Dreaming
The gates to Arcadia, the original paradise, are closed. Only the world of humanity remains. Without any awareness of our true nature, humankind crushes us beneath its banal heel. Joy and laughter are gone; only the Dreaming remains.

We are changelings, the forgotten ones, neither fully fae nor wholly mortal. The last of our kind on Earth, we have built ourselves an invisible kingdom. We are everywhere, yet you have never seen us. We hide, not behind some fragile Masquerade, but in plain sight, with the power of our Glamour. We exist within a real world of makebelieve where imaginary things can kill, and pretend monsters are real.
