Drinking games are Games games that involve the act of drinking.  Some, such as the universal drinking game, are simple.  Others are complicated and pressing.  While drinking games can be fun, they can also be dangerous  excessive, binge drinking is never a good idea.  Be safe and responsible in your drinking.
