There is a Plethora vs. Dearth In Davis dearth of drum circles in Davis, although a few periodic ones exists:

  The Whole Earth Festival usually has at least one drum circle.
  The Davis Mens Community Talk & Drum Circle occurs monthly and provides a safe space for men to talk and learn from each other.

A oneoff gathering is planned for Friday, March 1st in the T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove Arboretum Redwood Grove.  Bring a drum.  Music starts around 6:30.
