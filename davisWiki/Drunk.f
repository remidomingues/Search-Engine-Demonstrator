Alcohol does strange things to men and women in sufficient quantities. Both happy drunks (call everyone on their cellphone) and belligerent drunks (aka: belligidrunks, attempt to start fights) are equally annoying. However, funny drunks (say and do funny things) are the best of the lot.  wiki:WikiPedia:Dipsomania Dipsomania and college towns go hand in hand.

By now we have all seen the 0  3 at UCD 03 at UCD slogan. Those numbers are questionable taking into account the context (UCD). First many people dont even touch Alcohol. Second, at many large parties getting more than three drinks is impossible unless you bring your own emergency stash like I do. Lastly, there are so many lightweights at Davis 3 drinks is all many people need to get pickled! I dont believe this 03 nonsense. What would be more constructive would be to see how many drinks a person would drink if they had the choice.  Users/ErnBro

Further complicating things is that the 03 system only counts bottled/canned beers, not kegs, and not hard liquor. Users/GeoffJohnson

  Maybe Drunk and Alcohol should be merged together in to Drinking?  Users/JackHaskel

03 system can count liquor.  1.5 ounce shot  12 ounces of beer (or a cup)  glass of wine (i believe).  Also, if most people dont drink, that would probably count for the 0 in 03.  Interesting because when my friends and I party we drink at least 10 shots... so i thought the 03 thing was too little. ) Users/BrianYum
