A Drunk Tank is where you go when you are detained for public drunk drunkenness. If you are picked up for being too drunk in Davis, you are taken to the Yolo County Jail in Woodland.  Though a night in the drunk tank may make for some memorable college shenanigans (if you can remember it at all), it is generally a situation which you should try to avoid.
