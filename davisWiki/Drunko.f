Drunko is a Drinking Games drinking game.

 Supplies 
A deck of Uno cards
Youll need a basic mixed drink for the players as well as something for shots.

 Rules 
Playing rules are taken from Uno with a few modifications

 Modified Uno Rules 
  You may take cards from the draw pile before taking your turn even if you have playable cards in your hand.
  When a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four is played, you may shift the draw to someone else with the use of a Wild Draw Four or the legal use of a Draw Two or Reverse (following the rules of playing the same color or same card).  The draw count increases with each subsequent Draw card.
   The player before you plays a Wild Draw Four and calls “Red”.  You can play a red Reverse and send it back at the 1st player or play a red Draw Two or a Wild Draw Four and send it on to the next person who has to pass it to someone else or draw six cards.
   If previous player played a blue Draw Two, your options would be to play any Draw Two, a blue Reverse or a Wild Draw Four.
