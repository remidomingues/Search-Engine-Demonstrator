Dry ice, actually solid CO2, can be obtained locally at:
  Food 4 Less  At the entrance.  As of February 2008, it was $0.95/lb.
  Savemart  At the western entrance.  As of June 2008, it was $1.29/lb.
  Campus  But only if you work in a lab.

Dont touch dry ice with your bare skin; it burns.

Dry ice may be very useful for:
  Spooky effects on Halloween.  Place some dry ice and water in a cauldron and eerie clouds of steam will bellow forth.  When the water gets too cold, it will stop as the dry ice becomes encased in solid water.
  Keeping things like drinks cold.
  Making unusual noises by forcefully pressing the convex side of a spoon onto the surface of the ice.
  Making cold things like ice cream.  Put the dry ice on top of the ice cream, not below, ideally with some thin cardboard in between.  A little goes a long way  too much, and your ice cream will be rock hard.
  Making small explosions by placing some dry ice and water in a sealed soda bottle.  NOTE: Dangerous and a Felony under http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/dwcl/12301.php 12301(a)(6).
   If you ever wish to do this, use thin plastic coke bottles rather than glass or thicker plastics which may form projectile shards. ~DavidPoole
  Using a rotary evaporator.. but only if you are working in a lab.

I would like to note that dry ice is fairly easy to acquire from the chemistry building stock rooms for 124L inorganic chemistry classes; however doing so would be quite unlawful and if you are going that far anyway you might as well get liquid nitrogen. ~Users/DavidPoole
