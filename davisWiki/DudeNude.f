This mysterious person has never created a personal page, but seems to be very active on the food related pages.  Very against fast food, the fellow strongly supports the Coop.  Does not have a problem with being rude and/or offensive while making his/her highly opinionated comments.

I bet DudeNude smells like onions.

Yeah, Onions!!!  I have smelled these persons that smell like onions...it seem the smell gets trapped in the hair and I can smell it if Im sitting behind someone in class that has that certain odor...not completely offensive but rather pungent.   I have shopped at the COOP


It is fortunate for you that you can make comments and still stay totally anonymous. Personal pages are off limits, comment if you must.  Users/SteveOstrowski
