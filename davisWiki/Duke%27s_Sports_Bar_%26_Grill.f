Dukes Sports Bar & Grill replaced Fusions Asian Bistro in fall 2005.

They had a full bar, plus drink specials ThuSat 9:00PMclose, and also after school specials 2:00PM6:00PM. There were TVs all around, like it or not. The place had a warm brown decor, thanks to the wood used throughout. The tables and chairs were all wood. It was nice and clean. They served Davis tap water.

Drink specials:
  Monday: Football Special: $5 domestic pitchers
  Thursday: $2 wells
  Friday: Ladies night: Free shooters
  Saturday: $2 wells
  Sunday: NFL Sunday opens at 10AM.

Trivia Night every Sunday night started at 9:30pm.


Dukes was shut down/evicted in late December 2006.  Apparently, they violated their lease by staying open later than midnight.  The owners have no plans of relocating or reopening the business.


Went to this place the other night and had the footlong hotdog with garlic fries. It was great and really reasonable. Dukes also has a great happy hour from 26pm. Users/SuperRedhead

20051208 12:55:00 nbsp I went there with my fiance because the davis wiki had good reviews. Basically, the place pissed me off so much I am writing this right now. I got fish and chips which were cold on the inside and chewy all through. The fries, though, were good. I told the waitress about the fish and she promptly (5 minutes) told the cook to make some more. In about 510 more minutes, I got more fish. This time, they were crunchy, but only because they were still mostly frozen. I told her again and this time she got the manager. I stepped aside as the manager inspected my food. The manager never approached me, but the waitress came and gave me $5 off of the $11 plate. The fries were good, but not $6 dollars good. I left no tip, but I did write that the fish and chips charge should go to our waitress who was nice after all. I also wrote on the receipt that I would put this on the Davis Wiki: PLEASE DONT GO TO DUKES. I realize that it wasnt that bad, and the atmosphere was actually quite nice, but please, choose somewhere else. Users/DanielDeisenroth

20060303 15:55:11 nbsp I went to Dukes today to check it out and have some lunch.  I was seated at a tabel that looked into the kitchen.  After I placed my order, I glanced over at the kitchen and noticed that the cook wiped his nose with his hand, and then continued to prepare the food orders.  I kept watching, and he repeatedly wiped his nose with his fingers and hand.  I became totally grossed out, cancelled my order, and promptly left.  Users/TiffanySnell

20060304 00:19:29 nbsp does dukes have a cabana, canoe club theme? theres an awesome bar & grill on wakiki beach with the same title Users/MichelleAccurso

20060403 16:51:08 nbsp The spinach and artichoke dip is really bland.  I never thought Id ever say that cheese was tasteless, but it was.  Ever heard of salt and pepper?  For the price for any price I shouldve gotten more than just a handful of chips. Users/JennaChan

20060404 19:48:01 nbsp Um, the service at this joint is the worst ive ever seen. The girls drinking there cant be older than 15. How is this place still surviving with the owners constantly intoxicated ? No one washes their hands, there are no rules to be followed. This place is a disgrace to the davis community. I hope somebody realizes the illiegal behavior that is allowed every evening and shuts this dump down. Yeah, im not a big fan. Pukes.  Users/ElandEa

20060501 11:45:26 nbsp wost restaurant in davis ever.the owners are douche bags...they have no idea what they are doing.should this place be shut down???ABSOLUTELY!! Users/ElandEa

20060809 22:32:53 nbsp I remember the first time I went to Dukes, the food was damn good. The burger came with thick pieces of bacon, large wedges of avocado, and the burger was thick and juicy. It came with a delectable side of fries tossed with garlic and flat leaf parsely. This was samsara, nirvana, and heaven all on a plate.

But what happened? Apparently over an eight month period, things just fell down the slippery slope. Sports bars are supposed to have awesome food, good cheap beer spilling over the pitchers, and a game on the screen. Well, two out of three aint bad. And honestly, the food isnt bad after a few drinks or with a beer, but on its own it lacks that Americana gusto bar food should have the quality of.

Rob and I went down for a quick bite to eat. I had the pork ribs, and Rob had the skirt steak. Both came with the general vegetable medly you expect at a steakhouse, they were good, they were vegetables. Nothing more. The garlic fries this time were dissapointing, Robs were only just warm, and both of ours had the garlic burnt. I do believe they tossed the fries with the garlic first, then cooked them. Bleh.

The ribs were meaty though a bit too wet, and covered in general BBQ sauce. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to put down either; all in all they were good. Robs steak however, I must admit was damn fine. Damn fine! We were both genuinely surprised. I tried to steal some from Rob, but the bastard kept shooing me away, and wasnt falling for the, Hey, look over there! routine.

We also ordered some spinach dip before hand. Skip this one. Its the very definition of bland. I even took the time to write on the check that it needed garlic and tobasco, an action I would normally deem rude, but the fact that they had the nerve to serve it was license enough. I was even shocked that I did that, but then again, I doubt that Judy Rodgers is heading up the kitchen rather than some frat boy with a part time job over a stove. Im sure the note was ignored.

The burgers there are still pretty good, but you can do better at the Grad in Davis, or Hamburger Marys in downtown Sac. If you want a sports bar with sports bar food, Dukes will do the job. Basically stick to the lunch menu, but ignore dinner. And get a pitcher, regardless what you think of Dukes, a pitcher makes everything better. Users/ProtoGarrett

20061003 11:59:59 nbsp Make sure you have Andrea make you an EctoKaze if you go here (:

20061015 17:37:40 nbsp Ate here last night with friends around 8pm. The place was completely empty and the service was slow. My friend and I both ordered nachos, both were cold when we got them. We sent them back to be heated up and they came back the same temperature. My friends nachos had uncooked beans and later got a stomach ache. This place has mediocre food at best. I dont recommend going there for the food. Users/EmmyMelton

20070123 21:24:07 nbsp RIP my dear friend.  Ill never forget you or all the wonderful Sundays spent here.  Watching football will never be the same for me again.  Youll be missed dear friend Users/RussellAnderson
