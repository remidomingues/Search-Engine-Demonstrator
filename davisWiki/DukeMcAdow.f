Image(imageDukeMcAdow.jpg, right, thumbnail) Duke McAdow moved to Northern California from Southern California Los Angeles in 2001 because he had grown tired of life in the big city.

He works at UC Davis solely to keep his two cats supplied with the expensive food, toys, scratchers and plush beds they demand.  Although he moved to Davis from Woodland in 2007, his cats insist he continue to take them to their http://www.woodlandwiki.org/Animal_Care_Clinic_of_Woodland preferred veterinary office back in Woodland.

He enjoys bicycling (hes the guy on the slowmoving, limegreen, 1989 Cannondale).  He took up golf in 2010, and frequents the Davis Golf Course and http://www.woodlandwiki.org/Mountain_Valley_Golf_Course Mountain Valley Golf Course in Woodland, where they are extremely tolerant of his I meant to do that playing style.

He was born in http://haw.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawai%E2%80%98i Hawaii, and raised in Hawaii and wiki:WikiPedia:California California.  Frequently asked: Duke is his given name...he was named after wiki:WikiPedia:Duke_Kahanamoku another Hawaiian named Duke.
