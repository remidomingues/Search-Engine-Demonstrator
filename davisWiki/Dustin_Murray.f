Candidate Statement

Hello my name is Dustin Murray and I am a First Year Student who wishes to serve as a representative and voice for the students of UC Davis. The goal of my Campaign is to understand what the students of UCD would like to see changed on the Campus as well as encourage you to understand and vote in the upcoming ASUCD elections. I am therefore running as an independent. It is my sincere hope that you choose to use me as your voice in this outstanding university. Though I understand many people find this election to be merely a popularity contest, I do not seek this office to become popular, I seek it to become useful as a student representative for you. Please share the changes or improvements you wish to see and I will do my best to voice them. I strongly believe I can offer points of view and opinions from a freshmens perspective.
I have 6 years of student government experience as an ASB President, Junior Class Vice President, and a School District Committee Representative for Budget and Student Attendance Boundary Committees. I am also an Eagle Scout, was awarded the Junior Statesman of Americaâ€™s Best Speaker Award for Debate, and was a member of the National Honor Society and California Scholarship Federation.
I would like to serve you, the students of UC Davis, but I can only do so if am given the opportunity, so I humbly ask for your vote. Thank You and God bless you.
