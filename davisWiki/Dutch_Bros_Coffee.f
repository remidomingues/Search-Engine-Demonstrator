Dutch Bros. took over the Caffino kiosk, becoming Central Daviss only option for drivethru Coffee coffee, the other in town being the Starbucks in West Davis. The new kiosk was under construction for months, it was completed late November 2012. They redid the top of the kiosk into the signature blue, and added overhangs. There are two Dutch Bros. locations in Woodland.

For Fathers Day 2013 (June 16), Woodland and Davis locations will be donating all proceeds to help 8 year old JT Davis battle against Gauchers Disease, a rare blood disease. The funds you help us raise will help the Davis family cover the annual $187,000 treatments.

20121130 16:39:59 nbsp Free coffees of any kind all day today.  At 6:30am there was no wait, at 11am it was backed up like 30 cars. The coffee was excellent and so smooth compared to the other options available in town.  Very happy that Dutch Bros, has come to Davis.  The staff was way excited and pumped up.   Users/loneshark

20121201 10:34:35 nbsp The lines were so long at 6 pm that they were causing traffic jams! Id say it was a successful promotion. Users/DonShor

20121211 13:53:56 nbsp I must admit that I was skeptical at first, but Dutch Brothers seems to be a great fit for Davis.  Their coffee drinks are great because they dont overdo it on the sugar; their business is great because they have lots of specials and they give punch cards!  Theyre also Daviss only 24hour coffee stop. Users/Michi
