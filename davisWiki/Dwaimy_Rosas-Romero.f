 Candidate Statement 
My name is Dwaimy RosasRomero and I’m a 3rd year student with a double major in Psychology and Women and Gender Studies and a minor in African American and African Studies African American Studies.  Over the past eight years in Davis I have developed a concern in addressing issues involving underrepresented communities.  I have worked collaboratively with the Davis Asians for Racial Equality and the Davis Human Relations Commission in holding community forums in which students, parents, and members of the Davis community voiced personal accounts of discrimination.  Furthermore, as a representative to the Davis School Board I brought attention to the issues of diversity and community within the School District.  Additionally, for two consecutive years I facilitated small discussion groups in the Friendship Day program at Davis Sr. High School with the goal of dismantling stereotypes, prejudices, and erroneous perceptions among students.

As a current UC Davis campus leader and senate candidate my major concerns are diversifying the UC Davis Faculty by seeking the aid and support of the Academic Affairs Commission, the Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission, the Campus Council on Community and Diversity, the Academic Senate, and the heads of the Ethnic Studies departments in ensuring a diverse pool of applicants and increasing the retention rate among faculty of underrepresented backgrounds.  I would also like to ensure that the fulfillment of the Diversity Requirement in fact educates and brings awareness to students about the social, political, and economic misrepresentations and injustices experienced by minorities.  Not only would I like to see UC Davis students graduate with an increased understanding of people from different ethnicities, genders, and sexualities, but to become aware of the valuable contributions they have made to this society.
