Whats up party people?



Do I ever work?

Only when Im not motivation to spend the days lollygagging in the California sun at the intersection of Marijuana Weed Circle and Alcohol Saki Street.  Mostly I choose to spend my days acting out a role called Owner that lends itself to the delegation of responsibility to junior executive misfits, the pursuit of fresh mowed greens and the endless search for a good wave on company time.  I have been known to do my share of work when called upon but my focus remains clear.  Enjoy the ride, you never know when you have to get off abruptly.
