  APRS and other HAM radio things (any other hams in Davis want to start a club?)
  working on his research
  soil science education and outreach


Your sign map is an awesome idea!  You need to get on it this weekend and map out further!

Thanks! Dylan

Dylan, a few months ago you posted on the lugod mailing list asking if people would be interested in a GRASS users group. Did anything ever come of this? I would be interested. Also, I have some questions about getting California maps that maybe you can answer. Email me at nschmalenberger at fastmail.fm . Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20051106 18:48:32 nbsp The sign map is cool! Did you do it using GPS, or did you keep a text list, or annotate a map you carried, or ? (Now, could GRASS help with it?) Users/SteveDavison

20051123 09:20:03 nbsp Thanks. actually I collected the data with a little GPS, while riding my bike. I kept track of yes/no in a note pad. Then I dumped the GPS locations to a text file and added the yes/no data. GRASS was used to convert this text file into a vector dataset that I could then overlay with other things like the aerial photo and bike trail. Users/DylanBeaudette  NICE!  Users/rocksanddirt

20071112 17:11:26 nbsp That elevation map was cool.  I always figured Davis had a slight slope to it.  Users/EdWins

20080305 10:16:36 nbsp Hi Dylan, Im just responding to your comment on the La Buena Vida page. Whether HOAs serve a purpose or not in individually owned neighborhoods is a separate issue, but how would you suggest common property be managed in a development such as this? Users/MattCzarnowski
