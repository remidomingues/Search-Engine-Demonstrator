Dynamics Hair & Massage Studio also offers the best in Eastern & Western therapeutic massage in several modalities. Our studio has 2 massage rooms, 2 therapists, and plenty of massage availability.

Heather Watne offers integrative massage that incorporates Barefoot Shiatsu (Ashiatsu), Acupressure, Thai, Reflexology, Reiki, Polarity therapy and Craniosacral bodywork. Clients receive massage with loose clothing on, on a comfortable floor futon or massage table. Treatments utilizing the acupressure meridians are both relaxing and energizing. Easternstyle table massage is also available; some clients prefer acupressure oil massage (clothes off, draped with sheets), while others prefer lighter acupressure work with clothes on. Acupressure is similar to acupuncture, but no needles are used (only finger pressure) to move the bodys energy. Polarity therapy helps to balance the bodys electromagnetic field, encouraging the flow of energy through all systems so the body can selfcorrect when imbalances occur (such as illness, weakened immune defenses, fatigue, tension, stress, etc.). Craniosacral bodywork is subtle work which helps ease tension in the nervous system, helping you to deeply relax, and correcting spinal, skull or sacral misalignments at a deep level; sometimes before they can manifest as pain in the body.

Melissa August specializes in Pregnancy & Postpartum massage, and also offers relaxing Swedish, energizing sports massage, and hot stone massage on a comfortable automatic lift massage table. Melissas table will allow the recipient to sit up, (helpful for Pregnancy massage) and is extrasturdy to help you feel safe & secure while relaxing fully. Melissas sessions are relaxing and rejuvenating. For new mothers, Postpartum massage means coming in to receive a relaxing massage, and also having the option to bring the new baby along, as it isnt always easy to leave the new little one, or find someone to watch him or her. Melissa also offers instruction in infant massage for new parents. Ask Melissa for details.

Dynamics also offers portable chair massage, either onsite, or at your location. Available for the Holidays or just as a treat for yourself or your coworkers....ask for details!

20070512 13:18:06 nbsp I just got a massage from Melissa and it was wonderful! I was a little unsure after not seeing any comments here, but the ability to book the appointment online was what encouraged me to check this place out. Melissa asked good questions to see what kind of massage I was looking for and made me very comfortable. She was professional and her technique was amazing. I dont think Ive had any better massage before. Highly recommended! Users/AdrienneW

20080402 nbsp I went to Melissa with severe back pain and Sciatica in my right leg that eventually caused numbness in my foot and lower calf.  When my physical therapist and doctor said that there was nothing that I could do until I felt better, Melissa was able to give me some relief as I healed.  She has a deal on multiple massages and you can easily make an appointment online.  She really has a sense for finding your tight spots and tailors her work to suit your needs she does NOT just go through the motions!  When my whole body was tense and compensating for my back, she was able to give me both some immediate release, but I also found that I continued to loosen up as a day or two went by.  If you need either a stress reduction or if you are suffering from some sort of physical pain like me, I highly recommend contacting Melissa.  Users/smjameso

20080715 23:17:03 nbsp Dynamics has, hands down, the most welcome and warm atmosphere in town. Great people, great services. I get my hair cut and colored by Susan and massages from Heather, both are tremendously talented! Users/davismom12

20080821 21:43:34 nbsp I go to Melissa whenever I need a massage.  Her technique is amazing.  After my latest massage, I felt more relaxed than I ever remember being.  My husband goes to see Melissa as well and adores her. Users/LeslieMadsenBrooks

20081123 14:41:50 nbsp My haircut from Sue was great! Highly recommend. The website is very convenient, too! Users/yadayada

20090130 16:18:22 nbsp I highly recommend a massage with Melissa. She was fantastic at listening and adjusting to what I wanted. The atmosphere was great as well (super soft sheets and a fountain). Ive tried a few places around Davis and this was definitely my favorite  and actually one of the best massages Ive had anywhere.  Users/jlw

20090416 11:50:47 nbsp I love going here!  both to have my hair cut/colored and to have a massage, I have never been disappointed in the friendly customer service provided and I have been visiting these ladies for about 6 years now. Users/RebeccaDetrick

20090611 12:28:27 nbsp Jennie is great! She did a lovely job highlighting my hair and is very cool and easy to talk to. I went there because It was the most inexpensive place in Davis for a partial highlight, but my hair turned out perfect and I ended up saving some money in the process. I will definately go there next time :) Users/rnavarro1988

20090811 16:20:51 nbsp Heather Watne is AMAZING!  She is a caring, nurturing massage therapist who knows exactly what to do to make your pain go away.  Ive had several massages from her over the years, and I cant say any two have been the same.  The reason for that is that Heather takes the time to find out whats going on with my body before she starts work, and adjusts her techniques based on my needs.  Shes a healer, and she never watches the clock.  I cant recommend her enough.  Users/NDS1111

20100123 21:16:02 nbsp Jennie was great! She totally understands ethnic hair, especially mixed hair (interracial) and she saved me from getting a bad haircut. Instead she created one that fit me and it is soooo cute! Plus she is really easy to talk to. Dynamics is a must! Users/underhiswingsdw18

20100521 11:47:57 nbsp 2010 520 I have been going to Melissa for about 6 months and she is absolutely wonderful. My stress level is very high from work and personal issues and I have a lot of pain in my neck and upper shoulder area. She has the most amazing hands and is able to relax me and I feel like rubber when I leave. On top of that, she is one of the nicest, most caring people you will ever meet and listens to your needs. She offers a wide range of massages and times and adjusts her massage to each clients needs. I highly recommend Melissa and once you have a massage by her you will be coming back for more. She has a great online appointment system so you can easily make that next appointment and you wont be disappointed. ChrisC Users/Cchase

20100611 10:36:32 nbsp Melissa is fantastic! Super personable, and you can tell she really cares about her clients. Great massage, takes the time to make sure you are relaxed and she isnt pressing too hard/light. Definitely worth your money! Shes starting to work more hours now, and is starting evenings in July.   Users/ajrap

20100707 19:00:17 nbsp I woke up with very sore shoulders after an intense workout the previous day and called Melissa on her cell phone to schedule a massage after reviewing her website (http://www.melsmassagedavis.com). Melissa was very welcoming and professional. She asked good questions and recommended a combination of techniques, including deep tissue and stretching, to ease my shoulder pain. Her studio is very clean, welldecorated, and comfortable. I even liked the music. Melissa is an excellent massage therapist. She’s also very attentive. Melissa asked for feedback several times to make sure the pressure was just right and the stretching wasn’t causing pain. At the end I was very relaxed and almost fell asleep. It was a great massage.

20101110 08:59:32 nbsp I would highly recommend Melissa as a massage therapist. I started running last year and have noticed a huge difference in recovery time after getting a Sports Massage from her. She listens to you and takes the time to understand your specific issue and/or needs. I will not go to anyone else because she is the best. I met her at the 2009 Turkey Trot and have been hooked since then. She is caring, patient and gives the absolute BEST massages. Try her and you will agree!  Users/Arlene

20110731 17:49:51 nbsp I highly recommend Heather for eastern style bodywork/massage. I initially started going to her two years ago for acupressure work to help with migraines. Ive discovered that eastern style massage is a better fit for my personality and body than western style. Over time Ive had a variety of different massages with her. Depending on what type of work I need each session, Heather incorporates a variety of techniques (acupressure, reflexology, cranial work, etc) into the sessions. She has wonderful positive energy and does a good job. Specifically over the past two years she has helped my shoulders, neck, and head immensely. Im please to have found such a good masseur who is always filled with ideas and suggestions for work I can do at home to help improve my overall wellbeing. Users/AnnaD

20111230 21:00:05 nbsp I just got a Wonderful hair cut here by Maria. She is Fantastic! She listens to what you want done, as well as helps you decide on a good style. I was nervous to cut my hair but she helped me come up with a great solution. She is very talented, and knows what she is doing. She also kept me very entertained throughout the appointment, which I love rather then sitting in silence for an hour. She also gave me a great deal, so for those of you living on a college budget like me and cant afford a professional hair cut, Maria is your girl. Just tell her you heard about a discount she gave a another student and she she will hook you up! Best Hair salon in Davis, I would go any place else! Users/Annashumaker

20140217 12:19:25 nbsp Melissa is a phenomenal massage therapist. I see her twice a month for sports massage and I am in utter awe of her skill and effectiveness. She knows precisely the level of force to apply for overworked muscles but will always stop short of creating any discomfort. Her sensitivity to the need of each muscle group means she can be incredibly soothing and gentle one moment, but aggressive and bold the next. An added plus: Melissa is an extremely pleasant and engaging person; it is obvious she loves her work.  I would give her six stars if it were possible! Users/Nancymarie

20140221 09:43:53 nbsp Melissa is a fantastic massage therapist! The first time I went to her, I told her about a painful spot in my back that had been bothering me for a long time. During the massage, she focused on that spot, but also massaged the rest of my body. After the massage, it was sore for a few hours, but the next day the pain disappeared, and it never came back!! Her relaxation massages and pregnancy massages are always wonderful. She is very sensitive to the clients needs, and checks in with you during the massage about whether the pressure is too firm or too light. She also has excellent customer service. If the massage starts a few minutes late (even if its your fault), she asks if youre able to stay a few minutes past the scheduled time so that she can still give you the full massage time. This is the opposite of the terrible customer service Ive gotten at Massage Envy. Dont wait  call Melissa (or go online) today to schedule a massage! Users/xarcadia

20140416 22:54:05 nbsp I started getting pregnancy massages from Melissa in my third trimester after I started having significant sciatica pain.  After only two sessions, the pain was absolutely gone.  That was all it took to convince me that she was going to be key to helping me get through the pain and discomfort of my third trimester.  Ive ended up booking weekly appointments and it has helped me tremendously with lower back pain, swelling, and plantar fasciitis.  She always tailors my massages to focus on current trouble spots which is really beneficial.  If you are pregnant and feeling discomfort, book an appointment now!   Users/darcid4
