Also welcome to the wiki I would love to see you edit a page that isnt the ramble

20111111 21:06:53 nbsp 20111107 10:59:17   Welcome to the Wiki! Please take a moment to look over to the business owner/rep intro page. Removing other users contributions is kind of a nono around here. It looks like youre editing from Denver, CO. Am I right in guessing that means youre with Urban Villages? If so, thanks for taking an interest in the content on the wiki, but please be sure youre working within the wikis norms (see that intro page). â€”TomGarberson
