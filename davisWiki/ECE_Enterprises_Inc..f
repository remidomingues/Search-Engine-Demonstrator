20090326 13:54:50 nbsp I purchased a truck from Hogan last year. It was a very good value. Hogan was very easy to work with. If you are looking for an older car, Id definitely recommend this place. Id buy another vehicle from him without hesitation. Users/templets

20100203 22:08:59 nbsp whats happened to  the old web page of this dealer?

He is a very funny guy, with the most ridicules stories. He told me that he was an F4 phantom pilot, but he know nothing about phantoms . He told me that he is a car dealer, but when I visit him in 2008, and then after a year in 2009, I found the same inventory in his lot. look for the suzuki wagon its not moving since they open the place.

20100216 00:49:23 nbsp My fiancee came to visit me this three day (Valentines Day) weekend from Monterrey, and his car broke downtotally died here in Davis; so we went to Hogans.  Hogan knows everything about the cars on his lot.  He was very friendly, helpful and sensitive to our needs.  My fiancee and I walked there, but left in a Ford Probe GT 96.  I thought the prices in the lot were reasonable.  My fiancee got his car for a great deal.  He says it was worth the money he spent.  He loves his new car.  Iwe highly recommend this dealership!
