 Undergraduate Computer Labs 
All the http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/support/resources.html undergraduate computer labs have an HP Laserjet printer. An ECE account is needed to log on to any of the computers. The Computer Science CSIF labs are located in the basement. Over time there have been /old other labs.
  ECE Undergraduate Lab 1101/1105   40 Dell OptiPlex GX110 computers (Pentium 3 933MHz, 384MB RAM) running Red Hat Linux (kernel version 2.4.21). These machines are often used for SPICE and Matlab simulations.
   The printer used to be a good source of scratch paper because students would leave their cover pages lying around, but it no longer prints them.
  2107  24 Dell Precision 380s (3.0GHz P4s, 1GB RAM) with 19 LCDs. Until spring 2006, 2107 used to have the slowest machines (HP 9000 B132Ls) in ECE. As of May 2008, they are equipped with Nvidia 8800 GTS display cards.
  2110  21 Dell Precision 390s (Slimmer model of the 380) running Red Hat ES Linux 5.  This lab is mainly used by EEC180A.
  2112  11 Dell Precision 390s running WindowsXP. This room is used for EEC151/EEC172 and is locked when there is no class scheduled. These computers have National Instruments interfacing boards in them, although students keep on figuring out new ways to kill the boards.

 Undergraduate  Electronics Labs 
Each workstation in the http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/labs/index.html electronics labs generally has some combination of an oscilloscope, variable power supply, function generator, and multimeter. This equipment is also quite old.

Wire, resistors, capacitors, and other parts needed for labs are obtained from room 2162 only during scheduled lab sessions.
  2110  21 stations (used by EEC70, EEC180AB)
  2112  11 stations (used by EEC151, EEC172)
  2147  10 stations (used by EEC195AC)
  2151  6 stations (used by EEC194AC)
   This is the Micromouse lab. The maze is kept here.
  2155  13 stations (used by EEC112)
  2157  11 stations (used by ENG100, EEC100, EEC114, EEC118)
  2161  11 stations (used by ENG100, EEC100, EEC114, EEC118)
