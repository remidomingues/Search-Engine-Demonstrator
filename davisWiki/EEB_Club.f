EEB stands for Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. It is open to anyone interested in learning more about ecology and getting involved with ecological issues.


This EEB club goes on many field trips, which is an awesome way to meet new people and make great friends. In essence, it is the free outdoors club. Outdoor Adventures, costs money but provides more. They meet once a quarter (near the begining) and otherwise communicate through email.
