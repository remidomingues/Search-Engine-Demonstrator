Though earthquakes typically only result in minor cracks in Davis, the possibility exists that more extensive damage could occur. This gives Davisites something to talk about with relatives from the Davis Midwest Connection midwest.

Winters holds an Earthquake Street Festival on the the third Friday each August, which commemorates a magnitude 6.6 earthquake that shook the region at 3:15am on April 19, 1892. Every single brick and stone building in Winters was leveled either by this temblor or by another magnitude 6.4 quake which struck two days later on April 21.  These were both followed on April 29 by a magnitude 5.6 aftershock. Damage was reported as far away as Chico and Napa. One man, Jeff Darby, was struck in the head by a falling brick as he tried to escape, badly injuring him.  He died three days later.

The lack of impact on Davis scientists calls the actual relevance of this factoid into question, especially considering there are still plenty of places that prosecute http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchhunt#Modern_witchhunts witchcraft.

  Our couches felt like they shifted a bit, and the cord from the ceiling fans was swinging. Not a big deal, but definitely noticeable.  Users/CovertProfessor
