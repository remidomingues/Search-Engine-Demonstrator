The East is associated with the morning, and (oddly) things to the Asian far west of Davis.  Not to be confused with Easter.

To the East is West Sacramento (confused yet?) and Sacramento.  Keep going East on I80 from there, and you get to Reno with gambling and prostitution, which is associated with the American West.  Eventually youll get to Ocean City, MD, as indicated by the sign on I80 as you enter Sacramento.

There is also East Davis.
