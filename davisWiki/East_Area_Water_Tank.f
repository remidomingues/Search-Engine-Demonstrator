The East Area Water Tank is a fourmillion gallon water tank recently completed at 44085 County Road 32A by the City of Davis. It is visible from Ikedas and Mace Boulevard. The East Area Tank is similar in materials and dimensions to the West Area Water Tank north of Sutter Hospital. It is a concrete reservoir approximately 135 feet in diameter, about 32 feet high (with an additional 10 feet buried). The site also has a separate structure that houses the pumps and electrical system.  The purpose of the tank is to help with water pressure on the south and east sides of the city, as well as to help provide water during emergencies (fire, power loss, etc.).  During regular use, the tank will be left halffull.  Or, halfempty, depending on how you look at it.

Artist team Sofia Lacin and Hennessy Christophel of http://www.lcmuralanddesign.com/ LC Mural and Design were selected by the City of Davis to execute their design for the 4 million gallon water tank. They made a mural on the side of the tank, and grillwork around the top of the tank that casts shadows onto the side of the tank.  http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/city/daviswatertankart%E2%80%98shinesuponusall%E2%80%99/ According to the Davis Enterprise, the monument was named Public Works Project of the Year by the Sacramento Chapter of the American Public Works Association.

At the right time of year, around Summer Solstice, the white letters on the side of the tank combine with shadows from the grillwork on top to spell sol omnibus lucet, or as translated in smaller letters below, the sun shines upon us all.  Lacin and Christophel called the work Same Sun.  (See also the http://www.davistank.blogspot.com Water Tank Blog for other details.)

Bob Dunning has repeatedly alleged over the course of two years that the mural is a waste of money, but also recently stated, Ive been willing to wait until the solstice arrives before pronouncing final judgment...  Since the 2012 summer solstice, Dunning has said almost nothing about the water tank.




20110811 14:46:44 nbsp Am I the only one who thinks the water tank is ugly? I hope that the paint theyre putting on is just a base coat for a mural and its not staying this way... Users/jsbmeb

20110811 14:49:50 nbsp  Yes, agreed.  Badly in need of a paint job. Users/OldDavis73

20110811 15:22:25 nbsp Doh. Looks like this is and will be the mural. I should have read more in the description.  Users/jsbmeb
  Its not clear to me whether the job is done or not.  Dunning has suggested that it might be.  I am not sure.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111116 16:59:39 nbsp $75,000? Really!? well spent Davis! ...Or not. Thanks for the eyesore! Was this REALLY the best proposal given?
My son described the colors as a bloody body dragged through baby poop and I honestly think that sums it up PERFECTLY! Users/Antoinette

20120111 17:49:43 nbsp At certain times of the year the stickingoutbits at the top of the tank will throw shadows of letters that complete the wording on the tank.  Users/AnneHance

20120111 17:57:43 nbsp $75,000 for art? Great. Lacin and Christobel have public art all over Sacramento, from the Shady Lady Murals to East Sacramento Hardware and many more. I hope they evolve to challenge viewers more. A tightrope to walk for any artist, taking money and challenging viewers at the same time, but they have solid representational talent that does look ready to evolve in different directions. Users/ChristopherHitchens

20120112 11:47:57 nbsp So the mural is, well, a Davis mural.  And thats ok.  But the sculptural elements around the top just look like so much leftover construction trash. Users/JimStewart

20120112 14:30:57 nbsp I am clearly in a minority (so far) of wiki viewers in that I think the water tank art is a fine achievement. It could have been a commonorgarden painted sign but instead it is colorful and rather unique as a sort of sundial.  Perhaps if Lacin and Christobel had painted the sculptural elements too in some colorful way they would be seen as part of the overall effect. Users/AnneHance

20120117 16:41:01 nbsp Ive tried to suck it up and keep my mouth shut, but I cant.  The thing is ugly.  The sculptural elements look like so much construction trash.  I have a suggestion.  Next time the city has a need to paint concrete to greet people as they enter Davis, think Sunflowers.  Big, pretty sunflowers.  If I want art to challenge me, Ill go over to the Natsoulas Art Gallery and wander around confused.  I have enough on my mind driving 70 on Interstate 80. Users/JimStewart

20120303 20:04:20 nbsp I agree with what Users/AnneHance wrote...I think the mural is great!  Whenever I drive by on the freeway, it often looks as if its commingling with the sky and landscape.  I find the phrase they chose (Sol omnibus lucet/The sun shines on us all) uplifting whenever I see the mural or think of it.  I appreciate the amount of thought, care and effort the artists put into it, and Im glad they did something extraordinary. Users/DukeMcAdow

20120520 08:37:55 nbsp People snub artists payment for their work all the time. Honestly, if you thought you could do better and would do so for less you should have applied. Users/KBathory
 I did apply, I just dont think my Idea was creative enough in how I was going to waste the lions share of 100kDaubert

20120625 09:58:36 nbsp My opinion now aligns with Users/AnneHance: I think this is a fine achievement artistically. Users/DougWalter

20120625 10:03:28 nbsp While I can, and do, appreciate the piece, I also feel there were much better ways for the city to spend the funds. Users/WesP

20120830 13:37:05 nbsp Now that the artwork is finished, the water tank is another wonderful Davis icon.  Congratulations to the artists for doing a great job. Users/GregKuperberg
