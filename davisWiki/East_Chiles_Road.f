East Chiles Road/County Road 32b is an access road on the south side of I80.  It changes at its western end from Chiles Road at El Cemonte Avenue a block east of Mace Boulevard and goes to the Causeway Message Rocks at the Yolo Causeway levee, where it makes a left U turn under the freeway and becomes County Road 32a.

About a quarter mile before the levee is the Yolo Fruit Stand just before an I80 exit and entrance.
