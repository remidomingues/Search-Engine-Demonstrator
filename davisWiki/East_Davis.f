East Davis is http://www.chl.ucdavis.edu officially defined as north of I80, east of J Street and north of East 8th Street.  In other words, its everything north of I80 and east Of J Street except for the square bounded by East 8th, J Street, I80, and Pole Line. This square is part of Downtown Downtown Davis.

Informally, most people referring to East Davis are talking about anything east of the Train Tracks railroad tracks, and north of I80.  Bob Dunning likes to refer to the section of town immediately east of the tracks, south of Fifth, and ending at L Street as Olde East Davis while others call it The Peoples Republic of East Davis. That makes downtown the traditional square bounded by B to the west and H to the east, Fifth to the north, and First to the south. Historically, the actual downtown comprised G Street from Second to Fourth, and Second from F to G. The rest of the area between that and the university was primarily residential until during the 50s and 60s. Old East Davis is an area of Davis recognized by the city council, interested developers, and the Old East Davis Neighborhood Association. Additionally, theres a section of town recognized as Old North Davis History Old North Davis.

Many UCD Students students live in East Davis because of cheaper apartments and houses. Nonstudents (read: real adults) can afford more luxurious abodes, so they live in the Mace Ranch and Wildhorse developments. East Davis is also home to 5 schools: Korematsu School Korematsu Elementary School, Birch Lane School Birch Lane Elementary School, Holmes Junior High School, Harper Junior High School, and DaVinci High School.

Animal lovers are welcome too! The Toad Hollow Dog Park is a great place to take your furry best friend, or you can walk your pooch on the 3 The Greenbelt greenbelts. And theres a Burrowing Owl Reserve. Owls gotta live, man.
