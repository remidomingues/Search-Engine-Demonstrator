Its a library! In a box! Opened in April 2012, the East Davis Library in a Box is exactly that: An allweather wooden box with a rotating inventory of books donated and borrowed by community members and anyone who happens to be passing by.  The collection is varied and changes on a daily basis.  Selections include popular fiction, guidebooks and howtos, childrens books, coffee table books, graphic novels, classics, whodunnits, science fiction, fantasy, etc.  Anyone looking for their next book to read or with extra books they want to donate is welcome to come on by and check it out.  The instructions read: Borrow. Read. Return. Donate. Repeat.  And thats really all there is to it. As an added bonus, some patrons have started placing oneofakind bookmarks in the donations.  Those you can keep.
Open 24/7, including all holidays.

The East Davis Library in a Box is the first of two Little Free Library branches in Davis.  The second branch, the Central Davis Library in a Box was opened in July 2012 at the Davis Food Coop.

20120421 14:44:00 nbsp Definitely looking forward to visiting this library! Id recommend that people who donate write the name of the library on the inside book covers with a marker. Not only will this hopefully discourage resale, but it will also help people with large book collections remember that they dont actually  own the book. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120422 19:37:52 nbsp Nope, no relation to the ML Stevens branch or the Yolo Co. Public Library system.  Just a community library in a box! Users/JoaquinFeliciano

20120514 09:00:38 nbsp The library has been moved from its original location about 10 to the right and closer to the sidewalk to make it more prominent and accessible to foot traffic.  And, inevitably, dogs.  Its also been modified to make it easier to access the books inside. Users/JoaquinFeliciano
