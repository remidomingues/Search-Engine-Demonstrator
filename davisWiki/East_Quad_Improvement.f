Project #2 Construction Period July 5 through September 23, 2005

 Construction Zone was from the  Midblock crossing just north of the Quad northward to the intersection of East Quad and North Quad


What does this affect?
Picnic Day got the construction posponded a bit, and Whole Earth Festival was also successful in pushing back the construction (Whole Earth Festival was in serious danger of not having access to the quad).

They improved the sidewalk and road areas around the east quad. There were also improvements made to the utility lines under the street. It was part of a larger series of improvements to all of the streets around the quad.
