Howdy, whoever it is behind this account!  My name is Evan, and I notice that somebody has already put a notice up on your account (that big pink and grey thing) that points out the simple (and common) mistake you made.  The wiki is a community project put together by the people of Davis, so it really helps when people edit using their real identity.  It doesnt have to be first name and last name (some people edit with their first name only, or first name and last initial), but its basically keeping the wiki human, so that everybody doesnt act like its the big bad internet where youll never run into anybody... after all, the people editing here are likely to be shopping in the same grocery store, or their kids are playing soccer in the field you bike or drive past.  Its a community project to document all the cool things about Davis (including Eastlake Apartments!), not a business listings site, so it really helps when we introduce ourselves here as we would in any other community interaction if somebody stuck out their hand and said Hi, Im Susan!.  Welcome to the wiki, and I (and many others) look forward to getting to know you!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
