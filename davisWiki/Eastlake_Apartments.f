20050602 21:16:24 nbsp This complex has only 40 units, which is wonderful for students/professionals who prefer a quieter atmosphere.  The manager is an absolute sweetheart as well. Users/JillWeinstein

20070319 21:42:12 nbsp I love living here and have just resigned my lease to sign onto a third year. I couldnt disagree more with the negative review. The complex, while not perfect, is lovely. The apartments are spacious, the management helpful/prompt/friendly, the grounds neat, the neighborhood quiet its all good in my book! True the former manager Billie left early last year and the office is open less frequently. But the onsite office still has open hours throughout the week AND the Lakeshore office (a sisterapartment complex) is right across the street and is always open, even on Saturdays! I have been over there many times and they have always helped me right away. Our appliances are all in fine working order our fridge and microwave are almost brand new. Once, our stovetop burner went out. I called for a repair and it was fixed within hours. The maintainence crew is courteous, professional and always helpful. Users/StacieTownsend

20080225 12:54:47 nbsp The history of this page shows a deletion of at least two rather negative comments about the (new?) manager and the units themselves.  They appear to have been deleted by the users who posted the comments, but to delete strong comments without leaving an explanation is highly sketchy.  Take a look at the removed negative comments in the history before you take the positive comments here without perhaps a few grains of salt. Users/AaronRosenberg

20080225 13:30:22 nbsp On paper, this complex was high on my list when I went hunting last year.  In reality, the apartments turned out to be small, old, dark, and (at least in the one that I visited) feeling somewhat damp and musty.  It felt very isolating, and I didnt feel like I would be comfortable living there.  The office also had very limited hours.  Lakeshore, across the street, was significantly nicer, although the perpetual construction at that place and rather old and shabby furnishings scared me off.  I did not get the sense that these two places were well run and picked a different place instead. Users/IDoNotExist

20100201 10:13:03 nbsp Allow me to give an honest review of this apartment complex:

First my background: I have lived in stonesfair managed properties for six years, three here and three at greystone. I moved here when a new manager took over at greystone and messed everything up. I am a researcher over at uc davis, after being a student here.

Review: I would characterize my stay here as a series of ups and downs. When I moved in I signed with a manager who had been working here for quite some time (it was back in 2006). When I moved in however, I found that she had been removed (possibly fired). This was disappointing to me as she was one of the reasons why my girlfriend and I decided to move in. After moving in there was no management present. It was very off and on and I was getting very upset because of A) I could not pay rent to a person, I had to put in into a mail box. This would not be a problem except that they lost my check more than once which made it a hassle. B) I could not get my package IF it even was able to be dropped off. C) When I had a maintenance issue I had to call another apartment complex (Lakeshore, another Stonesfair property down the street). After a few months a there was a full time manager and things were great. I moved from my 1 bedroom 1 bath into a 2 bedroom 1 bath and I enjoyed this place. Up until we had no manager again. Then all the same problems crept up and all the same frustrations ensued. I was not going to renew my lease due to this, however a new manager came in and he did the best job I have seen a manager do. He blew me and my girlfriend away with the way he was running thing, and it was an awesome place to live...then as of probably about 4 or 5 months ago there is no permanent management again. Same problems as before. I will not be renewing this time, even if there is a new manager.

This is a small property, 40 or so apartments. Because of this it does not get the respect from Stonesfair that it should. I wonder if they would ever remove the manager from Lakeshore or Greystone, two large complexes...probably not. It is quiet and I as well as my girlfriend enjoy that. The only problem that we have had is that water leaks into our apartment every winter, it has been fixed several times now and nothing has worked. They are fixing it again, so hopefully this time works. This recent leak was the worst as it was coming from the ceiling. I had collected over an inch of water in a 5 gallon bucket over the course of the storms last week.

In conclusion, if you can live with not have a manager present at YOUR complex then this place is great, though I feel the rent is quite high ($1350 next renewal for a 2 bedroom 1 bath). If you would like a manager on site 5 days a week during business hours keep looking. I am sad to see this place go because it has become home over the last 3 years, but I cannot take this lack of a manager any more.

edit: Another couple of things I dislike, the pool is pretty tiny, so dont be fooled by the pictures online. Also the laundry room is pretty tiny, 4 washers and 4 dryers. It is a small complex, but if two people are doing laundry out of 40 apartments you are out of luck. I usually go late at night or very early in the morning to get it done. NEVER on Sunday though. Also the cost has gone up more in the past year than in the previous two years I have been here ($1.50 to wash $1 to dry) Users/JamesKrause

20100405 16:54:13 nbsp When I lived here, the management was very helpful and prompt with repairs. However, they placed many unreasonable charges on the security deposit. Charges for light cleaning to medium/heavy cleaning are applied to every apartment regardless of the cleanliness after moveout. My roommates and I did not hang pictures on the walls or otherwise damage them but we were charged for painting since it was their policy to paint irregardless. The painting charge ran between 200300 dollars. While we were able to get about less than half of the painting charge returned, we only received about a tenth of the deposit back in the end. While my actual time at Eastlake was fine, I would never move back because of the actions of the management.    Users/KellyChen1


20110127 13:06:33 nbsp In order to address anyones current concerns with Eastlake Apartments, I would like to let everyone know that Stonesfair Management has now placed a dedicated manager and maintenance staff at this complex. Any issues that residents had with previous agents at the office should now be cleared up. We work hard to make our residents experiences here as comfortable and pleasant as possible. We are always open to comments and suggestions so please feel free to let us know your concerns and we will work as quickly as possible to address them.   Users/Eastlake

   In my stay at Eastlake we had at least 3 or 4 dedicated managers, so I would take this statement with a grain of salt. I am not trying to pick a fight, I am just saying. For more information read my review above. Users/JamesKrause
