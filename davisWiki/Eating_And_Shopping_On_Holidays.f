As a college town, Davis can be a fairly empty place on holidays.  Many businesses close early, or do not open at all.  Restaurants often close early, although some do stay open quite late (and thus pick up quite a bit of business.)  The following is a list of restaurants and other businesses, and their typical holiday hours.

See also Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Day, and 4th of July for other businesses that may not be listed here.
