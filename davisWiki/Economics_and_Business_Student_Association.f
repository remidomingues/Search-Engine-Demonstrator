The Economics and Business Student Association (EBSA) is the largest undergraduate professional business club at UC Davis aimed to help students gain exposure to the business discipline. At EBSA, our goal is to have our members gain professional skills by participating and learning through our workshops, seminars, and group projects. Members will gain invaluable skills to become competitive business leaders, and gain more insight into their possible future career paths.
