20120624 08:39:54 nbsp Not too happy with the owner. I exchange emails with him about providing me with an estimate and her jerks me around and wont even bother to come out to give me one. STEER CLEAR. Users/DavisLurker

20130424 16:04:19 nbsp This company has been serving my needs a little over a year and they do a great job. They trim bushes, mow the lawn, and manage all the plants at my home. They come on Wed and do everything I ask of them. Their prices are very good for the Davis area. They go above an beyond to make the customer happy. I highly endorse them.   Users/ElizabethBarthel
