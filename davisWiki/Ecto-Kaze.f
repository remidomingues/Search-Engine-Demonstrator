The EctoKaze was born on September 17th, 2006 at Dukes.  Andrea the bartender is credited with concocting this beverage, while it was dubbed by several.

History

The EctoKaze was borne from The http://www.raiders.com/team/coachbio.jsp?id23916 Art Shell Drinking Game.  Participants in this inaugural drinking game were Russell A. and Kelley G.  The game called for a shot of a different colored Kamikaze shooter every time Art Shell was televised with a beleagured look on his countenance.  One of the Kamikazes that Andrea made was bright green, resembling the famous HiC 80s drink, http://www.youtube.com/watch?vKdARlTpw_Y0 EctoCooler.

Since the Art Shell Drinking Game, these EctoKazes have been consumed for a multitude of reasons.  Most recently, it was consumed in celebration of The King (from the Burger King commercials) tackling St. Louis Rams wide receiver http://www.torryholt.com/ Torry Holt.
