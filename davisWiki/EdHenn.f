20070331 22:23:39 nbsp love the one from your child...  Unfortunately ,Im helping someone move tomorrow so I cant meet up with you and Jason... Users/WesHardaker

20070331 22:31:47 nbsp He told me it was next week anyway, which would be Easter.  Well get it together eventually. Users/EdHenn

20070408 06:16:51 nbsp Ha!  I also have a big bag of various mixed color dice, plus three small bags of loaner dice.  Thats my Going to play chest, and I took out the big rubber eraser and calculator that sits on top, and fished out a couple figs I had in there so it was just dice.  Not long after I built the chest, I started collecting just black and red dice of all sizes.  I have minidice and huge oversized dice in there, all black and red, plus three dark green pearl dice that are my character rollup dice.  I dont particularly have a thing for dice, I just got started over 20 years ago, and they tend to accumulate. Users/JabberWokky

20070412 06:45:02 nbsp Ha, yeah I see that after I put it back and cannot make another edit.  Lets leave it in, and I will add a bug report now.  Thanks. Users/DavidGrundler

20070415 22:30:36 nbsp Ed, alpha by last name is preferred...  I was just lazy. Users/DavidGrundler

20070419 19:41:11 nbsp Freaking beautiful photo of ginko leaves.  My hat is off to you, sir. Users/JabberWokky

20070421 21:38:26 nbsp Aww man, shame I was out of town I would have guessed the secret path so quick. Users/StevenDaubert

20070425 12:00:48 nbsp Thanks!  Mix?  Yeah, right.  How about I mount my GPS unit in a car and drive to the top of mix?  Does that count?  I will eventually try mix, but not until I get into much better shape then I am in right now, and I get a bike with a triple (I would definitely need the granny gear). Users/DavidGrundler

20070426 01:43:17 nbsp Theres a geocache in the secret path?! Users/StevenDaubert
   So Im told...  check the history on mystery picture
     This one (a long one) ends on the path: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wpGCg842&Submit6Find GCG842 Users/WesHardaker

20070503 04:13:09 nbsp I have no idea how I could possibly have written that KDVS was the only station.  I blame the coffee.  Ah, well... thanks for the correction. Users/JabberWokky

20070511 10:02:39 nbsp Ed, where did you get your recumbent?  Do you know if any of the local shops carry any? Users/DavidGrundler
  I put some info on Where Can I ... a while back, but can repeat here.  Several local shops have one or two models, Ive seen them at various times at Kens Bike & Ski Kens, B&L Bike Shop B&L, and Bike Barn.  My current bike is from http://www.tandemsrecumbents.com/ Gold Country Cyclery in Shingle Springs.  Its a small but excellent shop absolutely filled with tandems and recumbents only.  Youre welcome to a test ride on my http://www.ransbikes.com Rans VRex.  I see youre corner marshaling for DDC too, when are you going to checkin?
   Ed, thanks for the info and the offer for a test ride.  I might send my sister over on Friday to pick up the flag/vest because I will probably still be in the bay area.  On Saturday, I plan on just going straight to my corner.  I might be out by shingle springs midweek, so I think I will try to drop in to GCC.  Users/DavidGrundler

20070528 19:21:21 nbsp I look forward to seeing your what your pops thinks about the limone sorbetto... Users/StevenDaubert

20070627 20:34:01 nbsp How long ago was the bookstore there? Could you be thinking of the Game Perserve? Users/JamesSchwab
  Definitely not Game Preserve, I remember that too, between 2nd and 3rd and off the street.  This was directly facing the street, I believe on D between 3rd & 4th.  It really was in a little house, actually the front half of a duplex if I remember correctly.  Probably departed in the mid80s.  Wow I hope Im not losing my mind.  Users/EdHenn

20071205 01:27:26 nbsp Hi there, Ed! I just sent you an email... hope I got the instructions right Users/JudithOlert

20080229 22:21:37 nbsp Oh, about the alleged bookstore: on Departed Businesses I wrote about agAccess, but front half of a duplex is NOT agAccess. D Street? No clue, buddy  youve been in this town longer than I, it seems! Users/DougWalter

20080413 07:56:58 nbsp Dude, Katie tried that last night too...  Who in the heck timed the shot so well!  thats fantastic! Users/WesHardaker
  Beth took the photo and did a great job, didnt she?  I like the hair & sunglasses both in the process of flying away.  Most of the other midway games are pretty obviously unwinnable, but this insane ladder thing looks almost possible and is actually completely against the laws of physics.  Its like just step within my event horizon and back again impossible.  And lots of fun.  I failed twice miserably.  Users/EdHenn

20080414 21:33:16 nbsp Have you seen http://www.blifaloo.com/info/beatcarnivalgames.php?showalltrue this guide to carnival games? It mentions the one you were playing. Users/JasonAller

20081010 09:06:16 nbsp hahahha.  Sir, youre cracking me up.  Yeah I think when you grow up in this town, biking is ingrained into you early on and distances can be put into pedal terms pretty easy.  :) Users/jefftolentino
