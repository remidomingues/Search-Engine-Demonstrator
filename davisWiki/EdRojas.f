Davis Dollars Intern

Hey Ed... No worries.  The aggressive name got a reaction, which is probably why you chose it (as you say, you made it to protest the front page, which is pretty obvious).  I acknowledged as being aggressive and angry, but the real problem was associating it with a cool project like Davis Dollars, which is what I was lamenting.  Im glad to hear you used the account for Davis Dollars out of honest ignorance (which we all suffer from time to time!) rather than just being nasty.  Thanks for the note, and I look forward to seeing where Davis Dollars goes from here. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
