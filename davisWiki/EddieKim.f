http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~ekim/ Eddie Kim (Davis Wiki: EddieKim) returned UC Davis as a lecturer for Spring 2013, for one quarter only, having earlier studied at UC Davis to earn a Ph.D. in Mathematics mathematics.  He grew up in Santa Rosa and is a graduate of UC Berkeley Cal (Go Bears!).

He believes that Users/Buffalobuffalobuffalo is entirely too good at finding LaTeXing errors on CVs! :)

Around town, you might spot him at Mishkas, The ASUCD Coffee House (everyone should eat their awesome Chicken Tetrazzini), University Covenant Church, First Baptist Church, The Episcopal Church of St. Martin, Davis Lutheran Church/Crossings Alternative Worship Crossings, and The Belfry.  His fuel of choice is Coffee coffee.  He laments Davis lack of Mobile Phones cell phone reception, and the worst building of all for reception seems to be homeawayfromhome, the Mathematical Sciences Building.

His favorite places just outside of Davis include: the Tacos El Paisano Restaurant & Taco Truck El Paisano taco truck, St. Lukes Episcopal Church, and San Francisco (if that can count).

Outside of daylight hours, you can try to catch EddieKim swing dancing at KetMoRee on Sundays, Davis Swing Dancers on Mondays, Club 21 on Tuesdays, Firehouse 5 on Wednesdays, Our House on Thursdays, and Midtown Stomp on Fridays. Additionally, hell pop in to blues at Firehouse 5 on Sundays.

For the record, EddieKim has never put any snakes on a plane.
