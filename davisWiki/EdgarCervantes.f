His name es Edgar Cervantes. His homeland is the far off Hispanics Mexican Land of Tijuana where he was born and raised. Now he resides in the South Davis southern lands at the Oakshade Commons.

Originally coming to Davis to be a Freshman at UC Davis he chose to take some time off to both find himself and um, Get himself off of Academic Disqualification. But mostly to find himself. He really wasnt forced by psychologists or anything. Really.

After a long time of thought, he realized that it was time to give back to the community. To do this he had volunteered to keep AM PM open at night, braving the harsh early morning elements of vampires, hungry Frat Row frat boys, and Race & Ethnicity humans.

After being fired from Am/Pm AmPm (not because of showing up to work intoxicated), he went to keep giving back to the community by working at Circle k, where he also got fired from (Not because of getting intoxicated at work). After that, he went back to school, and is now studying and working at the Annual Fund, where he happily gets bitched at by angry alumni, who do not want to give donations to the filthy rich UC Davis university. Who understands them alumni?
