 About Edible Landscaping 

According to the Davis Permaculture http://www.dpug.blogspot.com Users Group, in its most simple connotation, edible landscaping is the planting of anything that can be eaten, from a fruit trees fruitbearing tree in the backyard to rosemary planted on the street median.  On this level it can be synonymous with gardening – a traditional annualbased garden is an edible landscape.  Usually, however, edible landscaping refers to a slightly more complex assortment of functions, namely edibility and Art in Public Places aesthetics.  Edible landscaping is one major component of permaculture design where the emphasis is usually on Town Flora perennial plants.  At its most complex, edible landscaping might not even be recognized as such, as in the case of the Amazon rainforest or preconquest California.  Neither landscape was recognized by European explorers and settlers as having been intensively managed by their native inhabitants see http://www.patternliteracy.com/beyondwilderness.html Toby Hemenway’s article), but in truth this was exactly the case to the extent that some plant species even evolved to succeed with the presence of human cultivation. UCD professor M. Kat Andersone’s “Tending the Wild” is an indepth study of different cultivation techniques used by native California Californians, including planting, pruning, and harvesting techniques that encouraged plant growth and diversity, as well as fire management and deliberate creation of habitat and browse areas for other species.  Her book is an important resource for those who want to consider the interface between native plants and the people who live with them in California.

In Davis, edible landscaping ranges from the periodic occurrence of purposeful plantings (like the fig and pomegranate trees in front of the Davis Food CoOp) to more systematic attempts (like the olive trees along Russell Blvd).  Though it’s questionable whether the olive trees were originally intended to provide their fruit for any purpose, they’re now being harvested and pressed into olive oil.  See http://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/0405/extra_virgin.html  .  On campus there is another example of edible landscaping in front of the Plant and Environmental Sciences building, where the grounds division has planted some winter crops such as chard and onions (http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id9049), after the summer’s plantings of tomatoes and bell peppers.  Along Russell Blvd. (west of Hwy 113) the street is lined with black walnuts, a native tree, and taken even a step further, many of the oaks in town produce acorns that could be processed and eaten.

Usually, however, Landscape Design designs for edible landscapes rely on ‘exotics’ (simply nonnative to the region in which they’re being planted) and there are extensive lists of plants utilized by people in different regions.  A very interesting site is related to a wellknown book on Permaculture gardening, called “Plants for a Future” by Ken Fern.  The http://www.pfaf.org website provides information on a great variety of plants, many of which might be new to Davis gardeners – though that may be because they don’t grow well here more than a lack of publicity.  This same information is indexed in the back of the book, and is a great resource.  There are books available on edible landscaping – some at the Davis Branch Library public library, and some at the Shields Library UCD Agricultural and Resource Economics Library libraries.  “Designing and Maintaining Your Edible Landscape Naturally,” by Robert Kourik has a section on the landscaping of Village Homes (with pictures taken when the trees were still small which makes for an interesting contrast to how it looks now).

An openness to the concept of edible landscaping can lead to a great benefit – free food!  Imagine being able to forage for raspberries on a late spring day, or being able to go outside in the morning and choose herbs for tea, or harvesting fruit for preserves right from your yard .  If you like what you imagine, maybe it’s time to landscape with edibles!

The Outside Magazine Article about Davis brings up the concept of edible landscaping employed in some areas of the city.  This refers to the community vineyards and orchards yielding grapes, persimmons, cherries, almonds, and peaches.

 Examples 

 Fruit 
  Someone may have some Surplus produce to offer to drop off. Or you may be able to offer to pick some up.
  You can also ask someone in Davis High School Robotics Club Citrus Circuits Robotics for some good tree suggestions!
  Figs  Grows in several places.  A couple small trees behind the Vegetable Crops greenhouse off of Hutchison Drive Hutchison on UC Davis campus. Also, there are a few trees between Olson Hall and Voorhies Hall. (The tree above the bike racks at the Davis Food Coop is a fig tree, but the City insisted its fruit be sterile, so that a ripe fig would never drop on a parked car.)
  Berries  Blackberries grow in many of the wilder areas around the edge of town. Probably other berries, too. The little strawberries youll commonly see growing around downtown are decorative. They may or may not be poisonous, but regardless, they dont taste good and arent worth picking.
  Sort of free  although you have to pay for your final basketful of fruit forage at Impossible Acres, you can eat while you pick. Until they start weighing people before and after they go picking, stomached fruits carry a price equal to only the thrust of your next bowel movement.
  There are apple trees along segments of the South Davis Bike Path. There is also an apple tree that hangs over the fence at the southwest entrance to Slide Hill Park, which produces lots of felled fruit.
  There is at least one grape vine on the fence alongside the Russel bike path west of the main campus, as well as other places around town.
  Tons of delicious golden seedless grapes  hanging over the eastbound bike lane on Covell, right past Covell & Sycamore. Ripe in late September.
  Tomato Trucks Road tomatoes are free in the summer months. These are tomatoes that fall off the tomato trucks while in transport.  Usually plentiful around on/off ramps, and at bends on county roads.
  The loquat trees in the south courtyard of Cruess Hall  fruit seasonally around late spring.
  The J Street Coop has some fruit trees (plums, kumquats, cherries, figs, persimmons and apricots). Feel free to taste whatever is ripe but please dont take lots since the residents like to eat fruit too.
  Pomegranate trees line the rear parking lot at Chaparral Apartments in north Davis  fruit seasonally around September.
  Theres a few pomegranate trees with complimentary pavement for cracking the things on the Covell Greenbelt.
  Cook the pomegranates with recipes from http://www.pomegranateworld.com Pomegranate World.
  The apricot trees between the Chemistry Building and Everson Hall  fruit seasonally around late spring.
  An Orange trees orange tree has fruit yearround just south of Parking Lot 10 (intersection of A St. & Hutchison Dr.). To get the fruit in the winter, you may have to do some Tree Climbing tree climbing.
  The wiki:Wikipedia:Prickly_Pear Prickly Pear cactus has edible branches/pads (called nopales) as well as an edible fruit in the summer (the pear). Dont take too many nopales, as these cacti grow very slowly. Be sure to watch out for tiny, hairthin barbed thorns. (Use two forks to pluck these fruit without turning your hand into a pincushion.)  Theyre found in the Arboretum, behind Walker Hall, and at Cactus Corner.
  Ornamental plum trees are common and easy to spot with their dark purple leaves and bark. When ripe in the late spring/early summer they are rather tasty. It takes a little patience to spot purple fruit against a backdrop of purple leaves and branches.
     Theres a row of ornamental plums along the west side of F Street between 8th Street 8th and 9th Street 9th Streets.
  For students taking Plant Biology 143  Evolution of Crop Plants, a free Crop of the Day starts off every class meeting.
  Many university departments, especially Pomology, Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry, and others dealing with plants, have copious amounts of plants that have been used in research experiments.  These are usually safe for human consumption, and often go home with University employees or go bad.  If you get in good with a professor or TA, (s)he might be able to hook you up.
  Walnuts Walnut trees grow on the west side of Birch Lane School, on the roadside of the staff parking lot.  Dont go between 8am and 3:30 on weekdays you might agitate the administration by being an intruder on campus.

 Herbs 
  Many herbs can be found in the herb garden inside the Student Experimental Farm, they are free to pick but please make sure the plants will survive.
  California Bay  a spice often used in corned beef and mulling spices, leaves from this tree have a powerful flavor and aroma. The Arboretum at UC Davis has bay trees growing there. (Location, anyone?)
  The Student Experimental Farm features an culinary and medicinal herb garden, complemented by a few fruit trees.
  Mints Peppermint  Great for tea and mint juleps, this plant grows wild in the EC Gardens. Want to grow your own? Pull a stalk with roots attached and transplant  its practically a voracious weed.
  Rosemary  this plant is so ubiquitous as landscaping its not even funny. But for good quality stuff, try the EC Gardens, where it grows tall and wild.
  Mints Spearmint  Great for tea, seasoning lamb, and garnishes, find it growing wild in the EC Gardens. Grows most prolifically near water spigots.
  Lavender  Good for tea, potpourri/essential oils, decoration. There is a huge bush with plenty of surplus at the EC Gardens, and several bushes in the Arboretum.
