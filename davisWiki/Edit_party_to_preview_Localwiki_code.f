The new http://localwiki.org Localwiki code has been rolled out to a few https://guide.localwiki.org/Communities communities, and will be coming to Davis soon. Since the wiki:Sacramento Sacwiki has recently upgraded to the new Localwiki code, lets have a wiki gatherings gettogether to play around with the new code!

I (Users/NicholasBarry) live in Davis but have been working on Sacwiki a lot for my job, so I can show everyone around. Its really easy to use, so you dont actually need me, but Im happy to answer questions and whatnot. Meeting at Delta of Venus some evening for a couple of hours would be easy and fun. What do people think?
