Ednas Playground, for All Dogs Big and Small was created and opened in 2006, thanks due to donation by the Gorland family.  Located just outside the CCAH building of the VMTH, Ednas Playground is a very small Dog Parks dog park and sitting area.  An outside sitting area has several benches on top of carefully laid bricks, with some of them dedicated to certain donaters and even lain as memorials for loved pets.  Unfortunately, its also located near a large field that often contains several horses and a donkey, and a corresponding smell is noticable with a light breeze.

The main focus is of course the agility park!  Agility is a common dog sport seen both on TV and showcased at notable UC Davis Events Board events such as Picnic Day. Theres a pause table, weave poles, a couple of jumps, and contact obstacles such as a dog walk, a seesaw, an Aframe, and a tunnel.
