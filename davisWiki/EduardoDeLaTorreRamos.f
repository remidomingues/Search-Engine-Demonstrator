20080124 02:23:32 nbsp Hey, Eduardo, I linked a few things from your public profile and noticed that the wiki does not yet have entries for the Department of Public Health Sciences or Students for Barack Obama.  The first is fairly important to have, and the latter is one of those subjects that will vanish into history unless somebody writes a bit about it now for the historical record.   It would be great if you could contribute a couple paragraphs to the wiki about these topics.  Users/JabberWokky
