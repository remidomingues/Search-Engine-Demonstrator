A new eatery named Cafe Diablo opened in the same location in March 2012. Like the old eatery, it is staffed by students.


The Educated Eatery is the http://dhs.djusd.k12.ca.us/files/courses/rop.html ROP food service class taught by Don White at Davis High School, It specializes in breakfast.  It is known as the restaurants eatery around campus / town. They serve awesome hash browns (which are more like home fries) and biscuits and gravy. Its cheap and damn good.  One of the most popular items is the Big Joe named after 20002001 DHS basketball center Big Joe Chambers. Its a crispy tortilla, eggs, sausage, and browns with some cheese, price to come. You can also get a 12 paper plate heaping with browns for one dollar, and the turnaround time on said order is always PDQ.

Mr. White does all the shopping for the eatery every day before it opens, its always fresh and great tasting.  Be warned though, entering the DHS campus is tricky business, you can just go the office and sign in visiting Mr. White and be sure to be insistent that he knows your coming, or you can sneak in the back through the MPR, just watch the yard narks cause they will give you grief.  The restaurant is primarily designed for teacher and student populations, rather than the general public. But this is Davis, were nice and friendly so you should at least give it a shot!

They also make cookies hot and fresh, about 4 in diameter for 35 cents. The eatery closes around 10:30 for students and the general public where it transforms into a restaurant for the staff only. The staff food is more than damn good as Mr. White is a full fledged chef. They make steaks and chicken etc for the teachers.

If you fancy yourself an eater go and get the Boss Hog which is an order and a half of browns, 4 eggs, 4 slices of ham, and a plate sized pancake, plus a small glass of OJ. It costs $6 and you get your name on a list if you finish it in one sitting. Image(bosshog.jpg, thumbnail, right, 300)

Mr. White is known for his nobull attitude and often encourages students to walk in the light with Mr. White and dont get doped up on dope.  He (or one of his students) developed a sort of gang sign one year to be used amongst Educated Eatery students.  It consists of holding your hand out sideways (as one would a gang sign) and then flashing index and middle finger, then index finger, then index and middle finger again.  This signifies the number 212, or the boiling point of water.  Some of his other favorite subjects of conversation are politics, extraterrestrial life in outer space, and the virtues of aluminum foil.


20061207 16:37:41 nbsp I was pissed I didnt figure out about the eatery until halfway thru my Sophomore year, I was pretty pissed I had missed out for a semster. If you ever go there spend $3 on the Daubert its a Big Joe x2 except for the browns. If you want it with gravy get the Dirty Daubert Users/StevenDaubert

20061207 16:55:46 nbsp Is this open to the public? Users/ArlenAbraham
   From the entry: The eatery closes around 10:30 for students and the general public, although Id prefer more clarity as well.  Sounds good. Users/JabberWokky jw

20070623 15:58:48 nbsp I had a big joe. It was cheap and awesome. Definitely a good way to Living cheaply eat cheaply if you dont mind getting permission to visit and dealing with the annoying yard guards. Id go back some other time, but it looks like the ROP food service program is being cancelled. Boo. :( Users/WilliamLewis

20071113 10:21:52 nbsp So...we have to contact him if were going?...and where is it in DHS? Users/ArianeMetz

20071225 17:54:56 nbsp I worked here when during senior year. It was a lot of fun, and the food wasnt bad at all. Good times! Users/thelonepiper555

20080409 23:17:08 nbsp A good way to troll Mr. White is to order a Daubert (its a big joe x2 except for the taters which remain the same)

a good add on to that is to get the Dirty Daubert (smothered in gravy) Users/StevenDaubert

20080519 21:55:42 nbsp Where in the high school is this?  I feel awkward walking around searching for it... Users/SunjeetBaadkar
 I dont know if this still is open. If it is, the map point is over the eatery. Youre gonna have to call ahead to get to it because there is a closed campus policy. wl
