Study abroad is an integral part of a UC Davis education. Through academic coursework, internships and experiential learning, UC Davis Study Abroad provides every student the opportunity to graduate with an international experience. We promote an internationalized campus that cultivates an understanding of our diverse global community. We challenge our students to study, explore and engage with other culturesâ€”to broaden their perspective and involvement in the world.
