 What is ESLP? 

The Education for Sustainability Sustainable Living Program (ESLP) is a collaborative interdisciplinary effort to realize a sustainable community throughout the University of California. This course is structured as a 2unit seminar series, hosting guest lectures by renowned educators, authors, environmentalists, and progressive thinkers. Lectures are open to the public free of charge to encourage collaboration between the campus and local community. The course encourages reflection upon and analysis of the principles of sustainability (EQUITY, ECONOMY, ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATION), and is designed to encourage dialogue between students, faculty, staff, administration, local community, and the entire UC system.

For 2 additional units, students have the option to form Action Research Teams (ARTs) in partnership with guest lecturers, faculty, UCD Administrative Officers administration, and community members to implement tangible change. These groups focus on campus specific issues such as sustainable transportation, socially & environmentally preferable purchasing, energy consumption reduction, waste reduction/prevention, and green building. Such experiential learning inspires participants to internalize the concept of sustainability, and carry it in practice beyond academia into a greater society.  Students may enroll in this course to receive two units of academic credit for selected departments, or may opt to take the course for four units by participating in the Action Research Teams.

Additionally, this lecture series is open to everyone in the Davis community.

We are putting out a call for ART (Action Research Team) leaders! This is a great opportunity to work with students, staff, and faculty to implement change on the UC Davis campus. If you are interest in leading an ART come to the farmers market on Saturdays at 12pm in Winter Quarter 2013 and email Emili (emabdel@ucdavis.edu)

 Objectives for Course 

I.   Explore the meaning of sustainability.

II.  Explore specific ways to apply the concepts of sustainability to daily lives and to our university.

III. Encourage communication and collaboration between all members of the campus community to envision, initiate, and enact tangible change locally, nationally, and globally.

IV. Challenge participants to think beyond the short term interests that currently drive global systems; examine how our present decisions and action affect future generations; apply a cross disciplinary systems level analysis to our community decisions and consider their regional and global effects.

   EWaste Recycling  Issy Demilian

   Volunteer Gardening Team 

   Seeds on Wheels  Melanie Lataste, davisseedsavers@gmail.comImage(Seed_Savers_Profile.JPG,thumbnail,100,right)

Help the Davis Seed Savers Alliance build a portable seed cabinet structure “Seeds on Wheels” with recycled materials for the Domes Seed Library! We are looking for a userfriendly design with a bike hauling system. Then, reorganizing the seeds, figuring out interesting seed categories and creative labels. We will finalize the project with a seed event introducing the Domies and Davis community to the “Seeds on Wheels” Lending Library. The goal is to provide a convenient and free access to seed everywhere in Davis. The Davis Seed Savers will teach one aspect of saving seed each week. No specific skills are required to participate except enthusiasm and creativity!”

   The Davis Bee Sanctuary: a collaborative space for People & Bees  Melanie Lataste & Derek Downey, melanie.lataste@yahoo.fr, beelovepermaculture@gmail.comImage(Bee_Sanctuary_Profile.JPG,thumbnail,100,Right)

Help the Davis Bee Collective transform the Davis Bee Sanctuary garden into an educational and creative space introducing native bees & their habitat, 3 different hive designs & natural beekeeping, medicinal herbs, and permaculture techniques. Map making, native bee habitat building and sign designing are the core features of the project, but students can also experiment natural beekeeping and permaculture gardening depending on their interest. The goal is to invite everyone to experience the joys of observing and learning about bees in a peoplebee friendly environment. We will finalize the project with an event presenting the Bee Sanctuary to the Davis Community. For those who are afraid or allergic to bee stings, the designing, map and sign making do not overexpose students to bee encounter.

   Davis Dirt Radio  AnnaRuth Crittenden, arcrittenden@ucdavis.edu

   UCD Food Recovery Network  Stefanie Scott & James Kreidler, sfmscott@ucdavis.edu

Help feed the community and make UC Davis more sustainable! The Food Recovery Network (FRN) is actually a nationwide organization thats goal is to help with diverting overproduced and left over food from university food systems to places that help feed those that are in need (more info http://www.foodrecoverynetwork.org ). UC Davis has just recently become a chapter of the Food Recovery Network, and we are officially launching the program this Spring quarter through the  UCD FRN club. The goal is to have students participating in the system by delivering the food from the campus dining commons to the donation locations, and have fun doing it. Participants will also be able to help with developing the system (finding out ways to improve it), researching new places and creative ways to deliver food and feed more people, figuring out how to keep the system going over the Summer, and are encouraged to come to club meetings. It is preferred that students have a car to make deliveries, but biking will suffice.

 Action Research Teams (ARTs) 

The purpose of these “action research teams” is to involve students in a process of experiential learning by collaborating with faculty, staff, administration, and community members to implement tangible change at our university. Action Research Teams are lead by graduate students, students, or even community members, and meet weekly, outside of scheduled class time. Students earn an additional 2units (total of 4 units w/ lecture and ART) for participation in an ART. Specific areas of focus could include but are not limited to:
         Food Systems & Agriculture
         Community Development
         Green Building
         Transportation
         Renewable Energy
         Natural Resource Management
         Environmental justice
         Public policy
         Religion and spirituality
         Sustainable Consumerism

The Education for Sustainable Living Program is requesting proposals from graduate students, undergraduates, or community members to lead action oriented research groups related to sustainability in our campus community. If you are interested in coordinating an “action research team” please express interest TODAY!  If interested in leading an ART, we ask that a general project proposal (proposal form attached below) be submitted to Stephanie Castle at stcastle@ucdavis.edu by Wednesday, March 17th. After submission, proposals will be reviewed and organizers for the course will work with you to develop specific project guidelines by the end of winter quarter. Please contact Stephanie Castle (stcastle@ucdavis.edu) for more information!

 Our Salt March?: Thinking about Change  Tobias Joel, thjoel@ucdavis.edu
                              Tobias herethis ART will really be a lot of fun. We will address the elephant in the room. That is, slow down and look critically at the change we (as a movement) are trying to enact, and explore the modes of thought underpinning the problems we work to solve. That means taking responsibility for their causes and, from that point, considering how we can move forward. As we dig into these issues we will awaken our movement to a renewed introspection and, moreover, selfdoubt. The goal is NOT to simply devise some homogeneous, systemic understanding of sustainability. That would only replace the artificiality of mainstream culture with our own homegrown myths. Instead we will create a space to recognize sustainabilitys plurality of meanings and consider, What are we actually trying to do?
                              We will read one short (but rich) text a week and meet to discuss. Each participant will produce a small reflection on these issues by the end of the quarter (an essay, poem, drawing, performance piecewhatever you like!). Those will be the only assignments. Its about thinking. The flavor will be laidback, calm and happy. Finally, the ART will organize a public demonstration in which all of ESLP can participate. That will be fun. EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE AND COME TO ANY MEETINGS.
