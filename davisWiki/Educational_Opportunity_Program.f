The Educational Opportunity Program
The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at the University of California, Davis began in 1968. The program offers an array of services to help students adapt both academically and socially to the University setting and achieve their educational and personal goals.  The transition from high school or community college to a large research university can be overwhelming.  EOP provides a caring and supportive environment for students to meet with peer and professional advisers and network with other students.  Three staff advisers and a group of 15 peer advising counselors, in conjunction with other campus units, work together to offer students the following services and activities.Please stop by the EOP office in South Hall to meet our friendly staff and peers.  The office is open from 94 daily, and no appointment is necessary.

  Preenrollment assistance
  Academic Advising
  Orientation and welcome activities
  Personal and social support
  Information and skill development workshops
  Weekly newsletter
  Tutoring and supplemental instruction through the Student Academic Success Center
  Guardian Scholars, a support network for former foster youth

Our Mission
The Educational Opportunity Program is committed to serving the UC Davis Community. We strive to maintain a climate of academic excellence and maximize retention by providing academic, and social support and peer counseling. We affirm our commitment by raising student awareness in current political and social issues. Through our programs we recognize, appreciate, and cherish the richness of our diversity.”
