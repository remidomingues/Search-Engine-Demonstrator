Still, thanks for the recent edits: the wiki is built of contributions from everybody.  Since Woodland Cleaners makes the claim of being organic, I reinstated it, reworded it to say they are making a claim of, and then dropped in the rather important points you made on the talk page.  Since they are making the claim, it seems to be more informative and useful to the community to point out the issues with the claim than simply ignore it.  By the way  I saw your edit on the LARP entry; do you play? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

  20091229 11:44:47   Howdy JW. Im new to daviswiki, but not wikis in general... Ive been checking this place out for a while, RC is a great place to get local news. Before I removed that businesses organic claim, I looked them up to see if theyre listed by CCOF as an organic business... no dice. My guess is they just threw it up as a marketing word and dont understand how involved it is getting organic certification, or the criminal and civil penalties involved in falsely claiming to be organic or certified organic. I used to play in LARPs, but back in their heyday in the late 90s and early oughts. It seems that WW hasnt been doing a good job of getting new players. Nice to meetcha. —EdwardNiemand

20091229 22:49:31 nbsp Yes, thanks for those comments about dry cleaners.  I found them very helpful. Users/CovertProfessor

20100113 11:42:13 nbsp If youre doing a publicity campaign, want some Wiki Sticker/Requests stickers? Users/WilliamLewis
      Hey, those look dandy. I might take you up on the offer, but for now Im going to tentatively just flier... Id hate to get arrested for vandalism. Maybe if we start tabling again at the farmers market we could pass those out.  Users/EdwardNiemand

20100113 11:43:11 nbsp Ha!  Go for it... once somebody leads the way, you can likely get some support.  There have also been some other promotional things like tabling at the Farmers Market and other events. Users/JabberWokky

20100113 12:06:59 nbsp Hey, nice posters! They do a good job of playing up the wiki as a source of information. Do you have any good ideas to encourage contributions that arent reviews of businesses and such? Id like to get away from our perception as some sort of local, nonprofit Yelp (we have too many business owners interacting with us as such). Users/WilliamLewis

20100113 14:35:38 nbsp dont sign things as Ed <.<  It took me a few years to break that habit here :P Users/EdWins

20100113 20:54:44 nbsp Are you always a white knight?

Welcome to the wiki btw ♥ Users/StevenDaubert

20100115 12:51:03 nbsp @ Steven  Give me your weak, your downtrodden, your comic book shops with nasty comments, your dry cleaners yearning to breathe free... Users/EdwardNiemand

20100121 08:02:25 nbsp Im sorry its so long, there are several issues, and several board members I want to step down. Users/PxlAted

20100121 08:39:11 nbsp RE: I understand that youre pissed at them, and your position of homelessness sucks, but is bringing that feud onto this site what you should be spending your time on? You dont know me at all or what I spend my time on. Im not feuding, Im expressing specific problems, concerns, and complaints about certain members of a local, public, not for profit organization. Users/PxlAted

20100121 08:58:33 nbsp Personal problems and complaints. Users/EdwardNiemand

20100121 10:15:55 nbsp Wes and Dan are excluded from voting here because their own interests blind them to the greater good of the wiki. Do you have the power to do that? How do I get the power to prevent other people from voting? Can I declare your votes invalid, too?  As a side comment: Well said.  I actually dropped the phrase, but I originally wrote too much pseudolegalism, authoritarian posturing and game playing.  I figured that would obscure the more ontopic points, and many editors present their opinions with great assertiveness and might have thought I was referring to them.  I think William was just trying to move things along and block potential complaints, aware that anybody who wanted to could object. Users/JabberWokky

   Just making sure that this place isnt succumbing to wikidisease. EN

20100128 10:40:46 nbsp Our IRS tax exemption prohibits pricelists from forprofit entities. When I removed the prices on the Real Computers page, Brian fought with me, found out I was right, and started removing prices from all his competitors. Users/WilliamLewis

20100407 16:12:54 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Con_Artists?actiondiff&version2161&version1160 I was going to say, cpc § 148.5(b). Users/WilliamLewis

20100407 16:14:06 nbsp For someone who was worried about the Con Artist page being too cluttered, you sure have gone off on a tangent. Users/CovertProfessor

      Ha ha! I know, I know, I knew it when I was writing it, but its hard to be both right and quiet about it! :) I moved the thread down into the comments section of the page, to unclutter it a bit. Users/EdwardNiemand

20100407 16:52:43 nbsp More important than pricing information is the phrasing of the page.  That page looks like its written in the tone of the business we should rewrite it Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Agreed. EN

20100623 21:08:22 nbsp Can you send me an email?  philipn at gmail.com Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100624 09:29:48 nbsp email sent. Users/EdwardNiemand

20100627 16:56:18 nbsp Yup, thats me in the video.   It got me to install the flash plugin that I had been stubbornly not plugging in, just to see my eyes widening into interrobangs. Users/Angel.York
