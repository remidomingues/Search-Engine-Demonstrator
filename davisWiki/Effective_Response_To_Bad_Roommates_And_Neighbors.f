Do you have a neighbor or roommate with whom things arent (werent) working out?  Did you have an approach to dealing with them that worked well?  Or perhaps one that didnt work at all (and even made things worse...)  If so, let us know what the circumstances were, what your approach was, and whether the approach was successful or unsuccessful.  In order to keep things civil and of use to many people, use general terms rather than specific names.  We are looking for information on general experiences and approaches that other people might use in similar situations, not for things that might become associated with a specific person.

Problem: Roommate was frequently late in paying their share of the rent, for which all roommates are jointly responsible.
  Solution: The person who was responsible for writing out the single check to the landlord refused to pay the rent until all roommates paid them.
  Effectiveness: All roommates paid on time or early from that point on.
  Pitfall: Potential late payments.




Problem: Roommate did not help clean up before moving out.
  Solution: Returned deposit goes to those who help clean up.
  Effectiveness: People will help if they want their money.
  Pitfall: Potential for disagreements, money problems.
