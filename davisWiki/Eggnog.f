Eggnog is a holiday treat! It only is around from late October to around February. Some people wait all year for eggnog to come back into stores. Eggnog is served at many holiday parties, and may be accompanied with a bottle of alcohol rum. Depending on the brand, eggnog is either thin like milk, or thick. Thick tastes better. A good eggnog is Crystal Eggnog. It is not the cheapest, but it is not expensive for such a delectable treat.

If you arent careful, you can get very bad food poisoning from it. Make sure its kept cold and not kept too long. I learned from (bad) experience with the supermarket stuff (perhaps it was too mean)... Users/SteveDavison

I survived Albertsons Dumpster Diving dumpster eggnog.  Users/BenjaminMiller

Yeah, me and my friends used to go to Albertsons and get eggnog and drink it at lunch. It is good for about half of a quart but then once it warms up, it makes you a little sick. Users/TaylorClark
