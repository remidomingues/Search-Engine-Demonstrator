The Address(Eichhorn Family House, 38.540383717063, 121.744092458215) is located at the east end of campus, tucked behind the Center for Child & Family Studies. It is part of the Human Development Department of Human and Community Development. It was funded by private donation.

It houses several offices used by graduate students and faculty and well as research space. Some of these rooms are designed with oneway mirrors and inconspicuous cameras to record and monitor research participants.

The facility was designed to look and feel like a home rather than a more typical research space. It includes a fully functional kitchen and dining area, a living room with large windows, and previously had working laundry facilities. It was designed this way in order to make participants, in particular families with small children, feel more comfortable than they might in a more traditional research facility.

The building is not publicly accessible, and requires keycards to access it; these are only available to people who are involved in research there.
