20090818 09:23:34 nbsp Hey, El... theres a mapping system built into the wiki (check out most places entries on the wiki, and note the Map icon).  You can read up on wiki:wikispot:Help with Maps, which is pretty easy if its either at an address or you know the lat/long. Users/JabberWokky

20090818 09:35:28 nbsp Whups... sorry about that.  I thought you were done with the entry.  Edit collisions happen now and then on the wiki. :) Im done with my changes, so edit away. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
