20060329 16:25:02 nbsp I had a terrible experience at this cleaners. Not only do they have terrible custormer service, they do not stand behind their work and were unreasonable and extremely rude. My alterations were not completed as promised. Besides being extremely rude, they are also overpriced.   SamBallard

20070907 09:35:39 nbsp I had just moved to this area of Davis and needed a quick measurement for a bridesmaid dress, and ran in here, hoping they could do it.  However, they told me they couldnt take my measurements, which makes no sense since they do tailoring.  As a result of this experience, Ive decided not to take any of my dry cleaning here...considering I wear suits pretty much every day, theyve lost a lot of business because they didnt want to take 5 minutes to take a free measurement.

20080406 18:45:20 nbsp I used this place for my regular dry cleaning needs for several years, and I loved it.  The service was excellent.  The woman at the counter always remembered me and asked me about school, etc.  After my mom dropped of my cleaning one time, she always asked how my mom was doing.  The prices are similar to the prices Ive found in Sacramento, but the service at El Macero was definitely better than the places Ive tried in Sac.  Twice I dropped off cardigans that were missing buttons, and they replaced them without me asking and free of charge.  I highly recommend this place, especially if you want a dependable neighborhood cleaners that you plan on frequenting often.   Users/emilynewton

20090303 17:26:32 nbsp Just picked my dry cleaning this afternoon.  I had a couple of suits that I needed for work.  This is a fabulous place!  Great service, convenient and reasonably priced.  The lady who helped me provided prompt service and is very, very pleasant.  I plan on becoming a regular.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20110430 23:51:30 nbsp I find it odd that the two sets of positive comments are on the exact same day, and done only a few hours of each other. I hope that they are real and not done by the business themselves. I do plan on giving El Macero Cleaners a try some time next week, since it is conveniently near my home.  Users/fg84
