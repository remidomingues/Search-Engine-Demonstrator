El Macero Country Club was founded in 1961 by C. Bruce Mace as part of the El Macero property development. In 1966, the members purchased the club from the Mace family and it became a proprietary position facility as a California NonProfit Corporation. El Macero Country Club is located near Davis, about 10 miles west of Sacramento, in Yolo County. The club, and its golf course, meander through the El Macero development and encompass about 168 acres within beautiful residential surroundings. The entrance to the club is off Mace Boulevard, approximately a mile south of Interstate 80.

This is the Secret clubhouse for everyone who golfs at El Macero.  In addition to the 18hole championship golf course, the club has a heated swimming pool, two recently resurfaced tennis courts, a formal and casual dining area and social events through out the year.  The Club offers Proprietary Golf, Junior Golf and Social NonGolf Memberships. All memberships require an initiation fee and monthly dues and food and beverage minimums vary based upon which membership you are interested in.

Many often assume that you have to be a resident of El Maceroto join the El Macero Country Club; however that is not the case.  Anyone who has enough $$ can join El Macero Country Club, and members come from all over the Sacramento region.

El Macero Country Club is also open to outside events including weddings, meetings and tournaments.  There is an event coordinator on site who is able to assist with all of your planning needs.
