20070319 13:36:56 nbsp I checked out this place today  got a chicken burrito and a fish taco.  The fish taco was a doublelayered large softtaco shell, with deep fried fish, white sauce, cabbage, and a mild tomatoonion salsa.  The chicken burrito has very little rice or beans, but rather seems to be mostly chicken, salsa, and guac.  This gives it a flavor different from most burritos Ive had in this area.  Both the fish taco and the chicken burrito were tasty.  Also included were some small containers of spicy salsa that is excellent.  Overall, a good place to eat for lunch  relatively inexpensive, with great quality vs. price ratio.  I will have to come back and check out some other items on the menu. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070319 14:58:10 nbsp Having lived in San Diego for 5 years Im always searching for a carneasada burrito that matches ones that are so abundant down there. That is basically a burrito with only carneasada, guacamole, and maybe some cheese and pico de gallo. No rice or beans. Near Davis, El Patio is closest Ive found to that. Users/JimEvans

20070616 11:01:09 nbsp Slow service and way expensive for what you get.  Chips do NOT come with burritos.  They also do not have any salsa for your chips, if you choose to pay for them.  Reg. Chicken Burrito, Chips (with no salsa), and a Fountain Soda will cost you over $8.  Screw that! Users/CaseyBarc

20070713 21:34:00 nbsp The fish burrito here is very, very good, and not overly expensive at $4.50.  Basically, its a tortilla filled with fish, some pico de gallo, and cabbage, along with a very tasty white sauce (no idea what it is).  It typically comes with 24 lime wedges and a couple little containers of hot sauce.  With the lime and the hot sauce, its fantastic. Users/AlexPomeranz
