wiki:woodland:El Torito Meat Market is a butchers butcher shop.


20100527 16:39:57 nbsp This place is a meaty little paradise, a real gem, and a secret I shouldnt be sharing with the rest of Davis. We looked all around for the best carniceria and this was it! One pound wont be enough, so order at least a couple or more pounds of the top sirloin or the arrachera (if they have any left), and be sure to get it seasoned, and youll have some awesome carne asada. We grill it for about 23 minutes per side. You dont get much better than this. They also have super cheap and good tacos. Dont feel bad about going in there and acting like a total gringo, I do it all the time. Sometimes there is a line for the meat counter, definitely worth waiting a few minutes.

You can also grab some http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapat%C3%ADo_hot_sauce Tapatio for the road, last time I went there it was 2/$1 of the small bottles.

If anyone has any more information on what the various cuts of beef and other meat available are specifically for, please share that information along with some good recipes. Users/GarrettGallegos
