What most interests you in serving on this Board?
I rely on the Coop to help me shop, eat and live better.  I can’t grow my own food or raise my own livestock, for example, but I can support those who do it for me.  I feel that the Coop contributes a great deal not only to me but to my community, and I welcome the opportunity to give back.

Are you able to commit hours each week to Board and task force work?
Absolutely.

What other boards or committees have you served on (and your dates of service)?
I am currently serving on my homeowners’ association board.  I have also been involved in industry group committees and task forces for the past 10 years.

What is your professional / career background?
I have a degree in Earth Systems Science and Policy from CSU Monterey Bay.  I spent 8 years as a compliance specialist for the mining and construction industries, and am currently an environmental consultant working out of Sacramento.  I also spent several years as a volunteer for The Marine Mammal Center triage site in Moss Landing.

Dina Biscottis statement:

I am running for the Davis Food Coop Board of Directors because I would like to give back to an organization which adds so much to our community.  I have been a member of the Davis Food Coop for almost ten years. I am particularly proud of the ways in which our Coop prominently displays locallyproduced products so that we can make choices to support our local foodshed.  I am also very pleased with the Coop’s excellent worker safety record and am grateful to the dedicated workers who work daily to make our store what it is.  Some of my volunteer activities include coteaching a local foods cooking class through the U.C. Davis Experimental College with members of the U.C. Davis Students for Sustainable Agriculture and serving as a mentor through the U.C. Davis Guardian Scholars Program and the U.C. Berkeley Labor Summer Program.  I love taking cooking classes at the Coop, participating in community events like the Coop Souper Bowl, and reading the Q&A Suggestion Box section of the Coop newsletter.

This year I will complete my Ph.D. in Sociology at U.C. Davis.  My doctoral research is focused on organizations and I teach about cooperative organizations in undergraduate Sociology courses at U.C. Davis.  My research interests include the ordering of our food system and I have presented some of my research at the joint meetings of the Agriculture, Food & Human Values Society and the Association for the Study of Food and Society.  Prior to attending graduate school I gained financial management and budgeting skills working in administrative positions at the U.C. San Diego School of Medicine and Stanford University School of Medicine.  I have also worked in food service at four restaurants.  As a member of the Coop Board of Directors I would work collaboratively with the other members of the board to responsibly serve our membership as guided by the cooperative principles.  Thank you for your support.

 Running for the Board 

You must be a Coop shareholder in good standing to serve on the Board. If youre a member of a shareholders household now, but dont own shares, you can run. If youre elected, you must purchase your own shares in order to serve.

For more information on eligibility, please read the http://www.davisfood.coop/Candidate_Packet_3_31_10.pdf Candidates Packet, Yes, I want to be a Candidate... (a PDF file). You will need to fill out a http://www.davisfood.coop/Declare_Candidacy_2_26_10.pdf Declaration of Candidacy form (a PDF file) to run. Candidates can declare up to the last day of the election, May 28.

 Voters Pamphlet 
http://www.davisfood.coop/Voters_Pam_4_2010.pdf The Voters Pamphlet is available on line. You will find complete voting information in it on pages 1 and 2. Youll also find information about the http://www.davisfood.coop/propositions.html Ballot Proposition and the statements of the Candidates  except for writein Franklin Fox.

 Democratic Engagement 
Sometimes members wonder about how a DFC election is run. Theres a lot of information available on line (as indicated by all the above links), but many of the nuts and bolts are described in http://www.davisfood.coop/admin_policies.html#elections the Election Policy adopted by the Coop Board in March 2008. Most of the text of the Policy is quite a bit older, dating in many parts to the 1980s.

The wiki was heavily used for Q&A and debate in the Davis Food Coop/Election 2008 2008 and Davis Food Coop/Election 2009 2009 elections as a public forum by the candidates and general public. The http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html Coop Election Central page links to this page, so this can be used the same way this year. You are encouraged to submit questions below, and perhaps candidates will respond. Please contact the elections committee through the http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html Coop Election Central page if you need help editing or posting to this page.


20100428 20:57:05 nbsp Its Davis Food Coop election time. As a member of the DFC board for a many years here is how I am voting:

Kevin Wolf
Stephen Reynolds
Theodora Conslacion
Dina Biscotti

Please do NOT vote for Michael Pach. Mr. Pach is trying to get the DFC to engage in activities far beyond the scope of the DFCs purpose. This type of activity is what helped kill the Berkeley Food Coop.

Thanks for voting!  Jack Young Users/jackyoungdfc

 Im confused.  Do you mean M. Pach?  or is his name spelled wrong in the article section?  Users/rocksanddirt

20100505 05:01:49 nbsp A few comments from the sidelines: a) The board needs more concern for coop values over and against its present groupthink/profitoverprinciples character. b) Policy Governance is an emperor without clothes (try reading documents on this and youll see what I mean); anyone advocating such nonsense is a mountebank. c) Its faulty logic and fear mongering to say a little infusion of principlemindedness would be a Berkeley coop breakup redux. Popper called this type of thinking the poverty of historicism, and we ought to take heed: just because something happened in the past does not mean we are fated to have it happen again! The DFC is a different ball of wax. d) Dont forget to vote in concentrated blocs! The voting scheme for DFC elections is prone to dilution if you use all your votes. I would name the two people Im voting for, but given my election performances, I doubt theyd want my advocacy ;) Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20100510 08:59:39 nbsp The ballot is simple this year, but for those of you who want them, here are my opinions.

Candidates
I will be voting for Rebecca Hager, Teddy Consolacion, Steve Reynolds and Dina Biscotti.  I believe that all four of these folks will do their level best to continue the work of the Board. I think they are all interested in representing everyone who shops the Coop, and in making sure that our first duty – running a profitable business properly and legally – is met.

Proposition
There’s only one proposition this year, and it simply corrects a conflict in our bylaws where one paragraph sets a date and another paragraph sets a different date for the same thing. Please vote “yes” so we can resolve the issue.

20100523 21:08:14 nbsp Last few days  balloting ends at 10 PM on Friday, May 28, and ballot envelopes must either be IN the ballot box in the store, or USPS postmarked by that date to be included in the count. Dont procrastinate: please, if youre going to vote (and are eligible) do it NOW. Users/DougWalter
