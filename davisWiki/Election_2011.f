The Davis Food Coop election began April 14, with delivery of Election Materials to mailboxes of some Davis members, and ended on June 10. Lots of information is already available at http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html the Coops page about elections. Friday, June 10, 2011 was the last day to vote (see note below about why the last day to vote has changed). In addition to voting for Directors, shareholders in good standing are voting on Proposition 1, Initiatives, as placed on the ballot at the March 11, 2011 Special Board of Directors meeting.

Below is the 2011 Election Calendar (also available at http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html#calendar the Coop web site):


 Last day to vote has been extended until June 10, 2011 

The Davis Food Coop in downtown Davis, has announced that the deadline for voting in the annual election has been extended until June 10, 2011.

General Manager Eric Stromberg announced the extension, saying it was authorized by a unanimous resolution of the Coop Board of Directors, in response to a typographical error in the materials sent to shareholders in good standing. The error is in line 15 of Section B of the proposed amendment to the Coops Bylaws that is being voted on as Proposition 1.

The Pamphlet reads in part, ...by special election within six 12 months... The http://www.davisfood.coop/propositions.html correct language should read, ...by special election within 12 months.

Making the announcement of the extension, Stromberg said, the error is a result of having many drafts before the language became final, and we regret that we didnt catch it. In case anyone became confused by the error, he continued, we want to make sure members understand that they can change their vote, and they have two more weeks to do so.

If the correction causes a shareholder to reconsider their vote, Stromberg said they may cast a replacement ballot by filling out a new ballot, writing the date on the ballot envelope, and noting on the envelope that it supersedes the previous vote. http://www.davisfood.coop/images/Candidates_2011/Ballot_for_web_5_10_11.pdf Ballots and http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html#voting_instructions complete voting instructions are available online, and in the store (at the Ballot Box). Ballots for the Coop election must be now be received by close of business – 10 PM – or postmarked on or before June 10, 2011.

 Declared Candidates for Director 

Shareholders in good standing on 6/10/11 may vote for up to three candidates. There are three threeyear terms open on the Board of Directors. In addition, two Alternate Directors will be seated for one year, to vote if a Director is absent. The Candidates with the three highest vote totals will fill the threeyear terms, and the fourth and fifth will fill terms as First and Second Alternate. As of 4/12/11, six Coop members have declared their Candidacy; see below for details on how to declare candidacy.

On 4/2/11, three Coop employees conducted a random drawing (with a hat!) to place the Candidates in a random order on the Spring Election ballot. Writein candidates are added at the bottom of the ballot as they declare candidacy.

See below for information about becoming a writein candidate.

 Running for the Board 

You must be a Coop shareholder in good standing to serve on the Board. If youre a member of a shareholders household now, but dont own shares, you can run. If youre elected, you must purchase your own shares in order to serve.

For more information on eligibility, or on becoming a writein candidate, please read the http://www.davisfood.coop/Candidate_Packet%203_1_11.pdf Candidates Packet (a PDF file), Yes, I want to be a Candidate... (a PDF file). You will need to fill out a http://www.davisfood.coop/Declare_Candidacy_2_11.pdf Declaration of Candidacy form (a PDF file) to run. Candidates can declare up to the last day of the election, June 10.

 Voters Pamphlet 
The Voters Pamphlet deadline was 4/1/11; it is http://www.davisfood.coop/images/Candidates_2011/Voters_Pam_4_3_11.pdf available (as a PDF file), although all the information in it is available http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html on the Coop web site when you follow all the links. You will find extensive voting information in it on pages 1 and 2 (although theres http://www.davisfood.coop/admin_policies.html#elections more to read if you want it). Youll also find information about the http://www.davisfood.coop/propositions.html Ballot Proposition and the http://www.davisfood.coop/candidates.html statements of the Candidates.

 Democratic Engagement 
Sometimes members wonder about how a DFC election is run. Theres a lot of information available on line (as indicated by all the above links), but many of the nuts and bolts are described in http://www.davisfood.coop/admin_policies.html#elections the Election Policy adopted by the Coop Board in March 2008, and revised a little in October 2010. Most of the text of the Policy is quite a bit older, dating in many parts to the 1980s.

Endorsements have been a feature of many past Coop elections. At least one shareholder has posted her preferences on the Election display in the Coop for the past nine years, although an anonymous correspondent thought this was a possible irregularity. Reading http://www.davisfood.coop/admin_policies.html#elections the Election Policy, you will see references to providing space for endorsements in Sections 2.1, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.

Several candidates for Director used the Davis Food Coop/Election 2010 2010 page to post information for voters. The wiki was heavily used in the Davis Food Coop/Election 2008 2008 and Davis Food Coop/Election 2009 2009 elections as a public forum by the candidates and general public. The http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html Coop Election Central page links to this page, so this can be used the same way this year. You are encouraged to submit questions below, and perhaps candidates will respond. Please contact the elections committee through the http://www.davisfood.coop/election.html Coop Election Central page if you need help editing or posting to this page.

20110416 09:58:08 nbsp Not wanting to start controversy... genuinely seeking information... is the Palestine/Israel debate a factor in this years election? Users/CovertProfessor
  There is no explicit mention of it in any published statement by any of the six candidates. Youre free to attend the Annual Meeting on 5/22 (although tickets are required for dinner), and you could ask them about their feelings. Or they may edit their entries here on this wiki page. Two Directors (http://www.davisfood.coop/candidates.html#J_Booth J. Booth and http://www.davisfood.coop/candidates.html#S_Frerichs S. Frerichs) who are running for reelection both were part of the unanimous decisions in February and March 2010 to keep a boycott initiative off the ballot (the third incumbent, http://www.davisfood.coop/candidates.html#F_Fox F. Fox, is an Alternate Director, and wasnt on the Board until July 2010, but his past position was also pretty clearly against a boycott). Users/DougWalter
   Thank you  thats helpful, and Ill continue to listen to see how things develop.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110613 09:39:25 nbsp Now that the election is done (except for the 6/20 Board meeting where results are accepted), I have magically regained opinions (this is an attempt at humor). In the store, on the Election bulletin board, someone wrote a comment saying Proposition 1 seemed to have something to do with the 2010 Palestine/Israel debate (referenced at Davis Food Coop/Boycott, Divestment, And Sanctions)  but they couldnt tell which side it was from.

The Proposition was fashioned by a lawyer working at the direction of the Board; my observation is that they were hoping for a proposal that wasnt for either side, but for the Coop. I believe they hope this proposal will make future debates more structured by Bylaws, and so subject future initiative proposals to more structure, both technical (dates, procedures for submitting signatures) and strategic. Time will tell, but I think all that language will provide more framework for the exercise of discretion and judgement by future Directors. Thats in contrast to Spring 2010, where (IMO) they were bound, guided, and inspired only by the twin concepts of legal and proper  which leaves a lot of discretion and judgement to exercise!
