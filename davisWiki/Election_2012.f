 Bernie Goldsmith 

Dear friends and fellow members; I am writing to ask for your vote for board member of the Davis Food Coop. I am running because I believe strongly in the DFC and its role in our community, and because I offer skills, experience, and the drive we need to face coming competition and strengthen our cooperative.

I can contribute to our board in three important ways: as a business attorney who understands the needs of a large organization; as a longtime Davisite who has been a member of the DFC for most of my life; and as a deeply involved and engaged citizenactivist who strives to promote local reliance and the cooperative model.

My primary goal as director would be to strengthen the two qualities that I think make the DFC such a resilient institution and strong force for good in our town: its commitment to promoting and providing local, sustainable food and its responsiveness to the concerns and values of its members.

I believe in the cooperative model and in local reliance for food, finance, housing, and healthcare. I believe that economic and environmental sustainability must go handinhand, and that strong investment in the community and in local farms will result in a stronger food cooperative.

Organizations I have volunteered for, advised, or served include the Solar Community Housing Association, the UCD Domes, the Flatland Food Collective, Davis Farm to School, and multiple organic farms. Most recently, I cofounded the Davis Flea Market, served our County by handling the estates of those who died indigent and alone, and helped to reduce our city’s carbon footprint as a core team member of the Cool Davis Initiative. I currently serve as a commissioner on the city’s Business and Economic Development Commission.

It is my hope to continue this work by serving on the Davis Food Coop board, and I would greatly appreciate your vote.

 Desmond Jolly 

This year has been named International Year of Cooperatives by the United Nations. It also marks the 40th Anniversary of the Davis Food Cooperative — quite a remarkable testament to its sustainability over these four decades. The future sustainability of the Coop is largely what motivates my efforts as a member of the Board of Directors. We are in the midst of a radically more challenging and competitive marketing environment. Several new grocery stores have located to Davis in the last few years, and we can reasonably expect several more to do so in the coming years. Davis, after all, is a fairly stable, upscale market.

The stability of the Coop requires an adaptive as well as an innovative approach. And while the Board does not involve itself in the management of the store (that is delegated to a manager and staff), the Board can foster a climate of innovation which empowers the management and staff to innovate and adapt so as to keep the Coop on the cutting edge in terms of meeting our shoppers needs, while preserving the traditional “folksiness” which has been a hallmark of the Coop.

I have tried to bring to the board a renewed sense of cooperation between the Board and the management and to foster a heightened sense of teamwork. I believe we must pull strongly together to keep the organization strong and financially viable. The Board can ensure and reinforce the preeminent values of our memberowners: that we support local producers and vendors as well as more sustainable food systems and environments by emphasizing sustainably produced products such as organically produced foods, including sustainably harvested fish.

Since joining the Board I have helped rewrite our Ends ­— basically our Guiding Principles — been twice Election Task Force Chair and now, Chair of Board Education. I was instrumental in getting the Board more engaged in Strategic Leadership in addition to Policy Governance.

I wish to continue helping to provide leadership and stewardship on your behalf.

Thank you for your past support.

 Ed Clemens 

Hello Fellow Coop owners. During the 8 years that I have been a member of the DFC, it has become an increasingly more significant part of my life. The recognition of this stems from my growing awareness of how much I’ve changed the way I live as a result of being a Coop member. I used to drive to the Coop almost exclusively and it took many months before I finally got into the habit of bringing my own reusable bags. I now make 99% of my trips to the Coop on my bike, towing my Coop trailer containing cloth bags and recycled containers. But it’s not about saving the nickel per bag that prompted this change. It’s the values the Coop endorses by implementing policies that encourage people to participate in a healthy sustainable lifestyle and to be part of a socially active community, that I find motivating.

I am running for a BOD position to support and develop the policies that have made the DFC a model viable community enterprise. The experiences I have that guide my decisions and reflect my values and skills are:
• Director of a multidisciplinary science program at UCSC. Focused on increasing the number of ethnic minorities prepared with a science degree to make policies that promote equity. Collaborated with diverse groups of people to create programs that achieved these goals.
• Director of pharmacology programs for several biotech companies. Gained experience working through the many personnel issues associated with an industry always in transition. Recognized health isn’t about drugs, it is about the foods we eat and the friends we make.
• Treasurer of Slow Food Yolo for three years. Managed the financial aspects of this organization that supports sustainable agriculture.
• Coordinator and active participant in the Tour de Cluck  a community activity that supports Farm to School programs. Worked with many people to help participants enjoy a multifaceted community event.
• Volunteer for the DFC Holiday Meal and Souper Bowl  this connects me with good people.

Thank you for reading my statement. I would appreciate your vote.

 Travis Breckon 

My name is Travis Breckon. I have served on the Davis Food Coop Board for the last year as an alternate board member and have greatly enjoyed getting to know the other Board members while attending meetings as well as the annual Coop training and retreat. I especially enjoyed helping cook at the annual Coop social event.

As I mentioned last year when I was running, I graduated from CSUS and have worked in various fields. I have approximately six years’ experience working for a retail grocery market and have lived and worked on a cattle ranch. Because of my experience and being the main shopper in our household, I appreciate that the Davis Food Coop supplies the best selection and quality of organic foods and meats in the area from local vendors.

Since Whole Foods has made the decision to come into the Davis area, I feel that the Coop needs to meet the challenges necessary for us to stay competitive and maintain the wonderful quality, service, and reputation that has been ours for years.

Finally, I believe that I have excellent interpersonal skills. I enjoy working with people and being a team player. In my spare time, I maintain bee hives and construct acoustic guitars – and have been the electric and acoustic guitarist in several local bands.

As a person who is passionate about quality food and the Coop’s continued place in this community, I thank you for your vote last year and ask for your vote again this year

 Karen Mo (withdrawn) 

On May 9, 2012, Karen Mo withdrew her candidacy for the Coop Board, due to other time commitments.

She wrote, “I really felt I could contribute, but at this time it seems like my life is too full. I feel confident that your current board & the many outstanding other candidates will continue to maintain the coop I love.”

Shareholders can still vote for up to four candidates among the six remaining. You may change your vote, until the end of the election. Write the date on the front of your envelope, and that the ballot enclosed supersedes your previous vote. Your new envelope must be signed and sealed, and your name (& member number) should be legibly printed. We cannot combine votes from two ballots.

 Zoë Plakias 

Dear fellow Coop member owners – thank you for voting in the 2012 election for the Board of Directors. As you know, it is your right and privilege to determine who governs the business that you own.

I believe supporting cooperatives like the Davis Food Coop is one of the best ways to maintain a vibrant local and global community. Over the last six months, I have had the pleasure to serve on the Member Linkage Task Force at the Davis Food Coop. Before moving to Davis, I also served on boards or committees of two other retail food cooperatives. I hope to use my experience and drive to help carry on the long tradition of cooperative enterprise that is unique to Davis.

While I am eager to participate in discussions of all issues brought before the Board of Directors, there are several causes I hope to champion. First, I believe constant dialogue with and excellent service to member owners is essential both to meeting the principles for which the Coop stands and for the success of the Coop as a business. As a member of the Board of Directors I will push for the highest standards of customer service and work to open new channels of communication with member owners. Secondly, if elected to the Board of Directors, I will look for ways to bring greater socioeconomic diversity to the Coop community, as I understand the economic constraints faced by the Coop and by member owners. Throughout, paramount in my mind will be the Coop’s ideal of being a competitive, communityrooted, retail food store carrying a large selection of high quality, responsibly sourced products.

Beyond the Coop, as my “day job,” I am a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis. I feel privileged to work on food and agriculture issues that I am passionate about both in my academic work and in my community.

Thanks for your consideration and for your many contributions to the Davis Food Coop. See you in the checkout line!

 Bija Young 

The Davis Food Coop has been a part of my family since 1999, after the birth of my first son. I truly value the strong sense of community that the Davis Food Coop fosters as well as the willingness to be a leader in promoting and supporting environmental stewardship, local businesses and producers. I strongly believe in supporting a sustainable, local economy as an alternative to the big corporations that put profit before people.

I have been involved with food cooperatives since 1996, when I first volunteered at Sacramento Natural Foods Coop. Since then I have been a member, volunteer and employee at three different coops in two states. Currently I am employed by DFC in the Marketing Dept., as the Brand Manager. It is in this capacity that I have learned to look at the bigger picture of the Coop and what it needs to survive and thrive.

I have participated in numerous cooperative and community based enterprises from starting a housing community when I was a single mom to cocreating an alternative school in Portland, OR. Throughout these endeavors I have learned how to communicate and problem solve effectively within diverse groups to achieve results.

If elected to the Board I would like to focus on the dialog between memberowners and the Board. It is my belief that more involvement from owners, along with greater accessibility to the board will lead to greater pride of ownership, which will in turn lead to the overall success of the Coop.
