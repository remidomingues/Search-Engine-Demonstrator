 Brietta Oaks 

When I consider the reasons why I love living in Davis, the fact that we have a food coop is unquestionably the foundation upon which I begin. A food coop provides so much more than just a place to buy groceries—it’s a place that makes it easier to buy foods that are organic, fair trade, and local; a place that provides information about food and nutrition to its members through newsletters, pamphlets, and the Teaching Kitchen; and a place to just hang out and eat lunch. But more than anything, it’s a community.

As a member of this community, this past year I have been writing for the coop newsletter, The Vine, and have greatly enjoyed it. When I write an article, my main hope is that I am empowering Coop members with new information. I now am applying to serve as a director on the board of the Davis Food Coop with this same goal of empowering Coop members. If elected to the board, I will work on improving communication of board discussions and decisions to members atlarge. I also plan to address the fact that several new grocery stores have opened up around us, and I would like to ensure that the coop is making decisions that will help it continue to thrive and improve in light of this new competition.

I currently live in Muir Commons cohousing, where I am also a board member, so I have ample experience with discussions focused on achieving consensus. I am also a mom of two children, a parent at a cooperative preschool, and a Ph.D. student in nutrition, so I have developed a strong interest in the quality and integrity of the food we eat. I believe all of these aspects will enable me to be a thoughtful and attentive director. I look forward to the chance to be a part of new possibilities at the Coop and thank you for your support.

 Diane Parro 

I love food and I love the Davis Food Coop. I feel very fortunate to live in a place where locally grown food is fresh, delicious, and abundant.

I have become increasingly interested in food and cooking is definitely my creative outlet. I experiment with ingredients I find in the bulk section as well as other departments and I have really enjoyed Coop cooking classes. I want to serve on the Board of Directors because I would like to put my passion for food toward good work in our shared community.

As Deputy to Yolo County Supervisor Don Saylor, I work on many pressing issues facing our residents but food access is the topic about which I feel most strongly. I have focused on learning about our food system and am trying to understand how we can increase the economic benefit of agriculture in our region. At the same time, I believe that every person needs good healthy food and we have it in abundance so we need to figure out how everyone can get enough. I am a participant in Yolo Food Connect which is a group made up of a large number of people from many varied organizations working together on issues of food access. The Davis Food Coop is a great community partner and actively supports many programs addressing food insecurity. I think my energy and enthusiasm would make a worthwhile contribution to these efforts.

I have experience that makes me qualified for this position. I am currently on the Board of the Davis Farmers Market and have served as President of the Board at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis. I have a good understanding of policy based governance and while I held the position of Executive Director at the Yolo County Visitors Bureau, I worked very closely with the Board.

I am an outgoing, optimistic resident of Davis and would like you to vote for me!

 L. Edward Clemens 

Hello Fellow Coop owners. I have been a member of the Davis Food Coop for 9 years. This past year I had the privilege of serving on the Board of Directors as the 1st alternate. What I’ve learned is that the Coop is a very complex organization. It is not just a food store – it is a member owned, cooperatively managed business that operates with specific goals that extend beyond the task of putting products on shelves. The decisions the board of directors makes are guided by the policies that require the business to be financially stable, to provide high quality food choices, to support our staff, to minimize our impact on the environment, to offer educational opportunities for our staff and members, to benefit our local producers and help foster the wellbeing of our community. Doing all this in a business that operates on a 1% profit margin is not easy. And – doing these things well, is what makes the DFC special.

I am running for a BOD position to support and develop the policies that have made the DFC a model viable community enterprise. During the next few years I will ask the BOD to work on policies that will broaden the economic range of it’s membership/customer base and to enhance educational opportunities for our staff and membership. The experiences I have that guide my decisions and reflect my values and skills are:

• One year’s experience as a member of the BOD. Familiarity with the Coop’s End Policies, financial statements, Open Book Management, and review processes.

• Director of a multidisciplinary science program at UCSC. Focused on increasing the number of ethnic minorities prepared, with a science degree, to make policies that promote equity.

• Coordinator and active participant in the Tour de Cluck  a community activity that supports Farm to School programs. Worked with many people to help participants enjoy a multifaceted community event.

• Volunteer for the DFC Holiday Meal and Souper Bowl  this connects me with good people.

Thank you for reading my statement. I would appreciate your vote.

 Scott Lay 

Thank you for caring about our Coop and reading my candidate’s statement. I am running for the Coop Board of Directors not because I have a specific issue or complaint but because I want to serve an institution that I love and patronize nearly daily.

I am the President/CEO of the Community College League of California (“League”), an ethicsbased and entrepreneurial organization, like our Coop. I’ve been fortunate to work at the League for 18 years and have led the organization of 16 staff members for 6.5 years. I answer to a board, oversee a budget of over $3 million, organized under a 501(c)(3) umbrella.

I have lived in Davis for 18 years, and now live in the Coop’s neighborhood. I Iove walking to our Coop to purchase everything for local and sustainable meals. Before law school, I was a Superworker, and now seek to continue my involvement.

Perhaps the biggest current challenge of governing our Coop is the competition of corporations that have sought to replicate our Coop’s community valuesfocused business model. This trend may have been a win for our personal values but has created strong competition that will require continued vigilance to ensure progress toward the ideals we share.

As I was debating whether to file my candidacy, news came that one of our locally owned coffee shops may be swallowed by the green monster, which encouraged my filing.

To succeed in this new marketplace, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that our Coop is an educational and community center of people that share our common values. We need to celebrate and expand community events at and around the Coop, while ensuring that our members seeking to do their daily shopping at the Coop are not too adversely impacted.

We also cannot be too troubled by temporarily declining sales. Yes, at the end of the day, the Coop is a valuescentered business and must balance its books. However, with oversight by a policyfocused board and strong operational leadership, the best days for our Coop are ahead.

 Bernie Goldsmith 

Dear friends and fellow members,

Last year, I was elected to serve a one year term as a director; I am writing to ask for your vote once again to continue to serve for a full term.

In this last year I have contributed to the board in three important ways: as an attorney who understands the needs of a large organization; as a longtime davisite who has been a member of the DFC for most of my life; and as a deeply involved and engaged citizenactivist who strives to promote local reliance and the cooperative model.

A good board is a wellrounded board, with directors representing certain vital skillsets. This year we will see the departure of the only other attorney on the board, Stephen Reynolds. Our cooperative needs at least one attorney on the board to function at its best; there are several specific matters currently before us which require an attorney’s knowledge and judgment. This is why I am running.

We have a close relationship with our local farmers, but I would like to see our cooperative take that to the next level, by taking an even more active role in incubating and encouraging more small local farm startups just outside of our city limits. I also believe we can better leverage our institution to encourage the creation of popup restaurants, guest kitchens, and other small, innovated foodrelated startups.

I believe a sustainable business is one which provides reasonable benefits and a living wage to its employees. If elected, I will explore our options for novel ways to achieve sustainable employee compensation and benefits.

I believe in the cooperative model and in local reliance for food, finance, housing, and healthcare. I believe that economic and environmental sustainability must go handinhand, and that strong investment in the community and in local farms will result in a stronger food cooperative.

Organizations I have volunteered for, advised, or served include the Solar Community Housing Association, the Domes, the Tricooperatives on campus, Davis Farm to School, and multiple organic farms. It is my hope to continue my work on the Davis Food Coop board. I would greatly appreciate your vote.

Thank you.

Please cast your vote for me as a candidate for Board member on your Davis Food Coop ballot. I, Frank Fox, and my wife, Moreen Libet, have been members of the DFC since 1983. I served on the board for two years prior initially winning as a write in alternate in 201011 and then winning as an alternate again and 201112.

The Coop has always been our first choice for shopping since we arrived in Davis. We were members of the Berkeley Coop in the 70’s. We sadly witnessed its demise due to political divisiveness. The Coop in Berkeley spread itself thin and lost sight of the real reason for its existence – providing high quality, wholesome food in a cooperative, nonprofit environment.

This is my vision and my agenda – let’s keep the Coop about good healthy products, and value our access to the bounties our region offers us in seasonal produce, with fairtrade options, responding to shoppers/members/owners questions and needs. I love bagging my own groceries and buying from the bulk sections, meeting and greeting neighbors old and new, and even dancing and singing along with the great music. I love how students in our community want to work here. I am in favor of providing people with opportunities to work in our Coop, with decent benefits and a positive work experience.

We all believe in democracy and support human rights, and we all have our own ideas on how to solve the world’s conflicts and ease suffering. I want the Coop to remain our nonprofit, cooperative grocery store, and not lose it because of disagreements about world politics.

I will work hard to keep the Coop about good, healthy, nutritious, fairtrade, fair work, fair prices, and keeping our community healthy and informed about health, nutrition, taste, and the politics of food. I will also bring to the Board my experience as an educational administrator, program evaluator, researcher, teacher, performing artist former arts in public places commissioner, and Coop superworker.

Please join me in helping us protect the reasons we belong to the Coop.
