 Users/AlyssaOlenberg Alyssa 0.02 GPA Olenberg

 Notes 
Some might object to Rood running, seeing as he is no longer a student, but the Elections Committee is already preparing an official statement for after the election: It has come to our attention that one of the candidates was not properly checked for eligibility at the beginning of the election. This is an unfortunate mistake, but, well he did get all those votes so I guess we have to give him the seat, because if the elections committee would have just told him he wasnt a student at in the beginning, we think he would have enrolled and would have been eligible and still won.

The Elections Committee Slate is not to be mistaken for SOSSS

 Platform 

  Maintain the disenfranchisement of graduate students, which is one reason why Brent Laabs cannot run on their slate.
  Official ASUCD Voting Machines by wiki:wikipedia:Diebold Election Systems Diebold: Users/ChristopherMcKenzie has been declared their official liaison to Diebold
  While SOSSS encouraged people to vote in a particular order, this slate wants to mandate ranking orders for all voters, and make voting compulsory.  Except for Brent.  He still cant vote.
  Transform ASUCD into an explicit Kleptocracy, and purchase an Elections Committee Kleptocmobile.
  A huge raise for Alex Park and the rest of Creative Media, because its not who votes that counts, it who counts the votes.
  Replace Sword and Sandals with Masonic Temple Freemasonry as the official secret society of ASUCD. There were at least 15 US wiki:wikipedia:List_of_Freemasons#U.S._Presidents Presidents who were Masons; how many were in Sword and Sandals? Their official representative to the Masons is Users/BarnabasTruman.

EMOSNAIL: The staff here at Emosnail would like to recognize that this ingenius act of satire brilliantly combines parallels to Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Unqualified Candidates Scandal current events with extreme hilarity. We therefore would like to award this satire with the highest honours, The Sacred Order of Trogdor ... This of course does not in any way constitute an endorsement of the intended political implications of the satire or the political goals of persons associated with it.

as per the EMOSNAIL user agreement, the slate will upon election pass a resolution proclaiming the unequaled beauty of Miss Kristy Heidenberger.

Rafi Alimahomed: Im a bad little boy
