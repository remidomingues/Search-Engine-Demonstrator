20050216 18:13:40 nbsp I believe we (Friends Urging Campus Kindness) took the idea for wireless printing stations from LEADs platform last quarter.  Other than that, I think a lot of ideas were stolen from our Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform platform.  Were only talking about open government because all of these people bought plasma screens and door hanger bills get put through as urgent legislation.  Also, I thought it was funny that The California Aggie http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/16/FrontPage/Focus.Presidential.Candidates.Eye.Future1319603.shtml?norewrite200607290305&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com cites them for wanting to dissolve Health and Wellbeing, but Cindy Yu uses it as a qualification.
