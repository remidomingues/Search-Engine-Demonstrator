The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers two major courses of study: 1) Electrical Engineering (EE), and 2) Computer Engineering (CE). The Electrical Engineering/Materials Science Engineering major was moved to the Chemical and Materials Science Engineering department in 2006.  Both majors are ABETaccredited. The department is based out of Kemper Hall with their office on the second floor in the east wing.  It is a part of the College of Engineering.

Note that the departmental threeletter code for courses is EEC (not ECE), for Engineering: Electrical and Computer. Plenty of professors use ECE on syllabi, however.


 Undergraduate Program 
The department offers Bachelors of Science (BS) degrees in the three courses of study listed above.

There is some overlap between the CE program in this department and the CSE program in the Computer Science department. Both require courses in hardware and software but CE has greater focus on electronics (e.g. electromagnetics, device physics) while CSE has greater focus on computer theory (e.g. algorithms, programming languages).

 Degree Requirements 
Like most engineering programs, the degree has strict course requirements and a high unit count. There is annual mandatory http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/undergrad/advising.html academic advising for ECE students to make sure they are on track, especially since requirements may change from yeartoyear.

 Someone with an updated degree checklist want to fill this in?

 Graduate Program 
The department offers Masters of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees. There is also an BS/MS http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/Grads/idp.html integrated degree program (IDP) that allows junior (3rd year) ECE undergrads to apply to the graduate program early and begin graduate coursework in their senior year.

All ECE grad students must take EEC290  ECE Graduate Seminar every fall quarter.

 MS Requirements 
There are two programs that MS students can follow:

Plan I (Thesis) Program:
  36 units (15 units from 200level engineering courses, 12 of which are in ECE, excluding 29x)
  3 quarters academic residence
  MS Thesis
Plan II (Exam) Program
  36 units (24 units from 200level engineering courses, 18 of which are in ECE, excluding 29x)
  3 quarters academic residence
  Comprehensive exam

For more detailed information, see http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/Grads/students/ms.html.

 Ph.D. Requirements 
  45 units (24 100/200level units from ECE excluding 29x, 9 units outside ECE)
  Preliminary Exam
  Qualifying Exam
  Dissertation

 Instructional Facilities 
The ECE department has numerous labs located in Kemper Hall. Except for some of the computer labs, they are all kept locked unless there is a class. Most of the equipment in the larger labs is hooked up to an alarm system to prevent theft. Graduate labs are generally locked at all times by keypad.

  ECE Undergraduate Labs
  http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/microfab/ Microfabrication Lab  Class 100 clean room used for EEC146AB and graduate work. Locked by keypad.

 Research 
ECE has 37 http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/people/departmentalfaculty.html faculty and adjunct faculty members as well as 14 emeritus faculty members. They are involved in http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/research/researchoverview.html research in areas including:
  Communications, Signal and Image Processing
  Computer Engineering
  Electronic Circuits
  Optoelectronics
  RF, Micro and Millimeter Waves
  SolidState Electronic Devices
  Systems and Control

 Courses 
Official course descriptions are available at the http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/Ugrad_classes/ugradindex.html course departments website as well as the http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/programs/EEC/EECcourses.html registrar.
