Electron proAudio is Laurence Hermans sound company. He does both recording (in his studio) and live audio. He does most of the ASUCD Entertainment Council shows, as well as many other shows in and around Davis.

Laurence is a born and raised Davisite, so if you want to hear about the history of the Music Scene hes a good person to talk to.

More importantly, Laurence really knows his shit, so if you want your event to sound good and your bands to be happy, call Laurence.
