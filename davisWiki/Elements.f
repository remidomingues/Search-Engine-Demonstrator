Davis is made up of many things.  As humans do, we often categorize them into basic units and try to trace their structures. From social structures to Davis timeline timelines, we put things into place by their street addresses, and otherwise try to find People fundamental units.  One of these categorical units is an element.  No, not air, water, fire and Geology earth.  Were talking the chemistry chemical elements.  Many are found in Davis, and  using this somewhat localized chart  you can find Davis in them.
