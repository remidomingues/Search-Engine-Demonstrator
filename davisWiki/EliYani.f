I like squirrels.

Oh, I suppose I was once the ASUCD Controller and Treasurer of Phi Alpha Delta.


20111004 16:26:21 nbsp The Tea Party is a bit of a lightning rod these days, as I am sure you know.  Many people are fired up because of it, while others are appalled by it  including many Republicans.  So, I was curious to know whether a universitybased Republican group would take a stand on the Tea Party one way or another, just as I would be curious about the stands of any political group on relevant and controversial issues.  Presumably, this is also information that those interested in joining would want to know.

20111203 13:07:09 nbsp Traditionally, a wiki is entirely composed of commentary.  I.e., the stuff up top is written by people with views, expressing those views.  So is the bottom, its just sometimes easier to toss a oneliner than hit Edit. Ideally, enough people weigh in to balance everything out (sometimes that will mean, if the community as a whole really likes something, the end result will be enthusiastically positive, and visa versa).  In this way, the wiki comes to represent the cumulative viewpoint of the community as a whole.  Wikipedia is not a wiki, but rather a project to write an encyclopedia using wiki software.  They are popular, so theres this mistaken notion that wikis are supposed to be written like encyclopedias (no original research, cite everything, no opinions).  But those notions are all from the pedia part of Wikipedia, not the Wiki half.   If there were a popular Blogpedia with no opinions allowed in the blog posts, it wouldnt follow then that all other blogs must eliminate opinion in their posts.  To try and capture the essence of a community, but to strip all of the community perspective from the topics turns the wiki into a mere listing of trivia and a business database.  And there are better, http://www.google.com/places/ more comprehensive databases out there than the Wiki.  The Wiki is Davis from the Davis perspective. Users/JabberWokky

20111203 13:10:28 nbsp Incidentally, thats also why http://daviswiki.org/Appia_Financial?actionrecall&version6 this version of Appia Financial is considered bad.  It has all the facts, all laid out in a very comprehensive, descriptive manner... and zero insight or community perspective.  It has no soul. Users/JabberWokky

20111203 13:19:05 nbsp Oh, and all of the above is my take on it, some people have different perspectives: the wiki is composed of a myriad of people with different views.  I would hazard that the above take is fairly common, as its been discussed in the past and it is reflected in the content of the wiki. Users/JabberWokky
