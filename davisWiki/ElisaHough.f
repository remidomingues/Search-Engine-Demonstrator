Elisa graduated from UC Davis with a BA in English and minors in technical theatre and ethnomusicology. She was a DJ and publicity director at KDVS, and she probably hit you up for donations at the farmers market or somewhere around town. She lives in Sacramento again but can be seen around Davis for shows and UCD Gamelan Ensemble gamelan.
