20080512 01:56:12 nbsp How about if you put those pictures of the Coffee House and Freeborn Hall facilities on their respective pages or on one and link it from the other?

20090112 17:06:53 nbsp So I did a bit of research in Shields about the history of the building that now houses the Bike Barn. I found a map from October 1911 that showed that the building that is now the Bike Barn did not exist. However, the building that is now the Silo is on the map and it is labeled Cow barn. The map has the call number G4364 D3:2U6 1911. I also found a map from 1923 that does have the building that now houses the Bike Barn. It is labeled Stock Judging Pavillion. The call number for that map is G4364 D3:2U6 1923 M3. It sounds like whoever told you that the Bike Barn used to be a dairy confused the main Silo building, which could have been built in 1910 (since it shows up on a 1911 map) with the Stock Judging Pavillion, which could have been built in 1916 (since it shows up between 1911 and 1923 on the maps).

20100521 18:11:03 nbsp If you want to use # in a page title, you can use either small number sign (﹟ unicode 0xFE5F) or fullwidth number sign (＃ unicode 0xFF03). You could also use a music sharp symbol (♯ unicode 0x266F) or a viewdata square (⌗ unicode 0x2317), but those technically mean other things. Users/WilliamLewis

20110214 17:10:16 nbsp In my opinion, your name is the second coolest in all of Davis, after Dagon Jones of course. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110215 13:38:00 nbsp I like your name because of its phonetic structure. Your first name sounds gentle, but its also very elusive. Like the many florid, feminine names such as Elizabeth or Alicia, one expects yours will flow on to further syllables. But no! Your name refuses to conform to such boring standards, and it instead abruptly terminates, leaving the listener disoriented and in a mild state of shock. And then, when you least expect it, you are struck by the mightiness of KANE: beginning with the hard slap of the consonant, thus birthing the powerful drag of the long Asound, in turn fading away with the resonant hum of the N.

In conclusion, Im pretty sure that the secrets of the universe are locked up inside your name. Or maybe Im full of it, as people often tell me, and it just has a really nice ring to it.  Users/ScottMeehleib
