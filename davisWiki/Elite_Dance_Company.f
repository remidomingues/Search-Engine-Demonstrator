Elite Dance Company (EDC) is a competitive and performancebased dance team at UC Davis. We incorporate several styles of dance including Ballet/Pointe, Jazz, Contemporary/Lyrical and tap into our routines. We perform at various UC Davis events throughout the year, but spend most of the year preparing for our annual Spring showcase in May in which members put together several pieces of different styles to perform.

Our first annual Spring show (which we hosted with STAND, an antigenocide coalition on campus) was a HUGE success with a great turnout of about 300 people! We were able to put on a spectacular show of nine different EDC performances and have guest performances from various other teams on campus. EDC and STAND also held an afterparty at Agave which turned out to be another success!  We will be hosting a show every May so make sure to come out to support EDC and enjoy a great show!
