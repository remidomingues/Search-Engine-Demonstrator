20100127 14:28:53 nbsp I have worked with Mike for the last 6 months... he is a great trainer and runs a fantastic studio.  He really knows what he is doing and provides fantastic results.  I completely recommend Elite Training. Users/jclay

20110322 11:22:24 nbsp I have trained with Michael for almost 2 years.  He is professional, skilled, and highly motivated.  That motivation has transferred to me and I am stronger than I have ever been and 20 pounds lighter (so far).  I highly recommend him to any aged person who just wants to improve his/her lifestyle! I also like the idea of working out oneonone without the crowds.  So you dont have to worry about how you look when you first start. Users/barbarahammond

20120215 08:03:30 nbsp I started with Michael in June of 2010.  Since that time, I have lost 65 lbs and increased my strength significantly.  Michaels training methodologies keep the workouts interesting.  There is much variety from big ropes, to bag work, to weights to to sand bags, to kettlebells, to a high variety of body weight strength training.  The stretching exercises also keep me injury free.

After my first 9 months with Michael, I started in his Brazilian JiuJitsu training program.  Since then, I have competed in two tournaments and was able to win one.  The group is very supportive of the old guy.  The combination of the personal training and BJJ has truly been life changing.  For an old collegiate athlete, the transformation has felt great!

This is a great place.  You can increase useful strength and learn personal defense skills at the same time in a small family atmosphere.   Users/PaulWhalen

20120215 14:57:19 nbsp I have trained with Michael for over 5 years with the goal of maintaining or improving my coordination, strength, balance and stamina as I grow older.  I am now in my late 70s and feeling well.  Michael has a great knowledge of anatomy and physiology. His program and facilities are outstanding  I recommend him to you. Users/JoeTupin

20120222 15:08:15 nbsp its taken me a long time to finally get around to writing this review but ive been very happy with my training sessions here from the start. when i began with michael i hadnt worked out in years and didnt know what to do with myself in the gym. i only wanted to learn to lift weights but my workouts here were tailored to my individiual goals and evolved as i got stronger. theyve increased not only my strength, but flexibilty, conditioning, confidence, etc. there is constant variety, my hour long sessions go by quickly, and i can count on feeling better than when i started. ive learned a lot and can effectively work out on my own now without fear of injuring myself or logging unnecessary time at the gym. highly recommend!

20120305 00:15:30 nbsp Michael is a fantastic trainer! He is knowledgeable, personable, and very motivating. One hour with him is worth countless hours anywhere else. highly recommended Users/maxmahoney

20120320 11:42:07 nbsp I am a mature woman in my mid sixties who has worked for several years now with Michael as a personal trainer. Both my mother and grandmother had spent their later years seriously impacted by arthritis and therefore problems with mobility. My goal with Michael has been to develop and maintain flexibility, to add strength, improve my cardio function and balance. Working with the support and guidance of Mike I have maintained a regular workout schedule and am consistent in taking better care of myself. Michaels training guidance does not impose a one style fits all, but he pushes me to go for it in terms of using the strength and confidence I have developed. He strengthens my motivation and my own self discipline every day. I recommend him highly to other women in my demographic. Users/CristyJensen
