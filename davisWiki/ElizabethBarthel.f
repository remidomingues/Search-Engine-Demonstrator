20070503 23:57:35 nbsp you put a lot of work into your pet sitting page. it shows. good job. Users/JessicaRockwell

20070812 22:43:42 nbsp Hey, didja take that photo you uploaded to the strings page or get permission to put it up? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070823 17:53:03 nbsp Howdy, Elizabeth... I deleted and reposted the Golden Oldies event because there were some markup errors that were messing up later events.  I tried to keep it as similar as possible, but I did move up the event description to the top of the event.  You might want to read it and make sure it is what you want.  If you want to change it, just copy and repost it and delete my version.  The underlines were causing problems, so you might want to avoid using them. Users/JabberWokky

20081120 18:43:37 nbsp Your pages (with the left/right parallel images bordering a list) break the css, makes me sad because we thought that glitch would never come up :( oh well, one day to be fixed. Users/DavidPoole

20110531 13:16:56 nbsp Hey Elizabeth, that coupon and the mention Davis wiki thing seem pretty promotional.  The wiki, as part of Wiki Spot, is prohibited from promoting businesses or being used as a promotional (rather than informational) tool.  Personally, Im all for having coupons available, but the Wiki probably isnt the proper venue for distributing them.  A better bet would be to note something like they have a coupon coming out in the Little Green Coupon Machine which you can download (link, once its available). Users/TomGarberson

20110601 07:34:01 nbsp (Disclaimer: a good chunk of my business is selling and syndicating coupons to newspapers)  Its a matter of what the IRS considers over the line (see at the very bottom of the page  where is says that were a 501(c)3 nonprofit?).  Nobody is absolutely sure where the line is.  Personally, Id love to see coupons all over the wiki, as I think it would be an added service to the community through the wiki (not that everybody would see it that way, so it would still be a community discussion)... but it would probably conflict with the whole noncommercial mandate we have from the IRS.   Users/JabberWokky

20110606 14:46:59 nbsp As far as I know its not possible... sorry! Users/TomGarberson

20111001 15:41:23 nbsp Hey Elizabeth, Im not sure youll get a response from anybody on the Davis Life Wiki page. The editor had some bad experiences here, and doesnt really check their page (pretty much ever).  You might want to try contacting them directly through their site. Im pretty sure they would be interested in another blogger! Users/Davidlm

20120214 16:23:58 nbsp Elizabeth, I prefer to deal with this on the wiki because several people have asked you in person to control your dogs and stop bringing so many to the dog park at once, and you have not listened. I do not have a dog and have never been a client, but I am asking you, on behalf of many people who are fed up with you, to respect the dog park rules. I have been to the dog park when I lived with dogs last year, and witnessed you breaking the rules firsthand. Of course, I cannot claim to have confronted you then, but have been told several stories by multiple people about their confrontations with you. Just because your clients are happy, or just because you have a business, or just because you think you can handle so many dogs, doesnt make it okay to disrespect the other dog owners at the dog park. Just follow the rules like everybody else. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120220 16:02:28 nbsp or you could just follow the rules and reduce the # of dogs you take to the park at a time. Please dont remove other peoples comments. Users/PeterBoulay

20120220 16:49:03 nbsp Yes I just reviewed the edits. I apologize I was going by your statement on Covertprofessors file: I am removing your comment. Users/PeterBoulay

20120220 18:58:20 nbsp Honestly, I dont know what to say. You keep claiming no one has ever complained to you, and I know several people who have. Im not going to name them because I shouldnt have to its not my fault that you dont remember and not my place to out them online. If youre looking at facts, costs, and time involved? Fact: there are rules. Fact: you have no right to break the rules. Fact: following the rules and taking three dogs at a time still makes you $75/hour. I dont have any other suggestions. If I were you, I would take other peoples concerns seriously instead of brushing them off just because you have a business and a degree in Animal Science. Just try to run your business the best you can while staying within the rules. Pretty simple. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120220 19:20:26 nbsp Elizabeth, I am sorry, I dont know of any place nearby where it is legal to have that many dogs off leash. And I happen to think that there is a good reason for that. Surely you know that even the most wellbehaved dog can be provoked, and that even the best of dog handlers could run into trouble because there is too much for one person to deal with. Even if this is rare, the rule is there because many dogs are not the most wellbehaved and many people are not expert doghandlers  again, as I am sure you know. If you think an exception ought to be made for you and the dogs you watch, perhaps you should lobby with DDOG for some sort of dog handler certification that would permit exceptions to the rule.  Users/CovertProfessor

20130319 08:27:21 nbsp The sentence you just deleted from the page for your pet sitting business is the product of an ongoing discussion Elizabeths Pet Sitting/Ban Proposal here.  You may wish to participate. Users/CovertProfessor

20130319 13:23:28 nbsp I saw you walking with a friend a couple days ago, I recognized you after the fact... Users/StevenDaubert

20130319 20:40:59 nbsp ElizabethIm sorry but other people besides me are complaining about your practices. Its not just me and its not a direct personal attack.  Please consider the following points: 1) You now have 2 documented dogbite concerns about your dog and how you handle clients animals in parks.  2) You are evasive and defensive when asked basic questions and 3) You are stating you are part of a petsitter group where noone can find you listed. Sorry with those concerns, any pet owner considering your service should be aware of those concerns so they can make an informed decision.  I have never posted anywherefor anyone not to use your service....but these are legitimate concerns.

If you want to stop these concerns, then please try to address peoples concerns appropriately instead of giving excuses like Meg mentioned. You can also get yourself listed in the PSI directory properlythat has been requested by at least one other person. Also check out Users/DavidLM Davids comment.

Also note that others are mostly in agreement with the new statement that I worded. This Wiki generally goes by consensus of those on the Wiki.

Any business owner is passioniate about their workI get that and I appreciate it.  I believe there are things you can do to make your business venture appear better on the Wiki. I encourage you to identify and take those steps which will lead to future success.

Thank you for your thoughts. Users/PeteB

20130319 21:50:45 nbsp Elizabethyou post the logo of PSIwe look and cant find you there. PLEASE tell us how we are supposed to react other than concerned??  Why dont you call them and get it fixed so you come up under Davis zipcodes? Thats a concern you can wipe out with one phone callmaybe 2. Thats an easy fix for you to do. Users/PeteB

20130320 11:26:17 nbsp Nice work resolving this step quickly and efficiently. Users/PeteB

20130829 12:45:34 nbsp ElizabethI know nothing about them. Sorry...if I get a chance Ill research them but Im leaving work early and will be gone all day Friday Users/PeteB
