20100826 14:53:08 nbsp Hi ElizabethL, and welcome to the wiki!  I am happy to try to help you however I can.  But can you fill me in a little bit on what is going on?  Which comments do you think were deleted?  And what is going on with these two salons?  What I had noticed was that the new Expressions salon was trying to promote itself on the page for Angies salon, and that isnt right  so I deleted those comments.  Did you see other comments that were deleted?

Also, I was puzzled by the changes you made to the page for Angies Beauty Salon.  Now the salon has two active pages, one under the old page and one under the new.  That is potentially confusing for people trying to figure out what the current salon is and where to leave comments and look for new comments. Users/CovertProfessor

20100829 17:47:56 nbsp I tried a different way of saying that the Angies Beauty Salon was no longer the right name and that people should go to the new page.  Take a look and see what you think. Users/CovertProfessor

20100907 22:21:29 nbsp Hello,
My name is Anamaria and I was one of the owners of Angies Beauty Salon. I just wanted to clear a few things up regarding recent changes and comments made about the salon I currently own (Expressions) and the salon I use to coown (Angies Beauty Salon). I loved Angies Beauty Salon! Angie and I started that salon from scratch and turned it into a successful business! I poured my heart and soul into that business for the last 10 Years!

Angie and I just decided to part ways for personal reasons.

I simply wanted to let the public know that Angie and I legally closed down Angies Beauty Salon. We even featured it in the Davis Enterprise as a closed business and terminated the business license. Angie decided to keep the location and phone number and open a new salon with a new name and new license number, which she named Angie Hair Salon. I, in NO way, have any ill intentions towards Angie Hair Salon.

I, along with some of our clients, wanted to let the public know where to find me and two other hair stylists that worked at Angies Beauty Salon...that was all!

Again...I meant no harm. If our clients or I made it seem that way I am truly sorry!

If anyone wants to know more please feel free to call me and ask any questions.

Thank you so much for your time.  Users/Anavarro
