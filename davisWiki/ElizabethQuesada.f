20120119 08:19:24 nbsp Hello Elizabeth and Welcome to the Wiki.  I noticed you had uploaded some pictures, did you mean to upload them to your business page Hair by Elizabeth Quesada?  If you need help anything dont hesitate to ask as someone would be happy to help.   Users/ChrisDietrich

20120119 09:53:30 nbsp Hello, Elizabeth.  On your (Of course the page belongs to the community wiki.) business page someone using the name Users/ChristopherHitchens made a stink (See Hair By Elizabeth Quesada/Talk.) that your exact words werent preserved there.  Normally that isnt done, as you can see on the other hair stylist pages that references are to they do this or that.  If you feel strongly that you would like to be quoted, my suggestion is to try that within the context of a page that speaks in a they type third person manner  Also you probably want to have a link from your user page here to the business page.

20120206 09:10:51 nbsp Hi Elizabeth!  I just wanted to check  do you own rights to those photos you uploaded?  If not, you might want to switch them out for some of your own.  If you do own the rights, do you intend to release those photos to the Creative Commons, so that anyone can use them (including for their own promotional, forprofit purposes)?  Check out the Copyrights page for more info. Users/TomGarberson

20120208 08:51:23 nbsp Elizabeth, please be careful on changing pages. You made Lucis appear as if it were totally your salon, which my understanding is it is not Users/PeterBoulay

20120208 09:23:25 nbsp If it is, by the way, and has undergone a name change, then the old name is usually kept for historical reasons (because the wiki documents Davis, including our history) and marked as no longer being the same thing (there are even businesses that General Merchandise and Grain predate the wiki by a century).  Is it still called Lucis Salon, or have you replaced the signs and everything? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
