20090404 10:10:26 nbsp I do not recommend Ellas service. My former roommates and myself were in a bindone roommate remained, but several years of roommate dirt was in the house. We all chipped in for Ella, so that the remaining person wouldnt get slammed. Long story short, Ella bailed at the last minute (a day or two before we were supposed to move out) so that we couldnt even get another cleaner in. Our apartment was too dirty. I feel that if shes going to reject clients because of dirtiness level, she should assess the place way ahead of time to allow a suitable replacement to be found. Users/AlexKarner

Ella offered the lowest rate around, spent several hours cleaning my place, and even shared some trade secrets with me for cleaning tough spots. She did a fantastic job and I have already hired her to come back again in two weeks. Users/AmandaKimball
