Elle and her weddings husband used to Yolo County SPCA/Pets of the Month foster cats kittens for the Yolo County SPCA; she highly recommends the experience to others who love animals.



20070306 20:39:29 nbsp Elle is a fabulous person. I highly recommend getting to know her. Users/ElisabethSchmidt

20070319 22:36:40 nbsp Elle is wonderful! I have known her since high school, and if you ever get a chance to be roommates with her (which you wont), its a fun experience. Users/DavidObrien

20070717 20:35:30 nbsp Hi Elle. Theres no way to move pages between wikis at the moment, so I moved your page over by hand. To do this, i typed in {{{http://daviswiki.org/Users/LinaPlanuty}}} to the address bar, and was prompted to create a new page. Alternatively, you could have searched for {{{Users/LinaPlanuty}}} on Davis Wiki. I then pasted in the pages contents using the raw feature on the pages http://wikispot.org/Users/LinaPlanuty?actionraw info section. You can get to the info section by hitting the info button up by the page name. Alternatively, you could see the pages contents by hitting the edit button, copying the contents and then canceling the edit. Tabbed browsing sure makes the whole process easier so you can have quick access to the source and destination pages. Firefox and Safari both do tabbed browsing, as well as the new Internet Explorer. Users/ArlenAbraham

20071206 12:53:05 nbsp Question. I just read your recent comment about the Stonegate Village Apartments. Im interested in looking around for next year.  As a resident when did you start looking last year? Thanks

could you email me at kmpetrich {at} ucdavis dot com?Users/KP

20071215 10:17:49 nbsp Late last night I Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6/Talk questioned that odd Regal Cinema edit.  Do you know anything about the actual event?  I cant find any record of even an arrest in local newspapers, so Im starting to question the whole thing. Users/JabberWokky

20080109 07:17:44 nbsp Im missing where you saw the link on Hanover Drive Apartments.  I http://daviswiki.org/Anderson_Place_Apartments?actiondiff&version238&version137 just added one, but the Address() macro does not automatically link to an entry (and so it would still show up on Orphaned Pages).

Really nice editing yesterday, by the way! Users/JabberWokky

20080109 14:09:10 nbsp Ah, okay... it turns out the Address(Link) is a known bug, and its obscure enough so that it will probably be hanging out for awhile. Users/JabberWokky

20080116 17:02:06 nbsp I use a pseudonym (for now) due to safety reasons.  Not general internet safety, but due to a specific (and unfortunate) situation that I found myself in. Perhaps someday I can change it.  But I thought, using this pseudonym reveals a little about me without using my real namewhile also allowing me to participate in Davis wiki discussions. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080116 19:30:45 nbsp Yep, a two level redirect stop at the first redirect (so does a circular loop).  And you got it with the solution of just pointing things to the real entry. Users/JabberWokky

20080129 23:50:01 nbsp Elle!  Howdy!  I miss our good times at TWM&C.   Users/PopsicleGirl

20080212 16:59:37 nbsp what is wrong with big pictures? at least line them out better it doesnt look good the way you guys put themthanks// Users/DarkSide

20080306 21:20:09 nbsp Hey, Ellen... it might be a good idea to use a year in the name of the comment archiving, especially on the subjects that tend to get lots of reviews.  That way you can do something like Nobu Hiro and have multiple archives over time. Users/JabberWokky

20080307 09:14:03 nbsp Muddling through seems to be a pretty good method; it is how we figured everything else out on the entire wiki to date.  Certainly it is how Ive figured things out.  :)   I only pointed this one out because Ive already hit that particular gotcha with some other archives I did awhile back. Users/JabberWokky

20080317 21:14:31 nbsp Thanks for helping edit the Alpha Kappa Psi page. I really appreciate it (first time posting anything on the daviswiki). Users/DanielOoi

20080321 14:03:03 nbsp Thanks for cleaning up my mistakes. : ) Users/MamaLoebs

20080414 14:59:34 nbsp The edits were made from a restricted access journalism lab at Berkeley. I asked an Aggie staffer which Aggie alumni were at Cal for journalism at the time. The only person they were aware of was Talia. Nothing can be proven with absolute certainty, but absent a subpoena (which it is too late for) or a confession on Talias part (aint happening), this is about as certain as we can get. Users/WilliamLewis

20080415 12:03:36 nbsp Nope.  If you think you are correct or you have no intent of harm, you are safe.  William thinks he is correct.  (To put it another way, you can only get in trouble if you know you are lying and you intend harm).  No legal reason for it in this case. Users/JabberWokky

20080421 14:03:35 nbsp Sorry Ive been scarce! Ive just been very busy lately. Maybe in the summer Ill have more time to contribute. Im still out here lurking, though. And thanks for the comment, its nice to be missed. Users/CovertProfessor

20080602 14:26:25 nbsp Ha!  I was about to do the Fall redirect, and I even previewed a version with a link. Users/JabberWokky

20080608 20:35:23 nbsp Its DauBERT, the French root however is prounced doughbear.

20080618 15:55:23 nbsp Elle, thank you for your help! Users/wendyn

20080624 11:39:02 nbsp Nice catch on the spam.  With all the back and forth on the reviews as a whole, I missed that single one. Users/JabberWokky

20080629 17:03:34 nbsp Hi Elle. Just noticed you reverted my edits. I thought Ags could separate personal profiles from business profiles. Could you help me with this ? Users/DavidScott

20080629 18:07:44 nbsp Thanks for the heads up. I wanted to incorporate those in the business page since my sister has never had a business in Davis. Also I couldnt find how to link my old wikispot profile to wikidavis? Thanks.   Users/DavidScott

20080715 17:10:18 nbsp Do you work for OneGate? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080724 19:11:58 nbsp Hi Elle!  Its Emma. How exciting that I got a message from you!  My comment wasnt very clear, but what I meant was: based on what we know, Stonegate gives back a LOT of your security deposit.  When Joel moved out of his last apt here, the place was in good shape but there were some noticeable cat scratches and bite marks. He got his deposit back in full, as did two other sets of neighbors we talked to.  That said, it may have something to do with whether or not the apartment is scheduled for a remodeling  maybe they dont care if they know theyre going to redo the whole thing anyway.  And maybe things are different now that Shearen isnt manager.  Hope that helps clarify.  We still need to get together sometime  can we come visit your kittens?  We have one fussy kitty who wont tolerate other cats, so were kittendeprived. :)  Take care! Users/DavisKid84

20080825 11:41:53 nbsp Nope.  I invented the term as far as I know (and I dont really watch Family Guy).  I dont doubt that it exists somewhere.  It was an absurd replacement so I didnt have to use an actual offensive term repeatedly. Users/JabberWokky

20080915 16:33:16 nbsp I like your links on the Trees page. Nice. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080919 13:35:39 nbsp Thank you for fixing my link! I too love cats! Users/DaveCar

20080922 09:36:29 nbsp thanks for replacing the davistext links on bookstores, I would have done it myself  but I had asked joe... I tend not to revert... Users/StevenDaubert

20081003 12:26:08 nbsp If you look at the source of several of those entries, youll see that the photo is not actually on the wiki  it is an outside reference to another website.  Thats why the photo request is there.  The photo is of dubious origin, may just disappear someday (as its not hosted here) and cannot be reused according to Copyrights Creative Commons like the rest of the photos on the wiki.  (Nor can they be aligned, thumbnailed or captioned, which is why the entries are single sentences in a big table).  When Users/RichLindvall created those entries, he just linked to the photos directly off their website.  Id say the Photo Request should probably stay on those entries.
Users/JabberWokky
 I was wondering about those requests yesterday and that is the conclusion that I came to as well ^__^  Users/StevenDaubert

20081014 16:51:22 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/Alekhine?actiondiff&version22&version11 clap, clap, clap. Users/JabberWokky

20081025 17:56:31 nbsp Thank you Elle! Users/Rachelottlinger

20081209 12:18:58 nbsp Hey, UC Daviss In Memorandum entry for him lists the other birth year.  Sometimes those early records can be iffy, so it might make sense to list both.  Where did you get your info? Users/JabberWokky

20081209 13:03:39 nbsp Knowles A. Ryerson Hows that? Users/JabberWokky

20081227 17:33:36 nbsp Hi Elle.  Users/RyanBasilio made wiki:lawiki, but I noticed that you made wiki:la.  Maybe you two could get together and help start out the wiki.  LA is a big place though, good luck.  (Me, Im happily chugging along on wiki:ventura). Users/BrentLaabs

20090210 15:15:03 nbsp No problem.  I ran into this problem before on the Chico Wiki  I also had a time of it then.  Its a bit odd how double underscores turn into a single space in the displayed page title. Cheers! Users/RyanMikulovsky


20090310 13:36:17 nbsp I was wondering if there was another dog trainer in town to warrant a topical entry for dog training.  Isnt there a local kennel that does training as well? Users/JabberWokky

20090319 22:11:52 nbsp Thanks very much for making the Affordable Housing page, its an important part of understanding the Davis political process. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090402 19:28:19 nbsp Thanks Elle! Users/NathanielVigeant

20090603 14:57:15 nbsp what changes have you made?

 Users/HarryvKendall

20090616 12:17:57 nbsp Thank you for your feedback. But I disagree, and there is no absolute policy about such changes. I was helping the owners. Please dont rerevert my reversion, as I think this is a needless conflict.  Users/DonShor

20090706 15:00:09 nbsp Why must you fight the War on Christmas? Users/BrentLaabs

20090706 16:40:48 nbsp Pay no attention to Brent.  Hes just upset because every year he tries to grow out a big full white beard so he can jingle bells and every year the only hair that grows long and bushy is his ear hair.  Poor guy.  Even the reindeer keep their ear fur trim. Users/JabberWokky

20090728 13:06:02 nbsp Having Anonymous as an attribution is a really bad idea. It gives a false sense of protection, and opens up a bad precident. Users/JasonAller

20090728 14:10:41 nbsp Unlinked Initials? Its been done before.  Users/EdWins

20090728 14:24:27 nbsp Yes, the unlinked initials are pretty common, also when theres a tight conversation between several people and theres no need for big signatures. Users/JabberWokky

20090729 01:43:44 nbsp Thanks for working on that signature removal issue today. I dont know what a good way to handle that would be. In general Ive restored the signature and explained to the person that removing it doesnt hide anything and that they can choose to remove the entire comment if they wish. There is no set way for dealing with it though. Users/JasonAller
