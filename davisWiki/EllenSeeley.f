Ellen is finally finished with her undergrad, as of September 2005. Thats only like, what, 8 years spent trying to finish her B.A.? (Whos counting?) She now lives and works in East Davis, while formulating her plans for grad school and cosmic reunification.

Ellen is one of those eccentrics who LOVES Davis and wants to remain there long after college.



She would LOVE to find a nice, quiet person to share her 2BR in the fall. With, perhaps, a kitty. Anyone, anyone?????

She also feels like an idiot writing in the third person.)

  I would not worry so much about the timing of your bachelors degree. I myself graduated high school in 1998, and am just now doing my own grad ceremony. Also, do you have a sister named Morgan?  Paul Amnuaypayoat
