The Elmendorf Beast was a beast in Texas that couldnt be positively identified after being fatally shot in Texas.  It was a blue, hairless creature that closely resembled a chupacabra.  Or it may have been a werewolf that was killed during metamorphosis.  Although the truth may never be known, some DNA tests have suggested that it was either a coyote or dog with mange. A DNA sample was sent to the  UC Davis VMTH that ended up being inconclusive. Other DNA samples were sent to laboratories in Quebec, New York City and, of course, Texas.

Some more information can be found on the wiki:wikipedia:Elmendorf Beast Wikipedia article, but the linked media has gone the way of the farofour bird.  Even the http://www.texasbluedog.org/ official site is down, which may indicate the beasts relatives are now hunting down and slaying websites documenting their fallen cerulean brethren.

Some say that the paranormal activity beasts ghost runs through the Morris Fountain when the moon is full.
