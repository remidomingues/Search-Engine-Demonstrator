20110801 18:13:24 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  If you havent seen it yet, its worth looking over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner welcome  theres a lot of useful information there.  I removed the Google Maps link from the S&S Computer Repair page, not because its not useful, but because theres actually an address macro built into the Wiki Software.  By putting the address into a format like this: {{{Address(1234 La Rue Boulevard Street Ave.)}}} you actually add a little Map button up next to the Edit, Info, and Talk buttons next to the page name.  Another editor already did so for S&S.  Anyway, welcome to the Wiki, and thanks for working on the S&S page.  If you have any questions, dont hesitate to ask.

Also, its nice having another business out in the West Davis neck of the woods.  Good luck! Users/TomGarberson
