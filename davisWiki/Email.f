Email, or electronic mail, is a service that allows Internet users (both the human and robotic kind) to exchange messages to one another.  Email message can be anything from a simple note reminding a university student of an upcoming frat party, or an advertisement promoting cheap Cialis (advertisements through email is called SPAM).

To benefit from the exchange of email, a person must have an email address.  This is usually a username, followed by the @ symbol (pronounced at), then the domain name where the email address is being hosted.  Once someone has an email address, they must have an email account.  Generally, when a person gets an email address, they get an email account as well.  This account provides an Inbox for email messages to be stored as well as an Outbox for a users pending emails to be sent.

UC Davis students are offered the option to have a UC Davis email account.  Some opt out, creating an email account at many free email services.  Email offers an affordable solution for university students to keep in touch with relatives in other states and countries.  Email also provides a way for people in different countries to connect with each other.

 Google Mail.  Google Mail, or Gmail, prides itself on allowing users inbox space in the gigabytes.  It runs a counter on the Gmail homepage, proving that its always adding Inbox space for Gmail users.  Gmail is currently open to people who receive an invite from either a current Gmail user, or by a person entering their mobile phone number at Gmails signup page.  Gmail runs on the idea that a Gmail user will never have to delete a piece of mail again.  Gmail is one of the few email providors around to offer free POP and SMTP, though this is often a slow service due to the fact that its over a secure connection.  Controvery arose when Gmail announced it would run unobtrusive advertisements based on the content of mail messages.  Gmail assures users it does not invade privacy by reading messages.  Gmail has customizable quips and sometimes useful links above each folder  for example, the SPAM folder offers (food) recipies that include SPAM. Recently, Gmail offered a RSS ticker to senior Gmail users.  http://gmail.google.com Google Mail
 Yahoo! Mail.  Yahoo! Mail has been around for nearly a decade.  Yahoo! Mail was one of the first widescale free email providors.  Yahoo! Mail was one of the first to create a solution to annoying SPAM messages by offering a Bulk Mail folder.  Users of SBC Internet Services or Prodigy Internet are provided with a free premium Yahoo! Mail account.  Yahoo! Mail also has services for small businesses.  Yahoo! Mail used to offer free POP access until it became too much for the company to handle.  Yahoo! Mail gives users the ability to colorcustomize its email pages.  Users with a Yahoo! Mail ID can also enjoy benefits from the rest of the Yahoo! network, including games, classifieds, Yahoo! 360 (similar to MySpace and Yahoo! Geocities.  Yahoo! Mail, in competition with Gmail, now offers every free user 1GB of Inbox space.  Yahoo! Mail generates revenue from flash and signatureline advertisements.  http://mail.yahoo.com Yahoo! Mail
 Hotmail.  Started in the mid1990s and purchased by MSN in the late 1990s, Hotmail is the runnerup in free email services competing with Gmail.  Most Internet users seeking to use email for the first time prefer the ease of use of Hotmail, although more experienced internetters usually find the interface cluttered, adladen, and slow.  Users running Microsofts Windows XP operating system will find their Hotmail address serves as their .net Passport which allows them to use certain Microsoft features.  Hotmail users gain access to MSN Messenger, a popular messaging program (especially among International users, who do not find the A in AOL Messenger appealing).  Hotmail currently offers 250MB of Inbox space.  http://hotmail.com Hotmail
 Mail.com.  Mail.com offers something unique about the way people email.  Unlike Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail, users of Mail.com are given the choice of many different domain names to fit their personality.  Mail.com offers 100MB of Inbox space.  Mail.com is frequently down due to system upgrades.  http://mail.com Mail.com
 Mailinator.com  Instant junk mailbox  Websites with compulsory registration often require that you enter a vaild email address. However, the more often you give out your email address, the more spam youre going to get. Enter mailinator, a free service that offers temporary, public email accounts. Simply enter anythingyouwant@mailinator.com as your email address, then go to mailinator.com and check your temporary mailbox. http://mailinator.com Mailinator.com
 dodgeit.com  Offers the same service as Mailinator above, the website is a little lighter weight and you can get an RSS feed of your mailbox. http://dodgeit.com/ DodgeIt.com
Premium email

All of the above free email providors (except Gmail) allow their users, and often push them, to purchase upgrades to their email accounts.  Some email providors only offer premium email.

 GoDaddy.  GoDaddy was made famous for a line of risque commercials that aired during the 2004 Super Bowl.  GoDaddy is mostly known for its domain registration and hosting plans, but with the purchase of a domain name, a person receives a free premium email account.  The catch is the purchase of a domain name, which can be quite literally anything that isnt already taken.  Most people choose their name or business (if their business isnt something like Macys or CNN).  http://godaddy.com GoDaddy
