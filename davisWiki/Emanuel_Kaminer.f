Manny sings in the anonymous crowd.

At his wedding they will play The Press Gang when they walk down the aisle.

His favorite singer is Eddie Murphey.

Hes Jewish and tries to stay Kosher, although I made him eat the Pastor from Taqueria Guadalajara Guadalajara, cuz frankly, its worth going to hell for (or wherever evil jews go).

He likes to watch Legend with Tom Cruise on mute with Children of Bodom playing in the background while he smokes from a bong made out of a dragon horn.

Pretty decent guy if you ask me.
