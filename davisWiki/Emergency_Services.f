Davis is a good town. Some call it a bubble. But bad things can happen.
 Calling 911 
  Calling from a land line is preferable to calling from a cell phone, since the emergency responder can more easily assess your location
  Contact Davis 911 directly from a cell phone by calling 5307563400 or 5307583600
  Calling 911 from a cell phone on the UC Davis campus will connect you directly to the UC Davis Police Department.
  You can also call 911 from a VOIP (internet) phone if the system administrator has it setup properly. For more technical information visit http://www.whichvoip.com/e911.htm or for consumer information read the FCC guide http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/voip911.pdf.

 When to call 911 
911 should be reserved for the most dire of medical emergencies, but when in doubt, call anyway.

 Shelter info 
Anybody know where local shelters are (in case of a disaster that destroys or makes many homes temporarily unavailable)?  Specifically, it might be a good idea to note if the emergency shelter plan will allow animals.  That way pet owners can make backup plans if the local shelters are not going to be allowing nonservice animals (or also note local groups that have advanced plans to offer emergency shelter).
  According to http://www.city.davis.ca.us/emergency/, there was a shelter set up at Third and B the Teen Center at Third and B. This information has since been removed, and I do not know if that is the usual or only location, or the status of animals.
   My understanding of RedCross shelters is that they will set up animal shelters when they set up multiple shelters in extreme emergencies.  But, they can not allow animals into every shelter and theyre only allowed into specifically designated ones (primarily to deal with aleregy issues that some people experience). (someone with more knowledge may speak up hopefully)  Users/WesHardaker
   According to Mondays Enterprise, people would usually have been instructed to seek shelter at the Veterans Memorial Center or the Davis Senior Center.  Unfortunately both places lost electricity, so a shelter was opened at Third and B.  I dont know about animal policies.   Users/CovertProfessor
