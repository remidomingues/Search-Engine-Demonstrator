Emerson Hall is a fine dorm situated just Northwest of campus. It is part of the Cuarto area. Living situation is suitestyle, with 46 people to a suite. Sometimes crazy things end up in the pool, like shopping carts, road signs, fish, or bicycles. Freshmen have way too much time on their hands.

Emerson is home to several Academic Theme Programs theme programs, including the Science Academic Theme Program,  the Health Science Academic Theme Program, the Leadership program, and EOP program.

Emerson has been known for its false fire alarms. Firefighters have been known to pull sleepy freshman out of bed.

The closest DC is the Oxford Circle Dining Commons, which has since been remodeled is open as of Fall 2010. The convenience store formerly in Emerson Hall has since been moved there.




Advantages
  Suitestyle dormitory buildings provide a common area (lounge) in each suite
  Right next to the University Mall, home of The Old Teahouse, Subway, Game Stop, World Market, Trader Joes, etc.
  Next to Oxford Circle Park (home of the big kid playground & frisbee golf!).
  The B and C bus lines stop right outside of Cuarto!
  Offers more privacy than traditional dorms such as Segundo and Tercero do.
  Emerson has pools and hot tubs. And all of Tercero and Segundo are jealous of the hot tubs.
  You share a bathroom with two to three other people.
  The dining commons was recently renovated, and so offers the most uptodate dining experience out of the three areas.

Disadvantages
  You are responsible for maintaining your own bathroom, although custodial staff do come in every other week to clean.
  Suitestyle dormitory does not offer the same opendoor policy traditional dorms foster. This may make socializing more difficult for some people, as people tend to bond more with their suitemates.  But really, keep your door open and walk around and invite yourself over to other suites, people love the company and voila you have new friends.
  Smaller dining commons (compared to Segundo or Tercero), but the balcony area and upstairs seating area  may make up for the smaller size.
  Offcampus. (Approximately a two to three minute bike ride to campus, and approximately a five to ten minute bike ride to classrooms.)

Poolside Cuarto



Suites



Laundry

There are two laundry rooms on the ground level. One in the very corner of poolside and the other on grass side is located on what is known as the lego, because protrudes out of the main structure into the courtyard and is red. You can just claim a locker to put your detergent by putting a lock on it.

20090831 22:49:45 nbsp I heard that one room in each of the cuarto suites has its own bathroom. Is this true? If yes, In the Emerson suites is it room A, B, or C that has its own bathroom attached? Users/allison2013

20090901 06:36:38 nbsp its the B room. i was in 322B when i was a freshmen :D Users/StevenLee

20120205 11:05:15 nbsp This dorm is fucking horrible. I lived here last year and didnt believe the rumors of it being less social, but it was terrible. Things might be different in different years, but for us youd never find an open door, people wouldnt even open their blinds, people wouldnt watch things in the TV common room, and people would only really do things with their suitemates. We went through the entire year without even meeting our neighbors because we never saw them.

I think its pretty bullshit that a dorm, something with the sole purpose of meeting people and acclimating you to college, can even have rumors of being antisocial, let alone having it be true, especially with the completely debilitating cost of it. They should either eliminate the cuarto dorms altogether or give people living in them a huge discount over the normal dorms because of how horrible they are Users/LRonHubbard
