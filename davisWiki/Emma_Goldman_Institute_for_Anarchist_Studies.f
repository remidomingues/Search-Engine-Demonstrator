The Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies is an art project started by UC Davis Masters of Fine Arts student Users/SteveLambert Steve Lambert. The piece of art that bears the title wiki:wikipedia:Emma_Goldman Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies is a sign mimicking the design of the university construction signs.  It is ten feet by seven feet and made of wood, inkjet, and vinyl. It was on display at the Pence Gallery in June of 2005.  The sign was also http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucdavis/2215306.html spotted on the Art Buildings lawn on May 27th, 2005, where it sat next to some University Construction ongoing construction. It was most recently seen on the grass by Environmental Horticulture on September 27th, 2005. A good crowd of people were stopping to read it  and presumably trying to decide if it is real or not. It is a real sign, no doubt.

While the web address (ucdavis.egias.org) on the sign looks like a http://www.ucdavis.edu ucdavis.edu web page, and might once have routed to a website that continued the facade, it seems that ownership of the egias.org domain has lapsed, and has been taken over by a softcore porn vendor.
Or perhaps this is just another stage of the ironic commentary of this satire?

20051017 08:37:10 nbsp I love this sign! Users/JackHaskel

20051108 02:09:58 nbsp I was bikeriding to the Mondavi Center and when I saw this sign, I freaked out. First, I was really curious about why UC Davis would dedicate a whole institute to the study of anarchy, and second, this is a government funded institute so anarchy studies seem terribly ironic. Also, myself and a friend of mine were talking about Emma Goldman, so the sign definitely caught my attention. And when I heard from a friend that the sign was fake, that it was set up by an art student, I thought, Kudos to him! Thats a damn awesome sign. It sure as hell fooled me!!! Users/ArielaHaro

20051108 08:36:32 nbsp Got me! I, too thought this was for real and thought Oh those wacky academics. Users/PaulThober

20051108 19:40:48 nbsp When I saw it I thought Damn good idea! (though the cost seemed high by 100x). Historically there was a major Jewish Anarchist movement, they had their own schools even. I saw a documentary on it. It is more appropriate than you might think... Users/SteveDavison

20051119 15:59:16 nbsp Hilarious.  Im pleasantly surprised that The Man hasnt taken action against the posting of this sign  maybe free speech is making a comeback. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060119 19:09:28 nbsp Dammit...We need a real anarchist institute. Users/TobinJones

20060124 23:47:15 nbsp By all means, feel free to make your own Anarchist Institute at UC Davis.  You certainly dont need a multimillion dollar building or offficial approval to get something started.  Do it yourself!  Step one, team up with the Anarchist Reading Group.  Users/SteveLambert

20060124 23:57:35 nbsp Yeah, isnt a statefunded and approved Anarchist Institute a bit of a contradiction? :) Users/RoyWright
  I think that was the jokeUsers/TobinJones

20070301 21:17:41 nbsp Actually, San Francisco City College houses the lagest Anarchist Library around, from what I remember. Users/KennethSime

20070722 20:49:13 nbsp Kenneth, UC Davis has an Anarchist Papers Special Collection in the library.  UC Berkeley is home of the Emma Goldman Papers Project.  Not sure about SF State... Users/slambert
