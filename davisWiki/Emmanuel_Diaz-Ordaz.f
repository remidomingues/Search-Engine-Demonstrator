A weeklong event dedicated to the issues around AB540, and undocumented students ending with a scholarship giveaway open to all students.

TACO TRUCK ON CAMPUS

GENERATION SEX WEEK PROGRAMING
Gender Soliloqueers
The second annual Gender Soliloqueers invites students of all genders and sexualities to express themselves through performances, spoken word, and radial monologues.
Foreskin Awareness Day
A day dedicated to foreskin awareness specifically it’s effects on men physically, mentally, emotionally, and creatively.
Rape Culture In Greek Life
A program advocating for victims of violence and rape, specifically within Greek communities.

INCREASE LEADERSHIP RETREAT/CONFERENCE ALLOCATION
As of now, some money is being allocated to certain leadership retreats on campus. However, it is not nearly enough. There needs to be more institutionalized money for these very crucial community building, ally developing retreats and conferences in order for us to learn from each other and other UC’s to make our own campus a safer space for all communities.


Short and Simple, mostly.
