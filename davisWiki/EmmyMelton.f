20120114 16:27:07 nbsp Hi, did you ever end up getting a ticket for running the light on Russel? Users/JLee05

20120114 17:11:39 nbsp No, I didnt. I waited a few months and nothing showed up in the mail. I was paranoid that maybe it got lost in the mail so I went into the police station just to make sure. The lady told me I probably got lucky and told me to never run a red light again. Of course I dont plan on running red lights on purpose! Users/EmmyMelton
