 Popular Local Employment 
Of course, you can also go around town and throw your resume at anyone with a Help Wanted sign in their window (though we would actually recommend handing your resume to the person in charge in a polite and professional manner, as throwing it may not be conducive to obtaining a job, and could conceivably even result in assault charges). If youd really like to work someplace in particular, but they dont have openings listed, give them your resume anyways. Many local businesses hire asneeded based on resumes they receive unsolicited.

You can learn how to apply for different jobs at the job applications page.
