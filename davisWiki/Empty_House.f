The empty house had nothing but a stereo in it, hence it was named Empty House.  Eventually it had couches and a kitchen table. It was also known as the house with the pool table. The garage was almost a complete music studio as well as a place to crash after parties. GnarToon liked to party at Empty House!

  Canseco played one of their first shows in the living room.

  PBUHKGHGH would rock blackstonergoredoomthrashpowerdeath metal daily in the garage.

Empty House was also home to Keith the Dog.  He shared a room with Mike.

An inside view of Empty House:


Users/BudCutino and Users/DanMasiel used to live here until they were banished in what has come to be known as the Great Cultural Revolution of 04. Screams of the innocent victims of that dark summer can still be heard in the long dark hallways of Mt. Haus.

jesus freaking christ! will someone finally create a page about me already?! ive been mentioned in, i dont know, like three pages and pictured on both the Empty House and Keith the Dog pages. this is ridiculous. evan Users/EvanHart has his own page and ive totally got more davis street cred than that guy! jeesh!  i mean, i guess i could do it myself but that strikes me as a little narcissistic.
  Users/BudCutino as you wish, Bud
