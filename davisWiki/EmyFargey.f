Emy is an undergraduate student in Viticulture and Enology.  She can often be sighted from afar by means of her brightlycolored aura.  She currently lives at J Street Coop, where the residents love her (and her mad chef skills) very much.

Emy is from wiki:WikiPedia:Santa_Barbara%2C_California Santa Barbara, where she previously attended wiki:WikiPedia:Santa_Barbara_City_College.  Emy knows a lot about bugs and beer and has a secret weakness for heirloom tomatoes.  She does not in fact dye her aura, but she is simply full of so much cheer and enthusiasm that it spills out of her skin and turns her all the colors of the rainbow.

Emy is one of the most awesome people that Users/ArianaBrill has ever met.
