As of May 2010 Dr. Halle has retired and left his practice in the hands of Dr. Penn.

Dr. Halle only does Endodontics (root canals and the like). He is a friendly man in his later years that likes to ask if everything is alright. Some people say he resembles the actor http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000513/ William H. Macy.

Enborg Halle, DDS and Steven E. Penn, DDS share an office.

20060620 09:58:31 nbsp Dr. Halle & his staff were great.  I had a root canal done recently at his office and he was very patient, understanding and friendly.  I felt no pain while he was performing the root canal.  I would deffinately reccomend him to someone who needs a specialist (endodontist). JenMichaelis

20070119 14:17:30 nbsp I also had a good experience at this endodontist.  I actually saw his partner whose name is Penn I think. Although no root canal is good, he was professional, and seemed to listen to my concerns.  Some doctors get annoyed with lots of questions which can be a sign of insecurity about ones proficiency.  Dr Penn answered all my questions, and made me feel at ease about the procedure. MichaelNicholas

20080530 15:16:06 nbsp Highly recommend.  Ive had lots of dental work by different practitioners and he is the most gentle and kind dentist Ive been to.  I just had a second root canal and I had no pain except that initial injection which he warns you about and apologizes for.  He frequently checked me to see how I was doing.  I almost went to sleep.  The other staff there are super too  kind and professional. Users/lmusser
