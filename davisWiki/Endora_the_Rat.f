Endora used to be called Enduro when she belonged to someone else, but her new owners didnt have an extreme interest in rock climbing, so they renamed her. She lives with the Z twins: Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon and Users/AmyZimmerman Amy. And Users/ScottBiggart Davis Coeds Scotty too. Seeing as Endora was adopted from Sharons old roommate Vineta she belongs to Sharon.

After Endoras sister Delores passed away in November of 2004 and after Po passed away in March of 2005 Sharon and Amy decided that they would share Endora. Endora got a new roommate named Petunia the Rat Petunia in April.

Sadly, Endora passed away on October 30, 2005.
