I am currently very ill and have turned over my business to a dear friend to continue while I am recovering.  She is a skilled therapist and Reiki Practitioner.  I have lowered the prices to keep you happy in my absence and to relieve those in need during these unstable economic times....the prices are as follows...
1 HOUR MASSAGE...$30   1.5 Hour Massage...45$      Bless you in these times and always.
