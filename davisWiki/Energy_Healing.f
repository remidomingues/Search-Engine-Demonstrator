Energy Healing is, generally, a form of healing emphasizing concentration and intent.  The term encompasses a wide range of forms, and the greater topic of wiki:wikipedia:Energy medicine is a major facet of complementary and alternative medicine as defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

Energy Healing practitioners have appeared at booths at the Whole Earth Festival, and local Davis residents practice energy healing.

20080724 14:10:42   Surprisingly, there are quite a few studies exploring socalled therapeutic touch (TT) practices that came up from my search in Web of Science. No findings from reputable journals demonstrate any evidence of healing beyond the placebo effect level. One article tested practitioners claim to sense the energy field of others and found that their ability is only randomly successful: Their failure to substantiate TTs most fundamental claim is unrefuted evidence that the claims of TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified (Rosa L et al., Journal of the American Medical Association, 279:13). I would guess that there is a natural, therapeutic advantage found in intimate touching—part of our limbic regulation is tied to feeling connected with others—although I would hope everyday relationships and friendships would suffice. If for some intimacy cannot be found interpersonally, then perhaps paying for it is a rational shortterm solution. However from my vantage, Quantum Touch seems like another scheme designed to capitalize on peoples medical problems. Why not take a restorative yoga course, instead? That way you’ll get some exercise and a sense of connectedness without having to opt into any faith healing paradigms. —Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20080724 19:23:03 nbsp An interesting thing is that yoga also emphasizes energy based practices, such as chakras.  I agree that the exercise is good for you, but if you ignore an aspect of its history, practice and belief, arent you just bastardizing it for modern society? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080724 21:27:59 nbsp Speaking of reputable journals, do you know the average publishing fee for said journals? Thousands. Users/Sankofa416
  Ive never heard of this being a serious obstacle to publication. Could you perhaps cite some kind of source? Users/JoePomidor
