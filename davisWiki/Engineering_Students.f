Stereotypically geeky, engineering students dedicate themselves in their 4+ years at UCD taking classes that (for the most part) have been planned out for them for their whole undergraduate career.  There is little room for exploration into other majors as engineering majors are generally 180 units (compared to 90 units for most Letters and Science L&S majors, with some loser majors weighing in at 60 units), the first chunk of which are math (21A, B, C, D) and science (CHE 2A, B, C and PHY 9A, B, C, D) classes.  There is a good amount of competition as well as camaraderie in the classes and labs, as many students practically live in Kemper Hall.  Many do not survive the Weeder Classes weeder classes and switch to other majors.  Of those that do, many expect to make lots of money to make up for the lost time and social life.

Engineersand, by extensionengineering studentsactually communicate quite well, but only with other engineers.  Many people do not expect engineering students to be able to communicate effectively to nonengineers.  Because of this, engineering students are forced to take a communications class.  After taking the Communications 3, some engineering students are convinced that the communication Communications Department is a load of crap and teaches people that they dont need logic or truth, only that they need to keep people happy with tact and bullshit.  Communication students and engineering students may very well be natural enemies: the engineering student disdains the communications curriculum as lacking in intellectual rigor and/or usefulness  (while secretly envying the comm students freedom to take the Classic UC Davis Courses tractor driving class), while the comm student sneers at the engineering students perceived intellectual snobbishness and/or ivory tower elitism (while secretly envying the respect accorded to students in perceived smart majors).

As an aside, California Aggie columnist Anna Ritner wrote a http://web.archive.org/web/20070305222116/http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/04/18/Opinion/I.3Enginerds1859315.shtml?norewrite200606130309&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com column about enginerds during the 20052006 school year. The column champions enginerds as awesome, but readers are entitled to their own opinions about whether this generalization is, in all seriousness, fair.

 Women 
There are more of them than you think.  They tend not to draw attention to themselves.  Geeky women like having their intelligence appreciated but loathe reactions like ZOMFG UR A GIRL!!!  IN ENGINEERING!!!!!!! DATE ME PLZ?!?  Also, if you are in a class group with only one woman, dont expect her to be the secretary.



I never took a lower division communications class (I transferred to UCD and must have satisfied it some other way).  But I did end up taking a couple communications classes to fulfill my upper division GE requirements.  I found them to be some of the easiest classes Id taken at UCD.  Stay awake in class OR read the text and get an easy A.  I did find the lack of rigorous logic interesting.  There was no right or wrong... just a bunch of experiments and opinions.
