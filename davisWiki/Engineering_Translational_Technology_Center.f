The Engineering Translational Technology Center is a technology incubator headquartered in Academic Surge. It is designed to help clients (mainly professors) develop products with the aim of bringing them to market. It is focused on the intellectual property (IP) side of business (business plan, IP licensing, financing, etc.) vs. prototype construction. The clients benefit by increased value for their research (i.e. a company), and UC Davis benefits from the licensing of the IP which they hold. The subtler function is that the University also benefits by being able to claim all aspects of startup creation so that IP creators are less able to claim value for work done on the outside.
