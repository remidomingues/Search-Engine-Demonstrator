A car rental place. Requires car insurance which you can buy through them. Accepts debit cards but will put a hold on your card until the car is returned. Before returning, you must refuel the vehicle to the same fuel level you received when you picked up the vehicle. Footnote(https://enterprise.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3106/kw/gas)


20060620 20:31:44 nbsp I made a reservation for June 17 so I could drive to my boyfriends graduation party in the Bay Area, but the driver was over an hour late picking me up. When I called a second time for an ETA, the office had closed. After I called a friend to pick me up, I tried the office once more, just for the hell of it. The receptionist answered, and said the driver was on his way, but I told her not to bother. I ended up getting several perks, including a free upgrade, no penalty on leaving the tank empty, and a $25 discount for next time. They seemed really eager to keep my business, which they would have had anyway if I were in the market for renting a car again sometime soon, since its the only company I know that will rent to people (UCD students) under 25.

20070802 18:11:24 nbsp I rented a car from them so I could drive to a job interview. It cost me $10 extra bucks because I wasnt 25, but it was still cheaper and more convenient than taking the train. Go figure. I didnt bother with the pickup service. Users/ArlenAbraham

20080310 20:19:26 nbsp This place doesnt fill the tank w/ gas before renting the car.   To me, this is a deceptive ploy whereby customers end up overfilling the tanks on the return.  There really is no excuse for not filling the gas tank before renting the car in the first place.   I wont use this place again.   Users/davemills

20080415 13:33:14 nbsp I wont ever come back here again. Be very careful when they do a bogus inspection and pin things on you b/c they are bitter you didnt buy their car insurance. They also try to charge more if youre under 25 and you have to especially ask for the student rate.  Users/beluga

20080622 17:55:54 nbsp beluga, name a rental car place that does not charge a fee for underage drivers.  Also, why wouldnt you have to ask for the student rate?  If they used it for everyone, they would lose tons of money!  It is a deal for UC Davis students and I dont you having to ask for the discount is an inconvenience to you.  I have had nothing but good experiences at this location. Users/stevefranks

20080821 19:30:00 nbsp I had a good experience here very friendly staff, nice car, no problems at all.  Users/GSB

20080925 08:52:27 nbsp I rent from here a lot cause I live in the bay and I the staff is always very professional and fast. Ive never had a problem and theyve always taken care of me, they even give me free bottles of water!  And Beluga and Dave....for underage driving (Im under 25 and go to UCD) they charge a fee $10 less than Budget and Avis. Thats why I stopped going to those guys. And with the Davis plan they have set up, they  they dont even charge the underage fee.  Why are you so arrogant to think they would know youre a student, Beluga?  Im sure more people try to scam them on gas because they are the ones who are already spending money and dont want to pay more. And the insurance, really?  Make sure you look over the car you take out cause you sign, its not their fault if you dont do your part. They walk you to the car for a reason.  Im a loyal customer, these guys are great, and I will always rent from them.  Users/wordscannotexpress23

20081120 17:11:46 nbsp Dont use their pick up service.  Youre better off walking to their office.  Other than that, they have excellent service. Users/hokusman

20090320 15:32:06 nbsp I enjoyed my experience with Enterprise.  Before I discovered enterprise I went to Budget Rent a Car and didnt get the good customer service as I did with Enterprise. I liked that Enterprise offer student rates and pick up and drop off services.  I dont think Budget does that.  Staff were friendly and I think Ill be coming back when I need to rent a car again. Users/kikao

20090415 02:18:25 nbsp I have been wanting to find a good car rental company, and I feel that Enterprise seems like a good bet. I am a UCD student, and I am wondering how much is the student discount, is it related to the under 21 fee? or to the actual rental?  Users/JeffKwong

20091219 11:39:43 nbsp Ive made countless car rentals from here and theyve been FANTASTIC every time.  Theyve always given me a student discount (of course I have to ask) and when they were unable to provide me the vehicle I requested, they upgraded me for free to a better vehicle.  If I ever need to rent a car, this is definitely my place! Users/JoshuaSchraiber

20100506 14:42:49 nbsp When I rented a car here, first they told me no more economy cars were available, so I had to go one size up for the additional charge (instead of $38/day it was $43/day) Then I had to pay for both kinds of insurance and was given a Roadside Assistance Protection charge even though I didnt ask for it. Finally, you have to refill the tank before you return it to them which made the charge for me about $10 more than with Zipcar and more hassle. It does not seem like they are the business they used to be when the first person posted wrote here 4 years ago. You also have a miles driven limit (Zipcar does not) and they will charge you .15/mile for each mile you drive over the limit (I dont remember what it was.) Overall, they were polite and prompt. I would only recommend this business is Zipcar is not available. Users/lunelectronique

20121227 16:14:27 nbsp When Hoffmann Automotive accidentally doublebooked their courtesy car, they brought me over to Enterprise and rented a car for me to use for the day.  The service is very friendly.  Getting the car, despite not having a reservation, was very quick.  The return was quite slow because they were slammed with holiday rentals, but the one employee who wasnt out doing pickups/dropoffs was pretty impressive in how well he handled the long line.

They could definitely use better staffing around the holidays, though. Users/TomGarberson
