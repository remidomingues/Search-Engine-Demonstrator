The Entertainment Book is a nationally published coupon book, which is sold through their web site and through affiliates. The price is $25$45, depending on the edition, but drops to $9.99 after a few months into the year if you order online. The Sacramento book covers Davis, it is a 3/4 thick book priced at $45, $35 at Costco. The coupons are mostly BOGOF (Buy One, Get One Free) (AKA 2for1 discounts). This makes the book substantially less attractive for single people. The coupons are good for one year, starting in November. Most of the coupons are for national chains. There are many coupons for Fast Food fastfood restaurants, but its offerings for local Restaurants are limited to La Esperanza, Redrum Burger, The Hotdogger, and four recently Departed Businesses, . If you travel to the Bay Area much, it might be worth your while to purchase one of their Bay Area editions. These books can pay for themselves within one or two purchases. It is important to note that the only way to save money is not to spend it. However, you may spend less with these coupons.

The book is organized into colorcoded sections:
  Fine & Casual Dining
  Family Restaurants, Informal Dining & Carryout
  Home, Garden & Auto
  Retail & Services
  National Values (Travel, Retail & Services
  Hotels

This book is mostly sold through fundraisers (church, school, etc.). They buy them for a measly $5 off cover price, according to the web site.


I bought a similar book once. It was good at first, but then the retailers started refusing to accept the coupons, so it became worthless. Users/SteveDavison

One of these was given to me, and not having transportation to Sacramento, Ive never used it except at Taco Bell. Users/AmeliaCarlson aec

I once tried to use a 2for1 coupon thinking I could use the second later, but was told it was meant for couples and they wouldnt let me. Users/SteveDavison

20070518 15:53:46 nbsp Im always looking for ways to save money, so I bought the Entertainment Book.  I agree that the only way to save is not to spend.  But if Im going to spend anyway, like at the Nugget, Safeway or Regal Cinema, which I frequently do, I might as well have coupons.  I save $5 at the Nugget, plus several dollars on movies, every month.  Ive also used some of the car rental coupons. Id recommend it if there are coupons in there for things you would already be buying. Users/GinaMarie
