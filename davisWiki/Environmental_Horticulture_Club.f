The Environmental Horticulture Club is for all Town Flora plant lovers currently located at UC Davis. Whether youre interested in nursery management, landscape architecture, wildland restoration, or just like the Town Flora flowers in your front yard, this is an awesome club. Check out our meetings, field trips, plant sales, and restoration activities!

The EH club is currently involved in growing and selling mass amounts of plants! We have all kinds of vegetables, flowers, and very baby trees. This summer were going to be watering and growing like mad, so look for our super plant sales when the school year resumes and at the next Arboretum sale!
