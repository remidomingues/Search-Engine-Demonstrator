What Were About:
An epic is a narrative poem recounting the struggles and triumph of a legendary hero.

    From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being. As some of your own poets have said, We are his offspring.
                    Acts 17:2628



Life is a story with God as the author.



God is writing His epic story on earth. It is an epic saga of struggle, redemption and love unraveling as we live and our hero is Jesus Christ. Our role, as Christians, is to understand the role that God has given us in His grand story, find our place in it, and share it with those who may have not heard of it. In faith, we are given the role to live freely in His grace, loving ourselves and others as Christ loves us, and boldly leading in our relationships in faith.

The Epic Movement at UC Davis is a movement driven by this vision of a generation of Asian Americans understanding the story, and sharing this story in love.

We are a community of believers pursuing Godâ€™s Great Commission of making disciples of every nation by becoming a generation of Asian American students empowered by the Gospel, reaching those around us in love and showing them their true identity in Christ.

20090923 16:06:22 nbsp I clicked on this because I thought it was related to World of Warcraft, and I was hoping for some phat lootz.  I am now confused as to what this is. Is this a bible study group or something? Users/MasonMurray
   Its kind of like a large, musical church gathering on Thursdays...with more music and less preaching? I only know because Ive seen/heard meetings when they were right next to APIQ in Giedt...which was actually quite funny considering the two are confused sometimes because of their similar pronunciations. :)  Users/AshleyMatson
