The Epic Quad Battle took place on June 8, 2005 at the West Quad. The North and the South fought bravely and many great feats were accomplished. May this grand contest of strength and cunning continue to grace the UCD Campus campus hereafter.

The administration is trying to shut down the fourth Epic Quad Battle! See File(bureaucratic_asshattery.pdf) for more details!

Two armies formed at each end of the West Quad. The North boasted foam noodles and water balloons, and had as its mascot a close relative of the Stanford Tree. South was decked out in duct taped shields and weaponry, with a large and impressive flag. In all, there were perhaps 80 soldiers duking it out.

Although North was outnumbered and outclassed for armor, they did succeed in taking down the flag of the South. It was then retaken by the South, and a battle of champions ensued. The tree was beaten senseless several times. The screaming audience of a few hundred surrounded the field of war and many confused, yet happy, faces were glimpsed.

All is now quiet on the West Quad front.  Until the next Epic Quad Battle ensues!

20050608 13:29:03 nbsp I wasnt going to show up. Id heard about this event just a day or two previously, and wasnt sure if it was worth braving the gray and stormy weather. That and I was lazy. Then, from a strange feeling of excitement, I grabbed a pool noodle and headed to campus, expecting disappointment. I heard the screaming and saw the lines forming... and it was glorious. We should definitely do this again next quarter. Users/CindySperry

20050608 19:13:35 nbsp I saw it! i was amazed how long they kept fighting and wondered if the girl without pants was cold. Users/RohiniJasavala

20050609 00:54:16 nbsp I was so disappointed that I couldnt go and use my sheild a couple of the guys in Unitrans made for me.  They are the ones with the big blue banner baring the HF for the Knights of Hammerfall. Users/TracyPerkins

20050609 11:02:06 nbsp It was a weird day.....an Epic battle on the grass, Artists for Peace on the Patio..... Users/JimSchwab

20050609 11:41:22 nbsp It was amazing.  It was definitely at least a 31 score with the Southern Army totally bending over the Northern Army.  First, we stole all their buckets of water balloons (which the other side has confirmed to be 200+), we beat the crap out of their tree, and although momentarily foiled by the theft of our Standard ( flag), our brave few performed an epic flanking maneuver, stealing back the standard, and probably beating up the tree on the way by.  It was freakin awesome.  Also, a big shoutout to Manny is welldeserved for taking it like a man as he was heartlessly dragged across the quad, weaponless, still holding on for dear life to the flag.

20051007 16:54:00 nbsp the most glorious day of my life. Users/IanRamsay

20051007 18:23:42 nbsp Oh, I cant wait till next June... Users/CindySperry

20051011 22:46:57 nbsp Lets have the next one be East vs West, since that way theres a clear border (the walkway) between the two warring states. Users/ThomasFifield

20060412 16:26:48 nbsp Nice idea, but it would suck to tank on that walkway during battle.  I think its pretty obvious as it is. Users/JulieEickhof

20060412 17:56:01 nbsp What was this for, anyway? Users/JosephBleckman

20060412 21:33:51 nbsp Isnt it enough that it ... was? I mean, what better way to blow off some steam before finals than partake in the madness of the Epic Quad Battle? Users/CindySperry

20060422 22:09:57 nbsp Im not on facebook,  but would anyone be interested in forming a wiki phalanx for the second battle?  We shall have strength and honor... Users/CharlesWinkelmann

20060422 22:18:19 nbsp A phalanx in terms of us acting together as a unit, or in terms of the highly regimented and trained structure associated with the Greeks? Because as a Wiki Phalanx/Alliance, that might be cool, but not something where we need a lot of discipline. Users/MaxMikalonis

20060422 22:47:06 nbsp Max, im talking about the phalanx formation.  Im guessing 7 or 8 of us can train a bit.  I think it would be interesting to see a trained group move cohesively in a battle as glorious and chaotic as this.  The barbarians wont stand a chance.  Of course, a group of swashbuckling wikigoers, beholden to none but the wiki banner would be fun as well, and if training will be impossible, then count me in as a wiki samurai.

20060604 22:18:17 nbsp I noticed in the video that someone took a cheap shot to the back of the head.  For last years battlers: was the combat mostly honorable, or were there a lot of cheap shots to people busy fighting others?   Users/CharlesWinkelmann

20060605 19:27:04 nbsp http://ucdavis.facebook.com/event.php?eid2200929062 Heres the Facebook Event Users/MaxMikalonis

20080520 00:43:56 nbsp If you have never witnessed an Epic Battle, it is the mostblowing, heartpounding 60seconds of excitement youll ever have ... in Davis. I was a spectator, not a participant; perhaps thats why I enjoyed it so much. Actually, everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun, and I didnt see anyone get hurt. The energy died quickly and after five minutes of allout carnage, the warriors could barely thwack each other. Highly recommended. Users/SteveDavison

20080522 22:15:06 nbsp For Christs sake...the administration is seriously ridiculous. Misuse of property, lack of a sponsor and concerns with liability? Bull Crap...who gets seriously injured from a pool noodle? Nope...the chancellor doesnt want the world to know how BAD ASS Davis is, they want to keep up our facade as a peaceful community and open and engaging campus...they dont want our carnal sides sprawled on any major newspaper.   Users/ArianeMetz
  My views are mixed. Its an amazing event (I couldnt make it freshman year, even though I commented above), Ive always wanted it to happen, but I have to be concerned about what happened last year, as documented in http://daviswiki.org/Epic_Quad_Battle_3?actionFiles&doview&targetfallen.jpg this photo. Someone got got their skull fractured by a hammeresque device wrapped in a towel. Fortunately, the guy didnt sue, but seriously? If it was in fact just pool noodles, we wouldnt be having this discussion. If there was a strong organization putting on the event, one which could check peoples weapons and take those capable of causing harm (like lead pipes and broken exposed PVC), then Id feel more comfortable. And hopefully a strong org would be able to deal with potential insurance issues. Maybe Im just more sensitive to these issues and concerned about them since Bill, but I think its far more likely the administration is fine with our carnal sides, they just dont want our insides sprawled on any major newspaper. And, admittedly, they dont want the UCD name attached to any incident. Heres a pic of the hammer that did it:

20080523 01:35:39 nbsp This is one of those things, where if youve payed attention to the Universitys policy surrounding student activities, you would have to see it coming. And thats bullshit. Could I hate this administration any more? I dont think so. Users/ZackFrederick

20080525 19:54:02 nbsp you may have detected the pinch of sarcasm inbedded in my comment...but I stand by my original post.
Why dont we have the quad battle elsewhere? On the greenbelt maybe? Users/ArianeMetz

20100326 14:28:48 nbsp You sure it was not this hammer? It sounds more like it with the towel. Users/David.Tran
