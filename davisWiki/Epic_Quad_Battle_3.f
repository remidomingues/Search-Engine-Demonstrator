In the spirit of Epic Quad Battle and Epic Quad Battle 2, Epic Quad Battle 3 happened on Wednesday, June 6, 2007 at 12:00PM to 12:45PM.  It was the most glorious battle yet, as a new foe emerged.  North Side and South Side fought united (well, for like 2 minutes) against the Spartan menace.  Many warriors engaged in the melee, and fought for honor and glory.  Eventually, the champion of the North Side champion succeeded in slaying the Spartan and southern champions, and the North prevailed.

 Snapshots from the Battlefield

Many had fallen...the spirit of the great foam armies had waned, and now none stood to defy the sinister grip of meaningful purpose.

But even as the evil forces prepared midterms and small, two to three person discussion groups, warriors assembled. They clandestinely prepared the resistance, forging their weapons in cold foam.

Once again, the war cry enveloped the land, and all will regale their friends with the glories of the Epic Quad Battle EPIC QUAD BATTLE!!  modified from text in the Facebook event
