Epic Quad Battle Numero Cuatro is the hope that one day  preferably June 5, 2008 at noon  the Armies of the North and South can once again meet in glorious combat.  It will hopefully be the successor to Epic Quad Battle 3. The event was formally cancelled by the administrators of the facebook group. These students implore their peers not to show up.

However, UCD Administration The Evil Empire is trying to put down this rebellion once and for all.  They will be sending their UCDPD police to ensure that all students who so much as brandish a pool noodle will be arrested and tried for Disciplinary Probation crimes against the State.  They have already decreed that all of those who administer the http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid2483066231&refts righteous armies on the Facebook Book of Faces shall subject to a lawsuit for prior injuries in campus.

However, this situation is untenable. This great tradition shall not be squashed by the Empire. Bring your pool noodles to campus  and some tape and posterboard to put a sign of protest atop it! Against our righteous forces, the Empire stands no chance!

From our general:


20080518 00:20:22 nbsp How can they even arrest people? What laws have been broken? It is so cool to see and pretty awesome, I plan to skip class to watch :) Users/BrandonBarrette

20080518 00:27:09 nbsp I dunno  its a public place, so pretty much all uses are subject only to time, place, and manner regulations.  I really dont see how it would be any worse than Football or Rugby.  I really see this as a cool new UCD tradition  much more voluntary than Tank Rush, too.  I cant believe theyre going to stop it. Users/BrentLaabs

20080518 09:03:34 nbsp I cant wait to see the police march in on the ARC and shut down the gym and start a lawsuit against those sunovabitches that run that injury factory on campus.  Also, when are they going to arrest and confine those Ultimate Frisbee harbingers of doom that toss http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgibin/image?lookup1990.24.0416 an ancient symbol of http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/consortium/ancientolympics12.html accidental death? Users/JabberWokky

20080518 11:26:25 nbsp Would someone please provide a source to corroborate this? I have seen nothing other than rumors that indicate the university cares one way or the other about Epic Quad Battle. Obviously police are going to be there because there will be a lot of people, but police routinely patrol events with large crowds and this doesnt mean theyre going to arrest people who bring pool noodles.  Users/JeremyOgul
 Brent is the source. He knows a lot of people in university administration. wl

20080518 14:27:31 nbsp Last year there were injuries in EQB 3. People tucked in pvc pipe or metal rods with the pool noodles and instead of a soft harmless toy hitting your body, you have a lethal weapon hitting your body.  Users/SimonFung

20080518 15:35:20 nbsp wiki:wikipedia:Amtgard might be a good resource for ideas. Users/JabberWokky

20080518 16:24:15 nbsp sadly I have this image in my head of a ucd police officer getting swarmed by a pack of noodle wielding southerners and bad things happening..

but still, screw the man, go on with the plan. ROCK OUT WITH YOUR NOODLE OUT Users/StevenDaubert

20080522 20:36:42 nbsp Are there any viable routes of action we can pursue to challenge their decision? Users/AlexKistner

20080522 20:42:42 nbsp Sure, Alex.  You can write a letter to Fred Wood (mailto(fewood@ucdavis.edu) and request that they reverse their decision.  Be sure to emphasize that this is a campus tradition.

Second of all, you can attend the Epic Quad Protest to make sure that they understand that we want our Epic Quad Battle back.

Some of the organizers are working on moving it to Toomey Field, but that just isnt as cool.  It would also require the organizers to take out large quantities of insurance.  I really think that this University is far more concerned with risk management than it is with education. Users/BrentLaabs

20080523 18:38:56 nbsp so If I attend the quad battle, is SJA gonna pwn me? Users/StevenDaubert

20080524 11:15:16 nbsp Where can one purchase said noodles of doom? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080525 20:48:47 nbsp for a dollar at the dollar store? Users/StevenDaubert

20080526 22:48:52 nbsp I believe I know the reason why the administration is so dead set against the battle. Last year someone had to be taken away by ambulance. Ambulances cost money. If someone is seriously injured, the school could get sued. Its a money issue. However, if necessary, why dont people go off campus. The park in downtown is off campus property and that way the school will not be liable for any injuries. Users/Jedron

20080526 23:52:49 nbsp Apparently the university did get sued  http://www.theaggie.org/article/880 Users/JeremyOgul
    The university did not get sued. The article was wrong.  Users/OscarSabino

20080527 00:07:54 nbsp Wow. I didnt know that. One thing about the Epic Quad Battle from last year that really stood out in my mind was the enormous number of guys in speedos and capes. If they had tried that one year earlier before 300 came out, everyone would have thought they were very weird. Please, lets not do the speedos again this year. What has been seen cannot be unseen. Users/Jedron

20080527 23:31:57 nbsp I bet you its Suzie Miller and her Keep Davis Boring henchmen that are really behind this cancellation. Users/RobRoy

20080528 21:16:42 nbsp Wow, Epic Quad Battle being canceled? Lawsuits? This is too bad. It was a fun tradition when I was at UCD. Hope it gets sorted out. Users/PS2

20080529 23:47:15 nbsp Discipline actions? Thats reminiscent of threats that cutting class in high school would go on your permanent record. Still, they could force offenders to do community service or something. Naturally, they wouldnt round people up at the event, but would identify offenders via their beloved facebook braggings. Alternatively, if they wanted to get some good PR, the UC could start tazing all people wielding noodly appendages.  Users/CraigBrozinsky


20080624 15:07:54 nbsp I just found out that the injured student did not sue the University  his family simply asked the University to pay some medical expenses not covered by insurance.  I still cant believe UC Davis is so yellowbellied. Users/BrentLaabs
we live in a litigous society, and the few always ruin it for the many  Daubert
