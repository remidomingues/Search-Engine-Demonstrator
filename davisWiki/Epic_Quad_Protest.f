Since the Epic Quad Battle got cancelled on account to the UC Davis Administration being afraid of their own shadows, it appears that we have no alternative but to have an Epic Quad Protest.

Is the hope that on the day once reckoned for the epic quad battle 4, that there would be a gathering of students at the preordained time, to show protest for the events cancellation.  That time would be June 5, 2008 at noon, near the MU flagpole.

Since the Administration is already breaking out the threats of lawsuits:  DO NOT HIT ANYONE WITH FOAM.  It is for this right for which we are protesting.  This is a peaceful demonstration only.  That said, bring your pool noodles anyway as a sign of protest.  If possible, bring a sign to tape to the top of it.  Well be having a sign making party soon enough.  And dont worry that your sign holder is floppy  the Administrations logic for cancelling this event is even flimsier!
