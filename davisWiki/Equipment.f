The Wiki owns a variety of gear useful for Farmers Market Tabling tabling.  The equipment and the person(s) currently in possession is listed below.  If youd like to table for the Wiki, just get in touch with the folks who have the gear you need and arrange to get a hold of it!  The Wiki is paid up for tabling at the Farmers Market for a year, starting June 26, 2010.  It is unclear whether the years fee covers the remainder of 2010 or is good through June of 2011.  It costs $20 per year; if you want to table after 2010, you should get in touch with Users/PhilipNeustrom to see if the WikiSpot board will cover the cost.


If you need folding chairs for the tabling, Users/TomGarberson has some he can loan out for the day.
