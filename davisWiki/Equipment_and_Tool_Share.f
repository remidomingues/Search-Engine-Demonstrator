The Reason
Have you ever needed a piece of equipment or a special tool for loan to get your project done on campus and cant buy one yourself? This is always an issue with limited budgets and no easy way to communicate with other labs and University Departments departments to try an borrow the item. It is highly probable that the item you are looking for is sitting somewhere unused on campus. This page and associated email list will hopefully help alleviate this issue and help labs better connect so we can borrow tools and equipment from each other. If there were a database of tools and equipment on campus (there probably is one somewhere), that folks could search we could easily facilitate some exchange (either for loan or for Renting a Bike rent), but for now maybe we can use this wiki page and email list to act as a database of sorts.

The Email List
The email list can be used much the same way as a Freecycle list or Craigslist free section. Folks can subscribe to the list and post requests and lists of available tools and equipment that they have.

To join, send and email to listproc@ucdavis.edu with a single line in the body of the email: sub equipshare firstname lastname

For requests your email subject line should look like this: Wanted Stroboscope or Wanted Small test tubes

For available tools your email subject should look something like this: Available Sports Bio Lab: torque wrenches, radar gun

The Wiki Page

This page can also act as a database or sorts for equipment availability. Just post what your lab has available for short term loans or rent.

Available Tools and Equipment
The Gravel Detection Lab (an example)
