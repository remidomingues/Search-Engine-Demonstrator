Eric Fox hails from Southern California Los Angeles, CA. How he ended up at UC Davis is a complete mystery to everyone, himself included.

Eric claims many things, some of which are incredibly true, the rest dont make sense. One of these claims is that he is the Worst Bike Biker in the City of Davis. The number of accidents he has gotten into (with the aid of his loyal steed Sir CrashALot) is as follows:

  Softball field: 24
  Pedistrans (walking and running): 6
  Parked bikes: 7
  Moving bikes: 4
  Ditches: 1
  Town Flora Trees, bushes, and other vegitation: 5
  Brick walls: 3
  Other: ????

Fear not though, Sir CrashALot vanished into the night in the Spring of 2004. Eric was heartbroken and refuses another steed to this very day.

In addition, Eric has several archnemeses at UC Davis. They are as follows:

Cows Cow 1086  Despite claims to the contrary, Eric knows that Cows Cow 1086 is after him while simultaneously seeking world domination. Their epic battle has yet to come.

Ducks The Duck Assassians  Twice in the past year, these ducks have ambushed Eric, only to fail in their quest to eliminate him (most likely on the orders of Cows Cow 1086). It is only a matter of time before they return.

http://www.captainstupid.com/id5.html Oompa Loompas  While not at UC Davis, they frighten Eric completely. Anything with orange skin and green hair who works in a giant chocolate factory frightens Eric.

The Sewer Museum in Paris  An explanation of this would take far too much time.


Formerly an ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senator, Eric is known to one and all by a variety of nicknames. He will respond to them so feel free to use them. They are:

  Foxy
   see, Id spell it as FoxE (but pronounce it as Foxy), just because its like your last name and first initial sort of thing going on. Users/PaulIvanov pi
  EFoxy
  Hey you

The variety of nicknames led Eric to comment that he felt like the PuffDaddy of ASUCD in his farewell comments.

In addition, ASUCD Controller Devin Whitney has official declared that Eric is the Kramer of ASUCD. In order to fill this title completely, Devin and Eric are on the lookout for a Jerry and Elanie of ASUCD. (They have already found a George and Newman)

Although Eric took himself very seriously when in ASUCD Senate senate meetings, he often screws around when not in meetings. This carefree attitude has led to him blowing trumpets on the 3rd floor, racing up and down the halls on chairs, and attempting to name Eric Sanchez Eric the Wise (N.B. this name resulted after Eric tried and failed to name Eric Sanchez Eric #2 and Eric the Tyrant)

Eric was also able to get himself elected as the Senate President Pro Tempore, despite the fact that by all rights he should have been out of office. His campaign promise to his fellow senators was I cant disrupt the meeting if Im running it.

This promise stemmed from Erics misplacement of the gavels used to run the ASUCD Senate meetings, which effectively stalled the functioning of the government.

Eric is also the creator of the ASUCD Scandal Level Alert, which can be found on the third floor of the MU outside the SGAO Office. In hindsight, Eric admits he could have made the alert much more amusing, but is too lazy to rectify this situation.

As a further sign of Erics stupidity, ineptitude, or great comedic talent, take the following story. On Monday 5205, Eric was walking on the Quad. Despite having passed a resolution in support of the planting of trees and having been present of the tree planting ceremony the previous Friday, Eric walked face first into a new tree. He reasoned: It hadnt been there the last time.

Eric is also the proud cofounder of We Love Bad Movies Club. This club gathers every Friday night (allegedly. it has good and bad weeks) where the members watch horrifically bad movies. Some of the great films they have seen are:

  Torque
  Pootie Tang
  The Pacifer
  Cannibal the Musical

It has been decided that Eric is no longer allowed to have sugar (especially Ben & Jerrys Chocolate Therapy) since it literally sets him off. Eric has gotten hold of the ice cream twice. Both times have led to dire situations.



How about some comments discussing my zaniness? I think Im crazy enough to merit some kind of discussion. Do you agree?
