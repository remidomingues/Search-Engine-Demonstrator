Im a graduate student in computer science, working in the IDAV virtual reality lab. Ive been in Davis working on my Ph.D. for about 4 years now. Im just wrapping up data collection on a distance perception study in VR, and Im now going to be a fulltime employee at nvidia working on OS X OpenGL driver development (dont even ask about getting hooked up with free/beta hardware. I cant say how many times Ive heard that one now). Ill continue working on my Ph.D. part time until its done (no idea when thatll be).

Im a massive Apple Computer Mac fan, and would absolutely love to see OS X take over as the OS of choice for most people. The hardware is of course quite nice as well. And no, I would never have seriously considered using a Mac before OS X. Programming on the Mac has only made me love it more.

Im leaving Davis soon to go live in beautiful UC Santa Barbara Santa Barbara, but will stay connected to Davis at least as long as Im still working on my Ph.D. and while so many of my friends are still working on theirs.

Nonresearch time is for Bicycling bicycling, Flying flying, Making Bread baking, Snow Sports snowboarding, reading everything I can find and watching Movies movies.

Check out France Senecals public affairs show Its About You on KDVS. Its really quite good (although Im hardly impartial, as I used to help a small bit with engineering issues for the show). The show goes off every Monday morning at 8:30am.  KDVS has a lot of good shows, but France Senecal Frances show and Acadius Losts Bat Country 2086 are far and away my favorites.
