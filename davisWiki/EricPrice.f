Eric Price


yes that is his name.

He is a student of music at UC Davis. Hes active in many of the musical efforts that this town puts forth.

His instrument is the bass.

Currently Eric is working with the University Symphony Orchestra UC Davis Symphony and serving as Music Manager. Also he plays with local band The Keystones.

Earlier this year Eric performed in the production of the Rocky Horror Show. He played bass in the pit band and wore a pink wig and makeup. The title of pit band is sort of misplaced because the band was actually set into the stage and were an intrigal part of the show.
