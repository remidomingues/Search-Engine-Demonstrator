20130424 10:29:26 nbsp Hi Eric,
Im a newish user on San Jose wiki and looking for how to move/retitle pages. Im a longtime Mediawiki user, so I know page moves are sometimes an admin activity or a separate permission, but I created a page for a bike trail and then found that we needed a page for that place titled as a park. Are you an admin, or where can I find someone who is?  Users/BetsyMegas
