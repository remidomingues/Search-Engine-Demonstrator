20081225 09:19:44 nbsp Hey Eric. Perhaps youre unfamiliar with how the wiki handles businesses that are no longer in operation. On DavisWiki, we keep the page largely as it was while the business was in operation and just tag the entry with something saying it is no longer in business. It allows us to preserve parts of the business history of the town. Thanks for editing! Users/WilliamLewis
