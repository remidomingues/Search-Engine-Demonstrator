Eric Heiden is perhaps best known as the American speed skater who won 5 gold medals in the 1980 Winter Olympics.  Not surprisingly, he is widely considered to be one of the best speed skaters of all time.   After retiring from skating, he turned to professional bicycle racing in the mid 1980s.  Heiden took part in the 1986 Tour de France, and was inducted into the US Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1999.  He earned an MD from Stanford in 1991 and completed his orthopedic residency at UC Davis in 1996.  For several years, he worked as an orthopedic surgeon and assistant professor at the UC Davis Medical Center.  Throughout his years in the area, he served as a team physician for the Sacramento Kings, Sacramento Monarchs, and UC Davis Athletics.  Along with fellow doctor Massimo Testa, Heiden cofounded the UC Davis Sports Medicine and Sports Performance program.  Heiden eventually moved to Utah and continues his work as an orthopedic surgeon to this day.
