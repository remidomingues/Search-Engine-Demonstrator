20090510 15:19:29 nbsp I agree that http://daviswiki.org/Cowell_Student_Health_Center?actiondiff&version242&version141 the comment left by Users/doggydd didnt positively add to the Cowell Student Health Center page. What it did do though was illustrate one of the prejudices that people suffering from depression or other forms of mental illness have to deal with. It also shed http://daviswiki.org/Users/doggydd?actionuserinfo some light on the person who is using that account. On the wiki we have the chance to either sweep that sort of thing under the rug, or use it as a chance to educate and increase the potential for understanding and acceptance. Users/JasonAller
