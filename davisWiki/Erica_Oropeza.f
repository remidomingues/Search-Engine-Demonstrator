 Official Statement 
Hello Everyone! My name is Erica Oropeza and I am a third year double major in Sociology and Women & Gender Studies. For the past two years I have been working towards social justice and advocating for my fellow students by working at the CrossCultural Center (CCC), the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Resource Center (LGBTRC) and the Student Recruitment and Retention Center (SRRC).

While working within these different communities I have come to realize that students are not truly aware of all their resources on campus. As senator, I will address this issue by working to integrate the independent libraries on campus to the main Shields Library database. Doing so will provide students with easier access to all of their library resources which include the CCC, LGBTRC, WRRC, and the ethnic studies.

Another issue I will address as a Senator is to raise awareness about crisis management processes within the student body. I will accomplish this by working with administration to provide workshops and trainings on emergency plans to students. So, in the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, or even the presence of violent persons on campus, students will know where to go, who to contact, and what to do to help others. Informing students about crisis management plans will help prevent any healththreatening situations from escalating, furthering the security of all students.
Thank you all and please remember to vote for me, Erica Oropeza for ASUCD Senate!
