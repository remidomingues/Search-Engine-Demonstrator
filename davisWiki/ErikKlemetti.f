Erik is new to town (well, as of August 2006). Im a rock doctor working on volcanoes that arent in Davis. Right now, I tend to be found (when not at home or in my office) at Mishkas trying to catch up with the pile of reviews for the indie rock website http://www.threeimaginarygirls.com Three Imaginary Girls under the pseudonymn Erik Gonzalez (long story).

Beyond that, Im friendly. Really.
