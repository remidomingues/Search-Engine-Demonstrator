Erik is a fifth year here at Davis, a twin, and  plays lacrosse for the UC Davis team. Erik works at Bistro 33 where he is the head busser. He live on A Street in a 2 by 2, and apparently has a wicked good time as he can be seen out at the bars 7 days a week. Erik tends to be pretty friendly, so dont hesitate to send him a message.


>P.S. also, when drunk Erik can be a shameless flirt, so consider yourself warned.<
