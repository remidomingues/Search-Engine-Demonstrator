Fall 2007 Election


 Candidate Statement 

Hey Everyone!

My name is Erika Perez and I want to be your ASUCD Senate representative under the GO slate.

Over the past two years, my involvement with UC Davis Athletics as a Marketing and Promotions Intern and as an Aggie Pack Intern has been the most rewarding experience of my life. I have learned so much about this campus and I have the passion and drive to accomplish my goals. Additionally, I have developed relationships with key administrators, so I have the right connections to accomplish my goals as well!

My main goal is to create a strong sense of school pride by uniting the strengths of ASUCD and Athletics by outreaching to the campus community. Some of the ways I plan on accomplishing this is to distribute UC Davis marketing materials to ASUCD units and provide more funding for pregame festivals before football games!

I am also very interested in promoting diversity on campus. I will accomplish this by integrating cultural events with Athletics and have culturally themed Athletic events!

Thank you so much and vote me #1 this election. GO AGS!
