Fall 2007 Candidate Statement

Hey all! My name is Erin Harrington and I’m running for ASUCD Senate with LEAD this fall. I’m a 4th year double majoring in economics and international relations, a former ASUCD Business and Finance Commissioner, and I have recently finished a year studying European finance policies in Copenhagen, Denmark. I am excited for the chance to make Davis an even better campus than it already is.

The first thing I would want to see accomplished is getting the students more involved on campus. I would hope to publish a monthly calendar that lists events and meetings of various groups on campus. This calendar would be made easily accessible, so all students would need to do is pick one up every month and find what interests this most. Everyone has their own passions and interests, this calendar just helps students do what interests them the most.

Another issue that I would work on would be providing outreach to kids around the area. I would be working on a ‘personalized’ day for these kids. Through the help of Aggie Pack, we would bus students up for the day and give them a tour of campus. The personalization comes in by doing things that may interest them. For example, we may take a middle school sports team and have them practice with our college sports team later on that day. Having these outreach days would both increase Davis’ visibility and provide these kids with an opportunity that they would never otherwise have.

I hope you all can see the passion I have for this campus. Between being a 4th year and having studied in Europe, I believe I have a fresh perspective that I can bring to campus. Thank you for reading this, and please vote Erin Harrington as your #1 choice for senate this fall, and remember to rank the other LEAD candidates #2#6.
