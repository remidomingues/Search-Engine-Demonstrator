Erin Lebe is an  ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senator. She ran, and won, with the LEAD slate in the Fall 2008 ASUCD election.

 Candidate Statement 
My name is Erin Lebe, and I am a third year majoring in Political Science and Sociology here at UC Davis, running for ASUCD Senate with L.E.A.D. I am running primarily because ever since I was a freshman, I have had ideas for different ways to better our community here on campus. I decided that instead of leaving UC Davis seeing none of these things happen, I was going to make them happen.

I am running with LEAD L.E.A.D. because I believe in its mission statement of promoting diversity, and social justice, bettering the environment, giving students a better quality of life on campus, reforming ASUCD, and the university so that students are considered first, and using external advocacy so that state lawmakers are aware of students needs.

GO AGS!!!

If you have any thing you would like to see happen or change on campus please do not hesitate to send me an email and if you see around campus come over, and say Hi! and introduce yourself, I would love to meet you!

Dont forget on November 1214 vote Erin Lebe #1 for ASUCD Senate! Vote the rest of the L.E.A.D. slate #2#6!

 Platform Issues 

  I will work with R4 Recycling and Project Compost to make our campus more selfsustainable by getting a compost facility on campus. I will also ensure that a compost program is set up to coincide with the CoHo Coffee Houses transition to biodegradable containers.

  I will increase awareness of mental health services on campus by increasing advertising and outreach on campus while working with CAPS, The House, and HEP. I will work with the different centers on campus to create a partnership because recent polls have shown that minority groups tend to be more likely to suffer quietly rather than receive help. I will work with student housing to encourage holistic wellness programming and to have a wellness board on each dorm floor that tells students about different ways they can keep their mind and body healthy.

  Did you know theres a Starbucks going into the ARC? I want to ensure it is not used solely as a revenue builder, but is there to serve the students needs. I want the new Starbucks to be open at least until 3am during finals, if not 24 hours. I want to ensure that only students are employed there meaning that there would be more student jobs on campus.

  I will also be an advocate for the different athletic programs on campus including, but not limited to sports clubs and Aggie Pack. We are now a Division 1 institution and our athletics are a reason that a number of students choose to attend UC Davis. As representatives of the student body, we should support our athletics. I will be an Aggie Advocate on the senate table because I believe that aggie pride should be a substantial component of student life.

  Hey Joe,
Im sorry that your question has gone unanswered and I hope Erin doesnt mind me telling you the answer is no.  She didnt raise her hand at the forum to do this.  Sorry buddy.  GregWebb

20081111 15:25:23 nbsp How do you plan to help keep up financial support for Tier II mental health services in this year of steep budget cuts?  Especially given that the state may make even deeper cuts to the current FY budget, how will you address protecting these programs within Student Affairs? Users/BrentLaabs

20081111 23:29:02 nbsp Ive been told that at the forum she indicated that she was unwilling to increase Aggie Pack funding. I find that really curious. Having said that, she seems to be the most qualified Lead kid this year. I just wish that she would be more honest about what her intentions are. Users/JoseBleckman

20081112 20:23:17 nbsp Im happy to see that at least one of our candidates has a sustainability project in mind that isnt simply to recycle more and get professors to print double sided. I think composting is a good next step. Users/AmanpreetSingh
