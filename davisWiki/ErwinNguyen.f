Describe Users/ErwinNguyen here.

20121204 11:36:54 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  Please have a look at Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner  it outlines some very useful information for business owners and representatives.  The comments that are marked on Get Fit Davis are obvious sockpuppets  they have the same IP address you do (and I assume youre Users/ErwinPeak as well?)

Its conceivable that theyre different people just editing from the same computer/network, but the comments are awfully suspicious.  The Sockpuppet marker is used to indicate to readers where theres an IP address match.  Readers can draw their own conclusion about whether its the same person or not.  If they are fake accounts and fake reviews, though, thats just shadiness factor shady. Users/TomGarberson

20121204 18:45:19 nbsp Tom, Yes I am ErwinPeak as well! But no longer under that email address since the change of ownership. So here is my dilemma, our business wanted new reviews and they have been asking members at our gym to write a review and asking them to do so onsite. But this innocent looking sock puppet is actually really shady looking. Am I able to just delete these reviews and just ask member to do them at home? I tried deleting them, but they keep getting edited. I guess im not suppose to delete them. What is the proper way of going about this, Tom? Users/ErwinNguyen
