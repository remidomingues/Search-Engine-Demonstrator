When you smell Cows cow dung, think Essence of Davis. Not currently available in stores.

An odors odor naturally occurring in the vicinity of Tercero, but on a hot summer night anywhere in town is fair game. West Davis is hit particularly bad, where people have been known to quit smoking rather than brave the outside stench.
  For a second opinion on the matter: I live in West Davis, and all I ever smell is flowers and trees. Quitting smoking rather than braving the outside stench is totally ridiculous. There are towns that smell like sh.., but Davis is NOT one of them! Users/SteveDavison

Excrement is not the only Essence of Davis there is, or ever has been. Current UCD students are clueless about this, but anyone who grew up in or has lived in Davis for more than a few years remembers the smell of tomatoes in the air in the fall, especially when the Hunt Wesson Plant Hunt Cannery was open for business. The Davis Enterprise Enterprise columnist Bob Dunning tries to wax poetic about the smell of tomato soup each September in one of his columns.

Folks who live around Sudwerk will recognize the distinct smell of brewing beer.  Some find it pleasant, others not so much.


Before I moved here I was under the impression that this whole town reeked of shit, but with the exception of the Tercero area that has turned out not to be the case at all.  Users/DanMasiel

20041212 14:27:36 nbsp I remember those tomato soup days.  I spent most of the summer with a craving for tomato soup.  I havent decided if I miss the big tomato spills that happened several times each summer when the huge tomato trucks would take turns too sharply.  Users/BevSykes

  20051206 11:31:07 nbsp The Equestrian Center is not moving, unfortunately. It WAS going to move out past Russell Ranch Wildlife Area Russell Ranch (on Russell Russell Blvd.) to a huge 75 or so acre lot...  Users/StaceyGalbreath

20060404 21:38:23 nbsp Occasionally I detect it in front of the ARC, if the wind is blowing just right. Not strong enough to be really unpleasant, though.  Users/NicholasCorwin

20060505 22:10:45 nbsp I dunno, theres something kinda comforting about having your windows down when you come back into Davis from being elsewhere.  Usually my reaction, is  sniff smells like home.  Haha. Users/JulieEickhof

20070608 12:49:44 nbsp The cows just arent that bad.  When the pig barn was located right next to EUII (now Kemper Hall)... now THAT was some smelly shit.  I got used to the cow smell pretty quickly, but I never did get used to the pig smell.  Yuk. Users/NicoleTheWonderNerd

20070608 15:51:01 nbsp I dont think its too bad either...I might be saying that though because I have lived in Davis all my life and am used to it. Nothing says summer like having the Delta Breeze with the essance of herbivore. Users/MyaBrn

came to davis. did not see any cows on my informal tour or during orientation. did not see any cows until october, actually.
i live in segundo  i dont smell any cows unless i visit my friends in tercero. and even tercero isnt THAT bad...

its madness that davis has a reputation for smelling like cows... because, honestly, i see infinitely more cows on that lovely 5 north on the way up to davis... i get anywhere near davis and it stops. Users/MacMoore
