I am 21 years old, live in Palo Alto, CA and Transfer Students transferring to UCD for fall 08. I like pets, but do not have one now. I also like reading books, hiking, hanging out, studying about the world, social science, history, religions, languages, making films, gym, swimming, etc...
Right now I am finishing my classes at Foothill community college, where I am having lots of fun, friends and good time. Itll be pretty hard to leave but I am very excited to start studying at UCD.
