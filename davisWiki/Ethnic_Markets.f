 Chinese/Vietnamese 
There are a large number of Chinese and Vietnameseowned restaurants/markets in south Sacramento on Stockton Blvd. between Fruitridge Rd. and Florin Rd. The area is about 20 miles away from Davis but there is also a Costco further south on Stockton Blvd. to make it worth your while. A few of these markets as well as other Asian grocers are listed below.
