Address(Eureka Avenue) is a residential street in Central Davis

Somebody here on the block between West 8th Street and Antioch Drive has a rusty safe in their front yard. This street is a nice way to get downtown from the Davis High School on 14th Street if you are on a bike, because it is shadier and less busy than B Street. Around the intersection with Mills Drive it has a weird bulge to the east. There is also a house with some cool architecture opposite Antioch. Shortly after crossing 8th Street it intersects with College Park and is Bollards blocked to car traffic.

Users/NickSchmalenberger once got a http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70145132 not nice lamp for freeonthestreet here and somebody else got a tent with no bag.
