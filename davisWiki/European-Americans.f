EuropeanAmericans, many from Spain, settled what is now California and the Davis area in the early 1800s.  They brought a wide variety of various regional heritages from across the continent of Europe.  Racially they range from the dark skinned people of the Mediterranean skirting the Middle East to the fair haired and skinned Scandinavians.

If you are new to the area from Europe, you might be interested in the services at the International House.  Various European cuisines of varying authenticity are found at some of the restaurants in town.  Many more European restaurants are located in nearby Sacramento or Winters, such as the Fox & Goose Pub, Streets of London Pub and the Irish Pub & Coffee House.

 Culture 

If you are interested in the history of Western Civilization, you might be interested in the Society for Creative Anachronism, which recreates the middle ages from a eurocentric (although not exclusive) perspective.  Various Renaissance Faires exist throughout the Northern California area, some specifically oriented toward Italian or Celtic heritages.

Traditional European folk dance is well represented in Davis with the English Country Dancers and Merrie Pryanksters.  European music inspires some people in the Davis music scene, including our own Davis High School Madrigal Singers.

 History 

Spanish immigrants were the first Europeans to settle the area, founding Mission Dolores.  From that location, J.M. Vaca and J.F. Pe√±a founded Rancho Los Puttos in 1842. This massive ranch stretched from Vacaville to the edges of South Davis.  Eleven years later, Joseph B. Chiles established Rancho Laguna de Santos Calle by purchasing part of Vacas land. One of the subdivided areas of Chiles land was Jerome C. Davis stock ranch which is now Downtown Davis.

 UC Davis 

  Anybody know what resources for European students doing study/in the grad programs at UCD are?

 Demographics 

People identified primarily as EuropeanAmericans comprise about twothirds of of Davis Demographics population, a clear majority, on par with the rest of the United States.   UC Davis underrepresents EuropeanAmericans by a larger percentage than it does AfricanAmericans, however the proportion of underrepresentation is much smaller.  The number of EuropeanAmericans identifying students at UC Davis is almost the same as the amount of Asians Asian identifying students.

20060118 09:54:52 nbsp It was strange at first that there was an EuropeanAmericans page. I think thats because I perceive whites as not fully acknowledging their European heritage. I mean, they do, but theres not need for white people to say that theyre European since being an American in the international world is all about being white. Users/RitchieLee

20060118 12:19:10 nbsp What you say makes sense.  Being a white person of mixed race it there is no way to identify completely with a particular culture.  I myself have taken to the German heritage.  Having a schmorgousborge of options I suppose I really could have been any European I wanted to be.  However, I do find it comforting to have some cultural ideal to cling to as my own.  It may seem silly to some; but it gives one some form of identification.  Dare I say something to be proud of?  I know that can be a bit taboo, but it seems a great way to summarize the whole feeling. Users/AndrewBanta
