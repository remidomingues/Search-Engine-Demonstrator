Hello,

     My name is Evan S Gray. I have lived in Davis, Ca for around 6 years now and am happy with the town and its vibe. I am the owner of Astrinet.net and am very proud to be servicing Davis with products that are built on the concept of Quality over Quantity.
     I have been married for six years to Cecilia M Walker and we have two amazing boys Aidan and Auron Gray. We are people who believe that the community you live in is like your family and we are happy and proud to be doing our part.




20091112 10:17:19 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for clarifying that the account called Users/astrinet doesnt speak for the business. This is one example of the problems that can stem from people editing with an account that has a title instead of a name. Users/JasonAller

20091130 20:29:44 nbsp Are you making legal threats against me? You wouldnt be the first. Let me save you the trouble and tell you that I am wellversed in defamation law and that I know a baseless legal threat supposedly based on that law when I see it. Baseless legal threats will get you nowhere, lead to tons of illwill, and will lead to you being banned from Davis Wiki. I must demand that you IMMEDIATELY remove all insinuations of threats of legal action against any editor of Davis Wiki for their editing activity here.

Im asking if youre affiliated with Sonic.net, and if so, in what manner? It appears so, but you have refused to provide an answer, despite being in a position to do so. You can either answer the question or let what Ive figured out about your affiliation with Sonic.net remain. However, this is a community resource and removing factual, relevant information is frowned upon here. You admitted to such an agreement on Twitter and all the evidence points to the existence of one, so this isnt just idle speculation.

As an editor, you are free to make the contributions you wish to the wiki. Please remember, however, that Davis Wiki isnt a business listing site, but merely a community site that happens to have some business listings. Simply deleting things isnt nice and it leads to a less useful community resource. If the issue here is that you are contractually obligated not to disclose the nature of your relationship, please remember that a contract is only binding on the parties to it. It has no effect on third parties like me who choose to write about things.

Anyway, I urge you to write about all the cool things your company is doing. I read something about a printing deal. You said you offer IPv6 service.... that might be something you should write about to sell your service to the geeks that inhabit this town. Write about your wireless network plans. It seems like you want to give Instaconnect a run for their money, which as Im sure youre aware, would be a good thing.

You shouldnt just write about your company, though. I also urge you to write about all the things you like about this town. I know Im partial to stuff like no toad sexing in Davis and Zombie Attack Response Guide. Things like The Baxter House and Stevenson Bridge are cool as well.

     I would concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement  Daubert

20091130 22:12:29 nbsp Im glad youve brought more broadband competition to Davis. I look forward to learning more about your company! Users/RyanMikulovsky
