Evan Hart is the heir inherit to 720 Anderson Road Anderson. He is well loved by his brother, Brett Hart, even though Brett seems to piss off Evan quite a bit. Evan is a third year and lives up the junior experience to the fullest. One night he brought a girl over to 720 who insisted upon licking everyone in the house, including Brett. He enjoys experimentation of all kinds. He likes to play his guitar load and loves effects pedals. This kid is young and all ready on top of his game. Davis... watchout.

Evan is also a guitarist for Buildings Breeding and pursues a solo project called http://www.myspace.com/uguw Underground, Underwater.
