I am but a lonely Grad Students grad student amongst a sea of Undergraduate Students undergrads.  I will use them to make myself feel young again!  I am in the Applied Science PhD program and will be working both at Davis and in wiki:WikiPedia:Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory Livermore for the next 4 years!  Boo ya!

That is all for now...
