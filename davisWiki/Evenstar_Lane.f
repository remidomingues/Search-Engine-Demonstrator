Evenstar is the last name of Arwen Evenstar, a brave Elven warriormaiden who helped the four hobbits escape from the Nazgul by calling on the river. Arwen was Elronds daughter, and lived in Rivendell and Lorien for roughly 3000 years in contentment, until she met and fell in love with Aragorn. After the War of the Ring, Arwen and Aragorn were married on midyears day, and Arwen became Queen of Gondor.
