This is a place to post events.  Just enter text as you would into the wiki.  Try to use links to the pages associated with venues, etc.  You can easily delete the event after posting it (if you make a mistake, etc).  To include a picture you must link to the picture externally:  use {{{http://mypicture.com/picture.jpeg}}}.  Please be mindful of posting large images and instead use text wherever possible.


If youre wondering why this page exists in addition to Events Board (and this page is an exact copy) its because this page is the address where the LiveJournal server pulls the information from, and youre not allowed to update that information on LiveJournal.  Sometimes the past (which is nearly the present) catches up with us.
