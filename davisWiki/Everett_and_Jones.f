Everett and Jones is a local BBQ restaurant chain located in the Bay area. They also sell a BBQ sauce that can be bought at SavMart and Safeway but for some vexing reason not Nugget. This is slated to change thou, Nugget had a hiccup because E&J were in the middle of switching to a larger distributor. Look for E/J at nugget soooooon

Mrs. Jones moved to the bay area in the 60s from the South and promptly decided there was no good BBQ sauce. The lids are color coded to show heat. The yellow is the medium (but its rather mild and quite good all around) and the red is the spicy (a little tangier and with a some more zip)
