This section of the The Greenbelt Davis Greenbelt connects to Arroyo Park Arroyo and Sycamore Park Sycamore Parks and the Aspen Greenbelt.  It is located in West Davis in the Evergreen neighborhood.


At the east end of the greenbelt, where it meets Shasta Drive and just south of the University Retirement Community, is the Tree Davis MemorialCommemorative Grove. The grove was begun in 2002 and contains a number of trees planted as memorials to departed members of the community as well as trees planted to commemorate living people. The Rotary Club of Davis did  muchneeded maintenance to the area of the Grove in 2008.
