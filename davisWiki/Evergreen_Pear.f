The city has planted Evergreen Pear (Pyrus kawakamii) around Davis because of properties that make it attractive as a city maintained tree: 

   It grows to a wellproportioned height of 15 to 30 feet and no taller
   Its roots wont lift the sidewalk
   It retains most of its leaves throughout the year (harsh winters make it go somewhat deciduous)
     If leaves dont fall off during the winter, nobody has to sweep them out of the street
   Its small, white flowers look nice from a distance. 

The leaves are mediumsized, bright green and glossy, and the bark is dark brown and coarse. Shooters are a bit of a problem, and require some maintenance now and then.

It has been dubbed by some Cumbleberry Trees for the semen like smell it exudes.
