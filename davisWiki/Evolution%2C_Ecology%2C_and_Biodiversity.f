This was once the Zoology major, but was changed to EVE because it covers more than just the study of animals. It has now been renamed to Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity (EEB), since it offers an understanding of the diversity and distribution of (living) animals. Students still address this as the EVE major.  Many people who are interested in theoretical and/or quantitative ecology minor in Quantitative Biology and bioinformatics or major in Mathematics Applied Mathematics and minor in EEB.  This set of course work focuses on the mathematical models used to develop general ecological theory and also solve ecological problems.
