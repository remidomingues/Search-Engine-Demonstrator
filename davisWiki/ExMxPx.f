ExMxPx was founded during the spring of 2002 in Sereno Hall in the Regan area. Roommates Stan O. and Joao Alameida bonded over a love of alcohol and contempt for authority, a full two years before some imitator decided to bite their style and ended up losing his life in the process. Having gone into dormancy following the end of the academic year, a chance meeting deep in the heart of the Balkans between guitarist O. and Motorheads Lemmy Killmeister convinced the former of the need to reform the band. In the fall of that year, ExMxPx was expanded to include Danny Dickason on guitar, Nick The Freakin Knife Rohlik on drums and Vinny Courtoy on Bass. Rumours of outside involvement have as of yet not been substantiated. The newly formed group held practice in their apartment until a series of police visits forced them to seek refuge elsewhere. ExMxPx had the pleasure of playing their first show with cofounders of Davis music Filthy Pete and the Moustaches at the now defunct Hangover House in South Davis. The show was a rousing success, reportedly the first ever Davis house show that did not involve a digeridoo and a golden retriever named Blotter. A series of shows took the group as far south as Fresno, CA and as far north as Zanes House in North Davis. Most infamously, a show that features the combined talents of Biking Under the Influence, (now defunct), Phase III, Filthy Pete and the Moustaches, and the aforementioned ExMxPX filled Kleiber Hall with an estimated 300 people, mostly high school aged kids. Authority was spat upon as drugs and libations were openly consumed. The show was a disaster and resulted in the expulsion of ExMxPx and all its members from Davis Music Scene, a ban which still holds to this day. ExMxPx played its last ever show in a Fresno Pizza Parlor in February of 2003. Rumours of past reunions under a variety of pseudonyms have surfaced, but these orgiastic displays of chicanery cannot be confirmed as actual performances. Since that time, members of ExMxPx have become involved in a variety of projects. Most notable are The Man in the Black Pajamas, Unless, Womyn Speaks, and the shortlived quartet, Fascism in the Land of Freedom.

ExMxPx is an acronym of multiple meaning. Employing the notion of detournement popularized by Debord and members of the Situationist International, the term ExMxPx can be construed as:

 Extreme Menstrual Pain
 Earthlings Must Perish
 Es Muy Peligroso
 Eat More Poultry
 Everyone Meet Paul
 Vinny is in France
 The Beatles
