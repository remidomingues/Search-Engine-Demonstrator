Sometimes, well, sometimes things explode and catch on fire  right here in Davis!  These arent the only disasters, as there are power outages and falling things from time to time as well.


 Exploding car 

At about 11:20PM on Monday May 2^nd^, 2005, a car fairly randomly exploded outside of IHOP on Cowell Blvd..  I was there, and it was entirely stationary.  No one was in the car, and a little fire started on its left tire.  The fire spread to the rest of the car, and the whole thing exploded.  No one was harmed and the Fire Department responded immediately.


 Dumpster on fire 
At 10:45 PM on March 21, 2006 a dumpster in the alleys alleyway behind the U Mall was on fire.  Interestingly, and likely unrelated, a few weeks prior to this there was an oil spill right next to this dumpster (caused by the trash compactor).

I was walking by and I saw a small fire so I called the fire department. They arrived about 4 minutes later, after it had spread to the entire dumpster and onto the wall. As I was leaving I noticed a bottle of lighter fluid about 100 feet away.  Users/AmyZimmerman
