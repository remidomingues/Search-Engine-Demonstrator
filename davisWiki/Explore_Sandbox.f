A place for experimenting with the Explore sidebar on the front page. BR

My original clustering of topics by broad subject is apparently falling apart on the front page.  While in my original revamp there were a few things that were more gag pages (like cows, hot sauce, meat market), theres stuff that should be subtopicofasubtopic stuff popping up on the main explore page:  barber shops, nimby, ...  maybe there should be a page that organizes davis philosophicalpolitical issues, a page for services (like barber shops), and a page for religion (so you can put places of worship, religions, whatever),..  just a thought.   Maybe we should have an organization party so we can bring more quality content closer to the top level... some things are not as well placed as they should be.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
   It needs rennovation.  Outgoing Links should be taken into account, and just because something is important doesnt mean it needs to be in Explore.  We should try to categorize things?
   Okay:  We need to stop throwing random pages into Explore, really, please.  please.  again, please.  I know your page is really important.  But if you just made it, and if it contains less than, say, 20 links, then please dont add it to explore.  We need to work together and refactor explore so that its actually useful to people.  Right now I think its just a scattered group of a ton of pages.  Some are good, some are bad (linkwise, is what I mean).  I understand that sometimes its hard to find a place for a page to be linked from, but we need to start thinking before we throw things there.  We should strive to reorganized Explore based on items from Site Organization.  Important pages (not based on content or our personal opinon of important) ought to go into explore, and it shouldnt have 80+ links  thats just useless (especially because of the thin+long layout of the explore page as it sits on the Front Page).  Discuss any organizational ideas on this page.  Users/JamieRaba did a really good job of coming up with Explore many months ago, but the site has outgrown his hey look, cool stuff approach? Users/PhilipNeustrom
        My thoughts exactly.  When a site exists at the scale that DavisWiki does, I think you cant put all the pages up.  And even pages that have 5 links can just be a bit circular, in that they refer all to each other.  I think there is ONE way you could have a wellstructured model that also emphasizes cool stuff.  Check out the OLD yahoo layout:   http://web.archive.org/web/19970330043815/http://www11.yahoo.com/ ..  Where the MAJOR categories are the focal structure, but then there are selected subcategories listed.  That can work pretty well.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
             I am observeing that most of the edits are lately to businesses/restaurants, political pages, student groups, and personal pages.  And if you look at the crown jewels of this site, they focus around those ideas.  But edits dont matter as much as page usage.  Do you have any usage stats, phil? Users/JaimeRaba jr

That should give a fairly good idea of what people look for on the site.

 Step 1 
Lets find the most important (structually) pages.  Then lets organized them.  Lets make sure all pages in the current Explore have links from at least 5 other pages.  (Click on the pages title to do a search for the title string)


Ken, James  I put Spiritual Organizations inside of Organizations instead of Explore.  If I were looking for a religious place I would look at Organizations?  I think we might need a massive rehaul of Explore come the creation of UC Davis, Davis and a few more general pages. My concern is that while a catalog of churches is useful, theres a lot w/o pages right now and the few that do have very little outgoing links.  I think the page ought to be in Explore in a bit, but maybe not right now.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

Can we add Hotels to this?  Users/KenBloom
   I think the wiki should strive to be the best resource for folks in davis, not nec. a tourism thing.  Maybe we can collect tourist/visiting things into a page and throw it on explore.  Besides, that Hotels page has only one new outgoing link right now.
     Can you think of anything else touristrelated (besides Hotels)? And the Hotels page will presumably get edited and filled in with links. Part of the reason for this page is to make people notice. (And of course Ill add some infos)  Users/KenBloom

Attempt #3


questions/concerns:  I think LSA, GSA should be on Explore, but as of now they dont link to much.  Theyre both fantastic or soon to be fantastic, but I think they should link to a great deal of pages (if possible), because Explore is supposed to be a starting point.  Id help out but I dont know anything about either organization :)  Even links to sort of silly things would be good, because its likely that a law student or a graduate student would first click on GSA or LSA, seeing it there.

I think that this is a good start, but there seems to be the problem of wanting to just throw in a page thats good just because its good  not because its really in the right spot.  Id say our reorganization of Explore needs to wait for probably 50 or so more pages in the wiki.  Right now, Im going to spend my time instead making sure all our pages are linked up well and organized in a general>less general>specific>more specific manner.  I.E. we have Frat Parties, free beer, but no Parties and Drinking pages.  Just my 0.02  Users/PhilipNeustrom

I totally agree.  But, I also think that people who would love the site if they clicked on the right pages might give up on the site when it seems completely geared towards each section of town.  I actually didnt necessarily choose the BEST pages to put in there, but just ones that linked to lots of other ones, or were at least exciting.  I know theyre sometimes subclasses, but I figure as far as utility goes, I think it would get people more excited about the site.  Sometimes, I think the less exploratory indivual gives up one daviswiki when it just seems like another Davis411, which perhaps the breakdown by city area might suggest to the unitiated.  The page of the day does a lot to despell that notion, but the explore setup does not at all reflect where the dominant amount of content is.  Is there any way to see what the most contentheavy pages are right now, just out of curiosity?    jr

 Jaime, we took your general layout from attempt #2, beefed it up a touch, and moved things around so as to focus on more interesting pages first.  Thanks a ton for your work and suggestions, it made it so much easier.  Users/MikeIvanov

Anyone else interested in fixing Explore? IMO, it is way too bloated. Stuff like Cows, KDVS, and Photography, while interesting, arent things people really need to see on the front page.  Users/AndrewChen
