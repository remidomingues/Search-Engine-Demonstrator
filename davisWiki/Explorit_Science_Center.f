 General Information 

Explorit Science Center is a NonProfit Organizations nonprofit organization committed to the mission: To ignite and foster curiosity about science and nature through inquiry and discovery. Its a great place to visit with your family and friends for handson science fun. Popular public events include the Family Exploration programs which often feature guest scientists from the community. Weeklong summer day camps and birthday parties with handson science themes are popular programs just for children.

At its main site, Explorit Science Center located at 3141 5th street hosts school field trips on weekday mornings. Teachers can choose from Discovery Lessons, Discovery Labs, Nature Labs and Nature Safaris. In the wider, 16 county region, Explorit travels with mobile programs which serve elementary schools and community sites. These traveling programs include Classroom Adventures and family science nights such as Science in Your World and Health in Your World. The Explorit facility in Davis is small (but the reach of its traveling programs is very large) but definitely worth visiting on a regular basis. Its style of handson activity is different from most other science centers. Explorits handson inquiry style involves the use of common, familiar materials for observations, investigations and experiments so that the activities relevance to everyday life is made clear to both children and adults. All Explorit programs involve opportunities for honing observational skills, questioning, problemsolving and critical thinking by all ages. The Explorit Science Center has The Science Mosaic Bench out front.

 Recent History: Summer Science Camps, Facebook and Citizen Science 
Explorit offered its very popular Summer Science Camps again in 2013 with more than 400 children participating in the six week session.  Explorits Facebook page and its website continue to be a good way to follow whats happening to the energetic science center. New in 2011 Explorit created its ongoing Community Science Project Wheres My Spider that has included a couple of art contests and continues to accept stories and poems about spiders (at  http://groups.dcn.org/exploritcspwow) and is slowly building a database of Yolo County spiders. Explorits Spider database is housed at iNaturalist (http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/whereismyspider) and accepts (with registration) input observations from anyone who can record spider observations with a digital camera. There is a iNaturalist app for this too!

 Recent History: Explorit Looking Forward 

January 30th 2011, was the last time Explorit Science Center offered regular public access at its 2nd Street location.  Due to a 1525% drop funding to nonprofits and a 14% annual drop in donations,  Explorit had to make the painful decision to close the 2nd street location and lay off all but three paid employees. The centers temporary closure will affect programs such as Classroom Adventures, Science Assembly Programs, Young Scientist Series after school programs, and Family Science Nights.  Schools who want to visit Explorit may still be able to  please call.  The current Exhibition, Forces of Nature, is open on the first full weekend of each month. See the Explorit website for other activity.

August 2013: Time has passed, a couple of new exhibitions have been well received, and the programs listed above are available again so check the website for public hours, special events, and programs that travel to schools in 16 counties!

The recession that started in 2008 and significantly affected Explorit as well as very many other nonprofits and businesses is still not fully recovered. Explorit continues to work very hard to regain its prerecession financial status and encourages ongoing support by all those who see value in its science education mission, To ignite and foster curiosity about science and nature through inquiry and discovery.  There is a Donate button on the website homepage.

 History 

 Explorit celebrates 30th years in 2013 

To celebrate 30 years of providing informal science experiences to the general public and schools Explorit is hosting a special fundraising event on October 19, 2013 at its 3141 5th Street, Davis location. See Explorits web homepage for information about the event and how to purchase tickets.

 Explorit celebrates 25th anniversary in 2007

To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Explorit hosted a handson family science festival on April 28, 2007. The free public event took place at both Explorit’s main facility, 2801 Second Street, and at the Mace Park Branch, 3141 Fifth Street.  Visitors took a trip back in time to see how Explorit has grown and changed since its founding in 1982 and tried out some favorite science activities from the past 25 years.  Special events at the festival included the unveiling of the “Give Explorit a Hand” donor wall and the dedication of Standing Wave, an outdoor scienceart sculpture by local artist Chris Daubert.  Later this year, Explorit will be planning a reunion gathering for the many staff, trustees and volunteers who have contributed to the Centers growth and success since 1982.

 Explorits Expansion 

After several years of planning and fundraising to expand its facilities, in spring 2006 Explorit publicly announced its plans to expand into the south side of the Davis Indoor Sports Center building. This new site opened to the public on September 23, 2006 and was celebrated with a Grand Opening Festival on October 14, 2006.  The facility features handson exhibits, a Discovery Room, a Microscope Nook, a Wet Lab, an Animal Alcove and more.  Additional galleries and exhibit spaces will be phased in over the next year at the site. This 2801 2nd Street site is now Explorits primary public location. The old location, the Explorit Nature Center at 3151 5th Street, continues to be used by Explorit for school field trips focused on nature themes that utilize the surrounding park, as the main site for summer day camps and as the hub for Explorits outreach programs. More information is available at the Explorit website. Before Explorit was in its Mace Ranch location, it was at 2828 Cowell Boulevard, where there was a large mural of a head with long, wild hair. This building now has offices for the UC Davis Bookstore, and has a mural of the Aggie Logo. When Explorit was there in the early 1990s the road was called Chiles Road.

In February of 2010 they were on the evening news saying that they were $600,000 short on a balloon payment that would come due in August. There was talk about teaming up with another science museum in the Sacramento area to get funding. However, the teaming was not a feasible option and so Explorit relinquished the building to its lender and is now functioning from its facility in Mace Ranch Community Park at 3141 5th Street that has been its homebase since 1992. The recession affected Explorit very drastically (as it has many nonprofits) and the Center is working hard to rebuild its original vigor and services to Davis, Yolo County and the Greater Sacramento Region. The Explorit Board is passionate about the Centers informal science mission and welcomes inquiries about its progress.

20040812 15:21:54 nbsp I attended their 2004 Perseid viewing, and while I only caught the tail end of the Explorit organized part, I had a really nice time.  The location was near perfect  far, far West Davis (so far that it was actually in the Outskirts of town)  and the sky was crystal clear.  They had telescopes and neonglowing lights set up, but they were closing up shop as we got there (around 1AM). Users/PhilipNeustrom
