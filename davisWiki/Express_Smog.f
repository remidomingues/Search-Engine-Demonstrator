20100331 17:18:45 nbsp Sounds like those violations work in favor of customers Users/AmitVainsencher

20100606 09:37:33 nbsp Yes and no Amit. You are paying for a that is not provided. Although you get a clean slate, your car could be a gross polluter and you wouldnt even know it. CHP does set up roadside test stations, and although now you feel awesome that you didnt have to pay for said repairs, if CHP stops you, you will be fined and then have to pay for said repairs anyway.

Now I know what you might be thinking. Im a college student. Im broke There is the Consumer Assistance Program(CAP). CAP will help you pay or you may get a 2 year waiver. In that 2 years you could save up for said repairs. There is also the option for the government to give yo $1000 for your car. For a lot of us thats more than our junkers are worth lol. But thats just some food for though. Users/Dozer
