20100531 18:08:16 nbsp I went to their Grand Opening and all I can say is FABULOUS! I am glad I found these girls again!
I have been going to Anamaria, Silvia and Mela for years now and now and I am so glad I can keep going to them.

This is the most friendly salon Ive been to in Davis, not pretentious, not full of hipsters, just a very welcoming atmosphere.  The girls are absolute angels, I feel very comfortable with them and they always do exactly what I asked them to do. They dont improvise on my cuts and Im so happy about that!  Ive had the worst luck with hair stylists so I am so happy that I found them again and I can keep going to them. Hopefully Ive found my mainstay salon in Davis, Ill update after my next appointment.

20100716 15:31:34 nbsp Alright, so this was my first real haircut meaning I wasnt just wanting a trim in Davis. I looked them up on Daviswiki and thought they had considerably good reviews so I went in no wait, very accommodating. The first thing I noticed: This is a primarily spanishspeaking organization. And theres nothing wrong with that. Except for the fact that I can hardly understand any of them through their accents and they talk most of the way through your hair cut.
My hair is pretty long and VERY thick. I have a hard time trusting people to put layers in my hair because I usually walk away looking like a 5 yearold cut it. I expressed this to Sylvia and she assured me that she was comfortable cutting long hair and there would be no problem. When it was all said and done, the back of my head looked great! Layers were awesome! However, the front, the part of me people see THE MOST looked like she literally chopped hair off and called it a layer. I told her that I would be embarrassed to go outside looking like that. She was super nice though and really tried to make it look more natural but it didnt work out. Guess Im just going to have to pin it back for a few months... / I give my experience a 4...  Users/kpgoertz

20100721 20:53:07 nbsp Anamaria, Sylvia and Mela have more than 14 years experience doing hair. They formerly were at Angies Beauty Salon. Anamaria has been doing my hair for more than 14 years. I always get what I ask for. My highlights always turn out the way I want. I get a lot of complements from everyone. I get ask all the time when will they open a salon in Sacramento. Yes, I go to Davis to do my hair. No else knows how to treat my hair like Anamaria. I highly recommend Expressions Hair design. You will be happy to pick any of the girls, all three are good.
This new place is very open and big. Lots of parking and you dont have to worry about getting a ticket. Users/atorres

20100722 10:01:49 nbsp I have been a client of Anamaria for five years now and followed her from Angies Beauty Salon to Expressions. In the past five years I have had many different cuts, styles, highlights, and colors. There is not a day that goes by that I do not recieve compliments on how beatiful my hair always looks. I would recommend Anamaria and Expressions Hair Design in Davis to everyone. Expressions Hair Design is the most friendly environment in the area and I enjoy going to the salon and visting with Anamaria, Sylvia and Mela. My time at the Salon is always relaxing and pleasant.

20100805 16:23:17 nbsp I wanted a change so I went in and got my hair cut short and highlighted peekaboo style (super cute). It was kind pricey but not to bad! They did a fantastic job I am very please! My stylist was super sweet and funny so it made the experience pleasent especally because I was so nervouse about cutting my hair short but she baby stepped me throught the whole thing and I got a great cut. I was worried when I first went in because I read in one of the reviews that they had thick accents and I worried that I would have a hard time understanding them. Well I tied them out anyway and I have to say they speak  good English and their accents were not bad at all. Anywho I had a good experience and  Im super glad I went in! Oh yeah and my stylist was anamaria  : )     Users/JackieRodriguez

20101107 15:47:40 nbsp Expressions Hair Design is Wonderful! The salon donated a gift bag to be raffled off in support of my sororitys (Sigma Pi Alpha) philanthropy. The gift bag came with a free haircut, hair products, fashion jewelry, and a really pretty scarf. Its always great when local businesses give back to the community. Weve started referring friends to this salon and will continue to do so! Thank you Expressions for all your support!  Users/HeatherRodriguez

20120208 12:17:24 nbsp This place was recomended to me by a friend. It was as a little hidden. I looked it up on line before I went.... I was looking for a bright red buliding. Turns out the building color has changed (its gray).
My kids and I got a great cut at a resonable price. The place was nice and clean which is always nice.  Users/AndrewBelding

20120925 20:05:42 nbsp LOVE this place! came here for the first time today and had Mela as my stylist and she was great. i was nervous because i had never been and i was taking 6+ inches off my hair, but i gave her a picture of what i wanted and she cut it perfectly. she took the extra time to make sure that my new layers flowed well with the other colors in my hair so that it wouldnt look blocky and choppy. and you cant beat a 17 dollar price tag. will definitely be going here from now on! Users/Tay

20130112 15:51:16 nbsp I just got my hair cut by Silvia and she did an AMAZING job. I have boyshort hair and its easy for people to mess it up. I was pleasantly surprised to not only get a beautiful cut, but at $20 including shampoo/conditioning and a blow dry style. I was in and out in 25 minutes. I recommend Silvia to anyone! Users/SadieHutchison

20130710 16:54:26 nbsp I have been going to Silvia and Annamaria for the past 15 years or so since I moved to Davis (they were originally with Angies), other than a couple of emergency haircuts (regretting both of them).  I normally have Silvia cut and highlight my hair, but Annamaria did it equally as good today since Silvia was not there.  And she even remembered my name :)  I havent had the other ladies cut my hair, but everyone that I have seen sitting in their chairs appear very happy with their outcome.  Everyone there is always friendly and upbeat, their place is clean, bright and cheerful, and I have never received a bad haircut or highlight...ever.  They are also very reasonably priced.  I REALLY recommend this place. Users/mjbain
