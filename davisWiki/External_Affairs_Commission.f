The External Affairs Commission (EAC) is one of the seven commissions that advise the ASUCD Senate.  They serve the Association and the greater Davis Community by establishing and/or maintaining relations with the Universitys administration and also offcampus bodies affecting student welfare.


 The Commission 

The ASUCD Constitution of 1996 establishes and gives the commission its organic responsibilities:
 ...establishing liaison and achieving rapport with all offcampus, public bodies affecting students and their welfare in the University; (and) to work with the Executive Branch and Senate in developing and recommending policies for action in external areas.
Though the Constitution and Bylaws state EAC as only responsible for offcampus bodies, Vice Presidents Hooper and Fluet construed external to mean matters outside of the Associations structure; this interpretation places issues of university relations, withstanding academic affairs, under the jurisdiction of EAC.  In addition to its main duty to advise and recommend policies to the ASUCD Senate, the commission also:
 Hosts events such as Music on the Green in Central Park to promote good relations with the community
 Advocates and works with the advocacy units on issues pertaining to local and state governments on behalf of our memberstudents
 Sponsors local or state legislation pertinent to our constituents

__Commission Membership__
Consistent with Bylaws, the ASUCD Senate appoints to the commission nine voting members and up to four, but no less than two, alternate members at the discretion of the Chair of the Interviewing Committee.  Additional nonvoting, exofficio members sit on the commission, as follows: the ASUCD President President, the ASUCD Vice President Vice President, members of the ASUCD Senate, a designee from the ASUCD City/County Affairs Office Office of City and County Affairs; a designee from ASUCD University Affairs Office University Affairs; a designee from ASUCD Lobby Corps Lobby Corps; and a representative of the Graduate Student Association.  The schedule for selection causes members oneyear terms to stagger: the chair and four commissioners serve Fall terms ending on June 30th; four commissioner serve Winter terms ending on December 31st; and all alternate members serve terms ending with each academic quarter.

Voting commissioners may serve as an ancillary commission officer, rotating every academic quarter. Bylaws state the chair shall appoint from amongst the commission a Vice Chair, subject to the commissions confirmation.  In practice, past EAC Chairs observe a more democratic tradition: receiving nominations for the position and allowing the commission to vote.  Established under Chair Lee, the commission also maintains the post of the Commission Clerkresponsible for submitting and archiving the records for each meeting.  In the cases where no commissioner wishes to accept nomination as the Clerk, the Vice Chair assumes the vacated duties.

__EACs Current Work__
The commission holds its regular meetings on Tuesdays at 5:10 PM at the Mee Room,Memorial Union Memorial Union (3rd Floor) and are open to the public.  In Chair Sandstroms most recent quarterly report, she outlined the 2012 Spring and Fall plan for the commission, such as:
 Planning the Davis Volunteer and Service Fair
 Working with the City of Davis and Davis Flea Market to make Music on the Green a larger event
 Continue to have the commission participate in one community service project per quarter
 Coordinate deals and lengthen hours of businesses in downtown for Finals Week
 Improve Freshmen Welcome Week with better collaboration with Student Housing, Davis businesses, and ASUCD.
