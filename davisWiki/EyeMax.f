What is there to say? EyeMax is an wiki:WikiPedia:Optician optician. They changed their name from Optical Phases in the first couple weeks of 2010. They sell a wide selection of glasses, make custom eyeglass lenses, and they will even reRX your frames for you.  But they dont do eye exams.


I walked in, half blind, and they reassembled and adjusted my glasses for free. I was so happy I walked out without noticing much about them. Theyre clean and seem to have a reasonable selection of frames. The young lady who helped me was polite and competent. Users/JeffreyNonken

20051128 15:53:45 nbsp Top notch! Ive always had pleasure doing business here. They offer the last word in competitive pricing too. Users/ChrisRodgers

20060513 20:24:52 nbsp I broke my frameless glasses lens. I paid 65 to have them make a pair of lens. They drilled the hole unproportionately, one hole is drilled higher than another. I now have crooked glasses. Users/HaiYu

20060523 12:18:08 nbsp So, take them back and have them done right. Users/PaulThober

20070129 08:02:01 nbsp An arm of my glasses had broken and fallen off about 46 months ago and I thought that they were a complete goner because it snapped off at the metal part (instead of something easily fixable like a loose screw or a hinge).  But they were able to fix it.  It cost about $20 and it just broke off again!  Oh well, Ill be going back again because the price wasnt too bad and it was probably partially my fault for bad handling anyway. Users/DianeVo

20070607 11:47:22 nbsp Ive been going here for years and years. They are very friendly and can do custom work.  Users/LuisMolina

20071116 01:18:59 nbsp Friendly service; they fixed my glasses for free. :) Users/angelchen

20081007 12:01:57 nbsp These are the same cats who own Indivisual Eyes on 12th & K St. in downtown Sac. Stock varies at each location so ask if you dont see something youd like. Users/ChrisRodgers

20090228 14:36:30 nbsp I just got back from here about 15 minutes ago and I honestly dont know how anyone can find anything to complain about here.  My last pair of glasses broke last night so I came here. Unfortunately, they didnt carry the same frame, but the employee diligently searched for a similar pair, and after finding one, modified the shape of the lenses to match the frame and set the frame up all for a low cost of $57.  Ive been wearing glasses and dealing with opticians for over 7 years now, and this is by far the best place Ive come across. Users/avarshneya

20090829 22:08:26 nbsp Optical Phases has absolutely excellent service, great selection, and reasonable prices.  Ive been going there for years and have always been very happy with my experiences there.  Tip: they can shape the Silhouette glasses into just about any shape you want, really! Users/davisdebbie

20090912 21:01:29 nbsp Ive always had wonderful experiences here.  They got my new pair of glasses for me in record time and cheaper than other places in town.  More than that, Victor spent tons of time helping me find the frames and lens shape that fit my face.  Very accommodating and friendly!  Also, I dont know how this works on the Wiki, but theyve changed their name to Eye Max (might be one word, but Im not sure). Users/MonicaWilliams

20091114 15:27:31 nbsp My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. It was her first pair of glasses, and the staff were very helpful. Users/robvanacker

20100114 16:43:09 nbsp I went in there with loose and crooked glasses (after my face ran into a hand) today expecting to pay about twenty bucks for a fixup. The person there adjusted and cleaned my glasses for free. Very friendly service. Users/hankim

20100429 11:56:41 nbsp Nice looking place, but service was rushed and careless. I gave them a pair of glasses to straighten, and they were returned to me more crooked than before, one temple clearly bent out of whack and the opposite hinge loosened from where it´s riveted to the frame. I had ordered a new pair, and their estimate was way off! This is NOT a VSP member, so reimbursement is minimal (only $26 towards lenses and only $40 towards frames). I´d check around Davis to find someone else who is with VSP.  Users/rhodia

20100528 16:19:32 nbsp Great service! Users/strawberry

20120111 15:56:34 nbsp They are very nice! My glasses came loose today because I lost a screw, but they replaced it for no charge at all! Users/lmaoxlong
