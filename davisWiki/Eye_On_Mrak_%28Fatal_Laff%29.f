Eye On Mrak (Fatal Laff) is one of The Eggheads on campus.  It sits in front of Mrak Hall, and was placed there in 1994. The eye was originally placed to stare directly at the Chancellors office, but the Chancellor has since moved.

20050427 20:01:59 nbsp Leslie, my TA for AMS 21 (objects in every day life) maintains that the back side of the Eye on Mrak egghead was created by the artist to look like a wrinkly penis when viewed from the fourth floor of Mrak  apparently some sort of commentary on his feelings for the administration.  Im not sure if this is 100% true but Leslie claimed to have heard the rumor from a very reputable source.   Users/AynReyes
