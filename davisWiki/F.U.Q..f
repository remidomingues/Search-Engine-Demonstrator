F.U.Q. is a slate that has run candidates in two ASUCD Elections thus far. The acronym stands for Fed Up Queers and may have been borrowed from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Up_Queers the NYC activist group.

In the Winter 2013 ASUCD Election Miguel Espinoza Migz Espinoza and Lane Lewis ran for President and Vice President respectively as the F.U.Q. executive ticket. F.U.Q. did not run any Senate candidates and instead supported the SMART slate which ran candidates for Senate but not an executive ticket. SMART endorsed and campaigned with Espinoza and Lewis.

In the Winter 2011 ASUCD Election Miguel Espinoza Migz Espinoza and Caitlin Alday ran for Senate together as the F.U.Q. slate. Espinoza was elected to the Senate.

They seem pretty cool, but Id probably vote for Sergio Cano instead.  Still, Ill definitely give them an endorsementlike statement for my #2 vote (because Not NOW Slate NOW, not ever!). Users/BrentLaabs
