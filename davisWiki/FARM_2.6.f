## Announcements (also add to events!):










FARM 2.6 is a sister project to the K Street FARM, the Valdora Street FARM and the Hooper Street FARM, part of the FARM Davis FARM Davis network. FARM is an alternative form of nonviolent protest, reclaiming public space to build community, providing services for under served and transient populations and/or rehabilitating toxic land. FARM 2.6 aims to reimagine our food systems, the way we learn, the way we connect to each other, and the way we connect to the land.

FARM 2.6 is a 2.6 acre plot of land (hence the name) that we are transforming into a highly productive farms farm. At least 1/2 of the crop output is donated to lowincome and homeless resources. We eat the other half! Currently we are donating crops to the Cesar Chavez residence, where no income/low income and formerly homeless people have a safe place to stay and Davis Community Meals. We also have a natural dye and fiber garden.

We have 11 chickens chickens, a horse, 2 sheep, and 2 barn cats.
