About Farm Davis
FARM Davis is an alternative form of civic action, building community through sustainable farming of public and private space, assisting lowincome and homeless populations, and integrating local and real food into mainstream culture and education.

We have 3 plots of land that we are transforming into a highly productive farms farm. At least 1/2 of the crop output is donated to lowincome and homeless resources. We share the remaining portion! Currently we are donating crops to the Cesar Chavez Plaza, where no income/low income and formerly homeless people have a safe place to stay and to Davis Community Meals. If you need seeds for your garden, let us know! We would like you to use the seeds to feed yourself and if you can, to donate half your harvest to someone who needs fresh food. Then save your seeds and give them away to someone else.

We have planned work days that are posted at the top of this page. Feel free to join us whenever you canâ€“ no firm commitment ever required.

We have chickens chickens, Sheep, and a horse! See our coop building diagram and progress photos below.
