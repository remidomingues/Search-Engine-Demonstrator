Power Vinyasa Yoga, a practice rooted in Ashtanga, is an athletic yoga practice that links breath with movement. In Power Vinyasa Yoga, practitioners flow from yoga pose to yoga pose on breath, building strength, flexibility, and stamina. FIT House Power Vinyasa Flow Yoga classes are 75 minutes in length.

 Types of Classes 

Power Vinyasa Yoga: Power Vinyasa Yoga is a combination of deep breathing and specifically sequenced sets of flowing yoga postures. It has the ability to build strength, increase endurance, release tension, and create more flexibility in the entire body. And it’s a calorie burner  an average 140 pound person will burn 450 calories in a 60 minute session.

Yin Yoga: Yin Yoga is designed to leave you feeling relaxed, stretched and energized.Yin yoga holds postures for 3 to 5 minutes and is done in a cool room… the polar opposite of a hot Vinyasa class. Yin yoga works with your connective tissues and fascia and uses time, gravity and your own body weight to facilitate a deep stretch and maximize the effects of each posture.

 FIT House also holds workshops throughout each month, please visit our website to see upcoming events and workshops.

Tips and Etiquette for New Students
  Take good care. Take water when you need it. Take child’s pose when you need to rest or reconnect with your breathing.
  Take your shoes off. Yoga is done in bare feet.
  Bring a mat, a towel, and water to class. An appropriate yoga mat is important to keep you safe and comfortable during your practice. This practice is a very physical practice with a cardiovascular component. You will likely sweat and need to be hydrated.
  Show up early. The class may tend to fill up quickly. Allow yourself time to settle in on your mat before class begins.
  The room is warm. The room is heated and kept warm, approximately 87 degrees. Heat helps warm up your muscles for your safety and it helps build equanimity.
  Clothing. Wear clothing that is comfortable and allows freedom of movement.
  Allow yourself to have fun and try something new.

If you live in Davis and have been driving into Sacramento for this flavor of yoga, check out yoga at The Fit House.  As of today, they are offering 7 classes (MondaySaturday, see web site/Facebook) and will offer more as demand increses.  Rob Kane Users/RobKane

20130114 14:23:44 nbsp I have only attended a few classes here, but so far I am hooked! The Vinyassa classes are very athletic and challenging, but in a very approachable and inspiring way The instructors are wonderful, the other practitioners are warm, and overall this studio is so welcoming. I highly recommend this studio, and I wanted to say thank you to the staff for awesome student rates! Users/kelseycee

20130426 13:43:12 nbsp My wife has been an avid Fit House junkie for the past two years and I finally was ready to give it a try.  I signed up for their 10 days of Yoga classes for 10 dollars.  I have zero yoga experience and while a bit intimidated I can say that all three instructors I have had so far have been incredibly encouraging and I have really been enjoying these classes.  Very impressed with the instructors and the I appreciate that the facility is not a fishbowl and feels very private.  I never expected to enjoy yoga so much for both the mental and physical challenges and benefits I have realized from these classes and I will definitely be coming here regularly from this point forward.
