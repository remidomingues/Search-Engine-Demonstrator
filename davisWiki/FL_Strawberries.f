FL Strawberries is probably the closest small fruit and vegetable stands fruit and vegetable stand to Davis.  The best way to find it is to head west on West Covell Boulevard out of Davis and look for the little white stand on the left.  As their name suggests, strawberries are their main product, but they often sell other fruits and vegetables as well (cantaloupes and squashes have been spotted there, for example).  Their strawberries are exceptionally sweet and yummy, often having been in the fields next to the stand only minutes before youve purchased them.  The berries are $2 for a basket, $7.50 for 4 baskets, or $10 for six baskets.  Look for their sandwich board on Covell near the city border as an indicator of whether theyre open or not.

April 2013: They are open for the season!

20100513 16:43:14 nbsp I love these strawberries.  With all due respect to the fine vendors who come to the Farmers Market, these are always sweeter and more flavorful.  They will spoil you so that you no longer want to eat other strawberries. Users/CovertProfessor

20100528 09:57:47 nbsp I brought cherries last week and they were heavenly! The best thing is Im allergic to a lot of cherries (prickly mouth, slight swelling), er I do still love cherries  but I didnt have much reaction eating cherries from this stand.
However, they spoil very quickly (mold coming out the next day) but that only indicated to me that theyre picked fresh and ripe, and no preservatives/coatings. Eat them immediately after you brought those. Users/LeeY

20100722 04:55:30 nbsp Just a tip... these berries are delicious and beautiful but like the best of fruit, they are so tasty because they are THAT close to rotting overripeness (in the most wonderful way imaginable!) Buy only what you need, but buy often. They only keep for a few days after buying, even if refrigerated. Users/KBathory
  If you cannot finish them all, make jam: 2 cups quartered berries, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice.   Mix in large glass bowl (5 or 6 cup) and microwave on high for 1015 minutes.  This makes about 6 to 8 oz.  Store in a covered jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Users/SueHjerpe
