Focus on Student LEADership (FOSL) is the brainchild of XKai SavareeRuess Mr. KaiX, Users/KyleFlick Mustafa, and Users/PaulHarms PMoney. They are currently recruiting commission chairs, commissioners, and interim directors of anything for their tres cool slate. FOSL is going end partisanship in ASUCD, and will promote values concurrent with SF and LEAD, etc.  Maybe. Meh.

Slogan:
 WE DONT RUN FOR ASUCD. WE RUN ASUCD.

Platform Agenda:
  FOSL opposes stupid legislation and the stupid people who write stupid legislation.
  FOSL wishes to move all senate meetings to the Silo Pub and Cafe Silo Pub. This will make things much more interesting.
  FOSL will continue to fight to keep ASUCDs sense of humor alive.
  FOSL supports well researched legislation, and recommends that bill authors go to the library occasionally.

Elected officials are not allowed in this slate.

What is the plan to end partisanship without support of ASUCD Senate Senate members? Strictly keeping the commissions neutral? Users/JosephBleckman
  Were actually pretty damn good at getting support in one way or another from each and every Senator.  Call us a nonpartisan moderate coalition of appointed officials working with all senators.  Or call us a group of ASUCD insiders with a sense of humor.

20061204 00:54:43 nbsp Ive been considering your plan to move Senate meetings to the Silo Pub. It might be a good way to get more public voices in student gov. I guess the main issue could revolve around the costs of keeping the place open late, yet considering the lack of on campus food places after 8 (excluding the DCs) it could be worth a try. With at least 13 hungry Senate peeps down there, plus the normal potential campus crowd, that setup might be capable of turning a profit for them. Whats the latest on this plan? Users/JosephBleckman
