Similar to http://www.friendster.com/ Friendster.com, DavisCoeds DavisCoeds.com, and other social networking websites, http://ucdavis.facebook.com/ Facebook started up in February 2004. By the time students returned to UC Davis that September, the site was already part of the culture.  The name was originally The Facebook, but they changed their domain and logos to all read simply Facebook in the Fall of 2005.  As of September 29th, 2007 there are 38,918 people on the UC Davis Facebook network.  Facebook is commonly referred to as Stalkerbook, due to its many features that allows you to track people in your network, especially when you are friends with those people.

Facebook launched as a fouryear universityonly service initially, allowing only those with valid universityrelated email addresses to sign up.  This universityspecific email catch proved successful, and the site was able to undergo tremendous but controlled growth.  Progressively the Facebook began adding 2year colleges and community colleges.  In 2005 High Schoolers were allowed to sign up for the site, but because of concerns regarding polluting the collegespecific nature of the site they were not allowed to communicate or be seen by the college users.  On February 27, 2006 Facebook dropped this restriction, and High Schoolers and College Students can now interact.  On September 11, 2006 Facebook announced they would soon be opening up Facebook registration to anyone, not just College and High School students.  This change went through on September 26th, 2006, and now anyone can use the Facebook service.

On September 5, 2006 Facebook altered the default loggedin screen to be the News Feed, a new feature that lists every action that every Facebook friend of yours makes on Facebook.  The News Feed feature received http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/06/09/06/0112231.shtml widespread negative reactions from Facebook users, but initially http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post2208197130 Mark Zuckerberg stood by it and asked users to give it a chance.  Hundreds of groups opposing the change were formed, the largest of which reached well over 50,000 people within the day, and 750,000 members by the third.  On September 8, 2006, three days after the launch of the news feed, http://community.livejournal.com/ucdavis/3378908.html Zuckerberg apologized and said new privacy settings were being added to the News Feed.  Most notably, bits and pieces of personal information can be removed from the news feed (Publish stories when Iâ€¦), and some of the information such as relationship status changes and group joining are by default no longer included in the feed. However, many users are still not impressed with the whole feeds thing and the redesign that accompanied the feature. The privacy update killed the part of a persons profile where they could list the courses they were taking.


November of 2007 brought what is possibly their most grievous invasion of privacy yet!  With a fresh inflated valuation and associated investment from Microsoft, Facebook began to face pressures to increase their advertising effectiveness.  Their solution: Beacon Ads:  companies pay Facebook and when you take unrelated actions on these companies websites they send data, without your permission, to Facebook.  Facebook then displays this information for the world to see.  As an example, if you purchased a movie ticket from Fandango.com while logged into Facebook, youd have the purchase information forwarded to Facebook.  Some time during your check out on the unrelated site you would see a message about opting out of the news feed display.  Regardless of whether or not you agree to having the data displayed in the news feed, Facebook still retains your purchase data (lord knows what theyll do with it years down the line).  There is no global optout of the new social ads system  you can only optout of individual transactions being displayed on the news feed as they occur.  Opting out is often pretty hard, as http://civ.moveon.org/facebookprivacy/beacon_demo.html this demonstration from MoveOn shows.

The new Beacon Ads are possibly illegal in some states because they amount to endorsement of products and services without meaningful consent.  The group MoveOn is http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/moveontakesonfacebook/ protesting the Beacon Ads.


Some popular features include:

  Groups  These can be anything from housing to fraternities to common interests to official clubs. Includes a message board, officer list, profile, and groupies (people who are friends with several members of the group).  Global groups became available in July of 2006.
  Applications  additional programs that allow users to do a variety of things. Users can send free gifts, flowers that bloom, build a garden, build an aquarium, virtually throw things (food fight), or cast spells on each other (Harry Potter Magic Spells).  People can Graffiti walls, have a super wall, buy each other as pets (Human Pets), take care of pets using(fluff)Friends, or take quizzes depending on the application.
  Messages  This works like email. Send a message to a particular user or a group of people.
  Events  Hosts can use this function to invite people. RSVPs are included.
  Poking  Gets a persons attention without the bother of typing an actual message.

Negatives:


   Most schools are all about keeping their alumni in touch with one another and in touch with the university.  Hence, most schools give you a MailTo(user AT alumni.school DOT edu) account.  However, at Davis, you have to buy your way into the alumni association to get such an address. (Edit: Joining the alumni association at UC Davis does not give you your ucdavis.edu email address. They provide an email, but it is a yourname@ucdavisalumni.com email address.)  However even schools as humble as UC Riverside give complimentary alumni addresses.  I inquired about this once, and the UC Davis alumni association essentially replied that they really didnt care.  If Davis gave out alumni email addresses like every other toptier university (it appears) and many lower tier ones, even alumni could use The Facebook.  Users/JaimeRaba jr
   http://emailforwarding.ucdavis.edu/ WELCOME TO THE UC DAVIS EMAIL FORWARDING SERVICE!. If you are a UC Davis graduate, retiree, or have otherwise separated from the campus community, but wish to continue receiving email from your UC Davis email address, you may be eligible for an optional and complimentary service that will forward your MailTo(mailid AT ucdavis DOT edu) email to an external email address of your choice (e.g., user@yahoo.com).

   ASUCD Elections Popularity Contests  Welcome to high school. Some people can become Varsity Facebook Team semicrazed about adding as many people to their Friends as humanly possible in order to make themselves appear cooler to others.
   Students for an Orwellian Society Big Brother  Several other University town police forces regularly use Facebook as a resource to identify people in footage taken or seized at protests, riots and rowdy parties.
   Easier than ever to stalk people. A Sept 5th, 2006 update includes ministories on each persons page, which includes ridiculous amounts of info: adding or deleting info to the profile, new friends, joining or leaving groups, if they wrote on other peoples walls, etc.  Its basically a tiny little stalker info tool.
   You can unsubscribe from email notifications for group invites, friend requests, and event invitations through the My Account link in Facebook.

Facebook is developed in a combination of programing languages, but was originally primarily written in wiki:WikiPedia:PHP PHP.  The Facebook code base includes programs written in wiki:wikipedia:PHP PHP, wiki:wikipedia:C_programming_language C, wiki:wikipedia:C%2B%2B C++, wiki:wikipedia:Perl Perl, wiki:wikipedia:Python_programming_language python, wiki:wikipedia:Java_%28programming_language%29 Java, and wiki:wikipedia:ML_programming_language ML.

Some students have gone way overboard with their Facebook accounts and, if they have more than 500 Facebook friends, qualify for the Varsity Facebook Team

Facebook has been growing more and more crappy in terms of ads and such. Tired of sponsored stories? Tired of their stupid web search showing up when you dont want it to? Put this in your CSS file for the site (e.g. https://addons.mozilla.org/enUS/firefox/addon/2108 Stylish, if using Firefox) and make it all go away!
