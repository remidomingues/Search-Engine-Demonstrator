The faculty are the brains of UC Davis the University.  All of the faculty can teach classes, but some work solely in research or with the Cooperative Extension.  Faculty also includes those instructors without wiki:WikiPedia:Tenure tenure, but they are treated much differently than tenured and tenuretrack faculty, who also do research as part of their job.  Untenured tenuretrack faculty have a rank of Assistant Professor, while tenured faculty have a rank of Associate Professor or Professor.  However, the title Professor is usually used by most students to refer to those faculty who teach.  Some people believe that grad students are considered Junior Faculty.  This may just be apocryphal, but it describes the purpose of graduate school, which is to produce more professors, depending on the field.  Some professors are far more focused on their research than on teaching, which leads to UC Undergrad Neglect.  In general though, professors are approachable people who are very interesting to talk to  so interesting that they have produced the vast majority of quips on the Memorable Quotes page.

New faculty should head over to the http://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~billen/ucdnfn.html UCD New Faculty Network to find ways to meet up with other new faculty (e.g., monthly happy hours).

Associations:

  The Academic Senate is the association of tenured and untenured tenuretrack professors
  The Academic Federation is the union for nontenuretrack faculty (lecturers), as well as other academic personnel
 From the terminology used, tenuretrack professors clearly prefer wiki:WikiPedia:Galactic_Senate Star Wars to wiki:WikiPedia:United_Federation_of_Planets Star Trek.
  The http://www.ucdfa.org/ Davis Faculty Association (DFA) strives to protect faculty interests by monitoring and influencing decisions of the University Administration and the legislature in matters of salaries, benefits, and working conditions of the faculty.

20070507 11:09:13 nbsp I think that the stats and such should go on a subpage. Its enough to just state overall demographic trends and let the reader look at the actual numbers only if they want to. This would reduce clutter and improve readability. Maybe Ill get around to it if I decide to procrastinate on studying some more. Users/WilliamLewis
