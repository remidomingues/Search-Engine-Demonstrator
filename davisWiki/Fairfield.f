  If youre passing through and need somewhere to eat....

  Okhura  Japanese food. Rather pricey during dinner but have some very nice lunch combination for around $67. Located right by the gate into Travis Air Force Base. Make sure you lock your car, its not a really good area. Pizza Hut is also in this parking lot, as well as 3 bars and an Adult Superstore
  Baldos Mexican Food  1730 W. Texas St., just off 80. Authentic Mexican taqueria open 24hours, with a drivethrough or sitdown. $4  $9 depending on what you order. Run by the same people as the Baldos Mexican Food in Vacaville, but this location is nicer and in a better part of town than the one in Vacaville.
