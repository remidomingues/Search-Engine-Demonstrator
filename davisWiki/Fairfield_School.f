Located out in the Outskirts middle of nowhere, this is as close as Davis gets to the concept of a one room schoolhouse (two classrooms). To get there, follow Russell Blvd. out about five miles west of town. It serves about 60 students in grades K3. The sign out front states the school was established in 1866.

Fairfield School has received grants from the http://www.davisfood.coop/dccf.htm Davis Coop Community Fund to plant school gardens and a lavender field. Parents are encouraged (required?) to volunteer at the school while their children attend. Though the school is intended to serve children living in rural Davis, they will accept town children if there is space. The waiting list to place a townie child at Fairfield is rumored to be years long.






20070720 13:43:38 nbsp Fairfield is a wonderful school that has made a tremendous difference in my sons development.  Winning the lottery to get into Fairfield has truly been like winning the lottery to our family.  Family participation is required, so there are extra adults around for kids that need more oneonone and a whole field for a playground!  I reccommend getting into the lottery if you have a child entering kindergarten! Users/JacqueDenton
