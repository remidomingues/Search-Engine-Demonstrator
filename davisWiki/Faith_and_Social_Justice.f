Faith and Social Justice is a multidenominational, Biblebased community that seeks to integrate its faith, politics, and lifestyle by studying, discussing, and taking action on social justice issues both locally and abroad. The group meets regularly for lively discussions of Scripture and contemporary books.   Particpants believe they have been called to care for the earth and to reach out to all people with love, nonviolence, and justice.

During the school year, the group meets monthly (often the 3rd Friday of each month from 79pm) in peoples home.  Email Terry to be added to the groups distribution list and receive 23 emails per month with news, upcoming events, and summaries of past meetings.
