Vote distribution

This makes Greg Webb the most hated person on campus, which is surprising considering that just about everyone under the sun endorsed him. Then again, he made a lot of LEAD partisans angry towards the end with his attacks on the slate system and individuals pushing what he considered to be flawed policy.

Also,the range of #1 votes in this election was unusual, as the difference between most first place votes (Danny) and least first place votes (Joemar) is only 152.

Finally, just to prove once again that every vote counts, Greg Webb was eliminated in the 7th Round because he was behind Justin Patrizio by the equivalent of 7 first place votes. It is common in ASUCD elections for the final candidates to be decided by razor thin margins, such as Andrew Bianchis loss in the Winter 2006 ASUCD Election, Lauren Thomas in Fall 2007, Poonam Dayalji in Winter 2008, etc. In each of these races, the determination of who was the last candidate to be eliminated was less than 20.

 Election Summary 
Due to the dissolution of the GO slate and thus the absence of a slate/slate battle, there is considerably less drama in this fall election.  The election has featured some changes from elections of the past, with AGTV providing candidates the opportunity to shoot ads and a more debate structured forum style.  The latter brought about much discussion of the following issues:
  Outreach Assembly Keep it as is or strip its funding
  Resolutions Should ASUCD take stances on political issues
  Slates System  Good or Bad
  Budget Discretionary spending, shortfalls, fee increases

 COHO Debate 

The COHO debate was largely Webb vs LEAD, with Webb criticizing the point of funding the OA due to its vacancies and perceived uselessness.  He also alleged that LEAD has bad hiring practices, a claim quickly denounced at the next ASUSD Senate meeting.  Greg stands by the allegations because they originated from Amy Hartstein. Users/BrentLaabs Brent would like to point out that hes never seen an ASUCD Senate with good hiring practices.

LEAD candidates stated that the slate system does not make them a unitary thinktank and stated that they are all independent.  Despite this, there seemed to be little difference between the LEAD candidates on issues, the most notable may have been Jack Zwalds stance on changing UC Standards.  Jack Zwald boldly stated that he will not raise your student fees.

20081111 10:29:53 nbsp This will go down as the most boring ASUCD election in years.  Hands down.  (I know most of campus truly appreciates the lack of drama, though.) Users/PaulHarms

20081111 10:38:29 nbsp Im really surprised that GO/Student Focus just crumbled. Im more surprised that dwiki isnt ASUCDwiki before an election, for once. Users/WilliamLewis

20081111 11:49:16 nbsp Im really impressed with Jack Zwald, even though hes my opponent.  I think he gets it and hes pretty pragmatic with his approach to student government.  Hes not running on changing FDA regulations, he knows how hes going to pay for his ideas and hes informed of the job he seeks.  Hes definitely the best of the LEAD candidates so if youre voting LEAD vote Jack Zwald #1.

If youre voting for change...nobodys been taking on the status quo more than me.  But I would caution people to stay away from some of the lessseasoned candidates.  They made it pretty clear during the debate that they really havent looked at the budget or know much about ASUCD Senate.  Its not debilitating but its not always best to have a senator that cant get started because they have to figure thing out along the way.

I also think its funny that LEAD has come out in support of GOs infamous pizza money cuts.

But..those are just my views. Users/GregWebb

LEAD didnt come out against staff development, I said that we should look into where it is going and see if its a worthwhile cut. Nobody has come out in support, Ive simply put it on the table. Jack Zwald
  Whats your current opinion?  Greg
   My current opinion is that $99 a year is the bare minimum of compensation for nine people who volunteer over 60 hours of service to ASUCD, to then be completely ignored by the Senate.  Or is $0.18 an hour too much for the ASUCD Senate which repeatedly passes resolutions to support a living wage? Users/BrentLaabs
   My current view is that I have already drafted a plan that can cut $4,000 if we need to. Id not like to cut Staff Development, but Im not taking it off the table. Jack Zwald
