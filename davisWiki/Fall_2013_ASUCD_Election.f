The Fall 2013 ASUCD Election was held from Tuesday, November 12th to Friday, November 15th (8am to 8am) online at http://elections.ucdavis.edu.  There were 10 candidates competing for 6 seats on the ASUCD Senate.  NOW Slate NOW ran a full ticket with 6 candidates, SMART fielded 2, and 2 candidates ran as Independent Independents.  While not as bad as Fall 2011 ASUCD Election some elections, 10 candidates made this race the fourthleast competitive since ASUCD transitioned to Choice Voting in Fall 2003.

Voter turnout was 14.29%, the lowest its been since Fall 2011 ASUCD Election.

 The California Aggie Aggie Endorsements 
http://www.theaggie.org/2013/11/07/senateendorsementsconsiderthefollowing/ The California Aggie has endorsed:
  1.  Maria Watson (SMART)
  2.  Gareth Smythe (I)
  3.  Janesh Gupta (NOW)
  4.  Hiba Saeed (SMART)

As seen in some previous elections, the Aggie decided to not give a full endorsement of six candidates as it normally would.  Taken from the endorsement article, The Aggie believes that many of the remaining candidates are running on unrealistic platforms, most of which surmise to lobbying facets of campus that ASUCD has no control over. We feel that Senate is not the proper medium to make realistic reform in these organizations, and that these six seats should be filled with students whose expectations align with what ASUCD can actually deliver.

20131121 23:29:03 nbsp Someone should let the current ASUCD Elections Chair know that he was wrong when he said Voter turnout is directly correlated to the number of candidates to http://www.theaggie.org/2013/11/21/thisweekinsenate7/ The Aggie. If you look at all of the Fall Elections from 2003 to 2013 the two highest turnout elections had 13 and 14 candidates, the two lowest turnout elections had 13 and 16 candidates. If you remove those four elections (even though there is no justifiable reason to do so), there actually was an increase in turnout when the number of candidates increased... until this election, which had higher turnout with fewer candidates. The Winter Elections paint a similar picture where you have to throw out half of the elections as outliers to get a direct correlation between voter turnout and number of candidates. Its speculation on my part but I think it has more to do with who is running than how many people are running. For instance, a popular candidate who can bring in people who wouldnt normally vote will have more of an impact on voter turnout than 3 candidates fighting for votes from the same base of supporters.

Also, its still absurd that the Elections Committee is held responsible for voter turnout. At best the Elections Committee can tell people there is an election happening but no significant number of people are going to vote because they were persuaded by the Elections Committee. Its not Freddie Oakleys job to convince you to vote, just to let you know when, where and how to vote. Users/JonathonLeathers

20131121 23:49:20 nbsp Im with ☝︎.  Its the job of the Elections Committee to let people know that an election is taking place.  Its always been the jobs of candidates to draw promote turnout of their own voters (and possibly suppress turnout for their opponents).  Candidate quality is a driver of these turnout.

But Jon, can we get a plot of turnout vs. candidate pool?  Id be surprised if there wasnt some kind of correlation, if not a strong one.  Id hypothesize you could explain maybe 2040% of the variability by candidate pool size. Users/BrentLaabs

20131124 01:17:42 nbsp Brent, the data comparing turnout and number of candidates can be found here: http://www.jtleathers.com/asucd/voterturnout.html. I never bothered to compare the two very closely because I didnt see enough correlation to think the number of candidates would ever be an accurate predictor of turnout.  Users/JonathonLeathers
