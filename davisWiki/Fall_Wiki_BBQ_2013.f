Describe Fall OMGLOLWIKIBBQ Wiki BBQ 2013 here. It appears to be a litmus test for a hypothetical bbq. Discuss below


Hi wikizens. Daubert Dfunk here just thinking that is has been quite some time since we all got down in BBQ town and as such we are long overdue for another one

Ideally a couple weeks out would be good? Before it gets too cold / rainy? End of October or something? Everyone is gone and we should just wait till Spring when JayDubs will be around?

anyone? Anyone??

## Or not :(

20131002 22:55:57 nbsp Ill go.  Maybe not the weekend of Oct 1213, as thats the neighbors night out when lots of people are already going to block parties all over town. Users/gcoville

20131003 19:16:37 nbsp Sure, why not?  Users/chandru

20131003 19:36:55 nbsp I would come I guess when the BBQ would be vegetarian and vegan. But I guess this will be outvoted. I will not come when theres fish, meat, poultry or arthropods (locusts etc.) involved.  Users/ConstantiaOomen
