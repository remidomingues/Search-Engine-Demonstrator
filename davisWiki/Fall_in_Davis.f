What happens during the Fall in Davis? What does Davis look like during the Fall?


 Weather 

During the Fall, Davis can stay hot into late September and early October, but usually it begins to cool down into the 70s and 80s. Strong northerly winds also race through Davis kicking up a lot of dust, knocking down branches and making it hard for Bicycling bicyclists. Davis can, but usually does not get too much rain in the Fall. The middle and late parts of Fall continue to get colder (60s, 50s), but usually remain dry through through the start of Winter.
