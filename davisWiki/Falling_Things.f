September 2011  A Tree Falls in Davis




In September 2011, a (possibly overwatered?) pine tree came down onto Lake Boulevard near Russell Boulevard.  The tree fell across a totally defenseless and unaware parked and covered Motorcycles motorcycle or scooter and blocked Lake.  A Davis Police Department Davis Police officer was seen to be swinging a hatchet at it Summer in 100Â° heat, clearing the top branches enough for traffic to pass by, and remarked to a Users/BruceHansen passerby that he wasnt having fun.  The sprinklers were still going by the base of the tree and there was a pool of water under the uprooted pine tree. Shortly thereafter, the fire department arrived with chainsaws.
