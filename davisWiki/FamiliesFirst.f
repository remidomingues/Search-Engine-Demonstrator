EMQ FamiliesFirst is a local NonProfit Organizations nonprofit social service organization dedicated to bettering the lives of children and families through a variety of programs tailored to each individual.  Job seekers are encouraged to apply due to high turnover.  A variety of positions are available for individuals with high school diplomas, bachelors, and masters degrees. Like most nonprofits, wages are low unless you have a masters degree. Fulltime workers receive paid sick and vacation leave, medical, dental, and vision insurance, 401k match, life insurance, and a training stipend of $1800 a year.

On June 13th, 2013, the California Department of Social Services announced that they had http://www.modbee.com/2013/06/13/2761443/staterevokeslicenseofemqfamiliesfirst.html revoked FamiliesFirsts license to operate the Davis group home.  The move was likely connected to several recent issues at the location, including ongoing investigations into http://www.kcra.com/news/morechargespossibleinfamiliesfirstrapecase//11797728/20544736//51p69p//index.html several cases of assault and rape.  The formerly boys only facility became coed in recent years.  CEO Darrell Evora said two days later that he would http://www.sacbee.com/2013/06/15/5498663/davisgrouphomeownervowsto.html fight to stay open.
