Family Dollar is not a Dollar Stores dollar store, but a small box retail store competing with stores like Target on price. This is the first store of the nationwide chain to open in Northern California, beating their planned West Sac location due to Davis faster bureaucracy. They plan to open more stores in this region soon.

The first 50 customers received $5 gift cards at the grand opening on Saturday, October 12, 2013.
