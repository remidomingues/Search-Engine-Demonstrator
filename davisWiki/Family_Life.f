We had a complaint at the farmers market today that the wiki is heavily slanted toward the college/singles perspective and is severely lacking when it comes to family perspective.  I think thats very accurate.  At the moment, this is a placeholder/brainstorming session for what should inevitably become an extremely broad topic.  It is definitely accurate, but the best response to complaints like that might be to encourage those people to edit the wiki and bring their perspective!

This page is intended to function as a resource for families in Davis.  It will undoubtedly branch off into other pages, but Im starting off with a little brainstorming for what all needs to show up.  I hope it is something that can wind up on the Explore pane of the Front Page, although it obviously needs a lot of work.

  Parenting
  Family Activities
   Possibly broken down by ages
   Parks (page already exists, but we could certainly present it from a family perspective)
   Pools
   Bowling etc.
   Outoftown activities (Dave & Busters in Roseville, Laser Tag in Vacaville, Scandia, etc.)
   Kids sports leagues AYSO, Little League
   Rainy Day Activities
   Good Places to Take Kids
   Outdoor Activities
  Kidfriendly restaurants (as much as I like dogs, it seems really surprising that we have a list of dogfriendly places, but not kidfriendly)
  Child Care
  Schools (obviously already exists)
   Tutors etc. (already exists)
  Special Needs services
  Divorce
