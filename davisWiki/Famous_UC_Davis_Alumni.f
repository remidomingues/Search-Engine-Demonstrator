UC Davis has turned out several famous alumni over the years.


## Try to keep the list alphabetic (by last name)
## Try to keep the primary link (the name) an internal link to encourage Davis specific entries for these people.  Website and Wikipedia links can go afterwards (and should really be on that persons entry, not here).
