Fan Yang is a Davisites Davisite who, when she was a teenager, http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/science/story/13392634p14234090c.html discovered a chemical compound that stops bacteria from attaching to contact lenses, reducing the possibility of eye infections.

She won second place in the biochemistry category of Intels International Science and Engineering Fair and the 2005 grand prize at the http://www.srsefair.org/ Sacramento Regional Science and Engineering Fair. She will attend http://www.jhu.edu/ John Hopkins University.

She came up with the need for such a chemical when she was told by her eye doctor that contact lenses carry the risk of eye infection.

Her mother works as a lab technician at UC Davis
