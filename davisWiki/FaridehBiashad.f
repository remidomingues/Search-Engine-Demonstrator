Describe Users/FaridehBiashad here.

Hello Farideh, I understand why you are editing your Fara (Threading and Hair) business page, all of us business owners start out the same way. But this is not really a page owned by you, and the collective editors (of which you are one!) dont really like to see history deleted. The wiki is not really a business site, but more of a town history site. Some pages you might want to check out are the Introduction and Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Welcome to the Wiki  Business Owner. And welcome from me as well! I love to see more salon pages being fleshed out.Davidlm
