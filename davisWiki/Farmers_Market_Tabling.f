Currently, no one is tabling for the Wiki.  If youre interested in representing, find out who currently has the tabling /equipment equipment, pick it up, and make it happen!

The Wiki had a table at the Farmers Market for most of the summer.  You can learn more about LocalWiki Announcement Local Wiki and the Summer 2010 pledge drive, as well as the Wiki Pledge Drive 2010/Events Events that were held.  Weve got a canopy, a table, some chairs, and a nifty banner.  Some work was done on /flyer flyers, which are still available.

What do we need?

  People to actually come out and table!
  Laptops! Do you have a laptop with reasonable battery life you could come & help us with?
   If the laptop has a bad battery, a long extension cord could provide what we need.

Can you help? Leave a comment!

Flyers are at Wiki Pledge Drive 2010/Flyers  print some out & hand them out!
Also add to Wiki Community/Outreach and Wikivangelists.
Plan more specifically to the campaign at Pledge drive planning.

 Money 
While wed prefer people to use Kickstarter to make their donations, some people insist on giving us cash. Do we want to put these donations into Kickstarter somehow (create a Davis Farmers Market donations account) or simply deposit them in the Wiki Spot bank account?

Also, there is the problem of not appearing to be shadiness factor shady. We must have a proper container to store the money rather than just pocketing it. We used a glass jar, and it helped. Two people should count the money at the end and post the total to the wiki to be sure none of it disappears. It has been suggested that we give receipts for cash donations, but is it really worth it when the average donation is $12?

For minimal shadiness, how about keeping a cash donation log on a clipboard? Sounds good!

20100625 16:09:52 nbsp Im in.  Ive got a very small (3x3 I think) table and two chairs that I can bring.  The hinge on my laptop is in the process of dying a quick but painful death, though, so I dont think itll make it out there. Users/TomGarberson

20100625 16:25:22 nbsp If at all possible, please collect donations via http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/455852114/localwikibringcollaborativelocalmediatoevery Kickstarter instead of cash/check.  Its more accountable, involves less administrative overhead, and has a much greater impact than cash/check donations. Users/Graham.Freeman
 I just want a cash box so if people insist on donating right then and there, I have a place to put the money instead of just pocketing it. Users/WilliamLewis
  Youre the one doing the tabling work, so your call, but Id suggest not accepting cash/check donations at all.  If it were me, Id politely decline any such offers and instead point them to the DavisWiki/LocalWiki site to donate.  Graham

20100625 16:37:52 nbsp How is your laptop battery?  There are some plugs there but you may need extension cord Users/PhilipNeustrom
 My battery is pretty much dead. Oy. wl

20100625 16:53:17 nbsp WL: for the flyer, I would suggest highlighting daviswiki a bit more.  Throw the logo on there or something, since thats what davisites tend to relate to. Users/TomGarberson

 Exactly, it needs to be shorter and more relevant to Davis.  I can help with this tonight. Users/MikeIvanov MikeIvanov
  Agree with this.  The new software in particular will benefit Davisites and make it easier to get more members of the community involved.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100625 16:57:37 nbsp Also, as a general rule, people are going to be leery of things involving money and a totally random URL.  IMO send them to LocalWiki first (or, better yet, daviswiki.org/donate or something like that), and use a link there to the kick.st page. Users/TomGarberson

   Better yet, tell them to go to http://daviswiki.org and click the giant pledge link at the top of the screen :)   Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Yeah!  What he said! tg

20100626 12:58:26 nbsp $25.88 in cash collected. Counted by me and Tom garberson.  Users/WilliamLewis

20100626 13:29:40 nbsp Tabling went well today!  Things we need for next time:
  A canopy.  Full sun in the summer is hot!
  A nice sign.  We made do just fine with one that William printed out, but a handmade one or a quality printed one would be a big improvement.
  A more formal looking donation box.  A number of people wanted to donate, but werent interested in going online to do it.  As William noted, we got over $25 in cash, but itd probably look a little less panhandley if the money wasnt sitting in a clear glass jar.
  For the next week and a half, a table and chairs.  I wont be able to make it. Users/TomGarberson

20100626 19:43:23 nbsp Theres no wifi reception at the park, apparently.  Does anyone out there have a cellphonetethering setup (or a mifi)? Users/PhilipNeustrom
 Even if you dont have a tethering setup, a laptop or two just to play back the video would be helpful! WilliamLewis

20100627 16:59:36 nbsp I might be down to help.  If I come, should I try to bring Bike Forths popup canopy?   Users/Angel.York
 If it keeps the sun off people, I say thats a good thing. ) Users/WilliamLewis

  Ok.  Ill do that if Bike Forth isnt using it.  Maybe Ill table for Bike Forth (and daviswiki/localwiki) and we can share the tent!  That would be fun. Users/Angel.York
   The farmers market people might want Bike Fourth to register. Mmmm silly regulations. Users/WilliamLewis



  Ditto the Bike Forth + Wiki tabling; the canopy sounds like a good idea.  Ive got a laptop with a fairly good battery and a cellphone that can do tethering.  Users/DarinWick
   That would be great! wl
    At market with canopy, etc. No sign or table. Will be here until done shopping.  Users/DarinWick

20100628 18:36:25 nbsp Word has it that the wiki shark sign thing is at J Street Coop.  Anyone able to swing by and see if its around? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100628 19:20:05 nbsp Anybody interested in approaching Screaming Squeegie, Ink Monkey or somebody to do a nice vinyl sign for Davis Wiki with their logo in the corner saying Sign donated by...?  If we are tabling regularly, its winwin. (Verify its okay with the Market, but its very common) Users/JabberWokky
  Once theres a finalized design, Id be happy to. Users/TomGarberson
   Tom, grab the .pdf from Wiki Logo and go for it. Users/JasonAller
    Sounds good.  Im assuming we wont have anything before Saturday, but Ill try and get some info tomorrow. tg

20100628 19:47:29 nbsp As a potential alternative to a laptop battery (or, more likely, to supplement it), if anybody has a jump starter or is interested in getting one, a decent Black and Decker jump starter has standard outlets and laptops can plug into it.  The capacity varies wildly depending on the brand and model, but its basically a bucket of electricity you can put under the table. Users/JabberWokky

20100628 20:34:48 nbsp I wish Davis Wiki had a designated gogo dancer for the tabling.  Wed make so much more money that way. Users/ScottMeehleib
  Im glad you volunteered!  Ill build the ministage :) Users/TomGarberson
   Make sure you build a wraparound curtain as well.  As people will likely pay more not to see my bare flesh.  Users/ScottMeehleib
    Hmm... when it comes to nakedScott, I wonder where the Officer Neves would draw the line between good marketing and terrorist threats... maybe Ill add a stripper pole! tg
   Ive been meaning to talk about this, but were actually in talks to have Crying Girl do our fundraising for us!  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Charge $5 per piece of fruit people want to throw at her?  The farmers market merchants will love it, too... theyll all sell out in no time! tg

20100629 20:19:05 nbsp Can anyone table on wednesday? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  I generally cant do Wednesdays.  Ill likely be out there most Saturdays. tg

20100701 06:57:25 nbsp Howd it go last night?  Did people actually make it out to table? Users/TomGarberson

        Yes, but me and Darin thought a daviswiki regular was going to turn up with a sign and table.  Guess next time we should plan on being selfsupporting?  Users/Angel.York

           There was an unfortunate snafu William thought hed be out there on Wednesday but ended up having to do a radio interview.   I would just make sure and check this page (at the top) to see if someones signed up to be there before heading out.  Or just go it alone :) Users/PhilipNeustrom

           That signup list is a great idea!  Users/Angel.York

20100702 08:57:00 nbsp I am free on Saturday morning.  I probably cant be there until 10:30 (because I sleep in on weekends) but if that is not too late I can commit to coming.  I will need to be given a run down of what kickstarter is and why we need $20,000 and all that. Users/DagonJones
 Great! Do you have access to a table and canopy? Users/WilliamLewis

20100702 10:22:48 nbsp I have no table or canopy, sorry.  I forgot about this, If someone has an umbrella that might help, otherwise I cant sit in the sun it just kills me. Users/DagonJones

20100714 15:33:52 nbsp Awesome sign!

We really need to get out there on Saturday!

How much are simple tables?  Can someone research how much a canopy is, too?  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Costco sells decently sized folding tables for about forty dollars. Here is a cheap canopy with decent reviews: http://www.walmart.com/ip/OzarkTrail9x9DiningCanopy/10993394 Users/hankim
  http://www.walmart.com/ip/OzarkTrail5CenterFoldingTable/14119034  $35 for a 5 folding table.  Wed want a 6, though, ideally.  The banner is 6 in length, and just has a few inches of blank space at each end.  Ones that fold in the middle like the one linked are really nice for easy transportation.
  6 one that folds in the middle from Ace for $60: http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId3077133&CAWELAID219050442

    Okay, I think we can spend around $80 on this (up to $100, lets say) from our currently veryminimal funds  and I think its definitely worth it.  William, can you coordinate purchasing this stuff?  Can you scan the receipts?  We can mail check to you just need receipts scanned.   Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Yeah. As long as I can get the check in about a week or two, I can buy this stuff and send you the receipts. A canopy and a foldy table?  Users/WilliamLewis
       Yes, I can get you a check in a week or two.  Just send me scanned receipts as soon as you can after purchasing them. Users/PhilipNeustrom
       It wont be bikeable, but a 6 one (preferably one that folds in half) will work a lot better with the 6 banner.  I suppose we could make a PVC frame for the banner and just tie it to the table or something, but then thatll present a biking challenge all its own. tg

20100716 18:25:49 nbsp I had hoped to show up tomorrow, but Im not going to make it :(  Someone keep William company! Users/TomGarberson

20100717 14:32:55 nbsp So our second farmers market tabling went awesomely! In addition to myself, Users/KBathory and Users/NickSchmalenberger came out and promoted Davis Wiki and Local Wiki. We got $5 in donations this time, but I convinced a lot of people to hang on to their cash and donate online. We had the local wiki video running on KBathorys laptop, running off of an extension cord. We had a canopy this time around, which made things much more bearable than before. We finally got to unfurl our awesome new sign, courtesy of Ink Monkey Graphics.

We had several people from out of town tell us about how they wish they had decent wikis. I directed them to localwiki.org and told them to submit their communities for consideration. We also had people who run events/organizations like the Davis Film Festival ask about how they could improve the pages for their events/organizations. I told them about how our new software is going to make things easier. Users/WilliamLewis

20100718 07:50:13 nbsp Good times. Ill see about my work schedule for this coming week. I should know by tonight (and each sunday night following) if Im able to table. I have a car, laptop, and cord. I can also see about making some sort of shnazzy sign with my poster board and sharpie skills, but thats about the extent of my ability. Users/KBathory

20100719 16:40:00 nbsp It might make sense to ask the Enterprise to put an announcement about the tabling under their Briefly columns.  I dont know if they charge for those announcements, but Ive seen similar announcements about other groups with tables at the Farmers Market.  It might help to draw attention to the table and to the cause in general. Users/CovertProfessor

20100724 18:05:23 nbsp Another wonderful day at the farmers market! We had plenty of outoftowners interested in the LocalWiki project... and by outoftowners, I mean like people from Boulder and Boston. We also had quite a few business owners stop by and thank us for all the referrals. One business owner said 50% of her new customers found her through the wiki! We were also approached by many people wondering how they could put stuff about their activities on the wiki.

On the donations front, we got $20 in cash (some guy just gave us a 20). Lots of people said theyd donate... we even gave away a button on the condition that the recipient donate. We really need to have a laptop there with internet so people can donate online there, which might happen next week (I potentially have a cellular modem).

Total cash donations from all three tabling sessions total $50.88.  Users/WilliamLewis

20100725 12:47:29 nbsp This maybe offtopic but I dont know where else to put it. Is there a centralized page for discussion of the LocalWiki fundraising?

Kurt Vaughn and I are interested in organizing a pair of fundraiser dance parties for LocalWiki, one at the Domes and one potentially at DoV. Is anyone interested in this? Email me at dch miller at uc davis dot edu, we can plot further with a replyall email thread. Users/Darach

20100726 04:42:19 nbsp Ill have to remember to bring my laptop from now on. Its a bit troublesome that my screen doesnt go brighter than it does but its passable. Ill check out my work schedule as usual. Users/KBathory

20100728 09:47:41 nbsp I will be out of town this Saturday. If anyone is going to table, comment here and Ill get you the canopy and table. Users/WilliamLewis

20100810 22:43:30 nbsp Covert Professor is right.  SN&R would also get a lot of attention, and Im pretty sure they accept articles if someone writes one.

In other news, I can table for part of Saturday market later in the day if someone brings tabling stuff. Users/Angel.York

20100811 01:46:34 nbsp I can help table tomorrow (today).  Anyone else down? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100822 03:54:23 nbsp I can help out for any amount of time on Wednesday the 25th and my laptop has excellent battery life. Who do I contact to work this all out and do we need anything else that I might be able to bring? Users/RachelPeters

20100826 02:30:15 nbsp So it turns out we do have wifi, or at least I did where I was (the very last stall space still under the permanent canopy thing). There were two instaconnect signals and instaconnect allows hotspot use for free as long as you hand over your personal info (name, address, and email). So I got to let people browse our wiki on my laptop and showed the kickstarter page. Many didnt seem to be too interested in donating but a great deal were interested in the fundraiser events so I concentrated on pushing those (will those proceeds go to the kickstarter site?). Ill be there next Wednesday as well. Users/RachelPeters

   The proceeds from the auction & sophias night will go into the kickstarter totals, though we may have to hand off the money to someone and have them pledge that amount (due to annoyances involving the amazon payment system).  At least for the auction, one plan was to have people commit, on paper, to the item  and then wed follow up with them via email/phone to ensure theyd made the pledge online  I think this is how most auctions work, so its not too big a difference.

   Thanks for being out there today!!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100827 17:06:34 nbsp Is anyone available to table tomorrow? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100901 15:02:40 nbsp So Ill be out tabling again today from 4 pm  8:30 or so. Someone save me a Wiki sticker, as I wont be able to get to Sophias till 9! Users/RachelPeters
