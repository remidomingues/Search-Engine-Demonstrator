20060508 22:54:35 nbsp Hi Faryn, welcome to the wiki. Usernames have to be formated LikeThis. If you plan on sticking around, I would suggest using your importance of using your RealName RealName. To change your username, click the settings button (upper right) and select Disable this account forever then make yourself a new account. Faryn isnt a very common name, and it would be easy for someone to find out who you are if they were so inclined, so you might as well use your RealName, or use a PseudoNym Users/ArlenAbraham
