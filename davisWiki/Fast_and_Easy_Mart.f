A 24hour convenience stores convenience store selling snacks, drinks, periodicals (including pornography), etc. During the summer, their chocolate candy bars are all mushy or melted. They carry the World Journal Chinese newspaper.

It is an excellent location for smokers  any time, day or night, you can walk in and get various cigarettes, including hardtofind Camel Turkish Jades and several flavors of Nat Shermans. It is especially convenient when running out of cigarettes while barhopping.

Commonly referred to as The Fast and Sleazy. There are always Lamplighter Players three dudes hanging out and playing music on top. The complex is known for outrageous themed parties: including Davis Celebrity, Early Nineties, Rockstars & Librarians, and Pornstars & Candybars.

During May of 2006 it was noticed that the Fast and Easy phone payphone was no longer there.

There is another Fast & Easy Chevron Fast and Easy Mart located at the intersection of Richards Blvd. and Research Park Drive.


Does this place have sandwiches? SS

A.K.A. Slow and Hard Users/TysonNichols

A.K.A. Fast and Overpriced! btw... hi Tyson! Users/MichaelGiardina

I urge a boycott of this place on account of high prices, poor soft drink variety, melted candy, and uncomfortably hot indoor temperature and because the stingy owner/operators would rather save money sweltering in a stifling hot store rather than turn on the air conditioning like any normal business. Users/RickEle

20051016 13:37:33 nbsp Totally agree about the indoor temperature.  It was even worse a few years ago.  All the candy bars were melted. Users/MisterProfessor

20051017 00:51:13 nbsp I used to hang out with people that would always call it Fast n Sleazy Users/GeoffJohnson

20051221 04:17:43 nbsp Awww ... Im surprised no one likes this place. I go here when Im studying on late nights. I think it probably is overpriced, but it has a much, much better selection than either the Chevron or Shell station down on Covell Blvd. Plus, theres a really nice guy who works there late nights and tries to remember the clientele that comes in (hes not that great with English).

20060120 18:09:09 nbsp I like this place for a couple of reasons. First, they had my favorite smokes (Nat Sherman Classics) for less than anywhere else I ever bought them. Ive since quit, and GOD how I miss them! Anyway  one incident sold me on this place for ever. I was in the middle of writing papers during finals week, and I made a run down there for something caffinated and a pack of smokes at 4 A.M. I didnt realize until I got my stuff to the counter that I had forgotten my wallet at home. I asked the counter guy (probably the same really nice guy Saul mentioned) if he could hold onto my stuff while I went home to fetch my wallet. The clerk said, Its OK, you come back tomorrow night and pay. Take with you! I was amazed that a convenience store clerk was so kind and trusting. I came back the next night and paid, and they landed a customer for life.  Users/BigDave

20060125 11:02:28 nbsp this place is cool, just dont  give them any shit... they wont take it Users/DqQuez

20080213 16:08:11 nbsp The items are not only way overpriced, and melted, but STALE!!!  I go here only as a last resort.  Unfortnately, it is a last resort too often.  They would overcharge for lottery tickets if they could.  :( Users/AnnieSirrah

20080326 22:57:30 nbsp The best thing about the Fast & Sleazy is that its open 24/7.  There are many nights when Im up late working on something and I run out of water, soda, whatever and all I have to do is go there and pick it up.  Granted, its not the most glamorous spot and yea, its hot and smells kinda funky a lot of the time, but, hey, its convenience and thats what you are really paying for, right?  Funny story:  Several years ago I made a midnight run for chips and soda.  As I was walking out towards my car, a middleage caucasian male approached me.  He didnt look shady, in fact, he sort of looked like he could be a professor or something.  Anyway, I stopped thinking he just needed the time or whatever.  But no, he asked me how much I charge.  I was confused; i didnt know what he was talking about.  He wanted to know much I charge for the night.  Thats right, he thought I was a bona fide prostitute.  I scurried away without another word.  I dont know how the hell he thought I was selling sex when I was wearing my UCD sweatshirt and had my hair up in a pony tail.  But he did. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090412 19:28:45 nbsp Everytime I go to this place, I end up having a bad experience (mostly as a result of poor customer service) and ask myself why I went in the first place. The owners are usually condescending and in a hurry to get you out, and their items are overpriced. If you can help it, go somewhere else for your needs.  Users/NavidZamani

20090624 18:09:49 nbsp I didnt like this place. The first time I went to buy a drink, I didnt see the small note on the table that said Minimum $5 for debit. So I took our my debit card. He gave me a mean look and pointed at the note. Then he mumbled something about an ATM machine. He didnt look overworked, so dude needs to chill out. Users/WengFF

20100610 11:04:13 nbsp The guys working there are total douchebags who: (1) are always on the phone while you are purchasing things; (2)Dont even bother looking you in the eyes or saying hi; (3)just plain creepy. The only semidecent employees are the younger ones.  Also, everything is sooooooo expensive it is ridiculous.  I wouldnt mind if i was overpaying for things if they just had some nicer employees, but the fact they are all extremely rude makes it that much worse!

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Fast & Sleaze Users/MissAmyLu

20110423 15:07:21 nbsp This used to be an AM/PM til about 1992, when supposedly they lost their business license after selling booze to an underage kid. Do they still have the note near the magazine rack saying This is not library so do not read magazeen here? Users/AlanSmithee

20120315 12:03:01 nbsp Did not enjoy the slushies here, but I liked that I could buy a big bag of skittles. Users/JQuest

20120409 16:07:13 nbsp DO NOT GO HERE. The people that work there are extremely inconsiderate and practically retarded, let alone how ugly they are. They care not for the customer, but rather for how much money they can get out of each purchase. For instance, I parked my car and went on campus for all of 45 minutes, come back to the parking lot and find that my car had been towed. I asked the guy and he said to basically get lost. Fuck him. Never go here. They smell and they do not attract people. NEVER GO HERE! Users/trevorlowenthal
  And if everyone on campus used their parking lot just for 45 minutes, theyd have no parking spaces.  Sounds like you broke the rules, got caught, and now resort to childish name calling and insults.  Not exactly a review worth paying attention to.   Users/CovertProfessor

20130424 19:18:35 nbsp No Rest room,No AC ,Over piced to much exploitation to poor customer Users/robertpaul

20130424 19:21:09 nbsp The owner is extreamly mean better not shop over here. Users/robertpaul

20130725 07:43:47 nbsp I dont normally jump on Davis Wiki to complain about a business but wow, this truly is a second rate convenience store. Incredibly overpriced (beer/wine can be up to twice as expensive as Whole Foods), hot as hell, and rude employees. Dont bother asking for specific change, even if youre buying something (when I asked for my $1.50 change in quarters, I received a sermon).

Dont waste your time or money.
