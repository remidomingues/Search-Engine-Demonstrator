A Hairstyles hairstyle in which the hair is brought up into a ridge along the center of the scalp, without shaving the sides; an abomination.  It only sort of slightly maybe almost looks like a mohawk.

Some people firmly believe that the fauxhawk is the most attractive hairstyle on a man.  Of course those people also believe that the guy sporting the style must have the attitude to go along with it.

And all who heard should see them there,Image(faux.jpg, right, thumbnail A bad artistic renditon of a fauxhawk.)
And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
