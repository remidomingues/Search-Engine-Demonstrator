Feather Falls Run is a race committed to promoting Okizu, a nonprofit organization that supports northern Californias families with childhood cancer. Together, we advocate the lifechanging community Okizu provides. We believe in supporting families coping with childhood cancer through teamwork and active living. All proceeds go to Okizu.
