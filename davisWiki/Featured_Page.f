br The Davis Food Not Bombs chapter has spent the last 18 years feeding anybody who wants or needs food through the generosity of the Davis community.  This year they need something a little extra: you!  The current members are retiring, leaving the organization without the people needed to keep the traditions of this international movement alive.  As the wiki:wikipedia:Food Not Bombs Food Not Bombs Wikipedia article notes, every chapter of Food Not Bombs operates on consensus. Besides collecting and distributing food for free, many chapters of Food Not Bombs are involved in community antipoverty, antiwar, and proimmigrant organizing, as well as other political causes related to social justice.  By adding yourself to the mix, you will be helping shape the local collectives voice of this widespread movement dedicated to helping their communities.
