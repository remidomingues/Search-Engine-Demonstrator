The February 2008 Primary Elections election will be held on February 5, known as Super Tuesday due to the number of states participating. Even though California voted to implement open primaries, the primaries in California have been closed since 2001 meaning that you can only vote for candidates from the party you are registered with (unaffiliated voters are allowed by the Democratic and American Independent parties to vote for their candidates; the other parties primaries are not open).Footnote(http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_decline.htm)

Prop 92 could increase all UC tuitions

Prop 93 speaks for itself.  Do you want to give politicians more time and money?

I havent made up my mind on the indian gaming agreements, heard good arguments from both sides.  Anyone have any more info? Users/WilliamBeamish

20080205 14:02:30 nbsp 93 doesnt exactly speak for itself. Its worded in a deceiving way. Its more of a shift of the term limit rules than anything. The politicians who are responsible for bringing the prop to the voters are trying to extend their own terms that are about to expire, but despite this I have heard that the new rules proposed in the proposition makes more sense in the long run even if it means doing  a favor to people who are trying to trick voters.
 I agree. It was actually the toughest proposition for me to decide on. I basically chose yes because of the argument you give. Ultimately I think this proposition is the least important of the 7. Users/MattHh
As for 9497, gambling really isnt a good answer to our budget problems. Sure it may contribute to our suffering state budget but think of how many home budgets of the lower class that it destroys. Rich dont gamble at Indian Casinos. Gambling is a cheap shot at taxing the poor. There has to be a better way to make money for the state.  Users/MischaGushiken

  Hmm, that sounds like youre implying that poor people all have gambling problems... Users/TimMonk
  I dont think I said all poor people gambling problems. Users/MischaGushiken
