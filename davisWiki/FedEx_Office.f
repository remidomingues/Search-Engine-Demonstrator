FedEx Office, formerly FedEx Kinkos which was commonly known as Kinkos... you go there and make Copy Shops copies and stuff... or have your Passport Photos passport photos taken...  They have a great hydraulic cutter, which can cut anything!  They charge $1.49 per cut.  So its cheaper to cut your textbook in half than to make business cards.  You can also hook your laptop to their print stations and use the Internet for 10 cents a minute.  There is a SonyPicture Station located in the store.

FedEx Office stopped providing notary services as of June 1, 2010.

wiki:WikiPedia:Kinkos Kinkos was founded in 1971 to serve university students at UC Santa Barbara  most locations were originally open 24 hours. FedEx Kinkos Davis initialized shorter business hours due to the high volume of UCD and City jobs, and the low customer flow between 12AM and 6AM. On 20080602, they http://consumerist.com/5012731/kinkosisdeadlonglivefedexoffice renamed themselves to the pithy and catchy name FedEx Office.  So much better than a drab and formal name like Kinkos.

This store has the latest FedEx pickup in town: 4:45PM MF and 3:30PM Sat. for express packages and 6:00PM MF for ground packages. A later 6:00PM MF pickup time is available for express packages bound for destinations within California, Alaska, Hawaii or Nevada, and select zip codes in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washingon. See the Fedex website for details. Otherwise you have to drive to the Sacramento International Airport airport. The last FedEx Ground pickup is at 6PM MF. The store became a FedEx Kinkos when FedEx acquired the company in response to UPS purchase of Mailboxes Etc. in 2001.

FedEx Office began offering free unlimited WiFi at this store beginning October 6, 2010. The rest of their 1,600 stores will begin offering free WiFi in the near future.

 Prices 




20050522 10:06:46 nbsp Recent experience: service is the worst I believe Ive ever experienced, and the prices are ridiculous. Kinkos will nickel and dime you with per minute and per piece charges. Save your money and visit one of the independent copy shops. Users/AlphaDog

20051003 18:27:41 nbsp I forgot my credit card there, they kept it for me & carded me when I picked it up again. No fraud to report so far... Users/JoFeuerstein

20051111 23:23:12 nbsp Can someone who works at Kinkos tell me what they charge for surface printing for CDs?  And do they have those thermal printers right in the store? Users/MikeIvanov
 20051205 11:03:49 nbsp I know they have to send CDs offsite. Users/DomenicSantangelo

20060123 09:38:48 nbsp Kinkos is open 24hrs..round the clock.  I know, I love them for that.  I was a design student, and many times I used their services making prints in the middle of the night. Users/JessicaJochim
 20060217 18:22:42 nbsp Why arent they open 24 hours anymore? Is it because they merged with Fedex? I know they cut the hours in the summer, but school is back in session! Where am I going to make copies at 2am? Users/HeatherKlinger

20060531 18:58:04 nbsp do they sell boxes?  i need largeish ones for moving. Users/JessicaRuygt

20060607 03:58:07 nbsp There is no longer a student discount available.  And I dont know about the savings of butts, becuase more often than not, they have refused to handle basic requests that most design students will have (posters, books, binding). Their computer programs for Adobe are ancient, and the prices can get grossly overestimated. Okay for color copying, not for projects.  Users/KristinRicherson

20060729 17:21:32 nbsp Rude employees, ripoff shipping and printing rates.  Users/BrianChen

20060731 22:03:48 nbsp I had a glowing review for their service a year ago, but time has passed and experiences have changed. I come in on average of once every 2 months. It seems like every time I need their selfprint services, their printers are down for maintenance. It may just be my bad luck, but I cant rely on them anymore for onthego printing. I instead go to Office Max as theyve been really nice and timely. With Kinkos service getting less friendly and the fact that theyre no longer a 24 hour location, there are very few reasons to come here. Users/DatNguyen

20070129 11:24:39 nbsp Each time I go there, the worse the service gets and the higher the prices. In the past year, they have quoted at least 4 jobs for me that I found other copy shops to do for HALF the price and twice as fast. I see absolutely no reason to visit Kinkos again. Try Office Max or Copyland instead. Users/JoRo

20070129 11:34:39 nbsp I went to Kinkos a couple days ago to make 2sided copies. I asked a guy for help, and he programmed the machine for me. The machine jammed, as did two others but he finally got it to work on a fourth machine. Then, he only charged me half price because of the hassle. I personally think theyre great, but there were several other people waiting for help while I was being helped, and they may not have thought their experience was as good...  Users/ElleWeber

20070130 00:47:40 nbsp Most people are unaware that the white space between the E and the X in FedEx makes a rightpointing arrow. Users/GreggAlexander

20070611 12:38:27 nbsp My experience at every FedEx kinkos is that as long as you dont need to talk to a person its fine. I really think they should bite the bullet and be 24 hours though, it would really help offset the fact that they are not very customer service oriented. Users/AnthonySoto

20070629 19:06:03 nbsp I recently mailed a package at Kinkos and had a fairly pleasant experience that went something like this.

Arlen: Hi, Id like to mail this package for cheap (implying ground).
Kinkos Employee 1: Here, fill out this airbill.
A: Uh, airbill? Dont you make a digital label?
K1: Yeah, but you need to fill this out first.
A: Ok. (fills out label, hands it to K2)
K2: You know, this would be a lot cheaper if you mailed it by ground.
A: Yeah, totally, thats what I want.
K2: Oh, then you dont need this airbill. (Types stuff into computer, generates label, tapes up box, tapes my RMA label to box). $8
A: Deal. Users/ArlenAbraham

20070822 15:58:56 nbsp Their pricing confuses me. I had three copies of a 300page training manual made a couple months ago. It cost $98, which I paid for with a UCD purchase order. Then, last week, I needed four more copies, as well as three copies each of two 150page training manuals. This second job cost $85, despite being more than double the number of pages of the first job. Oh, if you ask them to drill the originals, be sure to check before you leave that they did so. They seem to be very lax about this.   Users/AnnaJones

20070823 16:51:27 nbsp Worst service ever. I stood in line with one envelope in my hand (just for purchase, not shipping) for 10 minutes while several employees behind the counter stood around. Every once in awhile one would look up at me then look away. So, I took my business elsewhere. Users/kdub

20070921 11:47:39 nbsp my boss made me go here to make legal size copies because we have a business account with them. long story short, i convinced him later to do business elsewhere.  for starters, the whole place smells like a urinal. and after making copies (which took 2 mins), i had to wait 15 mins to get a fraking receipt. Users/JewpiterJones

20071009 nbsp I agree that this place has the worst service of any copy/mailing center. For the convenience of being open 24/7 you sacrifice a small staff that can communicate well. Simple jobs get passed to several people and lots of errors happen in the process. If it werent for their prices and hours, I would never go there again. Bad service doesnt deserve good business.  Users/DavisResident

   Theyre not open 24 hours a day anymore.

20071029 19:29:53 nbsp I used their shipping service for the first time today to mail a large package. The service was excellent(the guy who helped me gave me all the information I needed, including some very useful tips) and I thought the price was very reasonable. For some reason, the price I paid was significantly lower than the online quotes I got at both fedex.com and ups.com. Maybe I did something wrong when getting these quotes on my own. Users/Brad

20071113 17:32:26 nbsp I just looked all over the website on customer review, couldnt find one. I would like to comment that customer service needs a lot of improvement at the F st. location. Theres no courtesy. It was my 2nd time going in there today, and I was very uncomfortable with the staff during lunch hour. They seemed annoyed and wanted me to rush. Granted I was new customer so I wasnt sure how FedEx Kinkos works. In addition, corporate should finally decide about student discounts. I mean it shouldnt cost $2$4 to laminate something. Ill just go somewhere else with better service. Users/mikam

20071113 18:02:08 nbsp Ive called a couple times for quotes but the person on the phone never seems very sure what things cost; they give vague pricing which is quite expensive and I end up going to OfficeMax instead. The only reason Ive been to Kinkos recently was to fax something.  Users/ElleWeber

20080324 18:51:41 nbsp DO NOT have a package delivered here unless the sender has checked off the dropoff location.  You may never get it...  Also you need either a tracking number or photo id to pick it up. Users/SlutMan

20080515 12:21:55 nbsp I created a daviswiki account just so I could talk about the horrible experience I had with FedEx. Ironically, the service at FedExKinkos was very helpful, but the actual shipping with FedEx was HORRIBLE. I bought a new cellphone, and needed it quickly, so I used 2 day service. It was supposed to be shipped on Tuesday, but FedEx wont leave your package if you arent home. Also, they only attempt delivery three times before they make you pick up your package in Sacramento. I called that afternoon, told  them to take it to the leasing office and leave it there for me, but not between 12pm and 1pm because it would be closed. The driver went at 12:15...again, package not delivered. That day I called them and demanded a redelivery, and at the very least asked them to leave the package at the FedEx Kinkos downtown so I could pick it up after 4:30. Driver never responded. On my third try, I told them not to even bother delivering it, and to just leave it at the Kinkos in the morning. So I got my package three days late, and had to bike 20 minutes downtown to go get it. DO NOT SHIP FEDEX. Users/AaronSamson

20080701 11:44:06 nbsp They are good for copying, prtinting, and what have you. But some how whenever I try and use the FedEx counter there is always a some what ridiculous line and they dont ever have more than two employees and will never get more help. I find it very frustrating.  Users/JamesLDownie

20080824 01:12:45 nbsp it was a saturday i went there. i have a midterm on monday and i didnt notice shield library close early. basicly i was left no choice but kinko. expensive printing, lots of loading money to the card/going back to the laptop and installing the printer.

the price listed above seems to be outdated. it was FREAKIN expensive. service was fine, not the best but definitely not as horrible as people have had. friendly agents. will not go again unless having to.  Users/applepearpp

20090109 16:20:26 nbsp Until 20090717, they gave a 10% student discount with UCD Reg Card.  Uh, what? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090316 21:45:34 nbsp BELMONT is the greatest! I went in to print out my Save the Date cards for my upcoming wedding. Belmont was courteous, helpful, and very VERY PATIENT! Each time he tested out the finished product and gave me different samples to choose from so that I would be satisfied with the final outcome. I was in the store for approximately 45 minutes. He worked diligently with me and even gave me extra copies for way less than I would have paid for (his gift to my fiance and me). Hes truly a blessing. I HIGHLY recommend him. Ive never seen him in that store before (he may be a new manager or transferring from a different store) but if you need anything done by someone with undying patience, hes the man to see! Users/Ryinky

20090414 22:46:17 nbsp Belmont is really amazing. I came in today 10 minutes before closing. I needed to make buttons for picnic day and needed to print out my designs by the end of the day on good paper. However, my formatting came out weird and the designs didnt fit the pin size. THEN BELMONT CAME TO HELP! Just like for the user above, he printed out different versions so that I would get exactly the right size for my buttons. On top of that he was willing to stay 20 minutes after closing to fix all the problems I was having. He makes me want to go to him for help whenever I have any printing problems. THANKS BELMONT!Users/JonathanChee

20090507 21:55:49 nbsp Service was awesome at the fedex part of the store.  One guy (I didnt get his name, but hes tall, bald and I THINK he had glasses) was extremely friendly and helpful.  It was time for me to be closing up and going home, and he was just awesome. He balanced 3 customers exceedingly well, and when I left the bad mood Id been in when Id gotten there was gone.   Thank you, bald headed tall dude.  You unruined my day. Users/MasonMurray

20090617 19:32:17 nbsp Belmont is the best! He was very friendly and helpful, and very accommodating to my lack of understanding of copyshops and colors of paper and stuff. He really made my day. Does anyone know if theres a place I can send a satisfied customer report or something?  Users/JaneKostina

20090625 19:57:40 nbsp there is this guy named belmont who is really really really really helpful.
 Users/booboo

20090904 19:02:05 nbsp I come here a few times a month, every month for work and have always had good experiences.  Belmont is definitely one of the best on the staff and has been there for sometime, so he knows what he is doing.  I recommend him often and tend to prefer him since I know he gets the job done right.  I havent ever gone wrong with the rest of the staff, so I am never worried about my print jobs being done wrong.

One time, they even dropped off my order at my work instead of having me pick it up without even asking and I thought that was incredibly thoughtful since it very much saved me time.  Awesome people. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091106 12:06:03 nbsp I see a few other reviewers have mentioned Belmont.  I never actually knew his name (its obvi him based on the other reviews) but he is one of the best employees I have ever seen.  He is incredibly solicitous on top of that, and helps customers people get the best deal.  On numerous occasions he has totally made my day by suggesting I do my copy/fed ex tasks in a more economical way.  If I owned a business I would probably try to poach this guy  he makes the experience so much better. Users/soledad101

20091222 22:01:16 nbsp I see everyone mentioning Belmont, but I was helped by Robert today and received similar service as described in the previous comments. I was shipping some expensive canalphones and the package weighed about .25 pounds. He said I could probably just ship it via USPS and save some money. I wanted tracking, insurance, and convenience though, so I went with Fedex. Users/KellyM

20100124 15:07:34 nbsp I have worked with a lot of different Kinkos and various shipping places, and I this one is the BEST for one reason alone: Robert. He is the friendliest, most thorough, helpful and knowledgeable shipping rep Ive ever worked with! Sending packages can be a nightmarishly slow and tedious experience, but Robert so knowledgeable he is able to quickly ship whatever complicated package and instructions I throw at him. Thank you Robert for doing such a great job! You make my life easier! Users/cori82

20101028 13:44:48 nbsp Recent experience: Printing was fine, a little bit overpriced, but shipping was FREAKIN expensive. Print quality was not as good as other copy shops in Davis. Service was fine, not the best. The agents were friendly. I will not go again unless having to. Users/StanDavis

20101118 00:46:15 nbsp i wish they were open  Users/timlane

20101118 10:08:04 nbsp Seriously... I remember when they were open til all hours of the night when I was in College.  Great for procrastination and last minute work.  Now I just use them for FedEx drop offs... thats about all they are good for. Users/Aaron.Curtin

Shipping here is awesome, they have a packing expert, Rob I think was his name, who is very friendly (maybe a bit too friendly) and helpful.

20110818 17:20:41 nbsp I will gladly pay more to ship FedEx because Robert provides such awesome customer service. He is quick and always finds me the best rates. Major kudos!!! Users/PaulH

20120315 12:48:20 nbsp I work with FedEx regularly. They are knowledgeable, so easy to work with and always sooo helpful. Love Belmont and Lincoln and the rest of the team! Users/meadowcreek

20120322 14:15:29 nbsp Went in here to have a box made to ship an LCD TV. UPS quoted me for $90150 but box expert Robert at Fedex Office gave me some tips and we were able to do it for $12!! Also taught me what bogarting means. Fantastic service and Robert is the coolest guy ever.   Users/gurtecho

20121113 15:04:15 nbsp I have to agree with every else and say that Robert provides the best customer service imaginable and is a fountain of shipping knowledge. I ship frozen buckets of grapes for my business which usually requires me to explain a lot to the shipping company and results in them trying to gouge me with fees. At FedEx Davis, Robert actually taught me quite a few things about the pitfalls in shipping buckets and how I could improve my rates and packaging techniques. I was pretty surprised. He said the various professors at UCD ship all kinds of strange packages and that hes seen it all before. Anyway, I go out of my way now to use this FedEx Office. Users/MikeyCrews
