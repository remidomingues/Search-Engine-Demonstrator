At last, timeless fashion has come to Davis. Amanda Chan, a fashion design graduate from UC Davis, and Levi Roberts, a web designer, have been residents of Davis for 5 years. We are proud to start a fashion house to provide local, handmade, quality clothing, with inperson delivery and personal alterations service. This ensures a direct and more intimate shopping experience for the Davis community.

Amanda Chan manufacture every item in house, from tops to dresses. Thus, every customer will have a direct relationship with the maker. We want to provide our local community a new type of shopping experience.

Our goal is to open a physical fashion house in downtown Davis to provide our local customers with beautiful clothing while expanding our online presence to the global market as well. With enough support from the online and local communities, we will be able to create jobs for Davis residents, and expand our local production.
