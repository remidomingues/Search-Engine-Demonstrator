20060207 12:16:23 nbsp Is this similar to the Alexander Technique?  What makes it different? Users/JabberWokky
   20060207 15:40:32 nbsp The goals of the two methods are similar; their approach to teaching is different. The Feldenkrais Method leads student through movements that lead to a felt experience of, for example, being upright by balancing over the skeleton. The Alexander Technique, as I understand it, will describe the most efficient position and help the student assume the posture. Users/JeannetteHogan
