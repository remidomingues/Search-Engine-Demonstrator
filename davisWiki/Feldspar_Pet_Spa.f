20130409 22:16:40 nbsp Five stars all the way and a master groomer of her trade. I have been taking dogs to Feldspra Pet Spa for the last several months at my pet sitting clients requests to get their dog groomed while they are away. I have taken a variety of breeds from a poodles,doodles. to shelties ,and a flat coated retriever. I frequent the shop on a regular basis and have taken my own dog a Labrador and cat into the shop to get bathed and groomed.The animals always smell great and their fur is silky soft thanks to the professional products Ann uses . Ann does a great job and is really dedicated and passionate about what she does. She is one of the hardest working people i know.  Her background in poodles is evident and they always come out looking fantastic. Not many groomers I know can groom a flat coat but Ann did a great job on Miss daisy. The shop is always clean and the staff is extremely helpful . It is very easy to book an appointment here and most dogs are not kept all day like most grooming shops who tend to overbook. Ann is a welcome addition to the Davis community. The dogs always come back happy, content and smelling wonderful. I highly endorse this salon. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20130429 15:54:23 nbsp Fantastic and highly recommended! Weve taken our Frenchie here since November 2012 and I would go nowhere else. Ann does a wonderful job and is clearly very knowledgeable about all things Dog. The first time we took our Frenchie here was our first time using a pet spa or groomer. Actually, we were a bit nervous (!), but Ann calmed us with her explanation of the grooming process. She was patient and helpful and took great care of our Louie! After our first visit, our handsome little guy came out all happy and groomed, with lots of butt waggles! Later, he was excited to return, running right up to the door for his second visit. Thats a real testament to Feldspar!  The spa is open, bright, and very welcoming. Give it a try...youll love it. Well be back again soon! Thanks Ann!! Users/MandB

20130625 21:29:11 nbsp My wife and I were walking our dog to Westlake this evening and when we passed by this pet spa there were 4 dogs at the door (locked inside) barking like mad.  Looks like they got out of whatever enclosure the staff left them in.  I wouldnt take my dog there knowing the staff are negligent.  Those dogs could seriously hurt themselves being locked inside the store all night with no supervision. Users/hokusman

20130626 15:32:22 nbsp Hokusman This is Ann Martin owner of Feldspar Pet Spa. The dogs inside were not left overnight and are not client dogs but my own personal pets who I bring to the shop on a regular basis. My family and I had just stepped out to grab dinner. Thank you for your concern and we welcome you to come into the salon anytime and observe. Have a great day.  Users/AnnMartin

20140304 13:38:10 nbsp I highly recommend Feldspar Pet Spa. I have been bringing my West Highland Terrier, Harry, to Feldspar Pet Spa to be groomed by Ann for about a year. Harry is 10 years old and has been to other groomers in the past, but none of them can compare to the professional grooming he receives at Feldspar. He has often come from other groomers with a cut that does not look anything like a Westie, and the grooming he received at Petco was horrible. The groomers at Petco made him look like they had tested various trimmer lengths, leaving completely shaved spots. I was thrilled to find Feldspar. I can always count on Harry coming out looking like a Westie, everyone is very nice, Ann always gets him finished quickly, and the shop is very clean. Its nice to get professional service from people who clearly love animals and what they do. Users/YvonneEmmons
