 Candidate Statement 
Hey Aggies!

My name is Felicia Ong and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the NOW slate. I am a secondyear Political Science and Communications double major from Fremont, California. My love for UC Davis and the Davis community continuously inspires me to be a strong advocate for our campus. I have served as the assistant to the former ASUCD President and am currently the assistant to the ASUCD Vice President. I am also on the External Affairs Commission, part of the Journalism Club, and an avid member of the Photography Club.

I am running for ASUCD Senate with NOW because I believe we are strong advocates of change and are determined to serve the needs of our student body. I am driven to accomplish the following platforms:

MAKE MORE STUDY SPACES AND STUDENT DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE DOWNTOWN
I want to establish greater community relations by working with local businesses to bring longer study hours and student discounts throughout the quarter. As a member of the External Affairs Commission, I have come to understand the importance of developing strong relations between students and the Davis community. To further strengthen this relationship, I plan to work with Downtown Davis businesses to extend their study hours throughout the year by featuring a “Study Spot Business of the Month” so that students are provided with comfortable study environments as well as special discounts, and businesses benefit from more exposure and more customers!

EDUCATE STUDENTS ON THE FUTURE OF THE UC
Most students are encouraged to participate in advocacy activities but do not know how the decisions being made in Sacramento will personally affect them. Many do not know who the UC Regents are or how their actions will affect the future of our education. I want to work with ASUCD’s advocacy units to make this information more transparent to students. I want to bring a large presence of pressing issues on campus during Lobby Month through forums and making information available online. This will help students understand how the actions of their elected officials impact them, oncampus services, and the state of the UC. I believe this is the first step in not only ensuring that students voices are heard, but also to empower our campus to act on the decisions that affect our future.

I look forward to serving you and the Davis community in the future. Please remember to vote FELICIA ONG #1 and NOW #25!
