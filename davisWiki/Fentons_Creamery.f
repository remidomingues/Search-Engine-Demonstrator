Fentons Creamery, a longestablished Bay Area icon, has opened a Vacaville Restaurants restaurant in the new Nut Tree center in Vacaville on the north side of I 80 80. Though you can order ice cream in a cone or cup like more Ice Cream local establishments, Fentons highlight is the large variety of sundaes that one must sit down and savoror perhaps even Good Ideas for Dates share.

Similar ice cream ice cream parlors can be found in wiki:sacramento:Ice Cream and Treats Sacramento, but Fentons should draw the East Bay transplants. The menu is mostly same as Oaklands, and yes: there are crab sandwiches here too. Unlike Oakland, there is more parking than you could Hurlers trebuchet sticks at. Their mascot, Myrtle, looks suspiciously similar to wiki:WikiPedia:Mooby the Golden Calf.



20070903 18:37:44 nbsp Its an easy stop on your way back to Davis from the Bay Area (or hey, why not stop in both directions?).  Theres a nice outdoor patio where, on hot days, they attempt to cool you with misting water.  Oh, yeah, and the ice cream was yummy.  For my fellow chocolate peanut butter lovers, theres is an unusual take on the flavor, with peanuts and chocolate candies in addition to the peanut butter.  Next time Ill have to check out some other flavors.  Oh, and as an added bonus, theres a little store right next door with a pretty good selection of Jelly Belly products, including the elusive JBz (think flavored M & Ms)  no need to stop at the Jelly Belly Factory.

20070903 18:57:17 nbsp The fried chicken salad was quite good and plenty of food for $8, but I was very disappointed with the crab salad sandwich. There was only the crab salad with a piece of lettuce on toasted white bread, and I thought it was meager for $13. I would still like to try the ice cream another time. Users/NickSchmalenberger
