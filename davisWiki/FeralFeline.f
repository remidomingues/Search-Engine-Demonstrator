 Foster Cats Need Forever Homes 


This page contains the current cats up for adoption by the Feral Feline Organization.  All cats are spayed or neutered, current on vaccines, and will be microchipped before going to their new homes. If you are interested in volunteering or fostering, please see the Feral Feline Organization website for details.

Boo


Boo is a 1.5 year old black domestic long haired female cat.  Boos mother was a feral cat living in someones backyard in Woodland.  She and her sibblings (with Taffeta also up for adoption) were scooped up when they were 5  6 weeks old.  She was quickly socialized and grew up with other adult cats and 2 dogs.

She is still fostered with her sister (Taffeta) and while we would love to see them adopted together, it is not necessary.  She is a bit shy around new people, but once she warms up to you she is very affectionate.  her favorite toy is a feather stick and she would love if you stopped by her cage at Petsmart to play with her.  She is looking for someone to love her.


Bruno and Chicago


Bruno is a male grey tabby and Chicago is a male light orange cat.  Their mother was a feral cat and they were rescued and placed with a serrogate mama cat.  They are now 6 months old and fully socialized.  Bruno likes to act tough around new people, but underneath hes a sweet kitten in need of some tough love. He has experience living with other kittens & cats, and he does great living the life of an indooronly kitty. Chicago may start off slow around new people, but underneath hes a sweet & friendly kitten. He has experience living with other kittens & cats, and he does great living the life of an indooronly kitty.


Big Tuna


Big Tuna is a 4 month old DSH grey/brown tabby with a white face and paws.  He was born to a feral mother living behind an office building.  He was trapped as a young kitten and socialized very quickly.  He is affectionate and will cuddle up with you when you are sitting or sleeping, and purr laudly.  He is definately a sweetheart and will do good in any environment.  He does well with other cats and is use to living with a dog.


Gypsy Rose


Gypsy Rose is an adorable little 6 month old kitten.  She was born to a feral mother but was quickly scooped up by some kind ladies when she was a few weeks old (after she was weaned) for socialization.  She is black with 4 white patches on her tummy.  Her fur is as soft as silk.  She loves getting her head rubbed and will stand on her back feet to get some head rubbing.  While she has lived the majority of her life in a cage, she is quickly settleing into the life of living in a home.   She is currently living with other cats and a dog.  As easy going and loving as she is, she would do well in any type of household.


Hershey


Hershey is a 5 month old black domestic short hair male.  He was born to a feral mother but taken into a foster home when only a few weeks old for socialization.  He was the runt of the litter but quickly caught up with his siblings.  According to his foster family, Hershey purrs constantly, loves to be held, can be a bit timid, but gets along with cats and dogs great.  He has good indoorkitty manners & would fit well into any kind of home.


Hippo


Hippo is a 1 year old black short haired male with a small patch of white on his belly.  Hippo was born on a rooftop in Davis.  A mama cat had given birth up there, but was unable to move her babies as they got bigger & bigger. Hippo is now a glossycoat kitty who loves to have his belly rubbed. He has done extremely well at his current foster home and has not scratched anyone, even by accident, since day 1 of his arrival. He gets along very well with the other foster kitty and they will solemnly groom each other, but he would also do well as an only cat. He has some recent experience with large dogs & rabbits, and seems to be able to adjust well to new experiences. He is just learning the joys of cuddling, and Hippo is a kisser who is perfectly happy to sit against your leg and purr.


Augustine


Augustine was abandoned at a vets office along with her 9 nursing kittens. She had a collar on with no tags, and it was evident that she had been somebodys pet. She is very sweet & is used to being an indoor cat. She was very thin when she was first found & it was time to wean her kittens. After weaning the kittens & feeding her a ton of food, Augustine has filled out to be a very pretty cat. She is very sweet & likes other animals (dogs & cats).

Ruby


Ruby is a 2 year old orange medium haired female.  She was a homeless cat who had already had multiple litters of kittens. We took her into our program, got her spayed, vaccinated, and dewormed.  She loves her new indoor lifestyle, & has good manners to show for it. She is very affectionate, she likes her ears and belly rubbed, and will often sit on your lap. She enjoys sleeping at your feet at night and will often follow you from room to room. Shes very talkative & loves rattlemice toys.  Ruby is currently learning how to walk on a leash, and will usually be seen on the leash at adoptions.  She has lived with other cats and does well with them. She would do well in either a single or multiple cat household.  She has lived with a dog before and does fine as long as the dog ignores her.  She is very friendly and takes well to new people.  She seems to get along with children.  Ruby would do well in a household where she can get lots of attention.



SallyAnn


SallyAnn is a 3 year old medium haired black and white female cat.  Sally Ann was an owned cat that was abandoned by her family when they didnt want her anymore.  She wasnt in very good condition, so we took her to the vet & started feeding her some good food. After a few weeks & some love, she was ready for adoption. She is somewhat starved for attention, and loves being pet. Shes a grumbler, so she growls like shes mad even when its obvious that she loves being pet. According to her current foster mom, Sally Ann gets along well with other cats who she has lived with, but could also be an only cat.

She likes to play with anything, and she likes attention. Shes a big fan of being pet & scratched on the chin, and although shell sit with you & keep you company, shes not much of a cuddler. After her initial adjustment period, she will sleep on the bed with you, but she really loves to sleep in closets. Sally Ann is also fine with having some extra space & just being independent at times.  She has had some exposure to dogs, and although she tolerates them, we think she would rather live without them.


Snickers


Snickers is a 5 month old black domestic short hair male.  He was born to a feral mother but taken into a foster home when only a few weeks old for socialization.  According to his foster family, Snickers gets along with cats and dogs, is affectionate & curious, & likes to be held.  He has good indoorkitty manners & would fit well into any kind of home.


Taffeta


Taffeta is a 1.5 year old black domestic short haired female cat.  Taffetas mother was a feral cat living in someones backyard in Woodland.  She and her sibblings (with Boo also up for adoption) were scooped up when they were 5  6 weeks old.  She was quickly socialized and grew up with other adult cats and 2 dogs.

Taffeta & her sister Boo remain in foster care together while their other siblings have long since been adopted out. As close as the pair is, we would love to find a quiet home to place them in together. They both do well with other cats & dogs, and they have great indoorkitty manners. We are sure Taffeta loves where she lives, but we would love to find her a permanent home. She is very sweet, playful, & fully socialized.

20071029 23:02:22 nbsp Nice job on this page!  Those cat photos are great! Users/RichLindvall

20071031 22:14:38 nbsp I just added you to my page.  Meows! Poox


20071209 15:08:54 nbsp I found a fantastic book called The Perfect Kitten, by Neville and Bessant, detailing many details of getting, training, and owning a kitten, and it has a nice section on Learning and Training, which at the end details a number of things to train your kitten on, from coming when called and retrieving to walking on a harness.  So far, Tzviya has mostly just learned that if I take out a specific toy for her to play with, she can sometimes get a treat from me if she plays with it around me.  Its a step in the right direction, I guess.

By the way, it makes me sad that Taffeta and Boo havent been adopted yet.  They seem like such terrific cats, and they were high on my list of kittens I was thinking about adopting when I was looking around a few months ago.  Snickers sounds like a good kitten too... Users/AaronRosenberg

Oh...right...so the training suggestion is to pick a toy your kitten loves, and start a chase game with it.  When the kitten gets the toy, call the kitten to you, then offer either food or an identical toy to swap for the one the kitten brings you (and to avoid playing tugofwar).  This is the essential bit of what it suggests, but that hasnt helped Tzviya learn that she is supposed to bring the toy back to me right after I throw it, nor that she is supposed to drop it at my feet or in my hand, rather than 5 feet away (my old dog liked to drop things just a few feet away too).Users/AaronRosenberg

20080114 07:59:13 nbsp Im hoping you can help me with a problem. Ive spoken to my neighbor about the fact that because she lets her cats roam around outside they think my back yard is their kitty box. Her reply is basically that cats are meant to be free. Im frustrated! Can you recommend some humane but effective way of keeping them and their poo out of my yard? Thanks! Users/davismom
  There are multiple things you can try.  You can get montion detecting sprinklers that will spray the cat.  Depending the size of your yard that could get expensive.  There are many plants cats do not like that you can plant, such as roses (cats dont like the thorns) and rue (cats dont like the smell).  Some other options, which I am not sure if they work are sprinkling pepper on your plants or ground up grapefruit rinds.  I hope that helps. Users/FeralFeline

20080628 00:38:32 nbsp There are a number of feral felines in Solano Park that would probably make good candidates for fostering and socializing.  There are a pair of female sisters, about a year and a half old, whowith very little socializationcould likely end up adoptable.  Some people here are mean to the cats, but my family is kind to them, and they have gotten to where they will approach and even meow (which is apparently not the norm for true ferals).  Its sad. :( Users/KendraSmith
