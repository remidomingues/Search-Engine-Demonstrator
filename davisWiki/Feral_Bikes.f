Feral Bikes are cagey, sometimes elusive critters found throughout Davis, having said adieu to houselife and taken up on their own under the big blue sky.  Life is often difficult for the poor things.  Some have even had seats or wheels amputated, and have been left to fender for themselves.

Reasons for leaving home
  Not enough exercise
  Depression when their owners graduate and get a job farther away
  Starved for TLC (Tender Lubrication and Care)
  Love affairs with Feral Cats, often involving sharing a plate of one uberlong spaghetti noodle, culminating in a kiss.

If you find a feral bike, please do your best to trap it and ensure it is spayed or neutered!  These things will breed like rabbits if left alone, and in no time Davis could be overrun with rusty little trikes.
