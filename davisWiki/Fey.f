Ordained: Imbolg 2009 by Elsa DieLowin

Fey Cooper is an ordained priestess in the Draigsffau tradition. She has loved teaching over 15 classes on witchcraft and paganism at the Experimental College, and hopes the number will grow. She is a founding member of the coven Casadh an Gaelach, and the founder of once coven Round Tower. She has a BA in Medieval Studies and a BS in Psychology. Her degrees in science and history give her a unique view of pagan practices which she uses to help students find their own truths given what they already know and believe, be they scientists, artists, psychologists or anything in between.
