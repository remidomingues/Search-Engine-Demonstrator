Ficelle (feesell) is a tapas Restaurants restaurant located in downtown Winters.  It is only open a few nights a week, and the menu changes frequently.  You order at the counter, and they keep a ticket open for you so you can add more food as you go.  Tapas plates typically cost between $511 and include both cold and hot selections.  They have some really interesting options like roasted quail, chile relleno in mole sauce, seafood canelones, and so forth.  For the price, the food really cant be beat.

They have a decent selection of wine and bottled beers and have a great house made sangria. Corkage is $10, but any purchase of wine or beer is applied against that charge (ie two sangrias free corkage).  Service is friendly and surprisingly fast, even when the place gets crowded.

Its a great destination (on days when its open) for a bike ride to winters, or a good place to pick up some food to take out to one of the parks along Putah Creek or to the Berryessa Brewing Company.

20130207 21:21:45 nbsp We got 6 dishes here and two sangrias for $60 after tax and before gratuity. Everything was really good and the 6 items were more than enough for three of us. The Teryaki Beef Skewers, Chile Releno de la Noche, and Canelone del Mar were the favorites. The others were good, but those three stood out. For this type of cuisine it really is tough to beat the price. Users/MikeyCrews
