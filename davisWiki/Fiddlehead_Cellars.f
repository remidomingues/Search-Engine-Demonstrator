Fiddlehead Cellars rests in Central Coast Lompoc, CA but has a business office in Davis. Go figure.

The company produces Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir; their Sauvignon Blanc grapes are grown in the Santa Rita Hills and Williamette Valley and their Pinot Noir grapes are grown in the Santa Ynez Valley. The Fiddlehead wine itself was featured in the movie http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/ Sideways, despite the fact that no scenes were filmed at the winery. Fiddlehead Wines may be found at some Nugget stores, according to the website, as well as at wiki:Sacramento:Masons_Restaurant in Sacramento.


20080423 22:52:12 nbsp A friend who works at the winery in Lompoc gave us a tour and tasting. Its not a very big operation and the wine is outstanding. The sauvignon blanc was some of the best Ive ever had give it a try if you ever come across it.

Oh, and I believe theres an office here because the owner is a UCD alum. Users/BrianLum
