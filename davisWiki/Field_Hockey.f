There are two Field Hockey teams in Davis.  Not to be confused with the distinct sports of Roller Hockey, Floor Hockey or Street Hockey.


Davis Senior High School Field Hockey:
 See the DHS Field Hockey entry.

UC Davis Womens Field Hockey:
The UC Davis Women’s Field Hockey Club participates in the Western Collegiate Field Hockey Conference, made up of teams from Cal Poly SLO, UCSB, UC Irvine, Santa Clara, and Chico State.  The main season is in the Fall, but they also participate in tournaments in the Spring. (http://sportclubs.ucdavis.edu/fieldhockey/ link)

Mens Field Hockey:
The nearest men’s field hockey is available in the Bay Area through the Bay Area Field Hockey Association.  Several people from the Sacramento Area participate in that league. The league matches are played on Sunday at either the Astroturf at Berkeley or at Stanford.  Further information can be found at http://www.bafha.org
