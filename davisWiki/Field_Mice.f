Any time a new development gets built on land that was previously farm land the previous residents will attempt to take up new living space. If you live in a recently built house chances are good that youll have a higher rate of these visitors for the first few years. As Town Wildlife local wildlife they are part of the food chain for Snakes snakes and Owls owls among others.

Note:  Mice are achingly timid and have a high metabolism.  Wild mice can die of terror, suffering cardiac arrest, simply by being cornered and picked up.  Please be gentle if you are dealing with a wild mouse and humane if you are dispatching one.
