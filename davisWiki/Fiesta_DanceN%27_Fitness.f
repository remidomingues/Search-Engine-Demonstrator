20090107 10:26:22 nbsp Been around since 2008. New location in downtown Davis. Call us or email us (see above) for more details. We hope to hear from you! Users/DeniseMathieu

20090507 09:38:35 nbsp My daughter has joined Fiesta Dance N Fitness for Bharatnatyam. The teacher is Khurshid. She is a very good dancer herself but she is also a great teacher. I like it that she doesnt stand a lot of nonsense from her students and excepts them to be committed to learning. She is highly motivated and clearly loves dancing herself. Last but not least, the price is very reasonable. Users/shruti

20090824 02:10:31 nbsp This place is awesome  Denise is talented, energetic, and knows what shes doing. The only downside is that you should call before going; more than once I arrived to find that class had been canceled or rescheduled. Users/tierramor

20091030 11:47:01 nbsp Theres a new studio on 3rd street!!! Its gorgeous on the inside with a really cool floor. Its at 915 3rd street, behind the 3rd Street Jewelers, across the street from Cable Car Wash, just past the railroad tracks. Users/ttl

20100620 17:20:40 nbsp Ive taken a couple of classes here and I really like the passport system which facilitates taking many classes. I also like the atmosphere with all the multicultural pieces and artwork, it is truly a unique environment. Users/Babhari

20101001 10:07:26 nbsp My daughter has taken Bollywood, Spanish Immersion, and Hip Hop classes here. Denise and Mr Q take are inspiring and kind. Users/JenniferMoylan

20130122 21:44:16 nbsp I tried the TurboKick class last week, and it was really crowded, which limited my range of motion (trying not to kick people/get kicked by others). The moves are also a bit underexplained for beginners. My friend was very discouraged by the class. I will try it again before I give up on it. BUT I tried Marlainas Zumba class last night (theme: Club Party) and it was AWESOME  super fun moves, and challenging while not leaving newcomers in the dust. The normal prices are too high for me (and they announced prices were going up in March), but I will enjoy my groupon while it lasts. Users/MeggoWaffle

20130316 23:56:07 nbsp I have never been to this places but I would like to stay there. I am a lover of Zumba classes in Las Vegas an I would like to know if there are places like Fiesta DanceN Fitness in Las Vegas. Users/DianaL
