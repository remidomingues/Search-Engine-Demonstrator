 
Fifth Avenue Place is probably one of the more strangely named apartments in Davis since not only is there no 5th Avenue, but its address is not even on 5th Street! This mix of single and doublestory units offers one and twobedroom apartments, one bedroom is $935/month and two bedrooms are $1095/month May 2008. It is located on Unitrans A Bus Line A bus line and P/Q Bus Line, kittycorner to both DMV and the main branch Davis post office; the Davis Police Department is just down the street.

This complex features a pool that is visible from Pole Line Rd. where most other complexes have pools surrounded by buildings, and a sculpture of a nude woman in bronze standing on two girders stacked on top of one another. The pool and the two story buildings are infill added around 1999. It is managed by Ally Property Management, Inc. Ally Property Management, which was the subject of a negative article by the California Aggie in 2008. The firm requires its tenants to sign a stricter form of lease than the more common Davis Model Lease. The property management firm has also been the subject of numerous other complaints by residents (see Ally Property Management, Inc.).

My friend lives here  it is decent.

20050201 02:31:10 nbsp I figured it was a reference to Fifth Avenue in NYC.  Sorta like Times Square Comics. Users/JabberWokky

20050629 22:27:39 nbsp Visited recently... all the cabinetry and wood is 70s brown... too dark for my tastes.  One unit has iron gating over the front door, scary to think that it is necessary. Users/AnnieSirrah

20060309 12:44:03 nbsp I live here now. They advertise Free Wireless DSL, but it has never worked well for more than a day or two in a row. The management is too cheeap to pay the company they get it through more money to make it better, and the company who does the internet, Baytel, never seems to be able to fix it.  Its literally sucked since I moved in.  If the free DSL is one of the reasons you liked this place, reconsider, because youll probably have to get your own internet anyway.  Aside from that annoyance, its not halfbad. Users/DavidBenjamin

20060412 09:54:08 nbsp The 70s brown stuff is all being ripped out and replaced with new countertops and cabinets and new doors inside.  They are installing washer/dryers into all of the units.  The Wireless DSL (a bit of a misnomer, ie WiFi) is spotty but manageable if you dont want to pay for net access.  I would recommend getting your own service though if you can afford it.  You are stuck with crappy ComCast cable service or rabbit ears if you want TV as they wont allow satellite dishes.  The yard is kept nicely and the pool seems to be maintained.  They are also one of the few pet friendly apartment complexes in Davis.  Just dont let them pee on the lawn. Users/HollywoOd

20061125 13:34:03 nbsp Dont stay here, The Manager is REALLY HORRIBLE!!!!   Told you everthing is ok before you moved out. but poped out so many problems at the last day and deducted the two third of your deposit!! Once you complained, they refund you 100$ and wait you to sue them!! Really bad experience! Be far from this psycho woman   Users/DaveRivers

20070317 21:54:10 nbsp Do they have a size limit on dogs? Users/KatHa

20080121 18:42:52 nbsp Under new managment. Very nice onsite manager. Upgraded interiors with washer and dryers full size units. Wireless internet is upgraded too. I love this apartment complex.Very quiet and professional. Users/misangelus

20080205 23:55:48 nbsp Hi, can anyone tell me if the two bedroom comes with two baths?  Also, about how much is rent for 2008 and about how many available units are there? Users/Katchabat

20080224 15:15:45 nbsp is there laundry in the apartments or is it a laundry room? Users/WeiChun

20080508 16:38:08 nbsp i just fixed the rent costs in the description...they are now accurate Users/AdamMartin

20080523 18:14:32 nbsp I just looked at these apartments and theyre pretty nice.  The apartments are spacious, with plenty of cabinet space, the apartments have wider than usual hallways and doors for wheelchair access..not to mention easier to move things in and out.  The grounds seem well maintained as well.  Most of the units have a washer and dryer in them, but some do not, but I noticed they had some on sight coinop machines next to the office.  Seems like a pretty quiet little area, not quite the party scene here as it maybe at other places.  Deposits are kinda expensive though...125% of your monthly rent, and 150% if you want to bring in a pet...but the lady there didnt mention anything about pet restrictions...just no massively huge dogs from what I understood.   Users/JasonA

20080706 12:01:48 nbsp Anyone else get ripped on a deposit? Thanks. Users/LouisM

20091002 15:35:51 nbsp The Good:  The rent was fairly reasonable and its across the street from the post office and DMV (and near Sudwerks!)
The Bad:  The first six months everything was fine, however during the two years I lived here we had mouse infestations (twice), water heater that broke down for two days, leaky bathroom sink trap, tub faucet that wouldnt shut off and ran for three days, bathroom mirror fell off the wall while I was at work, and neighbors dog that would bark incessantly. Ive rented a half dozen places in my life and this one had the most problems out of all of them combined.
The Ugly:  Since April/May of 2006 Fifth Avenue Place has had a change of on site management FIVE TIMES!!  Is this normal for Davis?
 Users/UMDGrad

20091103 19:02:59 nbsp They offer free Internet as a perk to rent here however, during peak hours 6am10am and 5pm10pm its largely unusable due to overloading of their Internet infrastructure.  Prepare for long periods of latency if you need Internet access during those time periods.  Outside of those times access to the Internet is quick. Users/Miley

20101209 14:39:40 nbsp This place is very nice, pretty quiet. My husband and I liked it here. More grad student and family friendly  definitely not a party complex. Pet friendly, dog size limit is 50 lbs. Katie, the new property manager, is super nice and they are quick to fix any maintenance issues. Each apartment has a pseudo/mini front porch. As of Dec 2010, the 1 bedrooms are $895/month. They upgraded to better internet and it worked fine at all hours, except right around 7pm  gets a little slow. Kitchen cabinets and counters are a bit dated, but most of the appliances are new. Users/rachand1
  I agree with everything youve written.  Ive always thought that an apartment complex is generally only as good as the current property manager allows it to be.  And having lived in 8 different apartments in my life, Id have to say that Katie is one of the best!  Users/ScottMeehleib

My friend said that as youre moving in, they make you sign a Mold Notification addendum to the lease warning that moisture can cause mildew and mold to grow.

20110920 19:56:24 nbsp PLEASE READ TILL THE END I made an account just to post this comment to warn others of what may happen to them if they make the poor decision of renting from this property: My general experience with this place was ok. But just ok.  The unit that I lived in was old and had bug problems but the neighborhood is quiet and nice and they are pet friendly too.  The maintenance speed is good and they come pretty promptly to fix whatever is wrong.  The management lady that works on site always said to me that the unit I lived in was old so it had a lot of little problems.  I once called Ally property and I have to say that whoever works there is RUDE.  Customer service is definitely not what they were providing, but snarky comments and a rude tone was all they could deliver not acceptable.  But this didnt affect my living there so it wasnt such a big deal.

Everything went from ok to W.T.F. after I moved out.  I cleaned the APT for DAYS, everything from the toilet to replacing the stove with new drip units and honestly, if I had moved into a new house that looked like the way it did when I left, I would say it was clean.  A month later I get a letter from Ally Property charging me $594.09 for Heavy cleaning, screens, blinds, repairs, and painting... WHAT. First off, my front door never even HAD a screen, and whatever damage there was on the screens was definitely not from me, I was only a subleaser and I only lived there for several months! A few of the blinds fell off from sliding it open and close so I can even make my peace with the rip off price of those but they even charged me for air conditioner filter and my AC barely worked!! The manager said that the house had known AC problems because of how old it was and they charge me for the filter change?!?! They also went ahead and sent me a bill for the ENTIRE UNIT being repainted.  WHY? the walls are exactly as when I moved in and the only damage I did was perhaps a few scratches on the door from moving furniture and what not so if they want to charge me for the door painting then fine but THE ENTIRE UNIT??! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!?  They are going to charge ME for the painting of the ENTIRE UNIT of a place as old and crummy as that?! THEY ARE THIEVES.  Like I said, I was subleasing and lived there for not even six months.  My lifestyle is quiet and not one of some crazy partyer and I lived in that unit as gracefully as humanly possible.  They are taking advantage of my security deposit and then some, to fix and polish an old, worn down unit and I do NOT appreciate it one bit.  This is a management property that thrives on the money they steal from students and if you ask me its a piss poor business overall.

Oh, PS and BTW, if the free internet sounds fancy to you, its only free internet if it actually WORKS.  It does not work.  Youve been warned.  Users/YLeigh

20121011 13:25:14 nbsp Lived here for two years before moving out.

Katie was the property manager at the time and she dealt with issues nicely; too bad she left right before I left the apartments.  Didnt really interact with the new manager but she seems nice.

My unit never had any bug issues, didnt use the free wifi, and the apartment was ok. Maintenance was done pretty quick for any problems (only issue was one of the stoves not working correctly/burning out).

Pros: Cozy apartment w/ washer/dryer, not a loud complex, pets allowed, decent parking
Cons: The water is super hard here so if the sprinklers spray on your car you will get hard water mark stains

Recieved most of my security deposit back (subtract carpet/painting).  I left the apartment like how I got it.  Im guessing if you live here more than one year youll get a better deposit out of it; as some of the reviews seem like they lost a lot of money?

This comlex is managed by Ally Property Management, so all money issues should be directed to them;

Only gripe was that Ally Property Management sent my security deposit back to the complex not the forwarding address I gave them and it took a good 3 weeks to finally get it. Users/tyang
