Filarees (Erodium moschatum), or storksbill, are those cool scissortype weeds that you commonly find out in dry empty fields not many of these left in California!
 okay, maybe theyre not so cool if youre a Dogs dog and happen to snort one up your nose. This naturalized Mediterranean weed from the geranium family appears during the weather springtime in Davis, and bears small purple spring flowers flowers with five petals. It is a freeseeding annual with a shallow taproot and hairy leaves forming a basal rosette.

It is the plants fruit that most people recognize  those scissortype things. Each fruit (schizocarp) is composed of five sections called carpels and a long, slender style column. When they begin to dry out, the mature carpels separate and as the styles uncoil, the carpels are forcibly ejected. Upon landing the style corkscrews the seedbearing carpel into the soil. Its at about this point that the plant becomes hazardous to animals sniffing about the ground.
