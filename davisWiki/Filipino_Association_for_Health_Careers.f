 Big Sib/Lil Sib Program 
The Big Sib/Lil Sib Program is FAHC’s peer mentorship program that partners a Big Sib, an established UC Davis UC Davis student, with a Lil Sib, usually an incoming freshman or transfer student. Big Sibs mentor their Lil Sibs through their transition into the university by serving as a personal and social resource, from offering advice to providing academic tutoring. And what better way to bond with your sibs than Big Sib/Lil Sib week? Every quarter FAHC holds events and activities everyday for a week in order for students to spend time with their sibs! Whether it be ice skating at the Vacaville ice rink to having movie nights or going to the ARC with your sibs, Big Sib/Lil Sib week is a great time to bond and have fun! If youre interested in getting a big sib or lil sib, come out to our meetings where you can find an application form and be sure to come to Revealing night!

 History 
 Mga Kapatid 
FAHC traces its roots to a committee of Mga Kapatid Mga Kapatid, Filipino–American Student Association, at the UC Davis University of California, Davis, between 1981—1985. The Filipino Association for Health Careers (FAHC) was established in 1981 by a group of Filipino students who shared the common goal of promoting health awareness and resources for people interested in pursuing careers in the health field. As a committee of Mga Kapatid, the leaders felt that as a separate organization, the group would be able to have more access to resources, funding, and room rentals.

 Cession and Establishment 
In 1985, the committee ceded from Mga Kapatid Mga Kapatid and established itself as an independent student organization with a shared vision of promoting health awareness and supporting students aspiring to pursue a health–related career. The newfound organization was registered with the Student Programs & Activities Center Student Programs & Activities Center at the UC Davis University of California, Davis as the Filipino Association for Health Careers.
