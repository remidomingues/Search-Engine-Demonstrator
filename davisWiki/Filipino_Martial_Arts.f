Filipino Martial Arts refers to many forms of fighting systems that originated in, or were refined in, the Philippines. The most wellknown, traditional branch of Filipino martial arts is Eskrima, an umbrella term primarily used for several forms of weaponfighting. Although the aspect of Eskrima most often portrayed in the media is rattanstickfighting, training with other weaponry such as knives, swords, and longer rods is also common. Some Eskrima schools also emphasize emptyhanded techniques.

Instructors that have a Davis presence include those associated with Baciarinis Martial Arts and Doce Pares Eskrima Filipino Martial Arts Academy.

Baciarinis started out as Pallens Martial Arts. The Eskrima taught there follows the style known as Senkotiros, continuing the lineage of Grandmaster Max Pallen. Pallen stripped down Eskrima to the core essentials, creating Senkotiros, which, in his belief, made the form more practical and effective.

Doce Pares is notable for teaching not only Eskrima but also YawYan Ardigma (Filipino Kickboxing). Being that Baciarinis began including a wide range of martial art practices in recent years, Doce Pares is probably the only school to be 100% based on Filipino techniques.
