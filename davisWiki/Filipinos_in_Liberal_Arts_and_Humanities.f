FILAHs programs adhere to this mission, allowing artistic and social outlets to its members, while contributing to the community at large with events that preserve Filipino heritage and challenge current sociopolitical issues. It is also a means for expression within the UC Davis FilAm community.The organization is open to people of all backgrounds, not just Filipinos.
