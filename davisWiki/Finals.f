Well sorta. Fortunately one can deal with finals week in a variety of ways. They include drunk getting pissed, eating yourself to death with your favorite foods, and Procrastinating procrastination (such as fooling around on wiki).


Campus is really empty during finals. One almost wonders where everyone is Study Spots studying. Computer rooms generally have seats, there are places to parking park and youre not going to get in a bicycling accident.

Saturday finals really suck, but at least you get free campus parking that day.

Optional Final Courses is an listing of courses where taking the final is optional, for whatever reason.



I think they are mostly all at Java California. Its been absurdly packed lately, even at 4am. Users/EricKlein

Wow 4am has got to be the emptiest time of day so exactly WHY were you parking at 4am? Users/BryanBell

20070610 00:33:43 nbsp Ive qualitatively noticed the spike in wiki edits during this finals week any chance we can put some numbers to that. Specifically if you peak at the Recent Changes list youll notice 3 or 4 people who dont normally make many edits adding comments to every Restaurants Restaurant on the wiki practically. And yes Im supposed to be writing a paper right now. Users/AlexMandel
