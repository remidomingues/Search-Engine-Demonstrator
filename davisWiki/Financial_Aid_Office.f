The Financial Aid Office deals with all of the Financial Aid financial aid paperwork for thousands of UCD students. The Financial Aid Office has a team of analysts and loan officers that process ridiculous amounts of paperwork each day. A team of students operate the phones and are there to help students figure out what they have to do to get their aid processed on time.

HOWEVER, many students will call in right before the drop date asking WHERES MY FINANCIAL AID??? ITS ALL YOUR GUYS FAULT when in fact, they have been mailed letter after letter, UC Davis Email emailed 23 times and are just too lazy to get it done on time and need someone else to blame.

If you are selected for verification, get your stuff sent in on time. If you filed your Free Application for Federal Student Aid FAFSA or FAFSA renewal past March 2nd, dont expect any grants or workstudy. If you get screwed over, dont blame the Financial Aid Office because its most likely your fault for not getting stuff done on time. If youre unsure about something, call or come in well before the due dates.

On average, the Financial Aid office receives 600800 calls a week and processes approximately 2500 individual pieces of paper!
