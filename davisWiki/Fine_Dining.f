Isaac and David, Masters of the Culinary Arts


Fine Dining is a worldfamous cooking show hosted in our very own Davis, CA.  This humorous, yet masterful show involves the hosts, David Provost and Users/IsaacHamlenGomez Isaac HamlenGomez, cooking and eating various delightful dishes.  And by delightful, we mean will make you sick.  Sweet.  By the way, thats us with BaconnOreos and Xtreme Toast.


The show was started in part by dogs.  They need to be walked.  While walking their dogs, David and Isaac brainstormed many meals for a potential cooking show.  Since there were so many awesome ideas, they put their plan into action.  With Users/DavidHopper David Hopper filming, the first of two (so far) episodes was held in David Ps kitchen.  They cooked two breakfasts, as a modification of what those nutrition idiots will tell you.  The final course was a fastfood style meal, but in a glass.  You can see it down there.  Burger, fries, and Pepsi, all in one.  Mmmmm.  The end result was a sick show and a bunch of egg all over Davids stove.



The second episode might just be better than the first, with more creative dishes and better filming courtesy of Joe.  This episode featured 2 breakfasts, as is typical of Fine Dining, but also a classier dinner.  It tasted better, too.
