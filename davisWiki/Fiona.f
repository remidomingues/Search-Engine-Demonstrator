  Fiona was adopted in August of 2010 from a cat rescue group in Sacramento by Users/LoriOrf and her husband.
  She loves to cuddle on the couch and sleeps on her parents bed on a pink fleece blanket her parents made for her.
  She is spoiled rotten and loved by everyone who meets her.
  She is a big fan of meowing.
  She enjoys purring and making biscuits as frequently as possible.
  She has a new brother named Mumford as of 02/16/13. He is a (maybe) 3 year old (possibly) Corgi/ Daschund and spaniel mix. Tis difficult to tell with shelter dogs :)
