Fire hydrants are used by the Fire Department and the UC Davis Fire Department. Davis has a total of 1,699 hydrants (IN TOWN, UCD has more). This is a photographic catalog of them.  In case your fingers and toes dont count that high, it doesnt catalog all 1,699 hydrants.  Yet.

 City Hydrants 

The City of Davis uses dry hydrants.  Dry hydrants do not have any water in them when they are not in use.  These hydrants are filled with water by turning the special bolt at the top of the hydrant which opens a valve, allowing the hydrant to pressurize from water in the main below.  This feature protects the hydrants from breaking in freezing temperatures.  This feature, however, makes use of the hydrants cumbersome in fire fighting operations because all outlets of the hydrants are charged at once.

 Campus Hydrants 

Unlike the City of Davis, the UC Davis university uses wet hydrants.  The outlets in wet hydrants open individually, expanding their usability in fighting fire. Wet hydrants can freeze and break in long periods of cold weather. Sometimes contractors hit them and generate spontaneous fountains.
