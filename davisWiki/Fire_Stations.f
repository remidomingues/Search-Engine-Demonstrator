In the early 1990s the fire departments of Yolo County renumbered the fire stations of the county by region. This is why the Davis area stations are numbered 30  34.

The station numbers of nearby communitys fire departments include 13 (wiki:woodland:Woodland Fire Department Woodland), 4145 (wiki:westsac:West Sacramento Fire Department West Sacramento), 26 (wiki:winters:Winters Fire Department Winters), and 81 (wiki:dixon:Dixon Fire Department Dixon). Dixon is located in Solano County and therefore has an unrelated numbering system.

This was on the south side of Putah Creek on the east side on County Road 98 (Pedrick);  the wind was blowing the fire north.  The UC Davis Fire Department responded. Users/BruceHansen
