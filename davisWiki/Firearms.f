Firearms is the term that educated owners use in referring to guns, such as handguns, rifles and shotguns.

UC Davis and other public schools and facilities have strict regulations about possession of firearms, so please remove any guns from yer truck rack before coming to campus. Some other Universities offer storage options with their campus police departments for students living on campus, but UC Davis does not.

In an attempt to encourage firearm safety, the Davis Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies periodically distribute free gunlocks as part of http://www.projectchildsafe.org/ Project Childsafe so we can avoid accidental shootings  when available, locks are in the lobby behind the forms shelf.

To learn about specific laws concerning gun ownership in California, please educate yourself on the http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/pubfaqs.htm California Department of Justice website.
  Handgun: A short gun intended to be held and fired with one hand.  Handguns are a legally defined item and are subject to fairly strict ownership laws. For example, you must be 21 or older to buy one of these.
  Rifle: A gun intended to be held with both arms, and to be fired from the prone, standing and kneeling positions.
  Shotgun: A smoothbore firearm for firing round shot or large slugs.
 Gun Safety 

 1. All guns are always loaded. Even if they are not, treat them as if they are.
 1. Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy. (For those who insist that this particular gun is unloaded, see Rule 1.)
 1. Keep your finger off the trigger till your sights are on the target. This is the Golden Rule. Its violation is directly responsible for about 60 percent of inadvertent discharges.
 1. Identify your target, and what is behind it. Never shoot at anything that you have not positively identified.

And for the children If you see a gun, stop, dont touch it, go tell an adult. (the slogan of the NRAs Eddie Eagle campaign)
     Okayso Im an adult who has no firearm training and minimal safety instruction, what do I do if I see a gun?  Report it to the police?
       If its laying in a bush or something similar, absolutely! At best, its a law abiding persons lost or stolen property. At worst, it was recently used in commission of a crime users/ARWENNHOLD
       If the firearm was legitimately lost, you have a legal obligation to try to return it to its rightful owner.  If it was used in the commission of a crime, you most definitely have the obligation to surrender it to the police.  If it were a long gun, you could conceivably try to find the owner yourself.  Since handguns require CA paperwork to transfer, the only option either way would be to surrender it to the police.  Disclaimer  I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. users/jimstewart

  Many years ago, Davis Lumber had a sporting goods section, but they stopped selling guns because they were used in local bank robberies immediately after purchase. There also used to be The Shooting Gallery Inc. in Vacaville.


 Buying & Selling Firearms 
  Go to gun store, pick out a gun (I want THAT one!). Theyll help walk you through the rest.
  If youve picked a handgun, theyll ask you if youre 21 years old (youll have to wait if not) and if you have a HSC (Handgun Safety Certificate).  If you dont have one, youll have to take a written test, correctly answer at least 23 of the 30 questions, and pay $25 (nonrefundable) in order to continue. If you have one, continue.
  Fill out a long boring form with your address, etc. for the background check. Make sure to answer the Yes/No questions truthfully and correctly.  The questions involve mental incompetance, felonies, drug convictions, etc...  Please note that lying on this form will leave you subject to criminal charges.  (If your answers on the DROS cause it to kick back, there is no loss on your part except possibly the processing fee, which is dependant on the gunstore you go to.)
  Put your thumbprint on the back of the form.
  Theyll put your info into the magic computer, and keep your form on file for a few years. For handguns, the state government keeps your records too. Before you leave, theyll tell you whether you failed the background check or not. If youre a normal person, there should be no reason for you to fail. If youre a criminal, you should fail. At least thats the way its supposed to work.
  If you passed, congratulations!
  Pay the store for your gun.  Depending on the price of the firearm, you may be required to pay in full or youll have the option of paying at least halfprice before leaving.
  Wait the statemandated 10 day waiting period.
  Then you can pick up your gun.  CA state law requires that the purchaser of a firearm have bought a cable lock in the last 30 days, and have the receipt for proof. In most cases, the firearm will come with a lock as part of the manufacturers package, but gunstores will also provide one too before you leave.  Some places charge for them...
  For handguns, when you pick it up youre required to do a safety check with a store employee unless you have a Concealed Weapons Permit.
  People trafficking in firearms should be aware that in California all transactions must be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer (FFL).  Dealers are required to process private party transfers upon request, and may charge fees. Antique firearms and curio or relic rifles/shotguns over 50 years old are exempt.

 Range Etiquette  
  Safety First.
  Absolutely no practical jokes or horsing around.  Guns are not toys.
  Each range has different rules. Take the time to learn the rules of the range you are at. The phrase But they let me at... should NEVER be uttered.
  An armed society is a polite society isnt just a quote from wiki:WikiPedia:Robert_Heinlein Robert Heinlein. Slow down and leave your ego behind.
  Never point any gun at anyone else. This means paying attention when moving the gun, or moving with the gun.
  Guns are loud.  Users/JabberWokky has a good friend who cant hear on his left side because a jackass thought it would be funny to fire off a round with the gun next to his head.
  Guns are sexy.  Women at ranges tend to be offered plenty of assistance.  Sometimes they can use it, and sometimes they know more about firearms than anybody else there.  Offering assistance to newcomers is polite.  Assuming every woman is new is not.  They also arent at the range to star in next years Stacked and Packed calendar.  They are there to practice.
  Guns should be left unloaded with the action open and the safety engaged (if it has one) except for when you are firing.
  Never put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire.  If you are holding a gun, leave your index finger extended along the side of the firearm, only going inside the trigger guard when you are pointing at your target.
  Its bad manners to ask to look at another shooters weapon.  OTOH, if someone complements you on the quality of your weapon, you are obliged by custom to offer to let him/her look at it.
  The proper protocol for handing a weapon to another person is to do the following in the other persons presence... 1) point the weapon downrange 2) open the action 3) inspect the chamber for brass or a live round and clear it if necessary 4) hand the weapon to the other person grip or butt first with the action still open.  The other person should verify that the chamber is empty as soon as he/she receives the weapon.
  Never dryfire another persons weapon unless invited.
  Many of these and more are taught in safety courses.  It is recommended that you attend one before you buy a gun.  Most ranges schedule safety courses at various times.

 Safety Courses 
 Highly recommended to anyone even considering owning a firearm.
