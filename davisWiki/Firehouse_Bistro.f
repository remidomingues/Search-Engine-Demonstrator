The Firehouse Bistro is located in historic downtown Dixon across the street from the police station. They serve dinner Thursday through Saturday and feature Tapas on Friday and Prime Rib on Saturday. They also offer breakfast and lunch Tuesday through Sunday. The food style is probably best described as contemporary comfort food. The breakfast is really good, arguably as good or better than Cafe Bernardo.
