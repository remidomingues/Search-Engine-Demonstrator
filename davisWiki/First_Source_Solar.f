20110506 20:10:30 nbsp I had First Solar replace my pool pump, filter and sweep with newer, state of the art pump, filter and pool vac.  Work was completed on a timely basis with care to quality.  Brian spent extra time ironing out some bugs and making everything work well.  Price was definitely competitive.  I am quite satisfied with results and heartily recommend First Solar.

20120228 15:40:38 nbsp I can highly vouch for Brians honesty, integrity, and experience with residential solar systems.  My experience is that there are some proverbial snake oil sales folks out there trying to sell you a solar system that wont perform as indicated on your contract.  Brian recently served as a consultant for us to intervene with an out of town company that gave us a bad installation.  That (to be unnamed) company is in the process of making things right for us  and avoiding us the pain and expense of taking them to court  because of Brians intervention.   I wish we had hired First Source Solar in the first place.   If you are thinking about installing a residential solar system do yourself a favor and speak with Brian.  Davis is a beautiful town because of all our trees  not necessarily compatible with solar panels.  Brian will give you an honest shade survey.  Hire a local firm to do your solar.
