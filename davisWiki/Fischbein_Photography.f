20080707 16:04:39 nbsp Scott took some family pictures for us last winter in the Arboretum.  They turned out excellent.  We were really pleased with the result, and Scott made the whole experience a great one.  I highly recommend him.  Good prices too! Users/MatthewPearson



20081212 18:59:33 nbsp Scott is an extremely gifted photographer, but more than that he will go out of his way to make sure that you have a successful and memorable event.  He is both professional and personable, and is a joy to work with!  His photos are absolutely amazing, as evidenced by his impressive portfolio on his website.  I cant say enough good things about Scott!  If you are looking for a photographer for any occasion (wedding, engagement, party, portrait sitting, etc), I would definitely recommend hiring Scott.

While I havent seen his professional photography, he hung out during one of our IM ultimate games and took some photos for fun and they were really spectacular.  Great action shots of layouts, throws, catches,  and so on.  He was unfortunately already booked on the date of my wedding last August, but he recommended one of his colleagues who was also fantastic! Users/TomGarberson
