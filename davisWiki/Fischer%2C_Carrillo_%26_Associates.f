20070204 09:40:39 nbsp The Yahoo group DavisFreecycle was also apparently spammed by the same group.  I say apparently because we dont know whether either of these acts were done as a conscience business decision, or by a disgruntled exemployee or customer.  Id suggest getting more facts before boycotting them.  Lots of strange stuff happens on the web. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20070204 16:51:20 nbsp It would have been nice if they had put some sort of commercial email header or title on the mail, but I dont think they were obligated too, and I see no reason to boycott them. The message is polite and was sent to people that it is likely to be relevant to, so I think it is an example of not bad commercial email. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090430 21:58:01 nbsp Guy Fischer is a nice guy. He was able to see me on short notice during the busiest time of the year for tax pros. I cant report anything bad about the service really although I was dissatisfied, I did have a rather peculiar tax issue. Every other client of his I saw seemed really happy, in fact there was this sense of relief on their faces, which I take as a good sign. I ended up having a dispute about my return, but he settled it quickly and to my satisfaction (although I think he was pretty annoyed with me) At least he was honest and true to his word an excellent thing in a professional. If you need help on a runofthemill, the IRSisouttogetme sort of problem, Id recommend him. Users/bpwhite

20110408 13:02:04 nbsp I highly recommend Guy Fischer.  I had always done my taxes on TAXACT before, but this year my taxes became more complicated so I decided to get them done by someone who knew what they were doing and Guy Fischer definitely did.  His price was very reasonable $175 considering I had 5 W2s along with other various other bank and tuition forms, and had gotten married this year and we were filing jointly.  He saw me on short notice in April, and had my return ready for me (with a bigger refund than I could have gotten myself) in 3 days.  Im highly satisfied with my experience, and will be going back next year.  Users/WhitneyMarie

20120205 11:25:29 nbsp I had Guy Fischer do my amended 2010 tax return, as well as my return for 2011. As a foreign postdoc who is now a resident alien, I had to pay back my federal taxes retroactively because Ive been in the country two years. I am sure many others will be in a similar situation. Rather than figure out the amended return myself, which was quite complex and would have taken a good while, I left my data with Guy on a Monday, and the four returns (two federal, two state) were ready to be mailed the same Friday. Total fee was a highly reasonable $225. Not only that, but Guy is local, and an affable, friendly face. I can highly recommend his work. Users/jamesegraham

20130604 02:32:27 nbsp Dont go here!  Guy Fischer did not return our phone calls or emails. He made a $16,000 mistake on our tax return.  He figured that we owed $20,000 in taxes.  Instead it was actually $4,000. He did not apologize and blamed it on hitting the wrong key late at night.  It took him six weeks to prepare our return. And we ended up having to file an extension. He blamed it all on family problems.  Well Guy, if you are not able to do the return, give us back our $1,500 and our files. Dont keep telling us that you will have it ready next week, this week, in a few days.  The entire experience was extremely aggravating!

20130622 11:22:57 nbsp My experience was almost identical to the comment above.

Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog and I used Guy Fischer for our taxes last year and were very pleased. Our tax return was handled in a timely manner, and the cost  $300  was reasonable and easily covered by the tax return Mr. Fischer helped secure for us. He even found a mistake in our tax return for the previous year, and he also provided advice about common mistakes that attract the unwanted attention of the IRS. We were happy with his work and had every intent to use him again.

This year, my wife and I contacted him in the middle of March, hoping to secure his services again. He emailed me back and said he would file them, but subsequent emails went unanswered. Eventually, Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog and I went by his office and were able to catch him facetoface. He said that he had been very busy, but had also suffered a personal tragedy that had forced him to be out of town for an extended period, right in the middle of tax season. Mr. Fischer said that he would handle our taxes, but that because of his backlog, he would need to file a tax extension. Sympathetic and trusting, we concurred.

Into April, we hadnt received a follow up from Mr. Fischer  which was a little disconcerting, because at our initial meeting, he hadnt taken any information from us. I, the trusting fool I am, believed that everything was fine; Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog impressed upon me the importance of stopping by and checking, just to be safe. I stopped by on April 15th, Tax Day, just to be certain everything had gone through  and loandbehold, Mr. Fischer had completely forgotten to file an extension on our behalf. He swore hed do it that day, and we scheduled a meeting two days hence for me to come by with our collected paperwork and hash out the details. We met, I handed over my tax forms, and he said hed have the return done to within two to three weeks. He also pointed out that, if we did owe taxes, the filed extension would ensure we owed interest. I accepted this as the price of business, but Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog was very displeased  the only reason we had filed an extension was because Mr. Fischer had needed one for personal reasons!

This meeting was the last time I talked or received any message from Mr. Fischer. I started to try to contact him in the middle of May, a month after tax day and a week or two after he had projected he would have our taxes done. He has never responded to any of my numerous emails or telephone calls. He was also not in his office at the different times I stopped by to try and talk to him facetoface. Eventually, my wife and I Carbahal & Company went with another firm.

Suffice to say, Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog and I were very dismayed by our experience here, and cannot in good conscience recommend Mr. Fischers services to anyone. Users/ProfessorHedgehog
