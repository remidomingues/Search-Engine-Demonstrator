I like a nice generous plate of fish and chips every once in a while.  I havent tried Dumpling House, but I did discover http://www.yelp.com/biz/oceanfishandchipssacramento in the Arden neighborhood of Sacramento.  They serve a great plate of fish and chips with a noticeable freshness thats hard to find.  users/jimstewart
