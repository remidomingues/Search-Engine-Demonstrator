If you head north on Anderson Road Anderson Road and look to your left, you will eventually run into one section of the North Davis Fitness Trail North Davis Fitness Trail. But even more interesting is the cute little gazebo that is located on a grassy area there. There are stone tables and chairs for your picnicking pleasure, as well as a really pretty roof of leaves that have beautiful flowers that bloom seasonally. Atop the gazebo are a flock of metal birds.  In addition to the metal birds, there are also beautiful sounding Birds and Bird Watching song birds that frequent the area.

Relax here while running jogging through the fitness trail, or set up a picnic for your significant other.  At sunset, the gazebo is purportedly a lovely place for a Good Ideas for Dates date (and ensuing Makeout Spots liplocking).
