Fitness trails are hiking and Backpacking hiking or biking paths punctuated by spots to stop and perform different types of exercise exercises.  Some trails exist in use but not on paper (so to speak) and others are designed and built with metal and cement.  They typically consist of stretches of trail that you can run, walk, or bike and stations at which you can do things like stretching, pushups, pullups, etc.

Fitness trails are a great alternative to the sweaty, preening, sausagefestival of the Rec Hall.  So if youre not worried about being seen exercising and you prefer the openair, try one out.

 Equipment Trails 

These are city or neighborhood funded trails with actual equipment for things like pullups or situps.
  North Davis Fitness Trail
  Holmes Junior High School Parcourse, in very bad repair (almost all gone)
  Walnut Park, on the South Davis section of the Davis Bike Loop, has an exercise course, starting around Barony Pl.
  VitaCourse 2000 consists of eight fitness stations spread over half a mile of trail. The path starts in Sandy Motley Park and continues along The Greenbelt south of Moore Blvd, ending at East Covell Boulevard.

 Ad Hoc Trails 

Just as people have developed a fantastic unofficial UCD Frisbee Golf Course frisbee golf course on campus, there are probably similarly existing fitness trails.  Since these trails dont need to be generalized for old and young use, they might be far more grueling or less intense than than the equipment trails.
  Covell Drainage Channel Trail  no equipment stations, but nothings stopping you from pushups and situps
  (please list yours, or one you know of, here)
