A tree made into five hearts, the Five Heart Topiary lies on the north side of East Eighth Street, a bit east of L. It was initially thought of by the owner, in conversing with his gardener he said he thought he saw a heart in it, but that he should carve out whatever he saw inside be it an elephant or cow. The gardener returned after his work completed, reporting that he found not one but five hearts in the tree. It was a bit of a complex Topiaries topiary, and the owner couldnt afford to maintain it, but the gardener, proud of the work and what it meant, said he would maintain it with the rest of the work for no extra fee. It was a personal project to him. Sadly the crafter of this piece, who also loved to skate on ice, perished after falling through the ice last winter (reference?).
