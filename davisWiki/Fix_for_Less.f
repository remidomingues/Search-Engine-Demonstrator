THIRD PARTY! appliance repair and Verizon Wireless dealer (in case you cant tell from the photo).  Repair estimates are $20.

Fix for less closed in June 2009, and has since reopened as Campus Cellular


20050103 18:46:06 nbsp Ive never heard of these guys fixing anything for less.  They completely broke my friends laptop.  And they offered to fix my $99 TV for $150.

But maybe my experiences were the exception to the rule.  Anyone had some positive ones? Users/JaimeRaba

20051129 18:12:48 nbsp A complete and utter scam. This place is SHADY. I bought a phone charger here, they said return w/in 30 days if it didnt work. It didnt so I took it to the store and whudya know? there is NOBODY there authorized to process a return. So the guy there says, oo just call the owner. so I do and he says leave the product and receipt on the counter with your name and address, and ill mail you a check. well, its a month later and no check. They are hereby reported to the BBB. Users/JesseUnger

20051203 10:06:02 nbsp I would agree that this place is shady.  The people never called me back like they said they would.  I always had to try to find them.  Two out of four times that I visited the store during their posted hours, no one was there.  There was a note stating that they would be back in 20 minutes on one occasion, but they never showed.  I also had a general Im getting ripped off feeling, due to the vague descriptions of what was wrong with my TV and what was fixed. Estimates are not free. I will not use them in the future.

20060410 18:28:20 nbsp This place is definitely dodgy. We went in asking some questions about their Verizon products and they never wanted to give a straight answer. We thought it was an official Verizon store and we later found out from Verizon that they are not even listed as a retailer. Users/ToniTabora

20060412 18:40:21 nbsp yup super dodgy. The guy wouldnt get off the phone with his friend, wasnt interested in looking for the battery I asked for and just had a blank stare. Not sure how theyre still in business. Users/KarthikRam

20060731 09:58:52 nbsp This place is without a doubt the worst computer repair place I have ever had to deal with. I took my twoyear old iBook G4 in after it crashed, and they said theyd have it back to me within one week. I finally got it back after FIVE WEEKS. They also charged me $500 for the repairs and labor, though I doubt that they actually did anything besides install a new hard drive weeks after I first took it in. Shitty customer service (not returning my phone calls, not really interested in helping me out until they were paidwhen I did hand over the check after getting my machine back, the guy was really nice all of a sudden), and they dont seem to know what the hell theyre talking about (it took them a solid week to give me a definitive answer as to what was actually wrong with my laptop, when even I knew that my hard drive had crashed). AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Users/AnnaHamilton

20090126 15:02:56 nbsp I had no problem with Fix For Less.  Is it owned by the same people?

We stopped getting a signal on our cell phones at the beginning of the year. After repeated calls to AT&T we finally got a technician who admitted that they no longer had a partnership with the owners of the tower near us (Wildhorse neighborhood).  Friends have always gotten a strong signal on their Verizon phones.

I work for the state and knew that Verizon gave employee discounts on many plans.  I contacted the state Verizon rep to get details. You order phones and plans from her and she ships the phones to you.  We wanted to take a look at the available phones so we went to Fix for Less. Thomas was very helpful, showing us all the phones, explaining the plans and options and benefits of some of the phones.  We asked about the state employee discount and he told us how we could get it through their store.  He checked if my email ddress showed I was eligible. While we were looking at the phones another customer was trying to figure out what to do with his scratched phone.  Thomas gave him a lot of options and found a phone in stock which had a nice rebate.

We went home to decide what to do, checked some more online and then called Fix For Less with more questions.  Aamit was on duty then.  He answered all our questions and said hed stay open late if we wanted to get phones that day.  We decided to change our service and get the phones right away.  Aamit was ready for us.  I appreciated that he didnt try to sell us any extras we wouldnt need, such as insurance.

Both Thomas and Aamit were very knowledgeable about the Verizon products and carefully explained how to get the discount and rebates.
