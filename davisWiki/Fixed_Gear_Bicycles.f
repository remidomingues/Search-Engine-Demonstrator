Fixed Gear Bicycles or fixies are one of the kinds of bicycles you may see on the roads of Davis.  Fixed gears are the oldest form of drivetrain on bicycles.  They are extremely simple from a mechanical standpoint, and this simplicity tends to be attractive to some riders.  The fixed refers to the lack of a freewheeling mechanism on the bike, so whenever the wheel is moving so are the pedals, and vice versa. If you pedal forward, you move forward, and if you pedal backward, you move backward.

They can be used by serious cyclists looking for a different type of training on the bike.  Around town, they are most commonly found under people who are just getting from point A to point B.

There is a large discussion of whether the fixed gear mechanism itself constitutes a brake, because it is possible to skid the rear wheel by using the crank and chain.  In Davis and Sacramento, the authorities have come down on the side of the bike needing a separate braking mechanism in order to comply with the law.  So, if you do decide to ride a fixed gear, be aware that riding without a brake will get you a ticket.

Fixed gear bikes are not commonly understood by those who do not ride them.  Common questions and their answers:

How do you stop?  A rider may resist the forward motion of the pedals, thereby slowing the rear wheel and ultimately coming to a stop.  More advanced stopping techniques include skidding and skipping, though the former is a very inefficient method of stopping.  Also note that the ability to skid ones rear wheel in this manner does not satisfy Californias requirement of having a brake capable of skidding a wheel. The bike can also have normal brakes (most people leave on at least one traditional brake).

Does it take more energy than a regular geared bike?  If you know when to shift on multispeed bicycle, a fixed gear will almost always use more energy. The rare exception to this is if youre riding your fixed gear at your optimal cadence at all times (no accelerating/decelerating) in which case the decreased weight/friction from the missing derailleur will end up saving you a small amount of energy. However, if you dont know how to use the shifter on a multispeed bicycle (as many people dont, sadly) then a fixed gear may take less energy.

Why would you choose this type of bike over one with modern features, including multiple gears and the ability to freewheel?  Some reasons:  For one thing a fixie offers many opportunities for doing tricks not possible in a traditional bike or even a bmx bike, including trackstanding, and riding backwards, to name a couple (these and more can be seen at http://www.bootlegsessions.net). It can also be a fashion statement (watch for hipsters). Mechanical simplicity. Visual simplicity. It can be common ground by which to meet new people. Alternate training style. Feeling more connected to the road. Better control on slippery roads. Fewer parts results in less, usually cheaper, maintenance. Lighter than the same frame built with a geared drivetrain.

Arent they terrible for your knees?  In a word, yes.  Especially if ridden with a high gear ratio at low speeds, a fixed gear bike puts more pressure on your knees than a geared bike.  Using brakes to slow down will help alleviate this problem.

20090729 17:17:17 nbsp Im aware that fixies have suddenly become very popular (possibly for fashion reasons).  But other than that, why would you choose this type of bike over one with modern features such as multiple gears, a freewheel, and...brakes (often not found on these bikes)? Users/IDoNotExist

20090729 20:28:29 nbsp Not that I have one, but I think its because they are simpler to maintain. Maybe the freewheel somewhat insulates the rider from the road also? I will probably setup my own in about 20 years after everybody else forgets about it. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090729 22:07:15 nbsp An analogy Ive used is driving manual vs. automatic. Sure, automatics will do most of the work for you, but driving stick gives you a better feel for how your car handles. And its fun. Aside from that, I can vouch for the simplicity aspect. I wanted to try to build a bike from parts found through the Davis Bike Collective and I liked how the fixie is a bike at its most basic level. I also wanted a blue chain and I could only find one for a singlespeeds. So yeah, guilty on the fashion charge too :) .  Users/KevinChin

20090729 23:33:45 nbsp An analogy Ive used is driving manual vs. automatic.
Bad analogy. Both manual and automatic transmissions are variable, unlike a fixed gear. This would fit more for an analogy between a typical manually shifted bicycle and one of those rare automatic shifting bicycles. However, if you really want to use the car analogy, you can call a manual transmission a typical multispeed bicycle, and a direct drive as the single speed / fixie. Users/aggie1100
  Hah :) . When I first mentioned my analogy to my wife, she called me on it for this same reason. True, the concept of shifting doesnt fit, but thats not what I was shooting for. I was thinking more about the sensation of riding, and the extra bit of effort you have to take into account with the fixed gear. You learn to drive with an automatic, then when you first try manual its decidedly different: you need to learn when to shift gears, timing the clutch to get out of first, etc. Similarly when I learned to ride my fixie, suddenly I could stop without using brakesbut I had to take a few minutes to figure out how. Same with coasting (or lack thereof). Track stops at red lights (much easier on a fixed gear). But in the end, whether youre riding a fixedgear bike or riding a multispeed bike you are just riding a bike (balance, pedal, turn in the direction you want to go) just like driving either manual or automatic is still. . . well, just driving.  Users/KevinChin

In regard to the sensation of riding, riding a multispeed bike can give a riding sensation much closer to driving a manual transmission than a fixed gear. Everything from the sensation of running through the gears when accelerating to the selection of gear for optimizing either power or efficiency, etc. Even shifting your bike under power requires a certain amount of finesse to avoid crunching your gears (lowering torque until the shift is complete and/or timing shifts to release at the top/bottom of your pedal stroke where torque is lowest), much like managing RPM matching and feathering the clutch for a manual car. Also, the power response from a multispeed bike is much more dynamic, as you can quickly downshift from your usual cruising cadence right before accelerating for extra instant torque at the wheel, while on a fixed gear you dont get to feel that extra jump unless youre in a very narrow cadence range. Not to mention you can take turns way more aggressively on a bike with a freewheel, as you can raise one pedal while you lean.

A manual car will often punish you by stalling or jerking if you do things incorrectly. However, riding a multispeed bike incorrectly doesnt give that kind of disciplining (aside from maybe having to push a large gear ratio from a standstill) so people arent forced to learn. Most people do not shift frequently enough, ride hard enough, or use a high enough cadence to experience this sporty feel. But, once they do, it can be just as exciting and novel as it is learning to ride a fixed gear for the first time! As a sidenote, most of this mainly applies to multispeed bikes with shifters which are within immediate reach of the hands (or knees for you downtube racers), such as trigger shifters or STI.

As for the extra bit of effort, I think a quote from Greg LeMond sums it up best: It never gets easier, you just go faster.

Loose analogies aside, I agree with whether youre riding a fixedgear bike or riding a multispeed bike you are just riding a bike (balance, pedal, turn in the direction you want to go). Though, learning to consciously use countersteering for snappy turns is another exciting thing to try. Users/aggie1100




20090730 00:43:16 nbsp On the shifting issue  is this equivalent to if I rode my (multispeed) bike with exactly one gear ratio all the time, and never shifted?  I know that Id be pedaling way too fast if I couldnt change gears as I accelerated.

On automatic shifting bicycles: are you referring to a CVT?  Those have essentially infinite gear ratios, where you are always using the best ratio for that particular speed.  This seems like the opposite of a fixed gear bike to me. Users/IDoNotExist

20090730 08:13:21 nbsp On the shifting issue  is this equivalent to if I rode my (multispeed) bike with exactly one gear ratio all the time, and never shifted? I know that Id be pedaling way too fast if I couldnt change gears as I accelerated.  Your multispeed bike would still be able to freewheel.  Take that mechanism away as well, and you have a single speed fixed gear.

On automatic shifting bicycles: are you referring to a CVT?  These are two different technologies.  Shimano makes a group of components called Coasting, which has a 3speed automatic transmission with coaster brakes (which I also find pretty sweet).  The NuVinci hub is the only CVT Im aware of in the bike world, and its very much a manual transmission (also very expensive). Users/BrettHall

20090730 09:35:47 nbsp Keep in mind that when you choose a gear ratio for a fixed gear, youre choosing the highest gear ratio youre going to be comfortable with while riding at cruising speed. In that case, you wouldnt be pedaling really fast during acceleration; instead youd be pedaling slower (with a bit more force) while getting up to that speed. And though youd probably learn to stop as BrettHall described (pedals with toe cages help), its a good idea to have regular brakes installed anyway. Users/KevinChin

20100531 17:22:07 nbsp I personally began riding Fixed Gear bikes about 6 months ago. I wanted the ability to ride quickly and being that Fixies are MUCH lighter then say a Mountain bike and average grade Road bikes(bikes with gears and brakes). i also found skidding and the tricks available with Fixies appealing. The bikes are very light and maintenance is very low.
People say its a fashion statement but in reality, everything we do is a fashion statement.
I personally top out with my gear ratio 48/16 at 30MPH. my cruising speed is about 18mph.
thesse bikes are practical for anyone. The skidding took me a week to learn and i have had no accidents.

I disagree that it takes more energy. once youve gotten past the first revolution of the crank, pedaling is half your legs and half momentum of the pedals. it kind of works for you in a way. I know this sounds weird, but i recommend trying one for yourself.
I ride a Kilo TT with Continental Ultra tires. i have three different types of bars depending on the riding style.
You can convert an old road bike or single speed bike with Cog, and a lockring. this will coast you roughly 40 bucks.. Happy and Safe Riding. If you have any other questions th3belov3d@aol.com  Users/Fixienthusiast

20100714 15:40:33 nbsp um, a conversion will also require a track hub. theres ways around this, but it isnt safe and i dont want to be on the same roads as people gluing cogs to old hubs.

I have a fixed gear bike, I also have many others. the track bike isnt any faster really than my other bikes, its the rider that makes a bike fast or slow. I got a track bike because davis is so flat changing gears isnt totally necessary. I do prefer a 3 speed for commuting though. I also like the huge tires on my 29er (gearing is way low on that because its a single speed mountain bike, but still fun). There is just something fun about the fixed drivetrain, I like how it carries your stroke through the deadspot. that said, theres nothing special about a track bike.

borrow a friends (god knows there are enough in davis now that everyone probably knows at least one guy with one of these). if it feels good, get one. if you dont like how it feels, get a different bike. they arent faster, they arent cooler, theyre just bikes. I know my girlfriend likes it because she feels the ability to slow down by resisting the pedals is more intuitive than just hand brakes (but coaster brakes dont offer enough modulation)

also, if you get one, put a brake on. I know some people who Id trust riding brakeless, but the majority of riders really do need it. Users/EugeneB

20110413 12:58:19 nbsp trackstanding can be done on any bike, not just fixed gears. its just easier fixed. Users/ChillMurray
