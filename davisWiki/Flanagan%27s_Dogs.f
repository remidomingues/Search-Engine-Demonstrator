Flanagans Dogs offered three kinds of dogs: regular hot dogs ($3.00), hot links ($3.75) and Chicago style hot dogs ($3.75). He also offered BBQ pulled pork ($5.00). Flanagan had to close up shop for a variety of reasons, most of which involved Davis being an anal retentive sort of town that hates this sort of business.  You once could have had your choice of fresh condiments added to any menu item; he also offered saut√©ed onions and chili as toppings. (For those that prefer fresh onions, those are included in the fresh condiments, along with tomatoes, etc.)  A small menu, yes, but everything is very delicious. He was planning on getting vegetarian hot dogs for those who dont eat meat. Poor Flanagan; sometimes dreams come to naught.

Drinks were also sold, like water and soda, as well as chips.
For a short time, Flanagans Dogs was located in front of Mace Market on 5th Street before moving to its most recent location in front of Aggie Liquor.  Of course, being relatively roach coach mobile, moving is not as hard for him as it is for some other businesses, except for the fact that competing businesses hate him like the plague.

20110604 19:35:06 nbsp This guy was in front of Aggie Liquor today, and said he planned to be there every day.  I dont know if this is in addition to the Mace Market location or instead of.  I didnt see anything about veggie dogs, but he did have pulled pork, and claimed to offer both pork and beef dogs (its always hard to know what is really in a dog!).  I had a chili dog, which I enjoyed.  It was not as good as Hotdoggers, but then again, Hotdogger was not open when I was there, and dog in the hand is better than no dog at all!

20110722 17:59:13 nbsp As an alcoholic, Im no stranger to this store. Why have I never seen this man? Is he some sort of phantom? Do I have to have to chant HOTDOGMAN three times in order to see this disembodied spirit who apparently sells ectoplasmic meat goods? Users/ScottMeehleib
