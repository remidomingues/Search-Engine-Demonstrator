Flannel Wednesday is a Holidays holiday occurring weekly on Wednesday that commemorates the accomplishment of making it to the middle of the week, a difficult feat after a long  Parties weekend. The Events event was created in October 2011 by undergraduate students Noah Dennis, Gino Grilli, and Ruben Almanza (all of which hailing from the Delta Sigma Phi Delta Sigma Phi Parties fraternity). The three Bros men have observed the holiday every week, by wearing flannel shirts throughout the day, finishing the day with a few beers and a recap of the days events.

In recent times the Holidays holiday has been participated in by large numbers of Students students, both in the Delta Sigma Phi Greek system and out (Sigma Nu GDI). It has become especially popular to celebrate the event by attending happy hour at The Graduate the Grad, or going to Uncle Vitos Vitos for $0.99  PBRs.


 Origins 
The Holidays holiday began when it became apparent that an original founder of the Events event was in the midst of celebrating a birthday on Wednesday. Already wearing flannels the three Bros men decided to go to the nearest Oxford Circle Park park and enjoy some Beer beverages.
