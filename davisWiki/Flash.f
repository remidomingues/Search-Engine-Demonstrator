Flash was (is?) a clever graffiti artist in Davis that made a mockery of several corporate logos and local murals around town. Notable pieces included a rather risqu√© alteration to the mural along Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y., and adding nipples to the Starbucks mermaid. Flashs name may have been longer, but few can accurately recall the artists title. A website was also maintained with a portfolio of work, but the algorithms of a google keep it suppressed from searches. If you see any of his/her work, post to the Urban Art page.
