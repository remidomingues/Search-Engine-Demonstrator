4/17/06 You will pay as much for sneakers here as you would at most mall shops or upscale department stores.  The difference is you will walk out with the best shoes for your feet and activity.  I spent $90ish on a pair of running shoes, but we went through six or seven different pairs, with me running up and down the street in each pair so the shoe guy could better define which would keep me from bashing the hell out of my knees and ankles.  After all this we talked about proper stretching and how to alter my warmup routine to take my own needs into account.  $90 sounds like a lot of money, but $90 and over a half hour of trying and testing may save me who knows how much more in money on orthopedic repair down the road.  Get into their database as a customer, and for every $250 you spend they give you $25 in instore credit. Users/BlancheNonken



I bought some running shoes here 2 years ago, they make you run to past the avid reader and back to look at your form. Service was pretty good.  Users/StevenDaubert

20090210 12:23:47 nbsp Highly recommend. I went to the store just as they were closing and the staff (I think it was the owner) stayed open an extra 20 minutes to help me. The service was great. She took plenty of time to fit my feet and talk to me about what I needed. I ended up with a great pair of shoes that I couldnt be happier with. I will definitely go back next time I need running shoes. I dont think the price is higher here than at other comparable stores. They may be more expensive than a Big 5 or Sports Authority, but thats because you get what you pay for. If you pay more here youre going to get a better pair of shoes that will feel better when you run and last longer.  Users/BethanyHelmboldt

20090620 17:42:15 nbsp This place is great. Excellent customer service: informed and very attentive. Users/jsg718

20091226 19:27:23 nbsp I bought some pretty awesome socks for my jogging better half here! Users/StevenDaubert

20100324 13:25:19 nbsp I absolutely love this store. You get a $25 gift certifcate for every $200 you spend...just ask them about it. Users/anaxor

20101023 13:59:48 nbsp I went to this place today and was very pleased with the customer service. The sneakers I got out with are great and not more expensive than the prices I had seen in other equivalent stores. The salesperson spent about 20 minutes helping me figure out what shoes were appropriate for me. He observed me running on the sidewalk and looked at the pattern of wearing on my old pair of sneakers to help me make an informed decision. The store will give you U$25 credit after you spend U$ 200 and seem to have a fair return policy (though I have not tried to return anything to validate this information).  Users/AlessandraRung

20110205 11:34:25 nbsp Just stopped in here for a knee strap. It was totally buzzing (there was a sale going on), but the customer service was still really impressive!! It took less than 5 seconds before someone approached me to help. He took his time helping me out, explaining the options, etc., before I found the right thing. Another employee (possibly the owner?) even apologized when I had to wait about a minute for a cashier. Great service, and the strap wouldnt have been any cheaper at Big 5, but would have been lower quality. Users/MeganCleary

20110417 16:36:13 nbsp I went here today to find some track spikes for me since I am on the Harper Track Team. The woman there was super helpful and she found me 3 pairs of shoes to try on. She let me know what to look for, and how I should improve my speed/jump. She set me up with some New Balance 500 cleats and they are AMAZING! She also found me a pair of socks to go with them. And she put the spikes on for me! for free!  Users/Churro615

   Putting the spikes in, is like taking a breath, it is that easy.

20111223 21:46:12 nbsp This store came highly recommended to me by a physical therapist.  I bought a great pair of comfortable, affordable walking shoes here.  The people who work here have an astounding knowledge of shoes and the bodies and their feet that go in them.  They watched me walk down to the corner and back in a few pairs and really guided me in the fitting process.  I didnt realize Fleet Feet offered so many info sessions and training workshops until I read this page.  I plan to check them out.  Great shoes, great people! Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20120123 20:28:23 nbsp The people at Fleet Feet are likely the nicest people I have ever dealt with. They really take their time to find you what you need and dont try to sell you stuff you dont. I have been in the shop numerous times over the past few months as Ive started my running career and they have been so supremely helpful that I cant even put into words how happy I am with the service Ive gotten there. YOU GUYS ROCK. Users/Hastings1066

20120320 12:49:11 nbsp Before you purchase anything there, check the prices on other sports stores also in Davis. You will be surprised. Not to mention online prices for tings. I was looking into a belt to hold water for running and the one I liked cost 47 bucks in this store. At amazon, it cost 27. I understand that we need to support the local business, but to which extend are we morally obliged to enrich the pockets of those who want to overcharge for certain items?
 Users/AChaves
 It is not uncommon for some items to be on Amazon at nearly wholesale. $27 is probably a little more than the wholesale price. Brickandmortar stores often run into this. Nobody could make a living selling things at slightly above wholesale in a physical walkin retail location. I suppose regular retailers could just discontinue carrying things that are sold nearly at cost on Amazon, so you could do all of your shopping online. But they arent overcharging when retailers use industrystandard markups. Yeah, you can find things cheaper online sometimes. Of course, dont forget the shipping costs youll pay. Users/DonShor

20120509 22:36:35 nbsp Fleet feet is the place to go for good running shoes.  I tend to alternate between Fleet Feet and purchasing shoes online, since FF is a bit on the pricey side, but year or two its worth going in to try on some new stuff and make sure youre still going with the best fit, comfort, and durability.  I switched to a new model of Asics today after the salesperson recommended it, and I absolutely love them so far.  Quite a bit more cushion than what Ive been using, which may help with some occasional knee trouble that pops up after long runs.  It certainly doesnt hurt that the service is extremely friendly. Users/TomGarberson

20120516 20:00:39 nbsp DonShor, I paid no shipping costs. My point is that Fleet Feet is selling a product for MUCH more than you can get at Amazon. Not just a bit more, which I would be willing to pay to have a business running in my town. How can Fleet Feet survive the competition? I came by the other day and the product is still selling for... 20 bucks more. Give me a break.
 Users/AChaves
  Sunset Western Garden Book just came out with a new edition. It is prepriced at MSR $34.99. I would pay $20.99 wholesale. Amazon is selling it for $21.63. How much would you suggest I retail it for? Should I sell it at all? Users/DonShor

  You also pay for the service and fitting. A professional fitting like they are able to provide is well worth the premium you pay on the shoes. I havent been to the Fleet Feet in Davis but Ive been to several others in the chain, and they are all quite popular. Some people go there to get a shoe fitted and then dont buy. Very cheap, and a little dishonest. Users/TheOneElectronic

20130622 15:45:26 nbsp I had an excellent experience here today. The person assisting me, Aisha, was friendly and very knowledgable about products for walking and running. I would highly recommend going here if you want to be fitted for running shoes. Users/JocelynW
