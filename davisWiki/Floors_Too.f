The owner was really kind to me yesterday, giving me a scrap of sunbleached carpet padding he wouldnt be able to use on a job, so that I could (sigh) remove a caturinesmelly piece at my home.  He came to the store and opened up for me, and gave me the scrap for free.  Otherwise I might have had to go all the way to Home Depot in another town!  Very very kind. Users/HeatherCampbell
