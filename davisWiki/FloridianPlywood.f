20100222 19:52:33 nbsp A belated Welcome to the wiki!  I saw your comment on the Red 88 Noodle Bar page asking the manager to post the hours for happy hour, even though you seem to know what they are.  Maybe you didnt know that wiki pages  even pages for businesses  are created by ordinary editors like you and do not belong to the businesses (though business owners are welcome to contribute, of course).  So, you can go ahead and click the Edit button on the Red 88 page and add info about the happy hour, or anything else for that matter.  And the same goes for other pages. Users/CovertProfessor
