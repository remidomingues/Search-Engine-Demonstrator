The donuts are tasty.  They offer all types of donuts (sugar, glaze, holes, twist), apple turnovers, and croissants as well as other pastries.  Most pastries are under $1 each with donut holes being the cheapest at 15 cents each.

The Vietnamese sandwiches (Bánh Mì) are delicious.  They consist of a toasted French roll filled with carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, mayo(?), hot sauce and a type of filling.  There are three types of fillings for the Vietnamese sandwiches:  Vietnamese Ham, Pork BBQ, and Tofu.  The meat used in the barbeque pork sandwich is richly flavored.  Remember to specify if you want hot sauce or not.  Each sandwich cost $3.18 after tax.  They offer a Vietnamese sandwich and Tapioca Drinks Thai tea combo for $4.95.

Other items being sold are American sandwiches, chips, all types of drinks, coffee, and Thai ice tea with Tapioca Drinks tapioca.  There are some combo meals with sandwiches, chips and a drink so remember to ask. The menu on the wall says BAGELS but there are, in fact, no bagels.

Prices are low by Davis standards.  Recommended.  Also, perfect for AllNighters all nighters.  If we stay up another hour we can get donuts.

The decoration is plain and a little outdated but is still a nice cozy shop.  They offer free Wifi, carry a few newspapers and have a tv.  There is an ATMs ATM inside of the store, and they can give you cash back if you are paying by debit, making it a rather inexpensive and yummy alternative to the usual withdrawal fees.

Though ownership has changed over the years, Fluffys has been a Davis institution.  Unsure when it opened, but it was originally in the space now occupied by Starbucks. Through frequent University Mall mall tenant turnover, Fluffy and The Graduate the Grad have weathered the storm.  Fluffy benefits from some reasonably highvolume customers, which may help explain their longterm success.  They can be seen delivering sizable boxes of donuts each weekday morning to places like Saratoga West Apartments.

In the bad old days when the UC Davis campus had few UC Davis Police Department police officers on campus at night, 5:30 AM used to be the best time to pull off any kind of mischief. Thats because Fluffy was one of the few places to be open at 5:30 AM and patrolling all night tends to make one hungry.

PacMan History:
Davis is considered by many as the PacMan capitol of the world. The G.E.T. Pattern was invented at Fluffys Donut & Sandwich shop.  G.E.T. stands for George Huang, Ed Bazo and Tom Fertado.  The pattern is a near perfect solution to all PacMan tables from the first apple through the Eight Key.

5 am is the latest.  I used to live across the alley at Sycamore Lane Apartments Sycamore Lane Apartments and could have probably thrown something at fluffy donuts from my porch.  Oftentimes it would be open at 4am.  However, this was under a previous owner.  These days, it will very often be open at about 4:30 every day.  The closing time is rather indeterminant.  Usually about 4 or 5 pm on weekdays and about 2 on weekends. I recommend their apple fritters. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

20051013 17:02:56 nbsp Their Thai Ice Teas are to die for, but Id take Sunrise Restaurant Sunrises sandwhiches over Fluffy Donuts anyday.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20051106 22:09:27 nbsp the donuts are amazingly good and the owners couldnt be friendlier Users/JillWeinstein

20060110 21:08:47 nbsp The gracious owners/operators of this fine establishment once warned a sleep deprived friend about his selection of doughnut.  My friend choose the poor tasting doughnut aways after a moment of consideration much to his dismay.  Despite the outcome, we both appreciated the effort made by the establishment. Users/JamesMouton

20060111 21:27:06 nbsp Chocolateiced krullers are awesome.  Not too sweet, not too wet, not too eggy. Users/JudithTruman

20060125 23:56:54 nbsp I <3 the 15 cent donut holes and sugar donuts.  Theyve always been kind and courtesy to me.  I like the BBQ pork sandwich also D  But I feel like they have their heater on a bit too high Users/JoAnnaRich

20060324 19:51:18 nbsp I had their Vietnamese sandwich & Thai ice tea combo today. The sandwich was a little less flavorful than other Vietnamese sandwiches Ive had. The Thai Ice Tea was adequate, but not memorable. Hardly to die for. Just a cheap lunch. Users/SteveDavison

20060423 22:30:25 nbsp The donut holes are delicious!  The coffee isnt fantastic, but I like that theres a variety of brews.  The boy who worked the cashier on Saturday is a smart little tyke. Users/JennaChan

20060624 14:56:24 nbsp The american sandwich I ordered was on regular sliced bread and was around $4. Boo! The employees are very friendly though, and the iced mocha I ordered wasnt bad. Ill give them a second chance with their vietnamese sandwiches. Users/ErikStaab

20060625 00:22:00 nbsp I worked at the original Fluffys way back when.  I think I made $1.89 per hour and worked the graveyard shift helping to make the donuts and serving students who studied there all night.  This was when the place was open 24/7.  We had farmertypes coming in at 5:00 am and Id have to wake the students to tell them it was time to go home to clear the booths out for the morning crowd.  The buttermilk donuts were the healthiest, the baker and I decided, because he would use fresh buttermilk in the batter before cooking it in the hot oil.   Users/SharlaDaly

20060806 12:35:02 nbsp The doughnuts are usually good, and the owners are very nice.  I remember the male owner stepping in to help his wife with some difficult customers.  He had pretty impressive control of the situation.  The Vietnames sandwiches are okay.   Users/MisterProfessor

20061030 21:47:14 nbsp Their krullers. Best Ive ever had Users/TheStomach

20061110 21:27:06 nbsp Fluffy Doughnuts was the reason I left Krispy Kreme.  Their chocolatechocolate chip bar is a 1/4 lb of goodness. Users/ErwinSena

20061212 01:58:53 nbsp the sandwich/thai tea combo is ok...they are really cheap with the meat and the portion is tiny but donuts are decent here Users/TerencePhan

20070406 22:34:07 nbsp The Vietnamese sandwiches are worse than Sunrises, in my opinion. However, the croissants... omg the croissants... I love them Users/ThuHo

I love going here when it opens at five in the morning, usually after a night of not sleeping. Some good memories of freshly fried goodness from this place. I heart the old fashioned, the blue berry ones are good too. Sandwiches are not great, but eh, I go here for the donuts. They give cash back as well when you use a card, it is nice, making it cheaper to get a cash here, with the surcharge, and a donut to boot instead of the on campus ATMs (especially if you use a nonlocal bank). Coolest memory is that at the end of the year (beginning of summer), I was there in the morning to be served by the owners youngest son, the older was stocking, it was bemusing to say the least to have such great service from the kid, the owner and family is pretty awesome for this among other reasons. ~Users/DavidPoole DavePoole

20070826 01:23:02 nbsp Great place to eat.  Vietnamese sandwiches are pretty good (and its unfair to compare them to San Joses sandwiches :P) and the Thai tea is quite tasty.  Great place to go, but bring cash. Users/AlexanderHo

20070908 10:03:03 nbsp Ive had some good doughnuts here  a jelly doughnut with lemon filling and a buttermilk doughnut.  Good flavor, not too greasy, not the best doughnuts Ive ever had but pretty darn good.  I Davis Wish List wish, though, that they made doughnuts throughout the day and stayed open into the evenings, perhaps even 24hour. Users/CovertProfessor

20071020 20:32:55 nbsp I love fluffy donuts.  As early as I can wake up any given day, they are open and ready for me.  Fantastically friendly service, delicious donuts, sometimes warm . . mmm.  If you live in Davis, you need to have Fluffy donuts in your life. Users/MissL

20071028 23:19:34 nbsp I dont like their icing much, but their donuts are okay. Do they have fluffly cream filled ones (as opposed to the custard they call cream)?  Users/AnnaF

20071225 02:00:33 nbsp I stopped going to this place a long time ago when i got shortchanged. Make sure you count your change. Users/mojo66

20081004 14:46:01 nbsp 1pm on a Saturday in October 2008: Maybe only 1 dozen plain cake donuts left, but they were still fluffy and tasty! The Vietnamese sandwiches are now $2.50, but still not bad for a starving student. Users/froggyhi

20090913 22:41:19 nbsp The owner is such a nice man. I came in once to buy a doughnut and found that I was a few cents short, but he gave it to me anyways and told me to come back another day when I had the change. Needless to say, I did. The donuts here are so good, my tummy smiles on the inside after I eat them. Users/kthrnngo

20091111 11:25:45 nbsp This place is a Davis icon.  Users/GJC02

20100313 17:27:12 nbsp I really like Fluffy donuts....when they carry the donuts I like. They almost always seem to run out I want: glazed (raised, the braid and sometimes donut holes too) Its like crack: Youre happy when you have it, you crash when you dont.  Users/KimN.

20100425 22:01:41 nbsp I love their Doughnuts. Ive never been inside the shop, but my church, Davis Christian Assembly always gets a big box or two of them on Sundays. Fluffy Doughnuts are soooooo good! I love eating them every sunday morning. Users/BryceH

20100526 16:56:24 nbsp I was craving a kruller. I havent had a doughnut since middle school. I walked in, the owner was very courteous, and got myself a chocolateiced kruller. This isnt the craving talking: Absolutely delicious!! lol :) Users/kg18

20100526 17:32:46 nbsp Croissants and the donuts are always solid (in a non literal sense)Users/StevenDaubert

20100620 05:07:00 nbsp Sandwiches are sriracha in a pure an unadulterated form. Donuts are fluffy as expected and when combod with a thai ice tea and a sandwhich, you start to wonder why Fluffy isnt as popular as Burger King.  Users/oxnardmalfoy

20100730 19:39:51 nbsp The owner is so friendly and their donuts are pretty good. I have never eaten cake donuts before because I always thought that theyd be too dry, but Fluffys powdered sugar coated one has turned me into an addict. Even the ones covered in chocolate and sprinkles tasted better than I imagined. Even their normal donuts are extraordinary. Doughnut holes, glazed, sugarcoated, you name it, are all made to the best amount of fluff and sweetness. Id work here for free if they taught me how to create such perfection.  Users/DavisFoodie

20101107 22:01:25 nbsp Tried their Vietnamese sandwich today. Bread was not very good and neither was the meat. Their donuts are pretty good though. Users/hankim

20110227 07:30:36 nbsp Had to buy some donuts the other day and my wife asked me if they give you a bakers dozen. It appears they do not, at least not for my 2 dozen purchase. I never thought about it and have been going to Fluffys since 77. Users/RichardL

Users/SaThai

20120520 17:04:49 nbsp I love this place.  Great stuff at great prices.  If only they were open 24 hours and had bigger coffee mugs... Users/MilesThomas
