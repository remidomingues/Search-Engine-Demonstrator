The http://www.yolobasin.org/events.cfm Flyway Nights Lecture Series takes place at the Yolo Bypass Town Wildlife Wildlife Area Headquarters Building on the first Wednesday of each month from November through April at 7 pm. Topics are generally wetland related and feature local issues relating to wetlands (such as the Davis Wetlands) and/or Birds and Bird Watching avian species, ethnobotany, fish passage, or local history. Join the Foundation and local experts for a night of enrichment and inspiration. Refreshments will be served. A $5.00 donation per person or $10.00 per family is suggested at the door excluding Yolo Basin Foundation Members.
