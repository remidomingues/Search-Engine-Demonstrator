The owner of Fo Paws, Charlene Benjamin, sadly passed away on January 18, 2010.  Details can be found on http://fopaws.wordpress.com/ this blog.  Groomers from Fo Paws went on to found Fo Paws Pet Grooming and Pawsitive Groomers.

Fo Paws was a pet grooming service.  Their motto was, The best of care for the best of your friends.

Full Grooming Service for midsized dogs was $45$55, depending on the condition of the dogs coat.  Full Grooming Service included bath, blow dry, fur clip, nail trim, ear cleaning, and expressing of anal glands.  They also did just a bath, comb, and trim.  If you called during grooming hours and everyone was busy with a dog, they might not have answered the phone, so you had to leave a message and they would call you back.  You generally needed to make appointments 12 weeks in advance.

20071110 13:28:31 nbsp After one dog owner after another recommended this place to us, we finally gave it a try, and were not disappointed.  The thing I like best is that you feel more like you are taking your dog to a friend than to a grooming salon  Fo Paws is in a small, homey house, and the people who work there are warm and friendly and obviously care about animals.  They were able to make specific suggestions for how to have our dog cut, and those turned out very well.  And somehow they are able to get the dogs fur amazingly soft.  Highly recommended.

20090217 18:11:33 nbsp I had read the review raving about the homey house feeling and how it was like you were taking your pet to a friend, and decided to try it out. I had the exact opposite experience. First, I was quoted a price according to the weight of my dog, and when all was said and done, they had upped the price (they claimed my dog was heavier then I had said, however she hasnt gotten any bigger since her last vet visit). In my experience with customer service, and as a customer, this is quite unprofessional. Also, I decided to come back early and wait around in the waiting area until my dog was done. This apparently was not ok with the staff there. They made me feel quite unwelcome, and that it was a strange thing that I would sit and wait for the last 45 minutes of the appointment. They also complained loudly about my dog, while I was waiting, and how she didnt want to stay on the table while they were trimming her. Afterward they told me it took two of them to keep her there. This was odd to me because, although my dog does not enjoy getting groomed (what dog does really?), she was well behaved the last time. At that time, I took her to a little old lady who did the entire thing alone and didnt complain at all when I picked up my dog. I recounted this story to the one of the staff at Fo Paws, and she walked in the back and told the other ladies. It seemed that none of them believed me and they even mocked me. After I left, I started to notice that my dogs haircut was actually done poorly chunks of longer hair hanging all over. So, when I got home, I trimmed those parts myself. Maybe it was just a bad day for the ladies of Fo Paws, but I will certainly never take my dog back there. Users/tufftiff
  I remember one time when I was a kid and went to pick up my somewhat elderly dog at the vet.  I walked into the room without her hearing a thing.  I could not believe how wellbehaved she was.  Then she saw me  she went berzerk trying to get to me.  I think most dogs are like that.  So, it is possible that much of your experience could be explained by the fact that your presence made it very difficult for Fo Paws to do their job.  And for what its worth, some dogs dont mind (or even like) getting groomed  generally, if they were groomed regularly and with positive experiences, starting early in puppyhood.

  I doubt they check this page very often.  If youre interested in a job, you should call or stop by.  I recommend that you do so either earlyish (say, 8:309AM) or lateish (5 PM at the earliest), because in the middle of the day they are busy with dogs, usually dont answer the phone and probably wouldnt be able to deal with you in person, either.

20090918 21:18:19 nbsp I have been bringing my bichon frise, and my pug here for years.  They are always professional, friendly, and very accommodating.  I have had several dogs, at several different groomers over the years, and this is by far the best Ive encountered.  I showed up for an appointment once when they didnt have my dogs on the books.  They insisted on doing them, even though I told them I could just take them to work and bring them back later.  I highly recommend them, literally, to all my clients. Users/Davidlm

20100119 22:25:46 nbsp I am very sad about Charlenes passing.  You always knew that your dog was in good hands with her. She was a caring and special person.  Users/CovertProfessor
