Fo Paws Pet Grooming is a pet grooming service that operates in Davis on Olive Drive. The owner, Terri Martinez, learned grooming during her 17+ years with Charlene Benjamin of the original Fo Paws. It is in Charlenes memory that she strives to carry on the legacy of Fo Paws. Their motto is the same, The Best of Care, for Your Best of Friends. Terri operated under the name The Craft of Fo Paws for a time until she obtained a business license for the name Fo Paws Pet Grooming.  Terri has operated in both Davis and Woodland, and is happy to now have a permanent, convenient location on Olive Drive near downtown.

Fo Paws offers a full line of pet grooming services for dogs, cats, and smaller family pets (rabbits, birds, etc.). Terri Martinez has been in the animal grooming and service business for 20+ years and takes great pride in quality service at a reasonable price.

Prices vary depending upon the animal and what youd like done, complete baths start at $20.00 & complete grooming, including a bath, start at $45.00.  Call to get a rough estimate and schedule an appointment and they can give an exact price before grooming your pet. If you call they may not answer the phone, so leave a detailed message and they will call you back. First time customers receive 10% off their 1st visit with any of the flyers Fo Paws is currently putting out.

They continue as always, to specialize in older dogs, cats, puppies & kittens having their first grooming, special needs animals and those whove been turned away from other shops or whove had a bad grooming experience. If youve ever hoped someone would treat your pet like you doyouve come to the right place.

20130119 14:56:06 nbsp Fo Paws is GREAT.  Terri took care of my nontoohappy, longmattedhaired cat with ease.  I highly recommend her. Users/HarrySpanglet

20130413 19:33:33 nbsp Terri is an excellent groomer! She is always good to my dog, and to me, too. While Oso does not look forward to going to the groomer, he is always contented when I pick him up. The setting is really charming, and when they are not busy, I often find Terri sitting outside on the porch with Oso waiting for me, just watching squirrels and enjoying the fresh air. I am so thankful that we have someone who is as gentle with our dog as we would be ourselves. With other groomers Oso used to get ear infections after a grooming, but hes never had a problem with Terri. She always does a really great job. We are so happy you moved back to Davis!

20130617 15:57:11 nbsp We went to Terri at The Craft of Fo Paw for the first time with our little Shih Tzu. She is great and did an awesome job. She is definitely delivering the Fo Paw quality grooming that I remember. My little guy is just so happy even at a groomer when we picked him up. Well definitely go back to her. Users/ChristinaChan

20130704 01:59:23 nbsp I just moved into town and was looking for a groomer for my longhaired, 14yearold cat. I called another place first and they never even returned my call, so I asked my vet and they recommended Fo Paws. Terri called back right away and I got in within a few days. She did the MOST AMAZING job on my cat! And so quickly as well! She works out of her home, so its not as scary to my cat as the big box stores and she only does one at a time, which is really nice. My poor kitty was traumatized enough from the move and because shes older, she gets stressed more easily now. Terri was so caring to my kitty; you can tell she truly cares about your pet.
Im also SO impressed with the quality of her work   its incredible! All the snarls were out of her fur, her fur was super soft, she did a sanitaryshave, everything! All this in only a couple hours. I would recommend Fo Paws for everyone! Thank you Terri!!!  Users/AlisonTaplin

20130911 19:06:07 nbsp Terri recently groomed my friends large female dog and did a great job. Terri is a sweetheart with the animals and the owners! She really cares & one can tell. She also does a great job of working with animals that tend to freak out / get really really tense Users/StevenDaubert

20140213 13:42:52 nbsp We took our very nervous, matted and stinky new adopted dog to Fo Paws. Terri did a wonderful job and made our dog (and us) feel at ease. We highly recommend Terri and Fo Paws.

Although she cant quite get into the car on her own she loves Terri when she sees her. Lucy comes back happy. Thats when you know youve chosen an excellent groomer. Users/taritippit
