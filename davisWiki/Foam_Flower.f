Foam Flower (Tiarella cordifolia), is one of nearly 700 members of the Saxifragaceae family whose members are native to the moist shady woodlands of North American and eastern Asia; this clumpforming perennial herb blooms from April to June when it reaches its maximum height of 612 inches. The genus name Tiarella is derived from the Greek Tiara, a term for a turban worn by ancient Persians and is reminiscent of the shape of the pistil.

It is an attractive perennial with leafy stems from 612 inches high and numerous mapleshaped basal leaves. The basal leaves are up to 12 cm wide and 8 cm long with a heartshaped base. The upper leaves are similar but smaller with shorter petioles and only 3 lobes. The single or clustered stems are erect or spreading. The inflorescence is an open raceme grouped in a foamlike cluster of tiny starry white or pink flowers. The shallow root system of this plant makes a happy companion of deep rooted plants. Propagation is by division or cuttings.

This plant has a high tannin content making it a natural astringent. Native Americans made leaf tea to cure mouth sores and eye ailments. Root tea was used to treat diarrhea, as well as made into a poultice for topical wounds.
