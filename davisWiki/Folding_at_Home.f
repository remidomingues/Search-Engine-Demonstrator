http://folding.stanford.edu/ Folding@Home is a great way to use your extra clock cycles to help out humanity.  Its a Stanford project that runs in the background on your computer using spare CPU time to help fold proteins in order to find cures for diseases like cancer.  The performance hit is negligible at most.  You should definitely be running it on all your computers.

There is now a http://fahweb.stanford.edu/cgibin/main.py?qtypeteampage&teamnum50131 Davis Folding@Home team! (50131)

Note that running it on a UC Davis owned machine may violate the campus computing policy and result in disciplinary actions.

Give us a holla if you are folding for Wiki.  So far its Users/ZacMorris, Users/AndrewChen, Users/MaxMikalonis, Users/JosephBleckman, Users/PhilipNeustrom, Users/ArlenAbraham, Users/DavidReid, Users/JesseSingh, Users/AmyZimmerman, Users/GrahamFreeman, Users/NicholasKnoblauch, and Users/GregoryGai.  We also used the new wiki server to crunch for folding until we moved the site over on 20060517.

20060420 18:20:47 nbsp What computing policies would we be violating to use UC Davis owned machines? Ive got a 7 linux machine cluster in my lab that I could let loose on this potentially (at least in the middle of the night), but Im curious what the blowback could be even if my advisor and I approve of the use of it. Users/EricKlein

20060420 18:50:15 nbsp Running a Stanford project that could potentially be making money (perhaps in the future) on UC Davis machines might be a point of contention later on. However, I am not familiar with this program, so I am probably completely off. Users/TusharRawat

20060420 23:25:49 nbsp Yeah because god forbid Stanford get credit for doing something like curing cancer with the help of UC Davis computers!  Because the money and the recognition is the important part, not saving peoples lives!  Id probably seriously smack someone who gave me Stanford making money from UC Davis machines as a reason not to run this on campus computers.  In other words, run it Eric and give me a call if theres a problem.  Ill put on my slappin pants. Users/ZacMorris
  20081105 20:36:59 nbsp There are all sorts of technicalities when it comes to who can do what with University resources. But to clear things up, the campus computing policy states that if you run programs that greatly impact shared resources then you are encroaching on others access and use. Im not the one who came up with it; just putting it out there so you know. And just so were clear, saving peoples lives is extremely important, but people who further cancer research should be rewarded for their efforts as well. Users/TusharRawat TR

20081105 21:07:25 nbsp Does the campus policy say anything about nonshared resources or personal machines?  Surely running something like that on a machine that only you have access to could not violate a campus policy, since it would not affect anyone elses use of the machine! Users/IDoNotExist

20090808 00:44:19 nbsp I just upgraded my computer and i was wondering if can join the team still? email shotokun16@gmail.com
Whats the password and team # Users/Erwin
  Team number is up top in the entry  50131.  I dont know of any password; I certainly didnt need any.  Ill also note that you reminded me that when I upgraded my server late last year, I never set the client back up. Time to remind people to check on their processes.  wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090808 12:10:45 nbsp Sure, some help with folding, but do they fluff? Users/robinlaughlin

20090808 14:08:58 nbsp Not at home.  They only do folding at home. Users/IDoNotExist
