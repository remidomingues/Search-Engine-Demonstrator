Folsom Lake is a reservoir about a 45 minute drive east of Davis. One can take both Interstate 80 and Highway 50 to reach Folsom Lake.

Folsom lake offers a variety of activities that Davis does not; camping, boating, waterskiing, jetskiing, hiking and backpacking hiking, and fishing. There are many camp grounds, some with easy access and some which takes some time to reach, but are more secluded. Check out the http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id500 Folsom Lake website for specifics. Lake Berryessa is another close reservoir that offers these activities.

The water level at Folsom fluctuates through out the year depending on snow melt and rainfall. In the spring the lake can be extremely cold as the water is snow runoff. Some parts of the lake also have submerged forests and brush which can cause problems for boats and can be dangerous for swimmers.
