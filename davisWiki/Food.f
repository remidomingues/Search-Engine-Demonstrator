Food, glorious food! Its a basic necessity of life, along with drink. Davis hosts a wide range of people, and for its size supports an equally wide range of foodstuff. Vegan food, Vietnamese food, bar food, international markets, and even a pretty good selection within our supermarkets help stock the cupboards and fill the tables of those less inclined to middle American cuisine. We even have a Food Science department thats always looking to come up with even more kinds of food! Take a look at what we have to offer, compliments of the Front Page Davis Wiki!
