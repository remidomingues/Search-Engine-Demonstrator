20101026 11:25:45 nbsp Hey FoodLover, how about introducing yourself here to begin to establish an identity?  Whats your connection, if any, to Helmus & Helmus?  Do you have any way of knowing whether they could have supported Prop 8 through some means that wouldnt have resulted in their names on the donor list?  Could it have been a reference to someone in the office other than the principals?  Are you able to say with any confidence whether or not they treat their employees unkindly in front of customersspecifically, in front of the person who left that comment? Users/TomGarberson
