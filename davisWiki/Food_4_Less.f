Food 4 Less is a warehousetype supermarkets supermarket with a texting style name. They do not require a membership in order for you to shop there.  They are living cheaply cheap! But beware, some food may be food poisoning expired or on the verge of expiring. However, nonfood items are a good deal! They carry dry ice.

It is similar to Grocery Outlet, except that Food 4 Less is a much larger store. Grocery Outlet is smaller than a regular supermarket, but Food 4 Less is a giant warehouse that is larger than a supermarket. Food 4 Less is more like a Costco warehouse (minus the membership) than a small market.

They seem to have a pretty massive selection of liquor, with a whole wall full of good stuff right by the checkout lines.

Food 4 Less is a franchise and the stores are owned by various owners throughout the country. The Food 4 Less stores in Woodland, Vallejo, and Cameron Park are run by Nugget Market.

You have to bag your own groceries, probably for costcutting reasons.
