The Food Bank of Yolo County helps to alleviate hunger and malnutrition in Yolo County by soliciting, receiving, inventorying and distributing Recycling and Donation Directory donated foods and grocery products to local charitable feeding organizations. The Food Bank distributes food to qualified charitable agencies such as food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency shelters, most of which provide food directly to needy clients. Current programs are: Enough to Eat program which is linked to the food industry donations from all over the nation, and the EFAP government commodities program available to qualifying individuals and families. There is always a need for volunteers.

The food bank also owns and operates the Quick & Fresh Market in Woodland. The market is open to the general public, but one of its primary purposes is to be especially welcoming to participants of the CalFresh and WIC Program WIC programs.

During an AntiWar rally at the MU during November 2004, the Davis College Green Party held a food drive for the Food Bank of Yolo County. Similarly, the Davis College Green Party helped sort canned food in November 2003 for the food bank.

In November 2005, in the spirit of the past (see above), some Greens from the Davis College Green Party decided to start collecting and donating money to the Food Bank. The Food Bank gets 9 times the value of cash donations. As such, a $10 donation was actually worth $90 to the Food Bank. The following people donated money to this cause:
  Users/JonathonLeathers  $10
  Users/RevChad  $10
  Karl Duesterberg  $10
  Users/MarieHuynh  $10
  Chris Rood Twiggie  $10
  Users/PhilipNeustrom  $10
  Margareta Lelea  $10
  Users/ArlenAbraham  $20
  Users/LindseyKrabbenhoft  $10

However, you dont have to be asked to donate in the future. If youre so inclined, you can donate money to the food bank through a check mailed to them or at the Food CoOp, where there are donation boxes by the registers. Likewise, you can use PayPal as shown on their website http://www.foodbankyc.org/help.html here.

If you would like black plastic carriers for a food drive or coin jars for donations, they will provide you with them as well.
