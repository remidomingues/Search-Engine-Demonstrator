Food Not Bombs (FNB) Davis has been serving Free Food free, delicious  vegetarian options vegetarian meals to the Davis community since 1996. They serve yearround (except for rare occasions beyond the control of the volunteers). FNB Davis hates waste. By reclaiming food that would otherwise be discarded and feeding people, we make a statement. FNB Davis (and those that eat our food!) is grateful to those who donate our source ingredients (Davis Food Coop,  Delta of Venus, Village Bakery, and others) and those who provide our kitchen facilities.

I cannot praise Food Not Bombs and those that make it happen, enough. They are a model for how all service organizations should function. I consider them the most truly spiritual folks anywhere. For a small number of us, this one weekly nourishing meal makes a big difference in our lives. Oh, and the food! Delish! A satisfied customer

20070211 16:53:35 nbsp This is a great organization. If you have any food you want to share, bring it by Farmers Market on Sundays around 12:30pm and join them! The more food the merrier. Dont waste! Users/KiwiSelina
   I encourage people to bring food in a potluck fashion, but there is NO Farmers Market (sicplural possessive is correct) on Sundays in Davis. Go to Central Park, near where the Saturday and Wednesday Markets are held. Users/DougWalter
