Comments on a number of Restaurants restaurant pages have made claims of wiki:WikiPedia:Foodborne_illness food poisoning. These cases would fall under the jurisdiction of the Yolo County Health Department.

There may be an wiki:WikiPedia:Incubation_period incubation period for illness due to microbial infections that can range up to a http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/foodborneinfections_g.htm#happensbody few days or longer. If however, certain microbes have had the chance to grow in the food (such as leaving food out at room temperature), they could produce toxic products that cause a foodborne intoxication, causing you to be sick as early as an hour after consumption.

If you think that you suffered food poisoning because of eating at a Restaurants restaurant please call (530) 6668646 or email MailTo(environmental.health AT yolocounty DOT org) to report it before posting a wiki:wiktionary:snarky comment to the wiki. Keep in mind that they will want a list of the foods youve eaten over the past several days, not just your last meal. They may also suggest going to your physician because many symptoms mimic food poisoning.  Actual identification typically requires a stool sample.

Consult the Consumer Protection Guide for a discussion of conditions that might promote food poisoning and what do do about them.

20080927 02:07:23 nbsp Many daviswiki editors have claimed food to have gotten food poisoning from various restaurants, stores, and other foodserving establishments. I, for one, regularly eat food that has been purchased at such establishments, and have done so for the past 12 or 13 years Ive lived in Davis, and have never gotten food poisoning. I would be wary especially of restaurant reviewers claiming food poisoning; restaurantgoers are frequently quick to judge on this issue, despite the fact that it is very difficult to tell what food has caused you to become ill.

20100919 16:24:06 nbsp I think alot of the people who make these claims, are weak stomached and/or whiners who sincerely believe they got food poisoning. They probably dont really want to bring the hammer down on the restaurant, but just to complain a little on the wiki. Feh. Ive never gotten food poisoning in Davis either. Users/NickSchmalenberger
