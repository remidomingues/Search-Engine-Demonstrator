The UC Davis Food Science & Technology program is one of the largest in the US and the only program within the University of California. There are over twenty faculty in the department, many of whom are world leaders in their respective fields. Housed in the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science Robert Mondavi Institute (RMI), the department offers Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D. programs.

Food Science describes the application of science to develop, produce, and process foods and takes into consideration harvesting, processing, distribution, storage and preparation. It includes the development of dried, frozen and canned foods, microwave meals and T.V. dinners, aseptic food packaging, snack food development, Glossary fruit cocktail, processing of produce including nuts, vegetables, & fruits. Food Science requires broad knowledge of the various processes through which food travels from field to table, efficient use of resources and must also take into consideration sensory appeal of the final product.

Possibly one of the best things about having a Food Science department on campus is the many opportunities we have to taste test new food items! Sure, youll have to taste some bad stuff, but theres usually something good as well. Keep an eye out next time youre near Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science RMI for signs announcing food tastings.

The Food Championship is an annual tournament hosted by the department and its http://fsgsa.ucdavis.edu/ Graduate Student Association where teams compete in various foodrelated events.

Professor Carl Winter entertains fellow foodies with his http://foodsafe.ucdavis.edu/ songs about food safety.

 Courses 
Food Science & Technology classes are designated FST. FST 1 and 10 are popular GE courses.

 Lower Division 
1  Principles of Food Science (3 Units, Fall) This is a basic intro course touching on many different aspects of food science. Taught by E. Garcia.
3  Introduction to Beer and Brewing (3 Units, Fall) Taught by Charles Bamforth, this is one of the best classes to take at UCD. Its not an easy A, unless you go to class, pay attention and do the reading.
Food Science 10 10  Food Science, Folklore and Health (3 Units) Similar to FST 1, but focuses on social aspects rather than scientific ones.
50  Introduction to Food Preservation (3 Units, Spring) Covers a variety of food preservation and processing methods as well as a number of food properties related to preservation. Will be boring for anyone whos already taken a number of upper division classes.
