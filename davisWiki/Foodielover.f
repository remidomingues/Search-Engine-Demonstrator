Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. LoverFootnote(I now have an image of you as a black and white movie version of Don Juan, silk scarf flowing in the wind, waxed mustache over a big smile.), and welcome to the wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding your review to the Burgers and Brew entry!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
