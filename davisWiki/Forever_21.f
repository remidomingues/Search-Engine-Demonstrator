Forever 21  is a Los Angelesbased clothing stores clothing chain. They had an informal opening Friday, April 1, 2011 and had an official grand opening April 2. This store carries both the womens and mens lines of clothing.

The mystery of who will replace Gottschalks came to an end 05/18/2010 when the Sacramento Bee reported http://www.sacbee.com/2010/05/18/2757907/forever21signsdavisleaseat.html article that Forever 21 signed a lease to move into the spot. They specialize in trendy/fashionable womens clothing. Forever 21 also has nearby outlets in Sacramento and Roseville. They were also the antagonist of the Emmy award winning documentary http://www.madeinla.com Made in L.A. (2007) The lawsuit against Forever 21 was dropped, and Forever 21 agreed to take steps to ensure that their clothing is not made in sweatshops.




20110402 15:18:00 nbsp Waded through the masses and shopped at Forever 21 today. This store is HUGE! While it is not the largest Ive been to, it is a close secondfar larger than the store in Arden Fair Mall. They have a great selection of womens clothing, as well as a small section of bras/underwear, a medium section of shoes, a medium section of womens accessories, and a medium sized mens section (one corner of the store). The layout of the store is very open, so its much easier to navigate around without bumping into people (even with the mad rush of people today). There are two unisex dressing rooms, both of which had long lines today, but will likely calm down in a few weeks.
Overall I think this is a great store with a wide enough selection to satisfy the majority of shoppers. :) Users/Morganna

20110403 22:39:32 nbsp Does anyone know if this Forever21 has a plus size section?  Users/JenniferOrnelas
  VERY disappointed to say that they dont. For the size of the store they really should, but I guess they thought it wasnt necessary. In other large stores Ive been to, they do have plus sections, but not here. Users/Morganna

  Not a section, though it seemed that many styles had a pretty broad range of sizes on the rack.  Users/Rocksanddirt

  Thats terrible! Given the huge amount of space it is disappointing that they would not have a section to highlight their new plussize line. I guess Ill have to keep going to Solano Mall for that...or online...Boo!Users/ArianeMetz

  Actually they may have a tiny one. Most of the clothes Ive seen near the dressing rooms are plus sized.  Users/MeganYourFace


20110404 11:46:17 nbsp Went Sat Late Morning.  Oh the joys of teenage girl children.  /sarcasm.  Anyway.  Seemed like a well run store, the staff were obviously very busy, and some didnt seem to know exactly what was going on, but were helpful and friendly.  We had to make a return (two hrs in the dressing room line was not happening) later in the afternoon, and while the policy is fair and clearly posted there was a bit of a challenge to get the computer system to accept return items.  Appearently a manager needs to log in and password accept each return individually.  While it might help for return fraud it is a drag if you have more than one item to return.  In general high marks for opening day, and while Im not a forever21 demographic customer, Im sure well be back.   Users/RocksandDirt

20110410 12:31:10 nbsp I was so lost and overwhelmed in here, but in a good way The store kept going and going. Hooray for Fashion Sensory Overload! Users/jsbmeb

20110417 03:30:35 nbsp Well, I stopped by yesterday and the employees were having a bit of an awkward situation. The clothes shopping was nice until I heard some giggling and shock after an employee had found soiled jeans in one of the dressing rooms. I just thought that was absurd. A brand new pair of womens jeans wasted in such a gross manner. From the sounds of it, they handled the situation, but nonetheless an awkward sounding one for all the people there at the time of the incident. :P  Users/Weesito

20110426 02:16:49 nbsp Did Forever 21 add an exterior entrance? I thought that when the store was Gottschalks it only had an indoor entrance. Users/MaxLucas
  The lobby/indoor hallway thing by Starbucks is now part of Forever 21, so yes.

20110524 23:12:39 nbsp I like Forever 21, and this location seems great. I like the way the store is setup (its huge!), the prices are good, and the staff is friendly, from what Ive seen. Users/KianaFreitas

20120326 21:51:06 nbsp Not the biggest Forever 21 Ive been in, but its only smaller than the two story one at the Roseville Galleria. Like most of the Forever 21s, great prices for clothes and the only real clothing store that I can reasonably as a college student.

I cant say much about the help though. The cashier I had seemed very unfriendly and the girl at the dressing room wandered off multiple times leaving people to wait and not knowing what to do with their clothes. Another girl and I left our clothes on the counter because we didnt know where to hang them up at after trying them on.

20120415 I can say as of today that there is definitely a plus size section at Forever 21. Theres a sign up at the front and the clothes appear to be in the back end.
