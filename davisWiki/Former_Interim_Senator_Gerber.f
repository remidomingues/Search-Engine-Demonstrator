I wrote a letter to the editor that was rejected for various reasonable reasons. I still want people to see it and tell me how they feel. So, here it is...

        As independent senators, we commend the Aggie editorial board for its endorsement of independent candidates for senate. The California Aggie Aggies endorsements suggest that Independent senators deserve five of the twelve senate seats (with LEAD and Student Focus trailing with four and one, respectively). Were concerned, however, with the absence of Student Focus candidates from the endorsement list. We are independent because we want to see all candidates weighed on their qualifications  not affiliations. We feel that the endorsements, which represent the collective opinion of the editorial board, excluded qualified candidates just because of their slate affiliation.

        We are not concerned with the Aggies implication that Student Focus candidates are less qualified than the endorsed candidates are  that decision is the editorial boards prerogative. We are only concerned with selecting the senators based on a vendetta or trendy desire to see a whole slate fail. Its our shared opinion that candidates from Student Focus, namely Kai SavareeRuess, deserve an endorsement. We also feel that the barring of Student Focus comes from a desire to see that slate fail, regardless of the candidates qualifications. Decisions made in spite and anger are not in the long term interest of ASUCD.

20050223 22:07:11 nbsp I agree with you that Kai deserved an endorsement.  However, who knows what happened during his interview.  He is a calm and collected individual, but you never know how people will perform when surrounded by the Aggie editorial board.  I did rank Kai highly when I voted.  Users/AdamBarr

20050223 22:11:48 nbsp yeah, im a little disapointed that kai didnt get endorsed (obviously) but my issue has more to do with the general feeling towards Student Focus. There is a strong antiSF sentiment on campus and i think that they are becoming the scape goat for all ASUCD problems. i just dont want to see candidates overlooked by the voters just because they feel that its cool to hate SF  Users/AdamGerber

20050223 23:44:22 nbsp I think theres a difference between scapegoating for ASUCDs problems, and just not liking Student Focus agenda/just not feeling its in tune with what the campus needs. We havent had any seriously big problems in ASUCD like the 2001 rolling blackouts that prompted the gubernatorial recall, so there arent really big problems that were blaming on Student Focus. I think the general sentiment is just that Student Focus isnt in tune with what we want right now. But then again maybe Im missing something. Users/KenBloom
