This is one of the student design project under the MAE department.

Formula SAE (FSAE) is an international collegiate design competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and one of several student design projects under the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering MAE department. Formula SAE aims to give engineering students, as well as other majors, the opportunity to apply their education to real world designs. The UC Davis team designs, fabricates, and constructs – from the ground up – virtually the entire race car except the engine and tires; they even fabricate the chassis from steel tubing. The race cars are tested in competition against other colleges. At our previous competition where over 140 teams entered – we improved our previous best result of 36th overall to a 21st in the design portion of the competition. This year the UC Davis FSAE team is building a third generation car that will incorporate design enhancements motivated by our competition experience.

As of the Fall 2011 academic year, the FSAE team has transitioned over to the Baja SAE Baja series.
