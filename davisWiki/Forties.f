40 fl. oz. (1.183 liter) of fine malt liquor helps get your buzz on. Forties are a favorite among college students, alcoholics, and alcoholic college students. Most forties can be purchased for about the same amount a pint (16 fl. oz. or 473ml.) costs at a Bars bar.

This page needs updating, is anyone willing to come with me? It involves a lot of biking.  Users/ArlenAbraham
This page does need to be updated quite badly. Ill try to do my part as I buy forties from around town.  Users/AngusEubangus, 7/8/2012

Sadly the King Cobra is not $1.39 at Albertsons anymore, it is now a depressing $2.00  AFortyDrinker

Is it possible that the US Government is subsidizing the cost of cheap beer? I went to Music School in Boston in 19791981 and 32 oz. bottles (no 40s back then), were about $1.07  $1.20. Granted, BackBay Boston is an expensive neighborhood, but still, why is there nary a price increase in ~34 years? How do I remember the pricing so clearly? We diligently saved change and pooled our pennies to buy such, so we were very aware of the pricing. Users/BStein, 2/4/2014


 Abstract 
In this study, the prices of 40oz. beers are surveyed across every available vendor in the city of Davis, CA. Twentysix vendors were surveyed, twentythree of whom sold 40s or 32s, and the cheapest vendor for each type of 40oz. was identified. Data regarding 32oz. (1 quart or 946ml.) beers were also collected. Upon completing the study, 40oz. beers were consumed.

 Introduction 

The forty provides an ideal amount of beer or malt liquor for consumption during social activities. The average UC Davis student consumes 03 drinks when they party, according to data collected in recent years. A 40 provides only slightly more than the desired 3 drink perfect buzz. As such, it is critical to the well being of all consumers of 40oz. beverages to know the prices, selection, and additional information within their home town. In this case, a rigorous study of the prices and selection of 40oz. and 32oz. beer and malt liquor beverages in the town of Davis was performed.

Edward 40 Hands is an example of a Drinking games drinking game requiring the use of a forty. Much of forty culture also translates over to 32oz. bottles as well, but never 24oz. because they are usually considered too close to the usual 12oz. size.

 Materials and Methods 

Price information was collected by going from store to store and checking listed prices on the shelf. If shelf prices were not available, prices were confirmed either by requesting a price check, or querying the cashier. In some cases the cashier did not reveal price information when asked or revealed possibly suspect information. These cases are noted as such. Information was collected with a pen and paper, and photographs were taken with a digital camera.

 Data 
 How to use this table 
Below the data found in this study are presented in two tables; one for 40s and one for 32s. Each column corresponds to a different brand of 40 or 32, each row, a different vendor. The cheapest vendors of each brand of 40 or 32 are highlighted in green. The numbers in parentheses indicate the alcohol content in percentage of alcohol by volume. Question marks indicate that a given vendor sells the corresponding 40 or 32, but pricing was not available. Calculations do not take question marks into account. All prices are listed before sales tax and CRV.

 Calculations 
In this table, prices per ounce of ethanol are compared. In laymans terms, this table shows the best bang for your buck. For comparison, the approximate price of a 1.75 liter bottle of Smirnoff vodka is listed. Beers are sorted in descending order with respect to price per ounce of ethanol. BR

 Conclusions 

King Cobra at Albertsons was the cheapest forty, at $1.39.

In terms of dollars per fl. ounce, the firdy toos of High Life, Coors, High Life Lite, Red Dog, Busch, and Ice house at Quick Shop Market are the cheapest overall at $0.99 for 32 oz. (which equals $1.24 for 40 oz.).

For the most ethanol per dollar spent, Steel Reserve from Quick Shop Market is the best value.
