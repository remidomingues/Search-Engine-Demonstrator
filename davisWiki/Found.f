This hidden nook is essentially a curiosity shop. Her stuff is turnofthecentury (1900) to, perhaps, 1960s. Stop by and chat with the friendly owner.

Highland Warmth was here prior.

Aromatic soaps, vintage buttons (I have used many as replacements for the boring ones on my sweaters), blankets made from antique saris, strange masks, paper weightsmuch more!

20110516 00:02:30 nbsp While exploring Davis this past weekend, I was lucky enough to discover this unique, wonderful little store. It is just the right size, not too overwhelming and absolutely full of treasures. It was clear that each item had been lovingly found by Ingrid, the owner, and she knows the story behind each piece. The shop is full of unusual and intriguing items, many vintage pieces with fascinating stories. Nothing too cute or kitchy. I choose over ten items for myself and for gifts and the total was still extremely reasonable. This place has such a special feel to it, I cant wait to get back and see whats new!

20131022 16:42:30 nbsp Found is a lovely store tucked away from the main street but well worth looking for. Ingrid, the owner, is wonderful and travels to Europe to find beautiful antiques. She knows the story behind each item. Its definitely worth a (small) detour to see if you can find something precious and unique!  Users/SophiaBrattain
