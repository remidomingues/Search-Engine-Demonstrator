Fountain Circle Townhomes (or the FC, as the natives refer to it) is located on the North side of Alvarado Avenue between the Traffic Circle Alvarado/Anderson roundabout and Sycamore Lane.  The apartment complex is in North Davis just east of Highway 113 and North of Covell Boulevard West Covell Boulevard and shares the area with other apartment complexes and rental housing options making it popular with the students from UC Davis.

Fountain Circle Townhomes is one of three locallyowned and operated Davis apartment complexes managed by Davisville Management Company.  The other two apartment complexes for rent are Aggie Square, located on the East end of Alvarado Avenue, and Almondwood Apartments, located directly across Alvarado Avenue from Fountain Circle Townhomes.

Residents enjoy the convenience of living at Fountain Circle Townhomes. Located next to The Marketplace, renters have quick access to a variety of shopping options.  Directly across the street is a bus stop for the Unitrans G Bus Line (servicing the Memorial Union) and the J Bus Line (servicing the UC Davis Silo). Buses come by every 10 minutes. Direct access to bicycle paths and the Covell Greenbelt enable residents to enjoy many Outdoor Activities that are a part of living in Davis.

This apartment complex has a variety of rental options from which to choose. Onebedroom/onebath flats for those who choose independent living to fourbedroom/two bath 1849 sq. ft. townhomes for group and family style accommodations. Take a look at the floor plans below to find a plan that suits your lifestyle.

Image(FountainCirclePool.jpg, thumbnail, right, 350, Pool and Spa area at Fountain Circle Townhomes)Fountain Circle does have a pool and a spa, but said to be small in relation to pools and spas at other apartment complexes in Davis.  There is also a gym and a large clubhouse available as well.

The fountain is located at the entrance to the clubhouse!

The Fountain Circle parking lot shares pavement with Pepperwood Apartments. Be careful where you park as Pepperwood will tow unauthorized cars from their portion of the parking lot even in the middle of the summer when their lot is mostly empty. Fountain Circle doesnt worry too much about nonresident cars during the summer. However, during the year the parking lot fills up and theyll sometimes put orange warning stickers on unauthorized cars and maintains a list of repeat offenders.  The warning stickers are an initial attempt to warn people who do not have a valid parking permit but at some point towing becomes an unfortunate necessity for the sake of the tenants. A valid permit displayed on your vehicle is required to avoid unnecessary the expense and inconvenience associated with keeping spaces available for residents authorized vehicles.

Fountain Circle has been mentioned in The California Aggie on multiple occasions.  Most recently, Janna Buccieri, the Chief Operating Officer for Davisville Management Company, was interviewed as part of an article which highlighted the affordability of offcampus apartment rentals in Davis.  http://www.theaggie.org/2011/10/10/ucdavisamongthecheapestucsforhousingcosts/ Fountain Circle was also featured in The California Aggie in winter of 2006 after a resident came home to find burglars at his house who entered through the unlocked front door and was attempting to steal the residents stereo system.

Several burglaries have occurred throughout Davis in January, February and March of 2012. There is a strong chance that those responsible are posing as solicitors. The apartments are private property and are posted No Soliciting. Also, a City of Davis permit is required for soliciting which most of the these people do not have.

Action plan:
1. Call your manager and police 7475400 if you see people going door to door;
2. Dont let them in your apartment or answer any questions they may ask you;
3. Keep your apartment locked even if only leaving for a short time;
4. Ask management for free secondary window locks if you dont have them.

Please dont hesitate to call your manager for help if you feel intimidated or uncomfortable with making them go away. We all need to work together to keep our community safe.

The speed at which an individual can connect is dependent on many factors including:
  the quality of the wireless adapter;
  the distance from the access point;

  the number of users on the system; and
  the intensity of all users combined downloading at a given moment.

Davisville Management Company does not guarantee 24/7 Internet availability and does not make any representations of an end user’s Internet access speed because factors affecting WiFi access speed vary substantially with the conditions described above.

Recently, Fountain Circle has undergone a change of management. The new management is cold, vicious with their parking violation stickers, and bent on enforcing the rules and regulations. Their unfriendly manner of conducting business along with constant scrutiny has led to a housing situation that does not feel like a home. It doenst feel like they want us here or that they value our tenancy, and for this we are searching for a new house to live in next year. The townhomes are large and dont cost much to heat, but for me at least, the cons outweigh the benefits.  Users/DanLivin
  I agree with you completely Dan.  Recently they charged us $110 for a broken window caused because the shoddy lock on our door jammed at 3 in the morning and we couldnt get into my apartment.  A good friend of mine got 12 stitches and the women in the office were real jerks about it.  They also towed my car despite my having lived there for 2 years.  Cost me $300.  Moving to west Davis next year.  Users/ZacMorris

20060713 22:30:57 nbsp This is a horrible place to live. There is basically a new manager in the office every week and they all appear to be cold and unconcerned about the welfare of their residents. The management strictly enforces parking, yet it may take them as long as 2 weeks to fix any maintenance concerns. When I moved in the cleaners had hardly finished, showing signs of a halfassed paint job. My favorite quote from one of the many managers this year after they found a bunny in our apartment (a violation of our lease): I dont know how to evict anyone right now, but TRUST me, I will learn if you dont get that bunny out in 3 days!!! Dont be fooled, the apartments look nice, but they arent wort it!!!!! DONT LIVE HERE! Users/AbbyLawson

20060714 12:33:42 nbsp Oh, fountain circle, I could right a novel on all the ways you tormented me over the past three years.  They didnt replace the barf stained carpet before we moved in, and the day we moved in they didnt have our apt ready so we had to sit outside with all of our stuff until 10pm.  About a year ago the drainage pipe in the celing broke flooding the entire upstairs causing thousands of dollars worth of damage to our stuff.  They only agreed to pay damages after we threatened to sue them.  The foundations are shifting, which means doors dont shut, and windows arent sealed well, and there are cracks all over the walls and celing, that they enjoy painting over to fix.  Its been interesting I can tell you that, but despite all of this, its been a roof over my head for a reasonable price and a great location, so it all depends on what you can put up with. Users/ShaunaMcKellar

20060909 01:37:10 nbsp Another exresident here.  I echo the sentiments of my neighbors.  Our doorknob fell off and they took forever to fix it.  When we moved in, the upstairs bath leaked through the kitchen ceiling.  We lived there for two years and the leak wasnt properly fixed until three months before we moved out.  Different management personel told us conflicting info.  They were ready to charge me $300 aquarium deposit for my frogs tank, which contained less than three cups of water at any given time.  Once they even lost our rent check and were ready to charge us another rent payment + late fee until I brought them the copy of my deposited check.  To be fair, for simple fixes (eg replacing the window blind rod) the maintenance was prompt, and the apartment layout itself was nice.  Personally I like the more homelike vibe of my new, smaller apartment complex, even though its an older building and farther away from grocery shopping.   Users/SallyHensel

20060911 13:41:20 nbsp This place is AWFUl! The large rooms are not worth the astronomical security deposit. The apartment we were supposed to move into was unhabitable becuase of mold. There were leaks in the ceiling and the management turns over every three months. The new managment in particular has been the worst. They are rude, condesending and unprofessional.  Its hard for me to take the people that work there seriously when they could care less about their tenants.  Users/KimmyThomas

20061209 23:02:22 nbsp Truthfully, I lived here for a short period of time under a sublease, but I also experienced some awful shit, and my roommates told me horror stories as well.  I would highly suggest living elsewhere, if you can manage it. Users/LizzEhrenpreis

20070223 18:47:41 nbsp Oh cmon, its not that bad.  The manager is nice and I havent had any problems with the place (except they had to get the carpet cleaned before move in).   Users/WaylandLee

20070226 23:43:52 nbsp This place is horrible. There is a lack of parking and if you dont get back by 6pm, youll have trouble finding a spot. The walls are thin and you can hear when neighbors music and even hear them doing it. THey are slow to fix things and one time, they told us to to ACE Hardware and fix it ourselves. They are only nice to you before you sign the lease and during the holiday party. Other than that, have fun dealing with them. Users/JohnWong

20070421 10:47:25 nbsp Actually, i really like living in fountain circle. The maintenance is prompt and the managers are very nice to me! FC is in a great location and i agree with the previous comment....its not that bad! Users/JessicaL

20071001 12:29:10 nbsp I wholly disagree with the irresponsible comments below regarding Fountain Circle and their management team. I suddenly moved to Davis for graduate research last year and was stranded with no place to live. Fountain Circle was the only apartment complex to go out of their way to set me up with a tenant seeking a sublet, and processed the paperwork with a day. I moved in and it was an excellent experience! The whining and sorrow about bent window screens and management dress code is pathetic. If a tenant cant cope with some of the challenges of an apartment, then live with your mommmy. The staff is awesome and very professional when faced with REALLIFE problems and dilemmas, and they dont show compassion when they tow your exgirlfriends dads cousins broken down Impala from which he sells cocaine. You shouldnt have a bunny, or family of twelve, or anything else prohibited... you know this going into the lease. I have lived in over 5 different apartment complexes during my college career and this was by far the best!!!!! The units are very nice, and once again, the staff, as uniformly blasted below is fantastic! They are approachable, welleducated people (which certainly does not apply to the people posting the comments below) and go beyong ordinary efforts to keep the peace and happiness in the complex. Excellent experience for the time spent!    Users/MarcV

20080222 16:53:29 nbsp HORRIBLE PARKING!!! especially past 10 at the beginning of the week. Its ridiculous; I thought youre supposed to match the number of spots you have to the number of permits you give out. The price is relatively high too ($1400 for 2BDRM in a renewal contract). Now the good things: very convenient location, friendly management team(occasionally), bigass units. Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20080410 13:50:20 nbsp THE ROOMS ARE HUGE...the four infamous words that lured us into..hell. Do not be fooled by the extravagant size of the apartment. For every extra squareinch found, you will be cursed with equal amounts of management flaws.  Common courtesy, friendliness, and a social atmosphere, are among the few finest qualities that this complex LACKS. Managers are rude, prude, and put us in a bad mood. Parking permits are strictly enforced unless you want the orange sticker of death...that never comes off your windows. Barbqs not allowed in the patio, neither is furniture..and you have to keeep it sparkly clean or you get notices.  The apartments are located very oddly which limits sunlight from entering the apartment.  So i guess, if youre looking for snobby attitude, constant maintenance issues, and a crap place to live..fountain circle is your best bet.

...do NOT live here.  Users/abbynormal

20080410 13:50:38 nbsp If you are looking for an apartment complex with horrible management, parking, etc., then I would recommend Fountain Circle. I have lived here for a year now and definitely dont plan on living here again. Management constantly messed up our rent, saying that we didnt pay..when in actuality we did!! They took it so far as to sending us eviction letters. Our garbage disposal wasnt fixed until two months after we sent out a work order. And if you plan on getting a parking spot, dont count on it past 10 pm.

DONT LIVE HERE! Users/joannbaker

20080421 01:40:33 nbsp this is the worst place in the world to liver. the management is vicious. they are horrible people and they talk to you like your retarded. they dont care about anything you say and they have the worst attitudes. the person who originally showed the apt to me was nice but laura and the old lady are horrible. if i knew about the other two i would never have moved in. parking is impossible. DO NOT LIVE HERE. the pool is the size of a jacuzzi and the jacuzzi is the size of a tub. i can hear my neighbors talking through the wall but most off all THE MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if u live hear u will definitely regret it. dont get tricked like me.  Users/soodaymhungry

20080825 21:13:17 nbsp just wondering...has anyone ever filed a suit against fountain circle? and does anyone know how much gets deducted from the security deposit? me and my roommates are wondering if a full paint job is really necessary for normal wear and tear after two years of living in HELL.  Users/bag

20080829 14:12:40 nbsp DONT LIVE HERE!!!  This place is out to get your money.  They came and did a premoveout inspection on our apartment and tried to tell us that the new UNUSED microwave was dirty and needed to be cleaned.  They are out to find any excuse to keep your deposit, which is about 1.5x the first months rent.  Probably the highest price for a deposit in town.   Users/JessicaAdams

20080830 22:27:26 nbsp First order of business: DONT LIVE HERE!!
Pros: This is the cheapest four bedroom apartment in Davis as far as I know and the location is great.
Cons: Management is what I would call ineffectual and apathetic AT BEST. Maintenence is loud and will often do their work at very questionable times (jackhammering at 8:00 AM anyone?). The apartment is poorly made (AKA a shithole). They will come up with exciting, creative ways to screw you out of money.

I know this last point is true for most Davis apartments, but FC really shines in this regard. Some gems from the fine management at Fountain Circle:

Their insistance on charging me a $25 fine for not turning in my parking permit. I only didnt do it because my car was TOTALED ON THE FREEWAY. They then suggested I could have taken it out after the accident. As if my first thought after a near death experience is to remove my parking permit sticker?!
Failing to notice three or four broken items in the apartments walkthrough at the beginning of the year. Then saying that it wasnt a walkthrough, but a courtesy check and that doesnt count.
Telling us our carpet was going to cost $750 to fix one minute, then $1200 the next.
Putting a towing sticker on my friends car after only being parked there for thirty minutes.

Fk this place. Dont give them a red cent.  Users/SteveKent

20081107 16:49:26 nbsp Living in the apartments isnt nearly as bad as the management.  It is seriously composed of the biggest group of bitches in the entire world. Dont live here. Users/alphalau

20081123 01:10:54 nbsp DONT PICK HERE IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE!!!
Pros: quiet neighborhood, big rooms, provides covered parking. Generally very friendly electrician/repair workers (except that one fat dude that puts on his fisher hat all the time. he bitches a lot).
Cons: They have people using leaf blowers in the morning! EXTREMELY bad dish AND cell phone reception (3 bars under MU basement turns into 1bar/none reception in my room). Parking spots are definitely insufficient; no assigned spots. They dont allow dogs (although I heard barkings sometimes). High rent; high deposit, which by all means they would try to keep (Im still living here but I know, because theyre trying to charge me for tiny defections in the apartment that existed before I moved in but I didnt report cuz I didnt think it was a problem). Despite the recent change in the management team, theyre still not friendly (not as bitchy as the ones before tho). Exercise room is tiny, and way past due for renovation! Theyre supposed to lock the office building+swimming pool+exercise room at 10pm, but its all locked already when I went at 9.30pm. Extremely tiny swimming pool. They bitch at what you put in your own front yard!!! WTF man?! What I put wasnt even something that would affect anyone unless they freaking peek into my front yard. In fact, it was only some bike parts!!!  Ive been in this place for couple years already and Im VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PLACE, especially with the management team (not only the ones that are sitting in the office, but the people behind them, too). See, I dont even use Daviswiki that often but Im so pissed! DONT TRY THIS APARTMENT!!!
 Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20081123 01:14:50 nbsp And SteveKents comment was so damn true Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20081203 17:04:06 nbsp I dont understand why everyone says that Laura is such a bitch and all that, she is always pleasant to me when I go in the office.  Ive never had any problems with her. Users/NicoleHuff

20090118 21:15:04 nbsp Alright...I dont know about you guys, but im allergic to cats...and theres been cats roaming around here at night.  It would follow me home and I would have to get my housemates to get rid of it.  I dont recommend this place for people who dislike pets or cats.  Even though, this place doesnt actually allow cats...theyre all over the place. Users/AlphaX187X

20090813 22:59:45 nbsp Alpha  they dont allow pets, but the cats are owned by MANAGEMENT.  Theres a black cat that is always running into peoples apartments... hypocritical much?

Also, I would rather move in a week later and have them actually take the time to clean my apartment and properly fix everything before I move in.  Also, who painted these apartments?  Had they ever heard of painters tape?  They obviously just took a paint spray machine and blasted the place: including tops of closets, on the wall trim, and parts of cabinets. Some of the apartments have newer appliances, carpeting and tile, but some dont. The pool is a joke, why waste the money building one at all?  The study nooks were a dumb idea, I dont know why they didnt just make them whole rooms in the first place. Users/JesBisagno

20091022 14:11:58 nbsp I agree with the complaints above.  I hate the manager, Laura is a total bitch.  She acts kind during the move in day when my parents and friends are around.  When I go to her office ask her to fix a leak, and a cracked wall.  It is NEVER fixed.  She lives in the complex and owns a cat, but tells you no pets allowed, because the management doesnt allow it. A Total hypocrite!! Users/tmrsg11

20091022 22:58:34 nbsp I was not at all pleased with their handling of the deposits.  They assessed our apartment a light clean and proceeded to take half of the deposit. Users/EliYani

20091104 15:49:34 nbsp I have been living here for a little over two months, and I have to disagree with some of the negative comments. I realize that I have only lived her since the beginning of September, so there is time for my opinion to change.

Every time I go into the front office, Laura is very friendly toward me. She makes a point of trying to remember mine and my boyfriends names and even which unit we live in. Yes, the apartment had a lot of things wrong with it when we moved in. Just yesterday, we complained about some of the things that we hadnt noticed right away. Maintenance was sent over later that day. They came in again today to finish up what they started and ended up fixing a door for us that we had not even complained about. Parking (when you have a permit), isnt that bad. The spots seem to be variable in size, which is strange, but weve always been able to find at least one open parking space, even if it is far away from our unit.

The only complaints I might have against living here is that the laundry facilities are far away and we arent allowed to have pets. However, the unit we chose is very far away from the front office, and that is no fault of Fountain Circle. I am sad that I cant own a cat, but I knew this when I signed the lease, so now I have to live with that.

It is true that I have not yet had to deal with trying to get my deposit back, but so far, Fountain Circle has been a great place to live for me. It seems like it may be one of those cases where only the people who have something to complain about have been commenting. Users/pwong

20091208 01:53:10 nbsp I also have to disagree with the negative comments. Ive lived here for about a year, and the management is real nice. Laura is friendly and understanding of students schedules. One time some of us were at the study lounge at a crazy hour in the middle of the night, and she did not mind. Maintenance is also friendly and quick to fix up anything, including things we do not notice or ask for. They also serve yummy free food during the Thanksgiving holiday party!

I love the convenience to Safeway and the G/J bus stops right outside our apartment. Quiet neighborhood with plenty amenities nearby; no complaints. Users/veggielover

20091219 22:17:08 nbsp I dunno, Ive been here for over a year and its really not that bad. They repair our stuff straightaway no questions asked. But then again I havent moved yet so I dont know what theyll do to our safety deposit.
Haha its pretty true that they have leafblowers and shit early in the morning, but I think that only affects you if you live DOWNSTAIRS  i live upstairs and ive never been bothered by them. Maybe im just a heavy sleeper.
And I want that cat back. I miss seeing Midnight this yr. Users/councilman

20100315 14:19:35 nbsp If you plan to have a car, avoid this apartment. Parking here is anarchy: jerks taking up 2 spots with one car  happens all the time; no surveillance camera in the parking lot; WORSE YET! parking spots are EXTREMELY short, and on top of that there are tons of mofos in the lot without a permit and you cant do shxt about it. Yeah. so at night, if bunches of cars without permit just magically take up your valuable parking lot, the best you can do is to hope for the towing guy would come by. Perfect! Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20100329 14:15:43 nbsp UPDATE: Now that Ive lived here longer, I have a few things to nitpick about.

One morning we woke up and our ceiling was leaking water from our upstairs bathroom. The maintenance staff was very friendly and came in right away, but it was still pretty shocking to see. We now have a bunch of holes punched into our kitchen ceiling.

There are a few policies I disagree with the management on:
On a trip home (we live roughly four hours away), my boyfriends car broke down and we had to drive a different one up. Instead of issuing a temporary parking pass, or even a new one entirely, for the two or three weeks wed have a different car, we had to peel off the existing permit, bring in registration and transfer the permit to the temporary car, then transfer it back when we had our permanent car back again (again, after only two or three weeks).
This Saturday, I received a slip delivery slip. I know that the office isnt open on Saturdays, but when my boyfriend went to the front office, someone was there, so he tried to pick up the packages. They claimed that since the slip was in my name, he would be unable to pick them up. Well, I went in to pick up my packages today, and it turns out that one of them is his.

I still think that it is a generally nice complex to live in, but my boyfriend and I have decided to move to a petfriendly complex that also provides guest parking. Users/pwong

20100503 00:33:08 nbsp Surprise surprise. No parking on a Monday night, typical. Last time I didnt explained why I couldnt have someone towed the cars without permits. Well its because the towing company NEEDS the managers signature in order to tow a car here. And funny thing is, the manager office doesnt give a crap about such incidents at night  theres no way to inform them and they dont come and check. Next time I host a party, Imma just tell my friends its safe to park in the lot. Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20100809 15:13:24 nbsp Hey Davis Wikizens,
Does anybody have good advice concerning the premovein walkthrough?
Im planning on taking pictures (with timestamps) and writing up an apartment condition report sheet.
How should you ask the management to sign the condition report sheet?
This is my second year living in apartments, but my current landlord lady is quite reasonable, so I dont have to worry about her ripping me off.  (Which, I hear I have to be on my guard with the Fountain Circle management.  Any more comments on that?)

Thanks in advance for the help! Users/miniaggie

20100918 12:17:14 nbsp The management at this apartment is rude to its residents.  And they go above and beyond to gouge their residents on security deposit refunds, charging them for things that should be covered under normal wear and tear like paint.   Users/ChrisDietrich

20100924 15:03:37 nbsp NEW STUDENTS BEWARE! miniaggie, make sure you document and take pictures of everything!! Faucets, carpets, walls, showers, stove, oven, fridge, etc. Fountain Circle has nice apartments, big and spacious, nice appliances, their pool area is tiny. Their management is terrible though!. The women in the office are all business and not very friendly. The place seems nice enough when you live there, but when you move out you really regret it! They take advantage of unsuspecting students by charging you for everything they can get away with. My roommates and I spent two days straight cleaning, and they said everything was dirty afterward. The checkout process was rigged and they wouldnt allow us back in the apartment to show us what they were talking about. They took half of our $2000 deposit for reasons that were not justified. But because we didnt have pictures to prove anything, we could not argue with them. It is a way to legally rob you of your money and take advantage of you. DONT LIVE HERE unless you are wealthy and dont mind your money going into their pockets. Ive heard from many others who were charged immensely for cleaning and painting that when they went to look at the apartment with the new tenants in it, they hadnt even done the painting or cleaning that they were charged for. They outright lie in order to get your money. Check other websites, theyve been taking advantage of students for years. Users/SusanSteinwand

20110405 20:54:52 nbsp My oneyear lease is almost up, and Id like to throw my two bits in and say that living at Fountain Circle hasnt been too bad at all.  The management might not be the friendliest people in Davis, but it feels like they try hard to communicate with their residents, listen to what they want, etc., and they make an effort to offer us some niceties like Doughnut Fridays (learn to share, guys), raffles, and dinner/BBQs.  The only complaint that I have with them is that they didnt notify everybody in the complex when the recent burglaries happened, even though they could have (through their texting/email system). All of my housemates and myself have signed for another year (for which we received a $400 signing bonus, plus $25 or so off our rent every month next year.  Maybe on the meager side, but its better than nothing). Hopefully, I can report back next year with more good things to say : Users/miniaggie

20110726 14:34:46 nbsp I have lived at fountain circle for 3 years and overall it has been a good experience. There have been hiccups here and there the apartment has been a great place to live. Our place is very close to the bus stop and safeway which is convenient. Our rooms are large and nice. The walls are a little thin. Everyone seems to be friendly and safe. Not to many bugs of any kind. It is better than some of the other apartments i have been.
I recommend it. Users/gbutton

20111010 02:11:47 nbsp I have too many cons about this apartment. DONT LIVE HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING ROBBED FROM THE MANAGEMENT. I lived here for only a year and I regret it. I would totally put my direct deposit receipt here if i can. They charged me 1000 bucks for painting alone. No one paints their apartment every year WTF?? The complex was at its best original condition as when we first moved in. Theres nothing to paint, no one harassed the walls! I honestly feel like they and the painting company are in to this together to rob us students. Parking is ridiculous at night, dont expect to find a space after 10pm unless youre lucky (heads up for those ppl that goes to the ARC). You cant have mini fridges, iono how they expect everyone to use a single fridge. No pets allowed, not even a goldfish tank, but I heard one of the managers own a CAT don don don!!! What a hypocrite. Managements attitudes are like sht. Ohhh except near the end of spring, when they want to to continue living there. Walls are super thin, you hear your housies talk/snore. Fed up with this BullShT, too much to list.  Bottom line is, they will rip you off in any possible way. Worst complex ever lived. You will only get back about 1/3 of your deposit. I rather commute from Dixon than to live here again.

20111129 04:54:20 nbsp If people have not noticed all the reviews of apartment complexes say, Dont Live Here. This apartment complex is no worse than the next. I think the key to successful living situations is understanding your rental contract (oh yeah, read it!) and communication with the administrators when problems arise. I had some disagreements with the amount of security deposit returned to me. It took a bit of time , but I was able to get in contact with an administrator and all of my problems were resolved. So in conclusion, no place is perfect, but I think fountain circle is worth the cost. If you want a better apartment complex then you are going to pay way more in rent. Oh and P.S. you can have a pet you just have to pay more security deposit. Users/DrezE

20120120 18:39:12 nbsp I just got done renewing my lease here at Fountain Circle because Ive had nothing but positive experiences here. That may be due to the fact I dont purposefully break my window when Im locked out, park where I shouldnt, leave my apartment unlocked, or throw parties until the wee hours of the morning. The management has never harassed me; rather, Ive been sent cookies for no particular reason and have been treated like a friend since I walked in the door for the first time. The facilities are scrupulously maintained and have been compared to a nice vacation resort by visitors Ive had over. Unlike many of the other apartment complexes I visited while looking for places to stay, the pool here is kept debris free and sparkling clean. The apartments are also equipped for wifi, which is given to tenants free of charge. To be honest, it gets hard to connect during peak usage hours, but there are so many hotspots that one is always available,and it is not bad enough for me to pay 50 a month extra for my own connection from att! My only complaint is that our neighbors often have people over until the early morning and we can hear them partying at night on weekends. After thoroughly comparing all of the complexes with availabilities, I found that fountain circle provided more than your moneys worth in terms of overall quality and bonuses. The amenities are abundant, the manager is really awesome, the grounds look like a resort, and the units look new and fresh; no other complex offers that for a comparable price. If you are a student who wants to spend their time worrying about school rather the beauty and comfort of their apartment, fountain circle has what you want. If you are into the rambunctious party scene, there are plenty of frats near campus. Users/JohnSchreiber

20120215 21:38:01 nbsp DON’T LIVE HERE!!! Just touring the place has completely stopped my friends and me from wanting to live here. Sure, it looks nice, but from what I’ve seen, the management is truly HORRIBLE. My friends and I decided to take a tour early one Saturday morning almost two weeks ago. When we first arrived at the Fountain Circle office, we were ahead of a middleaged couple, but the management lady completely ignored us. The couple just wanted to look around to see where their kid would be living next year. We had to wait a long time for the management lady to come back to take us out onto the property. While waiting, I walked around the community clubhouse area, and went upstairs to look at the communal study area. When coming back down the stairs, I accidentally tripped. I cried out in pain, and after a few seconds, the management lady came to see what had happened. She offered me ice and walked away from me while I was crawling on the ground struggling to get back up on my feet. My friends had to come over and help me up and onto a couch. The lady never gave me the ice that she had offered, but instead walked back to her office and did not come to check on me and ask if I was okay even though my friends and I stayed on the property for over an hour to give me time to rest.  After a while, she came to see if we still wanted to tour the property even though I was obviously injured. Instead, she skipped over us, and took other groups out on tours. We FINALLY got a chance to take a tour, and I decided to hop along with the support of my friend. Even though I was clearly struggling to keep up, the lady sped through the property while taking us on tour. Later that evening, I ended up at Sutter Davis Hospital and found out that I had fractured my tarsal navicular bone in my left foot. I was given crutches and a cast and was told that it would take more than a month for me to heal. A few days later, I emailed both the Davisville Management Company and Fountain Circle Management to inform them of what had occurred and after a week, neither group has replied. BOTTOM LINE, if you value your health and common courtesy, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HELLHOLE!!! Users/Magic8Ball

20120221 15:41:57 nbsp In response to Magic8Ball...

I am sorry that you were not satisfied with your visit to Fountain Circle. I am concerned about how you perceived the events surrounding your visit and the resulting underlying anger in your words.

To the best of our ability, we show the units in the order that people arrive. Out of courtesy for our residents who have agreed to let us show their home, we do not show units until after 10AM because some of our residents like to sleep in, especially on Saturday mornings. Sometimes when people show up before 10AM, they walk around and look at the property until showing time begins. This can sometimes give the appearance that people are getting tours out of order and other times several groups arrive at the same time making impossible to show a unit to everyone at once. I wish I would have known and done whatever was needed to make you happy. I sent your communication to my supervisor who likes to make sure we do our best to keep everyone satisfied and happy. She was and continues to be in the hospital with a serious medical condition so I will do my best to respond to the issues myself.

The first thing I did was offer you assistance and/or an ice bag and I did not hear you say anything to me in response to my offer. I then alerted your friends so they could assist you. I showed them where the ice was located in case you decided you wanted some and asked them to check on you. Your friends did get the ice for you and told me you were okay. I felt like they knew you better and they were in a better position to assess your condition and provide what you wanted or needed. After returning from the tour, I asked if you and your friends were ready to go and you asked your friends to wait until you could go with them. I made sure there were plenty of cookies and coffee available and I thought it was nice of them to give you the extra time you wanted. I was happy to see you go on the tour of the property and it looked like you had made progress toward a pretty good recovery. Especially, since you were walking up and down stairs on the tour and seemed to be moving around fairly well considering the rough start.

I was glad to see you had the comfort and assistance of your three friends to help you and to be there to assess the situation. I believed them when they said you were okay and I did not know what else I could do to make you feel more comfortable. I regret that you had such a bad day and I sincerely apologize for anything I may have done to make you feel as though I didnt care about you as much as you needed and deserved. I really dont want you to go away feeling as though I dont care because of miscommunication combined with a series of unfortunate events. Please let me buy you a cup of coffee so we can discuss this and give me the opportunity to make it up to you. I would really like for us to end up on a positive note.

20120422 18:51:22 nbsp I must say, the management is great here. It may have changed a lot, but I started in 2010 and stayed here 3 years. We have had problems, but they were fixed almost immediately. Fan didnt work, within a week BOTH were replaced. Singlepane windows. In a month or so, they started replaced almost all of the apartments with double pain. Shower head broke. Fixed within a couple days. Door knob fell off. Fixed next day. They even became much more strict on nonresident parking after enough complaints about lack of parking. This place has only been nice to us and I love it here. Cheap, more room than most apartment complexes, and they started doing a bunch of bbq and chilli events. I want to live here for a few more years, if I wasnt graduating.

Also, there are not many bugs at all. We see a roach maybe once a month or so (which is very good for apartments in general)
