Four Seasons Gourmet, formerly known as Gold Town Chinese Restaurant, is a Chinese food Chinese restaurant. They opened sometime in September 2013, replacing Gold Town.

As of September 2013 they are owned and operated by a new set of folks who dont appear to have any relationship with any of the previous owners, and no longer have Taiwanese specific menu offerings.








20130915 16:04:48 nbsp Im just excited they have sour spicy cobbage. It sounds even more delicious than sour spicy cabbage! Users/JaneBF

20131124 14:00:07 nbsp I hit it up today. The place is kinda endearing with the typos. One on the sign that notify the problem to the chevron people if the bathroom needs work, and the other was MondayFried. Teehee.

That being said the food was pretty damn good. I perceived a massive portion of the general chicken. It was also all nice with its sticky candied goodness. BBQ pork fried rice was decent. I will report back when I try the walnut shrimp Users/StevenDaubert

reporting back on the walnut shrimp. The shrimp themselves were good, they split nicely and the sauce was slathered, could have been slightly more copious but it was good. The whole meal would have been great if it wasnt for the dealbreaker: 5 pieces of glazed walnuts total. 3 of those 5 pieces werent even full halves. How am I supposed to get some walnut on all 13 of the shrimp with only 5 partial pieces... What was even more irksome was the fact that the candied walnuts were fantastic and I really really desired more. ~SD
Post Script: There is a CC minimum of $10. This is slight miffing but I was intending on tipping a dollar anyways so it evened out on the $9 meal
