Fourth and Hope’s mission is to change lives; to provide a continuum of care for the hungry and homeless moving them from the street to stability in Woodland and Yolo County. We provide meals, shelter, rehabilitation, job training and, most importantly, what’s often a last chance for a real, sustainable life. We are a community safety net – and are in the business of helping people rescue themselves.
