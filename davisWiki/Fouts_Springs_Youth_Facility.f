Fouts Springs Youth Facility, sometimes referred as “Boot Camp,” is collaboratively operated by Colusa and Solano County Probation Departments. Yolo County contracts for a number of beds each month for Yolo County wards.

Fouts Springs is a Juvenile detention facility for boys located near the Mendocino National Forests Snow Mountain Wilderness in Colusa County.  It is a 2 ½ hour drive from Davis with access to the Ranch at the end of a nine mile narrow mountain road.  Due to its remote location, facility staff is required to live at the Facility.

Yolo County Probation will recommend placement at Fouts Springs when a court ward has a serious delinquent history, poses a present public safety risk and has not been amenable to prior treatment efforts. The Juvenile Court ultimately makes the final decision to order placement. The order is generally made as a sanction for ongoing offense behavior and a failure to respond to less restrictive therapeutic efforts.
 Phase I
This is the entrylevel phase. During this phase youth focus on learning acceptable living standards in a group setting to prepare them both physically and mentally to meet the standards necessary to complete their program.
Phase II
The focus of this phase is on leadership and responsibility including communication skills, goal setting, decision making and accepting responsibility for these decisions. High academic standards including vocational education as well as physical training are also a part of this phase.
Phase III
The primary focus of this phase is preparing for reentry into the community by concentrating on what was learned in phase I and phase II. This phase also deals with other reentry issues such as family relations, connections to AA and NA programs and the development of a 6month plan of action prior to release.

 Parent contact 

Parents can contact staff at any time, but wards are not allowed incoming calls.  However, wards can make one collect call when they arrive, one collect call per week during Phase I, two per week during Phase II and three per week during Phase III to preapproved phone numbers submitted at time of check in.

Wards can receive mail.

Parents can arrange for twohour visits by calling on Wednesdays to schedule visits for the following Sunday.  Only parents/guardians, attorney of record, clergy and sometimes grandparents can visit. No friends or siblings.
