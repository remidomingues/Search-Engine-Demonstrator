France Kassing is host of the weekly KDVS public affairs show Its About You. France is originally from Canada, which may be one of the reasons she is so thoughtful about progressive political issues. She has guests on her show from as far away as Iraq calling in and has also interviewed famous historian wiki:WikiPedia:Howard Zinn several times. Frances last name used to be Senecal, but in August of 2006 she married fellow KDVSer Dallas Kassing and took his surname.

France is friends with a startlingly diverse group of people in Davis. Coincidentally, she is quite an interesting and fun person to chat with.  Users/EricKlein
