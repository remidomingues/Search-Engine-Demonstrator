The Francis DuBois Benches Bench Memorials honors the memory of rice farmer and longtime Davis resident Francis DuBois.

It is next to the Bike Paths path running alongside West Pond.  Those resting on the bench can enjoy a view of the Butterfly & Hummingbird Garden, and also go for a walk and enjoy a lovely view of the Pond from the Greenbelt.
