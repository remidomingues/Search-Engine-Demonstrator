Francisco Lara is some guy who is a member of Internal Affairs Commission.  He was not a candidate in the Fall 2010 ASUCD Election, but he might be in the Fall 2014 ASUCD Election if enough people tell him to be.  Ryan Wonders thought he was going to be Armando Figueroas running mate in the Winter 2014 ASUCD Election, but he was wrong.

Users/MaxwellKappes is only marginally cooler than Francisco.
