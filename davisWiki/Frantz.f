20100228 10:58:19 nbsp Hey, Frantz, I cleaned up several of the entries you created called locksmith and set things so that your west sacramento wiki entry is your pirmary on and the davis is secondary, but that all other wikis just point to your west sac entry. The reason for this is to make things easier to maintain and keep from giving the appearance that you are just spamming every local wiki with a page about your business. Users/JasonAller
