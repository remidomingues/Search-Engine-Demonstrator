What is a Frat party?  Well, its a party thats put on by a Fraternities Fraternity.  These parties are not to be confused with Bro Parties, and are sometimes well orchestrated productions.  Lots of frat parties happen on Frat Row Frat row.

Frat parties are usually the type of party you see in movies: dudes dancing on tables, tons of kegs, loud ghetto music.  The beer always sucks at frat parties so dont expect to get drunk, unless of course you are in that Frat in which case you actually have a good time and know where the good stuff is.  Frats dont enjoy spending money on stuff for people that are gonna come in for the freebies.  

One of the advantages of being in a frat is that you can have the good stuff so the cheap crappy stuff is left for everyone else.
