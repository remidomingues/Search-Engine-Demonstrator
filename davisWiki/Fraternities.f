20060906 10:50:13 nbsp I suppose it means registered as in a http://spac.ucdavis.edu/programs/greek/fraternities.cfm registered student organization. Maybe some of the Greeks would know how this differs from having a charter on campus. I do know a Greek fraternity can lose its charter at a campus and Id assume it would have to somehow first be registered, no? Users/AlphaDog
