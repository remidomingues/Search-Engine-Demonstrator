20070409 22:26:47 nbsp Sorry for not getting back to you sooner  I only saw the comment today. Im still doing aikido, and like the style, though I dont really have any experience with other variants of aikido to compare it to.  Wed love to have you give us a try, and I expect Sensei Birts aikido is closer in spirit to Yoshinkan than many dojos (hes apparently considered further on the martial end of the spectrum, it that makes sense). Anyways, if you email me at (address redacted) I can go into more detail or answer any specific questions you have. And I should put you in touch with my housemates, who moved from Philadelphia a few years ago and used to study aikido. Users/JessicaLuedtke
