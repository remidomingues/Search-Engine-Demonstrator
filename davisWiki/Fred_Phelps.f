wiki:wikipedia:Fred Phelps, also known as that Godhatesfags guy, is pastor of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) in Topeka, Kansas. What does this have to do with Davis? Hes scheduled to come to Hillel House on February 5, 2010 at 23 PM to Preachers with signs protest. Hes also scheduled to be at Chabad from 910 AM on February 6, 2010. It should be interesting. Mark your Events Board calendars!

Hillel House respectfully requests that you DO NOT come to Hillel on Friday, Feb 5 for a counter protest against the Westboro Baptist Church, as no such counter protest will take place.

It is worth noting that the congregation (which is heavily composed of lawyers, including the now disbarred Fred Phelps himself) funds themselves through lawsuits against counter protesters provoked into physical action.  They literally make a living pushing buttons and suing people for their response.

   Hillel House has respectfully requested that no counterprotests take place. Users/arip

20100125 19:23:08 nbsp I am highly sympathetic, however I dont think creating a larger media circus is in your interest.  I think really the fact that this person recieves any attention at all is a national disgrace.  He should be ignored just like any other crazy street preacher or possibly laughed at at most.

Now if we went for an absurdit protest mocking Phelps and his ilk I would be in.  If anyone has any unique/clever ideas about how to do so Im all ears. Users/rfrazier
  This is Hillels plan for their event. If you would like to offer them suggestions I suggest you contact them.  I updated this page since the directors are not active on the wiki in order to help quell the madness. Users/OliviaY
 I really like this idea   Users/StevenDaubert > Hold a PhelpsaThon where for every hour Fred Phelps and his flock protest gays, people donate a small sum of money to a gay charity. Then, after hes done protesting, send him a thankyou card showing him how much money he raised for gay rights.
 I agree with rfraizer/Daubert. These guys already have attention. In my opinion, trying to deal with problems by ignoring them never seems to have the desired affect. I see these protests as a great opportunity for people of different beliefs to come together Christians, Jews, Atheists, everyone has a reason to come out and simply have a good time, making fun (nonhateful) signs, playing games (someone bring chalk and a kickball!) and singing songs. We dont have to choose between ignoring the situation and making it worse, why not use it as an excuse for love and celebration? (Of course I respect the opinion of the institution being attacked.)

20100131 18:14:06 nbsp The SF article is EXACTLY how these morons should be treated.  When you meet their absurd hate with hate, youre playing their game, and youre putting yourself on their level.

Hating them is in a way acknowledging their position as if its one formed by rational human beings, which it isnt.  Its insane, and the proper counter for insanity is a full blown discordian/dadaist freak out.

Come on people  are we really going to let ultraconservative whack jobs push our buttons?  The liberal/progressives have always been the kings of this game.  We can one up their madness with greater and funnier madness of our own. Users/rfrazier

20100131 20:08:37 nbsp If Hillel House doesnt want a counter protest I think their wishes should be respected. Users/rfrazier

Since you cant reason with these slapdicks, why not just thump a bible instead?

the Bible also says A bastard shall not enter the gates of heaven, even unto the 10th generation

Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time. Let your speech always be gracious (colossians)

20100205 02:50:53 nbsp These idiots should be completely ignored. Whenever this has happened in the past, they have moved on quietly since they thrive on media attention and without a counter protest, there is very little of it, they just get plain old bored.

Funny..  known of these guys for years and sat down today and watched a documentary on them by the bbc today ...  they truly are in a class all their own.. Sad. Users/WesOne
