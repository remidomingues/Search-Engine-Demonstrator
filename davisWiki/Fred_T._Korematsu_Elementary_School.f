The full name of this school is wiki:WikiPedia:Korematsu Fred T. Korematsu Elementary School at Mace Ranch. The length of the name is the result of a compromise between school board members who wanted to name it based on a local figure or geographical feature and members who wanted to name it after wiki:WikiPedia:Korematsu Fred T. Korematsu who was a civil rights leader. This http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id5a792a9e3b286ba3c72d628d223db169 article describes the decisions of the board.

The construction of the school has been controversial since before it was built. Residents of Mace Ranch were told that an elementary school would be built in the early 1990s but the school district did not purchase the land until 1995, there was no further funding until 2000 (voters rejected a $55 million school construction bond in 1997), and construction did not begin until 2005. During a 2002 school board meeting, members considered downsizing the school or possibly not building it at all.Footnote(Hudson, Jeff. Mace Ranchers say theyre just tired of waiting. The Davis Enterprise. 20060417)

Originally set to open in fall 2005, the opening was pushed back to fall 2006 due to budget cuts.Footnote(Hudson, Jeff. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2005/01/21/news/344new1.txt Mace Ranch school will open in 2006. The Davis Enterprise. 20050121)  Soon after opening plans were laid out for Korematsu to slowly to a K3, one grade level per year, the district had a sudden cut back in funding due to underenrollment of elementary students which resulted in the closure of Valley Oak Elementary School in June 2008 and the Korematsu opening was accelerated to open as a full K6 in the fall of 2008.

The 2006/2007 school year included only kindergarten and first grade, with second grade to be added for the 2007/2008 school year.

On March 20, 2007, the Board of Education voted 32 in favor of a resolution that would open Korematsu as a K6 school in the Fall of 2008.

Durring the summer before the 20112012 school year, Solar Power solar panels were installed that also double as shade in the parking lot.

  We have a beautiful K6 elementary school in a part of town where enrollment is not declining and were not opening it!  The problem is overcapacity in other parts of town.  Thats not likely to change since East (and South) Davis are the only parts of town that are remotely affordable for a family with young kids.  Its time to bite the bullet and do some elementary school consolidation in the parts of town where enrollment is declining.  DianeK

20101004 18:27:32 nbsp This is the best school ever. The teachers are really nice and thought the budget cuts made it hard, we went on some awesome field trips and put on some cool events. The playground is really nice and the classrooms are really big and there not all stuffy and old. The people are nice people and make it a really really really fun place to learn. Users/ViviS

20110124 21:49:40 nbsp Now in Junior High looking through the yearbook and old pictures, I miss this place so much! The campus environment is so nice, and there isnt any bullying, or harassment. The stuff you learn here is stuff that you would learn throughout life.  Users/Churro615
