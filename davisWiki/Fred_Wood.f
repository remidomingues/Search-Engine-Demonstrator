Fred Wood is the current  Student Affairs Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs at UC Davis.  Before serving in this position, he was Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies.

 He will be succeeding Interim Vice Chancellor Janet Gong as of August 1, 2007.  Theres a Dateline UC Davis article about his http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id9640 promotion, of course.

In an email sent on June 14, 2007 the Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef stated:

  I appreciate the many thoughtful comments we received about the candidates for Vice Chancellor â€“Student Affairs.  We had a strong pool.  After carefully reading and considering all of the comments, I have extended an offer to Fred Wood as the candidate who best meets our campus needs at this point in time.  Regental approval of new appointments must be obtained before any formal announcement can be made, and the next Regents meeting will take place in midJuly.  We look forward to being able to make a formal announcement at that time.

  I am grateful to Jan Gong for serving with distinction as Interim Vice Chancellor since January 1.

  Feel free to share this internal announcement as appropriate, and please join me in congratulating Fred on his new leadership role.

    Larry Vanderhoef Larry N. Vanderhoef, Chancellor
