Free Community Advertising is advertising that you can do when you dont have any money.  Many important groups and events are advertised for by just posting things around and word of mouth.

 Some ideas: 
  Flyers  check out Wiki Flyer.
  Mailing lists  SPAC has a list of student group contacts.  Ontopic solicitations only please.
  Chalking  Waking up super early and going into Wellman Hall Wellman and Olson Hall Olson to write messages on the chalkboards is likely worth it.  These messages (if placed properly on the inactive areas of the chalkboards) usually stay up for weeks.  There are some rules regarding chalking  what are they?  Can only SPAC groups post on these boards?  I can help make one of those fancy looking chalkboarding screens if anyone is interested, getting me up at 6am might prove more of a challenge.

  Leafletting  people often hand out quarter sheets at the Memorial Union.
