Free Cone Day is a Ben & Jerrys tradition that goes all the way back to 1979. When Ben and Jerry first started out in Vermont in the Spring of 1978, they decided that if their business lasted a year, they would have a Customer Appreciation Day where they would give away Living Cheaply free Ice Cream ice cream all day. The first annual free cone day was held on May 5, 1979, and the tradition continues every year with Free Cone Day falling sometime between midApril and early May. With the closing of our local Ben & Jerrys, cone day no longer qualifies as a Davis Holiday.

Free Cone Day 2010 was held on March 23rd. Customers gathered in a long line and ate the ice cream on the lawn in front of the store. Children played. Dogs  barked.  Cows sang in four part harmonies.  A splendid time was had by all.

Free Cone Day 2011 happened on April 12, 2011. The line was half as long as 2010, perhaps fewer people knew about it but it WAS posted on the DavisWiki Events Board this time. The weather was beautiful, perfect sunny, warm, not hot. KDVS DJs were playing records on the green. Chicagos Saturday in the Park could have been written that day. If it wasnt Tuesday, and if the ice cream wasnt free, that is. If you missed it, theres BaskinRobbins 31cent Scoop Night coming up on April 27, 5PM10PM.

I didnt actually go for the free ice cream.  The line was way, way insane. (There were more people past the right edge but my lens aint that good.  The line was also probably longer during actual daylight, too.)Users/AlexanderHo
 Interesting that there are no children in the picture!
 The children (and me!) were there right after school, between 34pm where there was no line, Woohoo! Dont wait until the college crowd came out when it gets dark Users/LeeY

 Reports from April 25^th^, 2006 
The line had 50 people at 1:30PM, 60 people at 2:00PM, grew to 120 people at 5:00PM. The line moved at 6 people/minute. (Figures averaged from 12 measurements). A number of people seemed to return to the end of the line for seconds, thirds, etc. The weather was perfect.

A few blue menu cards were passed along so that people could decide before they got to the serving station. Unfortunately, the tide kept moving the cards ahead (and a few cards disappeared). A much better method would have been to put a large sign on the lawn for everyone to read.

In years past, Ive had great experiences with the crowd for cone day, but I was disappointed this year. When I got in line by the Gap, there was a single girl infront of me.  She slowly budged people in with her until their their group totaled 8.  This was right at 5:00, and some of the people in her group were talking about how theyd already had two cones.  When the 8th person moved in, I finally complained and they acted as though I was the rude one.  sigh I wish people would be more considerate of others.  My cone, however long it took to get, was delicious.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

   Up to ten Ben & Jerrys employees were working at the same time to be sure the wait in line wasnt longer than ten minutes.

  KDVS was on site spinning mad tunes, with free buttons and stickers.

  Users/PopeChristof hacked the Ben & Jerrys Free Cone Day event. Having taken his Users/JessicaLuedtke wife and child to Ben & Jerrys to see what the line was like right at opening, Christof noted that there wasnt really all that much of a line. Christof then noticed that he lives less than 100 yards from Ben & Jerrys. Christof didnt have a lot to do on April 19th, so he decided to stock his freezer. Purely for the benefit of his wife and child, of course.  Oh, and to obtain some of the ingredients for a tasty Cherry Garcia beer float. (Made with Cherry Lambic Ale). 18 trips later, The line was long, the freezer had enough ice cream, and the day was hot.

In 2004 the KDVS KDVS Sound System spun records all day long and, as a community sponsored organization, collected over a hundred dollars in donations. Over 6,000 Discounts and Freebies free servings of ice cream were scooped. In 2005 the staff of Ben & Jerrys will plan a lot of crazy fun stuff as well as give away lots and lots of free ice cream.

(In 2004) Free Cone Day helped ensure that I registered to vote!  Users/KenjiYamada
