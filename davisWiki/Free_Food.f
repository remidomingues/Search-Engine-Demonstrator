This page was inspired by a poor soul in Safeway that was buying a tiny package of rosemary, when unbeknownst to her, there was rosemary growing out in the parking lot and all over town. Description to come soon, (anyone want to take a stab at it?) Also see Dumpster Diving.

Free Food
  CalFresh CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps)  For qualified lowincome individuals and families.
  The Pantry is a food bank located in the basement of Freeborn Hall that gives away free food to UC Davis students in need. The program is supported by donations and volunteers.
  Evaluating Grain Products Study Another way to get food is by participating in studies like this one, where food is given out free!

 Free Meals 
Also see Homeless Resources.
  Davis Community Meals  Free and open to all, student or otherwise.
  Food Not Bombs  Weekly meal, currently cooked at the On Campus Coops Tri Coops.
  The Sack Snack  A free sack lunch from Davis Community Church, Monday through Friday, from 11:30AM to 12:00 noon.
  Lots of food gets left on plates at restaurants after the diners leave. A lot of this food is still perfectly good and will get thrown out. You could consider sitting down and eating it before the busboys clean it up. This works best at casual places like Dos Coyotes and Plutos.
  Participate in a Research Studies research study.

 Free Fruit 
Davis is an agricultural town, with a lot of fruit trees and edible landscaping in town and all over the UC Davis campus. Heres where to look.
  Visit http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hlen&glus&ieUTF8&msa0&msid101873520512973484071.0004444583b8984b4b0eb here for a google map of fruit trees in Davis.  The map is public and collaborative, so please add trees if you know of their locations.  (You must have a google signin.)  Use pushpins to mark the locations of trees.  If the tree is on private property, please indicate that in the note, and only mark it after getting permission from the owner first.
  Someone may have some Surplus produce to offer to drop off. Or you may be able to offer to pick some up.
  Figs  Grows in several places.  A couple small trees behind the Vegetable Crops greenhouse off of Hutchison Drive Hutchison on UC Davis campus. Also, there are a few trees between Olson Hall and Voorhies Hall. (The tree above the bike racks at the Davis Food Coop is a fig tree, but the City insisted its fruit be sterile, so that a ripe fig would never drop on a parked car.)
  Berries  Blackberries grow in many of the wilder areas around the edge of town. Probably other berries, too. The little strawberries youll commonly see growing around downtown are decorative. They may or may not be poisonous, but regardless, they dont taste good and arent worth picking.
  Sort of free  although you have to pay for your final basketful of fruit forage at Impossible Acres, you can eat while you pick. Until they start weighing people before and after they go picking, stomached fruits carry a price equal to only the amount of time youll spend being shunned by local people who dont think you should steal from small, local family farms.
  There are apple trees along segments of the South Davis Bike Path. There is also an apple tree that hangs over the fence at the southwest entrance to Slide Hill Park, which produces lots of felled fruit.
  There is at least one grape vine on the fence alongside the Russell bike path west of the main campus, as well as other places around town.
  Tons of delicious golden seedless grapes  hanging over the eastbound bike lane on Covell, right past Covell & Sycamore. Ripe in late September.
  Tomato Trucks Road tomatoes are free in the summer months. These are tomatoes that fall off the tomato trucks while in transport.  Usually plentiful around on/off ramps, and at bends on county roads.
  The loquat trees in the south courtyard of Cruess Hall  fruit seasonally around late spring.
  The J Street Coop has some fruit trees (plums, kumquats, cherries, figs, persimmons and apricots). Feel free to taste whatever is ripe but please dont take lots since the residents like to eat fruit too.
  Pomegranate trees line the rear parking lot at Chaparral Apartments in north Davis  fruit seasonally around September.
  Theres a few pomegranate trees with complementary pavement for cracking the things on the Covell Greenbelt.
  Cook the pomegranates with recipes from http://www.pomegranateworld.com Pomegranate World.
  The apricot trees between the Chemistry Building and Everson Hall  fruit seasonally around late spring.
  An Orange trees orange tree has fruit yearround just south of Parking Lot 10 (intersection of A St. & Hutchison Dr.). To get the fruit in the winter, you may have to do some Tree Climbing tree climbing.
  The wiki:Wikipedia:Prickly_Pear Prickly Pear cactus has edible branches/pads (called nopales) as well as an edible fruit in the summer (the pear). Dont take too many nopales, as these cacti grow very slowly. Be sure to watch out for tiny, hairthin barbed thorns. (Use two forks to pluck these fruit without turning your hand into a pincushion.)  Theyre found in the Arboretum, behind Walker Hall, and at Cactus Corner.
  Ornamental plum trees are common and easy to spot with their dark purple leaves and bark. When ripe in the late spring/early summer they are rather tasty. It takes a little patience to spot purple fruit against a backdrop of purple leaves and branches.
     Theres a row of ornamental plums along the west side of F Street between 8th Street 8th and 9th Street 9th Streets.
  For students taking Plant Biology 143  Evolution of Crop Plants, a free Crop of the Day starts off every class meeting.
  Many university departments, especially Pomology, Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry, and others dealing with plants, have copious amounts of plants that have been used in research experiments.  These are usually safe for human consumption, and often go home with University employees or go bad.  If you get in good with a professor or TA, (s)he might be able to hook you up.
  Walnuts Walnut trees grow on the west side of Birch Lane School, on the roadside of the staff parking lot.  Dont go between 8am and 3:30 on weekdays you might agitate the administration by being an intruder on campus.

 Free Herbs 
Many herbs can be found in the herb garden inside the Student Experimental Farm, they are free to pick but please make sure the plants will survive.
  California Bay  a spice often used in corned beef and mulling spices, leaves from this tree have a powerful flavor and aroma. The Arboretum at UC Davis has bay trees growing there. (Location, anyone?)
  The Student Experimental Farm features an culinary and medicinal herb garden, complemented by a few fruit trees.
  Mints Peppermint  Great for tea and mint juleps, this plant grows wild in the EC Gardens. Want to grow your own? Pull a stalk with roots attached and transplant  its practically a voracious weed.
  Rosemary  this plant is so ubiquitous as landscaping its not even funny. But for good quality stuff, try the EC Gardens, where it grows tall and wild.
  Mints Spearmint  Great for tea, seasoning lamb, and garnishes, find it growing wild in the EC Gardens. Grows most prolifically near water spigots.
  Lavender  Good for tea, potpourri/essential oils, decoration. There is a huge bush with plenty of surplus at the EC Gardens, and several bushes in the Arboretum.

 Other Free Edible Plant and Plantlike Material 
  Walnuts Walnut trees grow all over Davis. They look like golf ball sized green balls, not the walnuts you find in the store. This is the outer husk, which needs to be peeled off (and stains like crazy!).
  Many roads such as Russell Russell Blvd are lined with Olive trees, which frequently fall to the ground and pop under bike tires. Olives on the UC Davis campus are pressed to make UC Davis Olive Oil olive oil, rather than just have the groundskeepers dump them.
  Many varieties of edible Mushrooms grow around Davis, especially in wooded areas. The shaggy mane mushroom, Coprinus comatus, is particularly delicious deep fried in egg batter and bread crumbs. They are said to be seen around the rec pool and Plant and Environmental Sciences Building after some Rain rains. Id advise staying away from the white mushrooms that look like button mushrooms. Although Agaricus campestris and Agaricus bitorquis are delicious wild species, mother nature decided to toss in the mildly poisonous Agaricus californicus on the west coast, just to annoy us. Make absolutely sure you know what youre looking for before eating any, since mushrooms can be very poisonous.
  Between the Chemistry Building and Everson Hall, one can find a chestnut tree.

 Free Beverages 
  See Free Beer
  At The Avid Reader, occasionally you can get free, small cups of coffee  probably just a winter thing.
  Free coffee can be found at Trader Joes and both free coffee and Tea can be found at Cost Plus

 Free Prepared Food 
  Around 2pm, check out the Cafes little coffee bar at the MU bus station. They close around 3pm, and tend to dispense free coffee and bagels a little bit before then. Especially if Users/JillBenciWoodward is working that day.
  Is that what that thing is? Ive never seen it open in my two years at UCD.
  Free breadsticks at Cenarios Pizza. Limit one per day using this coupon. http://www.cenariospizza.com/FredBread.html
  Graduate Student Association has CoffeeBagelDonut Day free bagels, donuts, fruit and orange juice every Friday for graduate students at their office near the Silo. Youre supposed to be a graduate student, but I dont think they actually check although undergrads might stick out due to their ability to talk to normal people and lack of dark circles under their eyes. GSA also hosts happy hours on the last Thursday of every month. These have free food, but sometimes theyre so crowded its just not worth it.
  Attending lectures and seminars will often get you free food. I once went to a talk on wine that involved free tastings.
  Art show opening receptions tend to have all sorts of free snacks.
  Taqueria Guadalajara Guadalajaras has FREE tortilla chips and salsa! Go with a friend who is buying something so you dont come off as a complete cheapskate.
  The food science department often has free taste testings where they ask you deep and meaningful questions about the texture of a cookie.

Downtown:
  Many vendors at the Farmers Market offer free samples, including:
   Kettle Pop
   East & West Gourmet Afghan Food
  The Davis Food Coop often offers cooking demos with free samples

This page gives me the creeps, especially the one setting down at a strangers table after they have left to finish whats there. You might catch the hibby jibbies
 Not everybody in the world is so privileged to entertain that mindset. When you are extremely poor and hungry, the hibby jibbies are the last thing on your mind.

20120907 01:40:56 nbsp Somehow, I managed to mess up the Google Free Food map. I have no idea how I did it, and dont know how to fix it. There are three markers in the Pacific Ocean, obviously where they shouldnt be. Someone please fix it! Im so sorry! Users/caiyuemei

20131127 14:26:17 nbsp The chestnut tree between Everson Hall and the Chemistry Building is a horse chestnut. Horse chestnuts are poisonous. There is however a hazelnut tree planted right next to it. Users/TroyShea
