Free piles are a special bit of Davis magic. People put their unwanted belongings, such as clothing, books, kitchen gadgets, food, furniture, or anything else, out on the curb, and they conveniently disappear in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Free piles are not just onetime items or even piles of stuff left near the sidewalk. They are yearround depositories/exchange areas for people to leave and take nolonger wanted items.

Items typically are disposed of if they arent taken after 7 days.

Transient Free piles frequently occur after yard sales and during Moving Day moveout time. It never hurts to place a paper sign marked FREE on your item, just so it is clear to everyone that it is OK to take.

Free piles can be found throughout residential areas of Davis, they are more common in some areas than others. They are particularly found in older neighborhoods. Sometimes free piles are advertised on Craigslist or Freecycle (though this is against the Freecycle rules).  Other times theyre unadvertised.

In apartment complexes, the area near the Dumpster Diving dumpsters frequently ends up being a de facto free pile for items that are still useful.

 Free Pile Etiquette 
  Use caution when taking items that are not specifically marked as free. If in doubt, ask first.
  Conversely, free pile creators should label piles as free if possible, so as not to contribute to confusion.
  Take what you will use, leave what you dont for someone who will.
  Leave the free pile at least as neat as you found it.
  Dont make noise if its after dark; neighbors may be sleeping.
  Free pile creators should find alternate disposal for items not taken within a reasonable period of time.
  Avoid leaving items such as books when its about to rain  people are unlikely to sort through a pile of sopping wet stuff.
  Large items such as mattresses often cause more trouble than they help others. The rules of piles vary.
