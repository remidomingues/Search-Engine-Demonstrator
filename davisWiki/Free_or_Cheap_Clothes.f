Free Clothing
Free clothing can often be obtained through Craigslist and The Freecycle Network, though youll often get a huge bag of clothes that may not fit or not be your style.  Take what you can, and then pass on the rest to someone else.  Another tip is to look at the Garage Sales listings on Saturdays or Sundays and cruise by the sale locations at the end of the day, after the sale has ended.  Frequently, the remnants of  unpurchased yard sale goods will be left on the driveway with a free sign, with hopes that they wont have to bother dragging their castoffs to the SPCA Thrift Store.

 Tshirts

 Making your own clothes 
Theres moreorless two routes you can take when making your own clothing.  One is to actually create the material yourself.  The most popular way of doing this is Knitting knitting, though yarn isnt the cheapest thing in Davis and its labor intensive.  The other is to get Living Cheaply cheap clothing, rip it up, and get creative.  Without much work you can combine multiple pieces of clothing together, borrowing fabric from unwanted things.  You can come up with some really interesting and fun designs like this.

Another option is to just take regular old clothes and place a design on them by means of a stencil, silkscreen, or ironon transfer.  If you go with a stencil youll have trouble getting it on the shirt, but you can try spraypainting it on (which often works well, but doesnt look clean if not done properly).  Silkscreening is very effective, but harder to approach if youre new.  Luckily, a class is offered at the Craft Center if you want some help along the way.  You can purchase just about all of the materials needed to silkscreen at the UCD Bookstore  including a wooden frame that requires only minimal assembly.  Ironon transfer looks professional (from a distance), and is really easy to do (you can just buy paper for a standard computer printer, or buy premade designs such as letters).  However, ironons typically feel stiff and uncomfortable, and dont tend to age very well (they can peel off or flake away).

The UC Davis Bookstore bookstore sells a chemical that allows you to print on fabric using your inkjet printer. However, you cant put your whole shirt through the printer, only what you can iron onto a piece of wax paper. Fabric treated this way doesnt feel stiff or uncomfortable and looks pretty good. I dont know how long it lasts.
