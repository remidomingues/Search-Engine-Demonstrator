Freeline Skates are not connected to each other and do not have a board, just one small rectangular deck for each foot. There are two wheels under each skate, set in line with each other and mounted in a rigid fashion the wheels do not swivel, tilt or turn.

There are only two known Freeliners in Davis. One of them can be found riding in North Davis during the afternoons. Wave hi!
