Fremont Court is north of East Covell Boulevard and east of Pole Line Road.  Covell Village was proposed to go in on the other side of Pole Line Road. All of the residences here are part of a McKeon Condominiums condo association.

 As of August 6th, 2012, the L Bus Line no longer serves Fremont Court.
