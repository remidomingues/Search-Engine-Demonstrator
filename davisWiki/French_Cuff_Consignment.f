20100817 13:05:02 nbsp French Cuff is now in Davis, too!  I visited Davis for the first time a month ago and the store owner said they had just opened that location.  Their clothes, shoes, purses.... they are fantastic!  Be prepared to spend money because everything there is a find! Users/SteffanyBarrus

20101123 14:18:31 nbsp The Davis location of French Cuff puts all other Davis consignment stores to shame. The selection is amazing  the first time I went in I stayed for over an hour  and clothes are grouped by color/type, not size, so a bit of digging is required to yield treasures. But there are indeed treasures to be found, and some of them are real bargains.

I wish Id known, when I went on my first shopping spree, that as part of their customer recognition your receipt will have a coupon attached for your next purchase. A good strategy: buy what you need the first time and come back with that coupon for more (and there will be more  new stuff arrives all the time).

Most of the time Corey is there; shes warm, friendly and helpful. She really knows her stuff, but is also very chatty. In fact, it can take a while to extricate yourself from a conversation with her  but at least Corey provides ample personal contact with her customers... which is sorely lacking in some of our local stores (Im talkin bout you specially, Nestware)!

20120430 13:24:22 nbsp While Ill admit, I dont have any experience shopping here, consigning here was a complete waste of time. I brought in 30+ excellent pieces (some designer, some professionally made and some mainstream), clean, pressed and excellent condition. The woman setting up the account hardly spoke to me and started sorting the clothes by stacking them on the counter in a big pile. Once I realized what she was doing, I asked, Are those the ones youre not going to take? She said, Yes, we dont take Gap. To be honest only one or two items were Gap the rest were Ann Taylor, Chicos, etc... I quickly realized that she was only going to take about 4 items so I strolled around to see what other labels they did take for next time. What was the first tag I saw? Gap. The next? Gap. I wanted to walk out, but thought Id give it a chance. After 3 months none of the items she selected sold (two vintage items and two Laundry by Shelli Segal). When I went to pick my items up after my consignment period, she handed all 4 of them to me wrinkled and shoved into a Target bag. Thanks. Users/DebWestergaard
