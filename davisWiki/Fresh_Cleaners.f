20081202 11:25:54 nbsp Ive been very happy with this place.  They got spots off of an ivory wool coat and now it looks spotless and they worked very hard trying to get spots out of a suede skirt, but it turned out to be bleach (whoops!).  I went there a couple weeks ago to drop more stuff off, but the business was gone and an eviction notice was up.  I hope they come back! Users/LizMoffitt

20081202 11:50:39 nbsp I used to use this location, but now use the Woodland location. I was always happy with their work until I took a white suit jacket to them. It had no stains when it came in, just needed to be cleaned. When I got it back the whole front of the jacket looked like it was splattered with something light orange. The woman who was helping me was upfront about the stains, but said I must have used bleach on the jacket before, and that was the only possible cause. Since the jacket was new and never washed, I knew this wasnt true. She said she wouldnt charge me for the jacket (how nice...sarcasm), and would give me my next dry cleaning for free. Since the location was so convenient, I did end up returning, but months later. She remembered me immediately and didnt charge me for the next service. That was the only problem I had with them, which was pretty irritating, but I wonder a bit now that the Davis location was served an eviction notice.  Users/AmLin

20091222 15:52:33 nbsp the one in woodland is not as good as this one in Davis...unfortunately, the davis one closed. I went to the woodland one and its not really that good. I found stains still on my shirt and jacket. The owners are ordinary...wont find anything special  Users/lakers09
