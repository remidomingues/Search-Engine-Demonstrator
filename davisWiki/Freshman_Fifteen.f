The Freshman Fifteen refers to the fifteen pounds that the average Freshmen freshman gains during his or her first year of college. When Breakfast breakfast, lunch and dinner are buffet style, some students add on a layer of fat to prepare themselves for the near future when theyll have to move out of the Dorms dorms and Microwave Cooking cook for themselves.  At schools with higher standards of cuisine, they tend to refer to the Freshman Twenty. The freshman fifteen can also be attributed not only to the buffet style dining, but also the increased Alcohol alcohol consumption by many freshmen and a lack of dietary supervision.

Davis isnt exactly the best school for gaining weight, what with all the Bicycling biking freshman are forced to undergo (or, if you prefer, Places to Walk or Run walking). If you have really bad luck, your classes could be spread out all over campus and you end up having to travel miles on a daily basis to get to class. Some remote parts of campus can take a while to reach even on a bike. There are also many ways to Exercise exercise, should you not like the larger you. Also, Health Education and Promotion and Nutrition 10 can help you learn how to eat properly.

The Freshman Fifteen used to be much more of a problem before the Dining Commons stopped the practice of using trays. Back when Freshmen had trays in the Dining Commons, they used to pile on the plates of food. There was a huge amount of overeating and a large amount of waste. You would see people with stacks of plates filled with food as well as multiple cups of drinks on one tray. These days you are limited to carrying only one dish or two. You have to get up and go back if you want to get multiple dishes.

The Freshman Fifteen also has an element of peer pressure. Often Freshmen use meal times as a social gathering. Large groups of people will encourage each other to go to the DC at the same time together. Even if you arent hungry you feel pressure to go along and socialize. In most cases, you get in line and get food as to not seem out of place and you end up eating more than you intend to.



20050104 05:39:02 nbsp I definitely gained 22 pounds in the first two months, freshman year, but have stayed the same weight ever since. I was actually pretty damn skinny before, and wanted to gain weight. The DC is bad news if you dont, though. Users/PaulIvanov

20050126 14:54:39 nbsp I gained over 15 pounds in my first two quarters here.  I lost it all, and then some, the following summer when I had to fend for myself in 720. Users/RishiTrivedi

20050126 18:28:49 nbsp I actually lost weight after moving in as a Freshman, as I frequently found myself forgetting to eat before they closed.  This was not helped by the position of my room in the dorms, where exactly no one would walk past it on their way to the Dining Commons.  If you come from a home where food is constantly available 24 hours, and you have an odd activity cycle that makes you naturally eat at strange times, it takes some work to remind yourself when to eat DC food. Users/ScottRitchie

20050126 22:32:53 nbsp I thought the food was so disgusting (I found a ladybug in my salad once) and that the Recreation Hall was so great... I ended up getting the Freshman negative eighteen... and have stayed the same weight since. I think part of it was that I never ate the main dishes and stuck with salads, and a lot of times I wouldnt have time to eat before they closed. Users/AbbyLawson

20050228 03:12:36 nbsp I lost around 15 pounds the year I came to Davis. I chalk it up to stealing tons of food from the DC and munching on it instead of going to meals. Users/HaleyKo

20050228 21:11:49 nbsp FRESHMAN 20 !!!! But I was 85 pounds, I needed it.  I can shop for big peoples clothes now! Users/JenndelaVega

20050324 17:10:25 nbsp For my first two quarters here Ive actually lost 23 pounds.  Ive gotten tired of the DC food and have resorted to eating out more often. Users/PatrickSing

20051003 15:50:26 nbsp When I hear people complaining about how some restaurants serve them TOO MUCH food or some meals have too many calories, I just have to shake my head. I have calculated the calories/dollar ratio for all the foods I buy. I use this list to maximize my food dollar. You want to maximize your energy, not minimize it! I dont understand how people can leave food on their plates at restaurants. There are a lot of things I dont understand about people. Users/SteveDavison
    Amen!!  It seemed like I was the only one always doing calorie/dollar calculations for all my food.  Users/JevanGray Jevan
    Steve, what do you usually eat? Users/JudithTruman JT
      Im on the seefood diet. I see food, I eat it. Users/SteveDavison
      Thats the short answer, the long answer is: What I actually eat and what I would like to eat are completely different, alas. If money were no object, I would be vegetarian to start with. I think organic is the way to go (but for different reasons than most people believe). I would optimize for nutrition instead of calories (though calories are still important). My philosophy is that its not how much you eat, its what you eat. The body has certain requirements that manifest in unconscious ways. In other words, if you are deficient in a nutrient, it will have you eat much more food just to get it. I shop almost exclusively at the Davis Food Coop. The less processed the food, the better processing seldom adds nutrients, its for cosmetic/manufacturing/marketing reasons. Everything that you eat which is not a nutrient is a waste product which the body must expel. BTW, Im a skinny guy, at 128lbs. Users/SteveDavison
    Right on! Walkers Shortbread is so good, 1400 Cal/box ($3? $5?)! Mmmm, so much butter (half of the calories in the cookie from  fat), and carbohydrates too. Lipids and carbohydrates are half of the real four food groups after all. There is so much propaganda now about how high calorie food is unhealthy and it is like saying it is better for you car if you put less gas in. The real problem is people not getting off their ass. Walk or ride a bike to work, the library, even the buffet restaurant, and experience the world instead of going to a gym for exercise like it is another job! Users/NickSchmalenberger
    Well, really, the less gas you have in a car the lighter it is, so it gets better gas mileage. Users/BradBenedict

20060112 20:55:02 nbsp I was once a poor little skinny girl who couldnt donate blood.  Now Im still a poor little skinny girl who cant donate blood, but now Im up to triple digits in weight!  Thank you, DC food! Users/KarinaSummers

20070417 12:15:54 nbsp God damn, the Freshman Fifteen?  I gained the Freshman Fing FIFTY.  Stupid DC.  I blame the fact that the old Segundo DC was so incredibly ugly, it made you eat your feelings.  Or something. Users/MargieHalloran

20070805 21:13:22 nbsp Im an incoming freshman and I eat alot.. I guess all the freshman have the bingeeating {{{>__<}}}... Users/xcutioners

20080115 05:59:37 nbsp i actually stayed the same weight all throughout freshman year

oh, DC, i never appreciated you when i had you... Users/fredchen

20080115 15:28:48 nbsp I found that I pretty much maintained my weight through freshman year. I attribute this to the fact that i would never go to late night (because its a rip off in terms of selection vs. price). Thus, while I ate huge meals I would stay up past 12 without eating after 8. Not eating at night really helps as far as weight loss is concerned. Pretty much if you are going to bed hungry, you will probably lose weight. Users/MattHh

20080409 13:53:36 nbsp These days, I think the Freshmen Fifty is more accurate.  Is it just me or are freshmen getting fatter each year?  I understand these are people that are just starting college and the DCs serve too much food and blah, blah blahfatcakes.  But heres the thing, even if you eat crap all day, you really shouldnt be gaining that much weight.  Perhaps you dont lose weight, but you should break even.  A lot of people are moving around more while at UC Davis because they are running around all day going to class, taking care of errands, etc.  My first year, I would have class in Social Sci 1100 and then have to jam to Chem 194 and then back across campus to make my class in Hunt.  Then I would walk to lunch and then go back to find an open computer in one of the labs.  And a lot of people had similar schedules.  Im sure thats why I dropped a ton of weight my first year (and all I ate was crap.  A lot of crap).   Users/CurlyGirl26
  I dont think the drinking helps. For a lot of students, this is the first introduction to alcohol, or at least having greater access to it, plus peer pressure to drink more than you can handle, and the excess turns to fat.  Users/ElleWeber
