Freshmen should check out the Freshman Guide for advice on existence.

As at all other schools, freshmen are first year students and are a species of undergraduate students (Subgraduatera freshmanense). Freshmen at Campus UC Davis often live in the dorms where they sometimes mate and have been known to successfully Pregnancy breed on occasion, at times giving birth on the nest floor.  Prior to spring, their primary mating season, both males and females often present with a dark Freshman Stripe stripe.


Claims that the proper plural form is Freshmans rather than Freshmen (by analogy with, e.g., Musselmans) have gone almost entirely unnoticed. The proper collective noun is a gaggle of freshmen, unless someone can come up with a better one.

The term freshman is considered sexist by some; however, it is generally accepted that the masculine tense is the neutral. Firstyear student is the politically correct nomenclature, but Freshpeople is a much more fun phrase. Only The California Aggie The Aggie uses Firstyear student.

One of many nomenclatures is a gaggle of Freshmen.BR
nbspUsage: A gaggle of Freshmen huddled on the sidewalk beside AM/PM hoping they could find 40 Ounce Meal Plan someone to buy.

Also freshmen are more likely to commit dormcest than any other species.

Freshmen may be seen on the weekends flocking towards the Gilmore and Bixby highrises for the notorious floor parties and Free Beer free booze found therein.
