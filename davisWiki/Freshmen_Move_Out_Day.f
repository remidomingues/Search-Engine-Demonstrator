 About Spring Cleaning 

UC Davis Student Housings Spring Cleaning program takes place in the residence halls during finals week.  As students prepare to move out they may donate unwanted reusable goods, eWaste, and nonperishable foods.  Collection bins are conveniently setup in all residence halls.  Items are donated to Goodwill, the Aggie Reuse Store, and the Food Bank of Yolo County.

More information about the event, including maps, can be found at http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/sustainability/springcleaning.asp. Those interested in volunteer opportunities should contact the UC Davis Student Housing Sustainability Coordinator at sustainablehousing@ucdavis.edu.
