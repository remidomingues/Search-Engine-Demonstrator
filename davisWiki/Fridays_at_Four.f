Artists and performers from Campus campus, the Davis community, and beyond showcase their original work in a huge, welcoming, and free open forum for artistic expression.

Like the name says, Fridays @ 4 happens every Friday at (you guessed it) 4:00 PM at Cafe Roma, on the corner of 3rd and University, next to Navins.

This is a rare opportunity for an eager audience to come see fresh new artists and performers be seen.
