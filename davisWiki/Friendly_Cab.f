Robbery Sept 16, 2011
A Friendly Cab driver was reportedly assaulted and robbed in the early morning hours of Sept 16th, crashing into two parked cars on a residential street and through a fence as a result.  The owner states that at about 3:30 am he was telephoned by the police, informed of multiple collisions and that the driver had fled the scene.  He was instructed to go meet Davis Police officers.  After the police left the drivers home the driver arrived at his home.  He was transported by ambulance to UCDMC for a concussion.  Before being transported he blew 0.0 on a breathalyzer.  According to the driver he had been flagged down by two thinnish young white men and one thicker young black man.  At the end of the fare, without warning he was hit in the back of the head and became semi conscious.  Apparently he was robbed by the passengers and they left the vehicle.  He started driving in an attempt to escape which caused the collisions.  Then he walked nearly two miles home while the police were looking for him.

20110130 17:28:00 nbsp It was nice to meet you Art.  I am continually surprised at how the Wiki so often transfers to the real world.  I agree with everything that was stated and still feel the local cabs should work together to resolve the problem with the unlicensed and extremely shady 24/7 service. Users/WesP

20110205 00:31:26 nbsp I like how it ask How was your ride?

Ive used taxicab twice, the first time was great, but not the the second. In fact, I didnt even have the pleasure of a second ride. When I called for a ride, the office had told me it would take the driver 20 minutes for pickup, but my wait turned into 45minutes. In about 25 minutes into the wait, I called the office to see where my driver was, but they didnt pick up. I must have called four times, finally leaving a message saying yo, where you at??...I still didnt get a reply. So i gave it about another 20 minutes, finally leaving another message, saying please tell the driver to be called off. Right when I take my shoes off and relax, someone calls asking if I wanted a ride still...I asked him where are you, and how long will you be, he replied well, I need your address in order to give you an estimation..._ I told him my address, and he said itll be 10 minutes...I told him no thank you. If they guy had called, and said Im going to be a little LATE, I would have been fine with that. Dont
leave a person hanging Art. :( Users/dmawright


20110208 11:08:39 nbsp Walked out of my apartment last fall on a weekend night to the sound of sirens and the smell of burning motor oil. I was greeted by an acquaintance claiming the cab he had called was on fire down the street. After a few exploded tires, emergency services were able to douse the flames. The next morning, I found this:

Friendly Cab. No surprises there. Users/ElJefe

So my roommates dad is driving for Friendly right now. He is also crashing on my couch for a few days until he gets back on his feet. On Friday morning (32511) 4am, this crazy broad got picked up from the Grad. Anyway, she was so drunk that she seemed almost schitzo. First thing she said to the driver was, Im so fucked up that my friends ditched me. She stole the cab phone at the destination she was dropped off at and the driver had to chase her to get it back. When she was told to pay the fare, she went crazy and asked for her friends to be, let out of the trunk??? So he assured her that there was no one in the trunk, and then she exclaimed that she wanted some cock...the driver was horrified and finally got her to sign a credit card slip..with no tip..as he drove away she banged on the cab demanding to see some cock....weird shit!!! â€”users/JoshLawson



20110326 09:20:56 nbsp Called these guys to pick up one of my clients yesterday.  Quite rude.  He asked, From where to where?  I replied, From APEX Cycles, 338 G Street to blah, blah, blah. Wheres that? Corner of 4th and G, Next to Little Prague Restaurant... thats when he cut me off and yelled, Just tell me where it is!  Umm... Im trying to. Is it a business? Yeah, APEX Cycles.  Fine, Ill find it.  Ill be there in 1015 minutes.  Seriously in need of some customer service training. Users/Aaron.Curtin
  Sorry that you had a problem.  I appreciate that you gave specifics in your complaint.  I talked to the driverdispatcher and he said that he wanted to come to your shop and apologize.  He explained that you did not say the name or the address or that it was a bicycle shop, and that he was trying to discover one of those specifics from you.  This was while he was busy with other calls and was trying to drive also.  It would have helped if we had had a dispatch base that was free of driving duty.  We will try to make corrections so that this type of situation does not reoccur.  Again, I apologize that you had an unpleasant telephone experience.  Thanks for calling and then subsequently stating your specific experience. Users/BruceHansen Art

20110504 22:12:13 nbsp These guys drive like jackasses. I nearly got hit the other day by one. They had a van full of people. I am in a full size truck and they ran a stop sign to get ahead of me when I was pulling out of Jack N The Box. I was shocked. Users/Dozer
 Nothing like this should EVER happen.  Please give details infoAT7501111.com.  Thank you very much. Users/BruceHansen Art

 I like your enthusiasm brother. Its great, but in all honesty I dont know what else to tell. I pulled out of Jack in the Box and a Friendly Cab van driving like a jackass raced to cut me off. I was pretty shocked because there was nobody behind me (no reason to rush) and I drive a full size truck. I saw silhouettes of people in the windows. Thats about all the detail I have.  Users/Dozer
 I like brother much better.  I remember an incident which occured about two weeks ago.  I may have seen a vehicle stopped at the exit when I stopped at the stop sign.  Proceeding southward through the intersection I noticed it creeping into the street.  (It was behind a bubble curb which protrudes more than six feet beyond the regular curb.)  I was surprised that the vehicle didnt stop; it kept creeping out into the street;  I dodged it.  I was sorry that the incident occured and remarked to my passengers that I didnt know that the vehicle would drive out in the street like that.  (Otherwise, I would have stopped beforehand and let it do what it was going to do.) Users/BruceHansen Art

20110508 14:43:42 nbsp I was very upset with the service last night.

I called Friendly Cab, and I have before with no problem, but I got a lot of attitude from the operator. He was very accusatory when I called him after he was 20 minutes late. He said he knocked on my door many times and nobody came out, and that when he called my number it went straight to voicemail. To which I said, How can you even knock on my door when I didnt tell you which apartment number? The guy also said that he couldnt call back my number, which didnt make sense because he had just called me back. But anyways, he was very rude and demeaning in his tone about how he sent a driver who kept knocking on my door. He told me he called my 916  XXX  XXXX number and I told him thats not me, my area code is 408  you have the wrong person. And then my phone died and I had to use my boyfriends phone and they asked us not to play games, that we were messing with them by throwing out a 3rd phone number.

Anyways, we eventually got picked up by a grumbly man who never apologized (ironic for Friendly Cab). Apparently they had gotten a lot of prank phone calls  but that is no excuse to treat innocent customers in a very accusatory way. Im never calling again.  Users/KellyMatheson

 I havent spoken to the person/persons involved yet, but I just wanted to apologe.  There should have been less confusion and you should have gotten more respect and friendliness. Users/BruceHansen Art
 I spoke to the drivers.  The driver who picked you up initially called a 530 phone number and it seemed to be a wrong number;  he decided not to knock on your door.  He was then given two more numbers to call, but then was told that you would be waiting on the corner and you and your boyfriend were.  He didnt think that you seemed upset.  He told me that he didnt know what he was supposed to apologize for  he picked you up. (He wasnt the person on the phone that you thought he was.) He didnt think he was grumbly.
 Thats about all the information I have about your complaint.  Its interesting about last night that it seems there were about twelve calls at a fraternity house last night, Saturday, where the callers wouldnt respond to phone calls to get in the cab.  Today we picked up a young man from the Sutter Davis ER who, it turns out, is a member of that fraternity and was a casualty of last night.  He apologized for any rudeness that occured and was very appreciate of the cab ride. Users/BruceHansen Art
      Do people like you ever wonder why weekend night cab drivers are disgruntled and dont treat you like a princess? We have to deal with shit like this ALL night!! Even your sanitized description of your behavior would be maddening to any sane person, let alone someone who has been treated like human toilet paper all night. Shame on you, for being a lazy dumbass and not getting your facts straight. If you have problems with a cab company, just call someone else..this is America, you have choices...Next time you bitch about how entitled you think you should be, have your story make sense at least.... Users/JoshLawson


 About Bruces response  I appreciate the apology. I understand bizarre circumstances happen, especially in a college town. Sorry about the grumbly comment.
   About Joshs response  I dont know if you two are buddies or what, I dont appreciate this one as much. You werent there, and it was enough of a disassociated experience to be confused about: me on 2 different phones, one person picking up the phone, and the other driving. I dont think my account gave the impression that I wanted to be treated as a princess. Im allowed to expect them to get my number right and to expect to be picked up on time. I called Friendly Cab for a service, one they are paid for, not demanded of. And for what am I being lazy?... What facts are you referring too? I myself am critical, and 100% realize this is only my side of the story. This is not a historical account, its a DavisWiki comment  it should be generally understood to read these posts with skepticism ... Yes, this is America. I couldve called a different cab, but they already invested time in me. And being a patient person, I decided to follow through with them and to also prove that I wasnt playing any games. This is America, where people can post personal, biased opinions on the internet all they want. So please feel free to post back, but this is the only time I plan on responding.  Kelly

Just remember people, Friendly Cab ALWAYS takes credit cards!! There is a day driver that MANY folks complain about NOT taking cards, but he is supposed to and just doesnt want to take them. I personally feel that they should do a $10 minimum, but that is just me... Users/JoshLawson

20110724 09:14:09 nbsp Ive been a hotel employee for some years now and, as such, Ive had quite a lot of experience with working the cutthroat business of getting a lastminute cab on a sunday morning. Gotta say, Friendly is usually the easiest company to get a ride from. Ive never heard complaint from a guest on their service and met Bruce, myself, some months ago. Found him to be a very knowledgeable businessman.

That said, please keep in mind that most folks who leave negative comments on this wiki are onetime users who generally dont know what theyre talking about and just want somewhere to complain instead of contacting the business themselves to solve problems like adults. :) Users/KBathory
 
20110916 16:14:19 nbsp The Friendly Cab driver, Tom Moss, at about 3 am dropped off a fare that had telephoned for a cab.  Soon after that three men, two white and one black, flagged him down.  When he dropped them off, without warning, he received a blow to the back of the head which gave him a concussion.  He apparently then drove the cab and hit a couple of parked cars.  A resident where the cars were, talked to him as he sat in her yard. She said he said he was running, but he wasnt.  When the police arrived at the scene near 8th and M Street where all the vehicles were, Tom wasnt there.  The police visited numerous residences nearby as well as Toms residence and maybe another place looking for him , but they couldnt find him.  Later Tom arrived at his residence, not being conscious of what happened after he got hit on the head.  The EMT who then arrived at his residence informed the police that Tom had suffered a concussion.  The police administered a breathalizer test which showed no alcohol.  An ambulance transported Tom to the USD Medical Center in Sacramento.  After treatment he was released later this morning.  Tom has never been cited for a traffic violation his whole life.  Apparently due to the action of those three men Tom and Friendly Cab are taking responsibility for significant damage to two parked vehicles.  The Friendly Cab is also out of commission. Users/BruceHansen Art

20110916 17:32:56 nbsp How coincidental.  Tom Moss, the Friendly Cab driver, who was reportedly robbed and beaten and whose cab was wrecked on M Street, just sat down next to me and made a phone call describing the incident to someone.  I had just finished reading the post.  He sounded factual and consistent with the Davis police blotter report.  Too bad.  No one deserves such treatment.   Users/fknochenhauer

20110916 19:23:52 nbsp This incident will be on the 10 and 11 pm news on KCRA Channel 3. Users/BruceHansen Art

20110918 10:10:21 nbsp The Friendly Cab driver in the incident of early Friday September 16, Tom Moss, appeared on the nightly news on KCRA TV.  From that exposure and from the Davis Wiki and Davis Enterprise (Are there any others?) people in Davis have shouted their support to him on the street as well as telling him in the cab.  Friendly Cab appreciates the ocean of support. Users/BruceHansen Art

20110921 13:34:13 nbsp Are there any suspects in this case or what? Mupdup claimed that a person named  James Earl Williams, Jr. was arrested inwhen  connection to the incident. Was mupdup just talking out of his/her ass or what? Users/ScottMeehleib
 It seems that MupDup was relaying information which originated with the police.  Actually this person was not involved. Users/BruceHansen Art

20121122 19:59:46 nbsp The service was great today!!!! The pickup was on time, the driver helped me load my bike on the cab and he was nice enough to give me a ride back when we realized that my destination was closed. In addition, I forgot my credit card with him and he drove all the way back to give it to me. Will try this cab service again for sure!!! Users/Dharmaveer
