Friends Urging Campus Kindness (backronyzed from F.U.C.K.) was an ASUCD political slate in the energetic Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.  They ran  seven Winter 2005 ASUCD Election/Senate Candidates Senate Candidates for the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate.  Candidates Rob Roy and users/KristenBirdsall Kristen Birdsall were elected. The slate evolved from the SOSSS slate that ran in the Fall 2004 elections, and the  driving philosophy behind the candidate selection was Hey, you  you should run for Senate!  Anyones better than who weve got now!

In winter of 2006, likely due to disagreement regarding the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Unqualified Candidates Scandal unqualified candidates issue of the fall 2005 election, slate members Rob Roy and Kristen Birdsall renounced their affiliation with the Friends slate and declared themselves independents.  As the only two elected members of the slate, this action means there are no longer any official Friends Urging Campus Kindness members in office.

It was a Slate slate with Friends Urging Campus Kindness Issues real issues and a  Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform platform.  The slate updated its Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform platform page as the year progressed so students could see how the slate was keeping its campaign promises.

 General Information 
The Slate slate began the early stages of its campaign during the very first day of Winter quarter, 2005. and began speaking to groups, tabling, and producing campaign flyers and spraypainted tshirts during the second week.  They had become a prominent third party in UC Davis Politics.

The slate won 2 of the 8 available ASUCD Senate Senate seats in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election, and candidate Rob Roy was elected in the first round.  This showed a clear mandate for the slate and its policies.  Candidate Users/KristenBirdsall Kristen Birdsall, is another Friend who was elected and both are wiki regulars.

During the campaign the Slate slate had office Hours on the Quad, an idea which many past senate candidates have promised.  Their senators currently hold office hours on the Quad during lunch at least once a week.

During the campaign, you could look for the Friends Urging Campus Kindness towel taped to a table. A major goal of this tabling activity is to talk to students and find out what issues are important to them, and use this information to for a Platform of the People. Friends Urging Campus Kindness also uses this time to make campaign shirts for anyone who brings them a shirt to spray paint with one of their selection of stencils and many color options.

Rob Roy also kept a detailed Livejournal livejournals about his doing as a Senator.  http://www.livejournal.com/~senatorroy Rob Roys Senate LJ.  Kristen Birdsall began one but didnt keep up with it for long.

 Acronym 

The Slate slates name was chosen because it forms the acryonym F.U.C.K. and Users/RevChad wanted to know if The California Aggie would acryonize it like they do with LEAD L.E.A.D.  The answer to this is no, as explained in http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/01/24/Features/WhenAcronyms.Go.Awry1319280.shtml?norewrite200607290401&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com Ryan Fullers column in The California Aggie.

 Past Campaigns 
 Winter 2005 Official Candidates 
These people ran in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.
  Rob Roy
  Teresa Kenny
  Pete Hernandez Pedro Pete Hernandez
  Users/Kristen Birdsall Kristen Birdsall
  Mohammad Yahya Rouhani
  Chad Van Schoelandt who ran in the last election with SOSSS
  Paul Ivanov


They supported a couple independent candidates, specifically:
  Users/Avi Singh Avanindar Avi Singh
  Jonathon Leathers
  Friends Urging Campus Kindness also supports the troops but does not support military recruiters

For the Presidential race, they have decided to support the L.E.A.D. candidates who have been very helpful to the Friends in making election reform. These particular Leadites are considered good people, so vote for them.

They also have a list of campaign managers which includes:
  Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs who was a campaign manager for SOSSS last election
  Chris Rood who ran in the last election with SOSSS
  Anthony Parisi who was a SOSSS groupie in the last election
  Users/MarieHuynh Marie Huynh who ran in the last election with SOSSS

They have two campaign advisors giving advice on the crucial issues in the swing frats.
  Paul Amnuaypayoat who is a Davis College Libertarians Libertarian and Agnostic and Atheist Student Association Atheist, so doesnt really believe in anything.
  Users/BarnabasTruman Barnabas Truman who represents the opinions of the Ancient Order of Walkers.

Note that there is no head campaign manager, resulting in much chaos and furthering the myth that this Slate slate is composed of a bunch of wiki:WikiPedia:Discordian discordians. They have no official relation to the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, not that such an organization exists or anything.

Most importantly, their official mascot is Yev, also nicknamed wiki:WikiPedia:Checkers_speech Checkers.


 Rob Roy for Senate 
Very early in the campaign a Rob Roy for Senate wiki page was made. And a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200303701 Rob Roy for Senate facebook.com group (which has now been transformed into a Rob Roy for Mayor group).

Here are some of the pro Rob Roy banners:






 The Slate Reborn? 
On a pleasant Monday afternoon, near the start of the Fall 2006 finals week, there was a gathering in the halls of the ASUCD floor of the Memorial Union, the subject at hand was the need of another organization to push for reform in the senate, rather than reuse the same organization which admittedly belonged to former students, a new organization is being developed, please see Friends Urging Campus Kindness, Education and Diversity, have a nice day.

 The Slate ReReborn? 
Not really, but ASUCD Senator Maxwell Kappes has now selfaffiliated himself with the slate until he gets bored or receives a Cease and Desist letter.

20050215 23:55:11 nbsp how would one steal such a thing? Users/MarieHuynh

20050218 14:18:35 nbsp Heh I like that Ari Kalfayans endorsement like statement got in here.    I think I had something else to say but I forget.  Did Ian Watson make an endorementlike statement in his article about how he agreed with you guys on something (and coined the term Urgers) ... and what about Get the Urge! as a slogan? Users/KrisFricke

An anonymous individual alledges that some of the tape used by Friends.. caused paint to peel off their door.  The said allegation is suspeciously close to some other allegations that Student Focus candidates had http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucdavis/1897251.html ripped down Friends.. flyers.

Im glad thats done with, but I still think the Ghandi comparisons need to stop. Its sacreligious, and nothing short.

20050221 20:16:40 nbsp The Ghandi comparison seems to be true, and it doesnt seem to be sacrilegious as we do not hold Ghandi to be sacred. Users/RevChad

You may not, but out of respect to others, you should not be saying things like that.

20050222 07:41:02 nbsp Jesus Christ, Chad.  I walk away for a couple days and you start insulting religions.  I just spent a weekend at Pantheacon, and they had now problem being tolerant of other religions  I heard less Christian bashing there than I normally hear at campus.  Ill straighten these guys out when I get back. Users/BrentLaabs

20050911 10:19:52 nbsp I think Ghandi would be pleased. He was all about kindness, and friends, and spreading kindness and compassion. I believe he would have seen Robs endorsement as a sign of respect and affection. He was an extremely intelligent man, of course. Users/SteveDavison

20050118 19:00:03 nbsp Impartial would mean being on the ASUCD Court and not sending out mass messages to ASUCD Slate facebook groups. No one talked about getting fired. I was an impartial third party member and now i am an impartial independent and I chose to confirm the members of two different political parties to senate because I thought it was the right thing to do. People should stop acting paranoid or childish because it is becoming contagious and has rubbed off on me. The session will be open. The elections committee had a closed session a few weeks ago and no one was fired. Kris Fricke has gone through a closed session and was not fired. Why would anyone think they would be getting fired. Does someone think they have done something that is worthy of it. I would hope not, all the senate intended to do when calling the closed session was investigate. So lets hold our horses and wait for tomorrow before we come to conclusions. If you want to know what the senate will do before that then visit the Davis Psychic, maybe they are still open  but you can certainly do it before 5:30 tomorrow.

20060129 23:40:27 nbsp Why is the Friends Urging Campus Kindness facebook group, founded by Rob Roy, now just advertising his City Council Election? Cant we make him dissolve the group or something, so a nonFriend isnt using it? Users/MaxMikalonis
