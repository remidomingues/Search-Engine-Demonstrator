This is the official platform of the Friends Urging Campus Kindness ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate Slate slate.  This text is not for the faint of heart, but it is the source for those who want to examine the platform in depth.  Those who want to have a more cursory look at what the Slate stands for should look at Friends Urging Campus Kindness Issues.

In the words of founding Senator Rob Roy, Friends Urging Campus Kindness was an ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate Slate slate with lots of lofty goals that were mostly created by Brent Laabs on this wiki page. Whether these goals were achieved or not, and the public scrutiny of their failure, fell upon the burden of Rob Roy and Kristen Birdsall.

The slate is dead; so is the platform.

Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs comments on Robs statement, However Rob Roy wants to phrase it, he and Kristen Birdsall did campaign on accomplishing these goals.  I dont think any of us in the slate thought we could accomplish all of them, even at the outset of the campaign.  But if we did have a common basis that brought us together as a slate, it would be the platform.  Indeed I did write the platform, but only after consulting and combining the ideas of the original 17member slate.  And when Rob ran, he promised he would support everything from the The Countback Amendment to No Embezzlement.  Rob and Kristen have now abandoned these promises, rather than holding themselves accountable for their promises.

If they had chosen to remain true to the ideas they campaigned on, they would have been judged very highly  accomplishing a large number of the original groups goals.  Instead, Rob Roy has chosen to blame me with his failure.



Reading this document
Updates on the progress of particular issues will be color coded as follows:

 Student Government for All Students 
  Downstairs Office Hours:: Very few students know what the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate actually does; even fewer know how to contact their senators.  We at Friends Urging Campus Kindness plan to hold office hours on the Quad, or at ASUCDs office on the first floor of the Memorial Union MU during inclement weather.  In this way, we will better be able to connect to students.  All you have to do is walk by the Memorial Union MU at lunch time, and a senator will be available to talk about the issues you care about.


  ASUCD Documents Available Online:: Currently, very few government documents are online.  Only bills already passed by the ASUCD Senate Senate and signed by the ASUCD President President are online &#8211; but wouldnt you like to know about that $42,000 laser printer before they buy it?  Many documents are only available on the third floor of the Memorial Union MU, and you have to ask to look at them, as they are not on public display.  Making ASUCD budgets, upcoming ASUCD Senate Senate bills, ASUCD Senate Senate agendas, and ASUCD Court ASUCD Court documents available online is a good remedy to an administration which has repeatedly broken the public trust.


See ASUCD Open Government for more information.  Also, Jonathon Leathers bill is a step in the right direction, but it still doesnt put anything aside from ASUCD Senate bills (pending, revised, etc) online.  So still no budgets or ASUCD Court documents.

  ASUCD Documents Available at Senate Meetings:: Whenever we attend the ASUCD Senate senate, there are never enough agendas available for everyone.  Those with their own laptops may be able to access them if they are available online, as mentioned above.  However, we would like a laptop and a printer available at ASUCD Senate senate meetings, so that no student is left out of the proceedings.  In this way, everyone can understand the process, comment, and help build better bylaws &#8211; without needing to waste paper!


  Promote Interactions with Student Clubs:: Student clubs are one of the most important aspects, and have a variety of needs.  Since these organizations are the best place for students to have a collective voice in student government, we have already passed a provision in the Electoral Reform bill to allow Student Organizations to endorse candidates.  We will cooperate with Senator Janine Fiel and seek to hear the opinions of many different campus clubs.


  Senate Meetings in the Coffee House:: We feel that the ASUCD government spends way too much time on the third floor of the Memorial Union MU.  By moving the ASUCD Senate senate meetings into the Coffee House, we can promote ASUCD, increase attendance, and accommodate more people.  This may require meetings to start at 6 PM instead of 5:30 PM, but this change is a small sacrifice compared to the input of the people.



 Commissions and Committees 
  Merge Health and Wellbeing Committee into Gender and Sexuality Commission:: The Health and Wellbeing Committee has only one or two projects every year, and yet the members are paid and the unit has a budget.  We think that we need to stop this piece of government pork and reorganize the committees duties into the duties of the Gender and Sexuality Commission. As health is a major issue in sexuality, we feel that this Gender and Sexuality Commission GASC is the best equipped to deal with the mission of promoting health in general.  In addition, it would lend credibility to the unit, which comes under frequent fire from those with less kinky leanings. Also, after the merger, we will support renaming the Gender and Sexuality Commission into something more inclusive if there is enough impetus to do so.


  Increase Gender and Sexuality Commissions Budget:: Cost of one fire truck for Aggie Pack to launch tube socks: $5,000.  Annual budget of the Gender and Sexuality Commission: $3,099.  We believe that the ASUCD Senate Senate has misplaced its priorities in the past by promoting special interests such as Aggie Pack rather than funding projects that benefit a large number of students. Gender and Sexuality Commission GASC projects are educational as well as entertaining, and provide a lot more quality to student life than getting hit in the head by a tube sock.


  Senators at Commission Meetings:: One of the problems that is almost routine in ASUCD Senate Senate is the lack of Senators at Commission meetings.  These commissions are the heart and soul of ASUCD ASUCDs activities at UC Davis. We promise that our Slate slate members will attend more commission meetings, so that we will be able to make informed decisions on important issues.  We also promise to read all of the legislation before we come to ASUCD Senate senate meetings. That should be a nobrainer, but it is far too often an issue at ASUCD Senate senate meetings.


 ASUCD Budget 
  Fiscal Responsibility:: We promise to stop wasteful spending, because your tuition keeps increasing due to the State of Californias financial difficulties.  Yet a part of your tuition goes to pay for ASUCD programs, to the tune of $105.  Though we hope to be able to return part of this money to you, the least we can do is to be fiscally responsible in how we spend your hardearned (or hardDirect Loaned) money.



  Stopping Wasteful Spending:: During the last year at ASUCD Senate Senate, some very odd projects got approved.  The foremost of these lapses in senatorial judgment was the purchase of a fire truck for Aggie Pack.  We would not oppose the truck if it was intended to put out fires, but this truck is intended to rain down tube socks on the heads of Aggie fans.  Tube socks, for Gods sake! Even worse, the truck isnt even working yet! Recently, the ASUCD Senate Senate passed a bill to allocate $80 to purchase a big sign saying ASUCD Senator Office Hours for having office hours on the quad. The problem: they already had such a sign, which was in perfectly usable condition but hasnt been used in years. The bill was passed unanimously with the old sign in the room, so Users/RevChad and Rob Roy permanently borrowed without permission the old sign with plans to protest this wasteful spending by using only the old sign should they win senate seats. ASUCD should focus projects that benefit students, not special interests and absurd redundancy.


There has certainly been progress in other areas than the vinyl sign.  I agree the sign purchase is stupid, though  especially since its the freaking external affairs commission (and not the external affairs office..a minor point but its important because ones duty is to see legislation and the other is supposed to actually be out there, you know, doing stuff Users/PhilipNeustrom

  Cheaper ASUCD Retreats:: Currently, there is an ASUCD government retreat which takes place in Lake Tahoe and costs you, the student, $2,000 of ASUCD funds.  Im sure everyone involved in ASUCD enjoys the cabins and the catering, and Im sure it helps everyone to become friends &#8211; just like our Slate slate!  But the problem is that it doesnt benefit anyone but the student government officials themselves.  We believe that we can become friends without spending so much money.  We urge the ASUCD Senate Senate to show kindness to the campus by holding a retreat somewhere far cheaper, maybe as a camping trip or on campus.  Some members of the Slate slate suggested holding it at the Pirate Ship, but for some reason #1 candidate Rob Roy didnt like us volunteering his house.  Weve been told that there is an extra mattress there for those who pass out from overlegislation.


  Twothirds Amendment for Increasing Fees:: Currently, ASUCD has the highest fees of any student body in the U.C. system.  Due to two initiatives that have passed in recent years &#8211; the Move to D1 and the FACE Initiative &#8211; your fees have shot up dramatically.  Since voter turnout is so small in ASUCD elections, a minority of people can easily overwhelm a majority of students who dont want the initiative but are not informed enough to vote.  We believe that a fee increase should represent everyones desire for a bigger student government, and so we propose an ASUCD Constitutional Amendment that will require twothirds of voters to increase the amount you pay in fees.


  No Embezzlement:: For those of you who still think fondly of the SOSSS Students for an Orwellian Student Senate Slate (SOSSS), we still carry some of their traditions forward to this day.  One of those traditions is a promise that every member of the Friends Urging Campus Kindness Slate slate will uphold: We doublepluspromise that we will embezzle unmore than other candidates.  If youre wondering if this is really an issue, I have two words for you: Black Caesar Tiqula Bledsoe.  You can look him up.


  Support Community Projects:: We have a strong sense of activism, and we feel that ASUCD funds should be directed towards resources for the campus community in Davis or the world at large. For instance, The House, DavisWiki, and the Counseling Center all provide a great deal of Campus Kindness.  But we should not isolate ourselves from the world community either; ASUCD money should be spent to help tsunami relief and future natural disasters of that scale.


  Audits of ASUCD Units:: ASUCD has many units, and many of them are quite good at serving the undergraduates here at UCD: The Coffee House, Unitrans, and the Whole Earth Festival, and The California Aggie.  However, some programs really need a lot of research to see whether they truly serve the campus community.  AGTV is a good opportunity to work on television, but do their ratings justify the program?  Campus safety is an issue important to many of us, but is the Campus Safety Unit working in an effective way to increase safety?  We are not afraid to investigate fully before we come to any decision, as it is the job of the ASUCD Senate Senate to make sure that your money is serving you.



 External Affairs 
  The Fight for Your Right to Party:: John Locke once said that the right to party is alienable, and has to be fought for (Stewart et al. 2004).  This fact is very apparent in Davis, a community divided into students and residents.  The residents, who control most of the city government in Davis, refuse to acknowledge many of the aspects that shape college life.  But candidate Rob Roy, as well as the rest of the Slate slate, will fight for your right to party.  In fact, Rob Roy has a vested interest in it, as concerts at his house, the Pirate Ship, rack up hundreds of dollars in noise violations.  The Davis Police Department Davis Police enforce a strict policy against open containers of  Alcohol alcohol, even when having an open bottle of beer is harming no one.  If elected, we will lobby to resolve these issues by working with the Davis City Council and create an environment in Davis that includes students.


  End Davis Apartheid:: Davis is a house divided against itself.  Many students feel as if the residents wish to exclude them, and to make life difficult.  As students and residents have different priorities, it is important that both groups are represented on Davis City Council.  However, the City Council elections are held in June, during finals week when many students arent interested voting.  These elections need to be moved to November, when most other elections are held and students are most interested in voting.  We will also lobby for the city to adopt Choice Voting for council elections.


  Creating a Davis Night Life:: If only there was a good place for people to perform and have a good time in Davis, there wouldnt be the need for so many house parties.  If Davis had a nightclub, residents wouldnt be disturbed and Davis would have an actual night life.  We propose that we investigate the creation of a nightclub in the city of Davis, owned and operated by ASUCD.  We will also sell Alcohol beer and Alcohol wine produced on campus by the Food Science, Viticulture, and Enology departments.  This is our most ambitious proposal, and we will seek private investment and a business plan to create a profitable venture.


  Lobbying for Students and Ethics of Lobbying:: We promise that we will only lobby for issues that relate directly to students and student life.  This includes promoting school diversity, reducing student fees, and support for union labor on campus.  However, we will work hard to make sure that we do not endorse candidates for public office or issues that most students will not support.  This is not to say that we wont take a stand for issues we believe in.  We plan on using the ASUCD Senate senate as a soapbox on which to present our issues, without making the ASUCD Senate senate vote.  In this way, we can balance activism with responsibility to all of the students we represent.


  No Dead Day on Saturday:: The UC Davis University schedule should offer a real day off between classes and their finals, not a lame excuse for a Dead Day on Saturday.  They should know that we already have that day off, but we really could use an extra day to study.  If the University wants us to do well on our finals, we believe that they should give us an actual Dead Day for studying.  This Slate slate is committed to lobbying the UC Davis University to give us a real Dead Day.



 ASUCD Internal Reforms 
  More Power to the Judicial Branch:: The Judicial Branch has very little power in ASUCD, and that has clearly caused an imbalance of power in the student government.  The other two branches have been free to create many controversies due to the lack of oversight: the Election Statement Controversy, the Campaigning in Dorms Controversy, and Lamargate.  We seek to restore the power of the ASUCD Court so that procedural errors can be avoided in the ASUCD Senate senate, commissions, committees, and the ASUCD President presidency.  This might require a public prosecutor and a public defender to work for ASUCD to bring more cases before problems arise.  It also might require ASUCD be given back the elections jurisdiction.  We promise that we will make the ASUCD Court Judiciary a working branch of the student government.


  Reduced Power for the Executive:: Over his term, ASUCD President Kalen Gallagher has had free rein over all of ASUCD.  He vetoed legislation which would have kept your fees from increasing in the future.  The ASUCD Court Judicial Branch cannot author legislation because of Kalen Gallagher Kalens veto, but the ASUCD President Executive can write as much legislation as he wants.  The office of the ASUCD President president has a $20,000 slush fund, to do with as he wants.  Many of the autocrats in ASUCD have been removed, such as Queen Vicki Swett Victoria Swett and Black Caesar Tiqula Bledsoe.  Clearly, there needs to be more oversight of the ASUCD President President in the future.  The Countback Amendment, discussed below, is one important way to accomplish this.


  The Countback Amendment:: Choice Voting Choice voting is a brilliant system, because it allows you to determine a lot about voter preferences.  When a senator resigns, the next person who would have been elected fills the empty seat, if the Countback Amendment to the ASUCD Constitution is adopted.  As Kalen Gallagher has filled 4 of the 12 ASUCD Senate Senate seats due to resignations, power has shifted to the ASUCD President President and away from the people.  This amendment by the Davis College Green Party would change this; it has our full support.  In addition, we will continue our pursuit of elections reform, if need arises.


  Rewrite the senates Standing Rules:: The way the ASUCD Senate Senate currently works, abstentions are treated the same as no votes; bills must be approved by a majority of ASUCD Senate senate seats.  Thus, if there is a vacancy in the ASUCD Senate senate, it essentially counts as a no vote.  Some bills have failed even with a majority of seated senators in support the bills.  This is extraordinarily stupid.  No elected body works like this.  Majority calculations should be calculated based on the number actually participating in the vote, and it will be if were elected.


  Expand the Senate to 18 Seats:: To take full advantage of Choice Voting, we need to have more senators to represent every group on campus better.  Campus conservatives have a senator &#8211; why cant engineers?  By putting 9 people in ASUCD Senate senate seats each election (18 total), we ensure that a more diverse group is put in the ASUCD Senate senate.  Diversity of opinions is what makes a university great, and will make the ASUCD Senate senate much better informed about all of campus life.


    Just for comparison, UC Berkeley students elect 20 Senators at once.  Theyve got 36,000 students with average voter turnout around 8,0009,000.  With a threshold of 5%, this comes out to around 400 votes needed to win.  In a recent election, about 100 candidates ran from 15 registered parties.  Also, note that since ASUCD has staggered elections, the threshold for representation gets inflated twice as much.  By the way, an effort is underway this week (signaturegathering phase) at UCLA to move them to a 20member student Senate elected by choice voting.  (Dont mean to intrude on your platform  you can move this if you want.  CJ)

 Protect Freedom of Speech:: We believe the Freedom of Speech is the foundation of a free society, and that this right to expression must include Freedom of Emotional Speech as well.  However, some emotionally charged words have been censored at UC Davis UCD and in the ASUCD Senate senate, most notably by Paloma Perez. That is not like Friends Urging Campus Kindness at all.  We believe that Freedom of all speech must be protected at ASUCD Senate senate meetings, election forums, campaigns, and Write Club events.  Far too many have been censored so far, to the detriment of us all.



 Stop Moving/Threatening to Move the Project Compost office, for Christs Sake:: Not much more needs to be said, except that the Project Compost office clearly belongs where it is, underground.



 Campus Infrastructure 
  Remote print stations:: We think you should be able to print to Campus campus from anywhere, whether its from the Campus campus wireless network or from home.  We will make the printer drivers available online so anyone on the wireless network can print without taking up space in already crowded computer labs. One day, printing on campus will become as easy as {{{lpr PMUremote foo.pdf}}} is!

  Sanitary Seat Covers in Restrooms:: For some reason, there are no seat covers in Shields Library Shields Library, one of the Campus campuss dirtiest Cleanest Bathrooms bathrooms and most highly trafficked buildings.  They say that they dont have the budget for seat covers, but there are seat covers in Mrak Hall.  We will lobby the UC Davis university administration to put seat covers everywhere, as it is such a simple sanitary device that all people should have access to them when they need them. If the administration is unwilling or unable to accommodate the sanitary needs of the students, staff, and faculty that frequent Shields Library Shields Library, we will take it upon ourselves to create a bill to purchase the seat covers and pay for the installation.


     http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/10/12/FrontPage/Campus.Cuts1318323.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com This is why there are no seat covers. Perhaps Tandem Properties would pay for seat covers if they all said TANDEM  WEVE GOT YOUR ASS COVERD on them.  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen

  Speed Up Geckomail:: Some of us have noticed that the campus webmail, or Geckomail, has been exceptionally slow lately.  Were not sure where the data bottleneck is, but it would be possible to use ASUCD funds to purchase a new server if it is needed.  Though truly, it is the UC Davis universitys responsibility to maintain the system, and perhaps a little encouragement from student government is all they need to get into action.

This will never happen. Geckomail is slow because its a piece of shit program. If you want it to be faster, it needs to be rewritten. Also, I would think that email servers (ie bronze.ucdavis.edu), would be different machines than the ones that host the web program. In order to make the email servers noticibly faster, ASUCD would have to spend redicilous amounts of money. Thats not their job, they dont have a budget for buying servers. IET is much bigger than you and the ammount of beaurocracy there is incredible. If you want your email to be faster and more reliable, forward it somewhere else. Im sure IET has longrange plans to improve/replace geckomail, theyre very smart. Spending money on servers would be reactionary and stupid.  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen


  Television in the MU?:: Though the SOSSS part of our Slate slate normally supports telescreens, were not sure the rest of the campus does.  We wish to take a poll of the Campus campus and ask them, Do you think that the television in the Memorial Union MU, which broadcasts what is essentially advertising, belongs in a university, given how much money it makes for ASUCD?  We think your opinion is important, and we will listen to all public opinion polls as they represent the opinion of the campus in general, not just ASUCD politicos.



 Campus Entertainment 
  Old Firehouse Venue for Music Performances:: A long time ago, one Slate slate promised the Old Firehouse to be used as a new venue for Davis Music Scene events.  However, that Slate slate has a history of breaking the public trust, thus it is not surprising that they broke this campaign promise as well.  Promusic candidate Rob Roy will fight for use of this building as a new venue, bringing more culture to Campus campus.


It was my understanding that the building was going to be http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/23/Arts/Senate.Candidates.Address.Campus.Entertainment1319674.shtml?norewrite200607310439&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com destroyed and that they were going to build somehting else. I dont think that this issue is the fault of Student Focus, (conviencing the university to not tear down a bulding and build something useful would be difficult at best) and that the above paragraph is a misguided Shadiness Factor cheapshot. Then again, Kalen Gallagher Kalen could have lied about the campus plans.  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen
   Last I heard the building was going to be used for the Technocultural Studies program. Users/PhilipNeustrom

  More Entertainment Council Events:: The ASUCD Entertainment Council needs more money, so it can put on more events.  This would include more concerts by all kinds of artists not allowed in the Mondavi Center, as well as more free movie previews which have been extremely popular on Campus campus.  We are, after all, the Slate slate of bread and circuses.


 Student Services 
  More Unitrans or Tipsy Taxi Runs:: Weve all been there.  You need a ride on Unitrans or Tipsy Taxi, and its nowhere to be found.  Unitrans runs stop at midnight, and Tipsy Taxi has only one dispatcher to handle the demand.  However, this is the time when most people will be too drunk to drive home.  We think that there should be increased service at this time to prevent drunk driving and offer more alternative tranportation.  Friends Urging Campus Kindness will investigate this, and see which program would be most effective in transporting people from a party to their homes.  This might require something like a $1 fee for Unitrans on late runs, but it would be worth it in terms of the safety and kindness you would bring to the campus.  Also, we will investigate Sunday Unitrans runs (probably (P/Q lines) &#8211; not everyone in Banduhtrans! could possibly party every weekend.


  Staplers in the Computer Labs:: It should be obvious that people will want to Campus Staplers staple things in the computer labs after theyve printed them out.  However, there are no Campus Staplers staplers in the labs.  Weve heard that they were stolen in the past, and weve come up with a brilliant solution: bolt them down.  We have already written a bill allocating a couple hundred dollars from Capital Reserves to buy some Campus Staplers staplers for the labs.  Solving the little annoyances in student life should be the domain of student government.


  Promoting Campus Safety:: It seems to us that there are already plenty of programs that increase safety on campus, and few people know about them.  Selfdefense classes are taught through the Womens Center, and Aggie Hosts already provides an Campus Safety Escort Service Escort Service at night.  Publicity of these resources already available to people would really help improve Campus Kindness.  We will also look at funding the Womens Center and the LGBTRC LGBT Resource Center in any programs they have to promote tolerance and decrease sexual assault.

  Book Prices:: It would be nice to take advantage of the free market when it comes to purchasing books for our classes. Currently, most students do not know what books are required for a particular class until the first day of lecture. Usually, there are assignments or readings required relatively soon after that day. This usually leaves just enough time to go to the Campus campus bookstore to purchase the book at its (relatively high) price. In order to allow students to shop around for the best price from competing vendors, a hallmark of our free market society, we propose that the student government compile a list of all required texts for all possible classes for each quarter and publish them on a central web site, including ISBN numbers, before the start of the quarter to allow all students enough time to look around for the best price. This would increase competition among all vendors and ultimatly lead to lower prices for the students.


  Reclaim the MU 5th Floor:: Though there are property insurance issues involved with people on the roof of Memorial Union, it is obvious that it was designed to accomodate people.  Since the radioactive KDVS antenna is no longer on the roof, we feel that everyone should be allowed to be on the 5^th^ Floor Patio.  It is, after all, a student union owned by ASUCD.



SECRET AGENDA: Campus Kindness
  Social Revolution:: If theres one thing that Davis needs, its a social revolution.  We want a new culture, a new philosophy, and a new birth of freedom.  Were not exactly sure how to accomplish this, but it will probably involve pot and/or Project Mayhem.


  More Redwood Trees on Campus:: Okay, we know these trees just suck up the water in the summer, but theyre very nice, and add a great feel to the Campus campus.  Redwood trees are the heart of California, and have a soul all their own.  Besides, what other contribution can you make that will show Campus Kindness long after youre dead?


  Terraforming:: We think that life in Davis would be greatly improved if we just installed some hills and an ocean.  A minigolf course would be great among such features.  As cardcarrying members of the Bavarian Illuminati fnord, our slate members will support all current plans for changing Davis geography, if they exist.


  Clean Up Putah Creek:: Just because of its name, the body of water doesnt have to be as dirty as an old puta.  Wed like the campus to clean it up, and make water actually flow through there.  There is definitely not enough Campus Kindness for the fish, and we friends are urging more kindness.

  At first, i thought this was just as redicilous as terraforming. Theyve drained Putah in the past, only to have it become green once again. Solution: Make feeding the ducks in the Arboretum punishable by a $150 fine, and enforce it. Feeding the ducks ruins everything and people who do it should be fed to the ducks, but we can settle for fines.  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen
     I think the solution is not victimizing the ducks, but installing floating aeration pumps. These can be seen in ponds shooting jets of water into the air. People think theyre decorative, but in fact theyre there to get oxygen into the water, thus sterilizing unwanted microbes and keeping the pond clear. Users/SteveDavison

20050127 22:19:42 nbsp We should be planting Valley Oaks, not redwoods. Users/JackHaskel

20050128 16:05:21 nbsp I agree about the oaks. Native plants should be given preference over nonnative generally, and the main focus should be on minimizing upkeep costs such as watering. Users/RevChad

20050202 14:06:33 nbsp I love the idea of Senate meetings in the CoHo. Users/RishiTrivedi

20050203 02:50:10 nbsp but what about sudden oak death??? Users/LisaDavis

20050203 08:13:05 nbsp Last I heard, the Valley Oak was not one of the species effected by Sudden Oak Death Syndrome. My main point was that we should be planting native species. This is a small issue though. Users/JackHaskel

20050203 10:41:24 nbsp i think lisa was refering to the band sudden oak death Users/RobRoy

20050203 10:47:52 nbsp Hey, FYI, Tipsy Taxi has two dispatchers working on Friday and Saturday (theres no need for more than one on Thursdays) what Tipsy Taxi need are more phone lines, I think they only have two now, though it could be one. Users/AbbyLawson

20050204 00:01:02 nbsp This is a very elaborate platform. I likes. Users/JanineFiel

20050210 22:50:01 nbsp I dont especially agree/understand with your right to party stance. Other people should be considered too! And there is probably no problem with your right to party unless youre making so much noise the neighbors are annoyed.. Users/EugeniaWong

20050211 23:08:34 nbsp Dear Eugenia: When we say right to party we do not meab right to disturb those around you. This is one reason why we request that the city be more business friendly and allow a private club to open and get partyers out of the residential areas. We also want to bring music to campus, so it doesnt have to be at Rob Roys house. Users/RevChad

20050211 23:18:18 nbsp Hey all, I have been looking into the office on the first floor idea. They just closed it because no one was going in it so they thought it was a waste of money, but I think it would be totally different if senators were in the office. Lets work together on it. :) Users/JanineFiel

20050211 23:27:47 nbsp Hey all, I was just wondering what kind of exact plans you have for implementing some of this stuff, like getting a printer in senate meetings, and getting more unitrans buses at night. Who have you talked to in terms of getting staplers in labs and getting back toilet seat covers in bathrooms because these types of things deal a lot with adminstration and univeristy laws etc. Just hinting if you havent already to talk to all these people, places, units, etc that you want to improve etc before hand so you know the feasibility of the issues. I love the ideas and would love to see a lot of this happen, but there is a lot of redtape and talking you have to go through and if you want you can start working on it all now. Users/JanineFiel

20050211 23:42:59 nbsp Dear Janine: The printer would be easy, as anyone with a small printer and a laptop could just pring them, or other printing arangements can be made as long as it is made clear to the public who to talk to even if we use one of the many printers on the 3rd floor. We talked to the unitrans director about extended night service. He already planned to extend at least one line an hour and seemed very accepting of extending others if funding is given. Staplers we are having a small problem with as the people in charge of the ComLabs are avoiding us. We hope they will do this less as senators. Toilet seat covers we havent looked into yet in our very limited time. Thank you for your feed back. Users/RevChad

20050211 23:44:21 nbsp PS: Let us know how you would like us to help with the 1st floor senate office. Users/RevChad

20050218 16:22:26 nbsp In regard to having 18 Senators elected, I think you have made the right decision in tabling that for the time being. The more feasible plan would be 13 or 15 but one should look at what it would take to get elected as the number of votes might be too low. Users/JonathonLeathers

20050219 02:58:30 nbsp I am concerned about the qualifications of those on your slate. I admit that I have not had much contact with you, but from my experiences I feel that those that I have met are not qualified for such a position. Those that I have met may not have been candidates, but they still represent your slate. The qualifications of other candidates can be questioned, but they still DO possess rudimentary public speaking skills. Those that have represented your slate to me often lacked this. You even lack to mention your qualifications, with only Mr. Leathers and Mr. Hernandez stating experience in a leadership position of a student government within their personal statement. Granted, senate can be dramatically improved, but the changes you aim for must be pushed by strong leaders, which to this day I have not seen. Please prove me wrong. If elected, I do hope your leaders will accomplish their goals and not default on weak premises.  Users/EricWu
   Rob Roy: Manager of Ben & Jerrys for over 5 years, underwriting director of KDVS, and __terrific public speaker__.  Have you talked to this guy?  He stole the show at the ASUCD Elections Forum.  He has also authored legislation that was passed by the ASUCD Senate Senate.
   Teresa Kenny: General Manager of KDVS.  Thats a lot of work.  The general manager does a lot.  She managed all of KDVS, and KDVS is freaking HUGE.
   Pedro youd already mentioned.
   Kristen Birdsall has no former leadership positions, you are correct.
   Theres no way youve talked to Mohammad Yahya Rouhani because he is extremely convincing and passionate in his speaking.
   Chad Van Schoelandt hasnt held any leadership positions.  Chad has, however, worked with the ASUCD Senate Senate to pass important elections reform legislation.
   You have not talked to Paul Ivanov because he is an absolutely terrific public speaker.

As for speaking with people who are not candidates but are instead representing the slate, I would like to remind you that those people should not be acting as representives but instead as advisors and contributors of ideas to candidates (and Im sorry if you werent impressed with their speaking skills). See Users/PhilipNeustrom my page for more of my personal opinion of these candidates.  I encourage you to speak with the candidates yourself and see that they are qualified, open, and interesting people that will hopefully bring meaningful change to the association.

20050220 23:23:29 nbsp Eric: I tend to want politics to be about ideas, but since you ask about leadership and such, I have been an officer with Students for an Orwellian Society since me and Brent Laabs founded the Davis Chapter. I think we are quite accomplished and I have done an AG t.v. interview for that club, as well as speaking before the senate about my election reform. The election reform was a large group effort which I played a major role in coordinating and setting the agenda for. You can also judge my public speaking from the candidates forum. As a philosophy major and agrumentative hobbyist I have learned a decent level of persuasive speaking and actual reasoning. Feel free to find me tuesday as I will be tabling with Rob at noon on the quad, and you can ask me about any other qualifications. Users/RevChad

20050605 20:47:07 nbsp Maybe graphics for achieved/in progress?  Its in the text in any case. Users/BrentLaabs

20050807 10:29:40 nbsp With regards to extending Unitrans and Tipsy Taxi time, do you ever consider that the drivers and dispatchers are also students?  And that this will cost more money for paying for wages, the bus, the extra fuel?  Have you asked any of the drivers and supervisors if they are willing to now give up their Sundays to run more service?  Please remember that were students also with classes and homework.

20051022 17:06:57 nbsp Walkup computer terminals (i.e. running Firefox) in the MU hallways, and King lounge. Most other Student Unions Ive visited have walkup computers scattered where there is foot traffic, not just in designated computer rooms. They are very popular. People just walk up to one, check their email, and in 5 minutes are gone. This is the way ubiquitous computer access should be. No hassle. Users/SteveDavison

20051022 18:57:20 nbsp Can we get some estimates on how much these walk up computers will cost, and how would the cash be produced? Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20051022 19:04:38 nbsp I suggest you ask LEAD that.  Its on their agenda. Users/BrentLaabs

20081016 03:54:10 nbsp I just spent the last few hours reading about F.U.C.K. and I love everything it stands for, I would greatly support the revival of this slate!
Any old members still around wanna revive it legally? Id definitely volunteer to help out! Users/mperkel
