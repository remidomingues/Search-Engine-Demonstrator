The Pond is an enhanced wetland wildlife habitat, while its primary purpose is to retain stormwater runoff and help prevent flooding. In the dry months, water is provided by a supplementary well at the SW corner of the Pond. The Pond is enclosed by a security fence and is designated a Wildlife Preserve and Sensitive Habitat Area by the City of Davis. Native trees and shrubs grow on the slopes around the Pond and provide habitat for a diversity of wildlife. The Public Works Public Works Dept. manages the water levels and vegetation inside the fenced area and maintains the Greenbelt.

Want to go inside the fence? In September, on CA Coast and Waterways Cleanup Day, we go inside the metal fence around the Pond and pick up trash and recyclables. Its more fun than it sounds! Watch for the announcement in The Davis Enterprise and on our Facebook page.

 Watch Wildlife 



Join Gene Trapp and Ralph Hunter on the first Wed. of every month for a twohour birding and botanizing walk in the West Pond area. Walks start at the Gazebo at the park at the west end of Isle Royale Ln. at 9AM, OctMay, and at 8AM, JuneSept. Walks are cosponsored by The Friends of West Pond and the Yolo Audubon Society. The beauty of monthly visits to a specific location is an increased understanding of the seasonal variation in plant and animal activities. Please bring a pair of binoculars and join us on these walks.


The Greenbelt is perfect for Birds and Bird Watching birdwatching all year around.
