In February 2005 the Frog Signs were taken down.  They were seen from Interstate 80 Westbound coming into Davis. Done in a style like the Burma Shave signs that were prevalent during the Route 66 days (1930s to early 1960s), they were put up by Lyon Real Estate, a local Real Estate company owned by 1977 UC Davis graduate Mike Lyon. The signs were also visible from the Bike Paths bike trail that goes between Davis and Sacramento (also via County Road 32).  The signs seemingly glowed and sparkled at Night Time night, and were the most visible display of the citys commitment to being a Nuclear Free Zone nuclear free zone.





 

The new signs are:









20050125 22:48:51 nbsp Im not so sure about the nuclear free what with the crocker NUCLEAR lab at uc davis Users/BryanBell
20050125 23:26:19 nbsp all you see at night is the frog...its creepy.  Nuclear free is an odd thing to advertise about a town...unless the town was near Chernobyl or something. Users/RohiniJasavala

20050126 00:02:54 nbsp maybe they are trying to say that Davis population is composed primarily of Prokaryotes Users/RaynatoCastro

20050126 11:48:10 nbsp I seem to remember more signs a few years ago, but I could be mistaken. Users/TarZxf


20050207 13:08:45 nbsp I am so sad... Gone is a Davis landmark. Im glad someone took the pictures before the signs were taken down. Users/SummerSong

20050207 14:58:39 nbsp Too bad they are gone. I was looking forward to seeing the signs when I travel to CA this Spring.  Users/BradCuppy

20050208 10:51:39 nbsp Now they have crappy new signs.  Theyre really crappy.  Their new ones have something to do with faery tales.  And also does anyone know anything about the Keep out hazardous materials EPA Superfund Site on 2nd street? Users/JaimeRaba

20050209 19:30:49 nbsp As annoying as they were at 12am on a Saturday night after clubbing i have to admit i will miss the neon frogs boasting about the non existant nuclear free Davis. Users/ArlishaAdams

20050209 20:38:02 nbsp Well, I think technically, the University is not actually part of Davis, but is somehow carved out of the boundaries of the city. Users/JaimeRaba

20050210 00:09:50 nbsp Id also like to know about that EPA Superfund Site Superfund site on 2nd street. Users/EdPereira

20050210 02:50:15 nbsp I am really sad that theyre gone... Users/AnnieLastname

20050210 15:57:33 nbsp Ed  I explained the Superfund site if youre curious. Users/JabberWokky

20050211 00:27:33 nbsp The Nuclear in Nuclear Free refers to the citys relationship with the creation of nuclear weapons, not ALL nuclear reactions in general. Thatd be pretty hard to be free of. Users/JesseSingh

20050211 19:57:29 nbsp http://ehs.ucdavis.edu/enviro/lehr.cfm  The university apparently conducted radiation testing on beagles. Users/AraAroyan

20050212 15:26:35 nbsp Those new signs are so commerical!  Theres no mention of Davis at all.  Also, I think there were 5 frog signs, werent there? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050212 16:11:39 nbsp Im pretty sure the 5th frog sign just showed one of the frogs sitting next to a sign with the Lyon logo and address on it.  Users/KayRide

20050212 16:12:39 nbsp Awww...I havent seen that the frogs were gone.  The new ones are lame. Users/BevSykes

20050212 19:07:08 nbsp I like the frogs. The new signs, they suck ! Users/BradCuppy

20050212 20:08:22 nbsp The frogs worked better because they shared a common visual theme and had a more readable and uniformly sized lettering. The new ones dont feel like they honor the Burma Shave tradition. Users/JasonAller

20050315 18:48:32 nbsp There was one more sign first.  It said something like, Why did the toad cross the road? Users/AllisonEriksen

20050319 16:01:08 nbsp Takoma Park in DC advertises that they are Nuclear Free too.  I think its some pseudohippiecatering thing. Users/JenDockter

20051022 09:29:50 nbsp I preferred the frog signs too. Users/SteveDavison

20051101 16:36:23 nbsp The City of Davis has declared itself nuclearfree, but it cant enforce that policy on Universityowned land. It does enforce it on cityowned roads, however, and that can make it difficult to transport radioactively labelled materials between University locations, regardless of the safety. Users/MattCzarnowski

20080723 00:12:01 nbsp The city of Davis, of course, does not permit the use of sunlight for heat, power generation, growth of food, or generally helping people to see, since photons emitted through a nuclear fusion process are not permitted in a nuclear free zone.  ;) Users/IDoNotExist
  Nor use smoke detectors, fluorescent watches and clocks, radioisotopes used in tomography, or allow the irradiation of food for sterilization.  Users/JoePomidor

20080723 09:39:04 nbsp Not to troll, but it looks like Im the only one who likes the new signs better than the old signs.  I found the frogs garish and embarrassing (Lyon at the end of the tunnel?! Cmon...).  The new signs have a cute theme, sane colors, and much better branding.  Maybe a bit less Burma Shaveesque, but the old ones didnt follow the form too exactly, either. Users/MattJurach

20100212 08:51:03 nbsp The signs were extremely corny and garish... and I miss them :)  They were yet another one of those quirky, crazy things that makes Davis Davis. Users/TomGarberson
