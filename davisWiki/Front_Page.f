##   Community Alerts
##  Before enabling a community alert consider if it would be better as a Featured Page or Event.  Community alerts are ultrahigh profile emergency notices regarding very time sensitive and temporary items such as boil water orders, weather alerts or a missing child.  Try to keep them limited to items that the people living in Davis should all be alerted to, no matter who they are.  Think of it as the Wiki emergency broadcast system.
