While some like to eat their dessert, others prefer it in the form of a frozen drink.  Theyre especially delicious during Davis hot Summer.


 NonAlcoholic 

 Slurpees 

Slurpees are only available at 7Eleven mini markets, such as the one on L Street.  7Eleven licensed the frozen drink from the Icee Corporation in 1967 and began selling the frozen carbonated product in its stores under the name Slurpee. Some people use the name Slurpee to refer to any similar beverage, but a true connoisseur knows the difference.

Available only at:
  7Eleven

 Icees 

Icees are available at many places.  Some would lump them in the same category as Slurpees, however, the main difference is in texture (Slurpees being gritty, and Icees being more...liquidy).
