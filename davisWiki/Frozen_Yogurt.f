The Dining Commons used to serve frozen yogurt years ago. However, they switched to soft serve ice cream from frozen yogurt.

Frozen yogurt is usually made from a powder which usually comes in aluminized plastic bags. Just dump it into the machine. It adds water, mixes it, and freezes it while agitating it (to keep the ice crystals small). Nothing you cant do with a blender at home. Powder mixes are usually used by retail establishments since they dont require refrigeration and are easier to store and ship.

Unfortunately, frozen yogurt does not have an FDA standard definition (as there is for plain http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2001/aprqtr/pdf/21cfr131.200.pdf yogurt). One can even buy http://www.metrocandy.com/YOGURTPEANUTS candycoated peanuts or http://www.candy.com/YogurtCoveredPretzels25LBCase_p_179.html yogurtcoated pretzels in health food stores since yogurt is considered healthful. For true yogurt  and associated health benefits  look for the term http://aboutyogurt.com live & active cultures on the label. Yogurt sold in the refrigerated dairy sections of supermarkets meets this criteria. Whether any of the frozen yogurt listed here fits that is questionable. Frozen yogurt sounds so much more healthful than soft serve. Typical frozen yogurt ingredients are sugar, whey powder (from milk), xanthan gum (thickener), flavoring, and coloring.

$.39/oz. is approx. $52.07/gallon compare with Davis Food Coop water at $.39/gallon!

Note: There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon, but a gallon of water weighs 133.52 ounces. Go figure.
  Actually, a fluid ounce is a measure of volume, whereas as an ounce is a measure of mass. Also, if you weighed a gallon of water, you may not be taking into account the weight of the container. Users/TheShah SS

20100205 11:42:38 nbsp The frozen yogurt craze has begun anew.  Does anyone remember how big frozen yogurt shops were in the 80s? Users/DagonJones
  I do, though the yogurt tasted different then.  It is definitely better now.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100206 10:38:35 nbsp The selfserve prices are ridiculously high.  Youd think with so many places in Davis now, some would eventually go down. Pretty much everywhere else theres a ton of froyo shops (especially over socal) you tend to see 28 / 30 /33 cents per ounce.  The price differences add up! Users/EdWins
