Iteration Matt :: Frrrau Schnibbitt


There was also one of these on the Shamash on March 10^th^ 2005. Were there any other elsewhere?


About 500 of 10 types were made and most were posted on the night of March 9^th^, 2005, after the Tragic Events memorial for Matthew Godwin.  The flyers on the engineering side of campus seem to have survived much better than less geeky areas.
