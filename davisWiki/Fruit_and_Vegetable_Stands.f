One great reason to check out the county roads on the outskirts outskirts of town is the great fruit and vegetable stands.  These are often the absolute best place to get your fruits and veggies; although the variety can be slim at the smaller ones, the larger ones are better than the produce section at a Supermarkets & Grocery Stores grocery store.

The Yolo Fruit Stand, Ikedas, and Pedrick Produce are the more commercial of these stands, but others are seasonal, transient, and may even move locations from year to year.  Also, dont forget the Farmers Market!  See the article, http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2005/05/25/news/229new0.txt Pull Over for Produce, in The Davis Enterprise  it talks about Ikedas, the Yolo Fruit Stand, and others. Bounty and Savings maintains http://www.bountynsavings.com/category/farmersmarket/ reviews on fruit stands around Davis, and the Sacramento Farmers Market under the Freeway.


These stands are a good reason to take local county roads to places like Woodland, so you can stop on the way.  A few places to keep on your route:

  Cloverleaf at Bridgeway Farms
  FL Strawberries, aka That Strawberry Place  County Road 31 Rd. 31 / West Covell Boulevard just before County Road 98 Rd. 98   Same intersection as Grandpas Barn, with Strawberries sold ten feet from where they are grown
  Grandpas Barn / Impossible Acres  County Road 31 Rd. 31 / West Covell Boulevard and County Road 98 Rd. 98    New and expanding retail side of Impossible Acres Upick.  Prepicked fruits from Impossible Acres as well as specialty garlic and other veggies from neighboring farms.  Also affiliated with the Barnyard Theatre.  In the Autumn months, Impossible Acres is a popular pumpkin patch.
  Pacific Star Gardens has seasonal fruit and vegetables in a perennial covered area 1/3 mile south of County Road 25A Road 25A  on County Road 99 Rd. 99 . Also a UPick area.
  Sometimes, a smallscale, personal stand that looks like an overgrown lemonade stand on County Road 99 Rd. 99  just north of County Road 25A Road 25A  appears, offering a variety of very local veggies.
  There is a strawberry stand on Putah Creek Road, just west of its intersection with Railroad Ave coming south out of Winters over the bridge.  The strawberries are grown in the field next to the stand.  Easily accessible for those biking to Winters, or walking the town.

 

20050619 14:12:15 nbsp Does anyone know where the Fruit Stand  that is Under the Freeway in Sacramento is? I am always looking to buy fresh, red Pasilla Chilles but have not been able to find them anywhere. My old room mate got a few at this mysterious location.... but blah... I think my room mate got the name of this pepper wrong. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050619 15:36:41 nbsp doing a little googling, it looks like it is on Sundays between W & X streets and somewhere between 5th and 8th street. Users/RogerClark

20061226 16:51:15 nbsp Ive been there, but its a farmers market and I cant tell you where it is as I was driven. Its on Sundays, a lot cheaper than the Davis farmers market with a lot of the same vendors. Bigger too, with lots of things Davis doesnt have.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070819 22:18:40 nbsp If you do go to the sac farmers market, check out the Kumamoto oysters.  Theyre a steal at 12 for $8.  Users/atwong
