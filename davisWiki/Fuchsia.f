Fuchsias are herbaceous plants populating the genus Fuchsia, named  in 1703 after German botanist Leonhard Fuchs (1501Â–1566). Fuchsias belong to the eveningprimrose family (Onagraceae) and include about 100 species and thousands of cultivars native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, New Zealand and Tahiti. Fuchsias are grown as perennial garden shrubs in Davis and other mild climates, and flower almost continuously from spring to fall.

The belllike fuchsia flowers hang downwards and have long stamens and an extremely long style. Oftentimes, fuchsia blooms are bicolor with the sepals one color and the corolla a different color. Flower color can be almost any combination of white, pink, red, magenta and purple. The flowers attract hummingbirds, Honeybees, and the fruits are eaten by Birds and bird watching birds. In Davis, fuchsias provide wonderful color in shady gardens which protect the frost, heat and humiditysensitive plants.

Fuchsias are heavyfeeders, benefiting from regular fertilizer applications, and can be propagated by seed or stem tip cuttings. Whiteflies are the fuchsias most common insect pest but other Town Wildlife pests are aphids, thrips, mealybugs, spider mites and scale insects.
