But remember to get there at least half an hour or so before lunch, otherwise youll have to wait in a heinously long line. Sometimes the line starts forming as early as 10:00AM and by 11:30AM there will be upwards of 50 people waiting.  On the other hand, because of the bar, even when the restaurant is busy, this is a solo dining friendly spot to eat.

Since March 8, 2008 Fuji Chef also offers a dinner buffet. Its $17.95 and includes either tea or a soda and miso soup. Also, for dinner you can get grilled salmon, fried oysters, fried squid, and other items.

Sushi, pickled cucumbers, occasional fried items, and edamame are premade and placed on boats, which float in a circular horseshoe fashion around the bar. They dont tell you this at the door, but you can also request any other (sushi) menu item by directly asking the chefs. This includes all of their specialty rolls (such as Davis roll), fried soft shell crab, sashimi, fried oysters, and fried bananas.  Remember to tip.  Theyre extra nice to regulars, too.

Unfortunately Fuji Chef was featured on channel 3s http://www.kcra.com/news/15238831/detail.html expose on sushi restaurants who do not serve the species of fish they advertise. Fujis snapper nigiri was genetically analyzed to be tilapia, a fish that is at a minimum one sixth the price of red snapper. If you want to avoid this trickery at a buffet you are out of luck, Nobu Hiro was also caught doing the same.

Also remember to use the bathrooms bathroom before going there.  The single womens bathroom toilet isnt exactly stable.

Definitely not the best sushi in town during the buffet. Everything tastes like its been sitting out for a while, because it has been. If you are going for sheer quantity over quality this is place to go, even though Nobu Hiro has a better quality sushi and no wait for about the same price. Users/AshleyOrsaba

  Actually, Nobu Hiro is cheaper than Fuji Chef.  It costs $8.99 for allyoucaneat while Fujis costs $1.00 more from MonThurs and $2.00 more from FriSun.  Users/RobertBaron

   Fuji seems to have a larger variety of sushi though.  I got bored eating the same things at Nobu after a while.


20050518 17:10:10 nbsp It always amazes me that this place has such a long line! Its not even close to being the best sushi available in Davis, though at least they must turn over their sushi pretty quickly. Having grown up eating sushi and being something of a purist, I have to admit that Im always wary of allyoucaneat sushi... sushi is about freshness and quality, not quantity. Anyway, before you sell your soul to Fuji, try almost any other sushi place in town for about the same price and better quality food. Users/AlphaDog

20050625 17:21:20 nbsp Although I can understand that its not for the sushi gourmet, its definitely tasty.  I highly recommend the Davis Roll (think everything in one sushi roll...mmm), along with the Fried Ebi.  Honestly, if youre willing to come earlier in the morning (rather than closer to when they close), there is an excellent variety and everything has just been made. Users/JulieEickhof

20050727 23:07:41 nbsp This place is not nearly as good as Nobu Hiro Nobu.  Nobu has very fresh meat, and the staff there are very friendly.  Fujis meat is just a tiny bit tougher, and their prices are more expensive than Nobus.  I like how Fujis offers sashimi, while Nobu does not (they actually charge more for that I think). Users/MindyYang

20050728 11:00:17 nbsp Well, I always get a red rash when I eat here.  Maybe I have a sensitivity to something they use?  Dont get this at Moshi Moshi, my favorite place in town. Users/JaimeRaba
 20050904 16:09:57 nbsp The red rash you say youre getting (Users/JaimeRaba) is probably an allergy to MSG.  It probably wont be in the raw fish stuff, but you should really look online for more information about MSG (and other sneakilynamed things like hydrolyzed vegetable protein).  Im not very sensitive to it, so it takes a lot to make me notice.  (Additionally, I wouldnt recommend Jusco for that reason; again, Im not that sensitive to MSG and my eyes were all puffy the next day.) Users/JulieEickhof

20050816 20:25:33 nbsp Cant say the cheap toaster oven they apparently use to reheat stuff on the sushi island makes the place very high class. Expect a thin film of yuck on the boat fish after normal lunch and dinner hours. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051214 10:16:53 nbsp Way to crowded at lunch as much as I want to eat there I havent had the chance to stand in that fun huge line! Users/LorenFinazzo

hehe, got there at 10 in the morning and there was a boy there saying his dad left him in line at 8, said he would be back for lunch, those lines are crazy

20060207 14:42:27 nbsp This sushi place ties for last on my list of favorite sushi restaurants in Davis. I never take advantage of the sushi buffet because I could never eat enough sushi to make it worth it, and when I order the rolls, they are nothing special. The rice and the fish doesnt taste very fresh, and Im not a fan of the sauces they put over the rolls. Once again, this place ties with Juscos across the street, and I would only eat here if I were starving and didnt care about the quality of the sushi. Users/LauraChan

  Are you kidding me?  Jusco is the absolute worst sushi place Ive ever been to.  I must admit that Ive was given some very iffy fish once at Fuji and I dont care for the sauces either, but its usually not that bad.  You can also ask them to not put the sauces on.

20060220 02:29:28 nbsp This place opened up back when I was a freshman.  After four years, the quality of the sushi has noticeably declined (tuna, salmon, hamachi, snapper) or Ive become pickier.  Theres a very noticeable fishy taste, a sign that they might be using leftover fish from the previous dinner.  Still, the gyoza (potstickers), honeyglazed skewered chicken, shrimp tempura, and softshelled crab are good cooked items.  Especially the softshelled crab, its almost a unique Fuji specialty.  Even if theyve increased their prices a bit, its still a great deal. Users/CurtisLim

20060402 21:29:18 nbsp Wait an hour (or more) for bad sushi in a crowded restaurant  I dont get it ... Users/HarrySpanglet

20060409 02:27:15 nbsp I enjoyed their sweet potato sushi, however, they behaved shadily when it came to charging me. They gave me one of my 1.95~ pieces of sushi on a 2.45~ plate, and proceded to bill me at the higher amount. Having gone there with a very tight budget, I didnt let them slip that by me, but I worry about how many other people they might do that to. I dont see any other comments about that here, so it might have been a random error. Still, keep your eyes open. Users/JosephBleckman

20060721 13:00:19 nbsp i really enjoy the selection at fujis. when i go to nobu the sushi makers have attitude and their water always tastes bad. fujis is a good place and i have been eating sushi ever since i could eat solid food. nobus quality hasnt always been consistent and the other good places just dunk their sushi in a tub full of sauce. Users/RiyoKwong

20060814 12:46:55 nbsp Okay, the funny thing is, to all you sushi conniseurs who act like youre above the sushi buffet thats provided at Fujis, Im willing to bet 80% of you got your first taste of sushi at Fujis. Most of you would probably have never touched sushi unless you were in a buffet enviornment. The sushi here is not as fresh as Nobu Hiro or Mikunis, but what do you expect, its a sushi buffet for like $11. The variety is excellent, and as far as I am concerned, the sushi tastes great. P.S.: I dont work at Fujis or anything, Im just sick of people acting cool and saying this or that is better than Fujis, when fujis is clearly the most popular sushi joint in town. Users/ArlenKwong

20060914 16:07:25 nbsp Fujis has made me very sick the two times I have been there. Their food is not fresh and the rice in the rolls I had was undercooked. Im not allergic to MSG or anything it was food poisoning, plain and simple.  Users/RathyMarie

20060915 11:02:59 nbsp Ive been to Fujis _several_ times in the last 4 years or so, and Ive been there with _lots_ of friends. Not one of us has ever gotten sick. Ever. Its a fun place to eat and maybe the best sushi buffet youll ever encounter, especially for the price! If you hit them up during buffet hours their stuff is fairly fresh (not sure how anything can get that old considering how high the turnover is) With this said and done, youd be kidding yourself if you said their sushi was comparable with nicer sushi places. This should be obvious, does your $7 steak from Dennys taste as good as something from a place like Black Angus? Try ordering some nigiri from MoshiMoshi or Zen Toro and see the difference yourself. Users/TheodoreSuryapurnama

20060915 12:56:31 nbsp Im in Wisconsin and I miss this place!  There are tons of drunks in Milwaukee but no cheap sushi!  The only times Ive ever gotten sick after eating here were times when I was already sick before. Users/MarieHuynh

20060924 21:30:21 nbsp I love this place, but I think I would get sick of it if I went everyday. I suppose being far from Davis has its advantages because it just makes me crave the sushi buffet even more. Boy I wish it were Christmas Break or something so I could go up there for this place. Users/SteveNgo

20061017 15:16:07 nbsp Granted Fuji is popular because it is a great Japanese value but if you want great Japanese FOOD go to Mirai. Users/KevinRobinson

20061126 22:14:59 nbsp Went to their lunch buffet for the first time a few weeks ago.  Have to say that its a lot better than the one at Nobu Hiro.  I wouldnt eat any sashimi though. who knows how long its been sitting out. Users/PorkFoo

20061213 21:11:35 nbsp I love the roatating boats.  It reminds me of the sushi buffets in Japan (if you can call them buffets, you have to pay for each dish).  The food here is not great quality, but the quantity of course is outstanding.  They are very apt to please here and will make you basically any roll or nigiri your heart desires.  The line is daunting, but once you get in its really a great place to eat. Users/JohnHumperdinkle

20070107 19:45:09 nbsp Just an fyi, I went today and saw this fat white dude standing outside basically trying to sneak in the line while everyone moved in. I told him to go to the back of the line, he just smiled like an idiot but somehow he still got in later on. Be wary of people like him... And I wonder why no one in line bothered to tell him to get the fuck out. Users/ArlenKwong

20070121 12:59:24 nbsp This place is always super cracking, its amazing how long the line is 45 minutes before they open Users/StevenDaubert

20070202 03:24:04 nbsp Food is decent, if not outstanding. The long lines are bearable but if you are seated near or facing the entrance prepare to recieve piercing glares from impatient patronsinline. You would do well to avoid the sashimi or just the fish itself, but in combos like the Dragon or Davis rolls it could be quite tastey. I live within walking distance of Moshi Moshi (fabulous place) in south Davis but rarely dine there because budgetary concerns. At Fujis, it is really a matter of quantity over quality but, a budget conscious student like me would do well to appreciate the value at Fuji Chefs. Users/JasonVien

20070202 09:34:55 nbsp Does anyone have any insight about which days of the week are better than others, or their delivery schedule? Ive found the fish to be good on Mondays and Fridays, but especially bad on Thursdays. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070206 13:40:25 nbsp Can not believe people wait in such long lines to eat here. Blah. I guess its the quantity of sushi you get for your money. Save up your money and eat some GOOD sushi at Moshi Moshi.   Users/SueJones

20070315 14:15:32 nbsp Only thing i hate about Fujis is the line.  Id rate Nobus higher then Fujis though. Users/DonaldJaye

20070316 16:01:49 nbsp fuji is NOT sushi! its an american crappy version of sushi. the rolls are full of mayonaise, and nothing is fresh.  the line is long, and youre eating food that has been floating around in front of a bunch of college students bacteria ridden hands.  this is seriously the worst sushi option in town! Users/JossieDiel

20070330 16:00:02 nbsp I havent tried the buffet yet but the sushi is excellent. I have heard rave reviews about the buffet, although there is a bit of a wait. Users/GreenThing

20070411 21:34:02 nbsp Its pretty good for a buffet restaurant, even though you just end up eating the same stuff over and over. The services isnt so good. But what do you expect from a buffet.  Users/jes

20070415 12:15:26 nbsp Totally at a loss regarding the popularity of the place. Ive lived in Davis 6 years, and my analysis of the situation is: #1) These students must have FAT bank accounts. $1112? Nice. FYI  check out one of the taquerias for a $5 burrito that will get you farther, or if youre hell bent on sushi, theres better quality sushi in town. Not sure if I EVER spent that much on lunch when I was a student, and I would certainly not deal with annoying crowds to pay that amount. How much sushi can you really eat? NICE. #2) OK, I get it. Its cool. Yeah, meaning, its cool to hang in the line, be seen there, etc. After all, your friends are going there, you better go too. #3) Thanks for the entertainment.   Users/KeithJose

20070415 18:16:57 nbsp The buffets are great if you want to eat lots of sushi.  You definitely get more for your money here than other sushi places.  I agree that sometimes the quality of the fish is questionable.  Good service though! Users/GoAggies!

20070502 12:51:06 nbsp not the best in town, but you pay for what you get, therefore the only good time for Fujis is their lunchtime buffet. Otherwise there are better locations for dinner such as Osaka, Moshi Moshi, or Nobu Hiro ) Users/trambajuice

20070502 20:36:08 nbsp Apparently, everyone goes here for the all you can eat sushi? My partner and I went here for an ordinary meal, but was not impressed by the service (which was terrible; dishes were forgotten, and then forgotten again) or the food. One sushi ordered was clearly premade some time ago. The teriyaki sauce was flavorless; meat was low quality. We are unlikely to return. Users/CovertProfessor

20070519 12:01:48 nbsp I hadnt been here in about 3 years and finally tried the Lunch buffet again. After eating here I remember why I havent been in 3 years. The fish is really low quality and nothing tastes fresh. While other sushi places in Davis are not stellar, Id go to Nobus buffet or Moshi Moshi any day over Fujis. One plus is that the staff at the bar was very nice and took orders quickly and checked up on my table. Regardless of that factor, I cannot eat here again.  Users/MissBelomy

20070528 10:29:26 nbsp Look everyone, sushi is not cheap.  Everytime I go to eat sushi either lunch or dinner I pay like from 4550 dollars for two people.  To have so much sushi for only 10 dollars a pop is so much better.  Quit complaining.  Im gonna be sad when i graduate and move away from davis and not have fuji buffet anymore. Users/PorkFoo

20070711 17:12:08 nbsp I think their sushi is delicious and for 11.95 all you can eat, I dont know what else u could ask for. If you go before they open its usually a pretty long line but I usually go at about 1:00 where the 2nd wave of sushi goers have finished and there isnt any wait. Users/JoeLow

20070805 12:14:43 nbsp Ive gone here dozens of times for the sushi buffet and I have never been disappointed. It is true that the line is insane, and it is no ones cup of tea to go stand out there at 10 and wait an hour and a half to eat first, but Ive always been satisfied. The chefs are super quick and responsive to your orders and water is always kept filled. The rolls are delicious and beautiful looking. Although the sashimi is not the finest quality, it is plentiful and enjoyable. I recommend the Spider Roll and the Davis Roll. The shrimp tempura is also delicious and amazing. There is a roll they make with tuna, mayo, spicy sauce, and green onions that I do not know the name off, but it is also wonderful. There is a reason why the line stretches the entire block, because Fuji Chef is the Davis restaurant to eat at. Users/CoreyPham

20070918 22:52:53 nbsp O_o my god I went to Fuji for the first time and nearly died from eating so much.
if you are bothered by the food being old then ask for something to be made up for you. Or wait until they put it out and get it then.
...I wasnt sure HOW to tip tho...i wanted to tip to the lady that was getting my special orders...but she was handling food...would it have been ok to give her cash??... Users/ArianeMetz

20070920 22:39:39 nbsp The workers can be very rude. I will not eat there again. Users/customer

20071009 16:47:13 nbsp I went to Fujis buffet for the first time over the past week and it was incredible.  The sushi wasnt better than the sushi you can get elsewhere (eg. Moshi Moshi, or Sushi Nobu for buffet), but it was good, the variety was simply incredible.  The line was ridiculously long  we got there at 11 and we didnt get in to eat until 12:15 or 12:30.  But I now understand why this place is so popular.  I cant wait to go back and try more new stuff. Users/AlexPomeranz

20071010 21:20:56 nbsp Well, if you are an Asian and I mean those grew up in Asia, you are definitely not gonna appreciate it.. its just Another Americanized Sushi House... Yea, its cheap, but doesnt worth to line up and wait for it...I would rather drive 45mins1hr to some Sushi restaurants out of Davis Users/JanetAu

20071011 18:33:42 nbsp Janet, judging by your name, youre probably Chinese. Unless youve eaten a substantial amount of sushi in Japan, any kind of Sushi you ate in China or whatever is not authentic sushi, either. Users/BlackHamster

20071026 18:19:05 nbsp I went to Fujis for the first time about a month ago. It was pretty tasty for being a little over $10; the only exceptions were the sashimi and nigiri, which were still half frozen. I felt optimistic though, and passed it off with an I guess its good to know the fish hasnt been sitting out for that long? Sort of? In any event, I spent that night puking. : Despite negative reviews, for cheapo buffet sushi I actually prefer Jusco over Fuji Chef. Users/ScarlettYing

20071103 20:27:17 nbsp Ate here for the first time this morning. My friends and I signed in on about 11:15, and were not able to actually get seated until 1:55...minutes before the buffet price ended. The wait is INSANE, and the sushi was not exactly worth it to be honest although it wasnt bad. For a 2+ hour wait, I expected it to be treated to some damn magical sushi, but it was just okay. Id come here again, I guess, but not if I find something better. Users/kthrnngo

20071204 15:35:46 nbsp The Sushi here isnt exactly the BEST in the world but for the price its pretty good. Once you get a hang on how long the waits are its not really a problem, just go somewhere else while you wait and chill with some friends. Users/NCSaephanh

20080210 16:42:04 nbsp went to fujis yesterday. had a good experience and i think we will come back here again.
their dragon and especially their y2k rolls were awesome. we had their udon soup and that was delicious too, a bit too salty though.
the service was great.
its a bit pricey, but then so is everything else in davis.
might as well pay a bit more for good sushi. Users/jentruong

20080223 00:15:31 nbsp That added comment in the description that Fuji doesnt serve red snapper is kind of minor. Should we be upset that we are being fooled? Maybe. But I dont know many people who wake up and go Today I am going to a sushi buffet (doesnt matter which restaurant) and I want to eat red snapper! I order it sometimes, and maybe the reason why it is so flavorless is because it wasnt red snapper all along. That doesnt detract Fuji from being a great place to get all you can eat buffet. They have many other great things to eat there, well worth what you pay. Fuji also recently won Best Sushi in Davis for the second consecutive year I think. So go check it out, and try their tilapia! Users/CoreyPham

20080316 19:03:08 nbsp They now serve dinner buffet which is great because it means less crowds. The sushi is good but it can get tiredsome sometimes. The eel sauce they put on a lot of their dragon rolls becomes very tiring, overpowering, and strong. Also, I wish they have more different kinds of rolls! Overall, its good place to eat sushi once in a while and moneys worth. Users/AlexN

20080324 13:36:16 nbsp given my moniker, i should not admit that ive been to fujis buffet at least 4 times, twice for lunch and twice for dinner.  they serve pretty much the same food at both, with dinner also offering crab legs (not bad, but a grade below top quality), fried salmon (regrettably dry), and clam salad (not very well executed). The sake and maguro sashimi are usually pretty decent, not #1 grade but still eatable as sashimi. However, sometimes the maguro is just old tuna.  In any event, it is usually better than the tuna served at Nobu Hiro  which seems to use the pinkish frozen tuna from vietnam available at $5.99 at groceries. However, Fujis Hamachi (or yellowtail) is absolutely gross.  Consistently badthey may have bought a bad batch a while ago and are still trying to pawn it off.  Shelled oysters are a treat but come seasoned only with a lemon wedge.  They will also fry you up some soft shelled crabs and salmon skins.  They offered hamachi collars at the dinner buffet, but looking at the hamachi, i shuddered and passed.  The rolls, like a lot of rolls made in northern California come ladened with a sort of teriyaki/unagi sauce that gets very, very tiresome.  By themselves, the rolls too become tiresome.  The shrimp tempura by itself was bland and too doughy. Not too greasy though.  The sushi is, for the most part, better here than at Nobu Hiro in my opinon.  At nobu, they give you about a 1/2 slice of fish atop a mountain of rice, with the sushi warden watching to ensure that the rice is eaten.  At Fuji, average amount of rice and a large slice of fish.  I would go back, because the price is not beatable if I like raw oysters, soft shell crab, and lots of sake and maguro sashimi.  Service was very spotty; very friendly one day and not so friendly another.  For food quality, I would have to say C+/B.  For value, i would have to say an A. Users/1pickyeater

20080402 20:19:32 nbsp The salmon sushi ranges from not so fresh to quite fresh (and chilly  apparently recently out of a freezer).  The salmon is not particularly flavorful.  The unagi seems reasonably fresh, but again rather bland.  This place is definitely much better for quantity rather than quality.   Users/IDoNotExist

20080408 14:49:46 nbsp Does anyone know anything about the recent change in management/ownership? Users/CoreyPham

20080414 16:57:54 nbsp We just went to Fujis last night for the dinner buffet. It was just like the lunch buffet but without the long line. They even had grilled salmon which Ive never seen at the lunch buffet. As for the change in ownership, they said that the new owners (a Taiwanese family/firm) will be taking over next month. Most of the crew will stay on for a couple of months to transition, but most likely will not stay to work for the new owners. Im sad to see them go (the family, not the business), as Ive been going to them as long as Ive lived in Davis (97). Hopefully the new owners can make Fujis better rather than worse.  Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080417 00:10:00 nbsp Theres a billion reviews already written for this so Ill be brief.  Nigiri is of lower quality than Nobu, but still much better than Jusco.  I dont like the rolls, because they add too much sauce, cut them too thick, and their temperature makes them not feel very fresh.  The selection is easily the largest out of the three buffets.  One big plus it has over Nobu is that you can order sashimi  you can potentially walk out of the restaurant without eating a single grain of rice!  Some people dont like that the sashimi is sometimes still a little frozen  a problem, yes, but at least you know it hasnt been sitting out for a while.

EDIT: I wrote that the nigiri is higher quality than Nobu, when I meant lower. Users/BrandonWong

20080417 00:33:37 nbsp a lot people told me the fujis buffet has very good food, peoples waiting for hours to have lunch, so i went there give a try ,they had more different food to choose, even sashimi you ask for, but fish are sucks , the sushi nobu has the best fish in town and better price. it is waste money for this kind sushi. the ownership of fujis will be changed pretty soon, the new owner(from Chinese restaurant) never had experience how to make sushi, still need old employee for training new guys, do you trust this place can make better sushi, i dont think so. Users/bob25

20080420 18:51:19 nbsp Definitely not all its cracked up to be. The quality was pretty good, but they didnt have much variety and the overall means of getting food is awkward. I prefer juscos (across the street) mainly because you get to order and they serve so its more organized (but the quality is not as good). Having to crowd over people or stand at a corner while waiting is quite tiresome, and makes the food much less enjoyable. Its harder to talk to a group of friends when every five minutes someone has to get up to get more food. Then again their food is pretty good...but definitely not worth more than a ten minute wait. Users/ASQWIK

20080502 16:30:10 nbsp I have been here three times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner, and all three times I have been blown away by the sushi. Im a bit spoiled by the sushi I get at home, but this is the best sushi for your money here in Davis. Users/CGall

20080514 23:08:25 nbsp its scary that so many people are willing to risk food poisoning or an upset stomach for a cheap buffet..its quality is no better than any other type of buffet...they will even gove u a plate of sashimi still frozen when its busy...pretty gross.  better off trying nobus buffet, much better quality, and better cuts of fish Users/foodexpert

20080602 23:22:49 nbsp I wrote a review not too long ago, but I must note now that Fujis has been on a decline for the past few months.  The nigiri has way too much rice added, and the fish arent cut very well.  You can particularly tell the poor cutting if you order the sashimi during lunch hours. Users/BrandonWong

20080607 16:17:57 nbsp Its alright. Way overpriced for dinner and the wait for lunch is ridiculous and not worth it. Decent sushi though. Users/Kicker

20080621 17:52:27 nbsp For $17 I think their dinner sushi all you can eat buffett is totally worth it. We dont normally get anything from the boats but rather order off the menu. Its good sushi that you can stuff yourself with but if you are looking for a highend experience I wouldnt reccomend here. Users/Zeeba

20080806 22:11:55 nbsp Soooo good. they even have several choices for vegetarians. its great! my personal fav: veggie tempura drangon roll ) Users/PalakKapasi

20080905 12:31:41 nbsp I used to come here once a week for a bowl of miso soup, a side of age gyoza, an order of hamachi kama, and then 2 random items.  Best stuff ever...those were the days... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081028 15:52:12 nbsp I havent tried all the sushi joints in Davis yet but this is not the best. Ive been here approximately four or five times and I have to say the quality of the sushi/sashimi is low but you cant expect much quality from buffets. If you like ungodly sushi creations topped with mounds of sickly sweet sauces then this place is for you. If you like your sashimi semifrozen or worse, warm and doughy, then this place is for you. Everything else is pretty much standard decent tasting food. Not worth the price unless youre furiously hungry for quasiJapanese food. Users/AnonymousStudent

20081117 19:48:44 nbsp They DEFINITELY have upgraded to the better! Its wonderful here now, the rolls are nicely made and more variety on the sushi boats. Nothing is sitting around, its delicious :D  Users/MissAmyQ

20081204 15:34:28 nbsp AMAZING!! I love FUJI! This place is great. I love how you can grab anything off the boat and also order off the menu. They have the best Miso soup as well. I am a big fan of the spider roll and the y2k roll. The gyoza are great and the short ribs are even better. It just sucks my stomach cant handle eating there everyday, cause the price is super affordable and the food is really good. Users/hazeleyes16

20081207 02:55:18 nbsp Fujis was the original sushi buffet in Davis...Then Davis Sushi tried to steal the show. For a while, Fujis was going downhill but Im glad to say that I think its back on top of the sushi world in Davis. When Davis Sushi Buffet arrived, it was clearly better than Fujis. Exactly the same, just done better. Cleaner, variety etc. However, I think Fujis got the message, and one upped them yet again. They now have a a little more variety with the help of some new items on the menu and have cleaned the place up a bit. Prices are now 12.95 no matter what day of the week you eat for lunch.

After 3.5 years of eating Fujis, I was sad to see it go down and get passed up by Davis Sushi Buffet....But after maybe 1/2 a year of being a fan of Davis Sushi Buffet, Im back on track with Fujis...too bad I wont be there anymore. (

Its gotten better and its THE original. The former owner retired and the new owner seemed really nice and chatted it up a bit before lunch. Why support the idea of Davis Sushi Buffet when it was only a replica of Fujis and simply stole their ideas?   Thats just my opinion. I almost miss the good old days where you had to line up all the way past Ground Zero for Fujis an hour before it opened. It was a little ridiculous but that was all part of the deal.

Stick to the original and dont support the biters.

20090214 11:30:17 nbsp So I have been going to Fujis for years and years!! I grew up around Davis, and my family would make the trip to go. I was even part of the crowd that got there at the crack of dawn and brought my lawn chair. :)

Now that it is open all of the time with a buffet, my hubby and I go oncetwice a week. The staff are awesome!! They know us well! Whenever I sit down, they automatically give me two plates of my squid salad :) and two cucumber/tuna hand rolls.

I will continue to go there as long as they are open. My loyalties are to Fujis and I will not attend any of those copycats! mmmm maybe I will go tonite, all of this writing about Fujis is making me hungry!!!

20090315 11:03:29 nbsp This is a great place for people who eat a lot. Comparably, the sushi itself is lower quality for you purists out there, but Im not one of those. Its still tasty and fresh enough for a starving student like me.
Dont like the lines? Pay up the extra $4 and come later on. It wont hurt that bad, I promise.
I come in with a $20, sit at the bar, and eat like the pig I am. There are some really good rolls, some that are just okay, and some that I honestly dont like (Im not much for the spicy sauce, for example. It sorta lacks flavor to match the heat.). If youre new or a quick/massive eater, head for the bar. Newbies should come with friends. Pull one plate at a time and split it up, find out what you like. Keep an eye on the chefs, too. If one asks you if you want something, tell them what you like! Theyll put out more of it or make you a plate. Im a fan of tamago rolls for no reason in particular, and my best friend is addicted to the cream cheese wontons. They make great supplements to all that sushi.

To kinda sum it up, if youre looking for posh, highquality eats? Try elsewhere. But if you want something affordable, filling, and still tasty, this is great.

Another big plus? No waiting for service. I usually come around 8pm and there are no lines, even for the bar, and you get to just sit down and EAT. Users/KBathory

20090315 13:52:49 nbsp I should preface this by saying i saw the owner at costco buying 20 gallons of mayo, and a big box of foodservice brand toilet paper. Do sockpuppets eat at Fuji Chef? Image(sockpuppetfood.jpg, thumbnail, 100, right, sock puppet food) Users/BlueDot

   Answer:  No, Idiot.  Sockpuppets dont eat food.  Go back to Kindergarten.

 Out of idle curiosity, what makes you think there is sockpuppetry on this page? What Ive read here is pretty much consistent with the my opinions of the place and my friends. wl
  The five reviews from accounts with about 5 posts, all love this place. begs the question whether photo caption applies.
      You can always click on the account name, and look at user info to see where else theyve commented and how often. The only close link I can see is one from http://daviswiki.org/Users/hazeleyes16?actionuserinfo Hazeleyes and one from http://daviswiki.org/Users/sushi?actionuserinfo sushi (out of a few) suggesting they perhaps share some connection.  But of Sushis three comments, the first one about the other sushi place is negative, and the second says its better than Fujis. So I guess we can take it with a grain of salt.
 think this answers the question what do sockpuppets eat?
 sockpuppets have no teeth>>>sockpuppets dont eat OR sockpuppets eat soft foods
 IMO sockpuppets positively review and thus eat here, so sockpuppets do eat and IME this place goes through an excessive amount of mayo implying that
 mayo is at least palatable if not preferred sockpuppet food. also, the only other socially acceptable reason for rolling with 50 lbs of mayo is some sort of
 mayo wrestling event, because i have no personal experience at fujis i have to assume the mayo is food related, the last time i was there it was a kinkos.

20090624 20:37:45 nbsp After going back tonight, I was highly disappointed by the sushi dinner. I felt like the sushi rolls had been sitting out for quite some time and everything that was fried seemed to had lost its crispness. I didnt like the taste of their sashimi, it tasted kind of slimy. / I remember when I came here in high school in 2004, and had better food preparation.  Users/MissAmyQ

20090815 22:27:40 nbsp I ate there only once, and there is good reason for this. If you like the atmosphere of a subbasement industrial break room, this is the place for you. Harsh lighting, no windows to speak of, and mediocre food. Users/Darren22

They kicked me out for not ordering anything (I didnt sample off of anyones plate, I just talked with them). Now that I have money I will never eat here.
Unless they were planning on seating some stranger at the table there was no reason for them to be rude and as far as Im concerned I hope their sushi boats sink. Users/GreatRyan

20100120 09:59:03 nbsp This is one of the great restaurants in Davis and always delicious.  Yes, for sushi purists, you can probably do better elsewhere and also pay 24x as much, but value for the dollar is excellent here.

20100126 21:24:37 nbsp I used to eat here every monday one particular semester for lunch.  The more I ate here the less I liked their food!  Yet somehow crappy sushi was SOOO much more appealing than the class I had scheduled at 11 it almost didnt matter.  Heres my breakdown of the quality:

Top Notch Japanese Restaurant in NYC: 4 pieces sashimi, 8.99 > best Ive ever had, grade A+ cuts of fish & fresh
Hole in the Wall place in San Diego: large sampler platter, $20 > incredibly good, grade A cut, very fresh
Mikunis / any other authentic place not close to the water > pricey, but very good, grade A cut, but not so fresh
Store bought sushi (nugget)  $68 for 9 pieces or so > grade B cut, fresh
Fuji > 12.99 for unlimited > grade C cut AND not fresh.

PS Ive heard all non grade A sushi fish is treated with carbon monoxide & frozen so that it wont in fact, give you food poisoning.

20100129 22:53:23 nbsp Though the interior is a little run down they seem to have some of the better sushi in Davis.

20100816 15:09:56 nbsp I went here recently, and was rather disappointed. $12.95 is at the high end for a lunchtime sushi buffet, and being shoehorned into the bar was not ideal. We were not provided with a menu, and had to forage for one on our own. It wasnt worth the effort, however, since all the specialty rolls were variations on the crab/shrimp/cucumber/avocado/salmon theme, and even those with different ingredients tasted the same. In addition, when I requested inari (tofu skins on rice), I was informed that this is not available during lunch. This surprised me, since inari is relatively inexpensive. Beyond that we tried their crabcheese wontons, which I usually enjoy quite a bit (at other restaurants). Unfortunately, theirs were oddly sweet and tasted strongly of butter. All in all, this place was a large amount of small disappointments, which added up to my conclusion not to go back in the future. Users/JoePomidor

20110228 00:53:30 nbsp I LOVE FUJIs!!! If I want to spend money on sushi I splurge here, not only is their sushi delicious, especially when its made fresh, but their service is SUPERB! they actually WANT to serve you and will guys who make the sushi are more than happy to take any order you give them with a smile on their face. as opposed to Davis sushi where you have to pretty much flash someone to get your order taken lol, I feel so welcome here and I know the workers by name and they know me! they make it a point to have my favorite dishes waiting for me at my table before I even sit down at the sushi bar! now thats service! I love Fujis and they should keep doing what they are doing! :D Users/jennadedios

20110327 22:25:24 nbsp this was the first sushi place Ive been to in Davis. The nigari/sashimi here is just whatevers since I went to the buffet during lunch. Many people rave about the sushi here but I just dont see it. Something about boats of raw fish floating around for who knows how long on a bed of water just irks me. Eat here if youre on a budget and dont really have a taste for sushi because there are better options else where, mainly outside of Davis. If you want good sushi suggestions and are visiting the LA area, i can direct you to some good places. Users/C.Ling

20110401 15:09:48 nbsp Great, especially for the price.  I have never ordered something they couldnt make. This place competes in quality with nonbuffet sushi places.  Whenever I have relatives or friends from out of town I bring them here.  I hope this place sticks around for a long time. Users/SeanPatch

20110706 18:36:06 nbsp I love this place! I go to the Saturday lunch buffet. I definitely try to get there right when it opens cuz theres a line and like others have said, sometimes the food has been sitting out for a little while and I dont like my sushi warm. Have not gotten sick here and love that you can order things from the chefs in the middle. I just need to remember to ask for a menu so I know what I can order. Users/KathrynAzarvand

20110806 16:41:24 nbsp BEWARE: I went to eat with my friends at fuji today and found baby cockroaches roaming at the Bar! My friend and I caught two of the roaches and showed the waitress our discovery.  The waitress was like “Oh” and squished the bugs with her bare fingers and I don’t think she washed her hand afterward. She told us the pest control just came by last week, which is questionable since they were running around ALIVE right in front of us. The funny part was when she asked me what I wanted her to do about it…. as if I brought in the cockroaches for a free meal. I forgot to add that the sushi chefs do wash their hands frequently!

The bill came to 45 dollars and they decide to take a “discount” of 15 dollars off our final bill. I have been going here since I have started school at UC Davis and I am not going to be coming back to this place anytime soon. This is really saddening since this was my favorite sushi place to eat in Davis…

20110810 16:05:34 nbsp ate here for the first time a week ago. servers and chefs were very friendly and helpful! but the food was average and right at the end of my meal i saw a cockroach skuttling down the little wooden shelf net to the tables... definitely wont be coming back  Users/jaleh

20110816 16:36:19 nbsp The food is decent compared to the other sushi buffets in Davis. For the price that I am paying, I would expect better customer service (but I suppose working all day with fish and demanding customers can be tiring).

One of the few things I do not like about this restaurant are the flies. Maybe I just attract flies because Im ugly, but every time I go to Fujis, there are always these nasty little black flies. :(

20120409 15:04:35 nbsp Had lunch there yesterday. My friends mother wanted to go there and I decided to comply even though my husband and I havent gone there in over a year. We had stopped eating there because the quality of the fish was REALLY low and because the amount of small gnat/flies really creeped us out.
Anyways, I carefully selected a premade small shrimp tempura roll, philadelphia roll, seaweed salad, and ordered vegetable tempura. After I took the first bite of the philadelphia roll, I tasted something very hard and plasticy. I very politely used my napkin to spit out the hard contents, and found what looked like pieces of a plastic fork. (Like on of the spikes cut in half). Im not one to make a big deal out of something but I figured the waitress/owner should know that plastic is ending up inside their rolls. They apologized and comped my meal and the waitress let me know that the Chefs dont use plastic forks when making their rolls. (which wasnt reassuring).

Also; for the people who think you can order fresh rolls: my husband went to order a fresh shrimp tempura roll with green onion on top but the Chef seemed really annoyed and grabbed one off the top counter and sprinkled some green onion on it. I think if youre paying so much money for sushi you should be able to order a roll fresh.

We stopped going here last year and opted to budget out money for quality sushi, aka Mikuni. Users/jenb

20120816 15:04:31 nbsp Look people always come here saying its the best sushi in davis... This couldnt be further from the truth. I have been here too many times. The chefs give zero fucks and ordering from them is such a hassle but the worst part is the sashimi fish. It smeells like garbage from improper care in the freezer. Next time you go there smell your sashimi and youll know what I am talking about. Davis Sushi has friendlier staff and better quality fish
 Users/stefansavicic

20120829 12:51:39 nbsp THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE, The sushi that rotates on the boat is cold, well everything on the boats are cold. IF you do go, best advice is to always order from the chef. Their were fruit flies flying around all over the bar and in the sushi, I had to blow at them just to keep them away and they would come back. The Avocado you can tell has been old due to the brown color, and what finally called it quit for me was the tempura. It still had the sht inside them and was not taken out. I understand its a buffet but if your paying the same price as those top places like Mikunis and Sushi unlimited, you SHOULD JUST GO THERE INSTEAD. I will never eat here again. Only thing positive I cna say is that the chef was eager to serve and paid attention to us, but of course he did when there were maybe 5 other people in the whole building. Users/ShadiKanaan

20121030 09:44:09 nbsp We ate here in September, for the first time in about five years.  We came for a weekday buffet lunch, and I couldnt tell if it got worse, or if we just had good memories eating here with friends between 02 and 07.

Coming on a noncrowded weekday may have been a mistake, because I am positive there was a LOT less variety on the boats than what was usual (from weekends of years past, at least).  A lot of the sushi temperatures were off, which was a little off putting.  Temperature affects texture.  I did order one plate of sashami, which was a mistake  stick to the rolls here. We asked for unagi, and despite being told they had run out for the day, they put out dragon rolls topped with it about fifteen minutes later.  I cant tell if they got worse, or I learned better, but after thinking about it for a few weeks I think its both cases.  Service wasnt too friendly either, it involved a lot of pointing and mumbling.

All in all, Im glad we went back just to revisit the place, since it brings back a lot of fond college memories.  If we didnt have those, we wouldnt be coming back for the food.  Users/EdWins

20121103 20:15:51 nbsp All the rolls have some disgusting white mayonnaise stuff. Everything has crab salad in it. Like fake crab with mayonnaise. You try to order something fresh and they pretend like they dont understand what you are saying. No variety, low quality fish, terrible service. I will never go here again. Not even if you paid me to go. I felt sick the rest of the day after eating here.  Users/TJLanoue

20121108 16:24:37 nbsp If you want your sushi relatively fresh, come right at opening.  If you want dry sushi that has been sitting around for hours, come near closing!  In all honesty, their rolls are just smothered in heavy, flavorless sauces.  What I do love Fujis for is their Sashimi.  Ask for a large plate of sashimi, and they give you a LARGE plate of LARGE cuts of fresh fish.  Not quite as fresh and high quality as Nobus puny cuts of sashimi, but who cares when you have a platter of the stuff?  Awesome.
Absolutely worst rolls in Davis... But fantastic portion size for salmon sashimi. Users/SeanOtt

20121120 13:05:41 nbsp This is pretty much our goto sushi buffet restaurant in Davis. The sushi and the service are both good.

But for the quantity and price, you cant beat this place. Users/BrianPakpour

20131211 13:19:42 nbsp I would like to start this review by saying, I LOVE SUSHI! I lived in Modesto for two years and I tried every sushi place there multiple times. I am from Woodland and recently moved back, and was excited to try all of the sushi places in Davis since Ive heard such great things about Davis Sushi. Well, this was the first place I tried, and sad to say, I was very disappointed. Firstly, on a good note, it is all you can eat, so you can walk away full. Now that we have all the good out of the way, everything else...You could order rolls, and theyd come out within seconds. They were cold and premade, and almost every roll tasted identical but with a different mystery sauce on it. The sake nigiri (one of my favorite things) was decent, although it was starting to get a little slimy. The rice also had too much vinegar. I was really disappointed, considering I read such good reviews about this place. After leaving, I developed a strange red rash on my arm that lasted a few hours and itched like hell! I didnt try any new fish that I hadnt eaten before so I dont know what could have caused it (unless one of the fish I ate wasnt what I thought it was...) That being said, I look forward to trying the rest of Davis Sushi out, but I doubt ill be giving this place a second chance. Users/SamuelMonteon

20140602 17:34:34 nbsp We went there today and there was not much standard fish in the sushi.   We had a few plates of fish roe and shrimp and one spicy maki roll. Other than that we had mostly chicken and vegetarian plates.   The fancy rolls were more confusing than exciting.  This wasnt really sushi, it was sushi.  They said that you could special order the nigiri, but there was only one server popping in and out from the kitchen and she looked pretty busy.  This restaurant is hardly any fun compared to what it was 10 years ago.  The only positive is that there is no longer any wait to get in. Users/GregKuperberg
