Full Belly Farm is about an hours drive northwest from Davis in the town of Guinda, CA.  The farms farm has been using organic practices since 1985 and is certified by California Certified Organic Farmers.  They grow and market over 80 different vegetable, fruit, nut, and herb crops.  They also have a flock of chickens, a herd of sheep, some pigs, and several cows. They sell luxurious organic wool yarn from their sheep.

Their pomegranates are to die for, making pomegranate lovers out of people who formerly did not care for them.

For Davisites, two things about Full Belly are particularly of note:

  The Hoes Down, an annual fall harvest festival
  Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), with deliveries to two locations in Davis.  Sign up on the website, where you can see the deliveries for the current week and read the weekly newsletter, The Full Belly Beet.
