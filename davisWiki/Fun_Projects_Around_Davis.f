20080809 06:48:57 nbsp The Bike Church is an ongoing fun project.  In summer 2008, the church is in need of people to join the project, so to speak, and you can go there to help fix the place up.  The more help they get, the less likely that the UC Davis University will shut them down.  Thats a very noble use of your time.  And fun. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20140722 10:49:16 nbsp Need help building a house?  Were a young couple looking to volunteer on a few projects over the next five years, so we can learn a thing or two before we try our own building project.  Were especially interested in earthbag or strawbale projects, but wed be happy to help with framing, drywalling, electrical, foundationlaying (or whatever the right word for that is  can you tell we know nothing?), anything and everything involved.  If youre building a house around the Davis area and could use some competent quicklearners to help with gruntwork, email us!  mrowlan1@gmail.com
