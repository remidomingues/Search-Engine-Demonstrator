This is the last of the Wiki Community/Future set of pages to be made.

Since we didnt want to jump the gun, on the Knight Foundation grant, I delayed making this page. Heres an overview of the Wiki Spot corporate budget as it stands:
The $350,000 is mostly dedicated to staffing Wiki Spot and software development.  Software engineers are not cheap, and this is only 23 people for 2 years.
While we applied for money for a community organizer, we werent able to obtain it, as Knight also wanted to fund http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/06/announcingthe2010knightnewschallengewinnersvisualsarehotandthecheckbookisbackout/ some other very worthy projects.  A lot of our goals for the Local Wiki project involve getting 13 other pilot communities as organized as Davis is, so fundraising to help hire a community organizer is a major goal of the board.

On the other hand, we need to maintain the communities that we have.  Its hard to say what kinds of needs we have for Davis, but there are definitely outreach efforts that we should be making, and those things can cost money.  Fortunately, fundraising activity can also serve as outreach in and of itself.

Anyway, this page is all about money:
  What should we spend money on in Davis?
  How should we raise money?


The idea that weve had floating around is to have another wiki benefit concert, like the Davis Wiki Wacky Woo 1.  However, I am neither in Davis nor cool, so I couldnt organize it.  Anyone interested?

Also dont forget about the donate button at the bottom of the page.   Users/BrentLaabs

1. People donate lots of money on http://pledgie.com/. 2. People donate money when there is a public document that gives specifics of pledge recipients qualifications, what they will do with the money, and an acceptable vow of regular candid reporting on these doings  example at http://rubymendicant.wikidot.com/proposal.

20100616 16:09:05 nbsp Several of the bars in Davis will do fundraiser nights, where X percent of what they make goes to the organization.  Why not try and do one of those?  Some downtown flyering could include join us at X on the night of soandso.  Outreach and fundraising at the same time. Users/TomGarberson

20100616 16:09:24 nbsp Oh, maybe people can donate through http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/455852114/localwikibringcollaborativelocalmediatoevery Kickstarter instead of Paypal.  Not sure what the diff is though, can anyone clarify? Users/BrentLaabs

   Folks should give through kickstarter until the deadline (sept 13).  I will post more info on wiki here in morning or late night crazy busy here in boston! Users/PhilipNeustrom
