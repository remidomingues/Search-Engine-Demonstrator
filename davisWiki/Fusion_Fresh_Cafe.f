The Fusion Fresh Cafe is the official name of the Food Trucks food truck that is outside the Mondavi Center. Though the UC Davis news service originally reported that the truck was going to be run by Sodexo, the guys at Shahs Halal Food confirm that the same owners own both food trucks (though the food is different). Reportedly the lunch dishes (such as the chicken kabobs) are similarly tasty.

They serve breakfast and lunch, and are open later on Mondavi show nights.


20131204 01:50:22 nbsp This food truck does have pretty much every item that Shahs has (http://daviswiki.org/Shah%27s_Halal_Food).  Its popular amongst the law student crowd due to its close proximity to King Hall and we can get good food w/o having to deal w/ undergrads (long lines) at the Silo or at Shahs.  The chicken over rice is fantastic and the employees are always super friendly. Users/RyanMeyerhoff
