Future Truck was a competition sponsored by Ford and Department of Energy that challenged students to take one of their SUVs (in 20032004 it was a Explorer) and convert it to a Hybrid Vehicles hybrid vehicle. UC Davis Team FATE participated in this competition by converting these vehicles to PlugIn Hybrid Vehicles. UC Davis Team FATE is under the direction of Andrew A Frank Dr. Andrew Frank in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering, who is considered the father of the modern PHEV.

UC Davis Team FATE is now participating in the competition Challenge X, sponsored by GM and Department of Energy. This competition challenges students to reengineer a Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV to reduce petroleum consumption, lower emissions and maintain vehicle utility. The main goal being sustainable alternatives. TeamFate continues to arrive at these competitions with PlugIn Hybrid Vehicles with advanced and highly efficient powertrain systems and controls. These vehicles not only meet the competition requirements, but consumer requirements, allowing for a 40 mile All Electric Range (AER) and consuming any mixture of ethanol and gasoline (flexfuel) for trips lasting longer than 40 miles. When combined with resources such as solar and wind energy, these plugin vehicles greatly reduce our dependency on oil (any oil), and will meet the needs of the majority of consumers.
