Fuzio is an Italianfusion Restaurants restaurant  Universal pasta. They have mostly Italian pastas, with a few Asian noodle bowls and steak/tuna/salmon entrees. (If youre looking for something closer to true Italian rather than fusion, then try Caffe Italia, Strings Italian Cafe Strings, Pasta, or Osteria Fasulo.) In May 2009, Fuzio reopened in a new 3,000 sq. ft. location on G Street after moving from its original location in the Davis Commons. The new restaurant is at the site of the former Cantina del Cabo. The patio is a bit smaller but the inside is much more spacious.

From their opening, there has never been much of a wait, and there are always plenty of servers and bussers. The place has recently grown in popularity, due to the promotions theyve been implementing to bring in more customers. Every Wednesday night in February from 49pm, all the pasta dishes are half price, making them an average of about $5. If you go before 7pm, its still happy hour, and the discount is unreal.


Fuzios happy hour is MondayFriday from 3pm7pm. All the appetizers are $3, draft beers are $3, and martinis are discounted as well. Its totally worth it to go with a few friends; you can get about 6 appetizers for under $20. Their appetizers are all pretty good; a few popular ones include the Calamari, Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Firecracker Lettuce Wraps, Crab Cakes, and Firecracker Slyders.  Two appetizers is easily a full meal if one of them is the pork slyders or the lettuce wraps.  They also have halfpriced bottles of featured wines on Thursdays.

Pastas are mostly under $10 and entrees are generally under $15, and the menu includes items like Shanghai Noodles with lemon grass and red curry, Blue Cheese Chicken Salad with Fuji apples, Mediterranean Grilled Salmon with spinach and Pesto Penne, Flatbread Pizza with Roasted Portobello Mushrooms, Pesto, Tomatoes, and Cheese, and Chicken Parmesan with Provolone. Other favorite dishes include the chicken curry noodles and the house specialty, the Firecracker Fusili. The portions are a bit small, but it could be a positive movement to help with the prevalence of obesity in America (or it could be just small).

The new restaurant has a full bar and wine list, and Fuzio has good martinis and margaritas, too. They have excellent lemonade (raspberry, strawberry, or mango).

There is an http://www.fuzio.com/ official Fuzio site with a menu and other items.

Fuzio is owned by Calmex, Inc., a Modestobased company that also owns a few Chevys restaurants as a franchisee. Previously the Fuzio restaurants were even listed in the phone book as Chevys rather than Fuzio. There are 12 other Fuzios in California, one in Missouri and one in Nevada. The first Fuzio opened in San Franciscos Castro district in 1996.

One of the Users/KevinWan owners of Sophias is an exFuzio manager and took several of the staff (especially bartenders) with him when he opened Sophias bar.

On Sunday, November 14th, 2010, after 11 years in town, Fuzio closed its doors for business.

In late summer 2011, popular Sacramento restaurant http://www.paesanos.biz/ Paesanos will open a location in this space. Its parent company also owns Uncle Vitos.


Overall, a pretty good, energized place to go if youre out with friends.  11 of my friends and I went there for dinner before Junior Prom.  It was rather disappointing that we had to wait for 30 minutes past our reservation time, but once we were seated, service was quite good and efficient.  Users/CynthiaHe

I went there with my boyfriend for lunch one day.  The service was pretty decent, but the food was highly dissapointing in quality and the prices were ridiculous.  I paid $8 for a calamari pasta dish that was the size of a bowl of ice cream at Baskin Robbins that was so saturated with lemon I could barely eat it, and my boyfriend got what he later called a dish of vinegar with a lettuce leaf on the side salad.  I wouldnt go here again unless someone else were paying and I was out of other options for food.  Users/MargieHalloran

This place is crap.  Very expensive compared to most restauraunts in Davis and the portions are tiny.  I am biased as I worked at The Macaroni Grill for two years and fuzios is our rival.  however our food is much better, our portions are huge, and you get to color on the tablecloth.  plus our foccacia is the shit.  poo on fuzios. Users/AllanRae

Okay I have to go there  you worked at the MACARONI GRILL, but Fuzio is supposed to be expensive??? And yeah  ur foccacia is the shit. Ima let you know I agree on that one LOL..   :)   joeistheish

20050813 11:03:26 nbsp I have been here twice.  Both times, the food was mediocre at best (but the mango lemonade was excellent).  The food is also overpriced.  I have no idea why this place is so popular when its both mediocre and expensive. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050823 17:50:12 nbsp I have not been to this Fuzio. I have been to the Fuzio in Dublin (west of Livermore). My father and I recently hit Fuzios/Dublin and had a great meal. I dont want to compare it to food from Italy, but instead say that the menu items we had were tasty and novel. And cheap! Each entree was less than $10. I liked it so much that next time we were on the 580 going by it, we called ahead for takeout. Users/TonyZuccarino

20050826 11:29:57 nbsp Their foccacia topped with parmesan and roma tomatoes is pretty yummy, and their salads are gigantic, as well as tasty. Users/AnnaJones

20051003 12:37:58 nbsp People always tell me that the portions arent large enough at Fuzio for the price but Ive never noticed. The staff is usually friendly and apologetic if anything goes wrong (only one bad server but great food regardless). I recommend the thai mussels/clams, firecracker fusili, barbwire gemelli, and the caramelized mushroom linguine. Perhaps the portions depend on what you get? Users/LiRic

20051013 17:32:46 nbsp Some of the food is okay.  As for its popularity, take a look at the waiters: it will explain the appeal for gay men and straight women. Users/MisterProfessor

20051107 15:28:29 nbsp On Saturday 11/5 we had a 20 minute wait. Our service was excellent. The waiter didnt hover and ask constantly how the food was. He came at well spaced intervals to refill drinks. The food was good too, I really liked the Chicken Marsala. Users/MyaBrn

20051207 20:35:04 nbsp Basically, overpriced.  Seafood dishes were good, the rest were just OK. Users/JohnNapier

20051221 04:23:41 nbsp It always surprises me when it seems I missed a comment on a restaurant Ive been to. I read about the bad things people said about Fuzio on the Wiki, but decided to try it out anyway because its kind of prettylooking inside. I was very, very disappointed. It seems as though the only thing good about this place is the way it looks. The service was probably the worst service I have ever, ever had. And the food! Usually when I go to Italian places I order a pasta dish, because I want to see just how cheap they are (cheap pasta places will bring out smaller dishes). Well, this was cheap, and it cost me a lot. I dont really plan on returning, ever. SS

20060205 03:31:34 nbsp After reading these comments I thought that these people were critizing fuzio like they were some expert on restaurants, after visiting this place for myself the other night, I thought that the food was excellent which I could see be made in front of me (I knew the ingrediants had to been fresh), and the service was just as good.  The atmosphere is like no other in Davis, and their bartenders make the best martinis.  Instead of reading all these ridiculous comments, you should give Fuzio a chance.  Ask the cute asian bartenders for a rasberry lemon drop, theyre the best! Users/KellySmith

20060205 19:02:28 nbsp From 46 on weeknights they have their happy hour in which all apps are $2 and fuziotinis are a $1 off.  Pretty cheap way to get filled up Users/JonAugst

20060310 18:35:28 nbsp amazing food. i have been there with my family several times and the dishes are delicious every time. i would recommend the chicken marsala and the calamari appetizer. i dont know why everyone is claiming they are expensive, the chicken marsala dish (which i can barely finish) is only 12 bucks. i guess it could be called expensive, compared to FAST FOOD. my boyfriend and i go there everytime we go out. Users/CorinneEpley

20061009 16:21:44 nbsp I like the setting. But the food was just alrite. The amount is too small considering how big the plate is and the expensive price. The seafood is good tho. Users/KiwiSelina

20070222 08:21:07 nbsp OK.  I actually think the food here is pretty good.  I ordered the firecracker pork pasta, which was excellent, although hardly spicey at all.  My brother ordered the marinara with meatballs.  The meatballs were great the marinara was better than the other italian places in davis (by default) but the pasta was certainly overcooked.  I think the portions are small for the price.  I think part of the problem is that this place has an identity crisis, the food and atmosphere kind of say nuevo but the crowd and service says this is just another davis restaurant.  Decent but i wont be popping in the door anytime in the very near future Users/MattHh

20070312 14:56:25 nbsp I went there twice. Both times, the services are really good. I like the food!!!!!!!!!! (Although I found the table a little bit too narrow) Users/CarlieYang

20070327 09:16:13 nbsp They dont have any beer on tap! My steak was fine, after I sent it back to get it cooked the way I had ordered it. Users/JoFeuerstein

20070502 12:44:21 nbsp the taste of the food was not correctly seasoned and portions are quite small for the ridiculous price.  Users/trambajuice

20070502 20:30:24 nbsp This will sound like an odd comment, but they make a great tuna melt. A great tuna melt is hard to find. Most are soggy or greasy or use dark tuna or put pickles in the tuna. Users/CovertProfessor

20070520 15:41:03 nbsp I just have to say this  Im a new student in Davis, and EIGHT DOLLARS FOR A PASTA DISH IS NOT EXPENSIVE. I used to work full time, and went to plenty of restaurants in that timeframe (4 years) before transferring to the University and 8.00 is actually pretty reasonable. That being said, I LOVE this place. The pork fusilli dish is UHMAZING if you like REAL spicy food. I especially have a close tie to this place because that have one in the heart of the Castro District in SF (the motherland). Users/joeistheish

20070520 15:55:38 nbsp OH! I will say that it did take an act of CONGRESS one time to get some extra sour cream. I think our sever was new, though  bless her heart. Users/joeistheish
   Just to note, would that be oral congress? or normative congress? and was the cream good? ~Davepoole

20070801 13:41:11 nbsp great food ,my favorite is happy hour with being able to order the 2 dollar appetizers. My friends and I always get several plates of food appetizers for under 10 bucks, the mussels are excellent, the romano tomatoe bread and above all the calamari. I have eaten here on several occasions and enjoy their fire cracker pork, and seafood medley pasta. UNIQUE FLAVORS! FRIENDLY staff ,but best of all cheap appetizers Mfri 36 i believe with a dish normally costing 8 dollars a plate who could go wrong with being able to try all the appetizers on the menu for under 10 bucks(very filling)  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20071012 20:09:26 nbsp I went here for a late weekday lunch, alone (with a book.) I felt comfortable dining alone here, and I dine alone often, so I value that. I sat inside because it was a little chilly and rain was threatening, but I love restaurants that have outside seating, and this outside seating area is nice enough, especially for peoplewatching. I had the pork fusilli. The pork (gingerbraised) was tender and delicious. The habanero pesto was quite spicy, but the sour cream cools it off and I LOVE sour cream. The pasta was perfectly cooked and an unusual type, which I appreciated. My waitress was friendly, attentive (but not overly so,) quick and happy to bring me some extra sour cream, and kept my water refilled. I thought that the portion was perfect. I suspect that most people are used to stuffing themselves and/or bringing home leftovers for less than $10, but as a recent San Francisco denizen, I do not have such expectations. I did not have an appetizer, just the pasta. I was starving and I left pleasantly full after eating the entire bowl of pasta. It was happy hour, so I enjoyed a $3 Hefeweizen, which I didnt think complimented the pasta, but that was my own mistake (I didnt ask my server for advice, which I usually do.) Id eaten at the Fuzio in downtown SF before, and remember not being impressed with the food, but I dont remember what I ordered. I had a couple of martinis there, though, and they were great. I would definitely return to this restaurant for the pork fusilli. In fact, I think Ill go do that now... Users/EvoDiva

20071019 18:13:24 nbsp The food was not bad:  Not great but not that bad either.  The lettuce wrap appetizer was the best part of the meal.  I went with my boyfriend on a week night and we sat outside, which was nice.  The service was very good. Users/LolaTorney

20071119 16:28:02 nbsp We went here over the summer for happy hour. We were seated and given menus but no water or silverware. We sat there for ten minutes, trying to make eye contact with the servers walking past us but no one stopped to give us water or talk to us. We left without anyone having stopped by our table. There were only a few tables there as well; we were the only table inside, and there were only three tables outside. Ridiculous.  Users/ElleWeber

20071218 16:43:18 nbsp No matter how you feel about their food, you HAVE to love their $0 corkage fee! Users/Red

20080215 17:52:37 nbsp Love Fuzio! The food is unique and tasty! The best part is that it isnt too expensive for the college student! Users/jglovicz

20080220 19:16:04 nbsp If you are a minority dont go here! they are racist!we decided to go to Fuzio to try. We didnt go at a high peak time so we didnt ahve to wait. however when we went the waiter set us at an area where no one was and then put down the menus and left. That was it! he didnt even come back to ask whether we wanted something to drink or not. There wasnt even water available to us. NONE! no one even asked. however when white people came in they were served immediately, set at the place with all the people and given drinks. We waited over 15 minutes and nothing happened. That waiter never even came back to ask us for anything we just left. two of the waitresses were shocked there was people even in that secluded area when we left. But even when we left no one said thank you come again or something. DONT GO HERE! THE SERVICE SUCKS! Users/JGG

20080224 12:56:57 nbsp I have to agree with the above post. I dont know if we qualify as minorities, but regardless, the service here was terrible. We ordered a couple of drinks, waited 15 minutes for those, then over an hour for our meal. No water was offered, bread, nothing. When our food finally arrived, I got something I didnt order.  To make things right, the manager offered to only charge us for the drinks, not the unrecognizable food that we didnt order.  We decided to take off and find a meal elsewhere. No complaints about the bartenders though, the drinks were good. I guess I cant actually comment on the food since we were never served any.  Users/joel

20080515 19:42:25 nbsp The patio during nice weather makes the variable service tolerable.  I go to Fuzio a lot during the warm months; its my favorite outdoor dining spot in Davis.  The Chinese elms provide a lovely filtered shade that makes even hot days pleasant.  My favorite dish  the one I order whenever Im there  is the Greek salad.

There was an ownership change recently, and while the change introduced some new items to the menu, it also brought an unwelcome change to the house bread:  a mediocre focaccia in place of a decent sourdough.  Still, for a relaxed place to dine on a warm day or evening, with friends, colleagues or just a good newspaper, Fuzios patio is hard to beat. Users/JimFrame

20080622 17:39:11 nbsp Ate at Fuzio today for the first time.  Higher prices have often lead me astray to Habit Burger or Plutos instead for a quicker, cheaper bite.  I would agree that the service was somewhat slow, but they were very attentive to refilling our waters on such a hot day.   The bread arrived with our meals.  I had the mediterranean salmon, substituting a house salad for the pasta and it was DELICIOUS!  Didnt mind waiting a little longer for the food since the outdoor seating was so nice.  I will definatley return. Users/MissL

20080622 19:34:48 nbsp The food is tasty.  Portions are a bit small.  Ok.  More than a bit small.  The bread pudding is seriously good.  Service ranges from slow to glacial, although much of the service delay appears to be related to cooking time.  (Dont go here if you are pressed for time.  Seriously.)  Prices are high for what you get.  Note that the kitchen appears to close well before the restaurant does. The patio is pleasant to dine on, so long as the weather is good.  Users/IDoNotExist

20080712 12:15:08 nbsp Two words: Firecracker rocks!!! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080802 22:14:07 nbsp Fuzio is really cutting back their hours. This is the second time, on different parts of the week, that Ive found them closed a good hour before listed... chairs upside down and everything. Users/ChristopherPrice

20080822 11:56:34 nbsp A few times when Ive been there, the staff was not sure when they were closing.  There was usually some debate over whether they were open or not.  On one occasion, they let me stay.  On the next (earlier in the evening), they said they were already closed. Users/IDoNotExist

20080823 12:13:29 nbsp I wish I knew how they make their firecracker dishes.  It seems like this place is closing down or something with their whole are we open? issues.  Itd be a shame if they go away before I could figure out how to make it myself (not to say that I wont still go here if they stick around). Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081025 18:07:21 nbsp Great Happy Hour specials.  The  food is tasty and the atmosphere is fun.  I dont tend to eat dinner here only because it is expensive (for what you get).  Nothing upsets me more than to throw down a lot of money only to walk out still hungry.  Its not that expensive, but it isnt a bargain, either.  Why pay more for less? Users/CurlyGirl26

20081028 10:19:53 nbsp Couldnt make it for Happy hour so we ended up there during normal dinner hours. I want to like Fuzio, I typically have a decent meal when I go there but something is always off during my experience.  Last night the front was almost completely empty and yet they sit us all the way in the back with 2 other couples.  We were much too close for how busy it was and the ambiance of the bathroom really isnt all that wonderful.  The World Series and Monday night football were on TV and yet they dont even bother to think about asking if you would like to view either of them.  We always have to ask for bread and at these prices it seems like it should be there automatically or at least offered.  Upon asking they always provide it and Im shocked they dont charge you for it.  Some items are well sized and others are simply way too small.  Fuzio has good flavors and a nice variety of choices but I just never leave feeling like it was a great value or wonderful experience.  Happy hour seems like the time the only smart time to visit this place. Users/loneshark

20081106 22:32:47 nbsp I love Fuzio; the portions are pretty small, but I like it  its just enough, so you have room for dessert. The tiramisu is AMAZING!! And HAPPY HOUR is the best  Monday thru Friday from 36, all the appetizers are $3, so you can get a bunch of em and stuff yourself for cheap! The servers are pretty hot too. :)  Users/mday24

20081106 22:33:57 nbsp For the record, theyre not closing; theyre moving to G Street, next to Froggys, supposedly on Jan. 1 theyll open in the new location. Users/mday24

20090130 01:07:52 nbsp This place is pretty good... I wasnt turned off by anything. The atmosphere was nice, the waitress was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. The portions were just right  I was able to finish my meal and feel satisfied, but not overly stuffed. I recommend their mango sangria... delicious! I had no clue that theyre moving until I read it on here... but if and when they do, Id eat there again for sure.  Users/MichellePalmer

20090202 13:54:49 nbsp If your dinner party cant decide on a cuisine, Fuzio has a few different types of food (Asianinspired, Italianinspired). However, this means that you cant really  count on getting original or authentic flair. I had the pad thai, and though it wasnt bad, any other thai place in town could have done a better job. The wait staff was a bit slow, and my party spent about 20 minutes waiting for a check. Its a clean place and not badly priced, but if you want authentic flavors, go elsewhere. If you want food that is designed to suit a generalized palette, then Fuzio is the place. Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090531 09:13:14 nbsp Im going to miss this place and the carrot ginger soup... Users/KBathory

20090601 15:01:38 nbsp Fuzio has reopened to a new location on G street. I cant say Im thrilled to see it back as I always had horrible dining and drinking experiences at its prior location.  Users/nkristis

20090710 22:00:43 nbsp I think its pretty good, but the portion size is kind of lacking for the price. I ordered calamari as an appetizer and for $10+, it was skimpy and I ordered some sort of Camboloza? Rigatoni and it turned out really plain for pasta with mushroom alfredo & chicken. I dont think Id come back.  Users/MissAmyQ

20090907 23:27:59 nbsp terrible food. almost as bad as cafe italia, but with pretense. Users/JustinMehlhaff

20100119 11:50:15 nbsp Fuzio had been a mediocre restaurant in my opinion, but recently they have been making a lot of changes to bring in more customers. Theyve got a new menu with some flatbread pizzas that are actually pretty good! HalfPriced pastas on Mon/Tues/Wed nights are super cheap, and actually really tasty. They have a huge variety of flavors; all my friends found something they liked. The service was good too  our waitress was really friendly and fun. We are definitely going back, especially during happy hour  all 7 of us had appetizers and a meal for about $40! I would totally recommend it to anyone. :)  Users/mday24

20100128 12:48:09 nbsp Ate here with a group of friends on two occasions and am still middle of the road about it.

Their prices are a bit high for the portions, while still being cheaper than many other similar establishments. Their drinks are pricy but flavorful.

I had steak on my two visits, while my friends ate Meatballs (which I was told were amazing), Salads (made large, vibrant and flavorful but you will need to practically beg for any kind of dressing if you want it) and Halibut (which was rubbery and not entirely tasty). As for my steaks, the first time it was well prepared and full of flavor while the second visit was much more bland and dry. The sides are another thing entirely, limp, dull and barely edible spinach; Crisp, minuscule fries...

I like the atmosphere, it has a certain appeal to it (warm lighting blended with auburn and bronze highlights and well structured seating arrangements) and also has two Large LCD screens for those interested in watching television or sports more than paying attention to their company.

The staff, once again a fiftyfifty for me. First visit the wait staff were timely, nonintrusive and polite while also being very knowledgeable of the menu items and ingredients. Second visit, had to ask for water to be served initially and then ask for refills, had to beg for dressing for the salad, and she wasnt entirely sure about the menu items. Perhaps a newer hire, not sure.

Overall I would rate it  2/5 stars but am willing to give it one more chance and see how things turn out. Users/WesOne

20100204 21:35:10 nbsp The MTW half price pasta were promotions for the month of January. I found that out the hard way. This month of February the promotion is 1/2 off pasta on Weds only. I was there on a Tuesday. So sad. Appetizers were really good for the happy hour price though. Users/KimN.

  I, too, found out the hard way. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100220 16:11:32 nbsp I came with a group of 10 (including 2 preschoolers). The staff treated us very nicely, brought the boys juice with small plastic lids, and were attentive. I had the spinach salad, which was the best spinach salad Ive ever had. It was very large (compared to some of the other dishes). Two recommendations I would make: this seems like the type of restaurant that could provide each table with a nice basket of bread or rolls. Another would be to put a chicken and fries dish on the kids menu. I did order that for my son, and they were quite willing, but the kids menu has just 4 items which are variations on the same theme. Users/NoelBruening

20100308 16:00:31 nbsp First time at new location.  I liked the larger tables and it isnt as noisy.  The service was perfect.  Attentative but not intrusive.  My son had the chicken sausage pasta and really liked it.  I had the asian tuna with the mango salsa. Cooked perfectly and very flavorful. My partner had the mediterranean salmon which was also well prepared. I will go back again.
 Users/LokiAbbi

20100314 11:44:06 nbsp New location, new settings, but HORRIBLE service. We were seated in the back, which was not a problem; but the problem was, the waitress attended to people around us AFTER we arrived. We were done with the menus, and were ready to order but the waitress did not even stop by our table to ask how we were doing. The only time she came was when ANOTHER waitress asked her if she had attended to us (I could see them pointed and looking at us from the other side); the waitress then DID NOT come to us; we had to ASK for service. HORRIBLE, I mean HORRIBLE service Ive ever received in Davis...and it was not even busy, there were only 5 other groups! Users/kkloveablebaby

   > Sometimes when it gets slower, the sections change, and the servers arent aware of their new tables. It happens occasionally in any restaurant. Im sure life will go on if you have to wait an extra 10 minutes to order your food. I understand your irritation (I get grumpy when Im hungry too) but, alas, patience is a virtue. ;)

20100526 17:46:52 nbsp We used to frequent the old location weekly, but once they changed the bread and I was diagnosed with Celiac, we stopped. Tried this new location a few times, and while the food is okay, the prices are pretty high now. The service is friendly, but really slow. We usually dont get our drinks we ordered before dinner until after were through eating. Weve cancelled a few of our drink orders due to this. Id say 3/5 stars; we love to sit outside and watch the trains pass by as we enjoy our meal. Users/JuanaBNDavis

20100613 12:14:26 nbsp Our server was great, but that was about it... Service was very slow even though the restaurant was pretty empty. We ordered the firecracker lettuce wraps, and for $7.50, I would expect A LOT more food. It was only enough for about 2 legit wraps. I ordered the pad thai, and it was too spicy to taste any of the flavors. My dad ordered the ahi tuna, which is supposed to be seared on the outside but rare inside. It was cooked fully through and almost as hard as beef jerky. They brought him another filet that was cooked right. My mom ordered the halibut without the garlic aioli, which was also very overcooked and drizzled in garlic aioli. Grandma said her chicken marsala was good. Wont be going back here.  Users/StephanieRobinson

20100624 13:13:17 nbsp I love the happy hour.  $12 will get you a beer and 3 any 3 appetizers, which is a nice, big dinner.  They also have $5 minipizzas during happy hour (IIRC theyre around $6.50 or $7.00 normally) which are apparently new.  And tasty.  I dont recall exactly what the beer options were, although the only IPAs IPA they had was Racer 5, which seems to be a local staple (see, e.g., Burgers and Brew, which rarely carries other IPAs on tap).  I think I got some garlic fries, the crab cakes, and some spicy chicken wraps, which were enough to easily fill me up.  The fries were pretty good, although nothing special.  The crab cakes and the wraps, though, were excellent.  Highly recommended. Users/TomGarberson

20100804 23:10:45 nbsp The main thing I remember about the old location is that it smelled like bleach. The new spot is comfortable (bad acoustics, lots of asking server to repeat) with good light and more than adequate taps: Racer 5 and Black Butte Porter among them. Happy hours a deal: $3 appetizers and $3 pints, and the spring rolls were fresh and flavorful, if a tad dry. The lingering question: how is it possible that their Firecracker Pork Fusilli gets so much love? Tastes like too much salt was added to the gingerflavored hamburger helper.   Users/Swilltopower

20100820 09:21:42 nbsp This is my new favorite happy hour.  The prices on the appetizers cant be beat, they also have a very nice outdoor patio to enjoy your food and beverages.  I personally like the lettuce wraps and pork sliders.  The portions on all of the appetizers (except for crab cakes and spring rolls) are quite generous.  Users/DagonJones
