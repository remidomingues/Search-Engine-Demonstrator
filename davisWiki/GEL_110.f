GEL 110 is the Summer Field course for UC Davis ../ Geology students.  This course is required for geology students pursuing a BS and is optional for those working towards a BA.

The following hints and tips about Summer Field was written by Adam Asquith, a UC Davis Geology alum (with permission to repost).   He wrote this because students have a ton of questions about the course, and they may not be easily answered.  Without further ado...

 For the classes 
  Youll be with the people there for 6 weeks, so try to get along.
  bring lots of sunblock and BUG SPRAY! there are TONS of mosquitoes there
  get a good widebrimmed hat (http://www.rei.com/media/gg/b63aab269a7c4e3ba3a731571cb56cf0.jpg like this)
  get some good ink pens and large tracing paper (11x17) 8.5x11 will work but poleta will be difficult (crosssection)
  a good eraser (not just the one on the back of a pencil)
  start the assignments AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!  this will save you time on the last day so you wont need to rush at the end.
  try to get feed back on your stuff whenever possible from the teacher heading up the section.  also, the TAs provide helpful advice, be nice to them (i.e. share your beverages, theyll appreciate it and so will you)
  Be warry of leaving any beverages in the research kitchen, they have a way of disappearing.

 For the river/fun 
  bring a good inner tube. the water is a little cold at first, but it feels good
  dont wear flip flops down the river, most likely youll lose one.  bring sandals if you have them, otherwise i would suggest investing in a cheaper pair of water shoes.
  Franzia tastes just as good as the bottled stuff and it wont spill as you go down the river
  Know where you are going to get out of the river before you get in, it will be a lot easier that way

 In General 
  be nice to the cook (our main cook was Lisa and she was great)
   ask for her scones for breakfast
   her chocolate chip cookies are really REALLY good too
   her berry cobbler is AMAZING
  there is another cook there sometimes (Shadow for us)
   his brownies are soooooo good
   he makes great eggs for breakfast

  If you really want to go to a bar type place, there is one in town, Rustys.  Its a little small, but good, pool tables in the back and nice bartenders in the front.  Just dont step on anyone of the local peoples toes (be friendly and they will be too).  Guys watch out for the bar fly.

  Explore the town, it has more to offer than you might think.

  Go to some of the lakes in the area and dont just stay at the camp... you will get bored.

...other than that, just have fun, drink some beer, and enjoy the scenery
