For the most part, we write about Davis on here, with a few exceptions where things outside of Davis have a particular relevance to Davisites. For example, we have a page for WalMart about the Woodland and Dixon Walmarts because Davis doesnt have a Walmart and its a place that plenty of Davisites want to go to. Considering that Davis has an Ace Hardware, do you think a page on the Dixon Ace is needed or relevant here? Personally, I think we should just add the information about the Dixon Ace to the existing Ace Hardware page.Users/WilliamLewis
