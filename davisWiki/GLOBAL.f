The Geographical Legacy Of the Benevolent Aggies League is better known as the GLOBAL: geography club.  A student organizations student organization at UC Davis that works to unify people with an interest in geography as an academic discipline.  GLOBAL hosts exploration trips, work to support members traveling to academic conferences and advocate for geography education both in the University of California and the community as a whole.

The modern club was formed in Fall 2007.  In the spring of 2007 the UCD Geography Club was established to assist students in the Geography Graduate Group with transportation to the http://aag.org Association of American Geographers conference that was held in San Francisco.  The club was reformed in the fall and renamed GLOBAL.  The goals were expanded and regular meetings established.


#Events Events

UC Davis 2nd Annual Geography Trivia Night tentatively scheduled for Friday March 16, 2011. Location TBD.

 Food & drink 
Were ordering some food and drinks to be ready right at 5:30, and itll be firstcome, firstserved. Once the free food runs out (and with our budget, that probably wont take long), folks will be on their own to order.

 Game rules 
The trivia game will start at 6 p.m. sharp. We will create teams onsite, so no need to organize a team beforehand. In the spirit of a multidisciplinary program, teams will have a mix of human and physical, student and faculty, tall and short, etc.

 Prizes! 
In addition to bragging rights for the next year, material prizes will be awarded to the winning team, and also to whoever submits the most popular question.

Regular meetings occur once a month during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters, usually in Hunt 158 time and day change every quarter.
