Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Noda.  Why are you removing my commentary from the wiki?  I wrote it to make the wiki much less commercial in tone, less businesslike and much more conversational and friendly.  Just curious, as it is rather insulting that youre calling what I wrote childish.  Its specifically aimed at decommercializing the wiki and making it more clear that the writeup isnt a business listing but rather an informal community description of the topic.
