Fish out of Water tackles the seven Bible verses used to condemn homosexuality and justify marriage discrimination. This feature documentary uses humor and original animation to make a traditionally complex and controversial topic accessible to those who dont like talking about religion and sexuality. Fish out of Water dives into the underbelly of America, crisscrosses red and blue states and talks to ministers from every denomination to uncover Americas impassioned relationship with homosexuality and the Bible. With slapstick animation and quirky interviews taken everywhere from barbershops to mega churches, Fish out of Water delivers a voice to the oppressed and informs to the misled. Most importantly, Fish out of Water sits down with hundreds of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender folks to impart their experiences with faith and sexuality. This unique lens spans across culture, race, religion, age, socioeconomic level and puts a relatable face on the themes of Fish out of Water. The result is a cultural crossstitching that serves as a piece of empowerment for the many Americans that still struggle to defend their identity within their own communities. By capturing the other side of the debate, Fish out of Water shatters deeprooted discrimination and challenges those who are spoonfed information without ever questioning or exploring the legitimacy of it.
