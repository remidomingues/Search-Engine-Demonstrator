20110711 11:45:28 nbsp Try it, youll like it and you will be back for more.  I know I will! Not your typical looking nail joint....so cute inside. Super friendly and enthusiastic staff who pay lots of attention to detail.  Tan did my pedicure....And oh, the foot /leg massage...nice long (20 minutes) massage with scrub, oil and hot rocks.  Users/DjMisschiff

20110711 11:46:43 nbsp Forgot to add....they are offering 20% on all services over $20...my pedicure was only $20. Users/DjMisschiff

20110720 18:34:58 nbsp Got a massage, the lady who did it seemed like she didnt even want to do it and she definitely doesnt have any sort of professional training. She kept going over the same spots, it was a pretty boring massage. Not completely terrible, but I now realize you get what you pay for when it comes to massages. Its just not their specialty. Also, though the massage room was way too small, the place seems very clean which is a plus.  Users/stevohfun

20110722 17:59:52 nbsp I just had a wonderful pedicure here, the best Ive had in Davis. Really comfy massage chairs, really good/long massage, great pedicure especially for the price. Definitely recommend.  Users/jlw

20110731 12:44:10 nbsp very calm atmosphere (No tvs, loud obnoxious music).  Hot stones and exfoliation scrubs are included in the basic manicure. Its very nice inside too. Users/JamieBeth

20110814 17:56:02 nbsp Just went in for the first time on a Sunday afternoon, 4:30 pm (they close at 5) and they were happy to do a pedi for me. Vi (sp?) did a nice, relaxing massage and French pedi for $24. The staff were very friendly and the interior is clean, new and nicely decorated. I will definitely be going back. Users/DrX

20110922 11:41:15 nbsp I got an excellent fill here for $16.  It is probably the best fill Ive gotten in Davis in a long time.  They met my minimum criteria: a) cant make you bleed at any point (has happened at at least 2 nail salons in davis for me, on my first and last visit to them); b) my nails cant crack/break/chip within the first threeseven days (happened at 2 additional nail salons for me in davis).  Ive been commuting to Natomas for 2 years to get my nails done, but I think the commute is over!  Also got an amazing pedicure from them a month ago.  Users/madanielelwicz

20120823 20:10:52 nbsp WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
I went here to get a gel manicure with my friend. I can LIST the number of things that went wrong:
1. We both made an appointment in advanced and both waited for 25 minutes before we were seated.
2. We both happened to pick colors that they didnt have in the store. Why would you have it on display???
3. I asked for a french manicure with a dark purple tip (instead of the regular white tips) and she refused to do it until her coworker explained to her it was the same process and shouldnt be a problem.
4. She messed up one of my nails about 3 times, and proceeded to be rude TO ME about it saying that MY nails were too short!
5. The lady doing my nails (as well as the lady doing my friends nails) completely had no idea how to do a gel manicure.
6. My friends gel manicure was absolutely ATROCIOUS. The actual gel nail polish shriveled up every time she would put her hand under the UV light. She ended up leaving with shriveled gel nail polish that she paid 30 DOLLARS for!
7. Last but certainty not least, the GEL MANICURE LASTED 7 DAYS!!!!! INSTEAD OF 3 WEEKS!!!!

I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! IT WAS HORRENDOUS!


AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS! Users/yanab

20121001 19:23:22  I got a pedicure here from the owner (Vi?) tonight and really thought it was topnotch, especially the massage. It was by far the best massage Ive ever gotten at a nail place, and was quite lengthy. In addition to a fine job on my nails, whatever scrubs they used made my skin delightfully soft was well. Agreed with other commenters that its a good atmosphere and a cute place. At a slow time (Monday night) I just walked in and didnt have to wait at all; it was just me and two other ladies. Recommended!   Users/PhoebeAyers
