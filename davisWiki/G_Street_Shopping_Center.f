This Shopping Centers shopping center is located on G St., between 6th St. and 7th St. It is home to the Davis Food Coop.

It is one of the oldest autocentric shopping malls in Davis, home to a Safeway Store at first, the northern strip developed later. G Street Shopping Center opened in 1967. If you look at the picture you will see indentations in the roofline every couple stores, this used to house stone walls with circles of varying shapes, these inevitably were used to climb on (you could get to the roof) so its no wonder they arent around now.
