Welcome to the Davis Wiki! I am very much appreciating the pictures you are posting of the Arboretum. Thanks very much! Users/DonShor
  Me too!!!  Thank you so much for the picture uploads and the edits.  If I might make a request, though  please make sure that you dont delete the links to the Arboretum, etc. They help to make the wiki more useful!   Users/CovertProfessor

Thank you! I was unaware that when I deleted content that I was deleting links. I shall add some soon, I appreciate the feedback!
  Actually, Users/BrentLaabs added a navigation table for all of the arboretum pages, saving you the trouble... see what you think.  I think its nice!   Users/CovertProfessor
