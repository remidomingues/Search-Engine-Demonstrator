Gadiel Rachelson has many nicknames.  Some are sensical: Gadi, Rach, Dude.  Some are not: Chave Gordon, Chods, G Spot, Le Marquis Go√ªx DHiers.  Please take the time to meet him.  He will make you realize that most things in life are worth smiling over.  And the rest are still not worth losing your precious sleepy time over.

The Man:

Works at the Education Abroad Center E.A.P. office near Cafe Roma (and thus is often found Cafe Roma there) Jams the funky bass guitar. Is athletically gifted. Knows how to get down.  Or so it has been said.
