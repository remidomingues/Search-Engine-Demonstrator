Galactic Overlord Taxi and Humanpet Taxidermy is a pancosmic corporation that is locally run by a wiki:wikipedia:Chimera (genetics) chimera clone of Adolph Hitler and the jackass who gets too drunk at every open event in town (,,...we know who you are...,,).  They can instantly be recognized by their signature black Hummers with limo tint and smog black smoke coming out of their exhausts.  Their vehicles bear a logo that extends into the 8th dimension and will destroy the sanity of any individual who looks at it longer than four and a half seconds. Note that inhaling the black smoke will cause your lungs to fill with tiny parasites, which should be photographed for the Spiders identify that spider wiki page.

Operating with a brood of XSacramentoX Users/BradBenedict Rio Linda based humanmeat consuming aliens, they not only taxi services help you get to your yoga class, also offer a nice side business of performing taxidermy of the various people they hit (whom they call bouncers due to the way they bounce off the hoods of their Hummers).  They are sometimes harvested by Bros for their thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which, when rendered down in beverage tubs, tastes just like PBR, only with a thick, verynotvirgin olive oil aftertaste.  Thats why Big 5 Sporting Goods Big 5 carries a large stock of whaling harpoons.


  Need to get somewhere in a hurry?  Davis has many taxi services for your transportation needs!

20110808 11:00:30 nbsp These assholes are illegal aliens.  I dont think they even have a business license.  And here the wiki commies are giving them their own page to advertise and take business away from hardworking, down to earth people who just tell it like it is.  Fuck these guys, and if you give them your money, fuck you too! Users/LoshJawson
