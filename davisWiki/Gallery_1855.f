August 2014 Show at Gallery 1855

Best of Seven
Seven serious photographers meet monthly to push one another to become the best they can be. Now they share the results! Come meet them, view their work, enjoy some refreshments and finish it off with a stroll on the sumptuous grounds.

Typically, artists gather for social occasions. Atypically, these local artists gather to look at each other’s work and offer feedback.  The Super Seven is a group of artists who live in Yolo County.  Through a variety of connections, we all know one another.   We have exhibited at the same galleries or have gone out photographing together.  In one way or another, we are familiar with each other’s work.  Several years ago, we started meeting formally every month in order to critique each other.  The rules were simple.  Unlike other critiques, here we had to be rigorous with each other.  There is a lot of trust involved in trade for a lot of vulnerability.  We all have the same goal, to refine our own personal vision.  This show represents the best of what we are currently doing.  All of the pictures in the current exhibit represent images that we have made in the last year.

The public is warmly invited to a free open house and reception for the Best of Seven on Sunday August 10th from 1 P.M. 4 P.M.
