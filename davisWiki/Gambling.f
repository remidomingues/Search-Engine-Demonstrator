Nevada
Despite the ads from local Indian Casinos about Nevada Style Gambling, you can just drive to Nevada and get real Nevada Gambling. Slots, cards, roulette, and craps are all available.  They are a bit further away, and in the winter, if it is raining here, it means it is Snow snowing in the mountains, so it can take longer to get to, if you can get there at all. All Nevada Casinos are 21 and up to gamble.
  Reno  The Biggest Little City in the World.  Easily accessible at 145 miles east on Interstate 80.
  Lake Tahoe  The most popular area is South Shore, since it is easily accessible via Highway 50.  Although it is more scenic than Reno and a little closer to Davis at 115 miles away, Highway 50 can be slower, so it generally takes the same amount of time.  If you want to go Old School, North Shore is a bit further away, but is host to the CalNeva Resort, Tahoe Biltmore Lodge and Casino the Biltmore, and some other smaller casinos.
   wiki:WikiPedia:Las_Vegas,_Nevada Las Vegas  (see adventures outside of Davis) The mother of them all, however it is 580 miles away, and approx. a 9 hour drive.  If you are saavy, you can get lucky sometimes and score cheap plane tickets.
     If you need to know more about Vegas, watch the Travel Channel for a while. It seems to be Vegas Week every week there.  Its like watching the History Channel for WWII crap, its always on.
