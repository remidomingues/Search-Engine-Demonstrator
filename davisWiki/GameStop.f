GameStop sells new and used Videogaming video games, as well as video gaming related items such as consoles and accessories.  Some GameStop locations also stock various items such as video game branded clothing, pins, etc.

You can also get a discount card, also known as an Edge Card, for 10% off used games by subscribing to Game Informer Magazine ($15 for 12 issues).  You can trade in games and game consoles for store credit (thats how they get their used stuff).  To trade in games to GameStop, you must be 18 and also possess valid California State issued ID.  If you present your Edge Card while trading in, you will also receive an additional 10% store credit on trading in games.  They also frequently offer bonuses to tradein value if you bring in more games; see the weekly ad linked above.

GameStop has begun to phase out their stock of used dvds.  Both Davis locations do not carry used dvds anymore, nor will they accept them as trade ins for store credit.  If you do find a GameStop that still stocks used dvds outside of Davis, there will most certainly be a discount when buying them.

The dont sell Mac games unless theyre selling a PC game that has builtin Apple Mac support.  The store devotes more space to console games than to PC games.

The store in the The Marketplace used to be an EB Games before they merged under the GameStop name. There are also stores nearby in wiki:woodland:GameStop Woodland, wiki:sacramento:GameStop Sacramento, Dixon and Vacaville.

The former University Mall store was previously occupied by a Cingular Wireless/Parrot Cellular store. Prior to that, the store used to be a Pacific Bell Wireless/Parrot Cellular store.  The University Mall store permanently closed on November 13, 2011.  Purchasers at that store before closing received a 20% off coupon good at other nearby GameStop locations.


20070908 13:52:02 nbsp The employees seem very friendly there, and will gladly talk with you about any game they are familiar with.  Users/AnnaF

20071117 13:32:56 nbsp they sometimes have BattleFrogs.
You should call and ask if they have a copy on stock. Users/RatBastard

20071201 22:40:17 nbsp I asked a guy at GameStop if the wii version of Guitar Hero 3 was any worse than the other versions and he seemed offended.  Then he didnt mention the Wii version is mono, despite it being labeled Dolby Pro Logic and people have a hard time getting online :(.  He might not have known, but that was exactly the kind of stuff I meant. Users/BradBenedict

20080109 17:19:05 nbsp Does anyone know if Gamestop has any games with Mudkipz in them? Users/Maitl

knock knock. whos there? one more store in davis that just lost my business. trex for life, smoke every day Users/ohanadildos

20080516 14:39:57 nbsp One of their employees, Adam S., was very helpful and professional. He seemed to really know his stuff about what the store sells.   Users/DaveCar

20080518 19:29:59 nbsp I find the Covell stores employees to be unhelpful and annoying. Whats up with that guy whos always saying righto? Users/BenH

20081013 20:30:51 nbsp REMEMBER: Be sure to call in beforehand to see if they have Battletoads for the Wii. Sometimes theyll say they dont, but dont let this faze you. Call again and again until they do. THIS IS OF THE UPMOST IMPORTANCE. Users/jaggers304

20081211 12:02:28 nbsp I keep checking periodically for battletoads for brick gameboys, they dont have it and for some reason seem to get offended when I ask... Users/StevenDaubert
OH SNAP I JUST HIT MY CLOSET AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND
  There was a site that told all its users to call their local gamestop and ask for BattleToads one day.  There were a lot of people that did that in the area, and still do it to annoy the employees.  Dont take it personally if youre actually looking for the game, Ive run into it too and had to ask what was up.

  The site would be 4Chan. If you do not mind graphic images, you can do some research on Encyclopedia Dramatica. P.S. I just broke the first rule. Users/hankim

20081212 00:15:46 nbsp Battletoads is the one with the barrel rolls, right? Users/AndrewHarrison
  Youre thinking of Starfox.

20090815 06:06:39 nbsp Oh My God!  The Battle Toads game they sell for the Wii is the best game i ever played! Users/DevinCastellucci
  The Wii version of that game is only on the Wii Marketplace, so they wouldnt carry it in store.

20100202 22:03:39 nbsp The best videogame store in Davis.
The employees are decent they arent the best
Old video games tend to have a Great price but a %50 that it will fail at some point in time when you play it
I saw a game that i wanted at. the game exists at both Target and Gamestop.
It was sold at target for 50$ and 40% at gamespot.

20100218 19:45:42 nbsp Ive been comparing Game Stop prices with amazon.com for awhile now. Even used games at Game Stop are more expensive than brand new amazon.com games that come with free shipping.

Theres a very clear winner here. Save your cash if you can wait a day or two for your game to come in the mail. Plus amazon.com doesnt have extremely annoying TV commercials or those horrible tradein your three 40+ dollar games for a 20 dollar credit on God of War 3 deals. Users/OrofinJackson

20100223 21:47:12 nbsp my psp scratched my new game. i took the game back and the guy was cool enough to give me a brand new copy of the game even though he knoew my psp had scratched it. great place to buy games. and a lot of the ps3 games have discounts. id recommend it Users/Hugz

20100401 01:33:59 nbsp 20100218 19:45:42   Ive been comparing Game Stop prices with amazon.com for awhile now. Even used games at Game Stop are more expensive than brand new amazon.com games that come with free shipping.


That says a lot, since amazon is anywhere from 2080% higher than ebay and half.com. I guess that is the convenience of getting your item immediately. Users/jdyeah

20100429 04:51:57 nbsp ebay/half.com is horrible for buying games. Game retailers have taken to buying used games for slightly below the cost theyll resell them, making it a useless endeavor to try to find good deals anymore. Ive watched too many auctions rise above gamestop prices (before shipping costs) to even visit ebay for games anymore.

Even if you do find a good deal, which isnt impossible, I hope you dont mind having no case, no instruction booklet, and a game that smells like cigarettes or maple syrup, because people seem to only ignore the sales that indicate bad condition. No seriously, thats what Killzone 2 smelled like when I bought it off ebay.

Ive bought Quantum of Solace ($9), Super Mario Galaxy 2 ($17 preorder), Battlefield Bad Company 2 ($35), Bioshock 2 ($31) on amazon ALL NEW cheaper than half.com has them for on any USED editions, AND THEY ALL CAME WITH FREE SHIPPING

If you really want good deals on games just let http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/ be your mecca. I got 7 new PS3 games from EA for $20 thanks to that site. Users/OrofinJackson
  I dont agree with all of this, but the shoutout to CAG is 100% dead on.  Whether youre looking to get the best deal when preordering a game thats about to come out or you want to pick up a handful of used games, theyve got by far the best compilation of deals. Users/TomGarberson

20101107 21:05:14 nbsp So to all the comparisons to Amazon and other online specific retailers, Gamestop provides you a storefront/brick and mortar location to get a majority of your gaming needs covered.  There are costs associated with manning and stocking the store, therefore they cant be as cheap as those online only guys.  Plus, in general, these guys are pretty nice and willing to help.  Buy something you dont like or doesnt work, theyll work with you.  Thats where we go when we need something for our Wii, PS3, or DSs. Vince, the manager is the best. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20110503 13:47:21 nbsp If I had to choose between the two in town, the one off Covell is pretty knowledgeable and really engaging. They also, have promotions unique to the plaza. They sometimes have promotions on trading and purchases. Only one real flaw from the one on Russell. I preordered a game with them way back and I remember them telling me some random excuse about why they did not have my reserved copy, but a friend pickup a copy because he was present at the midnight launch earlier in the week. Id say that situation was pretty weak. Havent had any problems over on Covell, but other than that they both are fine. Users/DarrenForrest

20110820 12:06:09 nbsp Both locations in Davis have a great staff and I always get help with what I need in terms of gaming. They also work with you to get the best deals, and are totally willing to order anything that may not be in store. I have bought a few things from them over my stay in Davis, and I have had nothing but good things to tell people about them. GameStop wouldnt be the same without the awesome staff. So thumbs up for sure!  Users/davisaggie1
