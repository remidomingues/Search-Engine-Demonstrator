Game Theory was an early80s Paisley Underground movement band whose members were from both Davis and Sacramento and which formed after the break up of local band Alternate Learning. The band often toured with fellow Davis musicians, Dream Syndicate and Thin White Rope.

Game Theorys first album, Blaze of Glory, was a limited printing of only 500 copies and was sent out to college radio stations wrapped in trash bags. The band released several albums since then, including The Pointed Accounts of People You Know (with the track Metal and Glass Exact that is featured on Davis Wiki Dot Org Slash Music), and Real Nighttime, released on Enigma Records. The original lineup broke up in 1985. But leadsinger Scott Miller continued on until 1990, when he started Loud Family.
