Games Plus was a tiny arcades arcade located where the The Hotdogger is now. It had about 13 games, including Ms. Pacman and Galaga (incredibly popular titles at the time.) They also carried a small selection of roleplaying games roleplaying supplies. The owner previously ran a hat store from the same location  Drop of a Hat.

Although Games Plus was the first arcade in Davis, it didnt stay in business much longer than a year or two due to competition from bigger arcades such as The Library and Atlantis. It closed its doors in 1983.
