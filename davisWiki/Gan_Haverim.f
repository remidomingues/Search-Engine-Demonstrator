Gan Haverim now offering Music Together classes with Karen Crane once a week!

Gan Haverim is the playbased Judaism Jewish schools preschool associated with the reform synagogue Congregation Bet Haverim Congregation Bet Haverim.  The school teaches a mixed aged group from 2 years to 5 years, utilizing an emergent curriculum that encourages the students to be independent thinkers and explorers.  (The teaching style and curriculum is influenced by the wiki:wikipedia:Reggio Emilia approach Reggio Emilia philosophy.)  Gan Haverim means garden of friends in Hebrew.
We embrace children of all faiths, ethnicities and backgrounds.

Philosophy

Jewish values create the school environment. We model and encourage kindness, compassion, respect and responsibility. Judaism teaches that the formative years of early childhood are vitally important. We want all children to feel competent, unique, nurtured and loved.  Our aim is to create a warm, caring and stimulating learning environment where children will grow in confidence and selfesteem.  At Gan Haverim, children have the opportunity to develop their natural curiosity, imagination and creativity. They are allowed time for creative thinking and exploration.

Curriculum

Gan Haverim follows a playbased or emergent curriculum. This means that we observe the children in our group to see where their interests are. Our activities may dramatically change from year to year depending on the needs of the children enrolled.

Every Thursday morning Karen Crane from Music Together leads our children in a fun, interactive musical group time. Every family is included in the Music Together program regardless of what days they attend.

Jewish values and holidays enrich our classroom curriculum and Shabbat is celebrated each Friday. The children learn about the Jewish holidays at their developmental level.

Rabbi Greg Wolfe joins the Gan Haverim children on Fridays to celebrate Shabbat as well as participating during holiday celebrations and visits to the Sanctuary.




20101004 23:10:34 nbsp My son has been at Gan Haverim for over a year now, and we couldnt be happier with it.  The kids are of all backgrounds and personalities, yet they seem to be like a big family.  Its got a wonderful, homey vibe with four of the coolest (and warmest!) teachers around.  Thanks to Rhoda, Nina, Naomi and Ashley for all your patience and love for the kids. Users/edubin

20101005 21:18:04 nbsp My daughter and son had have attended to Gan Haverim for over three years. They were happy to go there everyday. They were upset when there was no school because of Holiday or another reason. Preschool teachers were very friendly, skillful and patient with big sincere smile. Whole school looked like one big family. My kids learned English and Hebrew at the same time. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is seeking GOOD, QUALITY and SAFE education/play date atmosphere.

20101013 15:27:36 nbsp Our daughter attended Gan Haverim during 20092010. She enjoyed the preschool and we were extremely happy with the schedule, curriculum and staff.
מאוד מומלץ. הצוות מאוד נחמד ומאוד עוזר לילדים שלא דוברים אנגלית להתאקלם. אין יותר מדי דגש על יהדות, חוץ מקצת בחגים ובימי שישי. Users/MoranSegoli
 Editorial note: According to http://www.stars21.com/translator/hebrew_to_english.html this Hebrew to English translator, this translates as Highly recommended. Very nice staff and very helpful for children who speak English and acclimating. Not too much emphasis on Judaism, except some holidays and on Fridays.

20101016 21:42:09 nbsp I just have to chime in here, as its nice to give kudos to folks who work really hard. The teachers here are fantastic and I am always impressed with the variety of interesting learning projects/toys/activities that they have. My son absolutely loves coming. Users/LoraBarrett

20101026 11:29:10 nbsp My son has been attending Gan Haverim full program since May 2009 and we couldnt wish for a better preschool to meet our family needs. The staff is experienced and calm (they just deal with life as it happens; part of a good preschool environment IMO). More so, they LOVE children (sounds basic? this has not necessarily been my experience with other preschools in Davis). The program is versatile and dynamic and the atmosphere is warm, safe and happy. On more than a few mornings I wished I could just stay and spend the day in the school which feels more like a friends home than go to work... Users/noasafra

20110727 15:30:25 nbsp My daughter moved from one of the oncampus CDCs last year, and I couldnt be happier with the change. She hated going to the CDC and it made mornings a misery. She never brought home any artwork or anything else. It was hard to get a feel for her day or how much she did/did not participate. Now, she cant wait to get to school each morning, she brings home loads of beautiful, creative arts and crafts projects, and talks endlessly about what she ate, painted, played with and more. The staff are so kind and nurturing, not to mention creative, and they never hesitate to come up to me to tell me something cool that my daughter did that day. I cant recommend Gan Haverim enough!

20110729 13:01:43 nbsp My son just started at Gan Haverim and I could not be happier.  I spent a lot of time checking out all the preschools in Davis and Gan Haverim overranked all of them in cleanliness, creativity, kindness, and energy.  I cant say enough about the loving and caring teachers: Rhoda, Ashley, Nina, Megan, and others.  Within a few short days, I could see that my son was starting to feel safe, loved, and valued at this wonderful school. My son appears to love this school and looks forward to going even though he now knows that mommy and daddy cant stay with him.  This is huge for my son and I am very grateful to have found this loving, caring, creative, and nurturing environment for him.  I highly recommend this school for preschool aged children.

20120525 04:32:33 nbsp My son started at Gan Haverim recently and he absolutely loves it. I had to increase our days from 3 to 5 because on his off days he would cry that he couldnt go to school. The environment is that of a family daycare  very warm, noninstitutional. There are framed pictures of each child hanging on the wall. The director and teachers are kind, firm, and flexible. One of the teachers or the director gives me a report if something significant (e.g., a fall) has occurred during the day. Their approach is developmental and nonjudgemental (i.e., similar to the DPNS philosophy). I feel confident leaving my child in their care, knowing that he will be safe and have fun.
