Im not sure. I saw an elephant with a lot of arms holding a lot of tools. I think its an elephant who can fix anything.  Users/ArlenAbraham

Um, that would be Ganesh, one of the major Hindu gods, worshipped by Ganapatyas.  Its a Fixit service, general handyman work place.  I jog past it every morning.  Want pictures?  Users/JabberWokky

20050207 23:09:55 nbsp yeah, i know who ganesh is. i was just wondering there was actually a guy there who had lots of arms and was good at fixing things becasue he had so many arms Users/ArlenAbraham

20050208 10:56:17 nbsp I believe it is Ganesh who has all the arms, not the guy.  Unless the guy also has an elephant head.  Then all bets are off. Users/JabberWokky

20061027 17:13:50 nbsp Ganesh has been serving Davis for over 30 years.  They are completely dependable and highly ethical.  You can leave them at your ohuse to work unattended and they will not disappoint you.  They have done dozens of jobs for us and we have NO complaints.  Bill Cavins, the owner, was in the Peace Corps in Asia back when giant dinosauers ruled the earth.  He probably played with Ganesh when they were both children... Users/FreddieOakley Hey, thats not true. I wasnt allowed to play with elephants. Bill Cavins

20121016 17:04:47 nbsp Ganesh Works is a great company to hire for your handyman needs. I called them and although I needed to wait about 1 month for the work to be done, it was fully worth the wait. Chris, the tech who came out, was very professional, clean, communicated very clearly was able to complete all tasks I had requested. Prices were very reasonable as well. Thanks Ganesh!
