Yes, Ganesh is a Spiritual organizations Hindu god, a man with an elephant head, which is a story in itself.  Bob Morgan and Users/BillCavins Bill Cavins, fresh Peace Corps returnees from Nepal, started Ganesh Fixit in the Fall of 1972 at road 27 and 113 (before it was a freeway). They moved to Davis in 73 and were in two locations on Olive Drive before settling in at 1606 in the old Pac Tel switching facility.  They progressed from fixing whatever came in the door to entering doors all over the Davis area to do handyman work.   Bob long ago decided to get a real job at UCD in the Design Department.

Ganesh Fixit Shop
The Ganesh Fixit Ganesh Fixit Shop still exists as a place to bring stuff to be fixed.  Vacuums, lamps, and power tools can usually be repaired.  But please no more toasters, blenders or hairdryers which are not made to be repaired.  They do reglue and repair chairs and other small furniture.  They do minor welding, soldering, and gluing.  If anyone can figure out how to get one of those Dyson vacuums apart, they might be able to work on them.  They repaired a duck plucking machine once.  If parts dont have to be ordered, most things are fixed in a week and usually get done on Saturday morning when the boss is there.

20130329 13:46:47 nbsp It is disappointing when your expectations in a contractor are not fulfilled.  On two occasions now Ganesh has let me down.  The first occasion I asked them to install a dishwasher only to have my cabinets flooded. Mistakes happen, right?  This time I made an appointment to have them install a water heater. When I called two days before install they assured me that they had installed this model before.  When they arrived I got the word that they couldnt do it.  On top of that the agent told me to go $#?? myself.     Users/TomRichey
   They certainly seem picky about what they will and wont fix. Maybe they dont wish to make the same mistakes twice. Users/BrianKenyon
