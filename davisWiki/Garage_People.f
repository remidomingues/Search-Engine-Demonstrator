There is a Davis phenomenon in which people live in garages.

Such as:

  Griffin Walker lived in the garage of the Pirate Ship.

  Users/BudCutino lives in the garage of 720.

As you can see in this picture. Bud sleeps in the loft, many times with his girlfriend Caitlin: BR

  Brett Hart lives in the garage of the Empty House
   I once lived there.  Users/RishiTrivedi

  Users/GarrettPierce lives in the garage at the Gay PD.

  Users/JessicaLuedtke lived in a garage for the summer, in some house not cool enough to be worth mentioning. In fact, she might not even be able to find it anymore. It was hot.

  Users/BrendanBoyle lives in the garage at the The KDVS Is My Life House. Users/StevenValentino previously lived there.
