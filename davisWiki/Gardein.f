Gardein is a popular brand of vegan meat substitutes. The companys faux meats are impressively similar in taste and texture to real meats. Although Gardein is available at most grocery stores in Davis, the company makes many food items, so its common to find only a small selected range of availability at each store.

The beefless ground is an absolutely amazing ground beef substitute. Right now it can only be found at Target locally. In general, Target seems to have the best regular prices on Gardein products.
