We have many opportunities to garden in Davis. There are two community gardens, both of which are open to the general public.  The Experimental College manages a beautiful community garden on campus, known as the Experimental College Community Garden the EC Garden; this large garden covers a few acres of land, has a California native plants area, and even a communal orchard. The City of Davis also manages a pleasant Davis Community Garden community garden located on 5th Street. Both of these community gardens have been around since the 70s and are great places to learn about gardening, meet some good people, and grow some tasty organic Culinary Plants fruits and veggies.

 Davis Conditions 

Soil Davis soils vary from moderately sandy in South Davis south and east Davis, through loamy soils in central Davis, to heavy clay soils in West Davis west and north Davis. The heavy textured (clay) soils contain abundant shrinking and swelling minerals. Although this type of soil may appear to be difficult to work with, the high water holding capacity and nutrient supply make for an excellent growth medium. However, the rather hard dry consistency of these soils can severely hinder seed germination or initial root growth. Incorporation of organic material such as yard clippings or potting soil into these soils can greatly improve germination success.

Because of our soil type, youll most likely need to amend your soil with humus and/or llamas manure, creating holes to improve drainage and help your plants grow  bark, leaves, twigs, and compost are much bigger than clay/sand. Peat moss is too fine to improve drainage of clay soils. If youve got a yard, collect your leaves and lawn cuttings to create leaf mold or start a compost pile; the On Campus Coops have a compost demonstration that can help you get started. Soak your soil a few days before turning it over with compost, and let it dry just to a workable consistency so its not soaking, but its not like rock either. If you amend your planting beds annually with a couple inches of compost or manure (depending on your plants needs), you should be able to develop some pretty healthy soil conditions for most plants. If you dont plant during the winter months and dont plant green fertilizers, lay down a thick layer of mulch (this can even be shredded newspaper!) to keep down weeds and encourage worms  in spring, simply turn this into your planting area.

And though were blessed with a long growing season and mild winters, most plants grown in town will need to either be drought tolerant, able to withstand intense summer heat, or helped along by some shade and regular watering. Take a look at our Weather page to get an idea of Davis rainfall, when our seasons begin/end, and what the temperatures are at various times of the year. Davis is also in Sunset Zone 14, which reflects the effect of our locally famous southwest delta breeze that somewhat mitigates those summer highs, or at least lets us cool down a bit earlier in the day than Woodland. Davis winds typically come from either the southwest delta or north, with the latter arriving around March and October; as these northerly winds sweep down the valley, their speed increases significantly by the time they reach Davis, as allergy sufferers and Yolo Causeway commuters can attest. As far as gardening is concerned, it would be wise to avoid shallowrooted or brittle trees and provide some protection for windsensitive plants.

Now that youre up to speed on our local climate, our Culinary Plants page includes a planting calendar to help you get your vegetable garden started. As far as the landscape, California natives are a perfect choice for our climate and will be your lowest maintenance option. Subtropicals would probably be your next best bet, requiring only regular watering. If you choose to venture further afield into shade plants or exotics, be prepared to arrange to have somebody water your plants when you decide to leave town or risk spending a lot of money on cool plants that may not survive.

If your garden is successful, youll probably be able to give surplus away to friends. But if youre having trouble, consider the Surplus produce page, to contact hungry computer users.

 Apartment Gardening 
Stuck without a garden plot to call your own?  Get creative and bring the outdoors in!  You could easily just buy a flower pot, but you might also use containers that you already have around the house (around the apartment, that is).  If you start small, like with this tomatoplantinacan, you will need to move it to progressively larger containers as it grows.  Next step, milk jug.  Then, an old recycling bin (thanks for the tip Tim).  You can also cut the top off a 3 liter soda bottle for plants that dont require larger containers.  Always remember to poke holes in the bottom to drain excess water though, or else the roots will rot and the plant will die.

With an apartment garden you actually reap several benefits over an outdoor garden.  For one, you can move your plants around to follow the sunlight.  Even more important, youre no longer bound by mother natures bothersome changing of the seasons.  Whats more, having plants indoors adds oxygen and humidity to the air.  All this is not to mention the cancerfighting qualities of tomatoes.  You simply cant go wrong with an apartment garden!

Note: the nutritional information on the can does not apply to the tomato plant.


Weve become apartment garden happy in the last month.  Weve got two recycling bins (not new ones) many pots, and a wooden long box which serves as our lettuce row.  Weve even planted collards, turnips, radishes (we love radishes!) and squash in a 1 foot strip between the concrete of the driveway and the wall of the house.  The bloody things are surviving despite slugs, sow bugs, and countless years of motor oil, car wash suds and paint chips poisoning the soil!  Tasty too!



Anyone have tips for apartment gardening?
