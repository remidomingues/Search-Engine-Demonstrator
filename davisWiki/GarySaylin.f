I am best known for my music programming (reggae, Hawaiian and Latino/a) and production work at KDVS.

A long time resident and staff member at Shields Library, I also like to play solo instrumental guitar and ukulele performing at places like The Wardrobe and The Avid Reader. My ukulele music is half originals and half folk, International, blues, etc. I like to play the ukulele nonconventional to give it a new sound.

Just wondering: do you have a garret or carrel way back in the stacks somewhere you live in? Or something perhaps a bit plusher, a penthouse up on the roof set back from sightlines on the ground? Users/BrianOrr
