wiki:wikipedia:Gary_Lee_Yoder is a musician who grew up and still lives in Davis.

He is most often associated with his work from the 1960s, but he continues to perform on occasion as a solo artist.   Two of his bands, Oxford Circle and http://www.bluecheer.us/archive/kak.htm Kak, were originally formed in Davis but received most of their following in the San Francisco Bay area.  He was also a brief member of the legendary http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cheer Blue Cheer band.

He had his band perform at the Davis Farmers Market on Wednesday evening April 27, 2011.  This band for a few years has been called Gary Yoder and Friends.  Lately its been playing at the Farmers Market once a year.  Most of the musicians have been playing with him for about thirty years.  This time, since his drummer has been seriously ill, he had a  volunteer drummer named Jimmy Blazier.  When Jimmy was a teenager he drummed for wiki:wikipedia:Green_Day.  As he lived with his parents he couldnt move to continue with Green Day and so he missed their big commercial success.

Garys music has been featured on KDVS.
