Gary Saylin has had a KDVS radio show for many years and is part of the music scene. He currently works at Shields Library since he moved back to Davis in the late eighties. You may have heard him playing instrumentals on the nylon string guitar and tenor ukulele around town at The Avid Reader or The Wardrobe and even at a Pirate Ship concert. He sometimes mobile DJs playing a mix of reggae, Hawaiian, Latino/a, African and oldies. He also does a lot of production work at KDVS. Also, he enjoyed experiencing a 13,000 foot 60 sec. tandem freefall skydive at Skydance Skydiving earlier in 2014 as well as body surfing the past two decades in Hawaii.

His solo musical stage act name is both G. Whillikers SixString Band for guitar and Garys Ukulele for ukulele. Gary plays an instrumental mixture of International, blues, ambient and original folk semiclassical without amplification.
Garys act was called The Village Vanguard back in the 80s performing vocal originals like Do The Pinochet.
