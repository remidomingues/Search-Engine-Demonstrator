He likes things. This explains why he has thousands of interests, few of which are followed very far, resulting in an overburdened mind. Fortunately another thing he likes is Eastern philosophy, which affords him the ability to take the problems of his own mind with a grain of salt.

Chronicles of Interesting Crap

72005 A while ago a friend of mine whos studying at Berkeley was part of a http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/10/18_landscape.shtml landscape design project on campus that looked really fantastic. I wish I could have seen it in person but the pictures suggest the level of creativity and care that went into the project. Other beautiful landscape art includes http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html The Gates at Central Park that were up in January and February of 2005. There are links to pics on the main site but here are 2 quick links of a http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/sharedMedia/TheGates/update/tuesday/_H1U1462.jpg birds eye view and http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/sharedMedia/TheGates/update/tuesday/_H1U0905.jpg ground level pic with buildings in the background  very cool.

71005 The first (and greatest yet) entry in the Chronicles of Interesting Stuff is this outlandish piece of fiction I found today when I was wasting hours and hours online. It is on a site called http://www.nplusonemag.com/ n+1, which is apparently a cool little magazine about all kinds of things. Anyway, this piece (of crap, ha!) is a series of letters from the DMV to a lady named Molly and its mad funny. It may take a while to read but it is well worth the time. It should be posted on the main page, probably because it is new (I dont know their convention) but if it is not there by the time you check, Im sure you can search for it (author: Toby Barlow).

Interests

He loves music more than anything else. He makes various kinds of http://www.myspace.com/abe music that all center around innovative sampling techniques.

He spins records for money with his partner in crime, Scott Edwards, and also for recreation.

He takes pictures of anything that catches his eye like various scenes in New Orleans from Thanksgiving Break of 2002.


He speaks German, aber seiner Grammatik ist furchtbar weil er niemals uebt.

He is fascinated with economics. I know youre thinking but this guy sounded so cool a minute ago. Youll see... (shaking fist)

He enjoys messing with Web technologies such as CMSs (duh) and CSS (a limited list).

He likes Urban Art stencils and spray paint.

He is bored of writing his profile in the third person (because nobody else on Davis Wiki knows all this about him) and will now move on to adding Arboretum Gazebo obscure and inane information to the wiki.

Davis Baby for Peace peace out.
