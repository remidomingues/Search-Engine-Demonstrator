Gavino Pe単a was the son of early pioneer Juan Felipe Pe単a. When Juan died in 1863, Gavino inherited part of his fathers estate known as Rancho Los Putos, located in what is now known as Solano County. Gavino married Ruperta Vaca and they had a son named Jesus Pe単a. They lived on a ranch in Lagoon Valley for a time, but they eventually sold it and established another ranch on the far northern end of the familys estate near Putah Creek. Gavino died in 1902, at which point Ruperta sold the ranch and moved with her son into a home in Davisville. The residence became known as the Pe単a House.
