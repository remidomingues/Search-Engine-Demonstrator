Yolo Countys Gay Pride Day doesnt discriminate when it comes to orientation: people of all walks of life are welcome! Its a funfilled day with educational booths, acceptance, love, community, and delicious food.

More importantly, Gay Pride Day commemorates the anniversary of the Davis Civil Rights Ordinance. This ordinance which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was among the first of its kind in the United States. A challenge to the ordinance was overwhelmingly defeated by Davis voters. On this day the gay community and friends celebrate with festivities.

This year, food will be sold by:
  Monticello Bistro
