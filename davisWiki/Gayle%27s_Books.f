Gayles Books was located at what is now the north east corner of the E Street Plaza downtown (it predated the E Street Plaza though).  It was a fantastic, small, and independentlyowned bookstore with very helpful and friendly staff. Many people thought the best part of the bookstore was the sign in the window that read Ice Cream Eaters Welcome, which was a testament to the friendly nature of the store.

The store had two rooms. Both had clean white shelves that showed off their contents in a pleasing and uncluttered way. Many of their shelves were designed to show off the covers of the books that they held. The first room had the counter with the cash register. There was no computer, all sales were recorded by hand which increased the salespeoples knowledge of their wares.

It closed immediately after Borders came to town.  After they closed the The Avid Reader took over its space for use as their childrens section.  (Later the The Avid Reader had to consolidate back into their original store.)

Its a shame Borders killed them off, especially since Borders is now dead.  Anyway, great old local business. Users/OldDavis73
