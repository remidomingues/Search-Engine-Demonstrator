 Gearhead Records 



Gearhead has now split into two businesses; the label is run by Michelle Haunold in Woodland, Ca; Mike LaVella in Oakland, runs Gearhead Magazine.

Gearhead began as a magazine, and the first ten issues came with a 7inch. They made a decision in late 1999 to stop releasing the magazine with a 7inch and start Gearhead Records. In 2000, the label put out nearly a dozen records, and the last issue of Gearhead Magazine came out before it fell to the side for awhile, & then started up again in 2004.
