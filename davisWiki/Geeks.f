Not so long ago, the derogatory terms wiki:WikiPedia:Geek geek, nerd, and dork were used interchangeably.  Current usage is starting to separate the terms into orthogonal components. In this view, dorks are socially challenged individuals, nerds are people interested in intellectual or academic pursuits, and geeks are people fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of knowledge and imagination. Geek is the most general and positive of the three terms and lends itself to plenty of geek social structures subcultures.

The word geek can take on several different meanings. As discussed above, it can be a noun, used to label a person. It can also be a verb, used to describe two or more people (usually geeks) deeply engaged in conversing about some technical subject. Alternatively, it could describe a single geek deeply involved in some geeky act (such as computer programming). I have also heard it used in place of the verb to kill, but that may just have been cheap late 90s roleplaying manual prose at work, rather than valid cultural usage. It can be used as an adjective (in the form: geeky), used to denote that some action (or person) has geeklike qualities. The word geek originally referred to carnival performers who would do disgusting things for pay (a common example would be biting the heads off of live animals).

Some of the older geeks out there may remember a fad from the mid 90s, the http://www.geekcode.com/ Geek Code. Basically, it was a geeky way to let the other cool kids in the know figure out what sort of geek you were. So whats your geek code anyway?

  Someone with more knowledge of the wikis technical aspects should create the wikis own Geek code.
