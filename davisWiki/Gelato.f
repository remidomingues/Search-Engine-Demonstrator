Gelato (Italian for frozen) is Italian style ice cream, different from American style because it is not whipped with air, as ice cream is.  Gelato is also made with proportionally less cream than whole milk, so it has less butterfat than ice cream.  Because gelato in the United States is usually a gourmet food, it tends to be smoother and denser than average ice cream (just like gourmet American style ice cream).  When gelato is made poorly it tends to be hard and full of ice crystals.  When it is made well, it is smooth and light  a fine dessert.

20071003 19:47:39 nbsp The Konditorei page says that Bistro 33 also serves gelato.  Is there a gelatolovingBistro 33visting person out there who can confirm this?  If so, they should be added to this page; if not, they should be deleted from the Konditorei page. Users/CovertProfessor

20071003 19:56:22 nbsp Icekrimski is too expensive.  Especially if you want to eat in the theatre. Its got more flavors, but thats all it has going for it.  Zias is nice, cheaper, and goes great after a sandwich on a nice sunny day.  Konditorei gives you the most for your money by far, in a large glass.  Users/EdWins
 But Zias closes very early.  Im usually looking for a postdinner dessert, and Zias is no help there.  Same with Konditorei Users/CovertProfessor

20100324 21:58:42 nbsp Help! I need a place for decent green tea gelato now that Crepe House Uni is no more  Users/LeeY

20100324 22:01:31 nbsp Try hazelnut gelato (kids scoop size is enough) in a cup of coffee at Konditorei  much better and more satisfying than any Frappachino drink.  Users/LeeY
