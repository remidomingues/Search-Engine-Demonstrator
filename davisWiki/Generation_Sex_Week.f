Generation Sex Week is an annual event (or group of events if you will) put on by ASUCDs Gender and Sexuality Commission, and supported by groups like the LGBTRC, the WRRC, and the CCC. GenSex is a sexpositive event that aims to educate students about things like safe sex and sexual diversity, and acts as an encouraging environment in which students can learn about themselves and others in a positive way. In other words, Generation Sex Week is a series of week long programs/workshops aimed at facilitating healthy attitudes and fostering education on all forms of gender, sex and sexualitySee also Sexterpiece Theater.

  All GASC and Generation Sex Week events are free and open to all regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, ideology, class, citizenship, or handicap. ASUCD and GASC welcome ALL students to come and participate in the events. Many people came to celebrate, learn and have a great time.

  GenSex events do operate under voluntary Safe Zone safe zone guidelines,  and organizers ask that the attendees respect this request. A Safe Zone is an agreement to be respectful of all participants, presenters and attendees at an event. It also includes being nonjudgmental and nonassumptive about all involved. While the term safe zone may not be a legal term it does follow the UC Davis Principles of Community that some students uphold.

While Generation Sex Week is not the same quarter EVERY year, it has become a Winter Quarter event: The hottest week in winter!
