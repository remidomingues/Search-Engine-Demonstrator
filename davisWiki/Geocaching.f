wiki:WikiPedia:Geocaching Wikipedia: Geocaching is an outdoor sport that involves the use of a wiki:wikipedia:Global Positioning System GPS (Global Positioning System)  receiver to find a geocache (or cache) placed anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small, waterproof container containing a logbook and treasure. Geocaching is a unique take on a traditional Easteregg hunt in that it uses two recent technologies, the GPS and the Internet.

If you dont feel like making the financial investment in a GPS, you can give LetterBoxing a try (or just try to find them without a GPS; one person has found over 800 without a GPS at all).

It is possible to rent GPS units http://www.travelbygps.com/travel.php#GPSrental has one option.  Its about $25 for a 3day weekend.

 Geocaching in Davis 


Davis has lots of geocaches spread all throughout the area. You probably walk by a couple every day not even knowing it. Please dont ruin the fun of the sport by revealing the location or details of caches you find. It would also be taboo to map them. Have Fun!
