Geography is a program that is no longer officially offered at the undergraduates undergraduate level at UC Davis.  Courses were available until Fall 2006 under the Environmental Design Department of Environmental Design, but was http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/04/03/CampusNews/Uc.Davis.To.Completely.Phase.Out.Geography.Program.Next.Academic.Year1777039.shtml?norewrite200604110723&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com phased out. Its a shame, because it was an awesome major that used to teach students a ton about understanding the world we live in. It would be an awesome day if it ever got brought back. However if youre interested in lobbying the administration to do so, you best hurry before they phase out the rest of the professors for it.

The Geography Graduate Group is strong at 70+ students as of 2007 and is recognized in the academic geography community as producing excellent graduates. As a graduate group, the geography community is spread across campus, but you will find Geography Graduate Group GGG students as TAs and researchers for Landscape Architecture LDA, Community and Regional Development CRD, Environmental Science and Policy ESP, Environmental Resource Science ERS, Anthropology ANT, Sociology SOC and just about anything wiki:wikipedia:GIS.  The programs headquarters are on the first floor of Hunt Hall.

Geography graduate students have a tradition of being involved in the campus and city community.  Many geography students have served in the Graduate Student Association.  Students successfully lead the informationgathering initiative to help overturn the decision to close the program in 2008.  Several students helped document the protest of the UC Davis Students PepperSprayed pepper spraying in 2011.  Students helped create Geospatial Consulting @ UC Davis to address the needs of the campus community for map making and geospatial research.

GLOBAL:geography club, was started on campus in 2006 by some members of the Geography Graduate Group. The group plan to hosts dialogs about geography stuff on campus, run field trips and facilitate student participation in professional geographic societies.
