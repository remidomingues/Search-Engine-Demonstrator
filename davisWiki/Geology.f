The geology of Yolo County is in the wiki:WikiPedia:Central_Valley_(California) Great Valley which is generally wiki:WikiPedia:Sedimentary_Rock sedimentary with the exception of wiki:WikiPedia:Volcanic_Rock volcanic rock in the wiki:WikiPedia:Sutter_Buttes Sutter Buttes. The Sutter Buttes are not in Yolo County, but are part of the Great Valley.  Our Soil soils here are generally quite clayey with varying amounts of silt; they are fantastic in general for agricultural purposes (hence the $300,000,000 Ag economy in Yolo County)

The Northern Coast Range rocks are wiki:WikiPedia:Mesozoic older wiki:WikiPedia:Sedimentary_Rock sedimentary than those of the Valley.   The nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains Sierra Nevada is mostly wiki:WikiPedia:Granite granitic rock in the south and more wiki:WikiPedia:Metamorphic_Rock metamorphic rock in the foothills and the north.  Both deposited most of the sediments that Davis sits on.
