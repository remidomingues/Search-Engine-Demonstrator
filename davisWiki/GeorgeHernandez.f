Welcome to the Wiki, George!  I love the work in the gallery for Sacred Tiger.  If youre interested in sharing, some information on your history as an artist would be a great addition to the page.  Some really beautiful ink there.  When you have a moment, please see the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner page for some valuable information on what to expect from a business page on the wiki.
