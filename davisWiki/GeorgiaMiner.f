Hey, I can see youre using the same computer address as Users/LizBennet.  If you are her and attempting to look like multiple people, please note that this is an open site where everybody can look at the connection history.  If youre a different person using the same connection, thats fine, but its not considered honest to engage as sockpuppets, so please dont do that.  Honesty is good, okay?

I would, but I dont have unlimited time.  I do what I can to help add to the wiki.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

Georgia, Im not trying to hurt anybody.  Why doesnt she want the links there?  It appears she is just trying to erase the accident, which does not seem to be a healthy activity.  If shes as distraught as you say, this is a horrible activity youre engaging her in.  Look up at the title  its a tragic event.  Perhaps you should try to comfort her so shes not looking up media coverage of her fathers death on a holiday weekend.  Please, for her sake, guide her off the computer.  The death of a loved one provokes a multitude of emotional responses, and I cant possibly imagine that the two of you trawling the internet is helping her.   My heart goes out to you both.
