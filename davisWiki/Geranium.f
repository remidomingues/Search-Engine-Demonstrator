What gardeners commonly call Geraniums are Pelargonium species and hybrids, not to be confused with some native wildflowers and herbaceous perennials that are truly of the genus Geranium. All are within the Storkbill family (Geraniaceae), along with their cousins, Filaree. Geraniums are one of the most reliable herbs and bushes grown in the home garden and add color from spring through late fall. Grown both indoors or outdoors as perennials in Davis, geraniums (Pelargoniums) should receive six to eighthours of weather full sun to produce abundant blooms and are frost intolerant. Scented type geraniums in particular should receive full sun to develop the fragrant volatile leaf oils. Scented geraniums are somewhat more frosttender than those types grown for their flowers; planting these in a south or eastfacing exposure can provide added winter warmth.
Soil should be reasonably well draining, although they are not fussy so long as you dont water too often. Mulching helps reduce high summer soil temperatures and plants should be watered weekly at ground level. Remove the flowers as they fade to encourage bloom production.

Most geraniums root easily from stem cuttings, and many cultivars must be propagated this way to maintain desired flower and/or leaf color, shape and scent. Propagate in the fall, allowing for 3 to 4 weeks of warm weather for rooting to take place. While relatively pest & diseasefree, some of the problems affecting geraniums include botrytis or mildew, rust, blight and black leg; in addition to these bacterial/fungal diseases, geraniums can be attacked by invertebrates such as slugs & snails slugs, aphids and butterflies & moths caterpillars of the geranium budworm. Organic control measures exist for all these pests.

True Geraniums are easytogrow herbaceous perennials for sun or partial shade. Most bloom in spring and early summer; some varieties continue to bloom through the summer and into fall. They are propagated by division in fall or spring.

Zonal Geraniums (Pelargonium x hortorum) are the most commonly found geranium. Sold as bedding plants, they are compact and often have fancy leaves marked by distinct markings. Flowers may be single or double, are clustered into heads, and may range from red, pink, salmon, and white.

Martha Washington Geraniums (Pelargonium x domesticum) are typically sold as a flowering indoor plant. Because it is not heat tolerant, it may not perform as well outdoors as zonal geraniums.

IvyLeaved Geraniums (Pelargonium peltatum) have a vinelike habit with smooth, leathery leaves and flowers with narrower petals and less dense flower heads.

Scented Geraniums have a wide range of foliage types and habits, make excellent houseplants, and often have soft, finely textured foliage, and small, demur flowers.
