In an article in the Sacramento Bee (December 10, 2006, Page B1) Buddingh expressed concern over comments made on the Davis Wiki regarding Grace Valley Christian Center:

Rev. Gerrit Buddingh, the associate pastor of Grace Valley Christian Center, said church leaders werent happy to find allegations accusing Grace Valley of being emotionally and spiritually abusive to its members.  Buddingh said church leaders asked that the page be removed, but to no avail. They also decided litigation wasnt a good Christian solution in this instance. Theres no practical way to achieve vindication, he said.
