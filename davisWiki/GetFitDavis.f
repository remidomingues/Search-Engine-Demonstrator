20130814 13:42:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Welcome to the Wiki! Thank you for joining us. Editors have realized that Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts (accounts not tied to one particular person, but instead to a faceless organization) were causing problems on the wiki, and decided to disallow such accounts. So, I would ask that you close this account and reopen one under your name or a distinctive pseudonym. To do this, click settings in the upper right hand corner, change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and then press Save. Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under a new username. For further information please read Welcome to the Wiki. Thank you for understanding. Users/CovertProfessor
