Thank you so much. Bob Clark Users/BClark

20121130 17:07:20 nbsp I was trained by the new owner for triathlons and he is very enthusiastic and motivating.  He knows a lot about nutrition and fitness, I enjoyed working with him.  I dont usually like personal trainers but I liked Nick. Users/DagonJones

20121201 18:46:19 nbsp A little over a year ago, at the age of 54, I decided I needed to start a regular fitness program but I was scared. Nick changed my fear into “I can do it.” I began with personal training sessions with Nick and within one month I felt like a different person. I had more energy and more confidence in myself. I started to believe that anything is possible. All because of Nick’s “can do” attitude and believing in me.
He asked me to join his triTRAINed program and that’s all I needed. After three triathlons and placing 4th place in my age group, I realized that anyone can accomplish their goals no matter your age. Because of Nick’s positive attitude, commitment, sense of humor and simply caring about you as a person, I was able to go beyond what I thought I could ever do!
Nick has changed my life and I will always be grateful. I will never stop exercising because Nick makes exercise fun! I count my blessings that I met Nick and I look forward to continuing my journey with him. Thank you, Users/debwillis

20130318 16:15:46 nbsp Love, love, love the child care here.  Ive been bringing my kids to the gym with me for almost 5 years now, and the child care at Get Fit Davis is the #1 reason Im a devoted member.  My kids love going there and are well cared for.  Whats more, they engage in lots of interactive play while theyre at the child care  no sitting in front of a movie.  They color, build, have books read to them  I cant say enough about how awesome the child care staff are.  Having excellent child care available while I work out is such a blessing in my life.

I wanted to take a moment to let you know that I have just completed my first month of membership at Davis Get Fit and that I have been very pleased by my experience during the past month. I am a 66 year old fitness enthusiast and appreciate the breadth of training opportunities that are available at Davis Get Fit. Since joining I have been a regular participant in Tuesday and Thursday Spin Classes as well as utilizing the various other exercise opportunities on my own. The staff are very friendly and helpful and I appreciate the attention paid to keeping the facilities clean and inviting. Perhaps the greatest experience during this first month was my personal introduction to TRX Training provided to me by Cecily Bailey. The introductory session was very informative and challenging since it was learning by doing. I really appreciated how Cecily listened to my training history and took special note of some prior injuries that had been issues for me. Cecily, besides being an inspiration as evidenced by her own personal fitness and enthusiasm for TRX was extremely thorough in explaining each exercise, the importance of engaging the core, and adhering to good form practices. As it turns out TRX is just the training I have been looking for but did not know anything about it. Cecily enthusiasm for TRX was contagious and upon completing the introductory session I signed up for 10 of her sessions and am well on my way with TRX training. High Fives All Around!
During my introductory session I shared with Cecily that my training goal has been to make 70 the NEW 45. She responded by saying “Bill you’re already there so with TRX I think you should modify your goal to 70 the NEW 35!” I am not yet a Navy Seal but I am very pleased by the progress I have made in just three weeks. The TRX is a great addition the the extensive walking/hiking, spinning, and yoga that are part of my regular fitness program. TRX is a great strength builder while maintaining flexibility and being joint friendly! I look forward to great times now and in the future at Davis Get Fit and with TRX.

20130812 19:53:07 nbsp Went in today for the first time. I had received a coupon for three free days from a very friendly rep, and decided that I would use it. Being I just graduated and no longer have access to the arc, I am looking for a gym. Though the gym is small, it is clean and nice. The reason I doubt I will be buying a membership is the staff. Though they were polite, they were not very helpful. After I gave the man at the front desk the card, he just said it was good for three days and waved me off. I wasnt shown around or told where anything was. I even had to come back to get a locker key. I would think a business that had been doing all the advertising it has would have had great customer service when it comes to new potential members.  Users/SarahReno

 We want to sincerely apologize for this. Great customer service to potential members, as well as our current members, is of the utmost importance to us. We have talked with our front desk staff and reiterated that importance to them. Thank you for taking our phone call and discussing the situation with us so we can move on in a positive direction. Users/GetFitDavis

20130826 11:37:25 nbsp Dear Nick and Katie,
We want you to know how much we value and appreciate Sammie, Katherine, and the other child care providers. they are a significant reason we are members at your gym.
The environment is always safe and fun for the children. We have 2 girls, currently 4 and 5. We have been members for a couple of years now, and they love coming to the gym. What stands out the most is that the child care providers are genuinely interested in the kids. They play and interact with them. They make sure the kids are having a good time. They also provide a safe and clean environment for our children at Get Fit Davis. We especially like that there is not a TV in the room. this is very important to us. The positive experience you provide for our children makes it possible for us to come to the gym. We are so impressed, that we now hire several of the providers to babysit and housesit for us. they are as professional in our home as they are at Get Fit Davis.
We tell all our friends about the quality child care we get as part of our Get Fit Davis membership, and encourage them to visit your gym. thank you for your attention to this detail.

Sincerely,
Pippin and Janice B.  Users/JanicePoppinB

20140122 10:10:11 nbsp The purpose of this letter is to thank you for including the TRX/ RIPP program at your club.
I come from a background of competitive athletics.  I was selected for three years as All American in the sport of triathlon. I was national champion for 50 year olds in the Olympic distance triathlon, and completed two Ironman Triathlon Championships in Kona, Hawaii. For the past 30 years my interest has been swimming, riding and running faster than my competition. My training consisted of training 40 hours a week in the three disciplines. Each week I would have to introduce myself to my wife and kids so that they would allow me to enter our home, because they never saw me.
Several months ago my wife Shelley started the TRX program with Cecily and would enthusiastically describe her exercise routine to me. She told me about this little woman who conducted the sessions. I would respond, ”Yes dear, that’s nice.”  Shelley had been spinning and working with weights, but even though she loves spinning for it’s lower body and cardio benefits, I never saw any real change in her physique . Then, after working with Cecily, her triceps began to tighten up, she developed biceps and core strength that she had never had before………my God what was happening? She said “ You should do this Forrest.” I told her I wasn’t going to take anything taught by a “Little woman.”  Well, I did go . I met Cecily and I tried the introduction to TRX for an hour and a half.  I am now a disciple and will follow Cecily to the fires of hell. I think she can turn water to wine.
TRX and Ripp isolate and work all the muscles that have been sleeping. The program develops your core and allows you to maximize your body’s potential. It combines aerobic and anaerobic exercises to make you stronger and more flexible while increasing your oxygen carrying capacity. My interest is not body building from an aesthetic perspective.  I just want be in great shape and beat everyone I go up against.
I find that my running stride has increased that my back does not ache after several hours in the saddle. I know that my stroke in the water will have more power. TRX and RIPP complement every other sport and enhance the specific muscles used in each athletic event. Spinning and working with weights are great and can be made greater by utilizing the TRX and RIPP program.
TRX and RIPP are revolutionary and I believe there will be clubs devoted just to this program. It is safer than lifting weights. Results are realized sooner. It is a perfect balance of everything you want if your are interested in developing your body to perform as it was designed. I believe that coaches around the world will incorporate the TRX and RIPP concept into their programs, no matter what sport.

20140602 12:59:27 nbsp I wanted to send a big cheer out to Get Fit Davis gym. The owners Nick and Katie have done a beautiful

job!

I like gyms, but I have not been to a gym in quite a while. I don’t know whylack of motivation, lack of

energy, lack of hope to make any real long term progress, busyness, being a mom, life, etc., etc., etc.

There really are so many excuses.

I decided to give Get Fit Davis a try. I went for a few training sessions with Nick, the owner since he had

helped a friend of mine turn her “mommy arms” into “Michelle Obama meets Linda Hamilton arms”.

Yes, her arms are that awesome. A few sessions with Nick, and I was hooked. Nick with his great sense

of humor, as well as his upbeat energy moves us through the treadmill and weights and back to the

treadmill with ease. By the end of the hour, I am thoroughly sweaty and strangely rejuvenated. Who

knew? Exercise really does help to clear your mind and body and boost your energy.

The gym is beautiful and clean. There are multiple trainers like Thomas walking around, helping all

of us who are not quite doing the correct moves. One slight angle adjustment, and you really feel the

difference. Then you are on the way to getting the results you want. All of the employees are cheerful

and helpful.

I hear story after story of how Nick helped someone lose a significant amount of weight and achieve all

of their fitness goals. I am inspired.

Nick and Katie are part of what makes Davis great. They eagerly help out at the elementary school

auctions by donating gym memberships. With just a passing mention of helping a charity, Nick was quick

to organize a fun run to raise money for JDRF. Nick and Katie make good things happen.

The best part of Get Fit Davis is (flashback to Cheers sitcom) that when I walk in to the gym, I feel like

part of the family where everyone knows my name…...

I am truly impressed, amazed and so happy that I have a new gym.

I feel more hopeful that this time I can achieve my fitness goals for the long term, and I can have fun

while I’m getting there. Get Fit Davis is some innovative gym!

20140816 16:34:29 nbsp It would be great if they allow a day rate like $5 or $7.50, if you want to visit whenever you want without the obligation to get a 2 weeks, month, half year or subscription. I wonder why they are no offering that too. Maybe they need the insurance of knowing people will return?
But for free birds like myself, I would like to have the day option too. Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140818 10:38:16 nbsp A few times Ive been in it was....smelly.  To a degree that made me question whether I wanted to maintain a membership there.  Granted, Im usually coming at the end of the day, so maybe its fresher in the AM.  Still, I might not claim good ventilation.

On the positive side, they can also offer discounts to members of Davis Bike Club! Users/HeatherCampbell
