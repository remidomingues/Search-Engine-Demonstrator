Ghost Dad is the greatest cover Music Scene band in the history of ghost dads. The have played only one show, and it was perfect. For this reason, they will never play again. Oh, dont cry. Please. No, seriously, stop that. Im not good with this emotional crap. Youre embarrassing me  for cryin out loud, get over it. OK, forget it. Im out of here.

Ghost Dad remains the only instance where a Ghost, a Dog and the resurrected corpse of Andy Warhol took the stage together.

 Ghost Dad reconvened briefly in January 2006 under the pseudonym hey dude, whats up in Englewood California to record their currently untitled magnum opus during an acid trip.  The resulting stroke of brilliancecurrently being masteredis expected for release some time in the indefinite future.
