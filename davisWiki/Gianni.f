20081029 23:48:12 nbsp Why are you editing Gianni when there is this page? Users/JasonAller

20081108 19:03:31 nbsp There is a difference between a personal page (like this one) and a public figure page (like Gianni RosasMaxemin). Traditionally there has been a separation between a public figure page and a personal page. It is considered poor form to remove information from your own public figure page. Users/JasonAller

20090225 20:28:32 nbsp I removed the information since I am no longer running for senate, but thank you for noting the importance of my information and putting it back up.  Users/Gianni

20090226 03:32:04 nbsp I honestly dont see what you have against the word slate. ACT is a slate. It fits the definition. i.e. Slates are UC Davis school government candidates version of political parties on Campus. While some view them as cliques, many in ASUCD recognize their purpose in providing support and assistence to candidates and senators.

ACT ran senate candidates, providing support and assitance to them. ACT has a platform with set goals, like all other slates/political parties.

Lets call a spade a spade here. You arent fooling anyone, youre coming off as immature by consistently denying the fact that ACT is a slate. Maybe you feel ACT transcends traditional boundaries of political organizations, i.e. slates. Thats great. It doesnt however transcend boundaries set by definition, especially the consensus ones of the Daviswiki community. Users/MattBlair

20090226 11:02:27 nbsp Seriously, stop changing it back. ACT is a slate, get over it. Users/MattBlair

20090226 11:13:47 nbsp Whatever makes you happy... but it would be false to encapsulate definition as your reason because by definition, ACT is not a slate. You cannot register as a slate on UC Davis, it is important for people to shake off this idea because the connotation of slate has been polluted by previous organizations. Here is your definition  a list of candidates for nomination or election (Merriam Webster). We can argue semantics for as long as the dictionary supports me and until SPAC starts registering slates, I will call ACT an organization. However, this does not stop you from changing the wording on daviswiki. I understand you are in LEAD and like to stir up trouble, however neither of these extracurricular activities makes you the expert nor does it give you the proper equipment to call anything immature. Users/Gianni
 Get over yourself. https://elections.ucdavis.edu/results/elec_10/senate_win09.blt The official ballot says ACT is a slate. That means you guys presented yourselves as such to the elections committee. Silly ASUCD drama whores... when will you learn that we dont care about your cutesy little political aspirations? Users/WilliamLewis
 For the sake of information, I would like to point out that Merriam Webster is not the sole source of definitions.  Here is one example from the ASUCD Bylaws: A “Slate” is any group of candidates and/or Tickets who run together under a common name or common slogan.  Bylaw 401 B.  ACT in this past election appears to have fit this definition quite nicely.
   Yeah, it was intended to be a pretty loose definition.  I wrote it so that we couldnt have any punishments against a slate, but to make it easier to do endorsements.  While the idea of a slate may have bad connotations to some people, ACT is clearly a slate and LEAD is clearly a party.  To see why... well, just go read Slate.   Users/BrentLaabs

20090226 11:19:06 nbsp Im not in any ASUCD thingy, and never have been.  Youre arguing spirit vs letter of the definition in a ludicrous way. Nowhere in the definition of slate does it say the group must be registered as a slate. Thats a silly argument: becuase then we can say theres no such thing as a slate anywhere.  The definition from Wikipedia has this right below the main definition: The common platform may be because the candidates are all members of a political party or have the same or similar policies, or simply that they are a group of friends.  Slate is a general term. And it is exactly what every single group/political party in ASUCD actually is.  Same political party, similar policies, or a group of friends.    You may dislike the connotation of the word and want to not try to use it, but that doesnt change the fact that thats still what it is.    Users/EdWins

20090226 11:20:02 nbsp I would still like to point out that if it is on the wiki, it needs to conform to the standards of the wiki, which includes the publicly accepted definitions the wiki presents. I would also like to explain to you why such matters are important for conformity on this type of website.

However, I shall not for I have trouble to go stir up. Users/MattBlair
