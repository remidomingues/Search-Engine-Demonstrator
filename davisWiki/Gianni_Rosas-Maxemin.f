Gianni RosasMaxemin is an independent candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2008 ASUCD Election.


Gianni RosasMaxemin can be described as a Doer. Someone that wakes up in the morning and makes positive changes in society, one step at a time. To the student he is known as the book worm, to the family he is known as the Soprano, to the business partner he is known as the rake and for everyone else he is known as Gianni. He is exceptionally hard working, motivated, energetic and engaged with a profound interest in society, judicial values, helping and contributing to the wellbeing of others.

  Active member of Theta Xi Fraternity,
  External Affairs Commissioner (EAC) for UC Davis,

  Captain of the Palo Alto High Varsity Wrestling Team,
  Statewide experience for Student Government at: SSCCC, COUGH, PUENTE and CCCSAA.

Platform Issues:
As a Senator I will make sure our UC Davis degree holds the highest value with the best diverse faculty in both ethnicity and opinion. I will make sure the course load is highly competitive so that when we graduate and UC Davis rises, our majors will become a more valuable commodity in the marketplace. If elected, I will work with the Downtown Business Association and bike shops in Davis to provide downtown discounts. Growing up in a college town, I witnessed all of downtown Palo Alto welcome their local Stanford students with handsome discounts. WE CAN TOO! During high season when Davis stores are flooded with student purchases and bike prices never seemed to be so high, it would be nice to find a cheaper resource locally.
Lastly, students NEED feel protected. In spring 2008, the governor made cuts across the board which was essential for many undergraduate students. An additional cut is in process this fall quarter. I can promise to be an advocate for financial aid students every quarter by making sure the Financial Aid office receives minimal budget cuts.

20081111 15:13:45 nbsp Since you plan on working with the DDBA and other businesses in Davis, do you have any plans to either: (a) increase sponsorships for units such as Cal Aggie Camp, (b) increase advertising income for units such as Classical Notes or The California Aggie? Users/BrentLaabs

20081111 23:41:11 nbsp I think Gianni will make a good Senator. I havent been blown away by him, but he hasnt made me leery of him either. If I were voting for more than two people, he would be my number 3 pick. If Garettt pulls a Biseto, I see GRM getting elected. Even if that doesnt happen, he still strikes me as the independent most likely to win. Users/JoseBleckman
