Gilad is a 2008 UC Davis undergraduate. He majored in Computer Science, and currently works at Cisco Systems in San Jose CA, doing client side developement for the iPhone. Gilad greatly misses Davis and the many amazing people he met there, so he takes every opportunity to do recruitment for Cisco at Davis. Look for him during any engineering related job fair!

The tenants were given a substantial reduction in rent during the construction.  Plus when it is done it will be a really wonderful place to live.  No pests, no vermin, new sewer, new electrical, new plumbing, new heat, new air conditioning, access to a huge basement, landscaping maintained by owner, steps away from the University and downtown, local landlord that has a good history of responding to tenants.
