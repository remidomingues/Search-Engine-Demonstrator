Gilmore Hall is one of four High Rises highrise residence halls in the Segundo area and was named for John W. Gilmore. It has five floors, an elevator, lounge with a tv and piano. Each floor has a kitchen. Each room has two beds that can be lofted or lowered, a book case, a desk and drawers. There are also two closets. The bathrooms are high school locker room style with shower stalls. Wear your flip flops! Gilmore is the closest highrise to the DC and the ARC, thus giving it the best location in Segundo.

 Freshman Antics 
 On December 3rd, 2005 A.D., diners in the Segundo Dining Commons D.C. were shown some Gilmorian antics, as the girls of 414 proceded to dance by their window (at least one later holding up a sign listing their room number), perhaps in an attempt to get some Sex sex.

 The top floor, Gilmore 5 is usually referred to as the Penthouse.

  In 20082009 Gilmore 2 was known as the party floor
