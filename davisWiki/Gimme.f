20090530 16:26:27 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Several of the links youve added have been removed because they resembled spam. In some cases they were commercial, and in other cases just not relevant to the purposes of the Davis Wiki. For things like Autism maybe you can consider going to wiki:wikispot:Front Page Wiki Spot and checking if there is a wiki dedicated to autism. Ask if you have questions. Users/JasonAller
