Since 1917, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America have been selling Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods cookies to raise funds. Top sellers can earn prizes for their hard work and there are incentives for units as well.  You can get the cookies from one of our local girl scouts. A box of cookies in Davis costs $4 as of 2013.

In 2013, Scouts were spotted going doortodoor as early as January 12.

Those who support rights of transgendered people may wish to buy http://www.youtube.com/watch?vTD41W5mIWmY& extra cookies this year.

 Varieties Offered 

The GSUSA requires licensed baking companies to offer Thin Mints, Peanut Butter Sandwiches, and Shortbreads each year. Popular favorites such as Caramel Delites or Samoas and Peanut Butter Patties or Tagalongs are usually available each year as well. Other varieties offered vary from year to year and the exact names and compositions of the cookies differ depending on which baking companies are licensed. You can find ingredients and nutrition information on the http://www.girlscoutcookies.org/nutrition_info_2009_2010.asp?iframetrue&width940&height500 Girl Scout Cookies website. Predictably, theyre about as loaded with calories and fat as they are delicious.

     Mango Cremes with NutriFusionâ„¢: Sandwich of Vanilla or Coconut wafers with Mangoflavored filling (palm oil).  Its the healthy cookie for this cookie season.  Theres no actual mango, thoughits all artificial/natural flavors.  NutriFusion is a vitamin supplement compounded from plantbased whole food concentrate.  The component foods are cranberry, pomegranate, orange, grape, strawberry, shitake mushrooms.  This additive puts Vitamins A, B1, B6, C, D, E, and Calcium into the cookie in Nutrition Factsworthy quantities.  All the cookies contain a labeled quantity of Iron because of Enriched Wheat Flour.

The following varieties are vegan: Thanksalot, Lemonades, Thin Mints, Peanut Butter Patties.  All the Girl Scout cookies are Kosher.


They are now offering far fewer varieties than in previous years. Also, the boxes are smaller and some cookies are actually smaller than they used to be! Heresy! Delicious heresy.

 Where to Buy 
Usually you can find cookie booths in front of supermarkets and such sometime in February:

  Farmers Market
  Nugget
  Safeway
  Save Mart

Or answer your door when the Girl Scouts come calling (or respond when your coworker hits you up, or....)

 Where to Eat 

Strolling across the quad, with a partner in sex bed (watch out for Robert Crumb crumbs), while bicycling (takes real skill), at your employment office desk.  Somewhere right now, Users/JasonAller somebody is eating cookies.  Yum.


20100228 23:14:13 nbsp Heads up on the lemon chalet cookies: theres a recall.  Users/EdWins

20100302 20:05:59 nbsp Unfortunately Girl Scouts do not go door to door anymore citing safety reasons. Users/hankim
  I have firsthand information that this is false.  Perhaps they only go to neighbors who they know and who are in their immediate vicinity, but they definitely go.   Users/CovertProfessor
    I guess I do not see any because I live in an apartment complex. I still get Biblepushers and such though, but they do not have cookies. Users/hankim
     Im sorry.  cp
      Heres a great idea: they should print Bibleverses on cookies.  Or fortune style cookies.  At least then more people will listen to their message/spiel, or at least keep the door open longer <.<
       Hopefully there are no more Heavens Gaters to read this. Users/hankim
     Do you get Halloween trick or treaters?  Im betting theres a pretty good correspondence between door to door Girl Scout cookie sales and trick or treating. jw

20110128 10:58:20 nbsp I was a girlscout well up until I was 16. The cookies have become more and more of a ripoff.  Smaller sizes, fewer to a box and prices going up.  Meanwhile troops are getting less and less money from the sales.  If you really want to support a chapter, just donate money or time directly to them.  Hell they can probably bake you a batch of cookies for less. Users/OliviaY
