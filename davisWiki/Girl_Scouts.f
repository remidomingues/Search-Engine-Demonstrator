The Girl Scouts of Davis are a femaleonly Scouting organizations organization for Davis youth.  Their headquarters are in Slide Hill Park.  Davis has an extremely active Girl Scouting community with over 700 registered Girl Scouts within Davis.

Local Girl Scouts are part of the http://www.girlscoutshcc.org Girl Scouts Heart of Central California, the regional council. The Davis Service Unit is #119.

Girl Scouts includes several age/gradebased divisions, each with their own activities, uniform, and patches. These divisions include:

     Daisy Girl Scouts for age 5 or in kindergarten
     Brownie Girl Scouts for grades 13 or ages 68
     Junior Girl Scouts for grades 46 or ages 911
     Cadette Girl Scouts grades 79 or ages 1214
     Senior Girl Scouts for grades 1012 or ages 1517

There are one or more troops, or small groups of girls and their leaders, within each age division.

Their public visibility peaks each year during the time when they sell Girl Scout Cookies without permits to sell/resell and in violation of city solicitation and loitering ordinances. The girl Scouts of America have been targeted for this activity in other states, although not yet in California.

IN 1992, The Girl Scouts of America have also been charged and found guilty of discrimination against others such as Atheist and http://www.bsadiscrimination.org/html/gsusaproblems.html#921222 ordered to allow their admittance. Since that order has taken effect, the GSoUSA have allowed Atheists and others into the organization and allows them to alter the Girl Scout Motto according to their beliefs, substituting the word God.

The Girl Scout Motto:

On my honor, I will try:
To serve God and my country,
To help people at all times,
And to live by the Girl Scout Law.

The Girl Scout Law:

I will do my best to be
Honest and fair,
Friendly and helpful,
Considerate and caring,
Courageous and strong, and
Responsible for what I say and do,
And to
respect myself and others,
respect authority,
use resources wisely,
make the world a better place, and
be a sister to every Girl Scout.

The Girl Scout Motto:

Be Prepared.
