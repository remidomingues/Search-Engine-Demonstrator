20111208 23:25:44 nbsp I had an appointment with Giselle earlier this week and I have to say she is a fabulous stylist!  I had a lovely experience.  I felt as though Giselle really listened to what style I was looking for and gave me some great suggestions.  She gave me a shampoo, an awesome cut, and flatironed my hair.  I am so happy with the results!  Will DEFINITELY be seeing her again.      Users/AynReyes

20111212 21:10:21 nbsp Im going to have to try this place out!  And by the way. . . If Ayn Reyes says its good. . .Then Im sold.  Right there that is a huge recommendation!   Users/AshleyHamidi

20120602 08:03:47 nbsp First hair cut with her and I was so happy with it! I have extremely long, thick, and coarse hair but she managed to make it feel light weight and silky smooth. She will work hard to make sure the outcome matches your expectations, and will fix it up some more if you want more layers etc. She really tries to please the customer and she does!!

20120801 19:51:24 nbsp Giselle is an exceptional stylist!
She took me from super long hair (over 16 inches) to the cutest pixie cut. I was bit nervous about the change, but after I saw what she did I loved it. I am very very happy with her work.
I love the new style she gave me and have received tons of complements on my new look. People have asked how I style my hair too look as good as it does, but honestly, I barely have to do anything to style/maintain my hair as the cut is so phenomenal!
Giselle is a super sweet person. She discussed many options with me before and throughout the process to make sure I was happy with the cut.  She worked closely with me, listening to what kind of style I wanted, while giving great guidance and suggestions from her professional perspective.  She worked efficiently, but at the same time took the time and effort needed to ensure a great cut. Finally, she styled my hair beautifully at the end.
If your looking for a new stylist, Giselle is your girl. I would defiantly recommend her to anyone looking for a cut. She can do anything from a simple trim (she trimmed and styled my friendâ€™s hair today and it also looks great!) to a completely new look. She is amazing! And I will definitely be going back to her again. Users/hipsandheartsxo

20130711 16:57:43 nbsp Giselle is a fabulous stylist, very friendly and efficient! I agree completely with (hipsandheartsxo)s comment. Giselle listened to my ideas, offered her own suggests when I asked and I ended up with a great haircut that requires no extra work at all. My first haircut was a great experience all around and so was my second! I will be back for my next! Users/ACA


20140604 23:07:20 nbsp hello daviswikiers! i just wanted to give a big thank you very much for being an amazing city and college town!!!! coming from the Bay Area...I was totally bored and confused with the calm of this city at first. I learned that Davis has the best schools and having two boys it was an honor to see them start their academic career in such a top notch school system! But now, almost 3 and half years later...i dread the fact that we are moving out of this wonderful bubble of calm and happiness and back into the crowds and drama. my husband moved us here so he can attend law school at UC Davis. He has since graduated and has recently landed a job in SoCal. bitter/sweet~ i started my craft here in this city! i landed my first ever salon job as Roxies assistant/the salon assistant fresh out of beauty school! then quickly worked my ass off to booth renting and literally had a sink or swim situation. luckily, i had the best salon, location, and the best coworkers/teachers/mentors that made sure i succeeded and did not sink... Roxie, Tricia, Marjan, Lisha and Tara... along all with the stylists who came and left YOU ALL taught me so much and put up with me all this time or for a time, thank you! But most importantly were all the lovely Davis students/people who tried me out and kept coming back to see little ol me! i truly appreciate each and everyone of you! i was able to support my family with your loyalty and business! what a great feeling to meet a perfect stranger only to earn their trust and bond with them as a person and call them my client! thanks again for letting me cut your hair and work my hair rituals on your beautiful selves! my hope is to make our way back! to call Davis home once more. Thanks for the memories...farewell.

sincerely,
giselle valk Users/giselleski
