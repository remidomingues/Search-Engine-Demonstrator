Glacier Circle Senior Community is the countrys first cooperative housing development for senior citizens. It consists of eight townhouses and a common house with a living room, communal dining area and a studio apartment for an onsite nurse. The development was planned and designed by the original twelve residents themselves, who began moving in December 2005. Many of the residents, though not all, are affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis.

For more information on the Cooperatives cooperative, there is background information on the http://www.abrahampaiss.com/ElderCohousing/GlacierCircle.htm planning process.
