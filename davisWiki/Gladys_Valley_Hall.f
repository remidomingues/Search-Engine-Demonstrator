The School of Veterinary Medicine 3A page has photos that have captured much of the construction of the Veterinary Medicine Instructional Facility.

Diners at Scrubs have watched the progress of both buildings. The concrete curved tiers that will form a lecture hall on the ground floor are visible.

The Memorials memorial for California Police Dogs entitled Faithful Partner is just north of the VMIF.

 Todays announcement was made in Gladys Valley Hall, the first building at UC Davis (and only the second in the University of California system) designed and built to achieve certification under the U.S. Green Building Councils LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. It is expected to use onethird less energy than a standard design, plus conserve water, provide better indoor air quality and incorporate natural materials. The building is a tangible example of the innovations that will be emphasized by the Energy Efficiency Center. Less energy is consumed for lighting by employing natural light, photo sensors and motion detectors. Natural ventilation, evaporative cooling and radiant floor slabs are used to reduce cooling energy.

 When construction is finished in June, Gladys Valley Hall will become the instructional heart of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine campus. The building is named for the late Gladys Valley in recognition of the longstanding generosity of the Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation.

The building was open and lectures began Fall of 06.
Theres also a computer lab of sorts on the 2nd floor. Restricted access to the vetschool.
