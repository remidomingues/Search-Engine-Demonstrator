Davis is not blurry. If you disagree, then you may need to find an Optometrists optometrist and get glasses. Or perhaps youve perfect vision but want to look like Harry Potter or Ted (one of the Fab Five). Or maybe youre collecting stigmas, and want to be called four eyes or goggle face. Whatever your motivation, glasses can be purchased without leaving the confines of Davis:

  Blackman & Guerrieri
  Busby & Suzuki
  Christine Chao OD carries a wide variety of designers
  EyeMax formerly Optical Phases
  Helmus & Helmus has frames and optometry
  Kaiser Permanente
  Medical Vision Technology carries 800+ designer frames

There are also a number of online retailers that sell glasses.  You need to get your prescription from your optometrist, and take some measurements on the glasses to make sure youre getting ones that are around the right size.  Theyre often much cheaper than optometrists, which are generally priced for people with vision insurance that will cover most of the costs.  Users/TomGarberson recommends coastal.com; you can often get free or halfoff frames, depending on the sale, and either free basic lenses or cheap upgraded lenses (composites, coatings, etc.).

If youre looking to ditch your spectacles, the PreOptometry Club on campus is collecting used eyeglasses to be sent to lower income areas of the world. Theres a collection box in front of one of the entrances to the MU, the one by the computer labs computer lab and Young Hall. However, the box is nowhere to be seen as of December, 2010. The Lion Club has a white collection box in the optometry department at Kaiser Permanente.
