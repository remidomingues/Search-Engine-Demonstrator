http://glennlangton.blogspot.com/ Glenn Langton graduated in 2009 with degrees in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering.  During his last years as an undergrad he lived with the amazing guys of 624 Villanova Drive.  He was frequently seen juggling or unicycling with members of the Damento Jugglers Damento juggling club, geocaching, or flying Cessnas at the University Airport.  Many of his days as an undergrad consisted of programing in 2121 Bainer Hall; more affectionately known as the CAE lab.  It has been rumored that he launches fire balloons into the night sky over Davis and enjoys freight hopping.  On a recent return visit to Davis he worked on the http://glennlangton.blogspot.com/2009/10/davisphotoprojectresults.html Davis Photo Project and led some explorers through the Davis storm drain system, entering at Hells Gate.
