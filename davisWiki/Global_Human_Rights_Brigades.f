Formerly known as Global Law Brigades, Human Rights Brigades was established in 2012 at UC Davis by Claire Callahan.
The Human Rights program aims to empower rural communities of Panama and the Darien Province of Panama to overcome obstacles that impede access to justice through legal counsel and educational workshops.  By mobilizing students student volunteer opportunities volunteers to connect with these communities on a familybyfamily basis, the team intends to develop a sustainable legal support system in the region to decrease the number of unresolved legal cases over time. Legal action in securing child support for a single mother and other domestic cases addressed in Human Rights Brigades will contribute to the economic stability of numerous families.

Case Work
Currently, the region suffers from a lack of familiarity of legal procedures, an overreliance on verbal agreements and poor record keeping; which result in a high number of unresolved legal cases in Global Brigades communities.

 Brigade
In order to mitigate the effects of these barriers to justice,  the Human Rights program has four main brigade activities: educational workshops and cultural exchanges alongside communitywide legal clinics and familyspecific case support.
These components respond to the communitiesÂ´ need for accessible legal resources, knowledge of legal procedure, and a bridge between customary practices and state legal procedure. By addressing these needs, the program will arm the communities with the tools to overcome barriers to access to justice and leave them with a culture of legal consciousness, and thereby contribute to decreasing the number of unresolved legal cases in the Provinces of Panama Este and Darien, Panama.
