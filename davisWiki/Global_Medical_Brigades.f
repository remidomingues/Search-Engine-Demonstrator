Global Medical Brigades a constituent of Global Brigades develops sustainable health initiatives and provides relief where there is limited access to medical services healthcare. Our current focus is in Honduras and Ghana where more than 4,000 annual students student volunteers and health professionals travel to establish mobile medical clinics in under resourced communities. Each community that we partner with receives a brigade every 3 to 4 months where hundreds of patients are treated and volunteer opportunities volunteers deliver public health workshops. Between brigades our incountry team maintains relationships with the communities to provide followup and conducts community health worker training to empower local leaders to perpetuate a consistent level of health care.

 Medications 
Global Medical Brigades works closely with local pharmacies, physicians, and other nonprofit organizations to collect donations. The group also fundraises and accepts monetary donations throughout the entire year to raise money for the purchase of medications.

 Brigades 


Medical Brigade volunteers have the opportunity to shadow licensed doctors in medical consultations and assist in a pharmacy under the direction of licensed pharmacists. Between brigades our incountry team maintains relationships with the communities to provide followup and to conduct Community Health Worker (CHW) trainings to empower local leaders to sustain a consistent level of healthcare. Electronic patient records are collected for future visitations and to monitor overall community health trends.

Volunteersâ€™ duties on brigades vary based on the medical background and skill of the volunteer. Volunteers with little to no medical experience have the opportunity to assist during the triage and intake of patients, shadow doctors during consultations, and help pack medications in the pharmacy under the direction of our on the ground pharmacist. Volunteers with greater medical experience have the opportunity to take a larger leadership role during triage and assisting with health education workshops, both under the supervision of licensed doctors. All patient consultations and medicine prescriptions are only done by licensed doctors. Regardless of medical skill level, there is a role for any type of volunteer and the chance to learn about providing sustainable healthcare to rural communities who would otherwise have limited access.
