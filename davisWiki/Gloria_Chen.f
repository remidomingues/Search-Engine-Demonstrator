ASUCD CRASH COURSE: ASUCD 101

ASUCD?!? Whats ASUCD?? Many students do not know what ASUCD is and what ASUCD does and I want to change that. ASUCD should play a purposeful and meaningful role in every students life and every student should know where a part of their tuition money is going. I want to implement a better outreach program that will interest all students and to create an ASUCD crash course that will educate students on what ASUCD does and of the opportunities ASUCD can provide them. Many students want to get involved on campus but dont really know how. This outreach program will help students find the resources they need to get involved and will help bring more diversity to the ASUCD table.

INCREASE TAMPONS/PADS AVAILABILITY AROUND CAMPUS

Periods are normal. Every woman gets them and as a woman, I know that sometimes our periods come and we just arent prepared. Were in dire need of a tampon and we scramble to the restroom only to find the tampon vending machine is broken. We ask around and find that none of our friends have any with them. I want to change those two scenarios so they dont happen anymore. I want to make pads and tampons more readily available on campus so that any woman who needs a tampon can attain one and can do so discreetly. I believe that women should have this resource readily available to them when they need it because periods happen and women shouldnt have to feel embarrassed of them.
