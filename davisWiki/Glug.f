Glug is probably Davis biggest and longest running metal band, with 6 consecutive years and hundreds of shows under their belt. Glug went on a long hiatus after playing a final show on July 7, 2007 at the G Street Pub. The band was resurrected from its unholy slumber in 2012.

They have a  Myspace website: http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseactionuser.viewprofile&friendID68741150 Glug
