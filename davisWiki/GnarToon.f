Shortly after Canseco broke up, Users/TeddyBriggs, Users/GonzaloEyzaguirre and Otis Caldwell still wanted to rock! The one word that describes this unique 3piece : YEAH. Sheer brilliance leaks from these guys, their heads..leaks from, their heads. They only practice the day of the show and smash your face into fun, dancable songs. Never giving you what you expect, these guys love to switch it up, you never know who will play what instrument for the next song!

Theyve played:
  Delta of Venus cafe on B street with the ZimZims and the Black Plastics
  The Pirate Ship various times
  Plainfield Station twice

Users/TeddyBriggs was also in Rooney, way back in the day.  He was also in the ZimZims.

Gnartoon plays rockin rizzle.

Sadly, they embodiment of coolgenius, Otis Caldwell, has moved to Iowa and thus ends the saga of Gnartoon. They were going to play their last show at 720 but the Police davisnoisepolice ruined the fun. Fortunately Anderson road in a convergent nexus of cool and the show was moved just down the road to the Pirate Ship.

Two of the three members of Gnartoon are now in Boss the Big Bit
