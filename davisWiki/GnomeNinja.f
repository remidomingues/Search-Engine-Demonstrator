Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Ninja, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  What is with all the flagging?  Wouldnt it be easier just to fix them as you go across them?  Otherwise, you might be interested in the list of All Pages outdated entries that I use.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

Hello JabberWok, it is such that I had this great feature idea, to have a flag entry button such that anyone could do it without the hassle of editing it themselves. While contrary to the wiki ideal, I have overheard many times that people were looking for some information that they lacked, and were unable to find it here, it was sad. So they didnt want to edit it (no information to contribute, and no information) but they knew something was out of date, and thusly I decided it would be a cool feature. As such I looked into the code and figured this way would work. I am not flagging entires but adding flag entry buttons. It is crude, and really hackish, but do you think it is a good idea?
Why the pseudonym, well because there should be a gnome ninja, I think that classrace combo should be allowed, high dex anyway. However it is more that I didnt want to fill up my edit history with this project. ~D
