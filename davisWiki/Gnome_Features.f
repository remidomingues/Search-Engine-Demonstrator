A part of Wiki Community/Future  the future planning process for DW/WS (i.e., both Davis Wikis needs and the interwiki needs of Wiki Spot).

This page is for everything minor that doesnt really belong in Wiki Community/Future/Software Features: ways for the highly involved users to find content that they need to fix.

Id like to see some sort of replacement for {{{Abandoned Pages}}}  finding the pages that havent been edited for a long, long time.   Users/BrentLaabs

 1. A ban system that doesnt suck. Id like to be able to do global account bans to fight spammers. Id also like the ability to globally ban IP addresses or a range of IP addresses. Automatically expiring bans with documentation for the ban reason could also be helpful.  Also, it would be handy to see all the edits that an IP address has made logged out like we can see all the edits that a user has made.
 1. The ability to move a page and all its files from one wiki to another as easily as we can rename pages on the wiki. We get a lot of stuff on the hub thats intended for other wikis.  Users/WilliamLewis

Theres a lot of fairly simple stuff that could be done with IP addresses.  Per some thoughts I posted on Wiki Community/Technical Discussion, Id love to see (1) IP address crossreferencing.  Have clickable IP addresses showing all editors to use an IP and all edits made.  (2) IP Address Lists in user info.  Just a quick list of IPs used by a given editor. Users/TomGarberson

  {{{include(wiki:somewhere:something)}}} and {{{wiki:somewhere:Something}}} that is dotted if it does not exist.

And expose an entry list for other sites and networks to do the same and reciprocate... (ahem).

1) Improved notification, both onscreen and via email.  (This is both a gnome feature and a Wiki Community/Future/Software Features software feature. 2) Ability to see change comments at the same time as the actual changes.   Users/CovertProfessor

1: IP address crosschecking / listing as mentioned by William and Tom.  Itd be a great tool to improve gnoming.  (Countless times Ive spent hours crosschecking user accounts...)
2: Improved notification visibility, as mentioned by CP.  Rather than a global change, could this come in the form of an include?  Such as Include(Attention).  When put on a user page, this would trigger an email to be sent to the account as well as a larger, more visible banner on the wiki page.  This would be far better than changing notifications for userpage edits, and would limit the amount of spam as itd only need to be used once.  Id imagine this would be a very helpful tool used by wiki regulars and gnomes than casual users.

   Okay, Im going to try to do something that may well fix this (notification visibility) later today.  It may be obnoxious at first, but well have a better situation within the next 12 hours, folks.  Anybody on later tonight (Monday, 20100510) willing to give feedback, let me know when you see me uploading CSS in Recent Changes.  I can only do CSS changes, but that should put us a good step toward an improved situation. jw

It would be neat to cross reference IP addresses to filter out sockpuppets.  The wiki could deny two user accounts using the same Ip address or automatically put the bla bla and bla bla2 share the same ip address disclaimer that we often see. Users/DagonJones
  Jason did something like this, I think.  I can see if he still has it. jw
