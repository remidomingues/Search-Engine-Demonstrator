Howdy Mr. or Ms. Aggie, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here, and most people use the name they go by on the rough and tumble streets of Davis.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the note about the change in management at Wake Forest Apartments.  I archived the old reviews prior to the change in management.  You can do that too  you can edit any page on the wiki just by clicking the Edit button.  Its your wiki (seriously  you literally own the content, along with everybody else!), so feel free to add your perspective to any page.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
