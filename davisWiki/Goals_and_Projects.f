Goals and Visions for the Davis Community Workshop
...or hackerspace, or whatever its called.  This section probably ought to be organized differently, but Im not sure how, so Ill leave it at bullet points.
  Id like to see a good mix of electronics space (especially a repository of components reclaimed from old gadgets), fabrication space (machine tools, welders, woodworking, etc.), and general workspace (for designing and coding and such). Users/DarinWick
   Id be curious to see a place for textiles as well, e.g. to be able to support wearable electronics. Users/BradenPellett
    This.  A sewing machine or two would be very useful.
  While I have nothing against the hackerspace being open to businesses, Im more excited about community projects, collaborative hacking, and education. Users/DarinWick
   Im very interested in a balance between personal and community projects, i.e. between projects that are for members of the space and those that are for the community as a whole.  Community projects would also be very good for outreach. Users/BradenPellett
  Ive always thought a shared space would be cool and would be interested in participating.  I would be particularly interested in a shared 3D printer. Users/jefftolentino
  Im very interested in the incidental collaborations between people of different skills and backgrounds that could occur in such a space, especially between the low and hightech worlds. Users/BradenPellett
  I wonder if the space could have modular areas, so that interesting but less used tools could be rolled out when needed, yet out of the way when not. Users/BradenPellett
   Since, as its been said, the space is likely to move a few times at the very least, making as much as possible modular/mobile is probably A Good Thing. Plus it makes the space reconfigurable for classes, special builds, parties, etc Users/sedberg
  I would be most interested in metal fabrication studio (with some kind of mill and lathe accessibility), followed by an electronics lab.  I think it should also have a free form area where anything could be done similar to what Braden is saying with a modular space.  A small computer cluster would also be nice (or an office space of some kind) with access to maker aiding software.  I envision each studio or space would also have studio appropriate storage plan maybe varying size lockers or cubbies of some sort.  Users/RobertMcMurry
  Field Trips  eg, to the http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/bmvc/ SF Bay Model, http://ironmanmuseum.com/?qcontent/tours Joshua Hendy Iron Works (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Hendy_Iron_Works also), ... Users/sedberg
  Joint memberships with other local organizations  eg, Explorit, Davis Astronomy Club, Craft Center, ... Users/sedberg
  Some sort of electronics/mechanical drop off point. This might not be logistically feasible, but if we could partner with a recycling organization, this might provide a ready source of old printers, CRTs, sewing machines, computers, whathaveyou that could be repaired for projects or scavenged for parts (servos, power capacitors, gears) Users/sedberg
     I agree.  Users/SteveDavison
  My vision is a shop with modern (CNC) tools for fabricating in metal, wood, plastic, and electronics. I need access to such tools in order to build my project ideas. It would have a CNC vertical mill (gantry router) for wood, a CNC vertical bed mill for metal machining, a brake (sheet metal bender), a sheer (sheet metal), a 3d plastic printer, etc. Ideally such a space would have welding equipment, wood table saw, soldering, test equipment, etc. It would also have a stockroom for materials (wood, metal, electronics, etc). Knowledge and skills are not my shortcoming I can solder, TIG weld, gas weld, blow glass, program assembly, Gcode, whatever, and can teach any of these skills. Users/SteveDavison

 Maker space census 
Does Davis have the population to support a maker space? Here are some major metropolitan areas and their http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Combined_Statistical_Areas populations:


What can you contribute?
Note that its probably best not to list expensive tools here, since its a public page.  Give your row a color to make the table more readable.

What projects would you like to work on?
Classes, workshops, software, hardware, lowtech, hightech...  anything!
