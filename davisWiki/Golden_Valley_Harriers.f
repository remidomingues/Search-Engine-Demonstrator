http://www.goldenvalleyharriers.org Golden Valley Harriers (GVH) is a running club that meets in downtown Davis.  They have workout runs every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. They also sponsor a Labor Day race, participate in the annual Tahoe Relays and support an aid station at the Western States 100 mile race. All runs start and finish from Fleet Feet at 615 2nd Street in Davis. The Tuesday night workout starts at 5:45pm and is geared towards developing speed.  Since the workout is usually on the track or short loop, it is actually good for beginners since you are less likely to get left behind.  Thursday night meets at 5:55 pm and is geared towards an easy tempo run of about 5  7 miles.  Saturday morning meets at 8 am with runners going from 7  10 miles.
