Greetings, fellow wikiers:

The purpose of this page is to provide a concise profile of, well, me, and to illustrate the nature of my life in general, allowing others to understand my position in this world and how it pertains to the decisions I make and the views I express.

About Me: To begin, I find it appropriate to include a few general facts about my life: I grew up in California, in the town of Pacific Grove, on the Monterey Bay; I study English literature and Education at UC Davis UCD; aside from my studies, I pursue a range of mental and physical activities, interests, and casual hobbies. Here is a list of some of my extracurriculars, and I am always enthusiastic to discuss any  just ask!

Activities and Interests: Swimming, judo, cycling, strength/conditioning, tennis and racket sports, skiing/snowboarding, running, soccer, ultimate (frisbee), hiking/backpacking and other outdoor adventures. Gourmet cooking and food science, music theory and practice (I play sax, clarinet, guitar, drums, and piano), literature and text of all type, nature and wildlife, math and hard science, discussion and debate, film and other motion picture (some t.v., etc.), art, technology, pop culture and fashion.

Dislikes: (I find it complimentary to the aforementioned information to include this section). I dislike the manifestation of hate, extremism, and ignorance/intolerance; senseless violence; people who jeopardize others safety or general wellbeing; harmful bacteria/viruses; disease and poor health; mosquitoes; unnecessary complexity.

Please feel free to discuss/comment on anything!

All Good Medicine.
