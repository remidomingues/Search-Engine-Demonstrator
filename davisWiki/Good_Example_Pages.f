I was just interviewed by the Aggie for a Freshman issue.  They want a short list of good entries.  Other than Freshman Guide (thanks Jason), what should I send them?  Im off to a meeting and will likely poke around myself in the next hour.  They want entries that illuminate Davis and would make sense for a Freshman to learn about Davis in.


  Sports  for people looking to join teams?
