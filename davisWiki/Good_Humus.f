Although Good Humus Farm is not in Davis, it is none the less an indispensable part of Davis. This is one of the farms our food comes from. The farm comprises 20 certified organic acres in an area called The Hungry Hollow in the Capay Valley. Good Humus has been growing and marketing organic vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers in the Sacramento Valley since 1976. They believe strongly in strengthening local communities and have given much to Davis.

Jeff and Annie Main are some of the original farmers and organizers of the Davis Farmers market, and can still be found there on Wednesdays and Saturdays every week.

Jeff and Annie came to Davis as students at UCD and lived in the Agrarian Effort Coop.

CSA
In 1993 good Humus started its Community Supported Agriculture program. This is essentially subscription produce delivered to drop off points in Davis. Good humus drops of at the Natural Food Works on 4th Street on Saturday and the Davis Waldorf School on North Sycamore on Saturdays. They also deliver to Woodland and Sacramento. Call the farm for more details.

Agricultural Easement
An agricultural easement is a legally binding way to ensure our farm remains a farm for generations to come.   from their website.

To make sure that the land that is now farmed by the Mains remains a farm in the future, Good Humus is partnering with the communities of Yolo to purchase the nonagricultural value of the land. This ensures that the land will remain in agricultural use in the future, supplying Yolo communities with food for generations to come.
