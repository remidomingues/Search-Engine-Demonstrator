Some guys are slow. So slow in fact, that they need saving at the last minute. If you find yourself in this predicament, it might be a good idea to select a couple of ideas from this list.

Make sure you clean the apartment and set the table with napkins, etc. End the evening with a romancecomedy DVD or movies.
  Call/IM your significant other a couple times during the day, just to let her know youre thinking of her.
