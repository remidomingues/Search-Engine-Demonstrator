20050615 00:27:18 nbsp My parents give a sht less about coming to Davis. But when they are here, I like to take them to Sophias, or Plutos. A good family trip could also be MU Bowling Alley bowling under the MU. Otherwise Im stumped. If you want you can come down to the AS Papers office and Ill show them that; its not very interesting. SS

20050615 00:38:54 nbsp Although theyve already had a UC Davis Tours campus tour, maybe you could take them to the Arboretum...  You could also just wander around Downtown and find a nice place to have lunch. Users/SummerSong

20050615 09:34:28 nbsp Take them to Ben & Jerrys Users/RobRoy

20050615 10:19:19 nbsp One idea I thought of: there are definitely interesting (and touristy places) in Sacramento that are worth visiting, e.g. Old Sacramento and the State Capitol. Users/KenBloom

20050615 10:33:42 nbsp If you feel like taking a senic drive, you could go up to one of the wineries north of Esparto.  RH Phillips is up there...  Its actually really pretty when youre driving through all the dry, golden farm land, and then crest a hill and drive down into a valley of lush, green vines.  They have acres and acres of vines, and free wine tasting. Users/SummerSong

20050615 12:32:49 nbsp My parents have enjoyed the John Natsoulas Art Gallery Natsoulas Gallery and the Pence Gallery, sitting in the train station on the corn cob bench, seeing the arboretum, the mu bowling alley, village bakery pizza, Plutos, Sogas and Symposium.  Users/JackHaskel

20050615 13:21:39 nbsp Sophias Users/GeorgeLewis

20050615 16:02:48 nbsp Sudwerks Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050616 08:41:49 nbsp Cafe Mediterranee cafe mediteranee, plumbshire inn, caffe italia, and eh  I dunno. Users/ChristopherMckenzie
   I think you mean Osteria Fasulo, not plumbshire inn which no longer exists.

20050616 11:32:22 nbsp Any suggestions for good things to see, rather than places to eat.  Users/KenBloom

20050616 13:32:58 nbsp You kinda have a wide range of ages to accommodate and we dont really know what theyve already seen on their campus tour, but since its raining out why not take them to some of our Museums and Exhibits? Users/AlphaDog

20050919 15:42:15 nbsp Perhaps Tucos Wine Market and Cafe if they like to drink? :) Users/MichaelGiardina

20060128 21:50:29 nbsp My mother has been here twice  Im not sure why she came again after the first time  and the only places we could think to take her were Ruby Tuesday and the Arboretum. But the fact that we have a toddler probably constrained our choices a bit. Ive heard the Jelly Belly Factory is cool, but not very close. Lake Berryessa is okay... Users/RoyWright

20080612 20:29:32 nbsp I thought maybe taking my Mom to one of the many very cool public pools. All parents are different, but my Mom likes to lay out and look hot, what can I say... Users/ahbrapeach

20080612 20:42:05 nbsp The Botanical Conservatory is a neat place to visit.  Its open to the public MF, just drop on by. Users/JonathanLawton
