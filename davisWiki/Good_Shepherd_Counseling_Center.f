When I first came to the Counseling Center I was laid off from teaching. Deep hurts in my childhood manifested in feelings of sadness, stress, difficulties in forgiving and forgetting, lack of trust of others and a pattern of getting stuck in codependent relationships.  As my emotional healing work with Art progressed I let go of many hurts and unhealthy relationships and patterns. My self esteem and inner stability has greatly improved and I am enjoying my teaching career more than ever. I am sure my family, friends, students and coworkers are enjoying the new me.

I encourage you to explore what counseling with Art can do for you. C.M  Vacaville

The counseling with Art has improved my life in so many ways.  When I started with him I was filled with anxiety, fear, self loathing, depression and stuck in a very unhealthy relationship.  I also suffered from compulsive eating and spending patterns.  Art very patiently worked at a pace I could handle.  He helped me face and let go of the subconscious root causes of my problems.   As a result I am off all antidepressants and antianxiety medications and I have lost weight.  Without effort, I feel much better about myself and I am married to someone that is positive and supportive.  My family and friends are amazed how I have changed.

My improved life is a testimony that Art is a skilled therapist in helping his clients resolve life long patterns of negative feelings, thoughts and behaviors. I encourage you to go to him for counseling.  N.R  Davis

I originally came to Art for counseling because of “family” issues. My marriage was in turmoil and one of my children was not where a mother would want her son to be. Yet, in the counseling process I began to realize that I was a part of the problem—a big part of the problem—because of the way I was thinking about God and myself.

Over the three or so years that I was in counseling with Art, I came to love and value myself to a much greater extent. I no longer judge and condemn myself as I used to; indeed I no longer am constantly focused on myself—if I am doing right or wrong. Instead I am free to see God as He really is—full of love for me and those around me.  As a result of this my actions now spring more from love rather than being born out of constant selfflagellation. Much of the stress and negativity is gone from my life and amazingly that is transferring to those around me—particularly my family.  M.A.   Davis

20120806 15:42:16 nbsp My time with Art was very beneficial. Woundings from past rejection and abandonment which had caused years of fear and anxiety were brought to light and healed. This resulted in a much more healthy selfimage and emotional freedom to be at peace with who I am. I highly recommend counselor Art.

Nothing in my life has provided more transformational growth than the inner healing I received from Art Defenderfer at the Good Shepherd Counseling Center.   Before coming to Art, I struggled with depression and low selfimage.  Now, after getting counseling from Art, I am overflowing with life and happiness and  my selfconfidence is off the charts!  Art’s counseling services have truly transformed my life!  I highly recommend the Good Shepherd Counseling Center to anyone seeking personal growth or therapy!

20140804 11:47:33 nbsp Recently I have wanted to share more about my therapy experience and just how much Arthur helped me find deeply positive change that is still alive and working in me.  I have posted here before but it was short and sweet, not really giving a scope of the life change that has happened since going to Good Shepard Counseling Center.  So, here is a little more of my testimony, thank you for reading!
My family and I had just moved to Davis when we had a family crisis that triggered almost every traumatic memory I had from a very early age.  Having 5 children and an onslaught of emotions I knew I needed to help.  Not knowing where to go I asked a family friend, also a therapist, if he could recommend someone in area and he wholeheartedly recommended Arthur. Due to the nature of our current crisis and the depth of my personal issues I felt nervous and skeptical when I first entered Good Shepard Counseling Center.  However, I was relieved when I met Arthur, as he was authentic and caring. When he talked with me it helped me to trust the process; in a short period of time I knew I had found the right therapist for my needs.  During the course of my counseling Arthur helped me work through a number of those traumatic memories and I am glad to report significant breakthroughs in the areas of emotional and physical health.  I am much more confident and am setting appropriate boundaries with my teenage daughters and others.  I am consistently communicating with others, who are frequently critical of me, in a positive (not over reactive) way. I thoroughly recommend Arthur Defenderfer, he is experienced, professional and a genuinely caring person.  M.S. ~ REDDING, CA
