 Davis Retail Store 


Goodwill in Davis is occupying the space where All Things Right and Relevant and the Wash Mill used to be.  The Wash Mill was forced to close in January 2013 when the landlord would not renew their lease because Goodwill wanted their space.  Some find it ironic that a company dedicated to helping lowerincome people would deprive East Davis of its only laundromat, given that many people walked to the Wash Mill.  The Vanguard wrote three articles on the subject.  (http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id5982:commentaryclosureoflaundromatstrainsworkingclassdavisandstudentpopulation&catid53:landuseopenspace&Itemid86 here, http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id5985:sundaycommentaryclosureoflaundromatembodiesplightoftheotherdavis&catid53:landuseopenspace&Itemid86 here, and http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id5990:goodwillbecomesthebadguyasresidentsdescribeimpactoflossoflaundryfacilities&catid53:landuseopenspace&Itemid86 here). The Davis Enterprise published http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinioncolumns/timetoairthedirtylaundry/ an editorial by Meg Sloss, in which she states, shame on you to the landlord of the Manor and the CEOs of the Goodwill. They both have given into greed and selfishness at the expense of their customers and another business owner.  Quite a few folks are planning to boycott this store.

The Goodwill Donation Location in the El Macero Shopping Center looks pretty dead every time I go by (twofour times a week to shop at Nugget); based on http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinioncolumns/timetoairthedirtylaundry/ an editorial by Meg Sloss and talking to the former owners of Wash Mill the day they received their eviction notice from Goodwill, Id recommend donating at ASPCA on Third Street instead http://www.yolospca.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewcategory&layoutblog&id51&Itemid76. Their website says they need donations, which wont fund demolition of a mom and pop laundromat!!  Users/BrianKenyon

West Sacramento
A new Goodwill opened in West Sacramento near the corner of Harbor and West Capital Ave.  Its got a TON of great stuff, but at Goodwill prices (those being set pricing that is more expensive than some thrift stores...for instance, all jeans are $4, all dresses are $5. This store is significantly larger than the one in Woodland and has a much better selection. It has tons of printers, appliances, sporting goods, etc.

There used to be a Goodwill in Woodland on Main Street, but it closed in 2014. Do not confuse the address with the Goodwill offices located at 120 West Main Street Users/TarZxf tz

20110619 10:40:44 nbsp This place is pretty great. I hit two birds with one stone by donating and getting rid of my ewaste when I moved (vs having to go to the landfill and another donation site). The girl working there was very nice and helped get all my stuff inside.  Users/equitonic

20130726 15:05:55 nbsp IIm voting with my dollars (or not, in this case) and havent shopped in this shopping center since finding out about the lease atrocity. Shame! I didnt use the laundromat but small business is being pushed aside all over. Pretty soon we wont have any small, interesting, independent shops. Sad. Users/KatyMartin

20131012 18:16:55 nbsp Oh my god, this place is soooooooooooo good for Halloween! They had tons of stuff! Extremely cheap costumes! Those costumes in a bag you normally get for $65 at a Halloween store? $20 here. They mix in the regular Goodwill clothes that could work for costumes in with the storebought stuff. TONS of things. Wigs. Masks. Makeup. Hats. I found corsets for $5 and $10 and leather jackets and pants ranging from $5 to $20. Really good deals and shopping hereespecially since we dont seem to have a Halloween store in Davis in 2013. Excellent haul! Users/JenniferRutherford

20140623 15:21:27 nbsp This is regarding the Davis location. The Woodland location was shut down months ago. The Davis location is a cluttered mess with outrageous prices and limited selection. The prices are comparable to what you would see at the nearby TJ Maxx or Target. Save your money and go to the other thrift stores in town or by new.  Users/nkristis
