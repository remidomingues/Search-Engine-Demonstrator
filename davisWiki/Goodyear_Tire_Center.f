20061215 09:26:10 nbsp Users/RyanCastellucci took his car in here for a tuneup, and it was done very quickly (23 hours).    They are very friendly and professional and their pricing seems fair. Users/AdrienneMcCarthy

20061226 10:42:05 nbsp I have had a frustrating run with tires having to get 3 new in 2 months (2 of which on new tires), and they have been very helpful and friendly throughout the entire process.  I recommend this place. Users/BenjaminRosenstein

20070609 18:36:55 nbsp Great place.  The people that work there are truly helpful.  The gentleman at the front door talked to my pa over the phone for a long time helping him understand the situation.  My tire got a nail in it (that couldnt be patched) and they really helped get me a good tire for a reasonable price. Users/heyitsdimo

20071107 14:11:28 nbsp As of today, they charge $42.50 to rotate and balance all four tires. Users/MattVanGundy

20080108 12:47:12 nbsp After having many fun experiences with University Honda, I now take my car to Goodyear and have always had quick and excellent service.  Users/ChrisThompson

20080119 10:37:47 nbsp Goodyear is the only place I take my car. They are extremely honest, professional, and friendly. I took my car in last year because I thought it was acting weird. They looked at it, took it for a test drive, and after finding nothing wrong with it, told me it was fine (but bring it back if it was acting up again) and didnt charge me a thing! They were able to give me my car back right away (within the day) even though they were very busy. They dont ripoff carignorant people like me, which is something not a lot of auto places can say.  Users/JoyChu

20080126 16:04:12 nbsp Thanks daviswiki! I chose Goodyear over Big O because of these comments and was not disappointed!  They were very nice, not condescending to carilliterates and took care of the leak in my tire really fast. Users/cdmarqua

20080204 02:05:48 nbsp thumbs up!

i bought a tire there before and they did an okay job. price was average and i thot they could have done a better job putting my spare back in the trunk. i also got my car back missing the caps for 2 of my tires. that was in august last year

THIS YEAR however, i went there because apparently i needed to replace one of my sensors because my tire pressure light wouldnt go off. infinity was about to charge me about 600 dollars including the diagnoses fee but i decided to stop by the tire center to see if there was something else i could do. this one guy that worked at goodyear checked all tire pressures and went thru the whole manual trying to fix the problem but wasnt very successful. i asked him for extra caps and he gave them to me happily and explained what i could do take care of the problem. he didnt charge me anything and as i drove off the lights turned off.

i highly recommend this place. tires may be a bit pricey compared to other cheap places but as far as quality goes, its definitely worth it paying the extra buck. service is great and i feel like they dont reap off carignorant people like me. Users/cobugi

20080205 22:50:50 nbsp Went here a couple years ago after experiencing some damage to a tire (chunk of the side got chewed off by curb while trying to maneuver in an IMPOSSIBLE San Francisco parking garage).  Thought I needed a new tire, which bummed me out since they were still very new.  The guy working at the time told me it was fine and he would be heartbroken, too, if it had to be replaced.  Told me to come back when I really needed new tires and hed help me out then.  I reeeeeeeally appreciated the honesty.  Im sure plenty of swindlers out there wouldve lied and sold me an unnecessary new tire. Users/EmilyBlake

20080211 15:12:52 nbsp Just got new tires last week (after writing my other comment) and can attest to their great customer care and service once again.  While I was waiting, a mother and her 2 kids were there to get a new tire since the old one was punctured with a screw.  The staff helping her informed her that it didnt cause significant damage and they got her all set to go again free of charge.  Theyre really great at that stuff  definitely makes people want to come back and give them business. Users/EmilyBlake

20080213 15:01:27 nbsp My wife and I have been taking our vehicles here for all our regular maintenance for the last few years, and weve always been very happy with their service and customer service. Users/BrianWilliams

20080306 09:22:35 nbsp I took my car in for an oil change back in August. I had paid extra for a special filter and oil and just recently I noticed that they did not put on the filter that I asked for and I am pretty sure that they didnt use the oil I asked for either. I called them to explain the situation and that since August I had put on less than 2000 miles on my car, and he said there was nothing he could do. Would not go there again, flatout highway robbery. Users/BrandonMinow

20080410 09:41:22 nbsp I have been to this shop numerous times with various tire problems, about half they time they fix the problem for free and the other half is reasonably priced and done the same day with good prices.  This place has won my business Users/ZepBrattesani

20080919 21:06:12 nbsp Theres no putting a price on the comfort I feel taking my car to Vander Hamm Tire Center. Im one of those carignorant customers who always had Dad or my husband competently monitor the service my cars got. Now that its just me, I trust the crew at this Goodyear Tire Center and theyve never let me down.

They calm the nervous Nelly in me when my car makes strange noises, never charging me for their labor when it turns out to be nothing wrong (I give them all my tire and routine service business.). They help me gauge whether or not its worth it to put needed service into my older car (Im trying to drive it as long as I can as long as I can do so safely.).

I always leave there knowing my car is safe to drive and that Ive paid a fair price for necessary service. Highly recommended by this customer of 10 years. Users/TwoCansMom

20080922 11:03:53 nbsp Ive been taking two cars (Mazda and Toyota) there for a few years.  Ive not felt I was ripped off or received a bad repair or service.  Their prices are neither cut rate nor exorbitant.  Its basically fair value: good work at a good price.  I did pay somewhat more for new tires there than at other places, but wanted to keep all my auto business at one place.  Ill keep going back. Users/RalphFinch

20090713 16:05:00 nbsp Got a set of four tires for my car today. They have many brands, and had a wide selection from $55/tire up to ~$100/tire for my particular car. After dropping off my car, they gave me a ride back to the UC D campus. They give free rotation / balance if you buy a set of tires as most tire places also do. Good people here. Users/ScottMiller

20091010 16:24:07 nbsp I had an amazing experience today.  I went in to get all four new tires, and got reasonable prices and great service.  They helped me out and answered my questions, with hardly any wait time.  I usually feel almost traumatized when leaving an autoshop, but for once I left with a pleasant feeling.  I most definitely recommend this place. Users/LisaD@UCD

20091203 15:30:36 nbsp Just had a 90,000 mile service performed for a super budget price.  Used all OEM parts and threw front brakes in for pennies.  Great job, and recommend them 100%. Users/donjumpsuit

20091204 13:24:38 nbsp Bad customer service not helpful at all. One of the workers was very rude to me and it seemed all he was trying to do was get money from me saying I have to leave my car there. Very shady in my opinion Users/jasonjiang

20091204 13:29:37 nbsp This place is way overpriced. Get your car fixed or tires replaced somewhere else. One of the workers was very rude and patrionizing Users/justinwinters

20101011 15:44:52 nbsp TERRIBLE service. Person was rude. Over charged, treated me like a child. Would definitely recommend another place. The good reviews seem to be from 2 years ago. Perhaps their service went down from there.  Users/sophiaxtai

20101121 10:54:46 nbsp Had to get a new starter for the car because the original from 19 years ago was giving out. They were really efficient and helpful. Took the car in in the morning, it was done same day. Users/AndjelkaGojkovich

20110308 18:08:18 nbsp Friendly, polite, efficient service. Bought tires here last year after checking around and discovering that they had the best deal for what I wanted, and which included lifetime free rotation. Nice guys. Users/Swilltopower

20110309 03:13:47 nbsp This is a great place to go for car repairs and maintenance, and they have a decent selection of products for your perusal and purchase as well. I have taken my car here several times, and had a fairly complicated A/C problem completely diagnosed and fixed in a timely and professional manner, for a very reasonable price. The guy who operated the front desk when I have gone is friendly, patient and knowledgeable. He was very up front about what would be done, the services required, and the fees that would be required. Highly recommend this place, esp. if youre not looking to pay dealer prices. Users/IanBurau

20110323 16:53:47 nbsp Ive long been a skeptic of Goodyear and Firestone repair centers.  Im happy to say that Ive been proven wrong.  Goodyear Tire Center was able to fix both a nasty vibration and a slow leak at a very reasonable cost.  Great job, great price. Users/JimStewart

20110601 21:37:43 nbsp A little late I must admit, but I just found out about Daviswiki.org and how to post on it ! In this family, I do pretty much all the work on our cars and motorcycles. Some years back ( 2004, I know it is way back, I told you ! ), I wasnt around when my wifes Suzuki car needed an oil change. She brought the car to the place her mom had been going for years. About 2000 miles later, I checked the car over : There was NO OIL on the dipstick. I did an oil change and found out that the little oil left in the engine was so black and water like in its thickness, the oil filter was over sized, did not cover the full engine mating flange and of course there was oil all over the outside of the engine. Most of all, the fellow who actually did the work wrote in the maintenance manual booklet and in the invoice that he put 3.5 quarts of new oil in the engine....when the manufacturer ask for 5 quarts !
This was a perfect Japanese engine with only 70,000 miles on it. It had never used oil before.
Since then, that car has still been very reliable, because of the extra care I provided. It just takes 1 full quart of oil between oil changes !
What happened is that with a below substandard oil job, the engine was deprived of the right amount of oil for its cooling and lubrification. With the wrong oil filter, oil even sipped out of the engine. It is a true miracle of Suzuki engineering that this engine didnt seized.
Basically, after going through the hands and care of the Goodyear Tire Center, that car in 2000 miles suffered the wear of 250,000 miles.
It has been a long time. But every time I need to work on this car, I am reminded of what they did.
My advice if you ever get work done here : check every bolt, oil level, parts installed, before you leave their premises..... Users/ThierryWillefert

20110604 15:31:40 nbsp Great service, helpful, and friendly! Im glad I brought my Passat here to get a second opinion. There is also a helpful online coupon if you get all 4 tires replaced.  Users/EmilyHughes

20111024 20:28:31 nbsp Took my 01 Corolla to them to check a bad noise from the front brakes today.  They promptly called back with an estimate and explanation of what was needed. The price was reasonable and the job was done less than three hours from when the car was dropped off.  Very happy with the service and I will return. Users/LisaBriggs

20120504 09:16:36 nbsp I highly recommend these guys.  Ive taken my car here three times now, and each time Ive been treated with courtesy and respect.  They have very fast service( my car was ready an hour or so earlier than the estimated time the last time I took it in) and their prices are fair.  I will always take my car here first whenever I can. Users/HeatherNicholoff

20120616 00:13:21 nbsp Fast friendly service.  We had to get a tire replaced.  We called around EVERYWHERE and the prices here were competitive or better than anywhere else.  No need to go to CostCo or Woodland, just keep your business local.  We would definitely recommend this place. Users/KileyA

20120628 20:39:01 nbsp Great place. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. Fast and reliable service, reasonable price. Went there a couple of times, and never have anything to complain about. Went to get my breaks replaced/fixed today, and it was done within a few hours (including the time it took for them to order the parts). Danny was extremely helpful. Users/xgen

20120709 10:04:39 nbsp I am sad that I have moved out of Davis, because it puts me out of range of this great shop.  Ive bought two sets of tires here and never had any complaints  theyll rotate them for free, which I have them do when I get my oil changed.  Ive also had brake work done here, and they gave me a good price.
(I came here today to look for their number, on the offchance Blaine could recommend a good shop in my new location.)  If the timing lines up, I will have my car serviced here in future when Im visiting town.  Yep, theyve made me that happy! Users/RobertLinehan

20120718 09:54:44 nbsp Thanks Rich and Blaine for a very pleasant experience! I had to get my truck tires replaced and also get a spare wheel. Rich was friendly and he did not try to make me buy the most expensive tires. While they have all kinds of tires, they didnt have a wheel for my spare, and so Rich had to order it from the Ron DuPratt, which took an extra day. After getting the spare wheel, we realized that my truck didnt have a special Ford nut and so they were not able to put the spare onto the rack under the bed. They seemed apologetic about it even though it wasnt their fault. When they gave me the truck back, Blaine actually spent about 15 minutes explaining to me how the spare tire rack on this particular truck works, which is something I had no clue about. At one point, he was on the floor pointing at stuff under the truck. He also gave me tips on how to change tires on this truck, such as using a hydraulic floor jack instead of the rather unstable scissors jack and jacking up the truck from the axle rather than from the frame.  Users/EdLim

20121126 20:05:16 nbsp Excellent and quick service.  I had a flat and brought my car up for them to check on.  I was expecting the run around with a recommendation to replace all 4 tires.  Instead they pulled tire off, did a leak check and confirmed there was no problem.  Sent me on way with no charge.  Really appreciated the trustworthy service, will use them in the future for any help I need. Users/shraken

20121215 17:32:31 nbsp Got the rear tires changed for my car within 15 min total..10 min past the time of their closure...great service....friendly staff....cheapest price (I got quote from four different places in Davis)... Users/saikatdutta

20130224 13:23:42 nbsp Best customer service EVER!!!  Ive been a customer here for the last 5 years  I take my car here for everything except smog checks.  Ive had tires put on twice and other small items fixed along the way.  The work itself has always been great and the prices are reasonable.

On to their customer service  Blaine is fantastic.  He always explains the problem and all my options in a very polite way.  As a women who knows nothing about cars I really appreciate this.  Everyone else there is also always so respectful, they keep your car clean while they work on it, and generally have great attitudes.

This weekend I got a flat tire and was panicked about getting it fixed in time to meet other commitments Id made.  Blaine and Rich was SO helpful.  I showed up at 7am on a Saturday morning and they had me on the road by 8:15am.  AMAZING.  Especially because they didnt have the exact tire in stock so had to make a special trip to Sacramento!

Bottom line, if you want a lowstress, highquality experience this is definitely the place to go.   Users/daviscagradstudent

20130517 09:28:53 nbsp Ive been bringing my car to Goodyear for decades now. They have always provided excellent service. They are one of the few places I trust not to sell me anything my car doesnt really need. They have gone above and beyond keeping my car running for 18 years now. When a climate control computer developed a flakey vacuum solenoid and the part simply wasnt available anywhere, they cobbled together a manual switch so that I could still use the A/C. I dont think any other place could have done that for me. Users/JosephSenecal

20130906 12:10:12 nbsp Without a doubt the most positive experience I have ever had with a mechanicNot just tires. Charged me absolutely nothing for a diagnosis even though they had to ship a part to one of their collaborators across the country. They actually took a loss to pay for shipping and charged me nothing for labor, because they werent able to fix my car (it has a problem that only the Ford Dealership can fix). The mechanic I worked with, Rich, was very friendly, helpful, and communicable through the whole process. Thanks GoodyearCustomer for life!!
