Google Fiber for Communities is Googles upcoming http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/public/overview experimental introduction of ultra high speed internet. They plan to offer connection speeds of 1 Gigabit per second to a handful of communities around the country. Thats over 100 times faster than our current high speed options in Davis! If youre interested in helping to make Davis be one of these lucky communities, then youre in the right place. Community leaders are already working on their half of the nomination process and now its time for us community members to do our part. We need to act quickly because the March 26th deadline is coming up on Friday!  Please direct your friends to the nomination page (see below) and help them to nominate Davis. Davis Community Network also has http://www2.dcn.org/dcn/an/20100225 more information.

 Kansas City Wins 
On April 30th, 2011, Google http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/30/googlesgigabitfibernetworktobebuiltinkansascitykansa/ announced that Kansas City, Kansas City had won the contest.  Google will apparently be expanding the project to other cities in the future.


 How we did 
 Google received > 1100 community responses (RFPs from governments) and > 194,000 responses from individuals.  Of those, there are only a few cities in the country that had more than 1000 responses in the community.  See http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/nextstepsforourexperimentalfiber.html this page.  Large dots on the http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/S61Qq_70GTI/AAAAAAAAFw0/f7lIQRl4GUQ/s1600/a1k.png map show communities that submitted > 1000 responses.  Davis appears to be one of those few, and has a much smaller population than most of the others.  Congratulations, Davis!

On October 21st, 2010, it was http://thehill.com/blogs/hilliconvalley/technology/125205googletestinghighspeedfibernetworkatstanford announced that Google will first test their fiber network near Stanford University. Initially the new fiber network will serve 850 faculty and staffowned homes on campus. Product manager James Kelly said Google will learn from the small deployment how to scale the Google Fiber program effectively for larger communities. The goal is to provide fiber connections to between 50,000 and a halfmillion people. Communities will be selected before the end of the year.  Kelly said Stanford was selected because of its openness to experimenting with new fiber technologies, the neighborhoods layout and the small number of homes. The location just a few miles away from Google will also make it easier for engineers to monitor progress.



 How this benefits YOU 
Remember when everyone connected to the Internet using slow dialup modems?  Web pages downloaded very slowly.  Downloading a single program could take hours.  Most applications that we run today, such as networked games, high definition video, and audio streams were simply not feasible back then.  The typical network connection today is about 3570 times faster than dialup.  Now imagine a connection 200 times faster than what you have now.  New applications that are simply not feasible now will become part of the everyday world.  New types of businesses will develop around the network as well.  This is the future, sooner.

 Reasons Why Davis is an Ideal Candidate 
This might give you a starting point for when you submit your nomination (theres a question which asks Why should Google build a fiber to the home network where you live?).
    Davis has already done a great job of utilizing the internet in creative ways. Davis Wiki has been called the worlds best local wiki for obvious reasons and the http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Community_Network Davis Community Network has been dedicated to using Internet resources to build local and regional community for 17 years. Google explicitly states that theyre interested in seeing what sort of creative ways communities can come up with to take advantage of higher speed internet access. We have a great track record which will only get better if Google decided to bring ultra high speed internet to Davis.  We also have a UC system research university with many people who could develop applications that would take advantage of the fast connection.
    Were creative in other ways too! Davis has a reputation for creativity and this certainly the sort of thing that Google is looking for. We have a history of innovation and community betterment that goes far beyond Davis Wiki. Another clear instance of this is our pioneering introduction of bike lanes and bike lights which have served as an example for cities around the world for many years. We have artists who could explore sharing media in new and exciting ways with higher speed internet and we have more scientific types who can experiment with new internet technologies and start ups in their own way.
    Davis is the perfect size for what Google is looking for. Although other cities like Seattle and St Louis are also making bids for this internet access, but theyre much larger than what Google is looking for. They say that they would like to offer it to several communities and to a total of somewhere between 50,000 and 500,000 people. With a population of roughly 65,000 people Davis sits at just about the right size to be one of the several trial communities.
    Davis has a tech savvy and educated population that would be particularly well suited to take advantage of this opportunity. In 2006 Davis was ranked the second most educated city in the United States by http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/top25s/educated.html CNN Money Magazine.
   Low competition and poor service in the current Davis market, coupled with an educated and internet savvy population provides a large base interested in trying new options.
   Davis is an easy day trip away from Googles main campus by mass transit train or highway, allowing Google researchers to easily observe the changes locally as the project progresses.
   Davis has a huge collection (per capita at least) of Open Source coders that have good experience setting up highly popular software components and websites.



 Proposed Uses of the High Speed Internet  
Here some preliminary ideas for how the high speed internet could be used in Davis.
    Science
       High resolution medical data could be shared in real time between the UCDMC, Sutter Davis, the med school, the vet school, etc.
       UC Davis participates in a number of cutting edge physics experiments which involve unprecedented amounts of information generation.  Several labs here are working on experiments at the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider Large Hadron Collider in CERN.  An estimated 30 terabytes of data may be generated in 24 hours http://uanews.org/node/12956.  The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is being led by our very own UC Davis professor Anthony Tyson and will also produce roughly 30 terabytes of data in a single day (interestingly, Google is actually working with the LSST experiment to make night sky maps available to the public!).
       The necessity of sharing data in scientific collaborations has historically played a huge role in the evolution of internet technologies; the world wide web itself was even invented by physicists at CERN for the purpose of information exchange! As both the size of scientific collaborations and the amount of data products grow they continue to push the boundaries of what current technologies allow for.
       Having higher speed internet would facilitate the research of a wide range of research groups at UC Davis and could potentially lead to innovations in the way that data is redundantly stored and analyzed.  The trends which evolve within our community might eventually become the norm as internet bandwidth increases for an increasing number of people.
    Streaming Media
       A program could be initiated to make high quality streaming videos of UC Davis lectures available online.
       Dance, theater, or music performances could be streamed in high fidelity.
       Transmission of high quality video lectures (from a major research university), television (including existing community television) and movies without involving the cable companies
       Greater video and GIS functionality for Daviswiki and other local websites.
    Open access WiFi blanketing the city (with that much bandwidth, it doesnt matter if you share some).  This could greatly expand the use of mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad and Android powered devices.  It would also empower the student population in desperate need of more connectivity for studying.
    Distributed, redundant data systems possessing community content could be facilitatedhttp://www.davisenterprise.com/story.php?id631.0
    Voice over IP everywhere
    Collaborative projects between the UCD campus and industry where very high speed data links are required
    Make Davis a hub for network based businesses
    Experimental environment for new ideas and technologies surrounding mobile devices (see open access WiFi idea).
    Better mapping capabilities for Bike/Pedestrian routes throughout town with video of the route integrated... Safe Routes to Schools, Errands via Bike route generator, Wildlife/Open Space tours etc.
    Video coverage of all City Commissions, public meetings etc
    Video tutorials and interactive virtual bicycle repair workshops with Davis Bike Collective
