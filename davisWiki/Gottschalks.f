Gottschalks is like a mini version of Macys. Not the place to buy stuff if youre poor^1^. Its right next to Cost Plus World Market, which is where Harvest Market used to be. The Fresnobased department store was established in 1904. The Davis store opened around the year 2000.

They filed bankruptcy in January 2009, and shortly afterward, Gottschalks was http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE52U0TR20090331 sold to liquidators and all of the stores prepared to close. Their going out of business sales began in April 2009. Gottschalks closed its Davis store June 30, 2009.

You often saw people walking around here as they waited for their food to be cooked at the Old Teahouse or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.

They had a decent selection of basic items, but they were not big enough to replace the need to go to http://www.macys.com Macys or http://www.nordstrom.com Nordstrom in Sacramento for people who like that kind of a thing. For guys, it was a good place to buy a quick set of dress clothes. They did sell underwear and socks here, though.

1. With the exception of Thrift Stores it was probably the least expensive place to buy clothing stores clothing in Davis. However the clearance rack at Gap The GAP is also full of valuepriced merchandise that probably was never in the regular stock in the first place.

2. It was worthwhile to pay attention to discounts at Gottschalks, as something was almost always on sale. If you thought there might be an applicable coupon all you had to do was ask the cashier. Theyd give you the discount regardless of whether or not you brought in a coupon. Users/EyadDarras

Forever 21 signed a lease for this location and opened a brand new store in the former Gottschalks space.

This location was previously a Payless Drug Store.

20070728 21:10:21 nbsp Could we have any worse luck?? Why are we stuck with a Gottschalks of all shopping centers? Im not a big dept. store person but this place is really bad. Youd think Davis residents would start demanding a better wannabe Macys since we have so few places to buy clothes, etc. Everything Ive ever bought here has fallen apart.   Users/GradStudent06

20090125 19:37:22 nbsp So now that Gottschalks is going out of business and were gonna have a Target soon to take care of all our apparel needs, can we put a Trader Joes where Gottschalks is now? Isnt that the perfect solution to all of Daviss problems? Users/OscarSabino

20090331 01:52:56 nbsp The chain is apparently going to be liquidated.  However, a potential buyer from China may have emerged.  Purchase by another entity might save the chain.

20090331 09:27:17 nbsp Maybe a grocery store will occupy that space again at some point in the future, as Safeway used to be?  A grocery store near there would be much more convenient for people in that part of Davis than a discount clothing store, unless of course, they find that they run out of fresh discount clothing on a weekly basis... Users/IDoNotExist
  See OscarSabinos comment above.  It should be made to happen.
  But itd compete with the food coop and if I wanted a trader joes Id have moved to sacramento by now (but obviously I dont. and I dont think I am the only one in davis who thinks this way) Users/il
  Well an alternative then would be to build vertically on the spot and invite a multistory Super WalMart to move in.
   Thatd be wiki:chico:Chico Natural Foods vs Trader Joes all over again!  Interestingly, CNF said that they thought their store catered to a different demographic.  But Im not so certain about that.  Theyre surviving but it helps that Chicos Trade Joes is on the other side of town.  Interesting in any case and if I recall correctly already debated over on related pages here on Davis Wiki. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090331 16:03:29 nbsp Shops like Trader Joes do cater to a different demographic.  While I dont know what Trader Joes targets per se, Whole Foods (which seems like it targets a similar demographic) places its stores in neighborhoods with a median income of over $50,000.  The stores in Davis are largely those that target a student demographic, which generally doesnt have as much disposable income. Users/IDoNotExist
  The prices at Trader Joes are often surprisingly good, and sometimes cheaper than what youd find in a regular supermarket.  They negotiate deals with companies to sell products under the Trader Joes label for a cheaper price.  I imagine that they might very well compete with the Coop, though I cant say for sure.  I do think that students who live across from the U Mall would find lots of good buys there, if it were to move in.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Trader Joes stores are notoriously small. They are much smaller than a regular supermarket. It is sort of drug store sized. They have a variety of specialty foods, but their weakness is produce. They have a small selection of produce, but a lot of it is packaged in plastic. It is not exactly the freshest and all of the plastic is wasteful.   Users/MaxLucas
   Agreed.  I seldom buy produce there.  Users/CovertProfessor

20090430 17:22:23 nbsp Anyone know what the store is currently marked down at? Users/ChristineLim
  I was just there yesterday. Almost everything is 30% off, but there are a couple of things at 60%. And a lot of the most popular sizes of certain items are already sold out.
  The ads on TV this morning said 3070% off and listed many different items at 40% off (I dont remember all the details, but it was a lot of the clothes and housewares).  I worked for a department store that went through this about six years ago  wiki:wikipedia:Troutmans Emporium  and I can say from my experience the prices will not get really low until right before they close permanently.  The highest percentage, in this case currently 70% off, is usually only offered on the extremely out of season merchandise that would normally be offered at such a low price this time of year for normal clearance sales.  Liquidators are in the business of making money, not giving consumers good prices, and they will charge as much as possible as long as possible.  The going out of business sales are a bit misleading for the savings people think they are getting, in my experience. Users/StaceyEllis
