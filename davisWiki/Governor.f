The current Governor of the state of California is Jerry Brown.  The previous governor was Arnold Schwarzenegger.


In 2010, the Mondavi Center hosted the Whitman Brown Debate, one of three debates (limited to the two majority parties) between the 2010 candidates for Governor.  On November 2nd of that year, Jerry Brown was elected to a third term as governor, 28 years after his last time in that office. This was possible because his previous terms fell before termlimit laws were created, and those laws were not retroactive.
