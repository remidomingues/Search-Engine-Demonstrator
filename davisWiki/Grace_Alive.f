On the surface Grace Valley is a wonderful place:  closeknit community, good teaching, many wonderful activities for families and singles.  Unfortunately, all is not as it seems.  Beneath the surface lies a pattern of Grace Valley Christian Center/Allegations public humiliation of individuals by the leadership as well as the leaderships adherence to an abusive form of http://www.reveal.org/library/thirdparty/wellspring_otherside.html control which ultimately robs individuals of their liberty in Christ.

20091224 12:24:31 nbsp Grace Alive is Excellent place for young college students. when i was attending UCD Greg perry was my college pastor. I love his preaching and his message. But I hate The Pastor of the Church, He thinks he is the main hero and the main show...he never greeted anyone and left the church. When he preach, i always saw the pride that he had. Rebuking members infront of people..what is that.He thinks his church is the only best church in davis...i am going to pray  for him..but other than that..I love GRACE ALIVE and GREG PERRY GREAT MINISTER OF GOD..
