Grace Garden raises vegetables and fruits to help feed the less fortunate and hungry of our community.  Ninety percent of our harvest is donated to Fridayâ€™s Harvest, a weekly giveaway at Davis Korean Church and to Davis Community Meals.  In 2013 we harvested over 1655 pounds of vegetables and fruits.  We start all our own seeds in the hoop house.

Each year we have two fundraisers, the Annual Plant Sale and a fall calendar sale.  We have Master Gardener classes in the winter, spring and fall.

Mission statement:  Grace Garden is a faith based ministry of Davis United Methodist Church created to feed the hungry and educate the community about gardening, the environment and sustainable practices through teaching and outreach.  We grow community which nourishes the body and spirit.

Workdays are Monday & Saturday 810 am, Thursday 6:308:30 pm.
