20070807 22:29:36 nbsp Does anyone know anything about Grace Properties?  At the end of the househunting season, Im surprised no one has commented. Users/PaulWilburn

20071202 10:36:54 nbsp Its pretty small.  Grace has only been open since 2005, and I dont think Lois manages more than 20 or so houses.
I spoke with her recently.  She seemed nice enough. Users/BreaGerey

20080410 18:22:18 nbsp Grace is really nice and is responsive to things whenever you need her.  Ive been really happy with her so far. Users/dianamin

20080622 22:21:26 nbsp Lois has managed properties for me for years (even before she started her own business).  In my experience shes an outstanding property manager that has often gone well above the call of duty.  Shes capable, reliable, dedicated and operates with a high degree of integrity.   Users/AnthonyR

20090521 15:36:42 nbsp Lois really knows her stuff; shes on top of things, easy to get a hold of, and takes care of things quickly. Shes friendly and easy to talk to, and Im looking forward to having her as a landlady. :)  Users/mday24

20090810 20:46:51 nbsp Horrible, and will juice you for every dime you have. Users/TranN

20091220 13:27:42 nbsp WHEN A FRATERNITY MOVES INTO A HOUSE AND DESTROYS THE PROPERTY THEN THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO HOLD THOSE YOUNG MEN ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.  THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GRACE PROPERTIES, YOU WILL FIND THAT WITH ANYBODY.   Users/GRACEPROPERTIES

20111019 14:01:48 nbsp I had a very bad experience with this company. If you are a property owner you will not be disappointed, but if you are renting prepare for the worst.  Users/Schumtz

20130213 03:47:50 nbsp I would take those last couple of comments with a grain of salt... Lois was my property manager from 0910 while I was a student at UC Davis and she was fantastic. She was very approachable, helpful and extremely quick with fixing anything wrong with the house. We were responsible, respectful renters and we had no problems. Users/Ashley11
