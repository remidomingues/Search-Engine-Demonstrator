Grace Valley Christian Center is one of several West Davis churches.

 Mission Statement 

    Our congregation is committed to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the inerrancy and the infallibility of the Holy Scriptures. We are a body committed to living out the call that God has placed upon our lives to be his holy people. As those who have been called out of this world into Gods kingdom, we are being built into a community that loves one another and practices Gods word. We are regularly encouraged by the rich biblical teaching we receive and by the life we experience here. We believe in the solas of the Reformed tradition (wiki:WikiPedia:Sola_gratia sola gratia, wiki:WikiPedia:Sola_fide sola fide, solo Christo, and sola Scriptura) and are in fellowship with Christian Brethren assemblies throughout the world.

 History 

Originally from India, Reverend P. G. Mathew first came to Davis in 1973 to teach Greek and theology at then St Justins Theological Seminary.  In May 1974 the church was formed as Davis Evangelical Church and met in Rev. Mathews Cranbrook Apartments Cranbrook Court apartment.  In July services were moved to 345 L Street.  From November 1976 to May 1987 services were held at Lutheran Church of the Incarnation at 1701 Russell Boulevard.  In May 1987 the church moved to its present location at 27173 County Road 98 and the name changed to Grace Valley Christian Center.

  http://www.tdlgv.org/team/ Team Donate Life Grace Valley  June 2007 eight cyclists and ten support team members from Grace Valley participated in the http://www.teamdonatelife.com/index.php Team Donate Life http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/ Race Across America effort.  Their mission:  to educate the public regarding the lifesaving benefits of organ donation while raising funds toward continued transplant research.  Over six days team members rode 24 hours a day to cover the 3,000 miles from Oceanside, California to Atlantic City, New Jersey.   In the process they raised over 53,000 dollars.  Part of the inspiration for their journey was http://www.tdlgv.org/donate/ Joan Robys donation of a kidney to Simeon Trotter, both members of Grace Valley.  Joan was a crew member for the 2007 team.  Read more about their adventures on their http://www.tdlgv.org/log/ Team Donate Life Grace Valley Blog.

  Faith and Reason Series Lectures  In recent years, Grace Valley Christian Center has been holding lectures under what they call the Faith and Reason Series. Some transcripts and audio files of these lectures are http://gracevalley.org/Faith_and_Reason_Speaker_Series.html available on the GVCC website. The lectures question the theory of evolution and present the Gospel.  Invited speakers include wiki:WikiPedia:William_A._Dembski William Dembski (2004), wiki:WikiPedia:Michael_Behe Michael Behe (2005), or wiki:WikiPedia:Phillip_E._Johnson Phillip E. Johnson (2006) (http://www.inoculatedmind.com/?p147 interview), who then give two lectures on Intelligent Design, one on campus and one at the church.  The student club affiliate of GVCC, Grace Alive, hosts the first lecture on a Friday night, usually in 194 Chemistry.  The Friday night speech is generally devoid of overt religious content (although the lectures begin with prayer).  Then on the following Saturday morning they give the second lecture at the church, which includes religious content. The lectures are about an hour or so long, and are followed by a period for questions lasting about ten minutes.  For more information on Intelligent Design, please visit wiki:WikiPedia:Intelligent_Design the Wikipedia page.

 Experiences and Controversy 
GVCC is surrounded by controversy and a wide range of experiences. It is a closeknit community, but there are some allegations of emotional and spiritual abuse.  Go to the /Experiences Experiences page for more information. For a detailed description of the alleged aberrations at Grace Valley Christian Center, see /Allegations Allegations and Recovering From Spiritual Abuse.

 2012 Lawsuit 

GVCC has been named as a defendant in a child molestation lawsuit.  The lawsuit alleges that the accused was introduced to, gained access to, and was able to sexually molest and abuse each plaintiff because of and arising out of the relationship of the parties at and fellow membership in the Grace Valley Christian Center, and that Grace Valley Christian Center was further negligent in failing to warn plaintiffs, their families, and each of them, of the propensity of the accused to commit sexual abuse upon minor boys, a propensity of which Grace Valley Christian Center had actual and constructive notice.

See this Davis Enterprise http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/childmolestsuspectalsofacescivillawsuit/ article for more details.  At the time the article was written (which was before GVCC had been served with the lawsuit), GVCCs only response was, Weâ€™re still dumbfounded that were named in any lawsuit since none of the alleged incidents involved church leaders, took place on church property, or during church activities.

This lawsuit has since been dropped by the plaintiff.

20071024 15:47:46 nbsp On the surface Grace Valley is a wonderful place:  closeknit community, good teaching, many wonderful activities for families and singles.  Unfortunately, all is not as it seems.  Beneath the surface lies a pattern of Grace Valley Christian Center/Allegations public humiliation of individuals by the leadership as well as the leaderships adherence to an abusive form of http://www.reveal.org/library/thirdparty/wellspring_otherside.html control which ultimately robs individuals of their liberty in Christ. Grace Valley Christian Center/Experiences Take heed! Users/RichLindvall

20110113 06:04:18 nbsp This place is really scary, I strongly advise not getting involved here. Its all kinds of shady.  Users/KBathory

20110418 21:35:40 nbsp While considering a return to church rather than private faith I viewed many potential houses. GVCC was one such house and, upon reading all the details surrounding this church I find myself appalled. It has never been my experience to find an organization surrounded by such controversy. For such a bible based house, they seem to pick and choose which portions of the text to adhere to, tossing out the rest to suit their own purposes, ridicule and admonish publicly any who come to them in privacy or any who speak out against them and they truly seem to live against the beliefs they claim to teach. I feel sorry for the elders of this facility and wish that they might find the true path to the Lord. Users/WesP

20110418 22:41:09 nbsp I am going to check this place out. With everything that has happened with churches in Davis, I dont think things could get any worse. So I might as well. I will try to go in with an open mind and report back what I see. Users/Dozer
