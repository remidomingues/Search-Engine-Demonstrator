A nickname for the office for firstyear graduate students at the UC Davis Department of Computer Science, located in room 83 in the basement of Kemper Hall. The department just converted a former undergraduate lab, part of Computer Science Instructional Facility The Dungeon, to a room reserved for M.S. and PhD students. 

Jim Shearer came up with the nickname and it soon became so popular that the sign on the door of room 83 was altered to reflect its new name. 

The GNU/Linux boxes in the Grad Cave are pc30.cs.ucdavis.edu, pc63.cs.ucdavis.edu and pc76.cs.ucdavis.edu. There are also three SunRay terminals.
