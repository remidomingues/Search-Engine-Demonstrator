The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is like the SAT, but computerized and intended for students applying to graduate school. Like the regular SAT, the General GRE tests for basic math skills, vocabulary, and writing. The subject GREs go into more detail on specific fields.

The General Test is given yearround as a computerbased test in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries. Paperbased General Test administrations are offered in areas of the world where computerbased testing is not available.

Davis does not have a testing site for the general GREs; the http://etsis4.ets.org/tcenter/MQResults.jsp?zip95616&closestn5 closest site is in Fair Oaks, so students without cars are pretty screwed. However, the subject GREs  biology, literature, philosophy, etc.  are available periodically on campus.

If anyone could provide information on bus services and other public transportation to the Fair Oaks GRE site, that would be great.
