The Graduate School of Management (GSM) is an wiki:MBA (Master of Business Administration) program at UC Davis.  It comprises 123 daytime wiki:MBA students representing a variety of nationalities and more than 40 undergraduate programs.  The school also has two Working Professional MBA programs, one of which has been based in Sacramento, and http://www.gsm.ucdavis.edu/ProspectiveStudents/index.aspx?id229 the other opened in 2007 in http://maps.google.com/maps?fd&sources_d&saddrdavis,+ca&daddrsan+ramon,+ca&hlen&geocode&mrals&sll34.028504,118.407171&sspn0.12747,0.2211&ieUTF8&ll37.892196,122.025146&spn0.971042,1.768799&z9 San Ramon.  Like many wiki:MBA programs, it is made available to business people who are obtaining their wiki:MBA concurrent with an active career, often many years after their undergraduate degree.

Beginning in Fall 2012, the Graduate School of Management will be the first UC to offer a Master of Professional Accountancy degree (MPAc). This oneyear program will admit students from broad backgrounds in economics, statistics, engineering, and other degrees that fulfill the prerequisites, and qualifies candidates to sit for the California CPA exam. The program will be open to students with any bachelor’s degree from an accredited (by local or national accrediting agencies) college or university, and who meet the minimum entrance requirements (http://gsm.ucdavis.edu/overview/masterprofessionalaccountancy).

The school also offers an undergraduate minor in Technology Management for undergrads in science related majors. There is a competitive http://www.gsm.ucdavis.edu/ProspectiveStudents/index.aspx?id766&m267&m34&m16 application process which requires a significant amount of prerequisite courses to apply, but the payoff is that you get to take classes from actual business professors and get a degree conferred upon you from the actual school of management (which is pretty cool).

The GSM is now located in the Maurice J. Gallagher Hall, which earned a LEED “platinum” certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2011.
