Graduate Tutorial Services, LLC is no longer in business as of Dec. 2013. Were still here just that our name and business distinction have changed.

Many clients now use GRADTUTORS, a sole proprietorship, to obtain Graduate level tutors, in and around Davis. We have been assisting students with their coursework in Northern California and in the Davis area since May of 07.

Note to prospective tutors: We are always recruiting tutors! You are a good candidate to be a tutor of ours if:

1. You have been awarded a university undergraduate degree.
2. You Have a 3.5 or better undergraduate GPA.
3. You are strong in Math and or the Sciences (ie. Chemistry or Calculus or Physics, or Biology or Economics or Statistics, etc.).
4. Are a helpful, kind, and generous person.
5. You arent considering depending on us to be your sole source of income.

Tutors make anywhere from $15 to $25 per hour depending on the level of course they are called upon to assist with. We tutor mainly UC Davis undergrads.

Hours vary greatly depending on demand (ie. zero to many per week). Typically each client needs a couple hours of tutoring per week. Some weeks youll have zero clients while others you could have multiple clients.

If you are interested, please send your resume and your unofficial transcripts from all undergraduate/graduate coursework completed to the email address listed below.

Our motto is:  Scholars at your service
