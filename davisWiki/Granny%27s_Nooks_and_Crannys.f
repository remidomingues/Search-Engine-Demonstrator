Grannys Nooks and Crannys is a homebased business in Davis with a strong smalltown feel to their presentation.  It is located in what looks like a residential home across the street from the Olive Drive Market and the The Lexington Apartments. Its vaguely reminiscent of a yard sale which your grandmother might hold, but with a giant handpainted sign on permanent display. Grannys sells interesting and hardtofind antiques and collectibles and also sells through eBay. The prices are inline with what hardtofind and soughtafter collectables tend to run.


20051021 13:56:52 nbsp i was just in there last week and there is actually some pretty cool stuffjust hard to find and overpriced. but the granny is nice... Users/MyaBrn

20051203 16:35:27 nbsp I lived on Olive Drive for five years and never went in that place (but really, can you blame me?). Wish there was more info on it here. :P Users/AubreyJohnson

20070119 05:39:56 nbsp Where do you get such comments, as its kind of like a yard sale?  Its a very intriguing shop with an overwhelming number  of oneofakind items,  especially the kind of things people collect.  In no way does it resemble any yard sale Ive ever been to, which is to say that its a rather obvious misnomer.   Or why such a snide remark as, whenever  grandma is up?  The OPEN flag is out when the shop is open.   People should expect some real attempt at accuracy when they consult Wiki about places in Davis, which will make it a very excellent resource.  In short, malicious people should not be allowed to enter data into Wiki, or Wiki  will eventually be discredited as a site where people just express their petty opinions instead of facts.  Note that the notsobright person who decided to list the shop could not even get the name of the shop right.  CTR. Users/ColemanRandall
   Those comments stand because nobody else knows more.  I cant correct it because for all I know, the proprietor actually says whenever Grandma is up when asked for her hours.  If you know more about the store, please dont complain about the wrong information, simply correct it.  Its clear that not many people know much (one of the two comments is Wish there was more info), so please add what you know.  In the absence of any real information, poorly informed opinion will always fill the void... that has nothing to do with the wiki and is purely a function of human behavior.  All you added in your comment was opinion, no expansion or additional information about the actual subject (other than the correction of the name, for which I thank you  Ive renamed the entry).

   Would you prefer the hours be changed to whenever the open flag is out? Users/TravisGrathwell
   Jesus CTR, and JabberWokky is the malicious one?  Users/ChrisWaterstraat

20070119 13:48:22 nbsp The owner makes most of her business by selling on eBay, thats why she can be open whenever she wants.  Users/MyaBrn

20070215 09:24:58 nbsp The lady is sort of nice. She panics if you bring in small children. No wonder because the place is so full of stuff its hard to move around. For being so cluttered she seems to know where certain things are. Users/MyaBrn

20080612 10:38:29 nbsp A lot of really racist items here, and the whole atmosphere is creepy. Users/elizalee
   Id be curious to know a single racist item you found in this place.  Also, the atmosphere of cluttered, centuryold treasures may just be an odd setting for you.  Maybe you should stick to Ikea? Users/AmandaAbughosh

20100414 15:16:47 nbsp It scared me when I was in there.  Its so cramped and tight... I kept wondering if it was a firetrap!  :) Users/Plodder

20100615 19:36:54 nbsp I live right next door to this shop and it is open almost everyday from maybe 105pm.  Those are the hours I notice the open flag out on the fence.  I LOVE this place.  I have gotten so many cute items here.  I am a huge fan of small make up compacts and lipstick holders, perfume bottles, cigarette cases...and many other antique items.  As for the price, I dont think many people are familiar with what these items usually cost, because the prices at Grannys Nooks and Crannys are AMAZING!  I also shop at The House Dresser, in woodland, which is similar to this shop, and the prices are nearly double on most items, though I love both stores. Users/AmandaAbughosh

20100626 16:26:27 nbsp Really an amazing place. I dont get what everyone dislikes about it!
Sure, its a little cramped, but the things you would find are amazing! I spent over an hour there just looking!!
Definitely go here!! Users/Arina

To the girl who thinks there are no racist items in the store I dont know how else you can describe all the creepy Mammie figurines of grossly obese and servile AfricanAmerican women. Its like a constant allusion to Aunt Jemima. The cute Disney figurines dont really compensate. Creepy is the right word for the store. Users/KittenLover

20101208 10:53:29 nbsp I love her old place. The store is two rooms filled to the brim with surprises. Some of my best treasures I’ve got there. I drop by every Christmas and buy some things and talk to the nice lady. She’s a very kind women. The treasures I’ve bought there include a wood puppet ornament from 1860 of Santa Claus. If your you looking for unique items  it’s a very good bet you’ll find them there. Users/sageaqua
