I propose a 32x32 icon size with a 4px graphic border (thus resulting in a 40px square icon).  The background is #FFFFAA.  (Im fairly certain people agree with this, so treat this as point one).

Im thinking of creating a 16 (or 8) color palette with 996633 as the darkest color and a lighter color than the background for the highlight.  An example image would be: Image(photo_request6.png)  Note that Im not proposing this as a final icon, just as a rough example of the colors.  It allows for definition of icon, but also does not stand out too much.  Something like Arlens recent stub icon is easily tweaked into the same colors: Image(color_stub.png)  (No, thats not a final palette or icon... just a quick and dirty one).

Later...

Okay, I resized, rebordered and recolored all the icons.  I went with the new photo and stub icons:


Are there any others?


  The comment integration one is really lame IMHO, I dont have any ideas, but im sure as a community, we can come up with something better. Then again, im not sure we even need a comment integration include macro...  Users/ArlenAbraham

Arlen, when I did the PhotoRequest current camera icon, I tried to keep the yellow background and the theme of dark gray silhouette style icons at 64x48.  I was worried that notice icons with more prominent colors would overwhelm the page.  Do you think head on is better?  Users/JabberWokky jw
 I was going for as small and as compact as possible. Here are some with a little transparancy. Your camera is better than the old one which was kinda hokey. Really, this was just me playing around in MS paint.  Users/ArlenAbraham
    I think its probably better slightly smaller (approx. arlens size) because otherwise it does seem to dominate.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
      I was going with the sizes and style that predated the ones I made.  I actually think that lowering the contrast a bit and resizing them smaller overall and increasing the ratio of the margin would be best.  Also, IE still doesnt support transparent pngs, so I drop all alpha and index (to 8 colors, IIRC) in the final save.  I store them all as GIMP xcfs, and it sure would be nice to upload the layer originals for people to edit (hint hint).  Some of them are also in 256x192 in their original form, and sized down in that final save.  Users/JabberWokky jw


Shrunk and margined with a contrasting color (picked up from the unselected tabs).  Not my favorite, but I figured Id toss it out.


Shrunk and margined with a complimentary color.  Stands out less, I think I might even try a lower contrast version.  I think it already looks better than the dark gray original (I also use highlights lighter than the background in this one).
  More detail is also preserved in this version than the blueish one.
     Yup, thats part of the reason why I made the highlights lighter than the background.  jw


Arlens original, 40% opacity, shifted a bit toward reddish brown.  For an icon of this size, the face on icon is much more recognizable, IMO.  jw


As long as were rethinking icons, how about photorealism?


Or photobordered?

  I laughed when I saw this one.  I definitely would have to say this one is the best  Users/JulienBiewerElstob JE

Here is a 32px square stub icon. Im not sure that 32 is the right size, but it gave me a little bit of border.

Heres the same image, no border

    Very nice.  Im leaning toward this one.  (I did the original stub and I dont personally like it).
