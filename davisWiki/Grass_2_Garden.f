A project born in 2014, members of Transition Davis want to help Davis residents turn their lawns into food producing, water saving gardens.   Your yard can produce food, provide habitat for wildlife, provide food for bees and other pollinators, look beautiful, inspire creativity in your neighborhood, and so much more!  Why dedicate it to a monoculture of waterguzzling grass? Lets build community around local food production!
