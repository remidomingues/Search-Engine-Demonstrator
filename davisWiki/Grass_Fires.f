Summer in Davis Summers in Davis can be bone dry and really hot.  This combination is fuel for fire, and sure enough grass fires are a very common occurrence.  Unfortunately, a good number of these are caused by negligence (like smokers who flick their stilllit butts from car windows) and sometimes even Arson malintent.  The fires contribute to air pollution in the valley.

Thankfully they are rare (though not rare enough) in town. In 2005, a fire made its way along Highway 113 and sadly burned one house.  In 2008, a fire burned in the old Putah Creek channel along the south section of the Davis Bike Loop, leaving charred trees and ground visible for the rest of the summer.

Some fire statistics are available via the City of Davis City, Yolo County, and UC Davis Universitys  emergency call logs (http://www.firedispatch.com). (select Yolo county from the list)

Precipitation is measured since the preceding September: thus, the season of rain.

UC Davis has a http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8636 list of professors doing research related to grass fires.  From studying the formation of nanoparticles of soot to planning for the evacuation of horses, a good deal of fire related research occurs on campus.

Wildfires are a commonplace threat in California, and the Department of Forestry has a specific website where they put all their http://www.fire.ca.gov/index.php fire related information. Of particular note is the http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/incidents/incidents_current list of current and past fires.
