Not all inhabitants of Davis are among the living.  In time we all have to pass on, and some choose to continue to reside in our town.  Here are the places where they can be found:


  Davis Cemetery
    Davis Cemetery Labyrinth
    Davis Cemetery Veterans Marker
  The Tremont Church and Cemetery

Other Graveyards 

Not all graveyards have people in them.

  Monitor Graveyard
