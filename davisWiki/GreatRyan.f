20091110 05:08:29 nbsp Hey Ryan... if you really thought the wiki was for cool people, you really must have been confused it with a completely different web site!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091110 10:50:07 nbsp Dont be so modest, now that Im here, there can be no denying it! Users/GreatRyan

20091110 12:14:49 nbsp Hahaha, great, now everyone will think Im a commaphile Users/GreatRyan


20091110 17:18:22 nbsp I guess youre a proponent of the Oxford comma, then (aka serial comma, Harvard comma). Users/CovertProfessor

20091110 17:32:04 nbsp aka Tha Goo

dont let him tell you otherwise people Users/StevenDaubert

20091110 20:20:32 nbsp A slate of one isnt a slate. People have conflated slates with parties, and theyre not. A slate is a group of people who have decided to help each other out in the election. So, a slate of one is just stupid. Users/WilliamLewis

20091110 20:41:53 nbsp A slate of one ordinary man might be stupid, but a slate of Ryan? Brilliant! Users/GreatRyan

20091110 20:44:39 nbsp I think what William is trying to say that a slate of one isnt likely to go over well on the wiki  it will be seen as trying to promote yourself above the other independents without justification. Users/CovertProfessor
 It has been done before, actually. wl

20091110 20:51:44 nbsp Ryan, thanks for the suggestions...

Sophias thai icedtea($3) has free refills  I like Sophias just fine and go there fairly often.  Im not a fan of Thai icedtea, though.
Cultive now is self serve, and has more flavors (even Pistachio!)  I get the impression that Cultiv√© is for real frozen yogurt lovers.  Im happy with the stuff that tastes more like ice cream.  :)  I think they are smart to see that selfserve is the way to go.  They were getting complaints on the wiki about inconsistencies with their portion sizes and how pricey they were compared to the other yogurt shops.
The last time I went to Fluffy Donut they were out of creme filled, but filled a chocolate longjohn for me :)  Good to know!
How is there no Chipotle review?  I seldom review the chain restaurants, figuring that a restaurant in a chain is more or less like another restaurant in the same chain.  In other words, been to one Chipotle, been to them all.  Ive never actually been to Daviss Chipotle.  In fact, Ive only been to one Chipotle.  It was OK, but nothing Id get excited about. Users/CovertProfessor

20091110 21:08:57 nbsp Have you tried Taqueria Guadalajara?  Lots of food for the money and free chips and salsa. Users/CovertProfessor

  Half a super giant burrito fills even the likes of me up. For more cheap food, there are plenty of Asian restaurants with decent serving sizes for around five dollars or so (no racist). Users/hankim

20091110 21:35:42 nbsp Of course thats what I was trying to do! For some reason the Slates are listed above the Independents, and Im near the bottom the pile, so I was hoping to unfairly promote myself a tad. Users/GreatRyan

20091111 15:04:18 nbsp In regard to your comment to Users/WilliamLewis. It isnt about giving up. We are all equal editors engaged in collaborative editing. William was applying some good layout style to the page. Remember when positioning elements that different people have different sized screens. Users/JasonAller

20091111 20:29:48 nbsp I was playfully surrendering. I just thought it was funny because I didnt realize other people could edit it, so I kept moving it and wondering why it didnt stay. That being said; with my impractically huge monitor Ill definitely trust his edits :) Users/GreatRyan
 It was even worse on my 15 laptop screen than my 22! Anyway, what did you think a wiki was if you didnt know others could edit it? wl
             Im just accustomed to less organic things. I like that my page is open to anyone who wants to change it, but I have a little letting go (of control) yet to do Users/GreatRyan GR

20091201 14:53:41 nbsp Thank you for the kind note, but dont forget that youre an editor here too!  Some people have the inclination to put in lots of effort, but lots of people put in the little bit they can  and that adds up quickly.  The wiki is a product of the community that contributes, and the recognition goes to everybody who edits the wiki.   Users/JabberWokky

20100801 23:55:25 nbsp Hey Ryan, you can generally use the material on Davis Wiki as long as you attribute it either to the project (DavisWiki) or the author (Jason Aller).  Check out our copyrights page.  The wiki really is free in all respects. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100922 10:25:18 nbsp Sure, the pages are all a collaborative effort.  I tweaked the pics a bit again to remove some of the big blocks of white space.  See what you think  I think its better without them. Users/CovertProfessor
