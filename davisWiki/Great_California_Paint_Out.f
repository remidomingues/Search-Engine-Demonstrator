The third annual Great California Paint Out! will be held in conjunction with the  12 h California Landscape Exhibition on September 21, 2013. This event gives participating artists an opportunity to paint in the entirety of downtown Davis in groups or individually, as well as the opportunity to exhibit at the John Natsoulas Gallery. This fun, one day event is the celebration of painting plein air like the great masters. All work completed during the day will be hung in a special one night only gallery auction. Artists of all mediums have the opportunity to sell their work at a major gallery. The work will be judged by an exclusive artist panel and prizes will be awarded that evening.

Last year over 90% of the art work sold at the silent auction. This is a great opportunity for artists of all mediums and experience.
