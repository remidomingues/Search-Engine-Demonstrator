Great Clips is a Hair Salons and Barber Shops salon where you can get a fairly inexpensive haircut, and sometimes they do a pretty good job.  A basic haircut is $14, seniors (65 and over) and children (10 and under) are $12.  Great Clips accepts all competitors coupons for $2 off. Their prices appear to be lower than Supercuts on purpose.  They currently offer a value card that can be preloaded, similar to a giftcard, and reduces the price of haircuts to $9.99.

There used to be a Great Clips in Anderson Plaza. That location closed and was taken over by Quickly.

20050623 11:07:06 nbsp Dont like the wait for a cheapo haircut. SS

20060304 12:34:38 nbsp the mrs. likes them, they do what she asks, unlike to many fancy salons who have an artistic vision for your hair. Users/RocksandDirt

20060403 15:47:25 nbsp Decent haircut, fair price.  Stylists are nice but the wait can really suck.  I suggest late evenings (8 pm to close) or Sat/Sunday evenings to avoid crowds.  South Davis location seems to be busier than North Davis location. Users/UsetheForce

20060731 15:42:21 nbsp I got my hair cut at the Cowell location during my lunch break once and almost didnt do back to work. It was not what I wanted at all. And on top of that the woman who cut my hair pretty much ignored me and chatted with her friend the entire time. Needless to say, I did not go back. Users/MattCzarnowski

20060803 13:52:30 nbsp Do not get you hair cut here! Users/DipanPatel
  Interesting, you said the exact same thing on the Supercuts page. Did you actually get your hair cut at either place, or do you work at a rival business? Users/zombiek

20061101 13:49:03 nbsp going to great clips is like playing russian roulette: most of the time its ok, but if your luck runs out, it REALLY runs out.  to that extent the price is not worth it.  Users/MarisolCortez

20061203 14:34:14 nbsp I went in for my first time to Great Clips today (a Sunday) and had a decent experience. There was no wait, so I was in right away. I explained that I wanted just a simple trim, about 23 inches off my length and my layers cleaned up. The gal, I think her name was Elizabeth, did just that. She was friendly but not too chatty or personal. If you are looking for a quick/easy cut, Id recommend this to anyone.  Users/KaitlinSufit

20070117 21:30:49 nbsp This place cant cut hair for shit! They ruined my sides and sideburns by cutting it too hight! What kind of place does that? I truly believe their barbers are...fuck Im so mad I cant even think of anything to describe them. Stay away from this place, run away.  Users/MacOroni

20070118 22:07:48 nbsp Im a selfproclaimed cheapskate, so I keep convincing myself that it will be okay to get my hair cut here.  They have proven me wrong 4 times.  I will never go back.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20070128 11:20:49 nbsp Im just visiting Davis. Donovan at the Oakshade Town Center cut my hair and did a fab job  as good as my $45 & my $85 cuts in LA. He listened carefully when I told him what I wanted. I wish he could always cut my hair. Bravo! Users/SueHausmann

20070129 02:12:32 nbsp Both times have been good. Informative also... Users/StevenDaubert

20070222 10:27:42 nbsp Horible. I went to get a hair cut last night and after telling the lady(Becky, Who was rode to begin with) what i wanted she asked me to wait for the other lady. that she wouldnt cut my hair. all i wanted was a 1/4 cut of to clean it up i little and she refused. she wasnt even nice about it. so i got up and left, and i will not be going back there. i have never been treated that way before, and i have delt with a lot of rode poeple, but not like this. she refused to cut my hair. Users/JonathanKolsters

20070407 10:49:41 nbsp I just went in and got a haircut for the first time at Great Clips in Anderson Plaza. I came out with one of my most favorite haircuts. Mahnaz listened to what I told her I wanted and kept checking to make sure it was right. She did a great job, better than the $50 cuts Ive gotten at salons. I dont know about the other hairstylists, but I would at least recommend Mahnaz if you can get her. Users/JenniferSpies

20070417 13:14:31 nbsp Great Clips by Cowell (Safeway shopping center) has done a great job for my husband (whose hair I am very picky about) and even with mine (that Im ever more picky about) a bunch of times. Edean (I think shes the owner) is awesome  ask for her. If you just need a simple haircut without the super stylish salon attitude, atmosphere and price, then this is a great place to go. Users/MAD

20070512 16:41:17 nbsp They do a pretty good haircut. The place is usually very clean and well kept. Users/Jedron

20071021 18:57:10 nbsp If I were you, I would only go to Donovan. I feel he is the only one who listens to my needs. The others are could learn something from him. Hes not pushy like Edean. Hes cute! He doesent ignore me, when I walk in the front door like Becky and Ufa. Plus, he pays attention to only me. The others be speaking spanish across the floor. (I dont know what they be saying, or if others are talking about me, but I fell its rude.)         Users/HAL

20080108 16:59:34 nbsp This is one of the worst hair cuts i have ever received in my life. I told the barber exactly how i wanted it and she proceeded to do the exact opposite. I explained very clearly that i didnt want the front cut and the first thing she does is to cut the front unbearably short. It was so quick, i could not even stop her. When she was done butchering my hair, I could hardly look at myself in the mirror without wanting to throw up. It was a horrible nightmare. I am so fucking pissed. I went to the Oakshade Great Clips and the barber was an older female and had short black hair, her name is Becky.  Users/PaulKim

20080113 13:09:24 nbsp I took my son there a few days ago and we had a great experience.  Maria listened to what I wanted and kept him entertained with combs while she was cutting his hair:)  She was friendly and efficient.  Though my 2 year old son isnt a pinnacle of style, I think his haircut looks pretty good!  This was also the first haircut he hasnt cried through... he loved it. Users/KristenMartin

20080223 16:39:37 nbsp They do a good job. Its just hair... Users/IanBenton

20080225 17:25:17 nbsp Got my haircut today with Edean. She is super easy to talk to and did a fabulous job on my haircut. She knows how to match your haircut with your face. I enjoyed every second of it although it was my first time cutting my hair short.  She assured me that it would turn out great, and IT DID!!! Totally recommend her, as well as Donovan who cut my fiances hair. Users/Thu

20080531 18:34:54 nbsp Agree with the other poster who goes to Donovan  hes great, does just what you want, very amiable. While waiting, Ive heard lots of new customers who hes just helped ask his name and say theyll come back to him. I have had bad experienced with other stylists there so I wont let anyone but him cut my hair.  Users/NotSure

20080708 13:11:35 nbsp I would not go here even if the haircuts were free. I stopped by both locations several times because of the convenient locations, however they messed up my hair 4 out of 5 times. Each time I had a different person. The middleaged black guy knew his stuff but all the others were unconfident.
Cutting hair was like guesswork to them. 3 out of 5 times my hair was lopsided and the back was grossly neglected. When I told each of them to fix it (nicely), they haphazardly cut my hair over again in hopes that it would even out. Guy hair cuts should not be that difficult. I got better $8 haircuts back home.

20080714 17:18:45 nbsp Just wanted to let everyone know that Donavan is moving back to his hometown of Monterey this week Users/TORIDUMAS

20080714 17:56:22 nbsp Donavans leavin this week!! Hes moving back to Monterey.. I have been going to see him for a good 6 years. although im happy for him starting his new life, im sad to be losing a great stylist. That shop has gone through some major changes, some good, some bad (like the passing of Catrina on Memorial day). There are alot of new faces but Edeen has cut my hair when Donavan hasnt been there and i have always been pleased, so i am recommending that Donavans customers give her a try.. (shes also quite funny)  If you read this big D Take Care of Yourself and tell Edeen ill see her in about 3 weeks....Your talent was greatly appreciated!!!!!
 Users/evda

20080727 10:34:05 nbsp My son Jukie and I will certainly miss Donovan. He did such a great job, and always remembered details from our previous conversations. Who else can provide such a great skater cut for a screaming sevenyear old? Users/DrandyJones

20080729 21:56:36 nbsp i am a hairstylist, so READ THIS:1,NEVER go toward closing time thats a big huge NO, thats irritating never do that, the stylist still have to clean the place so dnt hold them up longer. 2, be specific and detailed on wut u want. 3, dnt be rude. 4, if they turn the chair DONT turn ur head toward mirror thats IRRITATING! and NEVER leave a ONE dollar tip! thats like so messed, its an insult, think about this: would u tip a WAITRESS more than ud tip ur HAIRDRESSER, who is obviously improving ur appearance???  Users/SamiSam

20080807 22:29:06 nbsp i   asked for a simple trim and they cut three inches  off my hair and gave my 1 inch layers?!? it was hideous! never going there again Users/Baylee

20081113 10:20:41 nbsp last night i went in for a simple cut, actually it wasnt even a full cut, i just wanted to clean up my sides and fade it. first off, they cant fade for shit! my sides are uneven, not to mention while attemping to fade, THEY SHAVED OFF PART OF MY EYEBROW!!!! i left without noticing because i just wanted to get the hell out of there, came home and noticed the spot where my eyebrow used to be, came back, and the stylist that cut my hair 5 mins ago pretended that she didnt even do it!!! another stylist ended up giving my money back, i only paid 5 cuz i had a coupon, and they gave me back 14 ahaha stupid bitches, im never going here again! Users/dtruong

20090313 16:44:09 nbsp I get my hair cut exlusively by Edean. She is absolutely fantastic and gets the job done right the first time. Every other stylist there has either disappointed or completely ruined my hair.  Users/xen0cide

20090430 18:43:22 nbsp Just so everyone knows the ACTUAL prices of Great Clips, they are $ 14 for adults and $12 for children 10 and under and persons 65 and older. They also except all competator coupons and expired coupons for $2 off. Users/hairstylist

20100221 14:54:34 nbsp I went to get my hair cut today, and they were AMAZING! Friendly people. I loved my haircut and the concentration Sharron had. I only waited about 1 minute. Will definitely go there again.  Users/vmgbac

20100422 12:20:21 nbsp It is an okay place to go. I cant complain for a $14 hair cut.  Users/LuvMyPets

20101221 14:50:20 nbsp I went again yesterday because my mother wouldnt take me anywhere else to get my haircut done. I showed them a picture of what I wanted, and she said I will give you some layers, and I have no layers, it seriously looks like a 3 year old cut my hair. It is also lopsided, and I just called, and the lady was just like Ok, come in later, but you will still have to pay for it. I mean seriously, the least they could do is fix it for free! But I can assure everyone, if you go there you will come back looking like a 3 year old cut your hair. I also have really straight hair at the ends, so you can see the scissor marks. So dont waste your money coming here.  Users/Churro615

20110102 14:57:25 nbsp Forget the coupons.  It is not worth it.  I just got home and discovered that the employee just played with scissors behind my head.  I asked to have my hair cut over my ears and over my collar, and all she did for twenty minutes was clip scissors in the air and spray my hair down and comb it.  I do not have difficult hair and my instructions were clear.  Supercuts does not have coupons, but they can at least do a basic simple haircut. Users/aharjala

20120602 23:01:48 nbsp Dont go here at all. I asked for a simple cut, and I ended up with my hair being all lopsided. Seriously, its like a little 4 year old cut my hair... The price for my lopsided haircut was $16, and I had to tip? I guess I shouldnt have since it was that horrible. Users/JaceWinter

20120903 12:13:09 nbsp Wish they would have said they were closed today (Labor day) :( Oh well, I went somewhere else and got a great haircut.  Users/jsbmeb

20121103 22:01:04 nbsp Oh god, why did I ever choose to come here... I asked for a simple trim on the side and just shorten the top just a little. The front side of my hair ended up lopsided along with parts of the back of my head. There were parts of my hair that were way longer than the rest of my head. All I heard during my whole time getting a haircut was snip snip, no stopping or anything to check if it looked good. 1.5/5 would not recommend Users/JaceWinter
