The Great Horned Owl, named for its ear tufts, is the largest Owls owl in the area. Its call is the familiar Hoo hoohoo hoo hoooo. They become active at dusk and hunt through the night. Large birds to begin with, a great horned owl can capture and kill prey 3 times heavier than its own weight  including housecats and small dogs.

There is a great horned owl living in East Davis. Its been spotted (and heard) regularly in the neighborhoods along Pole Line Road Pole Line, between 5th and 8th streets, during the spring of 2007.

20100601 21:58:59 nbsp Our neighbor found a baby great horned! On the corner of 8th and Oak, so it may have fallen out of the willow tree there. It was the cutest/most beautiful/most fearless little thing ever  grey and puffy, and with HUGE eyes. Lucky to have seen it. Now its recuperating well at the campus Raptor Center. Users/jmofro

20120615 23:03:12 nbsp a thin all white cat disappeared Monday  June 11, 2012 from the apartments behind the shopping center on Lake Blvd. in West Davis.  I often hear the horned owls fly by in this area  they make a clicking sound.  Could the owls possibly have taken the white cat?  I think an all white cat would be especially visible in the dark.  Please advise. Users/nanturner
 Great Horned Owls are certainly capable of catching a cat, though it would be difficult for them to fly away with it. Theyre known to eat other small mammals like skunks, but given the abundance of rats, mice, birds, frogs and everything else in Davis theyre probably  more inclined to go after prey that doesnt have retractable claws. Cars, coons, dogs, and other cats are more significant threats.  Users/mikeycrews
