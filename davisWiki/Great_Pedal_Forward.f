Great Pedal Forward is an initiative within the Bike Church to increase their physical, organizational and administrative efficiency.


 Meetings 

Great Pedal Forward meetings are being held every Friday at 6 pm at the Domes Community Yurt.  The Great Pedal Forward has sped up and veered in a new direction.  This was spurred by our recent notice of eviction from our current location by Student Housing.  See the main Bike Church page for further details.  This page is a great record of all the work we did over the summer, and will continue to do.

Fundraising

We are currently in the process of raising money to fund the transformation of the Bike Church into a better place.  The funds raised will go toward the Bike Church/Great Pedal Forward Great Pedal Forward, which is an initiative to increase our physical, organizational and administrative efficiency. This movement will create a more inviting and functional space, which will allow us to increase the population served by the Bike Church not only in the campus community, but also in the larger Davis community. It will also help us to use volunteers more effectively through a cleaner and more organized physical space and organizational structure. While the Bike Church has thrived and grown in its first four years, we need to raise money in order allow the Bike Church to create a sustainable foundation for serving the community for years to come.

We started things off with dance party fundraiser on May 16th, 2008. We raffled off bicycles and other goodies and had local DJs spining late into the evening. It turned out to be a massive party and we received $1440 from donations and merchandise sales. Thanks to everyone who attended and donated. We hope we can have a great party like that on a regular basis.

If you are interested in donating you can either purchase our Bike Church/Merchandise Merchandise or donate directly to us: contact MailTo(bikeministry AT ucdavis DOT edu).

For those interested here is some details about how much money weve been raising:


 Mission Statement 

From a group discussion of what the Bike Church should be all about:

 People can help each other, share skills, and empower each other in fixing and repairing their own bicycles.
 Resource use and reuse emphasized and practiced.
 Tools are shared and learned to use correctly.
 Bicycle repair is taught not done as a service.
 Sustainable bicycle/human powered culture is cultivated.
 Waste is given another chance at reuse.
 Getting as many people riding their bikes is paramount.
 The idea where the disconnection from knowledge is smashed.
 A place where one can shout Boom Shakalaka Gaia.
 A place where community can be built through the communication of knowledge and the practice of sustainable/recycled transportation.
