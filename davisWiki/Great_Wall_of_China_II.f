The Great Wall of China II was a Chinese restaurants restaurant in downtown Davis. They had arguably the best Chinese Buffets Buffet in Davis. The main reason for this is that as of 2005, it was the only one to offer General Tsos chicken (also spelled Tsao). Now, a Chinese buffet isnt a Chinese buffet without the General Tsos chicken. An American creation (1972) named after Chinese General Tso Tsungtang, its a deepfried battered, sweet gingergarlic spiced chicken dish.

They offered a number of other items, most of which are  very good. Their lunch buffet was $9.95 ($8.95 with coupon in the Little Green Coupon Machine). You could get a togo box which, if you didnt waste room on rice, would fit copious amounts of whatever sort of meaty stuff you wanted to put into it. If you wanted meat, that is. They also were one of a few places that offer lo mein.

For dinner, their special was suggested, assuming you paid the upgrade to get general chicken instead of King Pao or whatever.

Dinein dinner after 3PM was 10% off with Student ID. Local delivery was available for purchases over $25 for $5, compared to the $2 of most restaurants in Davis.

Change in ownership: This restaurant had changed ownership since October 2010. The new owners brought new menu choices including new traditional Chinese dishes to its list of options in the nearest future.
The new owners also sold frozen dumplings (Chinese: 水饺) on a togo basis. It was priced at $6.95 for 18pc, and you got one (18pc) free when you bought three (18pc).

In addition, the restaurant allowed most substitutions/customizations at no additional cost. Heres what they did for free:
  No MSG
  Less oil
  Steamed (v.s. fried, for some menu items)
  More spicy / less spicy
  Brown rice (v.s. white rice, for lunch and combination items)
  Sauce / veggies substitutions



Drew recommends the chow mein, the fried rice, the spring rolls, and the pot stickers. I made the mistake of not reading this before I went, and I can definitely attest to the fact that the wontons are terrible. The orange (?) chicken was pretty good too. Great deal, I stuffed myself. Drew

They have a good takeout option, I believe, with a discount.  Theres a family dinner with several decent dishes for between $30 and $35 (I think it includes a deepfried flounder, soup, a vegetable dish, and a beef dish) that will easily feed 4 people if you get rice as well.  Im not sure if its on the regular menu, though, so you may have to ask for it over the phone. Users/CynthiaHe

I ordered the special dinner for one and it was a freaking ridiculous amount of food for one person for 10 bucks. I really hate it when people post good deals at shitty places, but thats what Im going to do now. Two people can eat easily. Users/JoeConte

I ate here for lunch recently, and the waiter said that you dont get a togo box with the buffet. I noticed someone come in and order a togo box and he filled it with whatever was left of the s&s pork, so Im assuming you only get the togo box if you get a regular meal and not the buffet. Users/DaiNguyen

And dont forget the plastic bags. Users/TaylorClark

20070127 15:13:48 nbsp The food here isnt the greatest, but its the best buffet in Davis hands down. If you want to stuff your face cheaply, this is the place to do it. Users/ChrisMay

20070131 08:50:31 nbsp Anyone want to figure out the TOGOBOX trick!? o.O  Users/FrankYoung

20070321 12:01:48 nbsp I think the ToGo box deal is that you pay for the buffet but you are not staying to eat in restaurant so get as much as you can fit in the box for the price of the buffet.  Ive seen people try to cheap by dumping food in the bag and was stopped by the wait staff. Users/HuyTran

20070323 21:44:45 nbsp Pretty tasty for Davis. Of course, cant hold a candle to what you can find in SF. The folks are rude, no surprise.  Users/KeithJose

20070328 10:25:45 nbsp The food here is okay... seems like they use MSG though... but overall, its okay. I get food delivered since I live in West Davis and the driver is always nice to me. If youre looking for largely more authentic Chinese food, go somewhere else! Most of their food is very americanized. Users/CalvinCheng

20070408 22:51:13 nbsp Its not bad for Davis. We always order the same thing which I think is their best stuff: seveningredients soup, orange chicken (best OC Ive had), and hot braised tofu w/ vegetables. The best deal is their lunch buffet, though.   Users/noahsark

20070716 13:31:50 nbsp Food here is good except I agree that MSG is used quite a bit which makes it taste the same at times. Most dishes are Americanized but I doubt many eat pure Chinese food. Users/BrandonToo

20070717 19:10:09 nbsp I like the general chicken the way it was cooked about 2 years ago i like smaller crunchier pieces , i must say they have made improvements, for example the cheese won ton has more cheese finally awesome they do listen to customers. Also the sweet & sour chicken is good easy dish but very good and crunchy. Great other vegetable dishes also the beef broccoli is great and tender beef, they really made this place way better check it out!!   Users/dickjones

20070820 23:13:36 nbsp I took out some lo fun and the spicy garlic broccoli a few nights ago.  Service was friendly and the food was good.  Nothing to write home about, but tasty.  Its interesting to hear comments about MSG because you can totally taste it.  I will definitely ask them not to use it next time.  Users/HopeMirlis

20071006 10:27:24 nbsp I really enjoyed several of their dishes; its way better than back home in Placerville! I highly recommend it for someone on a tight budget like me, and wants variety.
Service was prompt, kind and friendly
Lots of different kinds of great food
No free refills on sodas
Great Teriyaki Chicken for a (Chinese buffet)
Sushi not so good (tightly packed, very limited varieties)
Plenty of fried yummies
 Users/AnnaF

20071006 11:44:45 nbsp Not the best chinese food in town, I usually go to silver dragon if Im downtown. Users/AlexJohnson

20071007 22:38:24 nbsp I went there for the lunch buffet today with some friends, and Id have to say that Great Wall pretty much meets the expectations for any Chinese food buffet.  Heaps and heaps of mediocre, but filling food for a reasonable price.  Tons of grease and fried food  a good time for a hungry college student with limited funds.  I must say, however, that towards the end of my meal, my roommate found a fly, charred black and wingless, in his fried rice after he finished about half of it.    For some reason, I cant say that I didnt expect something like this to happen.  That being said, Ill probably come back here in the future and just hope the flies avoid the wok next time. Users/BrianMac

20071008 13:48:05 nbsp I went here at the beginning of the quarter with my friend five minutes before they closed. The owner was so nice and served us our small appetizer. They stayed open late and did not pressure us to leave at all. They also gave us more then the 10% discount. Theyre dumplings are AMAZING and I highly recommend them. Users/dirtyblondebear

20071105 08:32:00 nbsp Me and my friends often hit the lunch buffet for a chinese binge... Users/WillJobe

20071225 17:30:25 nbsp One would expect the quality of food at a buffet to be lackluster, but not here. The trick is just to know what to get. For me, its egg flower soup, steamed rice, general chicken, some fruit, and their tofu dish. Maybe even some jello if I feel like it. Users/thelonepiper555

20080107 13:47:11 nbsp Got two take out items here for the first time last night. Vegetable Fried Rice was amazing. And Kung Pao Tofu was very tasty. Three meals worth for 11 bucks.  Users/desiree

20080606 00:46:35 nbsp The lunch buffet is now $8.35/ person

funny thing is... the price was at $7.55 fall 07/08. In winter, price went up to $8.10.. Now (spring 08), the price soared to $8.35

one of the workers told me items were getting expensive; seems awkward since the price went up nearly a dollar less than a year.
Well, I went to Rajs indian restaurant and the price remained the same.. woodstocks also Users/xcutioners

20080606 01:39:26 nbsp $8.35 for their lunch buffet? Thats starting to get a bit steep considering their buffet food is just OK. Honestly though, it doesnt surprise me that they are having to raise prices. Several times when Ive been in there for the lunch buffet, groups of junior high or highschool kids have come in, chowed down, and then run out before the check comes. Perhaps they should reformat the buffet to pay before you eat. Users/RyanCoates

20080607 14:24:46 nbsp To put my two cents in on the price raise, there IS a shortage of rice... and i suppose that has driven up the material price of things! Though i havent visited them in awhile, i still crawl this page sometimes in case i want delivery... Users/CalvinCheng

20080618 00:52:22 nbsp I found this place kind of not that great. Maybe because I had super high expectations for it, but I was pretty disappointed with the service. For chinese food that was extra greasy and just like packaged foods thrown together. Shrimp, canned mushrooms, packaged artificial crab..etc in everything. Super salty chicken..too. / Yikes! Users/MissAmyQ

20080803 16:57:02 nbsp The last time I came here, I paid 10 dollars for the buffet. Hardly not worth it.  Users/AvidSpots

20080803 18:21:47 nbsp If I want Chinese (food), Ill go over to Woodland and have arguably the best Chinese Buffet in YOYO county for only $7.50. Users/shawn650

  but would you be spending at least that much just on gas..? Users/AnthonyLam

20080906 13:19:28 nbsp I got a ton of food here for a very small price. I stuffed myself, and the food was good. Users/ran123456

20081031 16:54:51 nbsp its cheap for a reason.  Users/vchow

20081121 14:05:05 nbsp pretty good food. The lunch special is unbeatable for 5 bucks. Users/manu

20090220 20:03:31 nbsp Cold buffet food. Not very tasty. However, I have not had anything but the buffet, so maybe the freshly prepared items are better.  Users/EricaMacGregor

20090920 00:23:12 nbsp Ate here on a Monday night with my family and although the restaurant was empty, they sat us at a table right next to the only other people that were there... which we found strange.  The table was sticky and the food was pretty terrible.  But it was cheap, and they were really nice, so all I can say is that you get what you pay for. Users/JesBisagno

20091204 10:58:48 nbsp I ate here with my family last night.  while we were sitting a german cockroach ran behind me on the seat, my wife went to use the bathroom and they had NO working toilets, not even in the mens room.  Our dinner came with a cup of hot and sour soup that was WAY too spicy (I have had hot and sour soup many times and this just had way too much pepper). I asked our server about it and he said if they dont make it spicy people wont order it, because it was obviously the soup of the day I was not going to demand they make a whole pot just so I could have another cup.  Call me bold but I ate here despite the roach, the food was very good.  Mu shu chicken was very flavorfull but I was annoyed by the service and facilities. Users/DagonJones

20100511 12:33:17 nbsp Ordered here for delivery.... TERRIBLE idea

The mushu pork was so salty it was basically inedible, and the lo mein just seemed cheap and crappy

Better places to go in town, and house of chang does better delivery Users/JamesM


20101121 1:36:18   I went to this restaurant for the dinner last week with my friends. The owners are very nice couple and they told us that they took over this restaurant a month ago. The dishes are very delicious and service is so good and in addition as an grant opening bonus, we received a complementary dish having special traditional dumplings, which is one of their highlights as the owner mentioned, and they are really the best ones I have ever tried in Sacramento area. One of my friend said he will definitely come here every week to feed his big stomach while I am looking forward to trying their housespecial bbq lamb next time. —FionaLee

20101123 12:13:57 nbsp They now have some very nice lamb food. If you like lamb, please try there.  Users/Guanyao

20110112 21:41:34 nbsp If you want real authentic Chinese food, I would high recommend this place. (go for the dinner, especially the lamb dishes) If you want your old school Americanized Chinese food, go for the lunch.  Last time we had 11 people and each paid about $8 for dinner and we ate so much that cant walk to our cars. Users/YuHou

20110123 3:7:43 nbsp I really enjoyed this place. I got the special dinner for one, the serving was HUGE for something that was about ten dollars. Fried rice was kinda meh in my opinion, but probably goes well with whatever sauce is on the rest of the dish you order. The spring roll was nothing special. I had the pineapple chicken, my friends had the sesame chicken and general tso chicken. Sesame chicken and general tso tasted pretty similar (though thats pretty common in chinese restaurants from my experience). All the chicken was cooked well and tasted good. Service was good, though it wasnt a busy night when I went so I dont know what its like when the server(s) are stretched out. I also ordered an egg fu young (big mistake, did not realize how much food this would be, could not even come close to eating all of it). The egg fu young was alright, Ive had better but it was far from inedible. I will probably go back again whenever Im craving chinese, unless I find someplace better for the price. My friends and I didnt have any of the more authentic stuff so we dont know what those are like, but it seems theyve got americanized chinese food down pat. Users/AndrewJacobs

20110304 21:23:48 nbsp I like this place and their food. They have good, if typical, prices for lunch specials, etc.
Only complaint is this: They say they give 10% discount for to go orders, then charge the full amount. I picked up lunch there today and had the back and forth: 10% off for to go, 5.75. Isnt it already 5.75 on the menu? Yes, but you get 10% off. Then he charged 5.75. Not that big a deal, but come on. Users/omgstarkitty

20110311 23:43:20 nbsp Just so you go in with the right expectation, the food isnt that great. I had the Lunch Buffet, but NONE of it was craveable. None of the condiments were great, either. Eh. But if youre really hungry, go for it!  Users/daviscatu8

20110320 04:07:58 nbsp been here once before, didnt like it. Wanted to try it again just in case it was a fluke that the food wasnt good... Im glad I tried again because I will never be coming back to this place again. The lunch buffet I tried makes Panada Express look like quality food and thats a feat all in itself. Its not like its cheap either at 8.98 per person during buffet. The fried rice was pretty bad (how can a Chinese restaurant mess up friend freakin rice). The brown rice was dry and extra chewy. Everything else you kinda want to just take a bite to try it and not return. I might sound like im too picky but if compared to Panda and this place is worse, then youve got problems. To each his own i guess... Users/C.Ling

20110509 00:29:01 nbsp I havent really tried their lunch buffet so I couldnt really comment although I really like their lunch specials. Usually they give you quite a bit of food and they do make the stuff fresh. They also give you a discount when you do take outs, but sometimes they just omit the tax in lieu of the discount, which is reasonable to me (maybe this is why some people have been complaining here?)
So far so good I would say. Although they dont give you as much food as Jade Garden, the stuff here is less greasy and salty... :) Users/Wiiman

20110509 11:09:51 nbsp Looking at the new menu uploaded today  does this mean they no longer have lunch specials and you can just order anything off the menu? Clarification would be helpful. Thanks! Users/Ravyn

20110513 20:12:47 nbsp Sorry about that. They apparently are in the process of changing the menus and I am trying to grab the latest version of it. The latest version of it (with all of the pages) should be up now. Users/Wiiman

20110513 23:40:45 nbsp I was writing a comment about their good food. But now I am really hungry cause of the pics... Damn it all. :( Users/Dozer

20110518 13:38:43 nbsp I went there because I like the egg foo young pancakes but they dont have them anymore. The menu is smaller and they have General Chicken but no General Tsos chicken. No lemon chicken either! The buffet price has gone up to 9.75 out the door, used to be only 6.00, so for that reason, I wont be going there again. The water they give you is heavily fluoridated and smells of chlorine. The food they did have was OK so if you like Chinese its not a bad place.   Users/cjsg
  In general (hehe), wiki:wikipedia:General Tsos chicken General Chicken is just another of many, many names for the dish also called General Tsos Chicken.  It varies quite a bit as well.  Is the General Chicken here not the same as what youd expect?  Its just a name for sweet and spicy chicken.  ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵

20110522 20:19:37 nbsp I had heard bad things about the food before, but my recent experience was good. I think the new management improved the food. Users/twblalock

20110524 23:17:49 nbsp I can never decide if I like Great Wall of China or Hunan better (friendlier staff and larger portions at Great Wall, but I feel like the food at Hunan is usually slightly better). However, Great Wall of China has one great thing going for it the lunch buffet. Its reasonably priced and theres a good variety of food.   Users/KianaFreitas

20111017 12:52:08 nbsp I have been there twice since the change of ownership, and will probably not head back. They have changed their hot and sour soup recipe to the point it seems to have no flavor, and getting three to four cups at a lunch visit used to be a main reason for going. Users/DCWine

20111025 19:01:28 nbsp I continue to believe (and have for 15 years) that this is the best Chinese food in town.  Generous portions and good service too~ Users/toriac

20120815 21:37:32 nbsp I noticed that this place hasnt been open and the interior has been gutted recently. Is this restaurant departed? Hope it isnt; enjoyed the buffet Users/MikeFolf

20120826 14:17:49 nbsp Its official.  Great Wall of China II has closed.  I dropped by in early August and they were closed for vacation for 10 days.  Went by today (8/26/12) and it was gutted inside, with a sign indicating a Mexican restaurant is moving in. Im so bummed.  I loved their buffet.  Lot of great memories.  If the owners happen to read this, thanks for all the great food. You will be missed.  Users/MichaelMacIntosh
