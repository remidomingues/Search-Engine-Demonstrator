The Piedbilled Grebe is a Waterbirds waterbird that can be seen year around swimming along the Arboretum waterway and sinking under water to escape predators and search for food. The stripe along its bill is a very distinctive characteristic of this species, but disappears at certain times of year.  Their silhouette is always the same.

Piedbilled grebes are rarely seen on land or flying overhead. They build floating nests out of sticks and are fiercely territorial. When nesting, a piedbilled grebe will not hesitate to chase the much larger Canada goose away from its floating nest.
