 History 

Nina & Tom started selling political shirts at the Davis Farmers Market in the spring of 2004.  They quickly expanded their business to include a whole line of clothing for kids with organic cotton shirts and onesies proclaiming I eat my vegetables and Im the big sister.  All of their products were made in the USA.   They sold local, handcrafted, and/or lowproduction goods, supporting small and independent businesses throughout the United States. There were purses, dolls, books, wallets, jewelery, and many other unique items.

Their stores Grand Opening took place October 10th, 2008.
