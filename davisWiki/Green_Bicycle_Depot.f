20120117 13:21:33 nbsp This place rocks. Got a set of pedals and toe clips for a great deal, and the guys working there were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Not to mention theyre cool to just talk to! Overall, I highly recommend the Green Bicycle Depot. Go there next time you need any bike parts or a whole bike and dont want to pay through the nose. Users/SeanRaley

20120125 20:12:32 nbsp Luv all the old bikes.  I wanted a commuter type bike, but didnt want the big price tag of a new one.  And, since Im a diehard recyler, I felt like I should be reusing something that was perfectly good.  So, while googling used bikes I happened upon this place thru Davis wiki & their FB page.  Tho I was initially interested in another bike that Id seen on FB, I ended up trying a few, and decided on a 1970 Schwinn Ladies Suburban (I looked up the SN later).  They were very helpful and patient, and more than willing to change parts if I wanted.  I ended up leaving mine as is.  I also traded in a bike I had.  Thx, I will enjoy my bike. Users/sherrillstone

20120128 13:40:52 nbsp Just bought an awesome used road bike that is in great condition! This place really makes you feel comfortable buying a bike and the guys are very helpful and honest about their merchandise. Everything is reasonably priced and I would highly recommend it to a friend!  Users/Omri

20120129 23:34:51 nbsp This place is AMAZING....a hole in the wall and glad its there! I am a student always looking for a good deal, found this place when getting my car tune up. I have been looking for a bike for a while but couldnt really afford one that I liked. So when I saw this place I thought it wouldnt hurt to check it out though I was skeptical because I thought used bikes would be in bad shape and hard to find a good fit since I am petite. But i was wrong, not only did i find the perfect size bike, but it was an original Releigh in perfect shape. The owner was so kind, and very informative on exactly what i needed and was looking for. He had reasonable prices and affordable compared to other bike shops in the area. I am a huge supporter of mom and Pop shops and this place definitely gets 5 stars, hands up! Recently, I got to ride my bike and I got a flat tire, I went back to the shop and I got it fixed in no time and I even got to borrow a lock until I can afford to buy a new one!
If you are looking for a good deal not only on bikes, but parts, and accessories this is the place to come to and SUPPORT!
Amazing place!  Users/GYani

20120131 20:11:48 nbsp I recommend this place. The owner is sometimes a little hard to understand because of his accent, but he really knows his stuff, wont upsell you, and is willing to spend time talking and making sure youre happy with your bike. I left with more bike knowledge and a feeling that Id helped support local business and the real Green movement. Users/BrettAnneBalamuth

20120206 20:42:03 nbsp I had a great experience buying my bike here last week.  The shop owner, Nelson, is super helpful and knowledgeable.
I had been in a couple of other wellknown bike shops in town.  Both of which really didnt seem to want to spend much time with me to help me find a good beginner bike.  When I walked into Green Bicycle Depot, I felt much more comfortable asking questions and having a conversation about what I wanted. I ended up buying a used bike that has suited my needs perfectly!  The folks at Green Bicycle Depot are there to help you!   Users/JEFROX

20120226 16:26:23 nbsp This place is pretty cool. Plus the people working there are super nice. I went in for a new old bike because my old bike was falling apart. The owner was very patient and helpful, going through a lot of trouble pulling out bike after bike that he thought I might like. Also, they dont make you uncomfortable if youre taking some time to think things through. Didnt push for the more expensive bikes, just stuck with your price range and try to figure out the best solution. Overall it was a great shopping experience and I walked away with a great old road bike. You wont be disappointed there. Users/JessicaLin

20120302 18:31:08 nbsp Just got an awesome womens vintage Colombia cruiser here! Its super clean. I wouldnt buy a bike anywhere else in Davis. The mechanics were super nice, helpful and friendly and let me try a number of bikes to make sure I got the right one. They had suggestions for what styles were good but didnt try to pressure me into any certain one. Great service and great selection of vintage bikes. If their green ideas dont get there, the service and quality of their work definitely will! Users/KatieAnderson

20120303 16:13:42 nbsp This place is AMAZZZINNNGGGG!!!! please support this mom and Pop shop. I bought a bike last year which I am suppper happy with. Recently, I had a tire problem I went to the owner and asked if he could fix it, he knows I am on a tight budget and a student. So after he took his time looking to see the problem was and he decided to put in new tires. When I got ready to figure out my payment plan or if I could pay half and come back later to pay the rest his response was, dont worry about it! Owners or people like this are rare he was concerned for my well being and was glad I didnt get into an accident. He mentioned if I had problems again to come back or call him so that he can help. I am not saying that he will give me or everyone something free every time BUT his integrity and passion to help students or his clients is what wins my business. And every time that I have gone in there he is never trying to take advantage or sell me anything. I see his sincerity and honesty. I will continue to come here for my repair needs and future bike purchases. I HIGHLY RECOMend! Users/GYani

20120331 09:20:30 nbsp This place fantastic! If youre in need of a bike for a decent price these guys will patiently help you find the bike thats the right fit for you. The owner is super friendly and will make sure you are happy with your bike, that also means fixing it for you if something goes wrong later. One huge perk about this place for me was that they helped me sell my old bike. He took it off my hands on consignment, let me set my price and called me once it was sold. Easy! Also, if you need accessories you can talk to the owner about what youre looking for and hell get you a good price for it. Please please please visit this spot!  Users/ChristineMeeuwsen

20120403 19:48:10 nbsp Awesome place! The people who work there are VERY friendly & helpful! They were more than willing to fix my bike after the chain broke, and the owner even offered me cookies as I waited for the repairs to be finished :) The best bike shop in Davis!!  Users/JessicaElizabeth

20120615 16:39:06 nbsp I got $150 of work done here in just a few hours and am so so glad I came here. I think I would have paid way more at another bike shop. When I bought a bike light they even insisted on installing it for me too, on the spot. You can tell that the owner takes pride in being helpful and honest.  Users/kelseycee

20120626 15:57:55 nbsp Love this place.  Large and interesting selection of old bikes.  Nelson, the owner, is knowledgeable and fun to talk to.  Tell him what youre looking for and hes happy to pull out some bikes and show them to you.

As of a couple of weeks ago they only take cash, so come prepared. Users/keraunoscopia

UPDATE:  Nope!  Was there Saturday and they take credit cards (20120922).  AlanMiller

20120705 16:56:40 nbsp Highest recommendation to purchase and fix your bikes here. Nelson helped me pick out a bike and also helped me learn how to ride a bike! He even helped us look for our lost car keys! He was very honest, informative, and very helpful. Nelson honestly gave us all the information on the bike we were buying, and also gave it to us for a really good price. The other workers there were friendly as well. Go here for all your bike repairs and inquiries and you wont regret it!!! Users/MaryDee

20120815 10:51:43 nbsp Beware of this place when you are buying a bike.  I went there looking for a particular kind of bike.  He has none of them marked.  Small Asian man helped me.  When I asked him how much a particular bike was, he thought for a moment, and pulled some price out of the air. When I researched the prices of this bike, the new version was cheaper. He did not appear to appreciate that before pricing the bikes, he should find a comparable based on age and make.  If you are still inclined to buy from there, DO YOUR HOMEWORK before you pay what hes asking. Users/DavisLurker

20120928 19:09:31 nbsp My new favorite bike shop in Davis. Theres nowhere else thats this reliable, affordable and friendly.

Had a really good experience here. I came to get my wheel trued and a new rack. The owner fixed my wheel right away and added a missing screw, then showed me a great $15 used rack that would work with my bikes frame and vintage feel. At least 20 minutes or work were put into my bike and he only charged my $5 for labor.

Overall the people here are really nice and clearly care about the Davis community and reusing old bikes (which is great for the environment and your wallet.) Users/ArielMarek

20121212 16:49:03 nbsp This place is awesome!  For a bike nerd this place has so much gems sitting around, its like a treasure hunt.  When you see a pink Derosa and other bike porn worthy stuff sitting around, I knew this is the place I want to come back.  A pink Derosa, Colnago, Davidson and a Coppi is not something you see normally even for a bike shop these days.
Perhaps its my personal belief in reducing redundant production in an already overabundant market, I dont believe theres much of a reason to buy a new bike made with junk quality aluminum when you can buy a slightly old but still good to ride steel bike.  For a bike older than 10 years to be still running today should be a statement itself.  The Green Bicycle Depot looked like it had so much good old steel bikes ready to go with a variety in brands and sizing.  If I was new in town, this is the place I would buy my bike except that already own handful of bikes.
Plus who has a box full of Suntour derailleurs and other cool stuff sitting around. Users/SteelisReal

20130221 18:33:34 nbsp I literally just got a bike there. I didnt know anything about bikes and it left me really vulnerable to getting cheated or taken advantage of. I checked this place out at the recommendation of my roommate, and I couldnt be happier. He gave me the whole story about department store bikes and everything, but showed me all different kinds. Didnt really pressure me into one. I ended up getting a road bike, that is clearly used but everything looks brand new as far as all of the cables and such (see what I mean, I know nothing about bikes). I didnt have a way to get it home (I live pretty far from the shop), so he delivered it for me. I tried to give him money for delivering it, and he refused. All around, he said he just wanted to educate me on bikes even if I didnt buy anything. Really an honest guy that Id recommend to anyone. Yes, I ended up spending more than I wanted to, but Im confident the bike is really sturdy and that if anything goes wrong, I can bring it back there and they will take care of it. I also like that I wasnt contributing to our throw away society by buying a brand new department store bike. Id highly recommend this place. Users/MeggM

20130321 15:31:34 nbsp I was in a bike accident on campus recently. My front wheel was bent and the inner tube and tire had torn. I called around to every bike shop in town and Green Bicycle Depot had the best prices. Not only that, but the owner was extremely friendly over the phone. He was also extremely helpful when I arrived at the shop. He showed me the replacement parts that he would be using and suggested that I examine my old inner tube to see if it was useable. It wasnt, but the suggestion alone showed me how noncommercial the staff was. Overall the shop is well run and the workers are extremely friendly and professional. 5/5. Will return. Users/Quinnb

20130830 18:02:21 nbsp This place is great, went in the Friday before classes starting for a tune up and they had the bike ready within a few hours. They even offered to help me load the bike into my car. I will defiantly be going back. Users/WilliamKinderman

20130912 16:05:42 nbsp Recommended. I picked up a nice new unmarked Marin here (an older model demo?). After a days riding around town, however, I discovered the pedals were not tightened properly when one pedal came loose after stripping out the crank. Of course, I took the bike back right away. Though they thought it wasnt their fault (Im sure this was a simple mistake), they replaced the crank with a new one, giving me another bike to use for a day as they fixed it. Overall great experience when things didnt go perfectly. Neat place! Users/DavidRheinheimer

20140209 16:51:22 nbsp Yes, the bikes are decent. However, I went to this bike shop after purchasing a bike from them to fix the chain and some check ups. The owner was kind enough to fix them for me, but not quite kind enough to fix the break that was somehow loosen after I brought the bike to him. I noticed the break when I biked to work after picking up the bike, and I had to wait until after work to take the bike back to the place for a second fix. On my way to them, I fall, due to the loosen break, and had 12 stitches on my lip, 3 stitches on my chin and multiples scars on face and knees. The biggest scar among them all, is my confidence in green bicycle depot.  Users/sophiewang

20140225 12:10:49 nbsp I recommend this bike shop. Its a little hidden, but Im glad I found it when I was looking for a bike for my girlfriend. The selection of bikes that Nelson (owner) had was surprisingly large. Although their bikes are a little older than what youll find new at B&L or other shops in Davis, the bikes at GBD are maintained to tiptop shape and will outlast the newer (but cheaper made) bikes. They were very patient and explained to me the pros and cons of each type of bike. Never at any point did I feel pressured to buy the bike. I ended up with a smallsized road bike for my girlfriend that I got at a great price. The bike was even sold with brand new tires and brake cables/housing. Ive brought other bikes here for maintenance/replacement parts and the quality of work has been top notch. Their shop is also very clean and organized, and the owner is a very down to earth guy. They also live up to their name. I asked Nelson what he does with all the frames/bikes that dont sell after a long time, and he told me he brings them to metal recycling plants where they melt them down to be reused. I would highly recommend this shop to those looking to purchase a bike or just for repairs/parts.  Users/MikeyH

20140409 17:27:26 nbsp This bike shop is absolutely phenomenal. I came in looking to get a nice used bike to replace on that was stolen, and the owner just took his time showing me all the kinds of road bike they had. He talked about the pros and cons of each one, and let me test all of the ones I looked at. I never felt any pressure to buy, and the owner really has a lot of enthusiasm about his bikes. I would definitely recommend this place. Users/JohnUhrig

20140417 15:46:59 nbsp Good: Friendly staff, reasonably priced parts including used ones, lots of options.
Notsogood: When I had a flat fixed here, I noticed that the tube was too long and had to wrinkle up in order to fit, but they assured me it wasnt anything to worry about. However, when the tire went flat months later, the leak occurred right where it was scrunched up, under extra stress. Not a huge deal and I now know tubes arent always perfect fits, but it was a pretty significant mismatch. This, in combination with other little things (like a rear rack installed in front of my reflector) makes me torn between really liking this place and doubting whether the friendly, green factors balance out the details. Users/kayjayarr

20140712 14:25:13 nbsp This store is excellent. Nelson is super knowledgable and helpful and seems very genuine. He took time out to talk to me about different bikes and find which was best for me and my needs. Excellent selection, prices and customer service. I will definitely be going back and will recommend it to friends!  Users/Skerri

20140801 15:46:26 nbsp Maybe my experience would have been better if I had dealt with the ownerthe comments here seem to be unilaterally in his favorbut I didnt have that pleasure. I dealt with a shop attendant who spoke the most broken English Ive ever heard. I honestly think I would have understood him better if hed been speaking his native tongue. I hope this doesnt come across as racist or xenophobic or anything; I grew up in a military family and Ive dealt with international students and their families my entire life. Ive never had so much trouble understanding someone as I did today speaking to the shop attendant at Green Bicycle Depot. Perhaps hes family of the owner, because I cant imagine anyone in their right mind would hire him to deal with Englishspeaking customers.

My other complaint is the prices. They werent too high, they just werent there. Out of the hundred plus bikes there, I saw two with price tags. When I asked for prices on certain bikes, the shop attendant seemed to be making it up on the spot. He wanted $80 for a beatenup mountain bike which still needed repairs and probably didnt cost $80 new.

Im going to head back another time and see if the owner can show me around, because my experience was totally out of line with the rest of the comments here. Users/TBrown

In a city with more bikes than people, the Green Bicycle Depot is awesome for its forwardthinking and customerfirst approach.

For one, buying used bicycles is an environmentally friendly idea that the city of Davis should not only be proud of, but more attentive to, especially if it wants to consider itself as exemplary for sustainability. For another, Nelson and Ronaldo (the shops duo) are stand up guys. As a friendly heads up, while Nelson usually manages the shop and its sales, Ronaldos the handyman and fixer upper. Generally, this set up will see Nelson at the front of the store with Ronaldo working on stuff in the back. But every now and then when Nelson might be busy with another customer or an errand, Ronaldo will cover. In truth, sales arent really his thing, but they dont have to be: hes still a cool guy to chat with while waiting to make a deal with Nelson (the owner).

More importantly, as a visitor to the shop for nearly two years, I can say that these guys have not failed to help me even once throughout my many visits. Check them out, and youll gain a valuable resource in the DVILLE! Users/JimmyRecinos
