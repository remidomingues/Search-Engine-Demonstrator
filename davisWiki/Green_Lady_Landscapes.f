Green Lady Landscapes is a local Landscaping landscaping and Landscape Design landscape design service.



20120323 09:47:20 nbsp We recently used Jessica for a landscape design. She is friendly and personable. But I strenuously recommend that before using her for a landscape design or the actual landscaping work that you get everything in writing. AND I MEAN EVERYTHING! What services you want, how much the design/sketch will cost, timeframe for getting you the design/sketch, what it should consist of, cost of the design, if she would be willing to make revisions, how many plants to include (1 tree or 3 trees, small trees or large trees, varying heights of plants, types of plants, different colors, different bloom times, drought tolerant, etc), clustering of plants, walking space around plants, hard or softscaping, etc. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY  how much YOU are willing to pay. By having all of this in writing, above crystal clear communication with Jessica, hopefully you have a good experience. Users/jgroveman
