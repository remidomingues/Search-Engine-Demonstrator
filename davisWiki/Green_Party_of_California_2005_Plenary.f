Two or three times during the year the Green Party of California (GPCA) gathers to make decisions that decide the direction of the party. This event is internally referred to as a state plenary. In the summer of 2005, the University of California, Davis was chosen as the site of its next plenary (which would occur on December 1011, 2005). As such, the Davis College Green Party and the Green Party of Yolo County are cohosting this plenary.

The structure of the Green Party of California is divided up among state counties. Each county Green Party is alloted a certain number of delegates based upon the number of registered Greens in the county. When a state plenary occurs, each county Green Party sends their delegates to the plenary. All of these county delegates from across the state form the General Assembly for that specific state plenary. It is the duty of the General Assembly to make important decisions for the state party and this is what will occur on December 10 and 11.

To find out more specifics about this event, visit the http://www.cagreens.org/plenary/ GPCA Plenary website.

Since the Green Party is a grassroots party, we are always looking for local volunteers to help out. While nonvolunteers who attend this event have to pay the registration fees, individuals who do volunteer can attend the event for free. Breakfast and lunch are provided. You can also meet and mingle with people such as Peter Camejo (former candidate for California governor), Matt Gonzalez (former President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and almostmayor of San Francisco), Forrest Hill (candidate for California Secretary of State), and many more important Green figures.

If you would like to get involved, please contact Users/JonathonLeathers or just post a comment on this page.
