Green Planet was a downtown hangout that served smoothies and juice. It went bankrupt after the opening of Davis Commons, where Jamba Juice is located. Ciocolat now occupies the space where Green Planet was.


Green Planet Juicery served up incredible smoothies and wraps during the mid to late 1990s.  The wraps were particularly good, and often Green Planet would include 2for1 wrap coupons in The California Aggie.
