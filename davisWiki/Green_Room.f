The Green Room can be found in Wright Hall, which houses the Theatre and Dance Department of Theatre and Dance. While most performance venues have a socalled green room for performers to prepare in, the one at the UC Davis Main Theatre Main Stage is the only one in the Davis area to have capital letters. Officially the place where performers do final checkups before appearing on stage, the Green Room in Wright Hall also serves as a sort of student lounge. The Green Room was repainted in the summer of 2005 and now actually has two green walls.

Green Room conversation is notoriously risqu√©, being as it is the collected utterances of a bunch of drama geeks. There was, briefly, a posted tally sheet for Inappropriate Remarks in Fall of 2005; the tally reached the midthirties before being mysteriously removed, less than 48 hours after being posted.

The Green Room also houses The Boxes, a wall of mailboxes assigned to the various undergraduate students in the department. They are used as a means of contact, a temporary storage space for nonhazardous items smaller than a breadbox, and a badge of (dubious) honor.
