Green Sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) are found in most Sacramento River drainages and the Arboretum Waterway. Because of the poor clarity, it is difficult to spot Greenies in the Waterway. Rest assured they are indeed there. They are a minor gamefish in the sunfish family and rarely attain sizes beyond 7 inches. Fun to Fishing catch on light gear, they will accept most small live baits. Greenies can tolerate pretty turbid and muddy water which allows them to exist in a wide range of conditions. They feed primarily on aquatic insects and small mollusks and crustaceans.

I used to think there were only carp and mosquitofish, but last summer we pulled a few up from the bridge around the australian collection. They were much smaller than most of the ones you will find in Putah Creek.  Users/CarlosOverstreet
