In addition to the curbside pickup of garbage and recycling recyclables in the City of Davis City, Davis Waste Removal also picksup green waste.

Curbside pickup of yard odors waste:

  Yard waste, or green waste such as landscape prunings and grass, can simply be piled on the street. Acceptable materials for disposal include: grass clippings, brush, leaves, prunings, weeds, discarded floral displays, indoor plants, branches (less than 8 inches in diameter), and Christmas trees.
  Do not place yard waste in a plastic bag or any other container.
  Piles should be no more than 5x5x5, but residents can create as many piles as needed.
   Apartment complexes (well, their gardeners) frequently ignore this rule, leaving absolutely enormous piles.
  Davis Waste Removal collects yard materials once a week, usually the day before trash pickup.  They will only pickup yard material piles that are located directly in front of a house. Do not place your yard material pile across the street or around the corner from your house—it will not be picked up!
  Place your yard material 18” from the curb or gutter.
  Please be sure that your pile does not block fire hydrants, driveways, or sidewalks.
  Do not park you car on top of yard waste piles (this may seem like a silly reminder, but heypeople actually do this!)
  Be aware that your yard material piles can create serious hazards for cyclists; bike lanes should never be blocked.
  Please do not place sod, soil, concrete, fruit, flowerpots, florist wire, fencing, bricks, or stumps in yard material piles.  Try composting your fruit yourself.
  Please be aware that logs and wood building materials are not considered yard waste!

Street sweeping occurs every week, usually the day following brush pickup. In order to take advantage of this service, please park your car off street on your sweeping day. Check out the http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/residents/singlefamily/curbsidepickupinformation Street Sweeping Map to find out what day your streets are swept.

Before the yard waste pickup schedules changed, it was recommended that In order to coordinate the brush pickup and street sweeping service; brush is picked up on a Monday through Thursday basis. Please put your yard refuse out for collection on the day before your regular garbage day. (If your regular garbage day is Wednesday, put your brush out for Tuesday pickup).  Now you should see the http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/residents/singlefamily/curbsidepickupinformation Yard Material PickUp Map to determine your yard material pickup day.


Davis Waste Removal uses a combination of a Front End Loaders loader and a rear load garbage truck to pick up the green waste.

If you dont want to leave your http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/yardmaterial yard material out in the street for pickup, or if you have a lot of fruits and veggies (which are not allowed in piles on the street), try backyard composting. The City of Davis Public Works Department offers a free compost correspondence course for Davis residents. Davis residents in single family homes can purchase a compost bin for $10 when they complete the course. Call the Public Works Department at 7575686 to sign up.

A lady from the East coast who was living in town once stopped me while I was mowing a lawn and asked me why everyone was putting out piles of clippings and grass. She was rather amazed to find out that the city collected them. Ive always fancied using one of the loaders in some sort of action movie sequence, they just look cut out for something like that... albiet they are a tad on the slow side  Users/StevenDaubert

When I first arived in Davis, I was confused as hell as to why there were giant piles of green waste everywhere. Then I saw the machine that picked up the green waste. Man, that thing is terrifying.  Users/ArlenAbraham

20080430 17:32:08 nbsp These piles often block the bike lanes.  This creates quite a hazard, as cyclists have to move very close to, or into, the street to dodge them.  Dodging them at night is particularly dangerous, as even with a good bike light, they may not be visible in time, nor may the car behind the dodging cyclist. Users/IDoNotExist

20080430 17:52:52 nbsp I would imagine that the new lines being painted designate a bike lane and a green waste lane, at least as far as Ive seen in North Davis. I find it hard to believe that a conscientious biker has much of problem avoiding the piles anyway, as the only time Ive ever hit one was at night, while drunk, and not using a bike light.

20090117 21:08:25 nbsp I have lived in several cities on both the east and west coast and I have NEVER seen a more absurd system than this one for green waste.  I have scrapes in the road from the loader, it leaves a bunch of stuff behind every week (and no, the street sweeper doesnt get it all), and there is this strange force called wind that blows the leaves from everyones piles down the street.  How beautiful the green plastic bin I used to have now seems... Users/amccoy

20090410 12:24:42 nbsp Does anyone know WHERE they take the yard waste, and if it is possible to go get some to use on my garden? THANKS! Users/ChelseaAyers

20091116 10:03:27 nbsp Re: Where do they take the yard waste?  I just spoke to DWR, it turns out that they currently bury the yard waste in the landfill.  This is because of the agricultural quarantine on Yolo county, caused by the apple moth. Users/RobiPochapin

201015 Actually, this is incorrect. With the exception of a couple of days a few months ago, the material is still being composted, its just chipped first. Users/jgilbert


20091116 16:09:35 nbsp In San Jose, the city gives you this huge yard waste container.

I actually rode through one of these piles. It was midnight on a Friday, and instead of biking drunk I was biking home after playing some Friday Night Magic. Users/hankim

20130214 00:24:56 nbsp Ah, green waste. Its not so much fun when you slam into a huge chunk of tree during a foggy night that somebody left in the bike lane...  Users/HarrisonM
