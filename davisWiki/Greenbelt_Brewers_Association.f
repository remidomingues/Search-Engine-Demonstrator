Greenbelt Brewers Association is a Homebrew Club for the Brew your own beer home brewing aficionado (or beginner) in the Davis and surrounding areas. We are an AHA recognized club dedicated to the joy of home brewing. We are almost 50 members now with people from Yolo, Solano, Sacramento and Eldorado Counties.

This club was started in an effort to expand knowledge, share ideas, learn new techniques, and educate others about the craft of homebrewing. Whether you are new to  brewing, or have been brewing since the days of prohibition, all are welcome. So come on in, pour a pint, and we look forward to seeing you at the next meeting.

We currently hold meetings on the 3rd Tuesday of every month at 6:30 PM at Sudwerk Brewery in Davis, CA.  Please Contact Us for more information if you are interested in coming to a meeting and or joining the club.

A typical meeting usually features a presentation on a brewing style or technique.  The presentations are usually given by a club member and we try to invite guest speakers at least twice a year. The meetings are also a great opportunity to share homebrew and get feedback on your brew.
