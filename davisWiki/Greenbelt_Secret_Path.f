The Greenbelt Secret Path is an alternate connecting path with more natural landscaping between the southwest end of the Perimeter Greenbelt and the southern end of the Senda Nueva Greenbelt.  While not really a secret, it is at least hidden in plain sight.  At the south end of the perimeter, a row of redwoods extends east between a gap in the fences just south of the entrance to Falcon Avenue.  At its south entrance, there is a dirt path that empties onto a small patch of grass just east of the entrance to Hacienda Avenue.  Along the way between houses, the path crosses Valencia, Pamplona and Hacienda Avenues.
