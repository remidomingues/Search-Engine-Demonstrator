20100828 09:12:24 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  Are you aware that the IP address used to make each edit is saved and freely visible to everyone?  Its good that you really like Blisworks Bikes, but leaving multiple comments under Users/Deej different user names is pretty high on the shadiness factor scale.  Sockpuppet Sockpuppetry is frowned upon here.  Might I suggest closing out the fake accounts, making a new one using your actual identity, and getting a fresh start? Users/TomGarberson
