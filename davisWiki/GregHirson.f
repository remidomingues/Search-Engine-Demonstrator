Greg is a Masters student in the Viticulture and Enology at UC Davis. As such, he very much enjoys drinking wine. There are, however, other things that interest Greg. Among them are:

Food
Photography
Antonia Oakley
Tilden Cash, his black lab mix
Gardening

Greg often does not have time for the aforementioned interests (other than Antonia and Tilden), as he is busy learning about grapes and yeast and various and sundry winerelated concepts.

20110315 10:28:57 nbsp Is there a way to get that neat map of the teaching winery up with the RMI information? Itd be cool to have it accessible for visitors... I just dont know if theyd be cool with it. I saw it on the Good Life blog, http://ucdavisgoodlifegarden.blogspot.com/2011/03/isawsign.html. Cheers! Users/ChristyMarsden
