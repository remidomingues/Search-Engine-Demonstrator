20080217 18:40:39 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Wow, that was an impressive restructuring of Music Teachers. Thanks for the effort. Users/JasonAller

20081101 20:24:57 nbsp I took MAT 21B from you in Winter 2006. Its nice to see you make such substantial contributions to the wiki. If I remember correctly, you had a really awesome recumbent. Still riding it? Users/WilliamLewis

20081101 20:26:34 nbsp I have a different recumbent now which is even more awesome.  Anyway thanks for your interest.  If you can help with the Bicycle Hazards page, that would be great. Users/GregKuperberg

20081104 14:37:27 nbsp There are a couple ways to fix it, but the best way would involve using the {{{Address()}}} macro so the points youre highlighting in the entry map automatically via Google Maps and the upcoming new mapping system. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081205 21:22:06 nbsp Thanks for all of your recent edits. Please Remember to Preview, and also to try to not remove links. The edit to Froggys for example removed the link to The Paragon. Users/JasonAller

20081205 22:04:11 nbsp But the Paragon is a dead link and a dead establishment.
 Users/GregKuperberg

20081205 22:41:11 nbsp The only reason the link was dead is that no one has yet created a page for the Paragon. There is an entire page devoted to listing all of the wanted pages on the wiki. Users/JasonAller

20081205 22:51:35 nbsp Is it important to create a page for a bar thats been gone for five years?  Im not understanding this.
 Users/GregKuperberg

20081205 22:57:58 nbsp Capturing history is important to some wiki users. Thus departed businesses and other pages like history. Users/JasonAller

20081206 15:00:00 nbsp In general, the wiki is a resource about Davis, a town that includes many many years worth of people, places and things that no longer exist.  Some editors are slowly working through adding historical entries devoted to things from decades (or just years) ago.  Theres plenty of room. Users/JabberWokky

20081206 15:13:32 nbsp Okay, capturing history is important.  But a better system would be to use searches to see what to link when you make a new page, than to keep a lot of dead links.

As for preview, the quick edit feature is much easier for me when I edit long pages.  But it has no preview feature.
 Users/GregKuperberg
   Creating dead links adds the subject to Wanted Pages, where editors can go to find things to write about.  The problem that Jason is talking about regarding preview is that lots of quick edits makes it very difficult for others to review your edits and see what you have done.  Its up to you, of course, and editing is preferable to not editing... its just that it fills up the Recent Changes entry with loads of little changes that are hard to follow.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081206 15:41:36 nbsp 1) If you remove the last dead link to something, does it then disappear from the wanted page?

2) I would be quite happy to preview and even happier to notate some of my changes.  But this is really more difficult to do in the WikiSpot software than it is in MediaWiki.  Although even then, Im never going to be all that great with these practices, because I have an ingrained habit of fiddling with text.
 Users/GregKuperberg
  Weve been bugging Users/PhilipNeustrom for a comment bar for quick edits since the feature came out. I think it is part of his conspiracy to get more coders onboard wiki:sycamore Project Sycamore. He might just figure we might want it so badly that someone will break down and write the patch. wl
  1) Yes.  2) Theres a different ebb and flow with Wiki Spot than with MediaWiki.  Sort of like how the conventions and traditions between Wikipedia and Davis Wiki are radically different (primary sources are encouraged, well written creative writing is celebrated, POV is aggregated, not neutral etc).  One of the things that dwiki gnomes tend to do is sit on Recent Changes and watch to assist and expand new topics.  Personally, I dont care much about the Preview thing, but I know others do, and thats why.  If you always edited with quick edits every day from now on, that would fine by me... it just bugs some editors.  It really isnt that big a dealFootnote(Disclaimer: The size of the deal may vary by editor, I am not responsible if somebody else considers it a big deal).  I can attest that Im waiting until youre completely finished (at least for awhile) with the edits on Tragic Events so I can go back and see what you did.  jw

20081206 15:34:43 nbsp By the way, dont feel anybody is picking on you or telling you youre wrong.  Were just trying to work with you.  Yknow  the whole editors working together.  The wiki has various tools and traditions that have evolved over the years.  Now that youre editing so much (which is appreciated!), youre just now part of the incessant editor back and forth.  Looking back on the comments you have gotten, I just didnt want you thinking everybody is being down on you.  The comments youve gotten are intended to be practical feedback about how things have worked out and how most other editors work together.  So dont feel shy about explaining your rationale or asking why do people do it this way?.  Often (like with the Wanted Pages entry), there are wiki tools that have shaped how people edit so that other editors can collaborate with them.  Were all just working together.  Once again, thanks for jumping in with all the editing! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081214 12:26:13 nbsp The formatting on the tragic events page is rather hard to read at the moment.  Maybe the descriptions could be indented? Users/IDoNotExist

20081214 13:01:12 nbsp Greg, I saw your comment on Tragic Events and agree about the short forms versus full names. When I start playing with the page again, Ill adjust as needed. Users/DavidRobinson

20081214 18:58:50 nbsp Greg, Although civil dates in this country are given in the form of month, day, and  year, the genealogical convention is to go from the smallest increment to the largestday, month, and year. That is the style accepted by the NEHGS and the NGS. I didnt change any event dates on the Tragic Events page from the conventional format, since thats what most people expect and are used to, just the birth and death dates. I take it you found that problematical? Users/DavidRobinson
    Just to toss it out, a common date form used on the wiki is the wiki:wikipedia:ISO 8601 International Standard Date, or greatest to least: 20081214.  Youll note all comments are stamped with them.  There are several benefits (unambiguity, as there is no common Ydm use, sortability, accepted standard, ability to drop or increase precision, a la 200812), but the classic drawback is like that of metric units  it is less common than the classic form.  It does appear to be gaining popularity as we have increasingly international communication. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081214 20:52:38 nbsp I dont feel strongly about January 7, 1980 versus 7 January 1980.  My suggestion is the former because (1) its easier for me to read, not entirely sure why; and (2) its a standard (not necessarily the standard) for Wikipedia biographies, at least for biographies of Americans.  The format 19800107 is really significantly more difficult to read and I dont see that it makes sense in the main text, even though it isnt too bad in the comments section.

What I do care about rather more is to have a shorter title for each entry in Tragic Events.  But maybe were all in agreement on that one.
 Users/GregKuperberg

20100313 18:57:50 nbsp Hey, I just made an entry for Good Neighbor Lawn Care, if you have anything to add or correct. Users/JabberWokky

20100625 11:19:24 nbsp The part about the salary was not very crude but actually neutral and it described how others are paid more. Why delete it? Users/hankim

20100625 11:38:32 nbsp Hey, Greg... I created Linda Katehi/Talk to discuss the content on the entry about Ms. Katehi.  Im not sure why removing the historical note makes sense (presumably it will fade in prominence as she does more as a chancellor and that is added to her entry).  Users/JabberWokky

20100801 00:27:04 nbsp used as a pun no doubt? Marketplace ups died... its a bit early brah Users/StevenDaubert

20101205 17:12:03 nbsp On your easement comment, Im not sure if you were being witty/cynical/funny or that you really dont know what an easement is.  So bear with me.  A crossing is a physical thing.  An easement is a legal right to be on someone elses property.  There are a couple of different ways that a lawyer could argue that the public has an easement on UPs property and that the UP does not have a right to block them. Users/JimStewart

20110111 18:59:48 nbsp Law ! real world

you stick to your guns on the fence issue so tightly that I think your just trolling... Users/StevenDaubert

20111230 02:08:11 nbsp That set of entries is probably the most rearranged on the wiki. Users/JabberWokky

20111230 07:51:03 nbsp Im impressed with your commitment to those pages. Have you considered using table formating to better line up the month day year name columns?  Aesthetically, itd look nice/clean.  An example:



Users/EdWins

20111230 09:22:31 nbsp Yeah, that makes more sense spacing wise.  The above example looks a bit odd!
Two columns would http://daviswiki.org/Tragic_Events/By_Type?actiondiff&version26&version15 look like this.

Could probably copy everything to a word document, and do a few replace all.
  to ||
h  to ||h
  to ||
should cover placing the formatting for each line, I think, pretty quickly.
Users/EdWins

  I made it a twocolumn table.  It was a good suggestion. Users/GregKuperberg

20120601 20:44:01 nbsp Little Freudian slip there.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20120602 09:56:25 nbsp What you have for SG now is fine. Users/CovertProfessor

20120607 17:19:16 nbsp Yes on both counts. Perhaps chime in on the Talk page so that your view is more widely known.  Users/CovertProfessor

  I would otherwise be happy do it, but I have just been stirring too many pots lately.   Users/GregKuperberg
   I can empathize.  cp

20120613 20:59:44 nbsp Its fishy to me too, but its a better tactic then making new troll accounts and vandalizing the wiki out of spite.  Im willing to let it slide.  Users/EdWins ES
  I dont see much difference between what X the unknown is doing and vandalizing the wiki out of spite.  Okay, instead of vandalizing out of spite, he/she is whitewashing it in favor of a local business.  Users/GregKuperberg
   Whitewashing a business page is bad, and to my understanding the original edits to the business page were fixed by other wiki editors, which is what drew personXs attention in anger.  Whitewashing a user page is lame, but its never been a wiki stance to have people prove their username, and weve generally given people free reign with their own userpage (as opposed to a business or public person page).    At this point, to my count, the business page is edited to wiki standards, and personX simply deleted comments from their userpage.  Thats what I meant by letting it slide, overall its about as good of a win as we can get  unless we become punitive out of our own spite and try to force them to unveil their real life identify. clarifi ES
    I dont feel strongly about the issue, but my advice is that there is a difference between anonymity and fabrication, and especially impersonation of other people.  PersonX says, oh Im L. Wolk whos 90 years old, but people will still think that its Lois Wolk unless they know to check. But either personX will continue to create trouble, or not. Users/GregKuperberg
     I agree with everything that ES says, but one point of clarification: the edit that originally received the most ire was when I restored a complaint about the business that had been summarily deleted by jimi without any discussion.  I am still not happy with that deletion, but I seem to be alone in that, so I have not pursued the matter further.  As for LWolk being mistaken for Lois Wolk, that is why I put the explicit note on the page that LWolk was not Lois Wolk.  Or perhaps you are worried that people will not click through to the user page?  Users/CovertProfessor
      Obviously not everyone will click.  And, if the whole thing is a fabrication, then I dont think that X the unknown picked the name LWolk out of sheer coincidence.  It just looks like a lot of shenanigans, and I have the feeling that eventually the DavisWiki regulars will get tired of it.  But if not, then not, as I said, I dont care all that much.  Frankly there are other pages on DavisWiki that are rather worse than this case, because of an echo chamber of tendentious opinion.   Users/GregKuperberg
      One interesting historical note though:  Even in the days before clicking on links, people found ways to brazenly hide the truth in plain sight.  For instance, have you ever heard of an http://www.utlm.org/images/3dollarbill_antibank.jpg antibank?

20120615 08:35:50 nbsp The LWolk account is gone, and there is nothing to indicate that the W in ScarlettW is a Wolk.  Time to move on. Users/CovertProfessor

  No, the user explicitly referred to himself/herself as Scarlett Wolk, and claimed that L. Wolk is her mother.   Users/GregKuperberg
   I kinda agree with CP here, we should let the SW/LW stuff fizzle out.  The comments you left on the SW page could perpetuate an already drawnout argument.  Would it be ok if I removed the latest one?  JT
    The account LWolk was disabled for certain wellfounded reasons.  If the account ScarlettW were also disabled for the same reasons, then after that it could make sense to remove my comment. Users/GregKuperberg
     Kinda beating a dead horse though, yeah? JT
      Look, I dont feel at all in charge of DavisWiki and in the end, you guys can do what you want.  However, I am involved with another major userdriven web site, and there the policy is that when users become abusers, their accounts are disabled.  As in, all of them.  No good evidence has surfaced that LWolk and ScarlettW arent simply the same troublemaker, someone closely associated with Bowerbird and Dunaway.
     There is another dubious aspect to this as well.  A number of DavisWiki users are clearly eager to speak truth to power, especially corporate power, if that power happens to be the university or Union Pacific or US Bank.  But if its a local business that didnt land on the wrong side of ideology, then there is a sentiment is to compromise to keep everyone happy.  It doesnt look good.  Users/GregKuperberg
       Ok, well I dont care really.  If youre up to fighting it, go for it.  JT
