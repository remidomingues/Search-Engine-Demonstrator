20100531 15:17:44 nbsp @Greg  In your opinion, are all developers inherently greedy?   Users/KemblePope

20100601 18:05:03 nbsp No Kemble, just the most recent developers that Davis voters have had to defeat (Monfared, Whitcombe) Users/GregSokolov

20100607 13:05:22 nbsp @Greg  So, the developers who forced Mace Ranch on the city...  and the Wildhorse developers who gave us some great tract housing ... and then both promptly left town... theyre not greedy?  Is anyone in private business who seeks to make a profit considered greedy? Or is there a Sokolovthreshold for profit that triggers the ability to casually accuse people of being guilty of one of the seven deadly sins?

Why the character assassinations on people that you, obviously, dont know?  Why not stick to the issue that youd rather see no peripheral growth in Davis? Users/KemblePope
 I think that developments should be more like village homes, and not like mace ranch Daubert I dont view village homes as a greedy development

20100607 22:39:03 nbsp Kemble: Good luck on the work you will paid for consulting work on the next Covell Village development project. Users/GregSokolov
 There you go again!  Just cant stick to the issues can you?  Users/KemblePope

Greg, Im not sure DavisWiki is the place to air your issues with David Greenwald, the Vanguard, and so on.  Your anger toward him has little to do with Sydney Vergis.  Please bear in mind that the Wiki is not a personal blog. Users/TomGarberson
 I agree.  Im going to delete the parts from the Vergis page that are about Greenwald rather than Vergis.   Users/CovertProfessor
