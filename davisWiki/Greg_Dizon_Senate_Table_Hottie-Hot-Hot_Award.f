The Greg Dizon Senate Table HottieHotHot Award is a gag award established by Greg Dizon, the former chair of the ASUCD External Affairs Commission.

Selection Process
The public submits nominations to the Convener of the Award Selection Process, who is the sitting EAC Chair by precedent.  All nominations must be for people meeting the following requirements:
 1. Must be an a Senator or exofficio member of the Senate, or anyone who is able to sit at the Senate Table
 2. Must not be a deuce

The Convener of the Award Selection Process shall select two recipients from the nominations, using the following informal criteria:
 1. Diversity of outreach in UC Davis campus and the Davis Community
 2. Composure and patience during Senate meetings
 3. Hottiehothotness (The definition of this word still remains extremely ambiguous.)

CAVEAT: In no way do the terms Senate, Senate Table, Chair, Senator, any other variants or the general nature of the gag award imply the official support or endorsement of ASUCD, its units, or UC Davis.
