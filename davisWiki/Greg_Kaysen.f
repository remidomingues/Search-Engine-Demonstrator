The final show was February 26th (monday) at 9, Greg came in second place to a rapper named Shamrock.

He has been into performing hiphop since he was a teenager when he started to learn freestyle rap. He attended the University of California at Santa Cruz, but still found time to get involved in the hiphop scene in Davis and the Bay Area. He has performed in the past at the G Street Pub.

He is also an owner of a company called Ghetto Revival this has caused some sideways glances and angry looks from major hip hop artists who make cameos on the show. John Brown really hasnt explained what it is. Apparently its some sort of non profit that does charity work in the ghetto in an attempt to better (revive) the area. He also works with a record label that goes under the same name.
