20060128 17:28:27 nbsp I have been seeing this dentist for 20 years and Im always impressed with the quality of service, painfree treatments, depth of explainations, and friendly, knowledgable staff. MaggieBlank

20070124 13:16:54 nbsp I just went in today and the staff were SOOO nice! The front desk women were very helpful, the dental hygienist was great, and the dentist was happy to take time to explain things. I was worried about financing my dental care, as I recently chipped a tooth. They spent 30 minutes on the phone to get my insurance to cover a porcelain veneer. Their efforts will likely save me several hundred dollars! RachelCakes

20070727 19:01:41 nbsp Ive been seeing Dr. Wilcox for several years now and I really appreciate his excellent care, my hygienist Marsha, and the friendly office staff.  He was first recommended to me by a relative who was a periodontist in town.  Truly a dentists dentist. Users/johnchuck

She explained what she was doing and why she was doing it and did everything she could to make me comfortable. It was the best teeth cleaning experience Ive ever had. I definitely recommend Dr. Wilcox and his staff. Users/LisaC

20110701 10:37:02 nbsp NOT a PPO DELTA dentist.
They shouldve made this clear to me when I asked if they take the UC Davis dental insurance.  If youre a student at Davis, youd get more coverage at a different place.  They told me the cleaning work would be covered at 100% THEN after I got all the work done, they told me the truth.  VEEERRRYYY underhanded.  I will not come back. Users/phicoi

20111223 11:55:07 nbsp I have been going to Dr. Wilcox for 33 years and have always been happy with my experience. Dr. Wilcox is always good about explaining the care hes recommending, and his work is excellent. His staff is friendly and competent. I always know Im getting quality care and fair treatment. And by the way, I also have Delta insurance, and have not had a problem with having my dental work coveredIm not sure what the miscommunication could have been for phicoi. Users/RAW

20111223 16:33:18 nbsp In response to phicoi, I do not work for Dr Wilcox but I do work in a dental office. I have known Dr Wilcox and his staff for over 25 years and I do not believe their intentions were ever underhanded. I am so frustrated with Delta Dental that I have started a blog, Key word is started. You can see an example of what most dental offices goes through to ensure that they are giving correct benefit information to their patients while trying to also get your claims paid. http://dentalinsurancenightmares.wordpress.com/ Users/agerould

20120827 10:35:13 nbsp I picked this office because they accept SHIP insurance.  I recommended them to a friend because they were so very friendly, interested in my best interests, etc.  I just emailed them and asked for my dental records and they scanned and emailed them promptly.
