Notes
1. While a diligent effort was made to select products that were reasonably comparable between stores, some differences in product make it impossible to provide an exact comparison.  Users are encouraged to evaluate different products critically and make decisions for themselves.
2. The author acknowledges that pricing is just one of many factors that affect consumer decisions and is not advocating any particular store over another.  In addition to price, users should consider atmosphere, ethics, service, location, or any other qualities they care about when choosing what store to buy groceries at, not just one guys price list on the Internet.
3. A concerted amount of QA/QC was performed as part of this data compilation, but is by no means guaranteed to be 100% accurate.  Users who are sticklers for the complete accuracy should volunteer their own time to get their own perfect price list.
4. Data was collected on April 8 & 9 of 2013.  The prices shown here, particularly sale prices, can change at any time and are should not be considered absolute.
5. The data provided for Nugget Market was collected from their Covell Blvd. location.  It is assumed that the prices between the Covell and Mace locations are similar enough if not the same.
6. The data provided for Safeway was collected from their West Covell Blvd. location.  It is assumed that the prices between the West Covell and Poleline locations are similar if not the same.
7. In many cases, prices were identical for all the different grades of milk fat sold under a single brand in a single store.  A few stores priced their milk fat grades differently, in which case 2% milk fat was always selected.
8. In many cases, prices were identical for all the different types of cheese from a single brand in one store.  A few stores priced different cheese types differently, in which case Mild Cheddar was always selected.
9. Most stores priced salted and unsalted butter identically.  The only store that showed any difference was the Coop, in which case the price for unsalted was selected
10. Grocery Outlet did not carry yogurt in a suitably comparable size (~32 oz).  3x6 oz cups were included in the dataset only as reference.
11. Whole Foods did not carry tritip steak at the time this survey was conducted.  Pricing for Flat Cut Brisket was included instead for reference
12. During data collection, prices for the leanest ground beef available were always selected.
13. Prices for nonorganic foods were always selected first.  If an organic variety was the only option offered at the time of the survey, the price for the organic item was recorded.  Organic products are always noted in the descriptions.  If the product is not described as organic, nonorganic should be assumed.
14. Users should note the units for which stores price produce.  Some stores price by weight, others by individual items.
15. Target, Grocery Outlet and Trader Joes all carry bags of carrots, and do not offer individual carrots.
16. Target, Grocery Outlet, Coop and Trader Joes all carry bundled broccoli, and do not offer individual stalks or crowns.
17. Muiltgrain Peanut Butter Cheerios are admittedly not regular Cheerios, but was the closest thing found at the time of the survey.
18. Frosted Flakes are not wholly equivalent to Corn Flakes but was the closest thing found at the time of the survey.
19. Grocery Outlet only carried 4 lb bags of spaghetti.  1 lb bags were not available.
20. Grocery Outlet only carried 48 oz bags of rice.  32 oz bags were not available.
21. Prices were always selected for 12 packs of soda, unless only 6 packs were available, in which case the 6 pack price was selected.
22. Prices were always selected for 12 packs of beer, unless only 6 packs were available, in which case the 6 pack price was selected.
23. Trader Joes was the only store to price different flavors of ice cream differently for single brands.  Chocolate was selected somewhat subjectively for more or less having a median price.
24. Prices were always selected for 12 roll toilet paper packs, unless only 6 roll packs were available, in which case the 6 pack price was selected.
25. Prices were always selected for 6 roll paper towel packs, unless only 3 roll packs were available, in which case the 3 pack price was selected.
26. The Trader Joes 2 pack Oatmeal & Honey soap is admittedly not a great comparison, but was included for reference.  Of the limited amount of soap options available at Trader Joes, this one was the closest.
27. Both Trader Joes and Whole Foods do not carry acetominephen.  Both carry some alternative medicines, although Trader Joes did not carry an alternative pain reliever.

  Note the price for broccoli at the Coop is only for the conventional, nonorganic variety.  In general, I was only collecting prices for conventional goods, which were typically cheaper.  I only collected prices for organic items if that was the only option available, (it not a perfect comparison, I know, but I tried to note everything as best I could).  I was personally surprised to see bunched broccoli at the Coop though.  Ive definitely bought individual heads of conventional broccoli there in the past.  JT
