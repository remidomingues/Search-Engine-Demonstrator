While there is always a strong debate about city growth in Davis, sometimes reflected in NIMBY attitudes, at times the debate blossoms into political action, with City Council city council, judicial decisions or People voters making decisions that affect the future expansion or careful cultivation of Davis.

Outlying area and neighboring city issues

From 2000 to 2007, an attempt was made to build Dixon Downs, a horse racetrack with plans to expand into a hotel resort and retail plaza.  Located at Pedrick Road and Interstate 80 in Dixon, the nearby nature of the major development was a concern for many Davis residents.  The City of Davis took action and filed a lawsuit against Dixon in Solano County Superior Court (case #http://courtconnect.solanocourts.com/pls/bprod_cc/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_docket_report?case_idFCS028771&begin_date&end_date FCS028771).

##  Whoa, there!  Before you edit this entry, think:  This is about municipal actions regarding growth, not opinions or theories or protests.  Votes and city council or judicial decisions.  This is about the actual municipal code itself and how it has evolved over time.  There are other entries more suited to the actual topic of growth.
