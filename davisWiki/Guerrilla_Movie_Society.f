This group serves as a hub for organizing weekly screenings of atypical films at UC Davis and providing a place to discuss movies. Future movies are suggested by the screenings attendees.

The screenings are free, casual, and require minimal awkward participation. If you at the least want to just watch the weekly film, feel free to join, attend, and tell your friends.

In addition, members can discuss anything related to movies on the board.

The group used to be headed by Ryan Prendeville, but after he graduated in 2007 he passed the torch to Users/SimiSohota Simi Sohota and Oki Oak who now host weekly screenings at either of Simi, Sharmi Basu, or Robert Keatinges houses.
