 Teachers 

At this point the wiki hasnt been presented to the Davis Joint Unified School District school board. If you are a teacher in Davis (or elsewhere else) who has developed a lesson plan that used daviswiki please share it here.

 Lesson Plans 

Lesson Plan Ideas:
  Fourth Grade History tie in for unit on California History.
  Any grade writing assignment.
  As a tie in for projects like http://www.djusd.k12.ca.us/BirchLane/projects/cardosa/VirtualTour/lobby.htm Birch Lane Virtual Tour of Historic Davis.

 Classroom Resource 

Discussion of ways to introduce the wiki as a resource to students at different grade levels.
  Elementary  Are elementary students ever allowed to use the web? Do they do so at home?
  Junior High  Will the wiki be acknowledged at this level?
  High School  We already have some High School students on the wiki as members. It might be a project to have them participating in editing it, perhaps for a media class?
