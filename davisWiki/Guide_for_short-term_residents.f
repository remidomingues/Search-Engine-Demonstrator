Note: Given that Ive only lived here a month, this naturally is not authoritative!  Im hopeful people will run with it.  And, in the process, maybe tell me about stuff I should know about?

While many people come to Davis planning to live here for a long time, some of the population knows from the beginning that their time in Davis will be short.

Some examples are:

  Visiting professors or scholars at UC Davis
  Contract employees at local companies
  Exchange students from other universities
  Graduate students doing research in a campus lab or library

Its not easy to uproot for a short time, but this wiki includes links to a variety of topics that can make getting here, getting settled, and feeling less isolation a lot easier.

 Finding a place to live 

Once youve decided to spend some time here, youll need to find a place in which to do it.  This can be harder if youre not going to be here for the one year that is the duration of a typical lease.

 You can find a place before you arrive 

  If you are a visiting scholar with a letter of invitation, you can stay in one of the three Visiting Scholar Apartments owned by the university for up to three months. Each of the apartments has a queen bed(s), large balcony, washer/dryer, full kitchen, TV, internet access, mail box, etc. They run $400$450 per week. Included with rental is a campus parking pass. To check availability, make a reservation, and view more amenities, go to: http://cevs.ucdavis.edu/Public/content.cfm?CONTENT57
  Craigslist for Sacramento includes ads that can be helpful, either under the http://sacramento.craigslist.org/sub/ sublet&temporary category or the http://sacramento.craigslist.org/roo rooms&shares category.  You can also list your own ad, under http://sacramento.craigslist.org/hsw/ housing wanted.  Just use common sense and watch out for roommate scams.
  You can contact managers of Apartments apartment complexes; if you are arriving midyear, they may have some tenants who have left, and be happy to have you fill in the time remaining on their lease.

  The Housing Guide page may be helpful.
  Services for International Students & Scholars (SISS) has his own bulletin which is weekly updated and for which you can suscribe http://siss.ucdavis.edu/listserv.cfm?idstudent here. It provides listings of items for sale, available housing and related items. If you want to have a message posted on your behalf, you will need to send your message to SISS at siss@ucdavis.edu.

It can be worrying to rent an apartment sight unseen.  Its probably better to have someone (like the person youre visiting in Davis) look at the apartment to verify it exists, before you send thousands of dollars through the mail.

 Or you can arrive, and find a place after you get here 

Youll want a place to stay while youre hunting.

  Hotels would be one option.


 Making sure everythings connected 

If youve found a place in advance of arriving, its good to ensure that it has lights and phone service.  Cable and broadband internet service are also handy.

Bizarrely, some utilities will expect you to know your new ZIP code even though youve never lived here before.  The Davis ZIP codes are 95616 and 95618. The ZIP Codes page provides more information on the parts of town encompassed by each.

  Phone service: AT&T is the local phone provider. You can order service through their http://www.att.com website or you can call them: 18003102355. They generally offer incentives such as free installation through their website, which may or may not be available by phone. They may require a deposit.

   Or, you can just use your cellphone from back home. You could also subscribe to digital voice services through the cable company.

  Power and gas: PG&E is the local power company.  1800PGE5000.  They may require a deposit.

  Cable: Comcast is the local provider. You can order service through their http://www.comcast.com website or by calling 18002662278. They may require a deposit.

  Broadband providers are numerous.  If you want to avoid comparison shopping, both DSL via AT&T or cable modem via Comcast are easy options; neither company has a minimum term requirement.  Depending on where you end up living, its likely that youll have at least one neighbor who already has broadband and is willing to share it via WiFi.  Itd be fair to offer to pay onethird to onehalf that persons monthly internet fees.  Also keep in mind that some apartment complexes offer free or paid internet services to tenants.

 Making sure your mail gets to you. 

  For a shortterm move, its easiest to just have an email provider that lets you read your email here.

  For your postal mail, the https://moversguide.usps.com Postal Service can forward it, and you can sign up online.  Do so a couple weeks in advance.

 Getting to Davis, and getting around in Davis 

  You can take a Yolo County Yolobus to Davis from the nearest passenger airport, SMF, in Sacramento.  Or you can take the http://supershuttle.com/htm/cities/smf.htm SuperShuttle, whose desk is right by the baggage claim area.

  Amtrak serves Davis via its http://www.capitolcorridor.org/ Capitol Corridor commuter route, which usefully connects Davis to the Bay Area. Davis is also served by longdistance Amtrak trains including the Coast Starlight, which runs northsouth (Seattle, WA  Los Angeles, CA) and the California Zephyr, which runs eastwest (Chicago, IL  Emeryville, CA). Connecting trains or buses to just about anywhere can be had from these routes.

  You may need a car when youre here, or it at least may help for the first chunk of time that youre here.  See Car rental.

Once you get here, youll still need to get around.  The Yolo County Visitors Bureau, which is at 604 2nd St., will give you tons of maps. 5302971900

  If youre lucky enough to live downtown, you may never need to do anything but walk once youre comfortably settled.
  Or, you can get a Bike, and join the hordes of cyclists in town.
  There are are also city/university buses run by Unitrans.  One important thing to know is that most buses dont run on Sundays.
  If youre connected to UC Davis, you can take the Davis Berkeley Shuttle to that UC campus.

 Having things to sit on, sleep on, cook with, and eat on 

While it helps to have brought stuff from wherever you actually live, youve surely forgotten something.

It makes a lot of sense to get used stuff when youre only here shortterm.

  http://sacramento.craigslist.org/ Craigslist includes several for sale categories, and also a useful http://sacramento.craigslist.org/wan items wanted category.  Its hard to use craigslist successfully if you dont have a car, but some people will even come to you and bring stuff for you to buy.  So much good karma!
  The Freecycle Network Freecycling is a movement whereby people exchange stuff for free.  This is also probably easier if you have a car.
  Alternatives to Buying lists several options under Furnishing your apartment that may be helpful, especially if youre lucky enough to be arriving near either Moving Day or Freshmen Move Out Day.
  There are a few Thrift Stores in town.
  Theres a used furniture store on L St. (creatively named L Street Furniture), but people on the wiki dont seem too impressed.

You may need some new stuff, too.

  The local ACE Hardware is surprisingly useful: it may be a hardware store, but it also has tons of housewares and cooking implements.
  Davis has one Dollar Stores dollar store; Dollar Tree located in the Davis Manor center on 8th Street. A larger selection of such stores can be found in Woodland.
  If you didnt bring a bed, you may need to buy a mattress or futon at either Davis Mattress and Futon Outlet or Matthews Mattress.  Note that its probably illegal for you to sell your mattress when you leave California. http://www.bhfti.ca.gov/factsheets/rebuilt.pdf (.pdf)

One annoying thing about Davis is that there is no downtown pharmacies drugstore.  The nearest one is a Rite Aid just north of campus.

 Youve gotta eat 

  Grocery Stores
  Restaurants
  Cafes

 Eventually, youll move out 

At the end of your time here, youll need to wrap up your living situation, get rid of the stuff you dont need, get back your security deposit survey security deposit, close all your utility accounts, forward your mail, and go home.  But the original author of this page is still here, so hopefully someone else will jump in and describe this process!

Or, you could always Real Estate move here.
