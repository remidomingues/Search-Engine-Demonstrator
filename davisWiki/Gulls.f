On land, on sea, and in the air, gulls can be found just about everywhere in Davis at different times although the highest diversity and abundance is during the winter months.  In the early mornings a large flock of these Birds and Bird Watching birds can be found doing calisthenics off of Russell Blvd. Russell, between California Ave and Howard Way (see the poorly representative photo below).  At other times youll find them jogging and doing laps with the Ducks ducks in the Arboretum.  After rainstorms, they seem to fill the skies.  Davis has managed to maintain amicable relations with these winged warriors, but  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/01/0107_030107_seagulls.html other places have not faired so well.  Treat them well, however you can see from their beady, squinty little eyes that its fine line between plumed peacenik and bloodthirsty killer.

Gulls come to Davis for one reason  the Landfill. On any given day you can visit the landfill (you need four wheel drive in the wet season) and see hundreds of the birds picking through our waste. Luckily they dont seem to enjoy Project Compost compost very much...

Where else do the gulls hang out in Davis?
