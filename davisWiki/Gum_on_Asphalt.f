Gum on Asphalt is a comic created by Users/HannahMoore Hannah Moore that has appeared in The California Aggie during the 0304 and 0405 academic years.  The comic details the trials and tribulations of Hannah Moore attempting to be a Biology and Art major at UC Davis.  The name Gum on Asphalt is pretty random, but it comes from what Hannahs mother thinks the breasts of flat chested girls look like (They look like gum on asphalt.)
