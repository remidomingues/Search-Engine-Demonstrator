20110609 14:33:16 nbsp Hey, guy, relax.  Take a deep breath.  Read the messages to you on your previous three accounts.  Youre kind of out of control here. Users/TomGarberson

20110609 14:42:49 nbsp It is the same letter.  It keeps getting deleted and I am not sure why.  I am being falsely accused of some individual bouncer at little prague of bothering young women which is a complete out right lie.  Listen whoever this is why dont you read the letter it is the same one over and over again with factual statements.  I have been hearing a lot of talk about my name on the internet and this bouncer owes some explainations
 Users/gumby213  This Gentleman is on this website spreading lies in my name when I will prove to you I have not been to your establishment since April.  I really do not understand the correlation between a 38 year old bouncer on a fraternities website spreading lies in my name.  He asked for a name and my name is Randy and everything that I have said is the truth.
        Where is this accusation?  Please point it out. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845

20110609 14:59:48 nbsp 20110609 13:29:48   WesP (the war hero) Hey Wes you wanted a name? My name is Randy the guy with the spiderweb tattoo. What business do you have coming on friends fraternity website to encourage that people continue to post negative feedback on their page? Telling the administrators on Davis Wiki to encourage other students to bag on this strong organization about some of their members age? I really dont know where you really have a part in it? Now as for me an you. Im not sure what right you have calling me a degenerate. A guy who served successfully in Iraq and now here excelling with a 3.0 in Managerial Economics. So you say you are a vet and now you are 40 some odd years old collecting $2 dollars here and there and you are some how successful? Well Ill tell you what I will be doing in a few days, I will be graduating with my diploma on Saturday. Following that, this degenerate you are speaking of will be flying to Australia and the Bali Islands for the entire summer. Let me get your address I will send you a postcard. Following that I will be returning to my former job, which is Unionized and back to making $45 dollars an hour and continuing to build on that 401K something a war hero like you could never imagine. This degenerate spent a year in Iraq fighting so people like you can clean the toilets at your restaurant when I get back. Before you go spewing false information on the only place you feel you have power (the web) walk your oldhappy ass back to that restroom and take a long look and ask yourself what have I done lately? I mean if you were in my platoon you really wouldnt have lasted a day. I guess thats why you not eating right now because I refuse to pay you that $2 on a Friday night for an empty place. I mean if you need some extra cash you are more than welcome to do some yard work around my house while I am doing real mans work at an age most likely 15 years younger than you. Although I think the most you can handle is reading the birth date on my I.D. when I used to come there last year before the 2$ cover charge. That is another thing, get your damn facts straight, I have yet to be kicked out of a bar yet in Davis in the two years that I have been here. I mean the only information you really gave is that you told someone with a spider web tattoo to leave and that I am not sure when it happened but he was bothering patrons. Before you go spouting out the mouth you should come up with some details, it goes hand in hand with doing your job right. Because If you were truly and efficiently doing your job right you would have checked my I.D. and learned my name already. I mean really you should have learned my name all last year you saw me pretty frequently, but I understand, being a bouncer takes a young mind to respond quickly and logically. You might be better suited doing the dishes. Fact is I was not there a couple weeks ago but it was a couple months ago during lunch when there was no cover charge and me being the only guy in line to give you your two dollar for dinner every Friday night. I suggest you keep your comments to yourself because that fraternity that you are heavily promoting negative feedback on their page will be here long after you and were here long before you became so successful at Little Prague. Yeah and the tattoo, I thought it looked pretty cool after I watched American Me. I mean if you were so interested in tattoos I have one across my chest and all up and down my left arm. And before you go saying that I was bothering girls on a Friday or Saturday night I am usually one of the handful of people in there and I probably brought the girl. I mean jealousy comes from envy, I totally understand. Some people just have that competitive drive while others like you find no motivation in life other to bag on fraternities that have 50 people mind you, that put the food on your table. So I ask you to please ease up on the personal opinions, nobody really cares about a (45 year old bouncer since age is such an issue to you) that could have one day made it, but the chips are all stacked up against him. Talk to your bartender Ryan I have hung out with here a few times lately and she could teach you some manners and maybe how to just get through a day with a happy thought. Until then at ease soldier and dont forget to give me your adress so I can send you a postcard from the islands of Bali. I will make sure it costs 2$. Yeah by the way I am not 30 I am 27, young, successful, lots of money in the account and 401K that is building as we speak. Im glad that Prague does such a great job at choosing its staff.

   When did he tell the administrators on Davis Wiki to encourage other students to bag on this strong organization.  What the hell are you talking about, Randy?  Youre sounding very paranoid.  Youre a full moderator here, Randy  you have equal rights to edit content as ANYBODY else.  You seem to not understand that fact.  Also, when was this encouragement to bag on any organization, and where is the bagging youre complaining about?  Randy  youre the only one ranting here.  And its not clear why youre ranting.  You seem to have made some very bad assumptions here.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845
   Wait... is this a gag?  Are you trying to be funny in a postironic kind of way?  Complaining about things that never happened just to cause drama and confusion?   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845
   Are you complaining about the houseboats comment from 2006?  Thats the only negative comment on Phi Delta Theta.  There were some earlier about a guy with a spider tattoo, but they were discussed and removed awhile back.  If thats what youre trying to bring up, you seem to be the only one bound and determined to do damage to the frats reputation here.  Which is why I suspect you might just be doing this as a joke, or as a sneaky way to make the frat look dumb.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845
