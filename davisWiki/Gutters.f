You are probably looking for information on one of the following:

  Rain Gutters  These are the long troughs hanging under your roofs eaves.  Their intention is to catch roof rain runoff and send it down downspouts (the kind the ItsyBitsy Spider climbs up).  They are substantially less effective when full of leaves, because the leaves act as a sieve and sponge, absorbing the water.  Maintenance of gutters qualifies as  Home Improvement & Repair if you need a professional to clean them or do other work with them.

  Street Gutters  The edge of the street between road and curb.  Their intention is to guide water down the street so it can flow into storm drains.  They are substantially less effective when full of leaves.  In Davis, we have curbside leaf pickup, so when its rainy, please move your leaf pile 69 towards the street so the water can pass by unimpeded.  A rake is an excellent tool for this task.

From the Latin, gutta means a drop and in this linguistic sense refers to the channel form and flowing function.
