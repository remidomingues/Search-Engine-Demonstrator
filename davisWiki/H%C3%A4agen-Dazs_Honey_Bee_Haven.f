The HäagenDazs Honey Bee Haven is a UC Davis garden designed to provide nourishment to honeybees.  It was created as the result of a $125,000 gift to the UC Davis Department of Entomology from the HäagenDazs ice cream company. A major goal of the garden is to raise public awareness about Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a mysterious phenomenon which may pose a serious threat to bee populations.

The gardens grand opening took place on September 11, 2010. Its currently open to the public all yeararound, whenever the sun is up. Its free to get in.

The garden is located just east of the Harry H. Laidlaw Jr. Honey Bee Research Facility, and its area encompasses the site upon which the Baxter House once stood.
