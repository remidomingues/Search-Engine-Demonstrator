20080413 10:13:04 nbsp Great locallyowned store.  Extremely nice people and good service. I purchased a ceramic dispenser and two 3gallon reusable water jugs.  I get my refills there too.  Good way to reduce ones carbon footprint, instead of buying water in nonreusable plastic containers.  Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20081108 16:47:08 nbsp Great store, nice people, they helped me repair my ceramic dispenser and they have the most delicious water in Davis by far. Users/Rennie

20081108 17:51:38 nbsp Ive been going to these guys for eight years.  Great tasting water and well worth the price.  The owners and employees are always happy to chat me up while my 5 containers are being refilled. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090326 13:47:47 nbsp I agree, best water in town and wonderful costumer service.   Users/KCal

20090819 21:20:44 nbsp Does anyone know if they do Reverse Osmosis Deionized water?  I guess I can call in the morning too ;) Users/heyitsdimo

20091114 13:52:30 nbsp I like this guy. His water is all purified then distilled and he knows his business. I am pretty sure he told me he purifies by reverse osmosis before distilling. He will give you the run down on deionized, heyitsdimo. That is what I buy when I did not make it to H20 and we go to Coop. But I think H20s distilled is a better product. Users/LouisM

20091219 00:25:23 nbsp Awesome locally owned store, I bought a sweet water jug here Users/StevenDaubert

20100627 17:53:33 nbsp Love the place, their water is high grade product. Very friendly too. Users/JulioD

20110701 15:44:37 nbsp Just bought jugs and water from them. I love that their plastic is BPA free! The owner was very nice and friendly he even helped me load the water into my car!  Users/DanielleC

20120504 16:02:34 nbsp Extremely nice people, exceptional customer service, and great tasting water! After I discovered a leak in a 3 gallon dispenser I bought the day before, I took it back and they offered me a full refund or exchange for a new container. I decided to just take the refund and get a 5 gallon BPAfree tub ~$14 with a Dolphin manual water pump ~$27 instead, being a little traumatized by the puddle I woke up to this morning. They refilled the 5 gallon bottle for free to make up for the water I lost from the leak, which was only ~1 gallon. Finally, they helped me carry the water back to my car. Will chat you up the whole time. Very nice people and definitely coming here to get my water! Tea tastes very bad with Davis tap water and the calcium buildup ruins my electric kettles. Their water is very good, even after warming up in my car while I shopped at Nugget. Great product, great people, great service. Highly recommended. Will tell my roommates/friends about them (actually I already told 2 of my housemates as I walked into my apartment and showed them the water pump, which they were amazed by lol). Yes that was a long parenthesis but Im too lazy to edit this anymore. Go here & support a local friendly Davis family business! Users/GraceLan
