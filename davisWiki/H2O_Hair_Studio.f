20070603 20:04:12 nbsp I felt obliged to make a comment about this place because Ive been to over 10 barbers and they all told me my hair was hard to style. The lady here knows what she is doing and recognized the type of hair I have. I like that she recommended hairstyles when I asked, so that I can have a professional opinion. Well worth the money. Id recommend this place to anyone. Users/WengFF
