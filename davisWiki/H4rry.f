20090912 18:14:27 nbsp Ah yeah.  I forgot to followup saying that Davis Mail became available to transfers.  That happened a few months ago and I was excited about that.  Just the other day I began to use Thunderbird (an email client) to access Davis Mail (gmail) via IMAP.  Very nice.  Thanks and good luck!  This quarter should be interesting if youve been used to the semester system... Im definitely a little intimidated. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091213 17:15:55 nbsp About the Solo Dining entry on the Explore page... you can always hit the Info button and see who (and often why) a change was made.  In the case of that edit, it looks like Brent removed it with the somewhat cryptic comment Revert to version 334 (rm incomplete page (recent changes gets attention) (dont be shy!)).  When you edit, you only have a single line to make a comment, so sometimes they are a bit less than clear.  In this case, hes saying that hes removing it because the Solo Dining page is not (in his opinion) mature enough to be added to the Explore list.  Entries tend to get added to the Explore entry after they have been edited quite a bit and become full of information.  He then points out that new entries are listed on the Recent Changes tab, which gets them attention so that they are seen by active editors to encourage the growth of the entries by active editors (many of whom watch the list).  Finally, he says Dont be shy!, which is probably him encouraging you to edit and not see the removal as an invalidation of your effort, but just a result of how new and unformed the Solo Dining entry was.  I cant speak for him, but I agreed with the removal at the time... the Solo Dining entry is an utterly fantastic idea in my mind  exactly the kind of community zeitgeist that works well on the wiki.  At the time he removed it (I saw the edit in Recent Changes), I also agreed that it was really just a germ of an idea rather than a fully fleshed out and mature entry.  Even now I think its just on the edge, but at this time Im not removing it.  Always keep in mind that Brent and I are just two editors, just like yourself, and theres always a bit of give and take, back and forth between everybody working on the wiki.  Often if you disagree with a fellow editors changes, you can discuss it and find a workable middle ground, or maybe explain the reason for your edit (or find they have a really compelling reason for their edit you hadnt considered).  In short, never take a contrarian edit as an attack or insult  its just how things work on a wiki as we all edit together.  Its basically the opening of a discussion, since its really easy to toggle back and forth between versions and figure out together what works best.  Or in short (and in Brents own words):  Dont be shy! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101108 09:49:21 nbsp    We do most oral surgery in our office; however, if the extraction is very complicated or if general anesthesia is requested we refer out to a local oral surgeon.  Best thing to do is make an appointment for an evaluation and we can asses the tooth and make a recommendation based upon the situation. Users/DagonJones
