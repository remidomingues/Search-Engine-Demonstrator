I left what you added but restored some of the deleted info. as for the edit on Stonegate Video, i was unsure as to why you deleted the information and so am going to restore it. if you disagree with my edits, feel free to change it. for example, the pages say theyre owned by the same person, is this no longer true? thanks again for editing and for your information!

20070616 11:24:02 nbsp Howdy, Mr. or Mrs. Loyola.  You might want to consider the importance of using your realname here on the wiki  were a friendly bunch.  You might be wondering why your changes to Stonegate Video keep being changed back... Id highly suggest you read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide to the wiki for business owners to get an idea of how best to edit here.  In short, simply removing comments is not generally accepted.  Give a read through and feel free to ask any questions you might have. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20070709 16:41:33 nbsp Hi, to all who have commented on this page. I did not know about this until today. By the way I am not the owner. I am just a friend. I know both current and past owners of both stores. Stonegate Video was sold towards the end of March of 2007 and Videos to Go has new management since May 1st of 2007. Since I actually knew what was going on I felt that I should take the time to correct some of the info. I figured that it would just be an update. Sorry I did not think that people would asume I was the owner and was trying to cover something up about owning both stores. Hehe my bad. Both new owners are nice people. Thanks though for the welcome and I apologize for not responding sooner.   Users/HBLoyola
