Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Health, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan Edwards, pleased to meet you! Its probably not a good idea to edit with a group name: not only does it make you less approachable, youre probably not the only person who can speak for the group  in ten years, will you still be the only person involved in the group?  (For that matter, are you the only person involved in the group right now?) Its up to you, but most people introduce themselves and edit on the wiki with their name and list their affiliations on their user entry (this entry).  At the very least it would be odd seeing a lost dog listing for HEPSexualHealth or see the organization leave a note about a restaurant.  :)  Along the same lines, the reason I removed the new notice about the Google Maps (which is cool, by the way!) is that such notices tend to persist... if you poke around, you can find entries touting new things from organizations that ceased to exist a couple years ago.  Again, its up to you, but thats why I reworded it as a more heres what they have sentence, which will still read correctly a year from now.  Thanks for all the work youve been doing on the entries!
