Regarding the comments, one of the ones youre deleting was posted just 15 days ago:
 20120209 12:28:04 nbsp This place has changed so much for the worse. Not only has there been landscaping work going on for months (including on Thanksgiving day), but it will continue to go on for months to come. The workers are extremely rude to the residents and it has become an inconvenience to even live here. The management does not give out notices to all residents for things like parking lot work which means that your car gets towed (at your own expense) for parking at your own apartment. I used to love this place but I do not recommend signing a lease here because the new owners are more concerned about making money than they are about the people who live here. Users/LMT

When did management change? Users/TomGarberson

20120224 11:29:19 nbsp Its not your page. Sorry. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120224 12:19:23 nbsp Im sorry you feel youve been treated unfairly.  Im not sure how to resolve your concerns without removing community input entirely, though.  Of course comments from users are going to reflect their opinions; thats exactly what they are.  The wiki is used to gather information about everything in Davis, including both raw fact and peoples viewpoints.  Thats part of why its so great.  You can learn about restaurants, apartments, events, streets, activities, and just about anything else in Davis from many different peoples perspectives.  You can also learn about customer service from the way business owners/representatives respond to negative feedback.  That intro page has some examples of people responding extremely well.

Comments from before a change in management are often archived  removed from the page and put onto a separate comment archive page.  The change of management is absolutely good information, and it should be reflected on the page.  Hence my question: when did management change? Users/TomGarberson
