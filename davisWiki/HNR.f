The Historic Nelson Ranch is a horse boarding and breeding facility in Yolo County.  We have trainers offering both English and Western Riding Lessons. I also Help lecture at UC Davis for Jerry Brown in Animal Science.  Our English Trainer Bristol Lee travels to barns in Davis to teach English riding lessons for anyone interested and our Western Trainer, Sabrina Hernandez also works with barns in Davis.

20080709 17:16:36 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. One way to handle mixed Davis Woodland pages is to use interwiki links between the two wikis. For instance if there was a page for Tack Warehouse on Woodland Wiki you could like to it from the Horses page here by typing {{{wiki:woodland:Tack Warehouse}}}. I think it would be best to have the Tack Warehouse page on Woodland wiki, but the Historic Nelson Ranch might make sense to have either here or on both wikis. There are few rules on the wiki, just traditions and customs that weve worked out and continue to work out over time. Users/JasonAller

20090521 21:07:03 nbsp Is the correct name Historic Nelson Ranch & Cattle Co. or Historic Nelson Ranch? You added the former to the Woodland page, but it is a broken link because only the later form exists. You can rename a page if needed and the old name will redirect to the new name.

20090901 06:35:02 nbsp Howdy!  Is there a reason for having Just Ducky Training and a separate entry for Just Ducky Horse Training?  If so, I couldnt see a distinction between the two. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
