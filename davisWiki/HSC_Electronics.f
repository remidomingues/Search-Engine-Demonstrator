The staff of HSC Sacramento have bought the store as of January 25, 2008, and will be reopening it under the name HFE Electronics.  The HSC headquarters in Santa Clara, as well as Rohnert Park HSC, remain open.  However, both remaining locations are more warehouselike than the Sacramento store, and do not have the same friendly atmosphere, though their selections are probably more extensive.

If you like this place, you may also like Surplus Stuff, which is somewhat more computeroriented.
