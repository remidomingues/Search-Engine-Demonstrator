20080625 11:57:39 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. S, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  Thanks for the reviews of Blockbuster and Dimple! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080625 14:22:22 nbsp It took me a good while to figure out how to view this and I hope I am posting a reply correctly, I was never fond of using my real name for everyone to see, but anyways I am Hunter.  Pleased to meet you as well, I simply was very annoyed at blockbuster and dimple for me to leave those complaints.  (Though dimple is by far more deserving of it).... Users/HVS
