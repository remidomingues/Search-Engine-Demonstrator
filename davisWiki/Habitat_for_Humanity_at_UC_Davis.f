Habitat for Humanity at the University of California, Davis (http://www.ucdhabitat.com) is a newly established student organizations college chapter striving to make a positive difference in the local community. It currently boasts a membership of over 150 students and 7 enthusiastic officers under the guidance of Cathy Lawrence (UCD Faculty and Habitat for Humanity Yolo Board member). The Student Organizations club has been established to increase awareness about the need for affordable housing, raise funds for building Habitat homes and work along side future Habitat homeowners.

Additionally, the club hopes to engage deeper into the community by mentoring kids of the families who move into the new houses and offer services at the local homeless shelters and food banks. By doing so, the club members hope to advocate for an end to substandard housing and achieve a better understanding of problems faced within their community.

A dream goal for the club is to raise enough funds to be able to fund its own Habitat house. To reach this goal, we will need the assistance of individuals and organizations on the UC Davis campus and encourage you to donate your time and other resources to the chapter. Please use this site to learn more about us and how you can get involved. You can view the calendar to check or any upcoming events.

The chapter is working in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of Yolo County.
