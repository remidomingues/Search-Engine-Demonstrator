Habitat for Humanity of Yolo County is a nonprofit established in 1993 as an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. Their goal is to eliminate poverty housing worldwide and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience.  They work with Habitat for Humanity at UC Davis.

Since 1996, our local affiliate has built simple, decent, affordable housing in partnership with five very lowincome families in Davis. In 2006, we will begin construction on three more houses in Woodland. Habitat Yolo is continually investigating property for new projects. In time, Habitat homes will be located throughout Yolo County.

Habitat is not a giveaway program. Homeowners invest hundreds of hours of their own labor, sweat equity, into building their Habitat house and they repay our building costs through a nointerest mortgage.
