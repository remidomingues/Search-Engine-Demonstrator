 What is it? 
Hacky Sack is the brand name of a footbag, but no one calls it a footbag so we just say hacky sack.

A little girl came by one time in Davis while we were hacking and said hocky sock so you may hear reference to that as well.

From Wikipedia: The classic hacky sack circle consists of two or more players that keep the footbag off the ground without using their hands. (Read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacky_sack)

There are all sorts of names for different moves, but we keep it simple here.  These are from the founding members circle of friends and may not reflect what you call these moves.  You are welcome to add more.

 Da Basics: 
Foot kick:
 Top foot (Classic Kick)
 Inside foot (Zen)
 Outside foot (European)
 Bottom foot (Soul Kick or Youve Got So Much Soul Kick)

Knee kick

Chest hit

Head hit

Shoulder hit

Elbow hit (Chicken Wing)

Stalls.  You can stall the hack using just about any part of the body.  Just not your hands!
Also note, some people wear hats and a stall on a hat is perfectly legal.
A common stall is one where the person uses their chin to pin the hacky sack to their shoulder or chest.  Another common stall is on the top of the foot.

Hack  This term has multiple meanings.  It can be a short version of hacky sack so someone could say, Lets go hack or something like Ill hack it to you.  It is also used when everyone in the circle gets the hacky sack at least once.  This is usually the goal of a hack circle to get the hacky sack to everyone so you can declare that a hack has been achieved.  How many hacks can your circle get?
