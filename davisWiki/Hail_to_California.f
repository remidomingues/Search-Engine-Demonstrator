Hail to California is the UC Davis Aggie Songs Alma Mater song, composed by Clinton Morse.  The Aggie Band traditionally plays it at the end of UC Davis Home Football Games football and UC Davis Basketball basketball games, and since 2004 has been singing it in fourpart harmony in their Picnic Day street show.  It is also played at UCD Commencement graduation ceremonies by the University Symphony Orchestra UCD Symphony and University Concert Band Concert Band.

{{{Hail to California,
Alma Mater Dear.
Sing the joyful chorus,
Sound it far and near.

Rally round her banner,
We will never fail.
California Alma Mater,
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Hail to California,
queen in whom
were blest 
Spreading light
and goodness
over all the West,

Fighting neath her standard
We shall sure prevail
California Alma Mater,
Hail! Hail! Hail!}}}

History of Hail to California (source: http://www.calband.berkeley.edu/calband/media/calsongs/hailtocal.html Cal Band page) Hail to California was written by Clinton Brick Morse while improvising at the piano in 1907. He was asked by University President Benjamin Ide Wheeler and Professor Gayley to write songs for the rooting section, and Hail to California was one of many he composed (see Sons of California). Morses sentiment was that Sons of California and Hail to California would be nothing unless sung in harmony. The fraternities began to sing Hail to California (though not in harmony), and its popularity subsequently spread. In fact, Hail to California has often threatened to supplant All Hail Blue and Gold as the official Alma Mater of UC Berkeley. Indeed, Hail to California is used as the Alma Mater of UC Davis, UCLA, and of the UC system as a whole.
