Hair Factory Too was a hair salon comprised of independent stylists.  They offered haircuts for $25, but did not take credit card except for on product purchases. They did accept check or cash.

As of January 29, 2007, management had changed and the name became Y2K Nails Y2K Hair and Nails.   Dawn and Sharon still work there.

If you go, ask for Robbie. Hes been in Davis for about 20 years, so he knows the scene. Hes also cut before at Supercuts (a youthful indiscretion). Hes fun and extremely skillful...he should be charging $100.

Robbie is the best.  Love what he does to my hair every 8 weeks.  Couldnt live without him and his kickass humor.

20060316 21:43:59 nbsp Went to see Robbie and he did a fantastic job.  Much better than I got at Hair Saloon. Users/MonicaWilliams

Hair Factory too was awesome, ask for Dawn.  She totally fixed my hair when it was fryed!!  Prices are awesome, and her color work is spectacular, she told me she goes to monthly hair coloring/hair classes to stay updated.

20060407 13:37:41 nbsp If youre a guy, ask for Natasha.  There is no one more awesome than her.  Its not even something that can be explained, you just have to experience it. Users/DominicCardenas

20060805 13:21:33 nbsp Highly Recommended.  Ask for Dawn!  She takes the time to listen to what you have to say and offers plenty of suggestions and ideas.  $25  shampoo + haircut.  Totally worth it! Users/DipanPatel

20060805 13:31:50 nbsp thats one expensive hair cut for a guy, I assume the $25 is for womans haircut, do guys get cheaper rates? Users/JoeRunnels

20060808 18:22:54 nbsp Its $25 for mens hair as well.  But go see Dawn, shes absolutely amazing.  She definitely will work with you to get the most out of your hair. Users/MattKemmerle

20060902 15:09:08 nbsp Hair Factory Too was such a great experience but it was all thanks to Dawn. She is the nicest person ever! Shes an expert at coloring/cutting hair. I have dark hair but wanted some subtle highlights. She knew exactly what to do. I was nervous but she did such a great job! I love my new hair!! Ask for Dawn if you go because shes a pro and shes the sweetest person. Prices are great too!  Users/JenniferGarcia

20060919 16:02:08 nbsp Young Sook is the best esthetician in town!  She is gentle, thorough, and reasonably priced! Users/LucyVeiga

20060919 20:47:23 nbsp I just got back from getting my hair done by Natasha  she did a great job.  She gave me something different and a great cut/style, Im definitely going back! Users/RohiniJasavala

20060926 16:48:01 nbsp Dawn did a good job on my hair, and was pleasant to talk with. The space is really old and everything seems cheap there, so dont expect a professional looking salon. Users/DjangoAndrews

20061019 21:21:30 nbsp Natasha is at  HairFactory is an extremely skillful hair stylist. I have been to Supercuts, True Beauty and Tangles in Davis only to be disappointed, but when I was referred to Natasha, I was finally happy. I will recommend her to any girl who cares about her hairstyle. Natasha is an expert at using the right tools for the look you want and your input is always welcome with her. Every time I go, the cut is precise, no uneven or poofy spots and the style is just perfect.  Users/AleksandraSoroker

20061229 12:27:12 nbsp After reading the great reviews about Dawn, I decided to try her out.  She really did a great job, so I promised her that Id add a comment!  Im trying to grow my hair out after having a very short cut, and I had no idea what to do with it during this awkward stage.  She was confident, knew exactly what to do and explained her suggestions to me, and gave me a great cut.  She was very meticulous and noticed things about my hair that most other hairdressers ignore.  I left very happy! Users/SarahLockhart

20070113 14:30:50 nbsp After getting a bad haircut elsewhere, I decided to try out Hair Factory.  Dawn was awesome.  She knew exactly what to do to get my haircut back on track (its going to take a while to grow out the old mistakes), gave great suggestions, and made the whole experience a pleasure.  To top it all off, the price was only 35$.   For the quality of work she does, thats a steal.  Ill definitely be going back.   Users/ErinHendel

20070130 15:32:54 nbsp Got my hair cut this morning from Sharon. I work down the street and came in without an appointment; she took me in and gave me a haircut in half the time she usually allots, and did a great job, exactly what I asked for. Was only $30. Only complaints are that she insisted on washing my hair even though I had just washed it an hour before (said it had to be wet to cut or it would hurt her scissors) and she was very picky about the way I sat. When I crossed my legs or fidgeted with my nail polish, she asked me to stop. Good haircut but I dont like being told what to do, so dont know if I will go back...  Users/ElleWeber

20070207 22:49:16 nbsp Everyone there is really nice, but I go to Sharon and shes great! I had a really bad experience at a hair stylist back home, and shes a breath of fresh air. I trust her completely and shes so nice. I recommended her to all my friends, and now all my roommates go and see her as well (they love her too).  Users/LauraSharp

20070406 08:10:14 nbsp Robby is the greatest!! Great haircuts and a fantastic sense of humor. Users/MimiC

20070410 16:18:16 nbsp Robby is fantastic! I have had many bad hair stylist experiences.. and I am glad that I have finally found a quality salon. Users/mynameisbernice1

20070512 13:54:52 nbsp After reading all the reviews about the different hair salons, I saw how many consistent great reviews there were about Dawn so I decided to give her a shot. I got my haircut today and she truly lived up to her great reputation!! From the beginning to end, she told me what she was doing to my hair and why. She didnt chat with me too much while she was cutting my hair and I felt that she was focused on cutting my hair and making it look great.  After she cut it, she blow dried it and gave me several quick lessons on the different ways I could style my hair. She was awesome!!!! I recommend her to anyone! She is by far the best hair stylist Ive ever went to!!  For girls who are hesitant in getting their haircut in Davis and cant go home to your regular stylist (as in my situation), you can definitely trust Dawn with your hair ) Haircut$25, Haircut and blow dry$35 Very affordable!  Users/StephanieHunt

20070604 13:59:28 nbsp I was surpised that at the beginning it does not let you know that Robbie is also still working at the Hairfactory Too!! I just got my hair done the other day and I love it!! o Users/Meernisse

20070703 15:23:43 nbsp Robbie is Amazing!!! He is more than a hairstylist he is an artist. I have tried many stylists in town and Robbie is the first that gives me a great cut every time. I decided to do something radical to my hair. I cut off 10 inches and colored it for the first time. Robbie was very considerate of nervousness and did a beautiful job. The style and color he chose goes perfectly with my frame and skin tone. You can tell that he takes pride in his work. Users/Hilda

20070724 12:07:54 nbsp They are now Y2K Nails. Robbie is still there doing hair. They are using the same phone number. Users/Hen

20070821 10:31:03 nbsp Ah! I walked into Y2K hair and nails and went straight up to Dawn.  I died my beautiful blond locks black. It wasn’t even a pretty black. It was like green black and I had a date in 5 hours! Not only did she fix my hair to a light brown color that day, she scheduled appointments to get my hair lighter and blonder.  Since then, we have experiments, but the way she treats my hair, it is as good as new, hardly any damage and still incredibly healthy.  I don’t know of any other hair stylist that could not only fix gross green black hair, but become a friend and a confidant! Users/Alysa

20071120 20:00:12 nbsp I go to Dawn at Y2K downtown for my hair, and I love her!!!  She really cares about her clients and shes really honest, which is one of the best traits a hair stylist can have.  She pays attention to detail and does a fantastic job.  Im really picky about my own hair, but with Dawn I really trust her in having the executive call on what cut will look good on me, and she has yet to disappoint me.  On top of everything, shes a total sweetheart!  I highly recommend her! Users/KimL

20071129 20:51:23 nbsp I went to to this place (now Y2K Hair and Nails Spa) because of all the great comments; unfortunately my experience wasnt great.  Although it wasnt a disaster, I was unsatisfied with the haircut that I got...especially for the price.       Users/YupYup

20080115 22:53:49 nbsp Dawn (at Y2K downtown) did a great job of cutting and coloring my hair!  She really worked with me to help select a hair color (I have black hair and wanted it lighter, but hate the damage that results from bleaching).  She won’t do something that will damage your hair, and my hair felt stronger and healthier after I left the salon.  I really appreciated her advice and input.  She’s also extremely sweet and funny, so I had a great time )  I recommend Dawn, especially if you want someone that’s honest and cares about the health of your hair.   Users/sandrahnesna

20080819 14:51:51 nbsp Worst ever. So I walk in, and immediately tell the woman there sharon? that I wanted my hair cut first and then dyed. Told her I had a 2.5 hour time frame, and if there wasnt enough time I just wanted a haircut. She said, oh, there is definately enough time! When I went in I had platinum blonde hair, and wanted to go brown to match my roots. Knowing that it could be splotchy with such a color change I didnt do it myself and went here.

So first she dyes it, a very dark brown color that I had chosen, and then a man walks in. She sits me down to wait to let the color set and she begins cutting his hair and taking her time talking with him, and once shes done with him, she washes and blow dries his hair while still slowing her pace. Eventually an hour or more later he starts to leave. So she washes out my brown coloring with 2 shampoos, and hands me a towel. I notice I have to leave. So she hands me another towel to dry my hair, and tells me shell cut it at another time. And that she doesnt have enough time to dry my hair. I am frustrated by now that Im going to be late for where I need to go, that she didnt cut my hair when I specifically told her thats what I wanted first, and that I cant see the result of this dye job.

She tells me itll be 70 dollars and in a hurry I pay her with a tip.

My hair finally dries by the end of the class I had to rush to, and when I look in the mirror I notice its splotchy and has stripes like a tiger.
Not to mention incredibly dry and unhealthy feeling. My hair had been bleached blonde by angies salon twice this year already, and was still incredibly soft and healthy like it is naturally, after this one visit my hair is incredibly dry and strained. When I went to get my haircut at angies never going back to hair factory too again, they tried to fix the dryness, and gave me an excellent CHEAP haircut.

Moral of the story? Dont pay 75 dollars for a shitty dye job and bad service. Go to angies and get it done excellently for a good price. Or do it yourself for 1/3 of the price and get the same results. Users/someday909

20080905 19:38:08 nbsp If you have long hair, go to Sharon.  Im pretty judgy when it comes to haircuts, and most hairdressers shy away from investing time in styling long, thick hair.  Shes the only one in town who not only didnt ruin my hair, but actually knew exactly what I wanted when I described it, and made it beautiful! It grew out healthy too!  Shes the most skilled hairdresser Ive been to in this county.
 Users/HillaryThomas

20081029 17:05:01 nbsp Earlier this year, I brought in a picture to have my haircut done with Dawn after reading some positive reviews about her. Unfortunately to my big disappointment, not only did she not make my hair look anything like in the picture, she cut my hair into a style that she thinks a typical Asian woman would have. It was a total disaster. My husband cringed afterward in total distaste. I will not go back again considering I spent a total of $35 and got no result. Users/supernova365
