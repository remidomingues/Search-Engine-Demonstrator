20120111 15:19:51 nbsp Michelle is great! She cut my hair a few weeks ago and I am still loooving it. I usually hate getting my hair cut because Im very picky and have a hard time describing what I want (and therefore dont ever get the exact cut I was hoping for). But she did such a great job, Im probably going to be going back to her for a long time saying, Just do what you did last time!
