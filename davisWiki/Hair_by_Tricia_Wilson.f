20090131 06:07:12 nbsp Tricia did my hair for YEARS before I moved out of state.  Let me tell you, I have not found another like her in almost four years!  I wish I could fly back to Davis every six weeks and have my hair done.  She is great at doing exactly what you want and great at giving you ideas if you are stuck but want to try something new.  I highly, highly recommend her. Users/JillBarrett

20110527 19:06:50 nbsp Im really picky about the way people cut my hair, especially my bangs. I, however, let Tricia take the reins on this one. She knows how to cut my hair, so that Im happy with the outcome every time. Shes also really knowledgeable about all things hair related. I was so impressed with her work that I hired her to do my hair for my wedding! Users/SarahdeGuzman

20131108 14:50:33 nbsp Tricia has been doing my hair since I was 13. At the time I was swimming 4 hours a day and had green hair, somehow she managed to bring my hair back to life, and I have been seeing her ever since then. I am now 29 and every time I go in there I know I am going to come out feeling great. I would highly recommend Tricia to do your hair, no matter what you are feeling like she can do it, and do it great!!! Users/AdinaTaylor

20131206 23:45:59 nbsp Tricia is awesome.  She has been cutting and coloring my hair for over 8 years.  She always listens and cuts my hair in the style/length I request.  She has given me fun highlights on occasion.  I always get compliments on my color/cut after I see Tricia.  Plus, she is just a lot of fun.  I always enjoy visiting with her.  The Avant Garde Studio is laid back and relaxing.  The space is very open with high ceilings and lots of natural light.  Everyone who works there is welcoming and friendly.  Youll notice from this page that Tricia has many loyal longterm clients.  Try her once and youll probably become one too!  Highly recommended! Users/DinaBiscotti

20131218 16:19:19 nbsp Tricia has highlighted my hair for a few years now. She is a fantastic conversationaist if you like chatting and she does a beautiful job on my hair. Ive gotten complimented on my highlights many times, most notably once in Japan by a woman who rolled her eyes and said Of course your stylist is all the way in Californiaâ€¦ There have been a few times where Ive called Tricia in need of a trim or color immediately and shes been great about getting me in as soon as possible!! I highly recommend Tricia if youre in need of a new stylist!  Users/CarolinePeters
