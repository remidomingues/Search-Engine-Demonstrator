20090109 11:26:22 nbsp Do you cover SD camera cards?  My cameras went out a while ago, and it forced a format.  I know most of the pictures are still hidden in there... Users/EdWins

Yes, I can recover SD camera cards.  A format is not the end of the world as long as you didnt shot more pictures over it.  Haiyong Li

20090109 22:53:59 nbsp What filesystems have you worked with? Users/NickSchmalenberger

I work with Mac (HFS+) PC(fat32, ntfs, or even if you still have a fat16 drive somewhere :)), linux.  Actually, for hard drive recovery, often times, file system is secondary especially when the bios is having problem recognize the hard drive at all.  Haiyong Li

20090405 14:01:40 nbsp Haiyong recovered the data from my failing external harddrive over the weekend, great service. Can definitely recommend.

20090713 12:14:16 nbsp He has just fixed my HD and recovered ALL my data. Knowledgeable, reliable, flexible, honest. Really a good service. Recommended! Users/marco.pritoni

20091023 22:59:59 nbsp Do you do the work yourself or is it sent out to a recovery company.  Honest question. Users/Khanh

I do the work myself.  Other companies charge a lot more than I do.  :)  Haiyong Li

20100207 22:45:34 nbsp Haiyong offers a great and affordable local service. My story is rather long, but the important things you need to know are the following: (1) Unless you have thousands of extra dollars to spend on a larger data recovery company, this is the way to go. (2) The communication is great, and Haiyong knows what he is doing. (3) If you live in the Davis area, I would recommend trying this first if you need data recover. If it safe, fair, and simple.

I lost nearly 1TB of data from a large external hard drive that failed on me. Most people who need data recovery arent dealing with problems of this size, but I can tell you that considering the extent to which I was feeling helpless, getting everything recovered and back in order was relatively quick and inexpensive. Data recovery is very stressful, especially when it involves data that is of sentimental and personal value. He minimized this as much as possible. Overall, Haiyong offers great customer service, I recommend his services to anyone in need of data recovery. Users/timsilva

Thanks Tim, glad that I can help. Haiyong Li

20100208 00:54:16 nbsp I have a hdd that had XP on it, I want one folder that had pictures... it was doing the click of death. Drivesavers said it was no bueno could you take a crack at it? Users/StevenDaubert

I am not sure how to contact you.  Could you please call me at 530.633.7753 or send email to davisdatarecovery@comcast.net?
Thanks. Haiyong Li

20100603 22:57:55 nbsp Great service! I had a pretty urgent case, needed data recovered from a crashed hard drive about a week before finals. He was able to quickly and completely recover my data, and even charged me less than standard since my case was so straightforward. Very knowledgeable and helpful. Thanks! Users/JYu

20100707 18:04:06 nbsp When you recover the data, does that mean that you can actually fix hard drives that are making the click noise, or do you usually just make them work long enough to recover certain sets of data? Users/ScottMeehleib

I dont try to fix hard drives.  I would try different means to access the data on the drive for recovery.  IMHO, it is the data that is most critical to people.  The hard drive nowadays are at such a reasonable price.  Those generally temporarily fix will actually cost more to the user at a long run.   Haiyong Li

20100710 19:20:03 nbsp Highly recommended! I had a problem with one of my external hard drives. After attempting to diagnose the problem myself, I called Haiyong Li at 5pm. He listened as I explained the issue with my hard drive, and then proceeded to tell me that he was confident that he could help. An hour later, I dropped off the hard disk with Mr. Li. He gave me a detailed receipt of the service he was going to provide and continued to put my mind at ease about the hard drive. He emailed me the next day with a very positive and informative update and I brought Mr. Li another hard disk for file migration. Mr. Li accepted payment only after all services were rendered.

Mr. Li was 100% professional and efficient. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that Haiyong Li minimizes the stress of having a hard drive problem. Mr. Li is as knowledgeable as he is humbly optimistic, and I could not recommend his services enough. If he didnt actually save my Ph.D., he surely helped me maintain my sanity during its final phase.

Again, I highly recommend Haiyong Lis Data Recovery Service!  Users/Patrick

Thanks Patrick.  Really appreciate your kind words. I am glad that I was able to help. Haiyong Li

20100805 21:15:30 nbsp Haiyong Li did a fantastic job recovering data from my external hard drive after it became corrupted. The data was priceless  family photos, work files, etc. I took it to another good repair business, but they didnt have the tools to tackle this problem. The next step was a place in Sacramento or MaxtorSeagate  both would charge exorbitant amounts that I couldnt afford. Haiyong kept me in the loop as he tried different approaches, letting me know the risks and results at each step. He masterfully found ways to magically salvage the lost data. Were extremely grateful for his work and highly recommend him for data recovery at very reasonable rates you wont find elsewhere by such a competent person.  Ron Unger Users/rung

20101018 23:10:41 nbsp Wow, you even have a Jaz drive! I just told my old boss to send you some business. :) Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101022 09:06:32 nbsp Haiyong Lis Data Recovery service is excellent.  He was able to recover all of my data from a cheap thumb drive that just stopped working.  The recovered files were in original condition with no corruption or data long. He complete the diagnosis and recovery in less than 24 hours. I highly recommend him for any data loss problems.

20101116 12:29:53 nbsp Haiyong did a fantastic job recovering about 1500 missing images from my compact flash cards. I never did figure out what went wrong with the cards, but he got me the data back in about 3 hours, for a nominal price. I highly recommend Haiyong Lis Data Recovery Service. Users/EliasMarvinney

20110224 03:00:42 nbsp I have referred clients to Haiyong over the last year or two, and every client is very pleased with his work.  He is extremely skilled at data recovery, and it is wonderful to have such a great resource here in Davis.  Jamie, Computer Doctor Users/JamesMorton

20110604 15:40:24 nbsp My wife was crushed when her ancient 80gb external drive crashed.  I hit up daviswiki.org to see what our options were for a recovery.  The feedback here persuaded us to contact him.  We were delighted with his service and our restored files.  While I hope to never need his services again I can and do recommend him without reservation.  Thanks for your help Haiyong. Users/GregYen

20110608 22:57:49 nbsp Very capable. After my laptop crashed, our IT service department at UC Davis was unable to recover the files from the HDD and SSD. Li Haiyong was able to recover the data from the HDD and ordered an extra ZIF connector to get the data from the solid state drive too. The service is very reasonably priced. He is friendly, quick, and reliable. I highly recommend his service.  Users/bcschipper

20110823 07:25:19 nbsp I cant say enough about what excellent service Haiyong has provided us with.  One of our hard drives failed taking along with it a huge swath of pictures of our son as a toddler.  Haiyong was reassuring, honest, thorough, flexible, patient and a pleasure to work with and he definitely went the extra mile as we had a particularly challenging case.  I would highly recommend him to anyone needing data recovery service.   Debbie Users/davisdebbie

20111202 15:58:13 nbsp I was extremely impressed with Haiyongs professionalism, punctuality, skill, honesty and overall service.  We all know how expensive data recovery can be (as it is so time consuming).  He at first quoted me a level 2 retrieval and later emailed to say the good news is that I have discovered I can do a level 1.  It was half the price.  He met me at my convenience as to where and when to pick up my computer and drop off the data.  He was responsive and easy to reach by phone and email.  He went the extra mile and immediately recovered a final paper that was due that day and emailed it to me.  He sent me another file I needed the next day.  Really exceptional! Users/SusanJaneArevalo

20120111 12:42:18 nbsp Haiyong provides an excellent service. He recovered a large amount of data from a harddrive that I thought was totally wrecked.  Users/DavidDallas

20120307 19:58:01 nbsp Haiyong recovered all data on my corrupt HD around a month ago, and even formatted an external wireless drive to put the files on. He does a great job and is very helpful. Excellent Job! Users/MG

20120422 18:41:38 nbsp My external hard drive recently crashed, so I found Haiyongs service via Davis Wiki. I wasnt entirely familiar with the process of data recovery, but Haiyong did an excellent job of explaining what needed to be done and at what price. His service is quick and professional and I would highly recommend it to anybody who doesnt want to tear open their drive first. Users/DanielNgo

20120711 11:39:54 nbsp A while back I ended up accidentally formatting one of my external hard drives. I found Haiyongs services through DavisWiki, and after contacting him and having him pick up my hard drive, he was able to recover all of the data I needed back, with file names intact. Excellent service, definitely recommend! Users/RichardTruong

20120814 18:40:28 nbsp Just adding another success story. He salvaged all the data in my external hard drive within 4 days at a reasonable price. Exceptionally happy with his great service.  Users/ShinAePark

Hiayong Li was amazing. He was able to recover my HDD when Driversavers said it was unrecoverable. He also did it at fraction of the cost that they wanted and was very helpful from start to finish. I would highly recommend him for any and all data recovery needs! Daubert

20130525 07:51:53 nbsp Haiyongs service is good and exactly as advertised. Users/JonBrockway

20130628 18:19:44 nbsp After using 2 other data recovery services in the Davis area and being told the data could not be recovered or the hard drive needed to be Mailed in to specialists, I returned the drive to Haiyong.  Haiyong thoroughly analyzed the drive for a second time and found it was in worse shape than it previously had been.  He kept me apprised of all progress made via email which I found very reassuring.  I especially needed some important Outlook PST files which Haiyong was unable to locate initially.  After letting him know about those, he put in the extra effort and was able to find the files.  I am completely satisfied with both the service and the reasonable pricing and would recommend Haiyongs service to anyone! Users/JonBrockway

20140421 02:14:32 nbsp Haiyong is a very nice guy with an excellent attitude. He has great customer service skills and is very patient and understanding. He repaired my damaged external hard drive and recovered several hundred GB of priceless family memories that I feared I had lost forever. He thoroughly explained the necessary steps and informed me honestly about the costs, risks, and probability of data recovery. In order to perform the repairs, Haiyong asked me to replace the PCB circuit board. However, he compensated me for the cost of the spare parts and the shipping! Most impressively, he did not collect payment until he successfully carried out the repairs! I would highly recommend Haiyong to anyone who needs to recover data! He is great at what he does and just a good dude overall!  Users/PaymanAlemi
