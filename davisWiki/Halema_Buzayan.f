Halema Buzayan, a Davis Senior High School Honor Student and President of her schools Muslim Student Association (MSA), is a central figure in a June 2005 http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?sectioni_team&id4000500 incident that was finally covered by the media in March 2006.

It has been alleged that the Davis Police Department and Yolo County District Attorney pursued the case far beyond normal due to the fact that Buzayan is a Muslim. She was arrested for an automobile accident that she was allegedly involved in, after her family had agreed to pay damages to the other driver. Dean Johnson, a former San Mateo County prosecutor and legal analyst for ABC 7, alleged that the Davis Police overstepped their bounds in the following three ways:

  The police violated Halemas constitutional rights by entering the home without saying they were there for an arrest.
  They treated the girl as if she were an adult accused of a felony.
  The police violated their own policy against filing criminal charges in a minor hit and run, if its been settled civilly.

Another possible point not brought up by Johnson is that the media did not cover the most serious charges, which contain not only an unlawful arrest but violation of her Miranda Rights and denial of the right to an attorney.

The case was dismissed by the Yolo County Superior Court on April 17, 2006. In June 2006, the family filed a claim of unlawful arrest and several other allegations against the city and district attorney. The full text of the claim can be found at: http://iteamblog.abc7news.com/2006/06/davis_hit_run_d.html ABC News.

On November 3, 2006, the Buzayan family, filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Davis, the Davis Police Department, the Yolo County District Attorney’s Office, The Davis Enterprise and individual members of each organization. In its lawsuit, the family is claiming intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress stemming from Halema’s arrest, prosecution and the subsequent attention from the Davis City Council and reporting in The Davis Enterprise http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/12/10/news/021new1.txt click for story.

In June 2006, the lawsuit against the Davis Enterprise was dismissed under Californias antiSLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute.  Since the Enterprise had acquired the tapes of the police interviews of the juvenile legally the Court determined that it was not liable for posting the recordings on the newspaper website. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2007/06/27/news/190new2.txt click for story

20060323 10:06:32 nbsp It is sad that a sixteen year old girl has to have a wiki page made about her over this topic. This case is going to get real messy (and maybe expensive). I brought it up at the city council candidates forum this last Monday and there were a lot of people in the audience that had no idea what I was talking about because the local press has ignored it. Im sure The California Aggie the Aggie will do something with it, come the beginning of the spring quarter, because they are a lot less biased than the The Davis Enterprise Enterprise. Users/RobRoy
  I dont know about less biased but certainly differently biased! I try to read both papers so I can get more sides of a story. :) Users/CindySperry

20060328 12:05:06 nbsp First of all, some of the sense of racism charges have to do with the nature of some of the comments that Officer Ly makes to himself.  Secondly, the news media has made much of the story about the arrest which is a bit baffling because I have seen both cars and not only does the height of the vehicles not line up, but the damage doesnt match.  Now normally the law is that once damages (civil) are accepted by the victim, legal action is not allowed.  That did not happen here.  Third, the victim herself in this case is outraged.  Finally, the media has not covered the most serious charges which contain not only an unlawful arrest but violation of Miranda and denial of the right to an attorney. Users/DavidGreenwald

20060403 22:36:58 nbsp Today, after 10 months since the incident took place, 7 court sessions, God knows how many hours of work from city personnel, yolo county personnel, and understaffed Davis police department officers, and after thousands of dollars (I hope not millions) of tax payers money this issue has not been resolved yet. As a matter of fact Halemas trial hasnt even been started yet. So far, all that has been done in court is submition and discussion of motions, which brings up the following questions:

 1. How much longer time will it take and how much more of tax payers money will be spent before this case is over?.
 2. What are the residents of Yolo county and those of the city of Davis gaining from spending all this money and efforts when we know that even if the judge rules that Halema is guilty she will not be paying the so called victim a single penny more on top of what her parents had already paid before the charges were even filed?.
 3. Why are thousands of tax payers money are being spent on a case that Mr. Buzayan resovled 10 months ago with only 870 Dollars?.

If this is the way all hitandrun cases are handeled, both the Yolo county and the city of Davis will go bankrupt just after a hand full of similar cases. What money do they save to investigate, prosecute, and try bank roberries, burglaries, homicides, drivebyshootings, and other criminal activities that are more serious than a minor misdemeanor such as a hitandrun. How about using tax payers money for other important issues such as schools, healthcare, water resources, environment, flood protection, affordable housing, etc. In conclusion, I strongly believe that since the damages were paid for to the satisfaction of the so called victim, the charges should be dropped immdediately so that no more tax payers money will be wasted on this case and a better chance will be given for spending on just causes.  Users/AnisSury

20060407 18:57:28 nbsp I think the police certainly acted inappropriately here, but I dont see any reason to conclude that it has anything to do with the family being Arab. To assume so anyway, and for the Arab Council to become involved, will only exacerbate side issues that shouldnt exist in the first place. I think that the real explanation for this is that some people in Davis want to have an incident of police brutality so they can feel outraged, and they think this is it. I think the real solution is to have a smaller police department that doesnt have time for stuff like this instead of a police review board. This way the same problem is solved with less people and a smaller government.

Users/AbdolhosseinEdalatiSarayani says below, Davis cops have a history of making work for themselves where none exists, and the solution to this is reduce the police department so they are busier with real work. There wasnt just one mistake here, this was the police repeatedly pursuing this case after it had been resolved civilly and there was not any life or property at risk. Is that what a police force that is too busy would do? Ultimately, treating people badly wastes more time for the police than it will benefit them and they will realize this sooner with a smaller department.

I dont think the city council, city manager, and city lawyer care one way or the other except for however can make the least trouble for them. So I think that if they treat the Buzayan family badly, it is because they are trying to cover for the police department just because they think that will be easier than fixing it. That may or may not be true, but I suspect it comes down to just what they, maybe arrogantly as you say, think is easiest and most convenient. As for the police, you are right that the family may have been personally targeted, but that could be for lots of reasons (and I am not saying there are good reasons). Maybe Officer Ly has a grudge with the family. I dont know, but I really dont want to assume that it is racism or a similarly broadbased discrimination. I think it would be a very bad idea to jump to conclusions about that and if it ever becomes explicit it will look that much more ridiculous. Users/NickSchmalenberger

  The main reasons to think so, as far as I can see, are a) that there dont seem to be any other reasons why the police would pursue this case, let alone pursue it so aggressively, and b) the arresting officer (Ly) s comments about Halema Buzayan and her mothers head scarves. Users/KenjiYamada

  Racism could definitely be a factor, and it doesnt matter what the police new before the investigation: take for example racial profiling data. A survery of the CHP found that their was no real disparity in how the CHP pulled over different ethinicities, the disparity occurred in the punishment that was given out. Blacks and latinos were more likely to receive tickets and have their property towed. The investigation was not inappropriate it was everything that happened after the act. Users/JamesSchwab

  So because an incident of police misconduct occurs, it only occured in a vacuum with no externalities and because people wanted it to happen? That makes sense. Users/JamesSchwab
  What is that better solution? Users/KenjiYamada
   Less police. Users/NickSchmalenberger
    An inflated size of police department could be a budget issue, if city officials determine so, but I dont think it would lead to repetitive misconduct. I believe that Regardless of the size of the police deparment, absolute authority and lack of accountability is what makes police officers cross their boundries. On your doubts of it being a case of discrimination, May be it is not a case of discirimatnion against muslims in particular. May be it is one of the cases of discrimination against any one outside the norm, as Mr.Users/AbdolhosseinEdalati put it below, which does not make it any less worthy of public attention and call for correction. As far as the NCA involvement, The The National Council of Arab Americans NCA is an Arab American organization and not a Muslim American organization. That means the NCA is interested in issues concerning all Arab Americans including muslims, christians, Atheists, and all other colors of the spectrum. I dont understand how would their involvement exacerbat side issues that should not exit in the first place. If you would please give examples of such side issues that could be exacerbated by NCAs involvement. and also please give examples of past cases where NCAs involvement exacerbated side issues that should not exist. Personally, I dont know about NCA except from what I read on their website and from what I heard in todays meeting. Users/AnisSury
    This is an absurd argument.  If anything, less police will make the police more likely not less likely to make mistakes.  They are spread too thin as it is.  They are unable to adequately respond right now.  We really need to hire more police for the load that they have to bear.  Decreasing the number would mean more stress, more anxiety, less rest, which will increase frustration and the number of mistakes that are made.  I really wish people would think their solutions through. Users/DavidGreenwald
  The NCA just got involved yesterday where the issue has been going for 10 months. Jamal gave the police department and the city of Davis many chances to correct their mistakes through contacting the chief of police, the city council, and the city manager through their own self correcting procedures. They were so arrogant and ignored his complaints. also the city lawyer theatened him in one of the meetings, as jamal explained during yesterdays meeting. That means, the arresting officer, the chief of police, the city manager, and city council are all involved (according to your argument all of these guys have nothing more important to do except to creat work for themselves by harressing tax paying residents of the city of Davis. I am not arguing on this issue). To go back to the discrimination issue, and given the above, it is the police departments reponsibility now to explain to every one why are they treating the Buzayans this way. The police department used a totally different procedure with the Buzayans than what their standard procedure lays out, therefore, they must come up with good reasons for why they did that in order for me not to believe that Jamal and his family are personally targeted. If the police department fails to come up with good reasons then, in an indirect way, the police department admits that Jamal and his family are personally targeted, and therefore it is a discrimination of some kind. I leave it up to them to pick up what basis of discrimination it is. Never the less, if there is doubts of discrimination on any basis, as there is many in this case, all civil society organizations that work to promote and protect civil rights can and should act including CAIR, NCA, NAACP,ACLU, and all the others to make sure that no discirimination is involved or to call for corrections if discrimination is proven to have taken place.Users/AnisSury
  Nick, you have a good point there. However, the failure of coming up with good reasons from the part of the police department and the city officials over the last 10 months only strengthened doubts, made possibility of discrimination more believable to be valid, and made situtation worse. After reading your discussion above and thinking more about what has been going on, I could not recall that the Buzayans have ever claimed that they were discriminated against. Even in their civil litigations, they claimed violation of constitutional rights but they did not make any reference to any kind of discrimination. I do recall though, that they have been very consistant in demanding explanations from the city officials for what they have been subject to. Having said that, I still think that it is very appropriate for the NCA and CAIR to get involved at least to investigate possibilities, clear doubts, and lead their public bases to take the right stand. Until today, as far as I remember, neighter the NCA nor CAIR have made any statement with any references to discrimination claims.Users/AnisSury

20060407 22:46:45 nbsp I do not think that this is an incident of racial profiling per se. Davis cops have a history of making work for themselves when none exists, but what Davis cops definitely need is some cultural sensitivity training. From personal experience I have seen how Davis polices lack of cultural sensitivity can exacerbate a normal, harmless situation. Sure if you have the talk and the walk of a white suburban resident you will be fine, but throw an immigrant, person of color, or even a young teenager and a little bit of misinterpretation and you get a nasty situation. They are inadept at handling such circustances. In fact, it seems that any profile outside the norm evokes Police paranoia and suspicioun as in this case. As if the Buzayans were trying to pull the wool over the cops eyes by playing off the mother as the daughter...psh give me a break.  Users/AbdolhosseinEdalatiSarayani

20060413 22:07:26 nbsp It must be tough being a police officer.  Youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont.  You guys are probably the same people who complain that there is never a police officer around when you need one.  Yet, when the police do their job you complain they should stay out of your business.  A hit and run occured whether or not restitution was paid.  Just because this rich girl was able to pay for the damages she caused does not mean she did not commit a crime.  A crime still occured.  Please reserve your judgment until both sides of the case are heard.  I know more about this case then I can say at this point, but I can tell you that there is very strong evidence that this honor student is lying through her teeth.   Users/NancyGrisby

  This supposition without evidence isnt very helpful to anyone, rather it is simply demeaning to the student. Agreed on the police point though; they must respect the established laws while striving to maintain law and order at the same time. TR

  What other side can there be when the only two parties involved (the Buzayans and Adrienne Wohof) both consider the matter settled to their satisfaction? Users/KenjiYamada

  In the words of Melville...Ah, my dear fellow, you cant fool us that way you cant fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him.  It must be tough being a police officer in Davis, what with virtually no real crime and no way to use all that training and equipment.Users/GrumpyOldGeek

  Well, that depends on what you do and what you don’t. If you are a police officer and you “do” abuse your authorities and taxpayers resources that are entrusted to you, then you should be damned. And if you “don’t” use your authorities and taxpayers resources that are entrusted to you to do your job in enforcing law and maintaining order then you should be damned.

  “a hit and run occurred whether or not restitution was paid”, “a crime still occurred”, “
.does not mean that she did not commit a crime.”, “I know more about this case then I can say


.there is very strong evidence that
.is lying through her teeth.”  Can you tell me specifically, with no need to get into details, which of the case documents did you see to come to these conclusions including your judgment that “the honor” student committed a “crime”. From Dan Noyes reports there is not a single person that was involved in the case testified that he or she saw a hit and run. The socalled witnesses stated clearly in their statements to your “cop of the year” that there was no physical contact between the two cars (review Dan Noyes reports linked above).  Also a registered mechanical engineer and a reputable expert on car collisions wrote his report testifying that the damages on the two cars don’t match (review Dan Noyes reports linked above). Well, I don’t have as much access to evidences about this case as you seem to have, but if what you know is as critical as you claim it to be then please bring it out so at least I can make sure that I stand on the right side of the issue. From what I know though, it is a clearcut case.

  As for the girl being rich, that does not have anything to do with the case what so ever. You do not need to be rich to pay 870 dollars of restitution, as a matter of fact, all what you need is to be a law obeying driver that carries the minimum liability insurance required by the law. What takes a lot of money and courage though, is to refuse diversion and to choose to fight for your constitutional rights even when your opponents are as powerful as the city and the county in which you live.Users/AnisSury

Sorry about the bad grammar, if there is any..   Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060421 00:45:18 nbspCommenting on the case dismissal based on “civil compromise”, to me, the out come means three things

1)	Halema is innocent, that is a fact. I do not have any kind of legal experience, but I believe that this fact is based on Halema’s very basic human right of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Before the judge had dismissed, Halema was a suspect but she was never guilty, however, now that the judge has dismissed, Halema is innocent PERIOD. People who still try to cast doubts on her innocence are, in my opinion, in a way disputing her basic human right of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

2)	The dismissal was based on civil compromise. That means that the judge determined that the government had no business interfering in this case beyond the point where the police had facilitated the exchange of information.

3)	By his dismissal of the charges against Halema, the judge neither exonerated nor convicted the police, city officials, and/or DA. That is simply because none of these public officials was on trial, therefore, exonerating them or convicting them was beyond the scope of the court in that session. However if the Buzyans decide to file civil lawsuits or criminal charges against these public employees for any reason such as constitutional violations, law violations, or any other misconducts or criminal activities, then these public employees will be on trial, and only the outcome of their trial is what is going to determine whether or not they are guilty as charged.

Picking up from comment number 3 and reflecting back on comment number 1 above, my guess would be that if Halema is entitled to the basic human right of being innocent until proven guilty, then the public employees should be entitled to it as well. However, regardless of any court ruling and aside from the matter of innocence and guilt,  “public employees” bear an additional burden of providing good explanations and justifications to the public when authorities and money are used in controversial ways. In this “fender bender” issue, the continuous failure from the part of the involved public officials in communicating with the public in a convincing and transparent manner is one of the major factors that drove the public concerns to become so serious, and drove the public comments to be so critical.Users/AnisSury
  The statement innocent until proven guilty isnt a basic human right. It is the status attributed to suspects on trial in the United States. Indeed, in some other countries it is the reverse: guilty until proven innocent. Tushar

20060502 16:12:34 nbsp Is there still a gag order on this case?  Im just curious.  If there is, can Officer Pheng Ly still have a website defending himself and his actions. The website is www.officerly.com.  Oh, by the way, NancyGrisby is really Officer Pheng Lys sister named Nancy Ly.  Shes hiding her identity and is defending her brother.  I received some emails from people in Sacramento that Nancy is trying to rally up her community to support her brother on May 2nd at the Davis City Council meeting.  My understanding is that their Hmong commuinty doesnt support them because they feel its not about racism but about an individual who violated another citizens rights. Users/PattyShire
  That just lowers her credibility even further. You dont defend someone by hiding. Good for the Hmong community, they have the right mindset. Users/TusharRawat TR

20060509 09:14:58 nbsp Per Officer Lys letter to the Editor  Cal Aggie 5/9/06, the tapes that were posted on the Davis Enterprise website were removed at the request of the family.

20060509 10:05:27 nbsp question Users/BrendaRodgers Im confused about the confidentiality issue. If the parents willingly went to the media (Their daughters name and face were shown on TV) why are they now seeking confidentiality? Im not being argumentative, Im really wondering.

20060429 01:47:26 nbsp I read the information (Users/DavisPublicServant)  posted on the Halema page (See http://www.daviswiki.org/Halema_Buzayan/Yolo_County_DA%27s_Office Halema Buzayan / Yolo County DA) and also listened to the police tapes on the Davis Enterprise.  I understood that Judge Warriner had ordered that the adults involved in Halemas case were to follow the law regarding juvenile confidentiality.  Can the Yolo County DAs office decide on its own that these laws no longer apply to a particular juvenile?  Whats to keep this from happening to other kids in Davis?   Users/SharlaDaly

20060429 01:49:08 nbsp Maybe we should now remove the Halema page or at least edit out all reference to her identity. Users/SharlaDaly

20060429 08:31:50 nbsp I believe that Halema and her family waived their right to confidentiality. Users/WilliamLewis

20060429 08:55:41 nbsp I dont believe a parent can waive that right for their child and the Court ordered that the Defense and the DAs office were to follow the confidentiallity laws.  Juvenile files are not to be even acknowledged.  This does not bode well for juveniles in Yolo County.  I think that they should rotate out the DAs assigned to juvenile cases and reassign them to adult criminal cases where confidentially is not something that needs to be grasped.   Users/SharlaDaly

20060429 15:43:13 nbsp Id imagine that parents, since they legally represent their children, and that children have no legal rights (short of against abuse and other direct criminal acts) against their parents unless emancipated (that is to say, given their own legal identity), are wholly qualified to waive confidentiality rights on behalf of their children.  Furthermore, if the parents werent of the same party (ie representing their children fully), THEY would not have access to the confidential files either.  Suffice to say, I would say unless someone cites something authoritative that says otherwise it is not safe to fiat I dont believe a parent can waive that right. Users/KrisFricke

20060429 18:43:37 nbsp Even if the parents give their permission for the release of information, Juvenile Court has to approve it.  There is a process.  See http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID3607458072+0+0+0&WAISactionretrieve California Code  Welfare and Institutions Code Section 825830.1  Releasing confidential juvenile information to others not on a very specific list and for very specific purposes is a misdeameanor.  From what I read in the paper, the DDA made a request to be allowed to release information about the case and it was denied by Judge Warriner.  The order was for everyone to follow juvenile confidentiality laws.   Information that the DDA released is extremely confidential and, it is assumed, damaging to the child, including the juveniles birth date, where she goes to school, her drivers license number, description, names and birth dates of her 3 siblings.  Why the DDA did this, I cant fathom.  Essentially, she is asking the community to become a huge police oversight body.  Or, maybe the DDA just disagrees with the Judges adjudication and hopes that this will result in something that approximates her sense of justice in this matter.  That is something to think about  Users/SharlaDaly
 I cant access the link provided but this is one of the dumbest things Ive ever heard! So parents cant release confidential information about a child but somehow if the government asks a public school for possible military candidates the school must release such information?
    I am not referring to the parents or the juvenile releasing information.  The District Attorney did.  The child and her parents can do anything they want, but the Officers of the Court cannot.  What is so dumb about that?  Heres the website to find the code: http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html.  Search for Juvenile confidential under Welfare and Institutions Code.  Look for Section 825830.1   Users/SharlaDaly
     Oh, wow. My bad. I completely agree with you on that. I must have read it wrong or something... sorry. Users/TusharRawat TR
     Hey I just read sections 825830.1 and I didnt see anything that answers the specific question at hand  could you provide a more specific citation?  Also, as per your restatement above I am not referring ... The District Attorney did. I think that mischaracterizes the subject at hand, as the subject is the parents or juvenile authorizing the DA to release information, which essentially is in fact essentially equal to the parents or the juvenile releasing information. Users/KrisFricke
      See section 827.9.  It is not clear that the DDA petitioned the Court to release confidential juvenile police records to the Davis Enterprise and received authorization from the Court after an objection period prior to doing so.   The DA/Halema page says Yolo County District Attorney’s Office has determined that...the office can now talk about the facts of the case with the public.  I dont think that the DAs Office has the power to go against a Court Order to follow juvenile confidentiality laws, regardless of whether they anticipate an objection from the parents or not.  I am not trying to divert attention from the issue of whether Officer Ly acted in good faith or not.  As a parent, I am just alarmed that the DDA can release very personal information about a juvenile without permission from the Court.  This is really important.  I dont think the DDA has followed the law here.  If they release the information to the juvenile and she released it to the press, that would be different, much as I find that equally alarming.  Users/SharlaDaly
          Sharla, you are correct.  First, the family always has the right to release any information they want.  The laws are set up to protect the juveniles, not to protect the police (note that was in one of the KGO reports from their legal correspondent.  Second, the DA was not released from this agreement when the case was dismissed and in fact, there is a possibility the family could file for sanctions.  They are most concerned with the fact that the DAs office apparently never removed personal information such as phone numbers, birth dates of minors, drivers license numbers, etc. from the family from the tapes.  Thats a serious breach of privacy.Users/HenryBianco

20060512 23:14:22 nbsp Contrary to what has been suggested, the familys side has not been publicly presented.  The familys lawyers have declined to provide specific responses to Pheng Ly and the District Attorneys comments, on the grounds that the judge has not given them permision to do so.  Users/LawJuvi

20060613 16:30:42 nbsp In September 2003 I wrote to Police Chief Hyde congratulating him on being named to his new position and I told him I hoped he would clean up the Davis Police Department. As someone coming in from outside the organization, I hoped he would make some positive changes and get rid of some of the individuals who did not measure up.
The “Hit and Run” case demonstrates that Mr. Hyde has done very little to improve the performance of his staff. The fundamental problems are
there is too much dishonesty coming out of the department
there appears to be no review of the officer actions,
supervision is sorely lacking and
there is an obvious tendency to bully young people.
The complaint, described above,mentions Officer Ly’s “bizarre conspiracy theory”. This is not the first time Davis Police Officers have arrived at bizarre conclusions – they dream these things up and no one up the chain of command bothers to determine if the conclusions make any sense.
