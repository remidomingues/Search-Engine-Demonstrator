20080510 18:30:18 nbsp It seems that the Hallmark Inn has undergone a series of upgrades over the past year. Ive stayed here several times over the past two years, and last weekend when I was there I discovered that the big old televisions in the rooms have been replaced with wallmounted flat screen TVs. This is a welcome change as the old televisions were the annoying type where theyd be extremely loud every time youd turn them on. The phones have also been replaced, Im pretty sure the bedding is new, and there is definitely new paint on the walls. Overall this place is a lot nicer now than the last time I was there, which was actually just last summer. Users/OscarSabino
