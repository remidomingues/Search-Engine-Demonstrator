Halloween is a Holidays holiday that is well celebrated in Davis. The modern spectacle of October 31st is loosely based on the Celtic Religious and Spiritual Organizations pagan celebration of death and rebirth known as Samhain (meaning November). The original festival occurred on the 31st through November 1st. In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Catholic Church attempted to Christianize the festival by producing the consecutive substitute holidays, All Saints Day and All Souls Day. Modern Halloween is therefore a weird amalgamation of Celtic paganism and Catholicism. Most recently, commercial interests and pop culture references have also had a strong influence. In Davis, some pagans and occultists still celebrate Samhain, but like most American cities, Halloween is primarily a secularized holiday in which people dress up in outlandish costumes and children go trickortreating.

The Catholics also tried to suppress the indigenous Aztec holiday that is now known as Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). Due to some perceived similarities to Samhain, the Catholics changed its original August date to correspond with All Souls Day. Hugely popular in Mexico, Dia de los Muertos is also celebrated by some Hispanics in Davis.

You can get costumes at Goodwill or on campus from the Department of Theatre and Dance Drama Department. Other thrift stores in town may have a small Halloween section. Departed costume shops include: Halloween Headquarters, Spirit Halloween, Xtreme Halloween, Halloween City. Note: in 2013 there is no temporary Halloween store available in Davis.

The Davis Downtown Business Association runs a TrickorTreat Downtown sometimes known as the Downtown Halloween Treat Trail.

When Halloween draws near, some people like to visit the Dixon Corn Maze. (The one in Woodland no longer exists, apparently.) There does appear to be one in West Sacramento at http://www.vierrafarms.com Vierra Farms now, though.

Pumpkins are closely associated with Halloween.

20091029 22:09:31 nbsp I remember my first Halloween haunted house experience. I was sixish and went into a church(!) gym blindfolded, along with dozens of other kids. Had to stick my hand into bowls filled with icky things...like worms and eyeballs!! (Read: spaghetti and peeled grapes.) Users/robinlaughlin

20111006 11:12:13 nbsp Driving by from a distance last night it looked like theres a Halloween store going in where Borders was.  I didnt get a good look.  Anyone have any details? Users/TomGarberson
  Saw it a couple days ago, amazing how fast it moved in.  Of course, Im sure it will move out just as fast on Nov. 1.  Not sure when it opened, but the Enterprise apparently hasnt caught on yet: http://www.davisenterprise.com/business/halloweenstorescreepintodavis/  Users/OldDavis73

20111011 10:27:51 nbsp I didnt have any trickortreaters last year when I lived over by the cemetery, even though it wasnt a studentdominated neighborhood. How the heck do I know whether to buy candy or not? How do parents decide where to take their kids? Should I put up decorations to signal we want trickortreaters? Users/MeggoWaffle
 Always buy candy!  Worstcase scenario: you have to handle the entire bag yourself, rather than just the leftovers.  Thats hardly bad news! Users/TomGarberson

20111011 16:06:33 nbsp Anybody know where any haunted houses or worthwhile decorations will be? Id like to put together an interactive map (without driving up and down the grid for an hour, wasting time and gas). Users/justincox22
