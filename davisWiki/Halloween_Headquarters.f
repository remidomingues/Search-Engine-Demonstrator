Halloween Headquarters is open seasonally, from the month before Halloween to a couple days afterwards. Everything is half off the day after Halloween.  In 2009, the store opened for the season at the beginning of September.

The 20072009 location is address(912 5th Street, 38.547455, 121.738495), across the street from Dairy Queen.

2010 marks the first year many will recall as not having a Halloween Headquarters. The former location at 912 5th Street has been sealed off for construction for months and no replacement location has been found. It is rumored there will not be a Halloween Headquarters in the future in the city of Davis.

Past locations include the current Ink Monkey Graphics location, the old City Hall that is now Bistro 33, the current site of the Dollar Tree in the Davis Manor Center and previous site of Ralphs and Albertsons, and the current site of Rite Aid on Russell (previous site of State Market).
