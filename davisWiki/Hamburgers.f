20070816 18:58:17 nbsp I cant claim to have tried all of the burger places listed.  But my current favorite is Crepeville  a goodsized, good quality burger, served quickly (not fast food fast, but faster than Redrum Burger, which is not saying much).  Plus, if you get it with salad instead of the potatoes, the salad cancels out any unhealthiness of the burger.  Really. Users/CovertProfessor

20070816 18:58:28 nbsp Ali Baba, handsdown!  I havent tried all of the burgers in town, though.  If you can stand the wait, and possibly of getting a terrible burger from an apathetic employee, Redrum Burger rocks, too.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
 Indeed, Ali Babas burgers are very flavorful  I have no idea what makes one burger more flavorful than another, but the one I tried (cheeseburger with mushrooms) was. Users/CovertProfessor

20070817 00:52:04 nbsp Ali Baba makes great burgers.  Hands down, seconded!  The feta is yummy, the mushrooms are plentiful, the bacon is thickcut.  White and wheat buns, and they also make the same burgers with chicken (and I think they do have a salmon burger).  Users/EdWins

20070817 02:17:01 nbsp Most of the gourmet burgers around town are good, but their toppings mask the meat as if theres something to hide. Maybe there is something to hide, like a knuckle or a misplaced tooth. I dont know. What I do know is that the mushroom burger at Ali Baba blows away the competition. Theres a good quality bun, its really big, it hold together well, and the toppings bring out the meats flavor. Theyll take orders over the phone, so theyre a great burger option if youre on the run. One note of caution if you have a stick shift, the burger is far too juicy to eat while driving. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070831 09:36:05 nbsp I think Tommy Js Blue Buffalo burger is the best burger in Davis. Aside from that specific burger, the patties are homemade; good size and taste. He also likes to talk to each customer and get feed back which creates a very welcoming atmosphere. Redrum Burger is a crap shoot, like Phillip said above. I also enjoy Sams Mediterranean burgers on occassion.   Users/JamesSchwab

20070925 19:56:01 nbsp As for burger... I think that Fords Real Hamburgers in Sac is best for nonchain, InNOut for chain and Harris Ranch 1/4 pound patties from Nugget the best for some home cooked cheeseburgers. Users/atwong

20080203 13:22:35 nbsp Im still looking and picked up some good tips here. Redrum is underwheling with an overwhelming bun and soggy fries. Dais Bistro is not bad. Im originally from Anaheim, so hey, Carls Jr. is not a bad burger. Double Del at Del Taco is a decent fast food burger. Right now my vote goes to Burger Habit. Expand to West Sac and go to Hefty Burger for the real deal.  Users/DavidFeliz

20080805 08:48:07 nbsp The Graduate has the best burger Ive found in the US.  Ive been to maybe 50 places (sports bars and restaurants, not fast food places) around the US.  The burger/beer combination is the best unbeatable, with so many types of fresh draft beer (they pour enough that the beer rarely goes stale). Users/dwlotter

20121102 01:44:15 nbsp The best burger I ever had (so far) was one at the Roseville Galleria earlier this year. Im not joking. One of the eats at the food court is a miniBuckhorn. Dont know if its related to the Buckhorn in Winters, but it probably is, judging by how good my blue cheese burger was. It was cooked to medium well perfection and was just the perfect amount of greasy.

But, Ive also had a burger from almost every single place listed on here. My top 3 are, in no particular order, Ali Baba, Cafe Bernardo, and The Graduate. I havent tried Tommy Js yet, though, which I hear is really good.

Burgers and Brew, while good, is quite overhyped IMO. Users/CecilioPadilla

20121102 02:46:56 nbsp There are only a couple places left in Davis that I havent tried for burgers, but so far Tommy Js has the best burgers by far. Way better than Burgers & Brew. Users/ScottMeehleib
