Lloyd Hamman is a general contractor carrying out home additions and remodels. He is a perfectionist, a problemsolver, dependable, and reliable.  Im placing this as a satisfied customer, because he remodeled our house in East Davis a couple of years ago. It was a complex, architectdesigned job with some unique features that Lloyd tackled with resourcefulness and good humor. At some points we made changes or decisions on the fly or at a late stage, without additional costs  something that many contractors would not tolerate. Thoroughly recommended.
