Hans Tailor was quiet little tailoring tailor shop tucked away behind The Mustard Seed. It was little hidden but if you walked around in the complex, youll find it. This place offered alteration services at very reasonable prices. They could do an alteration in a short period of time, and they could do it well!

Mr. and Mrs. Han retired on May 27, 2011. The store is now Sarahs Alterations and Eco Cleaners.


20060214 18:32:35 nbsp Han did a great job with a pair of my jeans...In fact, its the only pair of pants Ive had altered that Ive been able to wear afterwards.  He got the length just right, for around $8 I think.   Users/DeterZamboni

20060214 21:23:02 nbsp Ive gone to Hans several times for dress trouser alterations. They are always good. Users/MattJurach

20061109 12:35:05 nbsp My first experience with him was horrible!  He lost a pair of my jeans and gave it to another one of his clients and all the while was increasingly rude.  He has not customerfriendly.  DO NOT GO TO HANS TAILOR. Users/JayneDoeson

20061128 12:38:49 nbsp I dont think Han speaks much English, but his great tailoring makes up for his reticence.  I think hes much better than Mahins Alterations on G street, and cheaper too!  Hems are $8 and taking the waist in is $15.  Thats super cheap compared to getting an original hem done at Mahins for $25.  I would give him tips if I were not a poor college student.

20061211 23:38:03 nbsp Hans English not so good but his needle speaks fluently. Great work from an experienced old guy. Users/TerencePhan

20061220 12:37:04 nbsp Fast turnarond and great prices. I took 1 pair of pants there to try it out, now Im taking everything there. Users/NelsonConley

2007711 21:31:04 nbsp Ive been taking clothes to Han for about five years. Once I found him, I havent used anyone else. Its a funky little shop, but dont let that put you off. His work is very good, especially for the prices. And if you bring in several items at once, you can end up paying less than if you bring them in one by one (Ive discovered this over time). I highly recommend him.Users/RobinLaughlin

20070810 23:40:12 nbsp Took 4 jeans to him to get hemmed. Took only one day! $8 each. Funny/nice man.  Users/klutzy

20071108 18:41:13 nbsp I went in with a vintage jacket to be fitted.  Hans discussed with me what could and what couldnt be done to it b/c of strange construction.  I appreciated his honesty.  He was quick, inexpensive ($11) and did a great job.  I will return for hem work and other minor tailoring.

20071127 11:00:59 nbsp I brought my D&G blazer I just bought to him and Im not totally happy.   It just doesnt look as fitted and sharp as I wanted.  Not to knock on Han but perhaps he just doesnt have this type of experience. I think I may have to go to Saks or Neimans to get it done right. Users/atwong

20071207 16:19:18 nbsp Han does a great job with hemming, but I was most impressed with his work fixing holes in a cashmere sweater.  The shoulder of the sweater got caught on something and there were two tears in it.  Luckily I saved the thread that came with the sweater, and Han (actually, I think it was Mrs. Han) did such a good job that I cant even tell where the holes used to be. Users/SugarPlum

20080228 15:22:07 nbsp This was my first experience with a local tailor here in Davis and I went to Hans based on the reviews of his expertise and general personality. I brought in 3 dress shirts (2 express, 1 CK) to be fitted around the waist and the arms. In short, I was more than just happy with the results.  Taking a close look at the stitching, it was apparent that Han still knows what hes doing at his old age.  Users/synker

20080228 15:57:13 nbsp Ive never been to a tailor before since I always did my hemming myself, but since I no longer have the machine nor the time, I wanted to get them done by someone. I brought a pair of black loose dress pants, a pair of slacks, and a pair of jeans to test his hemming ability on different types of fabrics. He is a quite gentleman but has an underlying sense of humor. He really wants to make sure the job is done the way you want it, so not only does he make you put on the pants before getting them altered, but after he has finished his work as well. He informed us as we were leaving that he was raising his prices just slightly. His hemming would now cost $10 instead of his previous price ($8). I didnt really pay attention to the rest of the prices, but they were still pretty reasonable. I loved the work that he did on my pants that I will definately bring more to him. I also got my bf interested in going there himeself. Users/UnhappyStudent

20080725 10:14:14 nbsp I went to Hans based on the good recommendations here on the Wiki and I wasnt overly impressed.  I took a dress that needed a new zipper, just a regular 16 inch zipuptheback zipper from the waist to the bottom of the shoulders, thats it.  He looked at it and told me I needed to buy my own zipper and then bring it back because he didnt have one.  I had no idea where to get this and he told me I needed to go to Woodland or Sacramento and find a fabric store which I did thanks to the Internet but I thought it was odd that a tailor didnt have a zipper.  After I got the zipper I took it back in and while it was done in two days, it cost 20 dollars on top of the 5 dollars I already paid for the zipper plus my time and gas out to Woodland to buy it myself.  The seams are not hidden which isnt a big deal in terms of the aesthetics of the dress but it let me know that the work wasnt excessively difficult or in a delicate material (just plain cotton) which I thought was a bit high considering the range of prices for hemming and what I suspect is more laborintensive alterations. I guess thats the cost of not knowing how to sew yourself but I was not impressed that he made me get my own materials; I dont have to bring my own food to a restaurant for them to cook it.

20081011 12:36:16 nbsp I took a pair of jeans to Hans to have hemmed.  He is quick and cheap, however you had better hope that you dont have any problems.  I wasnt totally happy with the job he did (one hem was sloppy), so I brought them back to have him fix it.  He was incredibly rude and yelled at me never to come back.  The final job that he did was good, but I will never be returning.  Han is very rude.    Users/mczinn

20090101 13:40:04 nbsp I went there to get my jean hemmed and he was soo rude of the way he measured it and i told him i wanted it to be longer but he kept saying that his measurement is a good height and so, i decide that its probably no problem because he knows more than me. When i got my jean back and tried it on it was too short. Pissed me off soo much! Ruined my jean that i just bought. Never ever going back there AGAIN!! and he did a very sloppy job! Users/vangr0z

20090411 09:45:03 nbsp He should just call himself a hemming specialist and not a tailor.  Did a good job hemming pants but refused to do simple alterations on a dress and top that other tailors did not have any problem altering, because they were too complicated.  Changing rooms are not kept clean, there was a cockroach in one. Users/JTan

20090504 14:33:03 nbsp Great prices, very neat hems. Cant comment on his tailoringIve taken all my jeans and dress pants in to be hemmed, and Im always very pleased with the results. Love that he matches hem thread colors to the original accurately; I usually cant tell the difference on my $200 jeans.
Very friendly (Im a regular customer), I think Ive only seen him once slightly annoyed maybe because of a bad day? His shop is usually very busy, but turnaround time is fastusually 2 days for my jeans. Users/ViVi

20090608 14:20:51 nbsp Hans did an amazing job on a bridesmaid dress and it only took a week! It was a complicated job requiring letting out a bit here and taking in alot there, and it looks fabulous. He did a detailed fitting and it shows in the end. I am much happier with Hans work then with Mahins. A+ Users/CGall

20090904 21:12:29 nbsp I took a pair of scrub pants there and he did a good job at hemming, but I guess he only did pants for $8 in 2007. It was $10, which made me sad. He wasnt the most social, but wasnt really rude either. Good job, but I think Ill just wait til I go home for my mom to do them next time. Dont want to spend $10 on a pair of pants I only paid $13 for in the first place. Users/Ilovetacos

20090919 08:48:40 nbsp DO I HAVE YOUR PANTS????
My husband went to pick up my pants on Thurs (Sept 17) and mistakenly got a pair of mens pants.  He brought them to me in Boston (long story) and only then realized they are mens pants and not my pants.  Email cjm98125@yahoo.com and hopefully we can straighten out.  I will call Han on Monday when he opens.  We have worked with Han many times and always been very pleased.  I believe this was a rare mistake (hopefully).  Users/RaissaDsouza


20090928 18:23:34 nbsp Meh.  He did a good job, but it was quite expensive.  $35 each to tailor two shirts and $20 for a very simple hem job.  He also wouldnt do a trickier pair of pants; I think Ill try Mahins. Users/Meemsie

20091103 18:38:14 nbsp Does a great job for all of your tailoring needs. As for his customer service, you have to get his attention because he is always concentrating really hard on making sure he does not make a mistake. He also does not speak fluent English, and thus may be the reason why he doesnt talk that much. Users/IdealParadigm

20100106 23:43:27 nbsp I went to Hans again a few days ago to have some pants tailored. I would have to say that he is an absolutely great tailor. It seems that he didnt understand what I was saying, but I think thats because he does not speak as much English as he can understand. I left the store thinking that he didnt quite get what I was saying, but when I came to pick up my trousers, every single pair was tailored exactly how I wanted it. Users/IdealParadigm

20100204 22:37:10 nbsp I brought my jeans to be hemmed a couple of weeks ago and I was extremely satisfied with the job that he did. He was really friendly and asked me what shoes I usually wear them with and whatnot. Even though its a bit expensive ($10), I will definitely come back here. Well, unless I being able to hem my own jeans very well and not be lazy to do it myself. Users/snsdgee

20100222 20:59:15 nbsp Has anyone had their jeans patched for rips/tears at Hans or any other tailor/alteration place in Davis? Users/ARL589

20100618 12:24:04 nbsp kinda pricey... but its competitively priced as far as i know.  i go to hans for all of my shirts and jeans.  i dont really know whats involved, so his muteness doesnt bother me.  he hasnt failed me yet, and i think im up to 6 shirts tailored and 4 jeans hemmed. Users/oneortheother

20100701 15:13:59 nbsp A friend of mine had an AWFUL experience with Hans.  She went to get a pair of pants altered, and he took measurements on only one of her legs, and one of her legs happens to be slightly longer than the other, and when he returned the pants, she requested an adjustment on one of the legs.  He proceeded to yell at her for this and said it was her fault when he failed to take proper measurements in the first place.   Users/ChrisDietrich

20110315 17:12:10 nbsp He did Velcro for a patch on my flight suit. He did it in 30 seconds and insisted I not pay him. I bargained that I Wouk pay him a dollar. Great guy, please support his business Users/MattCorey

20110423 11:25:59 nbsp I thought the price was kind of high, but when I got my garment back I was really impressed. I will use Hans services more in the future, and consider altering rather than just buying something newwhich seems to be the trend these days. Users/BrentKago

20110506 12:40:37 nbsp He doesnt do leather

even if its just a zipper


sounded nice thou, but quick to inform me that he isnt down Users/StevenDaubert
