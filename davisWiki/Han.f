20070918 21:10:47 nbsp I may not be a wiki moderator, but I know that negative comments should not be deleted, even if you dont like them.  If I deleted negative comments Id be working on the Rite Aid page, believe me :)  At any rate, its not fun seeing negative comments, but if they exist, so be it.  We ask you not to delete negative comments, even if you dont like them. Users/AlexanderHo

20080425 23:05:13 nbsp There are some techniques you can use to improve the Dianas Nails page. For instance you could add some more information about your accreditation and licensing. Link to an article like http://www.nailsmag.com/feature.aspx?fid360&ft2 this that talks about the regulatory control your salon is under. Upload some photos of your better work and maybe the store.

Or go another direction and create a page with information that Nail Salon customers need to know and include a link to http://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/. Either of these routes will be more productive than deleting comments. Users/JasonAller

20080624 10:06:44 nbsp Uh, Han... you cant just remove negative reviews like that.  Its not only obvious, it makes you look like youre trying to cover stuff up.  You might want to read the causal, informal Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide to the wiki for business owners. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080803 17:19:09 nbsp Posting fake reviews about your own place to make it look good is NOT a good way to make people like you. Users/BradBenedict
