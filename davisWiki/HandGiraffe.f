Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the comment to Silverstone.  I was concerned with a few parts of it, and posted a reply on the Silverstone entry.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101121 13:03:38 nbsp No worries... I removed my comments when you removed yours.  My concerns were solely about a reasonable concern stepping over into a personal attack (mocking or personal info).  Your actual concern about the guy seems completely appropriate given the behavior youre describing.  If hes staring in your window, its reasonable to want some answers. Users/JabberWokky
