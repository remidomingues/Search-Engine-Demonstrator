This is the most splendid little Gift Shops gift store! If you love handmade, oneofakind clothing, you will love this place. They have cotton and wool clothing and accessories (even handmade felted slippers!) that are colorful, authentic, affordable, and made in Nepal. Prices for tops are $35$45 (These are really high quality! Cotton, handsewn, richlydyed, embroidered, each one truly unique). The owners are really nice (family owned and operated) and the atmosphere is peaceful, uncluttered, and welcoming. A taste of beautifully creative culture.
