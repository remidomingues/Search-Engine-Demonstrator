The http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22111.htm California Vehicle Code recognizes several hand signals. In Davis they are mostly used by bicyclists.

  Left arm straight out  signals a left turn or lane change
  Left arm out, hand pointing up, or right arm straight out  signals a right hand turn
  Left arm down at 45 degrees  signals a stop

Other (unofficial) hand signals include:
  Raised middle finger  You nearly killed me because you were trying to get the yogurt out of the bottom of that cup, please pay more attention to driving
  Thumbs up  Thanks for putting that cup of yogurt down while you were driving and waiting for me to cross the street.
  Peace sign  general acknowledgement of each others existence, or thanks for letting me go first.
