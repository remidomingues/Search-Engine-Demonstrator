 Hand Turkey 


Hand Turkey (or HT as the kids call it) was formed in 2003 when two musicians (Users/ImranKhan Imran Khan and Users/JoherKhan Joher Khan....no relation) got together and played music in a cramped apartment. Imran plays guitar and sings while Joher plays the drums and also sings. Their love for punk rock created their new sound. This new sound really sucked. So they went back to the drawing board and wrote some better songs. One day they may actually play a show infront of a real (non stuffed animal) crowd.
