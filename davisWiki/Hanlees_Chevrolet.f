20080807 13:51:48 nbsp Hi, my name is Adam England. I am the Parts Manager for Hanlees Chevrolet. In July of 2006 Hanlees Chevrolet moved from Hanlees Toyota to its own dealership, located at 4989 Chiles Road. Its in the same lot as the new Hanlees Nissan.

20080809 12:38:52 nbsp I took my Dodge Durango into the Hanlees Chev store because it had a General Motors extended wty on it....they gave me no trouble at all working on my Dodge, I asked them if they honored other Aftermarket extended warrantys and they told me yes....I had a very wonderful experience at the Chevy store....they were very knowlegable and always kept me informed....they now have all of my business.

20081003 20:11:55 nbsp They are great if you are under a warranty... but I was severely overcharged when taking my vehicle in for service after the warranty. I was charged $52.25 for a free engine code readout, and I noted before the service that the gas cap was the proximate cause of the light anyways. Total ripoff. Users/ChristopherPrice

20081103 19:01:15 nbsp Hello...just to say I took my Pontiac in for an exhaust leak...Iwas told by another dealer that itwas my manifold est to repair....about 1500.00...I wanted to get a second opion...it was a crack in a attaching pipe to the manifold....total cost for repair...275.00...I did not mind spending 52.50 for diagnose even though I knew the area of concern...Hanlees saved me over 1000.00 dollars....
Thank you Hanlees for taking the extra time to correctly diagnose my car...very much worth the 52.50

Thats 2 cars of mine that have been repair correctly at Hanlees...

20090305 08:15:19 nbsp I am never going back to the service department again. The guy was rude, asked me what I need help with in the what the hell do you want tone, without even looking up from his computer screen. I walked out when he wanted to charge me $109 for an oil change and tire rotation on my car. Users/ahsu

20090407 12:36:54 nbsp The service department is horrible. My Chevy truck had a manufacturers defect, covered under warranty.  Hanlees told me that I was partially covered, would have to pay for labor, and the parts were ordered and that theyd call when the parts came in (~4 days).  When I hadnt heard back in nearly a week and a half, I called several times with no one answering or returning my phone calls after leaving messages. Same was true through email.  Finally I talked to someone there who told me the parts had not been ordered and wouldnt be ordered b/c the defect was not covered.  I brought my truck to Mike Daugherty Chevrolet in Sacramento and within a few days, not only was the truck repaired, but I was not charged a dime...  Users/RMC


  Often times comments like one above (horrible) are opinions given when someone doesnt get their way. For every one that says horrible there are 100 satisfied customers. I know this because I am the fixed operations director for all 6 of the Hanlees Dealerships. I would invite RMC to email me with some facts surrounding their situation and I would venture to guess that some pertinent information is missing from the above statement. If RMC would email their contact information including phone number I would be happy to investigate the actions of my employees and resolve the issue. Otherwise, there is not much I can do with an anonymous posting. Thank You... Gerry.Quinlan@Hanlees.Net


    Gerry, why not let people discuss stuff in a public forum? First, you claim that pertinent information is probably missing... how could someone not get their way on a manufacturer recall? One that another dealership fixes without incident? Plus its odd that you would chose to resolve the one service situation (out of three complaints) where the customer already had reported that the issue was resolved... when they took their problem to another dealership. I would suggest that Hanlees improve service (since that is where most of the complaints appear to come from), and work with each customer as if they arent intentionally omitting information.

    But based on your conduct on Davis Wiki, I would advise anyone going to Hanlees service to bring a tape recorder with them. Then there wont be any potential for accusations of omitted information. Users/ChristopherPrice

Christopher, I have no problem discussing stuff in a public forum. Knowing the information that is missing would be important for me to determine where this situation went wrong. Last 8 digits of the vin#, year and miles, name of our employee who seemingly dropped the ball etc. From there I can gather the rest of the facts and would be happy to respond here in a public forum. I reread the original posting again and I dont see any mention of a manufacturer recall. I live and work in a world where facts and details are important. I am trying to improve our service offering and that is precisely why Im here. I dont need to, nor am I accusing anyone of anything. The information I need to respond to this person is clearly not there in the posting. As for my conduct on Davis Wiki please let me know if I failed to be polite and proper/courteous. I thought I had at least accomplished that. Thank you for prompting me to clarify further.

20100227 11:19:49 nbsp Eric the service manager and Adam the parts manager went out of there way for me.  I was told by a Sacramento dealer they couldnt get the part for me.  They sent a driver to get it from another dealer becuase the part is on back order from GM.  Thank you for giving the extra customer service guys!  It didnt go unnoticed:) David Reed, El Macero, CA.

20100324 12:30:00 nbsp Theyre having a sweepstakes contest from 20100324 to 20100329, but you have to go to the dealership to see the winning number on the prize board; could someone post it here? Users/SteveDavison

20100324 16:20:10 nbsp I just went in to redeem my prize because the numbers matched on the advertisement they sent me (granted, all numbers probably match). Anyways the number for the grand prize of a $10,000 debit card is: 100756. The number for the $1,000 cash prize is: 101799. And the number for the $100 cash prize is: 110320. But if your number doesnt match any of these they still give you two gold dollars. They swarm you in the parking lot and instead of just walking in to look at the numbers you have to sit down with a sales person and listen to the carbuying deal they have going on. But hey, two bucks is two bucks... Users/jennymiller

20100624 20:15:05 nbsp I visited Hanlees service today, the man was polite, not friendly, but my jaw dropped when he told me it would be $100 for a synthetic oil change! And 10 bucks a quart for mobil 1 is an outright LIE. That is insane and price gouging. I went here for convenience, not to be bent over. I said no thanks and left.  Im all for supporting the local community but its not good either that the employee didnt try in any way shape or form to earn my business once I was already there.  Its sad to say that hanlees chevy has lost my business indefinitely, especially seeing how the gentleman in the above post spoke down to the customer who is voicing an opinion. In a very public form that is most unwise for your business bottom line.  Users/CARedStar

20101020 22:32:07 nbsp Melinda from Hanlees reached out and made an effort to fix my issue. I appreciate her professionalism. First time a dealership earned my business! Users/CARedStar

20101021 16:36:09 nbsp They told me theyd call when the parts came in for a repair. But then they didnt. So I ended up having to wait an extra day before we could get the repair done.

I know thats not a big thing, but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way.... Users/daviself
