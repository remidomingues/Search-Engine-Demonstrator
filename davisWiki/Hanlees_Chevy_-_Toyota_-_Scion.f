Hanlees no longer has multiple car dealerships at 4202 Chiles Road. There still is Hanlees Toyota/Scion, but the Hanlees Chevrolet dealership has a separate new location. The new wiki pages should be more uptodate.

I dont have the exact figure, but I was astonished when I saw what percentage of city revenue comes from car dealership taxes. I believe it was over 50%. Davis, believe it or not, is a car dealership town.

20060809 07:32:33 nbsp I purchase a 2006 Tacoma truck from Hanlees’s in Davis…..story to be continue….  Users/TedHolm

20051214 08:38:18 nbsp Have had a couple of really bittersweet experiences w/the maintenence department at this dealership.  Bitter in that the end result/quality of their work is hit and miss, but sweet in that the General Manager is easy to get a hold of and seems willing to bend over backwards to correct any mistakes.  Ive had my car come back from them with the wrong parts, or scratches on the paint job... while the problems were quickly corrected, I wont be going back.  Users/MikeDavidson

20060225 10:34:14 nbsp I just bought an 06 Corolla two weeks ago from this place and I had really great service. Everyone was really friendly, especially our main dealer. We liked him so much we treated him out for pizza after the long hours of papersigning (because he was so nice and because he really hooked us up by knocking $2000 off the price of the car).  I got an oil change recently and they claimed it was gonna take an hour but it only ended up taking 20 minutes. I really like this place. Sometimes I think of just stopping by to say hi to all the people, lol.  I highly recommend it!  Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060322 17:21:46 nbsp I bought a 1995 GMC Jimmy from Hanlees in September 2004. http://sworker.us/jimmy/index.php This vehicle should never have been sold to me, let alone been on the Hanlees lot.  In the course of owning this vehicle, over $9,000 has been spent on repairs, luckily a large part of it on an extended warranty.  The service department has made mistakes in repairs (a transmission replacement error cost me a tow back to Davis from Vacaville) as well as overcharging compared with other places in town.  Their 30,000 mile service is quoted at roughly $500 compared to $89.99 quoted by Johnnys Service.  I urge people to stay away from the Hanlees dealership.  Users/StevenWorker

20060407 19:52:19 nbsp Today I went to the service department of Hanlees for a 25,000 mile checkup/oil change/tire rotation. It took about 1 1/2 hours to complete, then again, I also went on a Friday afternoon so I didnt expect much better. Everyone was quite friendly and helpful. The lady in the cashiers office even saved me almost $30.00 off my bill, as she noted a misprint on my receipt. The main waiting room is small and crowded, so I went into the leasing/purchase room (at one of the many circle tables) and read for class. Relatively quiet with comfortable chairs not such a bad place to get some work done while you wait!  Users/StacieTownsend

20061115 21:22:32 nbsp Today my roommate came in with a list of work that the service department told her she needed for her car. She went in for a brake job and a door handle replacement, they quoted her 1107$ including front brakes, rotors, serpentine belt, tensioner, brake fluid flush (119$!!) door handle and oil change. They didnt even take off the rear tire to check the condition of the rear brakes, as she complained they were squealing. Luckily her roommate is an engineer and works on cars daily. Her serpentine belt was relatively new, the tensioner was not failing, a brake fluid flush... well come ON! 119$??  I guess the old addage about getting work done at a dealer holds true in Davis... or at least for females!!  Users/BethSolik

20061211 13:13:27 nbsp Hanlees quoted $198 for a Prius 25000ml service, with a rude attitude by the service manager. Miata in Sacto did it with a friendly face for $49 with using a discount oil change coupon. You figure.  Users/TomFrendl

20070319 08:13:40 nbsp I had blew a new tire and wasnt sure about the auto policy/warranty I had purchased for my new camry at capitol toyota in san jose so I went to ask about it at the dealership at Hanlees.  I was greeted by if not the exact words of one of the fleet managers, You see, if you had bought the car here we could have serviced it for you. Instead of going out to buy a car for the best price you couldve bought your car here in davis for a small diff in price and we could replace your tire right now.  Put what he just said on repeat x2. After trying to make me regret buying my car for the best price he directed me to Leschwab tires which was next door. Despite the small context of this exp and the general view of dealer attitudes this experience definately gives bad rep to Hanlees. Oh and this was said to me in front of their other dealers.

A month and a half ago I was in the market for a Toyota Tacoma, so the first place I went was this dealership in Davis. After showing me their selection of Tacomas, it seemed that they didnt have exactly the combination of options and colors that I was hoping for, nevertheless I needed a truck and I wanted to see what kind of offer they would give me. On that first day, they tried to get me interested in a silver extended cab truck with a scoop on the front. You know those things on racing cars that help their air intakes get more air  well they look dumb on light trucks. Yeah, Im cool, I have a racing scoop on a tacoma that doesnt do anything! It seemed that they bought too many Tacomas with scoops and couldnt sell them, so they offered the scoop thingy free of charge. It looks dumb  I dont want it even if its free!
After telling me a delightful story about a man who bought a sweet car on the spot with cash and drove it away tipping his hat, and how cool that was, Pete went through a gutwrenching process of figuring out whether or not I would qualify for their 0% financing offer. I say gutwrenching, because every unconvenional answer was met with condescension and they didnt seem to understand why I was in their office. Over and over again, I had to repeat that I wanted to compare offers from different dealers, and they kept going, huh? Finally, I left with them processing my credit application. Apparently, Users/ArielaHaro Ariela and I would have to cosign on the lease, which is bizarre because by herself she doesnt have any credit. And my credit is very good. A few days later, I got a call saying that our credit went through, and that I would need to show up with a list of references. You know, people who know I exist.
I came in expecting to finally get an offer to use as a comparison, and Ive just got to say, if you dont remember customers, dont try to guess. My girlfriend was apparently now my brother, and I wanted a Carolla. This aforementioned list of references seemed to be a ploy to get me back in the dealership for a push. Without even looking at them, they decided to bring an asshole into the discussion. This asshole was also known in their outfit as the Sales Manager, (not Pete) but to me, he was an asshole. Without ever meeting me beforehand, or seeing the vehicle in question, he proceeded to tell me how this was the perfect vehicle for me. Liar. I would have preferred a white truck, without a stupid looking scoop. Next, he took a colored marker and a blank piece of paper and wrote out a cartoonish list of numbers, and wrote a line on the bottom and said Would you sign that here? What does signing my name here signify? That you will buy this truck Then Im not signing it. Im not here to buy the truck, Im here to hear your offer. This started a whole new line of explanation as to how I had this odd idea that I should get several offers and comparison shop. I mean, a Twentythousandplus purchase and I wanted to shop around? Then they forgot what I just told them and thought my girlfriend was my sister.
Maybe politeness kept me from walking away right there, but then the sweaty asshole, err, Sales Manager, said What would get you driving this truck home tonight? Nothing, Im not here to buy today. Round three of not understanding comparison shopping. They pressed me to find out where else I was looking, and I hesitated to give them specifics. What truck do you want, I have this, and that, and that... (Wait, is he admitting that the loopy scoopy truck is not the perfect truck for me?) So I thought to ask, with how many brands this guy has to sell, Do you have a Dodge dealership? Oh, you dont want Dodge, they have no resale value, they arent good... Liar again. Hey my dad knows all about good trucks, and Dodge are them, the fact that they dont make light diesel trucks is the reason why I was interested in a Tacoma. As I got up to walk out the door, the sales manager chucked another permonth financing plan at me, knocking off about $8,000 off the originallyoffered 10% financing option. Guess my credit aint so bad anymore, huh? Still not 0%. I left, because as I said, I wasnt buying that day.
Call me oldfashioned, but I think that people need to shop around when it comes to big purchases. Pressureselling means that you may buy something that you will later regret. Actually, Im not oldfashioned, these guys are. Thats what the guy who sold me my new truck told me, at Freeman Toyota in Santa Rosa. Yes, two days later I was 80 miles away signing on a white, doublecab light tacoma truck with 0% financing. With no cosigner. You see, what I didnt notice when these guys were trying to cram that scoop down my throat was that I was more comfortable with a doublecab than an extended cab. Having more options to choose from helps, but the way they tried to pressuresell was a big turnoff. Im not that rich guy who plopped down a wad of cash to buy a $90,000 car and drive it away, nor are most people. But people need to be treated decently and not pressured on important purchases. When you go into dealerships, banks, and other businesses, you deserve to be treated like that rich old guy.
Im very happy with my new truck, and I thought to drive up and tell them off at Hanlees, but it wasnt worth the gas. Instead in the mail, after another dealership gave me a great deal, Hanlees spitefully sends me a credit rejected letter. Wow. MegaAssholes. (Except for Bobby  he was nice.) I suggest that if you are interested in a Toyota vehicle, that you avoid this dealership. You wont have to go far to find someone who will let you make your own decision. Customers have all the power in the world over salespeople. Pushy salespeople will change their strategy when they stop selling cars that way. Users/KarlMogel

20070518 18:04:38 nbsp I brought my car into the chevy service department and I an NEVER going there again.  my car had an engine leak in it and they fixed that and called me at 5:00 the day it was done (they close at 5:30) and told me that they could not come get me because they wouldnt get back until 5:40 and i had just spend over $1000 there and they couldnt wait ten minutes for me to pick up my car, that really annoyed me.  The next day it took me three attempts to contact the service department.  The first time I called I was on hold for about twenty minutes and no one picked up.  The second time the lady that answered said that after 10 min of being on hold no one in service was available and would have them call me back asap.  an hour later they still did not call back so I called them and finally got ahold of them. 10 minutes after I had my car back I parked it and was going to move it and it wouldnt start.  They paid to have towed back to them on Thursday and its now Friday and not done.  They never called me to check in, I have had to call them about five times today to get any information at all out of them.  This problem never should have happened in the first place because they said that they checked out the whole car for any other problems it might have, but apparently they did not, or they didnt look very hard.  They guy I dealt with was also really sleezy, I did not like him.  I am never ever going back to this place again. Users/kateso

20070527 01:57:14 nbsp Salesman was extremely nice, got to test drive on my own, all pricing up front, and without hassle. Was convinced that the salesman was an honest, nice guy. However, later I mentioned the word price and he went ballistic. I told him I didnt agree that I couldnt get a car below invoice, and he thought I was calling him a liar and freaked out nicely. He later apologized, but he was very bitter with me.

Other places were about $1000 below Hanlees OTD, so called the salesman to say I was buying elsewhere unless they beat the price, to which the salesman replied: Do you want a new price? Ill give you a new price! $100 ABOVE INVOICE LIKE BEFORE, clearly angry. I didnt enjoy my experience at all, and ended up leaving feeling like I was somehow in the wrong for wanting a good deal.

Bought a car from Maita, which is far away but MUCH better. May reluctantly attempt service at Hanlee because of the convenience as opposed to driving 23 miles to Maita. I havent attempted this yet.

20071020 19:50:27 nbsp Went to look for a car there on Thursday. Had some problems. First that they had an 01 Prius under a sign for 5,999 which peaked my interest. Turns out it cost about 10K more than that. Other than a half hearted apology, I got no concessions. Had a salesman named Delorean (like the back to the future car) who was nice and seemed like a decent person for a salesman. The numbers just werent working for me and I asked for my keys (I was considering a trade in as well) and this burlier dude named Moses (could be the sweaty asshole talked about above, it sounds like him) walks out and starts trying to intimidate me. Previously Id had a good impression of this place, though that was with their service dept. Now Im thinking they are no better than anywhere else. Ethically questionable not for the price mixup per se, but for not taking more responsibility for it. The day after a lady in the sales dept. called me back, whether it was because the two guys knew I was unhappy afterward or whether it was because I walked out of there without buying, I cant be sure. She was slightly more apologetic. Im considering calling BBB to see  what the dealership is obligated to do when they advertise such a grossly inaccurate price. Ill update when I can. Users/AnthonySoto

20071218 10:27:55 nbsp Went in there last evening to shop for a new car. Should have looked at the wiki first. Not much has changed since the first review...or maybe something has: over the course of time, they have added racism to their repertoire. Users/13urningMonk

20071218 11:32:18 nbsp This place is horrible and the sales people are racist. I went shopping for a new car and decided to take my boyfriend. During a test drive a slow driver was in front of me and the Hanlees representative in the car with me said They must be Chinese. Chinese people always drive like that. After the test drive we were taken inside to talk about pricing since they refused to discuss this upfront. The sales person asked my boyfriend if he was Indian. He is Indian but I didnt see how that was relevant and he didnt ask me if I was Irish. We were then presented with a sheet of paper with some prices written down. When we said it was out of budget, the sales person asked what we could afford and I said $20K. The sales person then said If my boss says you can have this car for $20K will you buy it tonight? Of course we didnt say yes, this was the first place we visited and wanted to shop around for the best car and best deal. They sales person came back and said they couldnt work with us on the $20K so we got up and left. The representative who had accompanied us on the test drive and who also had an issue with Chinese drivers was waiting for us outside and began telling my boyfriend that This isnt India and you cant bargain here like it is. He also indicated that he had some Pakistani people in earlier and they were just as difficult as my boyfriend. I have never felt so appalled! I will never go here again and I highly encourage others to do the same. Users/consumeradvocate

20080111 13:17:57 nbsp Not too happy with them right now.  Brought our Chevy in at 8:30am this morning to replace a rear blinker light and told them we needed the car back by 1pm as I have to leave town for work.  At 1:10pm they told us it wouldnt be ready for another half hour.  They also told us that they wanted to perform a 30,000 check up/service for over $600 but didnt give us a breakdown of what needed to be done. Users/CindiDrake

20080115 13:17:57 nbsp After the Chevy portion of Hanlees dicked me around for three days and then backed out of the financing they told me I could get, I went to Hanlees Toyota and Scion.  The manager there John was nothing but helpful and friendly.  I graduated from davis a year ago and have had my job less, therefore I had been having a hard time getting financing at american car companies, which aernt really set up for recent college grads.  John gave me a recent college grad discount even though i graduated over a year ago, and got me financed at 7.5% which is damn good for a first time buyer with minimal credit.  My experience there was wonderful and I now have a new scion.  Apparently John and his team came in to the Davis scion toyota dealership to clean up the place as they had an unusually high number of complaints.  They fired everyone that worked there previously and brought in his team.  They are trying to build back up the reputation and heal old wounds so if you got dicked around on there before go back adn tell them and im sure they will help you out.  I am really pleased with the new staff. Users/AllanRae

20080217 08:02:36 nbsp just bought a 2008 SE V6 camry from hanlees in davis yesterday.  the folks there were fantastic.  i had been to toyota of marin to check out the same make, and was getting highballed on the price, lowballed on the tradein, and generally treated pretty terrible.  hanlees didnt have the exact car i wanted, but actually drove to berkeley to pick one up, and return with the correct car.  apparently they are under completely new management, and were extremely courteous the entire day.

20080321 10:15:52 nbsp I went to have an oil change.  I left terrified to drive my car.  They told me I needed extensive work done, including having the alternator replaced (I later found out it was just a belt that was squeaking), and my tires would fall off while I was driving and I would die (yes, they actually told me that).  After 3 days of not driving, my boyfriend finally talked some sense into me.  It has been over a year later, and my alternator is fine, and my tires havent fallen off.  Needless to say, I wont be going back. Users/JennyG

20080416 22:44:17 nbsp I JUST FOUND OUT TONIGHT THAT THESE FOLKS AT HANLEES ARE THE ONLY DEALERSHIP TO STEP UP AND DONATE $30,000 DOLLARS TO SAVE TEACHERS JOBS IN DAVIS. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED UPPER MANAGEMENT IN EVERY LOCATION AND HAVE COMMITTED TO TAKE THE BEST CARE OF CUSTOMERS. WE ARE GOING IN THIS WEEKEND TO BUY A NEW AVALON. BY THE WAY, I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE TOYOTA LOCATION FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS NOW AND HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE PROBLEM. THE DEALS ARE FAIR AND THE MECHANICS ARE SECOND TO NONE. I HAVE COME TO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THESE POSTINGS ARE PERCEPTION AND NOT REALITY. SOME OF YOU REALLY NEED TO GROW UP. ONE OF YOU SAYS THEY ARE RACIST, HAVE YOU BEEN IN THERE? THEY HAVE EVERY RACE COVERED IN THEIR STAFF. LETS BE FAIR HERE FOLKS... Users/donniq

20080528 11:39:46 nbsp I worked for the Hanless Chevy a five or so months ago it was horrible, management was a joke and they treated people horribly.  I would never buy a car from here period. Users/dnm12

20080601 16:50:27 nbsp I was disappointed in Hanlees Toyota the last time I went. They were normally helpful. I went in because my clock didnt work and my boyfriend went to get his light fixed on our cars. Well they told us they would call us when everything was ready, but they never called so we had to finally call them and they didnt fix either one but didnt bother to call us and tell us the estimate or anything and they were about to close. When we went to pick up our cars, they couldnt figure out why my closk wasnt working and wanted to charge me over 400 dollars to fix it by putting a brand new one in. When all it was, was a shortage.  Users/KaylaCassell

20080715 19:44:32 nbsp If you say something, then why wouldnt stand by what you say.
Question, deferred payment means: not cashing a check until the deferred date.

So why was my check cashed.   Maybe so my account could then be overdrawn and I would be slapped with overdraft fees.  All because I believed that deferred meant, you will not cash the deferred check until the deferred date.  Surprise, not Hanlee’ Toyota in Davis:

True story, Hanlee Toyota sell man and finance dept. persons both said, dont warir, we do this all the time, do what!  cash the check before the deferred check date.  And when you call back to ask about it, those same people cannot be found, even worse, they hangup on you.

20080726 07:38:17 nbsp This is a car dealership.  The people are annoying, it takes forever to make a purchase while they bombard you with all kinds of options you dont need.  Theyre no different from any other place.  After buying a car here I dont ever want to go through the process of buying another car again.  Does it really have to take 5 hours to buy a car?  Really?  No it doesnt.   Users/JimBob

20081008 13:26:30 nbsp I have had a similar experience to several other people here. Service mailers come with great sounding deals, but when you get there the price goes up for some reason or other.

20081116 20:32:51 nbsp I was interested in the possibility of a new camry one day, and i had some time on my hands so i decided to stop by hanlees toyota in south davis to see about options, specs, etc.  I parked my volvo in the guest lot and immediately had a man wearing soiled clothes not say a word to me, but right in front of me come up and walk around my car looking at it as im guessing a trade in.  i dont even have to imply it was a bit creepy & annoying.  But i walked onto the lot and looked at an le when i soon had the attention of a sales associate.  He answered most of the questions i had but didnt know a few of them.  I took the car for a test drive around chiles road just for a minute or two and when we returned to the lot the salesman looked at me and said, bluntly so, you want to buy it?.  It was difficult to even resemble a response i dont think i did i just got out of the car, went to my car, and left.  While toyotas are toyotas, and the way i was treated at this dealership OF COURSE doesnt say anything about the quality of toyotas or scions (which, I still believe in), University honda is a world away theyre professional, courteous and decent people.  Not saying honda is better than toyota, but in this case univ honda is so much easier to deal with.   Users/Chrissapher

20081117 08:10:29 nbsp While car buying is rarely fun, its a little easier when only dealing with people over the phone and internet initially. I have to say, I didnt have a great expereince with many of the Sacramentoarea Toyota dealers except Elk Grove Toyota. They were so honest, it was almost shocking. In the process of buying an 08 Prius, we delt with Maita, Roseville, Davis, Fairfield, Stockton, Tracy and Elk Grove. Only Elk Grove could come in at the outthedoor price we requested with all the features and color we wanted. They didnt play games and made the process as easy as possible. After we bought, I noticed almost every new Toyota (still w/ dealer plate) I saw in the entire region was from Elk Grove. I wouldnt waste my time dealing with Hanless again. Users/AmLin

20090217 16:37:35 nbsp The best car buying experience I had.

I would recommend this place to anyone. Though their friendliness was almost overbearing, I think it was better than the slime I dealt with in Elk Grove and Roseville. I came her fully expecting the same treatment, but was pleasantly surprised.

Our sales guy, Les Eales, (slimy name, nice guy) was the best.

I told him my price range and he stuck to it. When I started to drift towards cars out of my budget, he would remind me that the monthly payments would be higher and tried to encourage me to buy a car that wouldn’t kill me financially. He also gives great test drives. He explained everything in the car to me, including how the ABS brake system worked and everything on the dash and whatnot. Then he stopped my 06’ Hyundai Sonata dead in the middle of the road and floored it. The car peeled out and we were doing 80 down the road outside the dealership. And this guy is ancient! It was hilarious.

And they treated me great through the whole experience – even after I turned down their shitty Chevy Cobalt that I testdrove for 2 hours. (Not that their Cobalt was shitty – just that ANY Chevy Cobalt is shitty) I also didn’t notice any of the racism that some people previously mentioned. My boyfriend, who came with me, is Hispanic, and one of the newer salesmen there was some sort of East Indian. Turns out my boyfriend even knew the guy from high school…but anyways, I think things have changed here since some of the previous reviews. I would very much recommend this dealership to my friends.

Also turns out my boss and several family friends bought their cars there and had the similar experiences… Users/Devakii
