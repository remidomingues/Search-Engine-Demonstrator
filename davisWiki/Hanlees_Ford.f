20080915 20:07:03 nbsp Beware! My $26.95 oil change coupon turned into a $95 oil change. All kinds of hidden charges and additions that were never mentioned in the coupon nor by the service manager were added to the bill  for example they automatically put in synthetic oil and some special $35 oil additive that was explained to me as a labor saver  huh? Lame excuses why they did this. The coupon is a  phony (only covers regular oil which they do not even carry) and their business practices shady. Go anywhere but here if you want to be treated honestly and up front. They treat you like some idiot. Maybe I am for going to Hanlees Ford! —DavRes Users/DavRes

20081008 13:26:49 nbsp I have had a similar experience to several other people here. Service mailers come with great sounding deals, but when you get there the price goes up for some reason or other. Its nice to spend money here in town, but is it worth getting ripped off? I think not. —JasonSR Users/JasonSR

20081105 18:48:56 nbsp I went here today to have work done on my car.  Greg took care of my car... explained everything to me before the work was done and let me know the cost up front.  I would definitely come back in the future for regular maintenance or other services. Users/fedexgurl

20090521 13:29:11 nbsp Went here a week ago or so for an oil change. Everything went smooth, it was quick and decently priced. Will definitely come back. Users/pontus
