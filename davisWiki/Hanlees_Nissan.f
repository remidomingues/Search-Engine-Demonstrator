20080825 16:29:16 nbsp What a nice and clean dealership...I walked over to look at it while my car was being repaired at the Chevy store.....Its nice to know there are dealers who really care... Users/PBarringer

20100224 13:24:12 nbsp The new service manager Joe is very honest and easy to work with. There has been no Ford dealership in Davis for some time now so the Ford postings here seem irrelevent. There is a shop at the old Ford location called Davis Auto Care and they do great work. Joe is honest and will always show you the part if something is needed beyond the regular servicing.

20121127 16:29:20 nbsp First, before I describe my terrible experiences at Hanlees Nissan Davis, I would like to state that I will never spend another penny there and I would strongly recommend against anyone else spending any money at Hanlees Nissan in Davis.

I own a Nissan Frontier and have taken my truck for repairs to Hanlees Nissan in Davis twice over the past 4 years. My first experience, around 2009, was average. However, my second experience, a couple years later was significantly different, in a very negative way. I am not sure if there has been a change in management or what exactly, but I would forbid against going to Hanlees Nissan in Davis for any reason. Let me describe to you my experience:

The timing chain in my car broke and the service manager at Hanlees Nissan was adamant that the engine was damaged from this incident without even looking at the car. The options that the service manager presented to me were: (1) take the risk the engine was not damaged and change the timing belt for $1200. If the engine had been damaged, this would be a waste of $1200 and the engine block would still need to be replaced. Or, (2) take the safer but far more expensive approach and replace the entire engine block for $7500. With severe pressure from the service manager, I decided to replace the entire engine block in my truck for $7500. I picked up my truck and everything seemed to be working fine at this point.

Not too long after having the entire engine replaced in my car at Hanlees Nissan, my car was due to be smogged. My car failed the smog due to the engine ignition timing being off by 10 degrees. Apparently, the timing being off this far on an engine is extremely detrimental to the engine. After finding out this information, I went back to Hanlees Nissan and explained to them the problem. They claimed that they had timed the ignition when they installed the engine and that the engine ignition timing failure was not their fault. However, Hanlees Nissan had no written proof that the engine ignition was ever timed; therefore, I am fairly certain that the engine was indeed never timed and Hanlees Nissan was trying to get out of doing the morally right thing.

Instead, the service manager offered to take a look at my truck for $99, and then adjust the timing for an additional $50 to $100 on top of that. Instead, I went to a different reputable autoshop in Davis and had the work done for $47.99. Users/DanErikson

This clearly describes their poor commitment to their customers. Users/DanErikson

20130128 12:02:33 nbsp A few months ago, I bought a 2011 Rogue with approximately 30,000 miles on it from these jokers. The sales experience was smooth, easy, and relatively pleasant ... but after that, things went downhill fast.

First, there was less than one gallon of gas in the car, which we didnt realize until after we signed the papers. Guess what? Service was closed  they couldnt gas it up for us. We live in Sacramento, so this wasnt enough to get over the causeway. Im glad I noticed or that would have been a biiiig problem. As it was, I paid to fill it up, thats fine.

There was one key available and Hanlees didnt have a key machine to get a new one, so they wanted me to come back to get it. I live 20 miles away but they wanted me to drive the 40 mile roundtrip for a key at some future date. Sue, the manager, claimed shed call me when it was in. I never got a call. I sent a fax, a letter, and 3 emails  all without hearing back.

A local repairman and friend takes a look at the car 2 days after I buy it and tells me its woefully out of alignment, badly needs a tuneup, and is low on oil. Wonderful. At least the brake pads were in relatively good shape, although they werent new.

A week after buying the car, I get a call from Nissan USAs customer satisfaction department asking how things went. I tell them the truth: that there was no manual included, just one key, the ipod cable  which I was told was in the glove comparment  was missing. A new one of those is $80 online!

The Nissan USA guy said these were serious issues, that Hanlees was required to give 2 keys and a manual minimum with Nissan certified vehicles. He claimed hed deal with it. I never heard back from Hanlees, although the guy from Nissan USA called me back to tell me that he had communicated with the dealership and told them they needed to take care of these issues ASAP.

Finally, I decided just to show up on my way back from the Bay Area one day to get the key and the other things they had promised to give at a later date. I get there and have to stand outside the managers office for 17 minutes  I checked my watch  while she talked on the phone ... and it was a personal call, nothing whatsoever to do with dealership business from the side of it I hard. Lots of talk about what they had for lunch, weekend plans.

1 hour and 45 minutes after walking in the door, I had the manual, the second key, and the plastic cover for the rear seat hinge  which had been missing, and which caused my 4 yr old child to get a foot stuck.

I started to drive away ... and realized that even though they had promised the ipod cable was hooked up, it was missing. Drove back. 30 minutes later I had the cable  apparently it was lost in the Indiana Jones warehouse and it took 3 staffers a half hour to find a single cable.

The incompetence and rudeness were staggering.

But thats nothing.

I took it to a body shop 2 weeks ago for a small scratch that someone made in a parking lot. Luckily the person who bumped me paid for it. While I was there, the body shop guy took a panel off and showed me lots and lots of damage from at least one previous accident  bent flanges and mounts under a rear light, frame damage, broken clips that were to hold on the bumper, and some very messy repairs. None of this had been disclosed by the dealer at the time of sale.

So make your own decision: if youre alright with this kind of treatment, feel free to buy a car from Hanlees Nissan. I should have stuck with Volkswagen  I would have paid more for a similar car, but at least Id have amazing service. At any VW dealership  especially Niello, which I bought my previous car from  all of these things would have been delivered to my house the day after the sale if they hadnt been available at the time I drove off. And theyd never NOT gas up the car.

Buyer beware! Users/JLT
