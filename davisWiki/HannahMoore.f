Im Hannah.  I like things.  I also wrote/drew the comic Gum on Asphalt for the California Aggie during the 2003/04 and 2004/05 school years.  People liked it and they didnt.  Sometimes I even forget that I ever did it.

I graduated with a B.A. in art studio and now work in something mostly unrelated.

I have a website athttp://curiouszoology.com Curious Zoology.
