Office: The Quad

Characteristics of the Beast: Often barefoot, quite loud, can be found singing along to bad 80s pop behind the counters in the ASUCD Coffee House. Incredibly unapologetic for the insulting traits she possesses, i.e. an affinity for real talk, being a woman (and Jewish!), and a joint Sociology/American Studies degree. The audacity!

 Fun Facts 
  Once the cops thought she had been murdered at The Colleges. She had not.
  G St. Pub is her favored venue.
  Allergic to onions. No, really.
