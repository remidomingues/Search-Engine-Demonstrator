20120822 03:46:14 nbsp I gave you a comments box so I could tell you to bug Users/mikeycp Mike because his page needs more bugging. Users/ThomasReeder

20121119 15:23:58 nbsp Everything was written by people like you, and it all depends on people rewriting and adding to keep it viable.  So dont ever worry about editing anything on a page.  The worst thing that could happen is that somebody disagrees and theres a discussion about what should be there... which is just part of people working together on a project like the wiki.  Feel free to edit and add to the wiki: its your wiki too! Users/JabberWokky

 Thanks so much! I read a lot of comments and see a lot of mishaps so Im super wary of editing pages, but Ill be a little more confident! ht

best Buffalo wings are made and bbqed. Wing Time sauce was originally out of Davis. Best method is Everett and Jones yellow top + Roadhouse Spicy thick and chunky + wing time medium or hot usually 1:1:1 they turn out really good on the bbq. Should make them for the next wiki bbq... Daubert
 ...I...Im a little confused but Ill try making some :o ht

20121119 20:54:36 nbsp Chicken Wings  best wings restaurant in town is Sudwerk IMO, although Froggys is also quite good.  Village Grill is up there, but pricey.  The Grad is always a good bet, too.  If you dont mind traveling a bit, Pyramid in downtown Sacramento has fantastic wings.  Best Ive ever had. Users/TomGarberson
 Thanks so much! I havent had Sudwerks yet, nor Froggys. The Grads are decent. I wish I could get there, but Ive only got a bike so its within Davis for me now. Thanks for the recs!  ht

20121120 11:29:02 nbsp also re vitos: If something significant changes with the restaurant by all means edit the page and reflect that in the body of the article. No more burgers is noteworthy so dont feel afraid to jump right in and share. Cut that comment bar out has some musings that might explain more Users/StevenDaubert
 That page is really useful! Thanks for the notice! I felt it was a pretty dramatic change, and immediately my thoughts went to changing the wiki page. Thanks!  ht
