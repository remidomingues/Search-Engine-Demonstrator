Winter Performance 2012: The Nutcracker Ballet

The Hanneke & Co winter performance of The Nutcracker Ballet has been a Davis favorite since 1987. Come join us in celebrating the holiday season by watching Hanneke & Companys ballet production of the Nutcracker! Set to the Tchaikovsky’s classical score, the story follows Clara on her magical journey. A Christmas tree that reaches great heights, a fight between ferocious mice and fearless soldiers, an enchanting dance of snow, and an exciting adventure through the Land of Sweets…this ballet has it all.

Heres a review from the 2009 performance. http://criticontheloose.blogspot.com/2009/11/nutcrackerfeaturearticle.html
