20060107 10:42:38 nbsp Hanover Place Apartments are very nice.  Theyre pet friendly, maintain the grounds very nicely and the management is very friendly and responsive to any issues that may come up. Users/CindiDrake

20070908 20:26:12 nbsp Hanover Apartments are well managed and an excellent place to live, especially for graduates and families.  Very quiet and clean.  Trish, the manager, is easy to talk to and fixes problems promptly.  We got our entire security deposit back within 8 days even though our apartment was still kind of messy.  Highly recommend unless you like to party, in which case you should probably avoid this place.  Our lease wasnt renewed because we were too noisy.  Users/Glotar

20080128 16:59:42 nbsp This place is great, I currently live in a Studio across the street.  My only complaint is that you are not allowed to have pets in the studios.  When I moved in everything was really clean, and the carpet was only a few months old.  I had a light out on my balcony and it was fixed within a couple days.  They give you a small discount if you resign your lease, but its definitely really well priced for Davis regardless.  Its also right next to the bus stops and the save mart, which is really nice.

20080826 14:45:33 nbsp I am moving into Hanover Place in a few days. I am very excited! Anyone else moving in/live there? How do you like it?
So far the Landlady has been very very nice and answers all of my questions! Users/Natasha

20080914 20:47:23 nbsp I just moved in too!  I like my new apartment so far the only thing that bothers me is that the cabinets in the kitchen are too high and that the water temp. is too hot.  Trish (Apartment Manager) has been really nice and Im pretty happy to live here. Users/Magster

20090329 16:03:37 nbsp I lived in the studios across the street for seven years, mostly quiet and clean.  Trish, the manager is outstanding and deserves more recognition for her work!!!  The elevator is great for moving and theres no apartments beneath.  Shopping close by is great, however sometimes a spotty neighborhood. Living near the ally can be quite noisy with the trucks.   For the value perhaps a one bedroom would be better living.  Could be immensely more enjoyable if pets were allowed Users/mikelong

20090525 02:22:24 nbsp what are the 0910 monthly rent?  Users/ashna.singh

20090624 18:11:17 nbsp We lived here for a year. We can not say enough good things about this place and Trish. She is the best manager, responds very quickly to any issues you may have! It had a lovely fireplace(in some units) and a great walk in closet(in some units). We would have stayed longer but with 2 people and 2 dogs our 1 bed room got a little cramped :) I highly recommend this place but get put on the wait list early since it usually fills up by late February.  Users/NtoWolves

20100511 12:12:27 nbsp Ive been living here for about 9ish months and this place is awesome.  Trish is beyond amazing, very nice, very helpful, super quick to respond to problems and genuinely seems to care about any problems/issues.  The apartments are nice and super quiet (with a few VERY rare exceptions).  The only thing thats kiiiinda loud is the savemart trucks that do stuff and the recycling place across the street dumping large buckets of bottles.  But thats only an issue if you live like right next to the street I think.  But the apartments are ridiculously close to shopping and the G and J lines and one other line (F I think?).  Basically these apartments are amazing.  Im moving out next year and THE ONLY reason Im doing that is because my puppy is outgrowing the apartment so Im moving to a house.  Live here.   Users/alpmille

20101011 05:52:18 nbsp Lived there last year, but left because of management changes. New owners came in and drove Trish out, jacked up the rents, then started charging for water. The apartments arent individually metered, so you get to pay for your neighbors water who takes hour long showers. With all the changes, these apartments really arent worth the price. You know an apartment complex has jumped the shark when they drive out a manager as wonderful as Trish. Users/paradox

20101011 09:52:09 nbsp Kerrie the new onsite manager at Hanover Place Apartments and Hanover North Studios is doing a wonderful job of taking care of old maintenance problems that were needed.  New tenants moving in and current tenants are finding that if they have a maintenance need that it is taken care of in a timely manner.  In the past rents were normally raised every year as were other apartment complexes in the Davis area, however, this year due to the owners decision to bill for water and sewer, rents were restructured and the rent raise was minimal to absorb the extra utility costs that would be incurred.  For tenants that had been there for many years rents were raised to current market rate.  In lieu of these raises long term tenants were offered new carpet and/or paint. If you drive by this property you can tell that it shows the owners Pride of Ownership and that quietness and cleanliness is something they strive for. They are a pet friendly community, and now have decided to allow cats at the studios. If you are a current tenant at Hanover Place or Hanover North please comment, would like to know what YOU think!   Users/pattimcre

I am renting a home that is part of the Hanover Apartment complex, and I use the pool at Hanover Apartments. As a tenant, I have known some Hanover Apartment tenants and on site managers as well as the Property Manager of all the properties for the past three years.  The owners planted so many large trees that the entire block is like a park. The trees provide coolness in the summer. The rents include landscaping of beautiful grounds. My experience has been that the Property Manager and owner are fair with their rent increases, given the high cost of utilities and maintenance in Davis. They respond quickly to repair needs and keep all of their properties in immaculate condition.  They are safety oriented, ethical, and maintain very high standards, implementing all the best practices of the California Apartment Association. It is a busy neighborhood with the shopping center, bus stops, and intersection nearby. However, the quality of the construction and the way the buildings, pool and grounds are well maintained, you feel lucky to live in such a beautiful, clean setting. I highly recommend Hanover Apartments to students or professionals who need a peaceful home near the university, with a feeling of nature around them. E.Emerson  Users/Eremerson

20101020 23:27:13 nbsp I lived at Hanover Place for a total of 3 years, in 2 different units. Trish, the previous onsite manager, was awesome. Kerrie took over now and shes also really nice and helpful with problems. The apartments are fairly quiet for the most part, this isnt where you would usually find late night loud parties. Didnt have too unmanageable maintenance problems  mostly water leaks, the building I stayed in seemed to have pipe problems. I loved the maintenance guy (I think his name was Mike?). He was pretty quick at responding, easy to talk to, and didnt mind explaining whatever he was doing. My only complaints have to do with the newest changes  they do now charge for water and sewage (dont know how much it is since I didnt stay here) and they no longer use the Davis Model Lease. I wasnt a big fan of the new lease. Late charges for rent used to be $10 for the first week, $20 for the 2nd, $30 for the 3rd (or something like that). With the new lease, if youre late for even a day, the late charge goes straight to $30. You also can no longer ask the manager in advance if you knew your rent will be late and schedule an alternate date agreed by the manager (which the Model Lease allowed). Continuous tenants no longer got a discounted rent either, so my rent wouldve jumped if I stayed. But overall, the location is super convenient and its really pet friendly. So if money isnt an issue and/or youre never late for rent, I recommend this place. Users/ZN

20110213 11:51:14 nbsp The bad:

1. pattimcre, whose comment is the third above this one, has a username very similar to the actual name of the owner of the property, Patti. If it was the owner, her comments should be taken with a grain of salt, since she is obviously financially invested in reviews.
2. I had some trouble getting my security deposit back when I moved out, but it was eventually sorted out. It was a Paperwork error, apparently.

The good:

1. I lived in HP for several years, and I moved out just after Trish (the last manager) left. She was well above average, as far as property managers go.
2. The new maintenance guy, Mike, was great at keeping me in the loop, and was always polite and professional.
3. It was very convenient to live next to SaveMart.
4. I would very seriously consider living at HP again. Users/PleaseDoNotUseANickname

20110712 12:31:38 nbsp WOW!  I really like this apartment complex.  The new Manager, Melanie, is very friendly and seems to take care of things quickly.  I would recommend this complex to anyone looking for a nice, small, quiet and convenient place to live.  The residents here are also very friendly.  Its easy to get to campus by bike or bus and the close shopping center cant be beat!   Users/AnnWilson


20120601 16:40:21 nbsp Full disclosure: Melanie (current onsite manager) asked if I would review my experience here. Im not a big wiki contributor, but was happy to do so because I loved living here. I tried to write an honest review though.

I lived here my last year in Davis, 20102011, after living in the studios across the street the prior two years, 20082010 (see studio page for my review). My friend and I shared a large, secondfloor, onebedroom unit facing the street. We would have gotten a twobedroom, but there werent any available by the time we asked. (Call to be put on a waiting list around FebMarch.) We were finishing up grad school and didnt know if wed be there a full year anyway, so it was fine. Two beds (one full, one twin) plus a large desk and a dozen filing boxes fit in the bedroom easily, and the walkin closet was more than enough for us to share.

I previously lived in a 4bedroom townhouse on Adams St. and a 3bedroom house on Oriole Ave. In hindsight, I would have lived here with a roommate in a twobedroom unit or across the street in a studio by myself for my entire time in Davis if I could have. Management here (onsite managers Trish, then Kerrie, now Melanie) was the best out of all of the places I lived  super responsive, friendly, and fair. Mike, the maintenance guy, was also really nice and good at what he did. I did get the sense, however, that their boss (property management? Im not sure) wanted to save more money than they did and would block requests for improvements that they made on our behalf. The place was wellmaintained w/ new appliances though, so there werent really problems.

Living space was generous. Plenty of counter space, large sink, dishwasher. We could fit a table in the dining area. We had a fireplace but ended up blocking it with the TV because we couldnt figure out where else to put it. Our living room held a large TV table, coffee table, futon, papasan, three bookshelves, and a screenedoff area for kitty litter. It takes multiple floor lamps to light the place. The fluorescent lighting in the kitchen was great though.

We fostered cats while living here. They let us have two, but ownership rejected a third. It was easy to add them to the lease. Melanie was also very flexible in accommodating our schedules for maintenance issues, since we had a skittish foster cat and preferred to be around if maintenance/management had to come in.

Being across the street from the shopping complex was amazing and made me realize how nice itd be to live in a truly walkable neighborhood. The apartment complex was very quiet, although there were occasionally noisy cars (stereos blasting) on the street. There seemed to be some party houses just south of the complex on the other side of the fence. We couldnt hear them from our unit, but I did notice when I was in the parking lot late on weekends. The units facing away from the street seemed really nice because of all the greenery and privacy, but not sure if they had to deal with this noise. There were also often police patrolling Anderson Place Apts. down the street, and a couple of weird violent incidents there... a fluke? Hanover Place was always nice.

The laundry room was clean and roomy with fairly new machines, although there was often a machine or two down for repair and some dryers werent very hot. We ended up going across the street to the Laundry Lounge most of the time, since it was about the same distance from our unit as the laundry room, comparable in price when we used the doubleload machines, and offered free transfer service.

Theres a pool and hot tub, but we never used them.

There was sometimes dog crap on the lawn outside our place, although this mightve been from people in the surrounding neighborhood, since it was a patch of lawn along the street. We always saw residents picking up after their dogs.

We did have some drama with the downstairs neighbor, but Melanie was very professional in dealing with it. On a related note, the floors are thin, so anyone sensitive to noise might not want to live downstairs. :P

We got all of our security deposit back except for ~$10 for some marks/holes on the wall. We cleaned a lot, but they dont seem to try to withhold unfairly. Melanie was really accommodating in terms of moveout/inspection times.

I wish I had found this complex sooner during my years in Davis!!  Users/LauraShih

20120601 17:10:31 nbsp I have lived at Hanover Place for 1 year and have loved it here.  The rent is reasonable and the management is kind and friendly.  I love that you can have a pet here and everyone is very friendly.  It is a quiet unit and the laundry facilities as well as the landscape area outside is well kept.  The walk in closets in the larger 1 bedroom is amazing!  I feel there is plenty of room for 12 people, as well as a dog or cat. Users/HanoverResident

20130214 10:50:33 nbsp Im a friend of one of the residents at Hanover Place and I will attest to the quietness and niceness of the complex, the awesome convenience of the Savemart shopping center, and the very friendly and quicktorespond management. Melanie is great! Users/StephHolm

20140124 22:14:51 nbsp Goooooooooooooooooooooooo Hanover Place Apartments! I am really happy to have lived here.  Its location is sweet, the apartment itself is clean, comfortable...and cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The neighbors are friendly but respectful and the manager, Melanie, is at the same time very professional and super friendly and welcoming. This is NOT some behemoth management company that only cares about getting its rent. Im flying the Davis coop, otherwise I would have stayed here longer! Users/Miki55
