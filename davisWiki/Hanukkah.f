Hanukkah in Davis has been represented publicly by Chabad of Davis, the Hasidic Jewish Orthodox organization. There has been the lighting of the menorah in Central Park, accompanied by music and a meal of latkes, the potato pancakes symbolic of the holiday. Hanukkah services are also held at the Davis synagogue, Congregation Bet Haverim. Judaica items, especially those pertaining to Hanukkah (dreidels, menorahs, candles, gelt or other types of chocolate, latke mix, and decorations), may be purchased at various establishments in and around Davis. See listing of places below. Image(menorah.jpg, 300, right, thumbnail, The second night of Hanukkah 2011 in Davis Central Park as represented by the second place on the menorah being lit. )
