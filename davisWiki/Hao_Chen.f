Professor of College of Engineering Engineering at UC Davis with a focus on Computer Security.  He is a very hardcore libertarian and constantly references The Simpsons, Desperate Housewives (somehow finding a way to relate it to programming), and Jon Stewart. He also enjoys making fun of nonscience and nonmath majors. Also bureaucrats and politicians. And students who whine.

If you take a programming class from him, you might end up competing against your classmates on a scoreboard that automatically grades your programs. For tests, he hands you the answers as soon as you turn it in so that you instantly know how badly you screwed up. There is also a story of how a group of students tried to turn in a project late and he stated he will accept the assignment if the group could collectively do onehundred pushups. Of course, since they were in a computer science class, they failed.
