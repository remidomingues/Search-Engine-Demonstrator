center(begin) Happiness Society
Welcome to the kickoff event for the Happiness Society.
We are organizing around the idea of finding Happiness
through giving and sharing.
Starting tomorrow, we will meet each morning
to play with unabashed enthusiasm for 30 minutes,
because we believe playing is the fist step to finding
the giving space within yourself.
Playing might be
skipping
jumping
running
searching
bouncing
singing
Learn to Dance dancing.
Playing might be anything our group dreams to do.
We will play, and we will take out playing
out into the world to invite others along.
Each afternoon, we will dedicate 30 minutes of giving
to something or someone that is important to us, as a group.
Giving might be
planting
filing
listening
supporting.
Giving might be anything our groups dreams to share.
Your are invited to come any day.
We meet at 8a.m. at the tree behind Wright Hall center(end)
