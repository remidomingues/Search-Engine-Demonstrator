When an individual becomes happy, the network effect can be measured up to three degrees. One person’s happiness triggers a chain reaction that benefits not only his friends, but his friends’ friends, and his friends’ friends’ friends. The effect lasts for up to one year.  Share and Stay Happy!

One of the benefits of being a business in The Happy Neighborhood Project is having your business showcased in the Happy Button.
