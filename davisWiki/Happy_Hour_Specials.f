 Davis Happy Hour Drinks 

Happy Hour is a period of time (not always one hour), usually in the late afternoon, on select days when restaurants/bars offer discounted (alcoholic) drinks. They differ from drink specials in that they are usually more broad; discounting most or all drinks instead of only certain ones. Additionally there usually is no cover charge to get in. Special drink nights often have a theme, for example: Sophias Service Industry Night. or Sudwerks Dollar Bottle Night.
