Harlows is a relatively nice dinner club/bar/music venue in Sacramento with a full service restaurant, full bar, large dance floor, & stage. Dinner is probably best described as California cuisine, meaning a melange of different cultures interpreted CA style. Unlike Davis bartenders, Harlows knows how to mix a drink yay!!. Theyll make those sweet  undergrad drinks if you want, but even those arent 90% corn syrup like at The Graduate. Tip the bartender well if you value a decent drink. Outside the club is limited seating along J Street, with patio warmers to keep the skirts and smokers warm. If youre an undergraduate students undergrad looking for a pickup joint, Harlows probably isnt your place  this club caters to a slightly older crowd.

Harlows offers a mix of music scene live music and DJ tunes overlapping somewhat with the dinner hours, usually starting around 9pm except on Sunday nights when salsa Learn to Dance dancing runs from 7pm to midnight. Check Harlows http://www.harlows.com/ website for a current calendar of events; some shows may be 18+. Musical genres offered cover a fairly wide range, from musicians such as Camper van Beethoven and Ricardo Lemvo to DJ dancing.

Upstairs is a small cigar bar called Momos, with DJspun house. If youre just looking to hang with friends over cocktails, Momos is nice, because its got a small fullbar and soft clean and modern furniture... not quite a retro fern bar, but it definitely doesnt feel like your typical nastyfloor vinyl furnished lounge.

20050807 23:37:53 nbsp Harlows is good, but drinkmaking here is not so far superior to Davis as to be noteworthy for that reason.  The scene is different entirely, and that alone distinguishes it.  Black Pearl, owned by the former owner of Harlows, is a far better place for exotic drinks. Users/JaimeRaba
