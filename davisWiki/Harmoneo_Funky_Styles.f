The Funk
It all started in Fall 2004 when Steven Lee and OJ Jones wanted to put an a cappella group together for Relay For Life (a fundraising event for the American Cancer Society). Gathering friends and auditioning others, a new a cappella group was formed. Just being called the Relay For Life A Cappella Group for the first year, they only practiced to perform at RFL so they were still unknown to the UC Davis campus. In Fall 2005, auditions came along again where the group gained some new members and lost some as well. The new group was determined to get gigs and have their name be known outside of RFL. Thus, Harmoneo Funky Styles was born (on March 31st, 2006)! We are a group full of such diverse students with songs that range from hiphop to movietunes. We are still a pretty new group but just as talented as the others here. We hope to get more performances out there and gain more fans. So without further ado, here are the lovely people that make up HFS!
