Ive traveled with him a couple of times on the Yolobus #42. I dont know if he lives in Davis, but he got off in Woodland. This colorful character looks like hes lived through hard times, like a hobo. Except that his suit and hat are spotless they look absolutely brand new (I did look carefully). The remarkable thing is that he pulls out his harmonica and plays music for all on the bus. Hes good too. The first time I rode with him he seemed disappointed that we were quiet after he played and said something about how we (the passengers) didnt appreciate his music. Realizing our rudeness, we all clapped. He really was good, which is why the driver freely lets him play. A true gentleman.
