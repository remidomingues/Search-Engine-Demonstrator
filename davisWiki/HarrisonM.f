My name is Harrison; I come from San Francisco San Francisco
Friends say Im crazy like Franco
Read Goethe, Tolstoy, and whatever
Twilight? Never
Take crazy hard classes.
I wear glasses
Sometimes I have to think of a rhyme.
Excuse me, this could take a long time.

(several minutes pass)

Dont text when I ride
or need a calculator to SURVIVE
Love lifes the antithesis of Tiger Woods;
Guess chicks dont dig dudes WITHOUT HOODS.

Going to be an engineer
BECAUSE MY LIFE IS LIVED IN TOP GEAR.
Oh snap its 2012
Haters gonna get shelved
You can say Im Johann Sebastian...

BACH BACH
ILL BE BACK!
Uh...

Yeah, thats about it for now.

Hes the guy who walks around campus carrying the two Kendo Club kendo swords in the duct tape scabbards on his back. He CAN use them but hes not good at them. By some random chance he will make a public appearance for the Fall rush at the UC Davis Bookstore bookstore as an employee. Please forgive his incompetence; the last job didnt have no fancy computerized cash registers as it was still stuck somewhere between 1983 and 2006.

He can also be found in the third floor of the engineering library pouring over the Car and Driver collection or snoozing at Shields. Dont bother him then unless its an emergency.

HarrisonMs opinions can be had in Yelp flavors too! He writes in a manner similar to the tone of this post, and hes hoping that you realize that he IS a real boy and not a sockpuppets sockpuppet.

Why just a M and nothing else? Good question  its for Importance of using your RealName security and what not. Just know that it sort of rhymes with Â¡muy bien!. If you got here from the Kendo Club Kendo Club page, well cats out of the bag.

If you are a member of the Kendo Club Kendo club and/or Baja SAE Baja SAE, please edit the wiki page(s) as you see fit.

20100309 22:59:28 nbsp Do you shoot guns much?

FYI, an assault rifle is defined as a selective fire weapon with a medium power rifle cartridge. Selective fire means that the gun can be set to either fire once per trigger pull or multiple times per trigger pull. The police often carry AR15s, which are single shot only. One trigger pull, one shot. I doubt you saw anything heavier. Users/WilliamLewis

20100310 17:58:02 nbsp Wow... they let you shoot guns in school still? In San Francisco? Thats awesome! Users/WilliamLewis

20100310 21:51:22 nbsp Was the rifle locked up in the car? The police do, and I think should, have rifles for alot of situations, like how Atticus Finch had to kill the rabid dog in To Kill a Mockingbird. Users/NickSchmalenberger
