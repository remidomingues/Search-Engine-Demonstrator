20100409 18:14:51 nbsp Hey Noah, I just noticed your post on the tour guide page that you left months ago, and just thought Id let you know that they do most of their hiring in the winter (for the mass of spring tours) and during the end of summer (for the mass of fall tours). You can apply any time though, I think, by going to the alumni center. Im sure they just hold your application on file until needed. Also, if you are male, thatd be great because us girl tour guides are sick of there being only a few males. Ha. Good luck, hope that helps. Users/BrookeB
