Harrison Self Storage is a Self Storage temporary storage provider with two locations.

 
   Stuff!  If you got too much and you want to keep it, you need one of the storage units in Davis!



20080922 10:37:56 nbsp I had a horrible time with Harrison self storage. The managers were incredibly rude and condescending toward my husband and I. The employees are kind and polite, but if you need to peak to the managers (who live on site with their yippy dogs) look out!! They charged us $5 for mailing us something (which we never received!), and last I checked postage was 42 cents. They refused to prorate our last month because we did not give 2 weeks notice. Their filing system is archaic as they refuse to use computers for any reason. You have to go drop off your check every month as they have no payment system, just a trick to get you to pay all kinds of fees! We had to pay $75 for our last month, which should have been $40! They refused to give us back our deposit the day we left, and say theyll mail it to us. Ill believe it when I see it. Bottom line, DONT STORE YOUR STUFF HERE!!! Users/colleenj2005

20120820 14:10:12 nbsp Harrison Self Storage Too rocks. The people were always pleasant, the lack of a computer system was not problematic (I even preferred it), its true they had to mail the deposit but as far as I know that is standard procedure with any rental (it arrived in a very timely manor). They even offered my dog a bone while I was packing my stuff to leave. Oh and maybe they did away with their twoweek notice requirement because I had no issues. Overall A+ Users/TreArchy
