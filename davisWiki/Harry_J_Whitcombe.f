The Whitcombe familys history in Davis began in 1934, when Harry J. Whitcombe moved to Davis to begin his career as a Honeybees beekeeper. Harrys wife, Marie, also arrived in Davis in 1934 to attend UCD. When she met Harry, Marie was the gardens editor for Sunset Magazine, one of the first women in the United States to hold such a highprofile editorial position.

Harry, an outspoken person by nature, ranfor and was elected to the Davis City Council in 1954.  He served on the City Council from 4/20/1954 to 4/20/1958.  During World War II, Harry headed a successful program in conjunction with UCD to use active pollination to increase crop yields.  Harry was later appointed to be the Davis Police Department Davis Police Commissioner.

Harry and Marie married in 1935, and soon had three children, John Whitcombe John, Nancy, and Kenny. In 1952, Harry and Marie built their home on Oak Avenue, then the edge of town, and built the first privatelyowned swimming pool in Davis.

The immigrant ancestor of the Whitcomb family was John Whitcomb, who married Frances Coggan, daughter of Henry Coggan of Taunton, Somersetshire, and settled in Lancaster, Massachusetts. Interestingly, the terminal e on the end of the family name seems to be a very recent addition. Harry J. Whitcomes father,  Harry Lee C.
