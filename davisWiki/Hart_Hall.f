George Address(Hart Hall, 38.540483430638, 121.750878927527) (typically just Hart Hall) sits just outside The Quad, next to Wellman Hall.  Youre likely to have any sort of class in Hart, provided its not too huge.  Hart contains the departments of Chicana/o Studies, American Studies, African American and African Studies, Asian American Studies, Women and Gender Studies, Human Development, Community and Regional Development and the Community Development Graduate Group. Hart Hall houses one of two main media labs, the Media Distribution Lab. See also, Meyer Media Lab.
The Carl Gorman Museum, a nationally recognized art gallery focused on innovative and provocative Native American art, is located just off Harts atrium. Exhibits associated with the Museum are on occasionally changing display in glass cases and on the walls of the atrium.

A wonderful thing about Hart, an accentuation of its beautiful exterior design, is its audio/visual lab: containing computers, scanners (including slide/negative scannersFootnote(Make sure you ask for the negative holder for the slide scanner machine if you want to Living Cheaply live cheaply and scan negatives. But this isnt as easy as it sounds. When I tried to scan my negatives, the CRC could not figure out how to work the damn thing.)), and videotaped lectures.

Employees of Campus Safety Escort Service provide security in Hart on weekends and during weeknights, based at their desk in the main entry hall.

Hart Hall, formerly known as the http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt7199r928/?querydavis&brandcalisphere Animal Sciences Building, was built in 1928.  In fact, you can still tell where the building used to read Animal Sciences instead of George Hart Hall.  It was one of the first permanent buildings on campus and is now a nationally registered Historic Places historic place. It was named for George H. Hart, a longtime Animal Science department chair who contributed significantly to the development of scientific emphasis within the department and who later became the first Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine.

Renovation:  The building was renovated 19912 to look like it does today.  Before it took on the somewhat Spanish/Mission style, it looked a lot like the ugly Hunt Hall.  The University, when it puts its mind to it can do some awesome renovations.  Shields Library is another awesome example of this.

Hart Hall became a  http://www.nationalhistoricalregister.com/CA/yolo/state.html designated historical site in 1986.
