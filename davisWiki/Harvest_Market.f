This is an eulogy for Harvest Market.  Harvest Market was a Chineseowned market which had one of best Asian foods sections of any of the Davis markets, and had a very excellent butcher department.  They had an amazing selection of fish and the standard meats, but what made this place better than most is that they sold singleperson portions rather than in those suited primarily for families.  They also had lots of different kinds of hot sauce.  Possibly most beloved by many was the close proximity to the dorms, allowing students to purchase fresh fruits, veggies, and the aforementioned single portion meats.   All of this made this place an amazing store.

But now theyre gone and now Davis dormdweller can have imported coffee beans and Danishes from Cost Plus World Market Cost Plus instead.

Users/JaimeRaba jr: If Davis had to let in a big chain store into the heart of town, why did it have to be one that is going to put all the trinket stores in Davis out of business, instead of one that is actually useful to the student population it is immediately adjacent to?
  The store was originally occupied by a Safeway, so it has been occupied by a chain store in the past. Users/BrentLaabs
  The actual restriction the city removed which resulted in another chain store into Davis had nothing to do with chains.  (In fact, its probably illegal for a city to bar chain stores.)  It had previously been zoned to be occupied only by a grocery store.  I believed this zoning was a good one for students.  Hello, Trader Joes.  However, once Cost Plus expressed interest in this site, the city allowed to have the zoning restriction removed, giving into a bit of lobbying.  This means that students who live near campus without cars cant buy groceries without an involved trip on a bus or a bike.  And so Trader Joes is being courted to take over the lowtraffic uglyorange shopping center that once was Ralphs, and of course, they refuse.  Users/JaimeRaba
