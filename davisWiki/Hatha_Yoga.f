The UC Davis Health Awareness Program, via Staff Development & Professional Services, offers a free weekly yoga class for university employees. To sign up, you have to fill out a waiver form that includes your work phone number, which may be the only way they check if youre legit.

Instruction includes 12 basic asanas (postures), two types of pranayama (breath), relaxation, meditation and information about diet. The instructor, Susan NelsonKluk, has been trained by the Sivananda Yoga Organization. For more information about yoga and the Sivanda organization check out the http://www.sivananda.org Sivananda OM webpage.

New students are encouraged to come on the first Friday of each month. Check the http://sdps.ucdavis.edu/hap/yogasched.htm schedule to see what room its in. (Besides Lower Freeborn, its also sometimes held in Hoagland Hall or the Silo.)
