20100623 14:47:48 nbsp I was going to consign with All Things Right And Relevant but read on their wiki page that sometimes things go missing. Decided to try Haute Again first, where the storekeeper selected about 8 out of 25 items. The dropoff at Haute Again was easy and pleasant.

20101023 13:41:10 nbsp A unique find in downtown Davis that rises above the typical consignment store. The Indie Craft Faire they hold 4 times a year is another bonus to this innovative and special store that holds to quality standards. Users/GarySaylin

20120330 14:22:10 nbsp The shop is really cute, and the selection is of pretty good quality, but every time I visit the sales lady seems really unfriendly. Ive been here as both a consigner and a customer and the experience is so uncomfortable that I wont be returning.  Users/AlexCourtney

20130117 09:14:02 nbsp Nina is incredibly friendly to me every time I stop by this store, even when I bring in my rambunctious children. My teenage daughter also loves Haute Again because of the classy consignment clothes choices that she finds there. Im grateful to have locally owned options for clothing choices in downtown Davis, and I especially appreciate the attention to customer service that one encounters at Haute Again. Users/DrandyJones
