20070718 16:12:49 nbsp Wow, its like an L&L explosion. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070719 21:26:08 nbsp Yay for an Ohana. Would have been nice for an independent place to open, but Ill settle for it. An Ohana setting up shop, however, opens the good possibility that an L & L will appear as well, as the two tend to follow each other around. Somewhere in north Davis, perhaps? Users/KevinChin
