Hay (aka Straw) is a multipurpose material grown locally. It can be used for pet/horse bedding, building material like the Straw Bale Bench, landscaping mulch, bicycle race crash barriers, outdoor seating and all sorts of other stuff.

  Small amounts (for small mammal pets) can be obtained at PetCo.  (Maybe Ace?)
