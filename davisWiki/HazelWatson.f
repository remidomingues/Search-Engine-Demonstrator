I have lived in Davis since the 80s originally moving here as a disgruntled fifth grader with my parents and younger siblings.  I left to go to college elsewhere, something I strongly recommend all Graduates of the Davis Joint Unified School District Davis High graduates do, and came back later to marry and settle down.  I work in Davis, as a support facilitator to a young woman in a wheelchair, and thus notice and advocate for accessibility issues.  I am married to Users/JasonAller but will in no means seek to match his wikignoming abilities and escapades.
