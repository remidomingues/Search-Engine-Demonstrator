  From therapy to pure relaxation, Davis offers a variety of Massage Services


20120317 15:31:36 nbsp I have been going to Karen Khamashta for regular massage therapy since 2008 when my previous massage therapist discontinued her practice.  Karen specializes in trigger point massage which involves painlessly releasing muscle knots that are believed to be a source of pain experienced elsewhere in the body. It took me a while get accustomed to her style as I was used to a no interaction Swedish style relaxation approach, and wasn’t looking specifically for pain relief. However, after ten minutes on the table I now feel the tension begin to melt away. By the end of the massage I am completely relaxed and any incipient pain in my body is gone. Karen’s office is located in a quiet neighborhood in Davis.  She uses a heated pad on the table so I am never cold, even in the middle of winter  something I really appreciate. And her fee  $85 for an hour and a half – is very reasonable. Whether you are looking for relief from chronic pain or just relief from everyday stress, Karen can help you.
