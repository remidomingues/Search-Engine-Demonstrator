 Reiki 
What is Reiki?

rei  the Japanese word for Universal

ki  means Life Force

Reiki is the energy of the Universal Life Force. In other traditions known as prana or chi, this energy is the life force that exists as particles of energy we see as solid form.

How do I receive a Reiki healing?

The client reclines on a massage table fully clothed and allows the practitioner to place hands either above the body or directly on the body aligning with the midline of the body and the chakra centers.

What does the Reiki energy actually do?

Healing energy enters the body and deeply regenerates and relaxes the client. The chakras become rebalanced translating to a harmonizing in the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual centers.

Does the Reiki energy heal physical imbalances?

Because physical misalignments begin first in the auric body, Reiki energy can act to assist in healing on the physical level. By channelling energy into the aura, the chakras rebalance, translating balance into the physical body as well.
