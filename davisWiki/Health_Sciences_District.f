Southwest of Campus proper, there is a magical land which many students might never venture towards, unless they have a sick Dogs dog and are willing to bargain for its health with med students at the vet hospital located there. This place is the Health Sciences District, and it is currently under such heavy construction that the people in charge of such things have put up construction info signs with the express purpose of pointing you at the other nearby construction info signs.


The for more information URL listed on the signs, http://www.libdev2.ucdavis.edu/healthsci/hsdistrict , leads to a lessthanhelpful 404.
