The Loren D. Carlson Health Sciences Library   also known as the Health Sciences Library or simply HSL  is located across La Rue Road off of Hutchison Drive in the Health Sciences Complex.   Parking is available in Lot 54 and is also a stop for the Unitrans H line and the UC Davis Medical Center UCDMC shuttle which makes runs to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.  But if you are coming from the main campus, it is usually just faster to walk.  It takes about 20 minutes to walk from Olson Hall Olson and about 3 minutes to bike from Tercero Residence Halls Tercero.

Located within the HSL are the periodicals for the medical journals and monographs (books).  It is a great place to study since it is full of Grad Students and is really quiet.  On average there are about 5 people studying or making copies in the building at any given time on the weekends.  Most of the resources here arent available in the Shields Library.  The most common complaint, and basically the only, is that their journals are library use only so come with cash for the copy machines.

Also, the first floor is dedicated to Reference and the current periodicals whereas the basement holds the journals and monographs.  All of the journals begin with their call numbers as W1 so 75% of the basement is taken up by journals.  If you cant find what you are looking for and you are using the call number, you probably have overlooked whether it begins with a w1 or not.

Most people dont know this library exists so impress your friends and visit the library!  Or just enjoy a cup of coffee in Scrubs which is located right next HSL.
