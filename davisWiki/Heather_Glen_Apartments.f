20140623 12:14:17 nbsp I have not ever lived here, but was interested in living here in the near future and had an awful experience with one of the office staff (name was not givenstrike one). I called to collect information as I am moving to the area in about six months, and wanted to see what my options were. When I called, the phone was answered promptly, however the employee was not in any way happy to be speaking on the phone with me. Grumbly, exasperated tone of voice was all I heard on the other end of the phone and when I began asking questions, the employee started huffing and puffing asking me why these questions were relevant. Whether they were relevant questions or not, an employee should have immediate access to all information about the complex and be willing to assist the prospective tenant in any way possible. This employee did not have any information to offer me and was only giving a bad attitude. I honestly cant say whether this is a reflection on the rest of the staff, or if someone was just having a bad day. Either way, something to consider! Users/TayMo
