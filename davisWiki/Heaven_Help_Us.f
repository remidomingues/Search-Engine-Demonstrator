Heaven Help Us is an awesome softball team made up mostly of players from Davis Lutheran Church / Crossings Alternative Worship Crossings, and Lutheran Church of the Incarnation.

Heaven Help Us plays in the Tuesday night CoEd city league at Playfields Park.

Due to our overwhelming success last season (we didnt lose all of our games), HHU has signed an endorsement deal with First Northern Bank.  Thank you very much to them!


Although they love to compete against the current teams, they miss playing against the team from Woodstocks Pizza.  Woodstocks always brought music and an announcer to the game.  Very fun!
