20051205 nbsp I went to the Heidrick Center last year on the free museum day.  It was really interesting.  There are really old tractors and trucks, as well I giant machines that are amazing to look at.  Their gift shop also carries http://www.farmgame.com/ The Farming Game which can be hard to find Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20130609 12:51:21 nbsp I went here with my 2 year old son at 10 am on a Sunday morning. He seemed to like the experience, and really liked the old fire trucks. We didnt find the Ertl Playzone or computer interactives, but perhaps we just overlooked them. All of the staff were very friendly. The collection is impressive and well displayed, with descriptions at each piece. I was impressed that all of the pieces, even those over 100 years old, were in great condition. Users/Wehttam
