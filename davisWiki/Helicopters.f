Helicopters can frequently be seen hovering over Davis, especially at Night Time.

A search in the DPD website for the word helicopter yields no results.

Whos helicopters are these?  Are they simply consuming fuel to justify the existence of helicopters in their (whoever they are) budgets?  Or is this a plot even more sinister? Users/RishiTrivedi
Davis can request assistants from Sac (city and county) who have a fleet, its part of interagency cooperation Daubert

Ive seen them practicing approaches and landings (at night) at the UC Davis airport. I suspect that someone may be doing some flight training recently, and has been using the Davis area as part of their training. Im not sure, but I think there is a helicopter training school at one of the Sacramento airports. I know for sure there is one in Concord. Users/EricKlein
