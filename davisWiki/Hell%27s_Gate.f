Hells Gate is a site for urban exploration.  It has nothing to do with hell, unless hell smells like a sewer. Blocked by a gate, and locks, makes for a difficult entrance. With one of the locks broken off already, you can move the top gate off with the use of a crow bar. Once inside, beware of intimidating graffiti. Also watch for quick fill ups of the main pipe by side pipes. Should be safe in the summer though. The entire pipe is nearly a mile and a half and exits near the car dealerships to the west of Interstate 80.

As of midsummer 2009 a new lock has been installed making it impossible to open. Havent been back since then.
