Their repertoire includes a wide range of music genres, from top 40 (Never Ever Getting Back Together by Taylor Swift) to alternative (Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes) to R&B (I’ll Be Waiting by Adele) to classics (Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond). The Spokes’ love for singing can be heard in their latest album, Shades of Pink: Volume 1, which is available on iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, and Loudr. http://www.youtube.com/watch?vLuJouRBtzB8 Here is a video of The Spokes singing their rendition of Us Against the World by Play at HellaCappella 2013!
