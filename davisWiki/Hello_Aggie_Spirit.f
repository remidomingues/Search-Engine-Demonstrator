Hello Aggie Spirit, later Hi Aggie Spirit,  was the name of a Traditions tradition of friendliness at UC Davis.  After World War II, the campus expanded from a small farm to a fullfledged member of the UC System.  Since this change was so rapid  an order of magnitude more students in a decade  many students tried to preserve the small campus feeling of openness and fraternity.

Hello Aggie Spirit was pretty simple in operation.  It simply means saying Hi, Aggie! to fellow students when you see them on campus, thus breaking the ice between any two Aggies.

The idea of Hi Aggie Spirit lasted from the early Davis Timeline 1950s until the mid1960s, when campus became too big and too caught up in the politics of war and social justice to maintain a sense of friendship based solely on community.  Of all of the traditions that UC Davis has lost, this is probably one of the UC Davis Honor Code two most deserving of being brought back.
