The wiki:wikipedia:Helmeted Guineafowl (Numida meleagris) is the best known of the guineafowl bird family, Numididae, and the only member of the genus Numida. It breeds in Africa, mainly south of the Sahara, and has been widely introduced into the West Indies and southern France.

And Davis, the multicultural town that it is, has a flock as well.  They can range extensively, but have been seen around the southwest part of campus.


20080315 19:41:40 nbsp There is a flock of at least 11 large chickenlike birds (but more like goosesized) wandering around campus near the Arboretum. Black and white feathers in sort of a herringbone tweed. Anybody know what they are? I saw the peahen hanging out with them, but I really doubt theyre peafowl.

20080316 01:10:45 nbsp Sounds more like peahens. Peacocks are males with very long trains of feathers. Users/JimEvans

20080316 09:54:07 nbsp Perhaps Guineafowl?  They are chickenlike, spotted, smaller than peafowl.  Users/DavidFeliz

20080318 13:07:59 nbsp Guineafowl! Thank you, David. Yes, after checking out pictures on the Web, the birds Im seeing around are almost certainly Helmeted Guineafowl. I saw twelve of them, with the peahen, yesterday morning. Probably the Enterprise, like me, was confused by the fact that the peahen is hanging out with them. I think flocking birds sometimes flock with other species if they cant flock with their own. Poor peahen.  Users/Prof.Spice

20080408 19:21:07 nbsp I heard a couple professors talking about the Guineafowl and they think that someone just dumped them here after Winter Break. Users/lynzeer89

20080714 16:38:43 nbsp I was wondering what the heck these things were... Users/JoePomidor
