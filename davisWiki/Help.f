This is a special page on the wiki:  accounts that have been disabled due to being Wiki Community/organizational accounts organizational accounts can post here and ask for assistance in opening an account under their name.


The most common problem is being unable to signup using your same email:  You have to change and close the first account yourself by logging in under the old name and clicking settings in the upper right hand corner.  You will then want to change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and press Save. Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under your name.

If you click on the links on the notice it will explain the reasoning behind the organization accounts. The few ruined it for the many. You can add Eastlake to the pet friendly apartments list by clicking edit on the bottom left of the page! Daubert

20120220 13:54:58 nbsp people are now fond of using Anonymous accounts as organizational account end run Users/StevenDaubert
  It still addresses the my account is the only official one problem.  I have far less problem with an anonymous account than a Im in charge here type account.  jw
Truth, however its still a smarmy end run, and that is what I get hung up on.

20120329 14:59:31 nbsp How do I update my prices? Users/ManagerSilverstone
   You are free to edit the page, just like anybody else in the community.  Its only that specific account name that is causing problems (for several reasons).  Go ahead and create a personal account, and feel free to use your first name or however you introduce yourself to members of the public that walk in your office... part of the problem is lack of accountability.  Can you imagine if things were being done around your complex and everybody was sharing the same name Employee?  Who left the office unlocked? Oh, that was employee. Which one? Just employee.  Youd never have a clear idea who was doing what.  Thats just one of the several issues with organizational names.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20130131 08:50:57 nbsp I cannot see my account! Why my account has been remove? Users/Nastranskincare
    Your account was not created with an actual persons name. Due to spam and abuse issues, organizational accounts are not allowed. You can fix this by creating a new account.  You have to change and close the first account yourself by logging in under the old name and clicking settings in the upper right hand corner. You will then want to change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and press Save. Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under your name.  Hope this helps.  Users/PeteB
