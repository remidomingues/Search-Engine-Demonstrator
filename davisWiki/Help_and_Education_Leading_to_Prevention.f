Mission Statement
   H.E.L.P. stands for Help and Education Leading to the Prevention...of Poverty.  We are a student run, nonreligious affiliated, community service club centered here at the University of California, Davis.  As a member of H.E.L.P. students encounter a variety of community service opportunities through activities such as:

Chow Nights  our weekly program where meals are served to the homeless and low income families restaurant style.

César Chávez  a weekly program similar to Chow Nights where meals are served at César Chávez Plaza

Progress Ranch  a program that is located at a local group home where we tutor and mentor disadvantaged children.

C.E.A.P.  promoting awareness of poverty while teaching leadership skills to our youth in local Davis schools.

Annual Programs  these include our big Thanksgiving Dinner and Empathy not Apathy.

Goals and aspirations of HELP
     We wish to promote awareness of the problem of poverty as a societal problem and only through participation and dedication of the community will this problem be solved.  As an antipoverty and prosocial advancement organization, we want to diversify ourselves in our activities which would ultimately help us accomplish our goal.  We do not discriminate on the bases of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or disabilities.

So what are you waiting for?!?! Come and educate yourself about the issues, meet great folks fighting for this cause, see how connected you are to the problems of poverty, and find out how you can help, locally and globally. Experience the organization, preparation, delivery, and rewards of service in the local community. Come to the next HELP general meeting and learn about the many programs HELP organizes, including helping the homeless and underserved as well as underprivileged children, and how you can contribute.

We need YOU to help us make a difference!
