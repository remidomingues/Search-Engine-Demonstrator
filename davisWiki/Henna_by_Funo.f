   Confirmed.  Black Henna is potentially dangerous, and actually illegal.  More information available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna#Black_henna Black Henna on Wikipedia.

20071203 08:34:52 nbsp Just as general advocate of personal choice, Ill point out that the same applies to many other things.  Black henna can also cause nifty patterns with no reaction whatsoever (thus how popular it is).  Unlike peanuts and bees, it is illegal.  Like other marijuana illegal substances, it has people who use it despite the law.  I wouldnt do it, but then, I dont think my personal choices should dictate everybodys choices. Users/JabberWokky
