20070720 17:59:56 nbsp Fair use requires that we consider the following four things under 17 USC 107:
 1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
 1. the nature of the copyrighted work;
 1. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
 1. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

There is a possible fair use case under 1, as it is reproduced for nonprofit educational purposes. However, you are reproducing the work in whole, which is troublesome under 3. Also, the ease of reproduction could impact the market for sold copies of the agreement, which is troublesome under 4. While I dont think well get sued or anything, I think itd be better to play it safe and not reproduce the work in whole unless we get permission. If we were sued, Im fairly certain wed lose. I think a summary of the terms of the lease along with an analysis would be more valuable to the community, anyway. Im working on both as of now. I believe that its best that the wiki create new content rather than just rip off old content.

20101217 09:49:28 nbsp Hello! Im not really sure that the Costco page was so cluttered as to require splitting up the locations. It seems like putting them in different locations on the page, with see below and the like, will make the page more confusing and harder to read. Cluttered, in a word. Would you object strenuously to me putting it back the way it was? Users/JoePomidor

20101217 13:56:09 nbsp Ah, yeah, but the point is just to be informative. It would be unnecessary if it was unwieldy or completely irrelevant (like listing the costcos in Montana), but I felt that the original version of the page read easier, and had a good flow to it. Users/JoePomidor

20110130 15:06:11 nbsp Hi Henry, its nice to see you added the menu to the Monticello page. I had a nice lunch there with my extended family a few weeks ago. I had the pork sandwich, which was very tasty. I miss seeing you, and I hope you are well. I live with Ryan again in the bay area, maybe you could come visit some time if you are in the bay area. <3 Users/NickSchmalenberger
