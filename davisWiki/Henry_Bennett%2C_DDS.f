20071231 12:11:21 nbsp My son had a very good experience with Dr. Bennett and his staff during and after his wisdom teeth extractions. A relatively wholistic approach to care, including a postsurgical regimen of vitamin/mineral supplementation. Users/nls

20090619 12:02:51 nbsp I got my wisdom teeth pulled yesterday. I dont think I could have asked for a better doctor to preform the surgery. He set me up with a very natural post surgical regimen that involves enzyme lotion, special mouthwash, and a variety of vitamins and minerals to speed the healing process. His staff is very nice and knows you by name. Since my mom brought me home after the surgery and I live a few hours away, he set up for a doctor in the area in case there were any complications and called me last night to make sure everything was going smoothly and to see if I had any questions and concerns. Very nice doctor, very knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a dental surgeon.  Users/AppleBlossom

20090810 08:21:56 nbsp I dont know how the doctor is, because I havent had my surgery, but both receptionists I spoke to at this office were surprisingly rude and condescending to me every time I called, from the initial contact onwards.  One even hung up on me when I was trying to discuss payment options.  Very unprofessional and the last thing a patient wants to deal with on top of serious pain. Users/egs1981

20090810 09:17:29 nbsp Based on what appeared to be a culture of disrespect for patients at this office, I called to cancel my appointment and was hung up on a second time.  Dr. Bennett may be a great doctor but I really dont recommend dealing with his staff. Users/egs1981

20100812 20:40:54 nbsp I too am not particularly impressed with the staff on the phone. The woman I spoke with is neither polite nor accurate.  Users/trutybetold

20100911 13:46:41 nbsp I cant believe anybody would say that the front office staff is rude at Dr. Bennetts! I had an amazing experience there. I am one of those people who are intensely scared of the dentist and any dental procedure. I went to Dr. Bennett so that I could be sedated and have my widsom teeth and one badly damaged tooth extracted. He spent the consultation time really getting to know me and make me feel incredibly comfortable. As for the front desk staff they knew I was nervous and got me water, asked me about my recent marraige and my job. I couldnt have asked for a better experience and would highly reccommend this office for anyone needing oral surgery. I also had a great conversation with the Dr. about history, overall health and wellness and natural ways to heal. He is my favorite kind of dr!  Users/LFHR

20100911 21:09:10 nbsp I have recommended Dr. Bennett to others looking for oral surgery, based on my excellent experience over a decade ago. I had a growth removed, had it become infected on a Sunday afternoon, and called the number Dr. Bennett had given me. He quickly called me back and arranged for antibiotics to be available (there were no Davis pharmacies open at that time on a Sunday). I felt that the procedure went well  mouths just can get infected. Caring, integrative in his approach, and very knowledgeable: a professional I can recommend. I certainly had no problems with his office staff, but you would guess theyve changed since my experience :^) Users/DougWalter

20110524 12:08:24 nbsp I would absolutely recommend him!  He is kind, and will provide sedation so that YOU FEEL NO PAIN.  This is the absolute truth.  I have had an unfortunate dental history and have had to see Dr. Bennett many times (sadly)  since 1978 (!!!!)  Horrifying procedures...NO PAIN.  And he will give you lots of information about holistic approaches to your issues if they are relevant.  He is as bright as a new penny and charming too.  I have not had any problem with the office staff.   Users/FredaBrown

20110913 11:24:27 nbsp I just called their office to get information about wisdom teeth, and the staff person spent ten minutes talking me through both the procedure and my payment options.  She was extremely clear, patient and helpful. Users/mcenzer
