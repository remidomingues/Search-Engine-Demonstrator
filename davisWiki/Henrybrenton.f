20071226 19:45:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I restored Alder Ridge Apartments because we try not to delete content around here. If the information on that page needs to be corrected please do so. If you have any questions please ask. Users/JasonAller

20071226 20:10:44 nbsp Dont you think that if the owner wants to remove this site they should be able to without you coming and restoring it?  Users/Henrybrenton
   The content of the wiki is owned by the community as a whole, not the subject of the entry.  think of it as a newspaper article  a review of a restaurant in the Enterprise is not owned by the restaurant.  Unlike a newspaper article, the business can (and is encouraged to) edit the entry.  Read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the wiki introduction for business owners for more information.  The wiki is for and by the community as a whole, which means both businesses and individuals.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20071226 20:16:33 nbsp Have you read Welcome to the Wiki and Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner? Users/JasonAller

20071226 20:42:53 nbsp Yes I can say that I have just finished reading both Welcome to the Wiki and Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner!  I do understand the difference of Owner ship and Owned by the Community.  It has changed my mind on how I think about this Site Users/Henrybrenton
  Just keep in mind that it is an effort by the community to document itself: the profile of the Mayor is written by a group of people...just like it would be by the Enterprise... but unlike in a newspaper article the records are open: there is no such thing as a staff article or staff review.  Each individual editor is tracked, and as a result, each individual line can be accounted for.  As a result, the process is more open and auditable (click the Info icon on any entry, and you can see the entire history of exactly who wrote what).  In addition, businesses have the ability to respond directly, as opposed to a newspaper review.  If the Sac News and Review gives your business a negative review, you have no real recourse.  Here on the wiki, you can address a negative review and answer the individual directly and publically.  It is sometimes a bit alarming to realize that there are people saying negative things about your business, but the people who are saying those things are already complaining to their friends and peers, often on various websites and their private internet blogs.  The wiki gives you an equal and open forum to address their complaints... and most businesses find that their happy tenants and customers step up to defend them as well (note that after that negative review on Alder Ridge about mice, two people sprung up to defend the apartments!).  Fundamentally, when it comes to content on the wiki, everybody in the community is equal.  That means that the tenants/customer/clients have a say, but unlike a newspaper article or traditional website, so does the business owner.  The entire community has an opportunity to have input equally, including you.  The community as a whole can do some fantastic work: take a look at the entry on Dogs or how the Varsity Theater uses the wiki.  More in your field, see how Tandem Properties uses the wiki and how events like their Tandemonium are part of the wiki.  In general, if it is part of Davis, eventually somebody adds it to the wiki.  You (as part of the Davis community) are more than to encouraged to contribute.  Most editors will also work to help you as much as we can: we all want to make sure the wiki is as factually correct and up to date as possible. If you have any specific questions about anything, always feel free to ask.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
