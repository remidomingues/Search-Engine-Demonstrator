There is a need for unity of our people on campus and in the community. A club can limit one to a certain environment, but a fellowship, among brothers, can broaden that limit to include a campus, a community and a culture. The time has come to open new doors for our people because our young brothers throughout this country need us as role models to help guide them into obtaining better lives for themselves.

Many brotherhoods in college do not have an organizational name that represents their philosophies. We, the Chicano/Latinos of Davis, have united on this day, May twentyfirst 1989 nineteen hundred eightynine, to create a fellowship that represents our beliefs. The chosen name for this organization is HERMANOS MACEHUAL (the brotherhood of the â€œcommon people). The term MACEHUAL identifies with the common Indians of Central and South America. As part of the Aztec dynasty, the Macehualmeh (the common Indian) would do all the necessary manual labor in the community. The land was worked communally because the Indians helped each other in all their labors and they joined together ingroups of twenty and did not leave until everyones own was done. As our ancestors once did, we the Hermanos Macehual of Davis will continue to provide service to our community and educational outreach in an effort to unify our people and bring about better lives for everyone.

Not only did we help underrepresented communities around Davis, we also had a good time socializing with each other and other orgs within the Latino/Chicano community. Meetings are biweekly in Wellman. I love it Users/Efren
