20121003 10:54:38 nbsp I just had a bad experience with these guys. I needed to drive to Santa Barbara, and reserved a compact rental car one day ahead of time, and selected the pick me up at home option on the Hertz web form for 2pm the next day. Nobody came to pick me up, so I called, and nobody picked up the phone for 30 minutes (I had to call several times in a row because the phone carrier kept disconnecting me after ringing for several minutes). Finally I got a guy named Keith who said there wasnt a car for me right now, and hed call me back once he had one. He didnt, so I called him back shortly before 4pm, which only took five minutes or so for Keith to pick up again. Now he said that because I missed my 2pm rental pickup window, they wouldnt have a car for me at all. So I went to Avis instead, and got a lastminute car there. Users/OliverKreylos

20121016 09:59:36 nbsp HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO NOT GO! Seriously they are nice people but this local Hertz is not well organized and when they make a mistake they cant fix it. When they say theyll call you back they dont and when you call them back they dont remember you and they say the same thing Whats your name and number well call you back as soon as possible. Never happens. They mischarged myself and my insurance company and never fixed it. I have called them through out the past 3 months asking constantly for them to fix it. The people that pick up just say Myself or our manager will call you back. Never going back again. They need to fix their system and structure because it is terrible.  Users/PeerReview

20121227 15:28:47 nbsp I rented from them about three weeks ago and had a perfectly fine experience. The car I got was brand new  68 miles on it and a new car smell. Pickup wasnt the fastest, but it wasnt the slowest. Drop off was the same. Young guy behind the counter mumbled a lot, but other than that I have no complaints. As an under 25 driver, that UCD discount is a lifesaver. I would absolutely rent from them again, though from the above comments and my own vibes Id probably shy away from the home pickup option.

20140311 20:38:58 nbsp I set up a reservation here, but when I showed up, they didnt have any cars available, so they said I would have to call the 1800 number to cancel my reservation. One month later, my card still hadnt received the refund. There really isnt any good reason to go here. My personal experience aside, the location just seemed a bit dingy and poorly managed, not to mention in a pretty odd location. The staff were nice, but not particularly accommodating or helpful.

20140523 19:04:30 nbsp TL;DR:   Do not use Davis Hertz.

Yes, the employees are nice, but this is hell on Earth.

I ordered a pickup and arrive to find 7 people in line and 4 employees working. Unfortunately, only 2 employees were actually helping customers. I waited in line for an hour and 45 minutes to be helped, which means it took each employee over 30 minutes to help each customer. 30 minutes. Three. Zero. 30 minutes to collect drivers license information, pull up rental information, swipe a credit card, and walk once around a car.

I felt good about having a reservation, but I was obviously a bit too hopeful. A reservation doesnt mean that I actually have a car reserved. No, it actually meant that I had the choice of 1) taking a different car with expired tags, 2) waiting for an employee to make a roundtrip to Sacramento during rush hour, or 3) paying $20 to upgrade to the next level. But the good news is that the car with expired tags is a step up from what I reserved, right? Oh, and at least if I get pulled over Ill just need to explain to the officer that its a rental. Thank goodness.

When I pointed out that I had been waiting for an hour and 45 minutes and it might be nice to give me the free upgrade so that I could drive a car legally, I was rebuked. I was literally told that lots of people had to wait hours to get their cars today. Chew on that for a moment. My poor customer service is okay because everyone else gets poor customer service too. Do you really want to support a business that thinks that way?

Ive rented a car from Avis twice over the last month. Both times, I arrived, was served within 5 minutes, and left after 5 minutes at the counter. I decided to go with Hertz for a weekend rental because Avis was more expensive (theyre the same price during the week). Im never making this mistake again, regardless of cost.

To anyone from Hertz that might read this:  join the 21st century. You shouldnt need to type in information on your own vehicles every time one is checked out. You shouldnt need to type in customer information if that information is already associated with the reservation. Hell, you shouldnt even need confirmation numbers for reservations. For example, Avis prints out a sheet every day and leaves it next to the register. It has all of the customer information and all they need to do is highlight your name and look you up when you walk in.

Have some pride in your work. Users/Unacceptable

20140614 18:31:50 nbsp WORST PLACE EVER!!! Consider yourself warned! THE ABSOLUTE WORST!! I reserved a car 6/11/14 for 11:00 am. I called the location at 10AM to confirm I could be picked up. Per their website “Special Services at this Location Pickup/Return Service: Available with a one hour advance notice and within 15 minutes from the Hertz Local Edition location. Once your reservation is booked, the location will call or email you at the phone number or email address provided to confirm pick up service.”

I spoke to “David” at 10AM and was told the driver would be at my place within the hour of my reservation.
Around 12:30 I received a call from David stating the driver was in Woodland and should be arriving any minute. They NEVER showed up, nor did they call.
At 2PM I called a taxi (12$), upon arrival to the location there were about 8 people waiting. I patiently waited in line (without being acknowledged) where I witnessed David argue with his coworker. SOOOO unprofessional….

Around 230 I was told there were no cars on the lot and that the 8 people already there would get the next car that came in even though I had a reservation.  I asked lady at the desk what was the point in making a Reservation if it would not be honored. She replied “well you still need to check in and wait because we are really busy”.  I was not able to rent a car this day which resulted in my missing my nieces graduation as well as missing a full day of work. Had I been told they were sold out when I spoke to David (the poor excuse of a manager) at 10 AM this could have all been prevented.  Overall, I received horrible customer service here and I will not be returning (ID MUCH RATHER WALK 100 miles before I come back here). I have never experienced this type of service at any car place and this was my very first time coming here.

Consider yourself warned!
