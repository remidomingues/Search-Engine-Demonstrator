Hiba Saeed is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2013 ASUCD Election running on the SMART slate.


 Candidate Statement 
Hey Aggies!

My name is Hiba Saeed and I am running to be one of your new ASUCD senators. I am a second year International Relations major, originally from the San Francisco Bay Area. I serve as the Events Coordinator, the head of the Political Action Committee for the Muslim Student Association, and as a commissioner on the ASUCD Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission. I have interned for Senator Liam Burke. I am a part of Phi Alpha Delta, the coed PreLaw Fraternity on campus. Often, I can be found at the ARC Starbucks making drinks! With my experience with ASUCD and other positions, I promise to work tirelessly to bring access to resources and equity to all students on our campus. I have worked closely with student leaders on campus to bring light to issues concerning many communities and I hope to continue to do this on the Senate table. I will make UC Davis a better place for ALL students by:

Accommodations for Religious Observances

Many students on campus do not get the opportunity to observe their religious and cultural holidays because of classes, midterms, and finals. I will work to get the university to formally recognize prevalent holidays on our campus. Professors should be urged to make accommodations for students observing the recognized holidays. This allows students to celebrate their respective holidays without compromising their spiritual and cultural beliefs.

Bring Back the ASUCD Campus Safety

Every student should feel safe on campus. I will tackle many of the campus safety issues students are dealing with every single day. In order to do this, I will reestablish the ASUCD Campus Safety unit. ASUCD Campus Safety will bring together the concerns of the UC Davis community through uniting the various committees, units, and clubs already working on separate issues that fall under campus safety concerns. The Campus Safety committee will put on workshops, programs, and events to accomplish a better atmosphere for everyone. This unit would work closely with campus and community entities (including the UCD Police Department, Sexual Assault Awareness and Advocacy Committee, Greek Organizations, campus clubs, and the DREAM Committee) to ensure that students study in a safe environment.
