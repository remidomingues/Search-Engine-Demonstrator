Panda Express expanded into the space formerly occupied by HibachiSan.

HibachiSan was the Green Burrito to Panda Express Carls Jr. Or to put it another way, they shared the same location and the same owners, but offered different menus. Whereas Panda Express is Americanized Chinese food, HibachiSan was Americanized Japanese food.  One could choose chicken, beef, shrimp, or a combination of any two.  Items came with fried or steamed rice, and some fried vegetable shreds.  A la carte options included miso, yakisoba, and dumplings.  A handful of readymade maki (CA roll, rainbow roll) were found in a refrigerated case by the register.  This restaurant had less than onethird of the web menu items.

Like most fast food places, one should have been wary of the food quality and (obviously) authenticity. The meats were fried as little pieces on a flattop grill, and the teriyaki sauce was thick and salty. The miso soup had also likely been sitting out for quite a while, and it was quite thick (not brothy) and extremely salty.   Some also complained about the freshness and taste of the ready made rolls.
