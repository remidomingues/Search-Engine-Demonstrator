Hibachi Grill and Take Out was a Japanese and Korean Restaurants restaurant which featured teriyaki, spicy pork, and bulgogi. They also served Korean BBQ. Do not confuse them with HibachiSan.



20050706 07:05:40 This place offers simple, tasty rice bowls, Chinese chicken salad and even smoothies. They have sushi, but it can be a little funky. Id avoid it, and go for the good old chicken teriyaki bowl.  Users/SiennaGrass

20060319 18:08:47 nbsp The owner is one of the nicest owners Ive ever met.  He makes friends with all his clients.  I highly reccommend the spicy pork.  Spicy Pork bowls, while not on the menu, are also available if you ask for it.  Their shakes are also superb. Users/KevinRollins

20060516 09:00:51 nbsp The only thing Ive ever tried on the menu is the Chicken Tariyaki rice bowl, but its always been great.   I never liked teriyaki very much until I tried Hibachis.  Lately, Ive been going here for lunch several times a month. Users/AdamSchneider

20060710 14:36:30 nbsp This place is a little gem.  So far, the restaurant is immaculately clean and the food ingredients seem fresh, and the dishes are tasty. (Ive had the chicken teriyaki and the hibap).  I concur with previous comments: the owner IS very nice.  According to him, the place has been open since about January 2006.  Check it out.

20060712 23:29:54 nbsp The owner is very, very nice.  The food is good.  Perhaps the bowls are a bit small.  I had the BBQ dinner tonight and it was quite good. Users/MisterProfessor

20061018 16:12:04 nbsp For the amount that you pay, you dont get a lot food. I paid $4.60 plus tax for a dinky chicken salad, and it was mostly lettuce and sauce; barely any chicken in it. Users/MattLow

20070210 17:31:00 nbsp This place has been closed for a week or more.  Is it going to open again?  I hope the owners are okay. Users/MisterProfessor

20070211 12:57:03 nbsp I tried the chicken teriyaki here for the first time about a month ago  it was pretty good.  Id return if I was in the area and was craving some teriyaki. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070228 13:06:52 nbsp I think that this place is closed. Everything was taken down when i tired to eat here on feb. 28th Users/DonGibson

20070818 08:09:14 nbsp do you know what is opening up in it now.  there has been a lot of construction. Users/MattHh

20070909 13:26:32 nbsp It looks like its being replaced by Burgers and Brew owned and operated by Crepeville (or so the sign on the front says). Wonder how this will compete with the new 3rd & U Cafe seems like the same kinda food is going to be offered at both locations. Users/ArmyDecoy
