Hibbert Lumber Co. is a familyowned business offering a selection of lumber and hardware for both contractors and doityourselfers. The staff is both knowledgeable and helpful. The business has been around since 1947, established by Jack and Carol Hibbert. It originally existed in the form of a small metal shed and barn located at Third Street and I Street. This first incarnation of the business burned down in 1955. This prompted a move to its current location, where the lumber barn was destroyed by a fire in 1979, this time set by an arson arsonist.

They also own a the The Door Shop Door Shop which is located across the railroad tracks from the main location.


In the 19th century, this site was the location of one of two very large scales that weighed wagons bearing grain.  After the weighing process, the product was then shipped out via the nearby railroad.  The other scale was in the location of where The Secretariat now stands.


20051016 22:28:34 nbsp I have been continually astonished by how crappy Hibberts lumber is.  Their wood is splintered, warped, overpriced, falsely marketed.  the staff inside the store is very helpful though. Users/JosephAaronElijahStewart

20051211 02:30:29 nbsp The wood is stored outside, so you have to let it acclimate to your workshop.  Hibberts and Ace are the only hardware stores that I know of in Davis.  Hibbert has a much wider selection of hardwoods and you can pick out your own pieces. Users/OwenScharlotte

20061205 19:51:29 nbsp These guys are way more helpful than those over at Ace. Highly recommended. Users/WilliamLewis

20070324 07:21:39 nbsp Hibbert is a great place to buy building supplies and lumber. I’ve been buying from them for eight years – small projects to a complete house remodel. The staff is very knowledgeable and has great recommendations for solving problems. Their lumber is excellent quality compared to the big box stores. Returns are easy. Also, they offer free delivery in town  a real plus if you dont have a truck. Generally, their prices are about 510% more than the big box stores, but it is worth it for the excellent service, better quality lumber, and shorter drive. Users/MkLindq

20081123 08:36:21 nbsp Corrugated roofing material at Hibbert lumber is the same price as it is in Home Depot.  This nugget wont be relevant if you want to buy some on a Sunday though. Users/RobiPochapin

20090517 20:48:10 nbsp I am a big fan of the hardware store here. The selection isnt the biggest, but they always have what youre looking for. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. After having just a few too many negative experiences at Ace, I would rather put a Sunday project on hold because Hibberts is closed than head over to an alternative store. Prices may be slightly higher, but youll save with staff insight and reliable products in the end. Users/MichaelAWoods

20091103 21:20:28 nbsp This is how lumber yards and hardware shops used to be: The place to find people who know the building trades. When I ask for a powertool part, it can be ordered in minutes. Something that cant be done at Ace or Home Depot. When I ask for options for lumber, I get proper answers. Hibberts has treated me well, and their prices typically are not higher than anywhere else for the same quality product. Users/DarellDickey

20100223 23:52:25 nbsp Davis is extremely fortunate to have two excellent hardware stores.  Hibbert Lumber has always had both the items Ive needed and people at the front counter who can take me right to them.  On my last trip I purchased four cap nuts.  It was great to buy only the four I needed (and not two pastic bubble packs of 3 each).  It was also nice to be able to hold the various sizes to my part so that I knew I was buying the right size.

20100718 13:02:04 nbsp Hibberts is always on point and super friendly! A charming shop, we got a 4x8 3/4{{{}}} ACX ply sheet and some 4x4s for a little frame work bed install for the back of truck and everyone was friendly and awesome. You cant go wrong if your a contractor headed to hibberts, but if your the little guy who is clueless they are a solid bet. Stay local! Users/StevenDaubert

20110715 21:01:06 nbsp An excellent family business that really cares about its customers and its community.  They are always friendly and ready to help.  The guys in the yard are extremely helpful.  I have had several projects that couldnt have gotten finished without them.  Great way to support the local economy. Users/SilvaJ

20120721 13:56:46 nbsp I went to Ace around this time last summer asking them how to remove a caster that I had in my Ikea desk (I had to completely take the desk apart in order to get it out of my apartment). The dude at Ace told me I needed to buy a power drillwhich I thought was a load of crap. Then I went to Hibbert, showed them a picture of the caster in my desk (like I did at Ace), and the owner physically finds me a caster and shows me how to remove it with a screwdriver. It was so easy to remove and saved my sanity. So definitely not going to Ace anymore for help with stuff like that.  Users/smcosta
