I would actually have to disagree with all these negative comments about Hibiscus Gardening. Hibiscus Gardening has been in business for over 30+ years and the owner Bobby is an excellent hard worker that delivers the best quality work in Davis. I highly recommend Hibiscus Gardening to everyone that needs yard work,hauling,trimming,clean ups, etc.done to call Bobby. Users/Scotthansen

20130106 20:09:34 nbsp This will be a short basic review. Hibiscus Gardening is AMAZING. I never had any problems and they always treated my yard like their very own. May I also include that he actually has a business license unlike the other 90% of the gardeners in Davis or even the other gardeners that come from out of town! Thank you Hibiscus Gardening!

20130402 17:15:34 nbsp Our rent includes weekly lawn service. They didnt show up for a full month last summer (makes it hard to host BBQs when you dont own a mower to pick up their slack) and we had to complain to the landlord before they did the actual work. Despite the lapse in service, rent was not discounted. Unsure if this is because they still charged the property manager or maybe the property manager pocketed the refund. They also broke one of our lawn games a few months ago by throwing it to the side instead of moving it gently  so nice of them. Users/MeggoWaffle
