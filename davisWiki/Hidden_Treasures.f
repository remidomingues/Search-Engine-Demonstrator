Hidden Treasures is a small Thrift Stores thrift store that feels like an antique store.

From the proprietor
Hidden Treasures is unique because it is so unlike your typical thrift store.
Instead of rummaging through piles of old, well worn castaways in a dim musty hole in the wall, your senses will be delighted by nearly new top shelf clothes, furniture, appliances, toys and more at Hidden Treasures.
Windows on all sides let natural light help you spot the perfect thing youre looking for.  New treasures flow through our doors on a daily basis and our low prices ensure you will find that bargain youre looking for.
Cant find it? Just ask, cause you never know at Hidden Treasures.

Hidden Treasures has a surprisingly large variety of baby and childrens clothing  it appears to be mostly baby and toddler.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle thinks it is the largest used clothing selection for kids in Davis next to All Things Right And Relevant R&R.  They had some adult clothing as well, but not nearly as much.  There is also a pretty big selection of baby and childrens accessories such as toys, high chairs, booster seats, etc.

20061126 22:04:35 nbsp Two days before Thanksgiving I was going to pick up a friend in Slatters court, but, found that large city trucks, piles of tree trimmings, and falling branches from above blocked the only entrance to the court. not being able to park where I would have normally done so, I parked in the customer only parking spot in front of the Hidden Treasure Thrift store so that I could run in and grab my friend that I was picking up. Since the store was closed, I figured my parking there for 15 minutes or so would not be a problem. Unfortunately, the owners of the store must have felt differently because when I returned 15 minutes later, my car was gone and I was informed that it had been towed since the store opened a few minutes before. I went to the towing company to liberate my car from the tow yard, and was told I had to pay $220 for my car to be released. Only hours before, I had bailed out of jail (where I was placed for a crime I didnt commit) for an outrageous $2,500, I had no money and every day it stays there is $40 more to the bill. Consequently I missed Thanksgiving with my family and spent it alone with nothing to eat because I had no transportation or funds. My car is still in there until I can save up enough money, and the cost increases daily. I just want to know why my car was towed after only a few minutes? Maybe I was going to shop there, but, ran down the steet since the store was closed, then I would not have been towed? I think it was a spiteful act of the type of people I would never give my business to nor would I recommend to anyone else.  Users/LauraMaria

20080411 09:27:23 nbsp I spend my weekends hunting for treasures hidden away in thrift shops all over California. Hidden Treasures in Davis, California has to be one of the best independent thrift store that I have ever visited. My wife and I were amazed at what we found in that small store. If youve never been, MAKE IT A POINT! AND, if its not on the shelf, ask Renee, the owner, and more than likely shell have what youre looking for hidden away.
P.S. If you just spent 2,500 bucks to bail out of jail right before a major holiday, dont be stupid enough to park where youre not suppose to.  Users/StevenDay

20091103 06:31:22 nbsp Each time I go it is always closed during the time they are supposed to be open. But I would like to see what is inside.  It seemed to look cluttered and cramped with a lot of childrens stuff in it. I hope I am able to walk around. Users/jackieshowel
