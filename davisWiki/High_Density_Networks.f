High Density Networks (HDN) is a High Speed Wireless Internet provider that is offered at various housing communities in the Davis area.  It also supplies DIRECTV Packages starting at $29.99.

They charge $24.95/month for wifi access in your housing complex.
Speeds are claimed as being up to 1.5 Mbps.

The service is plagued by outages, lack of connectivity, stability issues, and faulty/antiquated equipment.

What they dont tell you is that your money actually goes to your apartment complex,  as the complex pays them a flat fee for the service.  So they really dont care how many people use it or the level of customer satisfaction.
Calling customer service is generally met with a voicemail recording which seemingly is never checked, and their response rates are only slightly better via email.  Should you ever reach a live person, they refuse to accept that the problem lies in their network, and at best will promise to send a technician out sometime.  Dont expect any promptness, nor improvement.
