A Laundry & Drycleaning laundromat popular for its nifty retro style.  This is the most indie laundromat within 15 miles of Davis, California.  Washes are $1.25 for a standard machine.  They also have two larger commercial, frontload machines in the back, currently $2.50 per wash.  Good for if you need to wash a rug or large comforter or some such thing.

They also have a Davis city map on the wall, which is convenient if youre out and about and need directions.

If Im correct, this is the same place that doesnt have a change machine; people come to The CoOp all the time to get change, so come prepared.

Cmon Vickie, dont be such a spoilsport. You write that era with the smug leer of a devloper with her eye
