Highway 128 is a navigating davis highway that is theoretically in Davis, but doesnt actually connect.  128 goes from the Pacific Ocean, through Calistoga and the wine country, past Lake Berryessa, and eventually ends up in Winters.  If you keep going straight, the road eventually splits into Russell Boulevard and Covell Boulevard.

State law specifies that 128 extends to Davis and ends at Highway 113. (http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/California_Streets_and_Highways_Code%2C_Chapter_2%2C_Article_3%2C_Section_301635#Route_ source)  Google Earth maps this along Russell, but in reality there are no highway signs past Winters.
