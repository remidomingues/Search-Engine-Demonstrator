Highway 40, or Old Highway 40 is a historic highway that traces a route that comprises several current streets in Davis.  When it was active, its route through Davis was identical to that of the Lincoln Highway, and in fact incorporated a good deal of the Lincoln highway.  East of Park City, Utah, it still exists in modern form as U.S. Route 40. West of there, it has been superseded by Interstate 80.
