Also known as Route 50 or US 50, Highway 50 ran the proverbial coast to coast.  It has sometimes been called The Loneliest Road in America (for the Nevada portion) and Americas Backbone.

Highway 50 is a US highway, a designation that predates the interstate system by many years.  It formerly began in either San Francisco or Oakland, and came through Davis.  Subsequently, the area west of West Sacramento was chopped off as redundant with I80, I580 and other roads.  Now, the beginning is at the Interstate 80 I80 / Business 80 split in West Sacramento.  It shares a designation for 5 miles with Bus80, and then splits off to Carson City, Nevada and through the Davis Midwest Connection Midwest and all the way to Ocean City, MD.  Route 50 goes through the following states:

  Nevada
  Utah
  Colorado
  Kansas
  Missouri
  Illinois
  Indiana
  Ohio
  West Virginia
  Virginia
  Washington D.C.
  and finally Maryland

On the Davis Wikis Interstate 80 I80 page, you can see a sign showing the distance to Ocean City, MD.  On http://www.route50.com route50.com, you can see the sign at the other end of Highway 50, showing the distance back to Sacramento, CA.
