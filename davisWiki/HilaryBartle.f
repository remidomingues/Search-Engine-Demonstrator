Describe HilaryBartle here.

Once upon a time (back in 1972 1974) Hilary Bartle was an undergrad at UC Davis.  Shed been to visit a friend who was enrolled there a few times (and encountered an early version of the Whole Earth Festival WEF in 1970) so when things got too crazy in Berkeley where she was, she transferred up to Davis.  Being insatiably curious, this elefants child got involved in the WEF in 1973 as part of the Karma Patrol.  Originally we were a First Aid and Lost Children sort of thing, but that rapidly expanded to aiding trippers, picking up glass shards on the Quad, talking down altercations and helping the Diggers serve free food to festivalgoers.  We also slept on the stage at night to help prevent theft of gear.  I helped to create the first Tshirts and rainbow banners (still an Art Dept offtime project in those days).  Ive been back most years since, my kids grew up at the WEF and its a fine way for me to spend Grandmothers Day these days.
