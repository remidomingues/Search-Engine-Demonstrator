Since 1965, Hillel at Davis and Sacramento has been helping local students and young adults explore and celebrate their Judaism Jewish identities.  While Hillel focuses on Jewish programming, people of all backgrounds are always welcome.  It works in collaboration with the many student groups on campus, and provides social, religious, and educational programming.

Some of the programs they provide are weekly Shabbat dinners, Jewish holiday services, student groups, free trips to Israel, community service projects, and grad and young professional events.  A common theme of Hillel is that we have good food and good people. As such, there is an open fridge policy, so dont be shy about taking snacks. A free lunch is cooked by Laura Cypress and crew and served every Tuesday at noon. For Sacramento, they offer programs in the area, including for CSUS and other area colleges.

Most events happen at the new Sam Len Hillel House in downtown Davis, located right across the street from Toomey Field. Be warned!  Parking is scarce, so it is better to just walk or park in the Downtown Public Parking.

Hillel house was subject to a serious NIMBY attack back in 2001  2002 when they tried to remodel and expand.

Due to problems with funding, expansion of the Hillel House was put on hold for several years. However, the planning commission of Davis again approved a building project in October 2010. A twostory facility with a basement (for additional parking) was planned to replace the buildings located at 328 A St. and 322 A St.

Construction on the newest $5,000,000 Hillel House was completed in 2012. It has free wireless internet (for our students only), a Judaic library, a caf√©, a home theater system, a Kosher commercial kitchen (the only kosher kitchen in Yolo County), a large backyard and a spacious banquet room downstairs.

We at Hillel invite you to come and be a part of our vibrant and welcoming community.
