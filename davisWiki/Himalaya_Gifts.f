Hmmm..are they handicrafts from Tibet? or from Native Tibetans in India? I like the idea of supporting poor Tibetans though. Try looking on eBay first though.  Users/AnnaF

20100812 14:34:32 nbsp I bought two pairs of earrings from here for my friends.  I really liked their selection, not as much as Tibet Nepal but it was MUCH easier to browse through things and it seemed more organized.

The lady clerk at the time was very nice and patient with me (I browsed for a long time).  She polished the earrings after I bought them and but them in a standard gold jewelry box.

May be over priced but they are semi precious stones and unique. Users/BamCam

20140326 06:45:59 nbsp I have had the pleasure to shop here numerous times.  Since I have traveled to NEPAL many times I have experience with seeing this type of merchandise where it originates and know what similar items sell for IN Nepal.  This store has a great selection of quality items and their prices are very reasonable. I especially enjoy interacting with the owners who are Tibetans.   Users/MikePhillips
