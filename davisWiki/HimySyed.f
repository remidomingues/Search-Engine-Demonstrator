Im in Toronto Ontario Canada at the moment, but have lived on and off in the Bay Area since I was 16.

I hung out with my grandparents in Fremont, East Bay over the 20042005 winter and spring.

Im building a city wiki for wiki:Toronto and wiki:Mississauga and have been inspired from your collective experience here on DavisWiki.

If youre curious about me beyond wikis, see http://HiMYSYeD.TYO.ca here.
