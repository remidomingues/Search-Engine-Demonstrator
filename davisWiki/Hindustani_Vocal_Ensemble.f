The Hindustani Vocal Ensemble is a performance class (MUS 148) offered through the UC Davis Music Department. The class is instructed by renowned musician and Berkeley resident http://www.ritasahai.com/ Rita Sahai. The course focuses on the basics of Hindustani music through theory and practice.

The twounit class meets Mondays from 4 to 6 pm in the Music Building. Some people like the class so much that they keep taking it for no credit or after theyve graduated. The ensemble is open to all backgrounds and musical abilities  there are no prerequisite classes and students dont need previous experience. You wont find the class listed on the Open Courses website or the Course Catalog, but if you just show up on a Monday afternoon, you will be more than welcome to join.
