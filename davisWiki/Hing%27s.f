Hings was a Chinese food Chinese restaurant Downtown, but theyre Departed Businesses closed forever now.  Kabul Afghan Cuisine has taken their place.  They used to play a single song in a permanent loop.  The triplet percussion at the end drove it home every few minutes.

   I was going to be diplomatic and say its cheap and theres no wait, but since they went out of business a week after I ate there, Ill say it like it was: the worst food. At least of this lot. AllYouCanStand (instead of AllYouCanEat; youll leave before youre full. I rated them a 4, probably being a bit generous. This entry is now for historical purposes only since Hings is closed forever.
