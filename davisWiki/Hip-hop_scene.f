UC Davis once dead local hiphop scene is slowly returning to life.

 History 

With the rise of groups such as Anticon, and labels like Definitive Jux, to underground fame, came a flood of raw and talented hiphop groups to the Davis scene. A group called Rhyme Scheme begin the official new era of Davis hiphop back in 1999, years after the graduation of the men who put Davis on the hiphop map: DJ Shadow, Blackalicious, and the entire Quannum crew.

But what the hell happened? Even in late 2003 there was a hiphop alternative to the scene revolution nearly every week. Now there is nothing but the scattered and poorly attended performance.

2003 was the new golden age of Davis hiphop. This is the year of the highest concentration of talented, local acts. The problem is, Total Package, Plan B, The Jaded Emcees, iDeaLiSTiK, INE, Nostalgic Progression, and Eufonik all went away.

Maybe it was because of the lack of support. Certainly it is discouraging to see an only half filled show each and every performance. The problem with Davis hiphop fans is that they are fickle. They do not support the general scene but only their buddy in one of the groups. Reminiscent of Tryte fans, they leave when someone they dont know comes on stage.

At least some groups moved on. They did not die with the scene. Others stayed, but are hiding in the shadows, waiting for better times and more eager ears.

Davis is, for the most part, a cyclic place.  People come and they go, and while some make an impact, the impact can only last as long as others are willing to carry it.  There are certainly folks at KDVS who will not soon forget the great Hiphop scene that Davis had.

20041207 17:19:04 nbsp The davis hip hop scene has had its ups and downs. I think the real problem is the complete lack of coordination on the parts of the venues... Dunno if I have any bright ideas on getting the nightlife around here a little more organized, but Id be down to help.  Users/KenNeville

20041207 17:24:32 nbsp Yeah... there really are no places to play... that was the problem then and that is the problem now.  Users/EricWecker

20041218 23:11:12 nbsp I used to complain frequently that there was no venue for local music, but there are places to play if you are willing to work to make your own shows, and there are ways to get connected. Theres no real commercial venues to hop onto big shows with touring bands, but theres a good chance those venues dont want you anway. (unless you are brilliant red lights)  Users/JoeConte

Maybe this will help it out of the woodwork
