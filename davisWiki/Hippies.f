Image(FarmersMkt.jpg, 300, left, thumbnail) It is a matter of opinion as to if a college student who is a hippie for four to eight years, and then goes off to practice law in a power suit and raise 2.5 kids in a suburb ever really was a hippie.  That said, there are plenty of people in Davis who have been buying earth friendly goods since the late 60s/early 70s when the hippie movement started.

Many Hippies come to Davis for the Whole Earth Festival. Many Hippies are doing a degree in International Agricultural Development.

It might interest you that the term Hippie started out as a slur by Beatniks who were mocking the wannabe hipsters.  Thus, by a certain logic, there can be no such thing as a wannabe hippie, as they are, by label, all wannabes.

If said hippies still buy organic produce, recycle and wear hemp on the weekends, they are officially Yippies.
   I dispute this.  Im a big fan of Abbie Hoffman and friends, even used to be a phreaker,  but I fail to see how people who buy organtic, recycle and wear hemp have anything to do with the Youth International Party.  Unless youre making some sort of attempt at witty commentary, I believe you have mixed up your groups.  Users/JabberWokky jw

       wiki:WikiPedia:Yippies are a subculture that was very active during the late 60s through the late 80s, comprised the famous Chicago Seven, were known for their active protests via street theater and pranks on the media and established politics, and are still active today.  Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman were major political activists, going up against both the CIA and Democratic Party in the courtroom (Yippies are extreme leftists).  The term Yuppie is a spoof of the term Yippie, and was created over a decade after the term Yippie was commonly known.  Get a copy of wiki:WikiPedia:Steal_this_Book, start a pirate radio station, issue some press releases and spoof your caller ID.  You can find Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies Yippiesque activity in Davis and their LaRouche sworn opponents recruit on campus.  Yippie is a very distinct term and has nothing to do with organic produce or recycling and little to do with wearing hemp.  Users/JabberWokky jw

It appears that most people in Davis are a bunch of damn bicycle ridding hippies, who shop at the Co Op or nugget market for their lame ass organic groceries (they even bring their own grocery bags too), wear sandals (especially Teva brand), and think they know everything just because they went to the U.C. Davis (or just because they live near that college).  By the way, if Davis people/ hippies do not ride a bicycle, they either drive an electric car, hitchhike, or drive a sorry ass Subaru station wagon.  Anyways, I just thought that I should point out that Davis is basically a town full of hippies based upon my observation.  No hate mail please, I am just pointing out my observations. Users/buckbuck
   Well, that seems like a fair evalutation of Davis, you jackass.  Users/GeorgeLewis
