Until it was sold in 2013, the Historic Nelson Ranch was one of Yolo County Yolo Countys premier Horses horse boarding facility.  Over its lifetime, the ranch won numerous awards and was recognized for the quality of care and level of services they offer.  They were a high end facility with plenty of amenities and luxuries for riders to enjoy. Stalls ranged from $195 for a stall with paddock, self clean to $425 full care for the oversized stalls with extra large runs.

There were English and Western Historic Nelson Ranch Trainers trainers available.  Sabrina Hernandez Western and Beginning English Riding Sabrina Hernandez taught beginning to advanced Western and beginning English riding lessons and has a great kids riding program. Sabrina gave trail, equitation, horsemanship and showmanship lessons. She specialized in AQHA and APHA horses. She had finished show horses available for riding lessons to get children and adults started off riding correctly, with a positive attitude. She travelled to Davis barns and locations for private lessons with very reasonable prices.  Sabrina also offered a special summer program for children and students from Davis.

The Ranch also offered lay ups and rehabilitation for horses from UC Davis veterinary medical teaching hospital.
