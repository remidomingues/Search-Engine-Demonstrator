 Brief Historical Context 
see also Town History

 In 1850, Joseph B. Chiles acquired roughly 4,200 acres of the Rancho Laguna de Santo Calle Mexican land grant and later divided the land between his sonsinlaw, Jerome C. Davis and Gabriel Brown. Large agricultural production ranches developed over the next decade, and our young farming community came to be called  Putah Township by the 1860s. When the California Pacific Railroad came to town and established Davisville as a new township by 1871, the area became a legitimate agricultural center. In 1907, the University State Farm was established, and the character of the Davisville was forever changed as it embarked upon the road that would mark it by 1959 as a university town surrounding UC Davis.

 Other sites 

The City of Davis has four classes of historic cultural resource designation that recognize the local historic importance of buildings, areas and trees:
  Landmark is the highest local designation for a site or structure, usually one also eligible or actually listed on the national or state register
  Merit Resource is the next level
  Contributing means a structure would contribute to a potentially designated Historic District or neighborhood (Davis has 4 such districts, identified in historic resource surveys, but none have actually become designated districts so far.)
  Landmark Trees are trees outstanding for age, beauty, rarity or historic association.

 Other Places of Historic Interest 

  Bomb Shelter  Popular in the 1950s when future nuclear annihilation was a fact of life, the Bomb Shelter on Anderson Road now serves as a performance venue and a quiet reminder as to how lucky we are to not be living under a visible threat of immediate annihilation...
  Hog Barn  saved from demolition by a clause in the contract with the 1910era donor, the Hog Barn was moved onto the lawn on the north side of Bainer Hall in 2004, and in 2007 is finally being retrofitted as office space for a staff training facility.  Bainerites still bemoan the loss of about 60 high quality parking spaces and a 1950s era decorative concrete planter that were removed to make way for the hog barn.
