20050308 19:43:44 nbsp Did the College Republicans endorse choice voting?  I remember it being discussed in meetings, and DCR had a lot to gain in terms of representation from a proportional system, but I cant remember if there was an official endorsement. Users/ScottRitchie (Answer: Jonathan Otero endorsed.  At the time he was the President of the Davis College Republicans.  He would not, however, sign the endorsement form as the President.  Sarah Belarmino was another Davis College Republican who actually helped collect signatures.  Mike Dugas was also a supporter.  That was the only support from Republicans that I can remember. CJ

Prior to me writing a new section on endorsements passed in January 2005, Student Organizations werent allowed to endorse anything.  Well, sort of.  The campaign coordinator couldnt use the endorsement with a penalty of community service or something.  It was really weird.  Users/BrentLaabs
