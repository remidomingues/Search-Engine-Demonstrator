Every year, HSU members plan and facilitate this conference as an opportunity to outreach to high school students and provide a chance to meet other high school and college students. A pressing issue in the community is access to higher education. This conference seeks press that issue by motivating students toward higher education. The conference is also used as a forum to discuss issues in the Hmong community and to provide opportunities to ask questions about applying and attending college. Workshops such as financial aid, life as a college student and Hmong history will allow participants to have a chance to learn, teach and interact with others. There are also lighter topics such as Appreciation of Parents, hip hop lessons, and Hmong gender roles. HSU also sponsors an essay scholarship for high school seniors
