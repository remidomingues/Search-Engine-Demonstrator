Hoagland Hall Annex, or just The Annex is where the graduate students in Atmospheric Science live used to live, though theyve now moved upstairs.  Its essentially a garage converted into offices, which explains why they moved out.  The Biometeorology Group definitely had the best room, as its the only one where the air conditioner really works in the Summer.

Rumor has it that the Art Department will be taking over the space, which is way across campus from most of its offices.

It also has a workshop associated with UC Agriculture and Natural Resources DANR on the west side.
