The Hoes Down is an annual fall harvest festival coordinated by Full Belly Farm in Guinda. Because Full Belly is an organic farming operation run by what students like to call old hippies (exDavisites), it is dedicated to honoring and promoting the knowledge of agricultural arts and sustainable rural living through inspiration and education. The event is very kidfriendly and could be said to be what the Whole Earth Festival should be or possibly once was. Activities include hay rides, blacksmithing workshops, wine tasting, natural and homemade foods, ag workshops, a farmer/craft market, entertainment and farm tours. Full Belly is also a working farm yet opens its space to the community during this fundraising event for local and statewide organizations working on projects which benefit sustainable agriculture and rural communities. To get to Full Belly Farm, simply take Hwy 16 from the westmost corner of Woodland through the Capay Valley and on into Guinda  Full Belly is easy to spot on your right from the single lane country road.

Bicycle to the Hoes Down! Cyclists may contact Mailto(scvajda AT yahoo DOT com, Stephen) at (510) 3028119 to join a Davis contingent that will ride from the Davis Train Station. See the bike route map provided below. Its 44miles from Davis, and be prepared for heavy traffic and limited shoulder width on Highway 16. The route on this map avoids the highway as much as possible (without cutting across private property on dirt roads west of Capay):
