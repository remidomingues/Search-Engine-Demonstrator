The annual Holiday Meal is a free food dinner offered to the entire community. All the cooking, serving, greeting is done by volunteers and there are plenty of them. It is cooked in the large kitchen on the premises. There is also live entertainment on the band platform. It is sponsored by the Davis Food Coop, the City of Davis, Sodexho, along with other donors.

The long line from outside the building bifurcates into two serving lines. First you pick up a paper plate, plastic silverware, a napkin, and then walk down the serving line where you are offered various items (identified by cards). In 2005 there was: vegan mashed potatoes (with skins), vegan rice pilaf, vegan peas & carrots, vegan salad, and a choice of sliced ham, sliced turkey, or chicken. The cards made a big point that each was vegan. Another table has soft drinks, and two more tables have homemade dessert desserts. You are allowed your choice of four items from the dessert tables. The desserts REALLY are homemade where else can you get candy canes baked into cookies, chocolatecovered pretzels, and chocolate hemp brownies?

The meal is mediumsized, but there is no going back for seconds, owing to the long line of people not yet served. The food isnt much different from that served at the Tuesday night Davis Community Meals meals, except that probably higher quality ingredients are used here. On the way out each is given a small gift satchel. One contained two walnuts, two foilwrapped chocolate balls, and a small candy cane.

In 2005, there was no FREE table as shown in the photograph above.

In 2007, volunteers began working on new decorations to be used each year at the meal including this backdrop for the stage:
