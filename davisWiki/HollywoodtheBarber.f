20090616 18:46:55 nbsp Hi, Welcome to the Wiki and thanks for making the page about Vita Dolce Salon and Barbershop. You can link to it on the Beauty Salons and Barber Shops page just as in this comment, like {{{ Vita Dolce Salon and Barbershop}}} in whichever category you like. A bullet point is made with a space and then an asterisk at the beginning of the line. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090616 19:04:37 nbsp Yes, exactly. Just like you found the page with the links to other businesses, people will find your page also. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090619 17:57:43 nbsp If you go to http://daviswiki.org/Vita_Dolce_Salon_and_Barbershop?actioninfo and hover over the usernames you will see their IP addresses. The comments that triggered Users/JoePomidor to add the IP Address include macro were different than the IP address you are posting under. It is very possible that some veteran editors are weary and have acquired a battle field cynicism having dealt with a lot of sockpuppets and people removing other peoples contributions. When a page is created for a new business and there are a flood of comments about that business it keeps popping up in Recent Changes and the sudden activity may garner more attention.
As a separate issue please consider the importance of using your RealName, because using your real name is a way to acknowledge that this is a Wiki Community community. If you dont want to use your real name at least introduce yourself. Users/JasonAller Users/JasonAller

20090619 19:12:32 nbsp Thank you for introducing so many new users to the wiki, maybe some of them will stick around and contribute new pages, comments on other businesses, corrections, history about Davis, etc. It would be a shame if all they did with their new accounts was each leave a single comment on the page for your business.
