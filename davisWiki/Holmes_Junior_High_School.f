Holmes Junior High School is one of our local schools, and it was named in honor of wiki:WikiPedia:Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr..  Over the years Holmes has been home to some great Teachers in the Davis Joint Unified School District teachers including Pierre Neu, Larry Turner and Al Klinger. The campus opened in 1966. In addition to other classrooms, the library, and gym there are also metal and wood shops, though the school has dramatically cut back on its shop classes.

There used to be a Holmes Junior High School Parcourse parcourse along the west and south sides of the field, but very little is left of the original 20+ station course.

Just North of the track is a Evergreen grove Memorials dedicated to  http://occr.ucdavis.edu/news/view.cfm?news_id42 Andrew Mockus who died tragic events tragically.  On the night of April 24, 1992, 14yearold Andrew Mockus was brutally beaten and robbed of $2 by three other teens, then pushed into the side of a moving freight train and killed. The incident occurred in a gully near UC Davis.

Near the end of the school year 7th, 8th, and 9th graders have a Day on the Green and, in addition, the 9th graders go on the 9th grade trip.

The Holmes mascots mascot is a red star, with the collective name for Holmes teams and students being The Patriot(s). Previously (prior to 2002), the mascot was The Minuteman(men), but the mascot was changed so as to be genderneutral.  The school colors are black and light blue (although this is debateable, as roughly five other color combinations are used, depending on who you ask).

Users/NickSchmalenberger Nick recalls something about there being a bulldog mascot.

They voted for the change in mascots aroundabouts 200203.  Users/MasonMurray Mason was in roughly 8th grade and remembers that it was vaguely related to 911 and wanting to seem more patriotic, and may have had something to do with all the press about pit bulls attacking people.
