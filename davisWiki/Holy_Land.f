Holy Land is an infamous party incepted by the original Party King, Rob Ray... (note the name is Rob Ray not Users/RobRoy another Party King Of Davis.

Holy Land is a themed, progressive party. Themed in that you must dress up. Progressive in the sense that it moves from house to house, and also that it is the future of partying.

  Holyland I   Spring of 2002

The theme was Holyland... that is, you get dressed in biblical gear (robes, etc.) get drunk, and walk to seven different houses, each themed to a different sin... I may be mistaken but I think it took place in North Davis.

  Holyland II  Summer of Love
Same idea, but with sixties gear.

  Holyland III  Trick or Drink.
It was Holyland on Halloween, October 2003. This was not a numbered Holyland, as traditional Holylands happen in Spring. The Holyland party concept was transformed into the moving Halloween party.
   This actually was a numbered Holyland... Holylands can happen whenever you want them to, not just in the spring Users/JoshuaHeller

  Holyland IV  Thrift Store Prom
Jenn Dietz took over the reigns as party maestro in 2004, and threw a Holyland with a buy suits and dresses from Woodland theme (ie. Salvation Army Woodland ) There were five houses, at the final house they were to decide upon a Holyland King and Queen... but nobody remembers anything about that. It was Fall quarter 2004 (?)

  Holyland V  Return to the Promised Land
This was a reprisal of the original Holy Land. Led by Jenn Dietz and Users/JoshuaHeller. Over 200 people showed up. Again each house was themed to a different sin (my house was gin and tonics dyed red,white, and blue to represent the sin of Pride.) There was lots of drunken debauchery... the slogan When the booze is gone we move on was codified.

  Holyland VI  Circus Theme
Took place the first week of Spring quarter 2006. Everyone dress up as a circus character, from an Elephant shit mover to clowns. There was plenty of http://oeaschwab.livejournal.com/6257.html debauchery.

  Holyland VII  Holy Land Goes Hollywood
This took place the second Friday of Spring quarter 2007.

  Holyland VIIIHoliday Theme
Took place spring quarter 2008.  Everyone dressed up as a different holiday/holiday character, such as cupid, a groundhog, Cesar Chavez, Mothers Day, Picnic Day, etc.  Each house had a holidaythemed drink (i.e. Halloween was spiced rum, Saint Pattys day was beer, 4th of July was red and blue Jello shots, etc) There were seven houses, ending with the New Years house. Many began the journeyonly the strongest survived to the finish.

 Holyland IX90s Theme
Took place spring quarter 2009.  This theme was so much more than what people initially think of when you say 90s.  No, people did not wear flannel, baggy shirts, and backwards hats.  Instead it was toys, movies, people, etc that were popular from the 90s.  For example some great ones were a furby, a NOW CD, tetris, mario cart characters, catdog, Alex Mac, Titanic and the iceberg, Ace Ventura, tamagotchis, Blossom, etc.  The various houses included Nickelodeon slime with green jello shots, Baywatch with sex on the beach, the Macarena with tequila sunrises, Titanic with Jack and Coke, Monica Lewinski with pink panty droppers.

 Holyland XReturn to Holyland
Took place spring quarter 2010.  Another year as a tribute to the original Holyland.  Again each of the houses were one of the seven sins.  Sloth  beer, wrath  kamikazes, pride  red and blue jello shots, Greed  goldschlager and coke, etc. Some of the costumes included the easter bunny (the eggs she carried around were filled with condoms, hurray), Jesus on the cross (literally, one person was the cross, the other was jesus), the golden calf, the snake from the garden of eden, Mary Magdalene, a dove, The Red Sea, the Pope, Veggie Tales.

An interesting side note, about Ancient Greek Comedy...

Groups of drunken revelers would wander around the city dressed in Phallic costumes, singing songs to Dionysus, followed by a flute player... the group was called a Comus, the songs they sang were called Comoedias.

From this ProtoHolyland, (so proto, its before the actual holy land) we can learn one thing  Holyland equals Comedy.
