 Food 

 Food Not Bombs 
Food Not Bombs serves free vegetarian meals every Sunday around 1:00PM at the bench in the center of Central Park. Its not charity; its a protest! is their slogan. This is the best food anywhere, at the best price. The plates sometimes have a little grease film on them, so you may wish to wash yours or bring your own plate. It isnt nearly enough to be a health hazard though. The food is almost always Vegetarian Options vegan, meaning no egg or dairy products are used as well as no meat. Most of the people eating here appreciate the absence of meat, but a few want meat. The almost refers to the occasions when prepared meat items were donated to them, and they passed them on.

FNB in many cities has a history of abuse from the police. Happily, there have not been any confrontation with the authorities in Davis for a long time. So you may eat in peace.

 Davis Community Meals 
Davis Community Meals serves two free meals every week at The Episcopal Church of St. Martin: dinner on Tuesdays at 5:45PM and lunch on Saturdays at 11:30AM. The days menu is posted at the head of the serving area, which is served cafeteria style, sort of. Once you get to the head of the queue, the servers pick up a tray and pass it down the line as each server asks you whether you want that particular food item or not. They insist on holding your tray until the end (this is stupid, but whatever). The tables are preset with silverware and a napkin, so you just sit down and eat. There are always empty spots.  Juice is available at lunch and 6 ounce cartons of 2% milk at dinner. The food is middleoftheroad American fare, never anything gourmet or ethnic as that would cause problems among those with less sophisticated palates. Theres always meat, but the meals are not meatbased. In other words, theres a bit of meat, but not a lot of meat. There are always several vegetarian items. They always have a large selection of singleserving desserts, such as pie, cake, brownies, etc. In the summertime the lunches are served and eaten outdoors. As expected, the evening meal is larger and offers more choices than the lunchtime meal. After everyone has been served, you may return for seconds if you wish (I rarely do this, as one almost always gets enough the first time through). This place deserves points for being a no questions asked place. Just show up, stand in line, get your food, and eat. This is a safe, peaceful place; no need to worry about that. There is no proselytizing, however you will be subjected to live piano and/or violin music and tap dancing. About 60 people eat at the Thursday meal.

 H.E.L.P. 
H.E.L.P. (Help & Education Leading to Prevention) is a studentrun community service club at UCD that was established in 2007. They are dedicated to promoting awareness of poverty and preventing it through community involvement. They serve two weekly meals for the homeless and lowincome individuals around Davis. The first meal is on Monday evenings at 6 pm at the Cesar Chavez Plaza Cesar Chavez Development on Olive Drive (next to The Lexington Lexington Apts), and the second meal is on Thursday evenings at 6 pm at  The Episcopal Church of St. Martin. They cook and serve the meals onsite and usually there is plenty of food available to take home.  These meals are served restaurant style where the plates are personally brought to the guests in the main dining room by an enthusiastic and friendly college student staff.

 Davis Community Church 
A free sack lunch (aka the sack snack) can be gotten from the Davis Community Church, which is the big church across the street from Central Park, Monday through Friday, at 11:30AM to noon. Its known as the sack snack due to its meager size. The few times I had it, it consisted of a ramen noodle cup, a childsize apple juice container, and airlinefoodtype crackers with artificial peanut butter (or something) filling. Most homeless people just bypass this as its not worth the bother.

 Food Closet 
This is operated out of the Pole Line Road Baptist Church. It is available Monday, Tuesday and Friday, 9amnoon 530/7534315. They provide canned goods and staple food items to families; snack type food to transients according to http://webiii.yolocounty.org:81/search~S0?/aPole+Line+Road+Baptist+Church./apole+line+road+baptist+church/3%2C1%2C0%2CE/frameset&FFapole+line+road+baptist+church&1%2C1%2C this.

 Grace in Action

On Tuesdays, there is mobile outreach that meets with people throughout the community. GIA volunteeers are very warm and friendly, though they will insist that you sign in and tell them about yourself.

20101001 16:51:50 nbsp Prompted by remembering my runin with The Crying Girl, I thought about homeless who were real.

A while back in Denver one evening, I a young girl who sniffled and cried a bit I bought a bus ticket to her home back in Florida. She was begging for change and said she didnt have much more time before she had to run because the shelter was going to close up for the night. She was quite happy to walk to the station with me and get the ticket I bought her. I also got her a sandwich that she gratefully accepted. She had run away from home thinking it would be better and it wasnt. Her mom would take her back, she just thought it was so dreadfully boring at her home in Florida.

Ive given a few bucks to a couple of the homeless regulars downtown Davis, but mostly just talk to them once in a while about this and that. They are human beings after all. Theres Kevin, the big crewcut guy who is in and out of rehab, in and out of living in a storage locker or an apartment, once in a while lays up in the bushes. These days hes working. When hes not using, hes a good person. If hes on ecstasy hes quite fun and philosophical, very friendly. If hes on meth ...

I dont remember the name of the older guy with the dog. But hes very friendly and pleasant. Doesnt seem to be an alky or a user, I couldnt figure him out. Users/YogaBhoga

20101220 23:40:34 nbsp As a member of the homeless community I feel obligated to respond to the comment by YogaBhoga.
First, The Kevin you mention is not homeless. He in NO way represents the homeless population of Davis. Further more, he is a threat to EVERYONE in our community.
He is responsible for the death of a 17yearold c. 1985. He has been charged with felony reckless child endangerment (the child aged 4) in 1998, as well as felony assault on an offduty, injured davis police officer. He forcefully took the officers crutches and proceeded to beat him with them. On two different occasions (2008 and 2010) he battered women he knew to be pregnant. During the summer of 2009 he beat and bloodied a 16yearold boy, in what everyone hoped to be his third and final felony, only to have charges dismissed by the district attorney. In the summer of 2010 he beat a woman in her 50s in order to steal her bottle of whisky. Two female davis residents have sought and received orders of protection/nocontact orders. Court orders that he routinely violates. Even the Davis Police have expressed their frustration at his continued presence, and one officer expressed his desire to erase his presence from Davis altogether.
It sickens me that this is the individual choses to prove the point that homeless people are human.
We are human. He is a monster Users/SmellyGroundHog

20110707 13:56:31 nbsp I agree with what SmellyGroundhog has to say. Kevin is  a danger to all and a prime example of our lazy police department and justice system. One police officer in davis remarked that if I had the chance, i would hang him downtown for all to mock.  Users/JustinYoder

20130923 09:05:19 nbsp There is a homeless group apparently living in Community Park now, mostly next to the swimming pool across from the tennis courts, or else they hang there most of the day and find places to sleep elsewhere. I counted 1015 at a time over this weekend, both days. I guess word is out that Davis is a nice place to come. They keep to themselves mostly, but I worry about incidents happening. A few have laptops. Most of this group seemed to be the highend functional homeless. Their lives are organized, they have bikes and trailers. I think one of them is a grad student that I think I recognize. (No, not the freegan former grad student in transportation who seems to be mentally ill that was on Colbert.) A real grad student should have priority in Davis I guess. Theres been several UC Davis students who have slept in tents to afford tuition  for years. And it was raining this weekend, and they need places to get out of the wet. The picnic table shelters work for that. Not sure how to respond to this. On the one hand, this bunch seemed like middle class people fallen on hard times. On the other hand, whats this going to turn into as word gets out about what a fine place Davis is to come?
