Wikishirts are so hot right now.




 Do It Yourself 

Ive got a silk screen, is it cool if I use some of the flyer images for shirts? Users/AmeliaCarlson aec
   Absolutely.  Everything on the wiki is fair game. Users/MikeIvanov

   hey aec, where did you get the silkscreen? i went to the bookstore but they were rather clueless. maybe i was talking to the wrong people. get a higher res jpeg from philip for the shirts.  Users/arlenabraham

   arlen. you probably were talking to someone clueless about the art department in the bookstore, becuase we sell all kinds of sizes of bars, and we also have two kinds of silkscreens  but since you are doing it at inkmonkey, no worries anymore Users/KristinRicherson

   I got mine in Santa Cruz, & havent been able to find a store in Davis that has any supplies. There should be places in Sacramento Sac. Ill check on it. Users/AmeliaCarlson aec

   or check at the Craft Center.  Users/AlphaDog
  http://www.universityart.com/sac.htm University Art in Downtown Sacramento sells them as well as http://www.forwhatyouneed.com/ Art Ellis. Theyre both located on J St practically across the street from eachother. Users/KristenBirdsall

Sweet tshirt man. I want one! Users/JackHaskel

That photo of arlen is the hottest thing ever. Users/PhilipNeustrom

Or do what Friends Urging Campus Kindness does! Make stencils and spraypaint peoples shirts on the quad. (with their permission of course)  Users/KenBloom

Users/TarZxf Tarz had this idea but has no comp, so Im posting: I (wiki symbol) Wiki in the I heart NY style... oh yes Users/MichelleAccurso Michelle

 Get a Free Shirt 

I (along with Users/RobRoy, Users/KristenBirdsall, and Users/MikeyNolan) managed to Free or cheap clothes put together our own silkscreen and purchase a bunch of tshirts from Thrift stores.  I gave about 10 of the shirts away, but I have a few more and plan to make a __ton__ more.  The only cost (now that the screen is made) is the shirts to print them on.  If anyone wants to donate a shirt Id gladly screen on the design.  Otherwise just talk to me or someone you see with a shirt on and well try and get you one.  If you want one just drop a note on this page with your shirt size and I will try and make you one. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Way cool everyone. Id like a medium!!  Users/JackHaskel
  If you have a color other than white, Ill take a large, and would be willing to donate a few bucks to the Wiki in kind appreciation. Users/CraigBrozinsky
  Nice job guys, I love the new shirts!  Users/MikeIvanov
  I want one!  And maybe Ill add a box and tape a pen to the back...
  I want one and Ill pay for the cost of the shirt... as soon as you pay me back for the security deposit!  I wear M and color is negotiable.  Users/KenjiYamada
  Philip, can I get a shirt to you somehow and have you screen the design on?  Drop me a note on my page if you can, thanks!   Users/KalenRidenour
  I want to be sexy like Arlen. I would like a medium sized shirt, just small enough so people can associate my rippling muscles (or rather, the absence of them) with the Wiki and think... if only I could be that cool, let me check this Wiki thing out.  I do, however, like the Edit this TShirt part of Robs stencil... any chance of putting that line on the back of the shirt? Any color except orange and yellow. I can pay, (waves hand) Republic credits will do fine. Users/KarlMogel email me at karl@ktkgalaxy.net if theres a shirt for me!
  I would totally rock one of these! Ill go find a shirt...  Users/BrianFong



 Buy a TShirt, Financially Support the DavisWiki 

Would there be any interest in setting up an account with something like http://www.cafepress.com Cafe Press to sell DavisWiki tshirts online?  I dont know too much about it, but I think it would require little more time and investment than the development of the designs.  This might be a great way to get more word out about the wiki and at the same time get more donations coming in.  This method of promotion is increasingly popular among nonprofits, for example LUGOD (see their http://www.lugod.org/shop/ shop).  Users/MichaelGiardina might also be able to describe his experiences with CafePress as it looks like he is selling a book through them.

Anyone have thoughts or concerns about this?  A good idea, or friggin crappy?

As I said above, Id be willing to pay real money for a Davis Wiki shirt, especially if it says Edit this Tshirt, like on the back. Users/KarlMogel

  The only problem with Cafe Press shirts is that they dont last through enough washes. Itd be ideal to get it screen printed somewhere. Users/DatNguyen
  Why do Cafepress when we have Ink Monkey Graphics Ink Monkey and Screaming Squeegee right here?  The wiki is all about being on the local level, so why not use local businesses?  If you order enough shirts, the price per for resale is pretty cheap, and the wiki could make bank.  Users/AllisonEriksen
  The nice thing about CafePress is that theres no upfront cost other than what appears to be a monthly fee of $5$7, and we wouldnt have to coordinate the jobs. The downside is that their base price is pretty steep... $15 for a plain grey tshirt. Wed have to charge $20 just to make $5 profit. Users/AlphaDog
