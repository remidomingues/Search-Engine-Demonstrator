Homestead Cooperative Housing Coop was a SCHA Solar Community Housing Association property, opened in 1996. It was aimed at residents with low income and single parent families.

There are four buildings on the oneacre site. One was built in the 1920s and another was built in the 1930s; both were reroofed and extensively remodeled in 1996, using both conventional and recycled construction materials. Two other buildings were designed by Davis architect Jim Zannetto and built from the ground up. They incorporate several passive solar design principles, and an active heating & cooling roof technology.

In 2005, Community Housing Opportunities Corporation (CHOC) & Yolo Community Care Continuum (YCCC) jointly applied for funding to assume ownership of Homestead. The funding requests, submitted to the City of Davis http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/programs/home/index.cfm Home Investment Partnership program as well as  the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/cdbg/cdbg.cfm Community Development Block Grant program, proposed developing Homestead to help address the need for affordable housing for individuals with a mental illness. Although the residents may have a real voice in the internal governance of Homestead, it is no longer residentcontrolled housing in a way that qualifies it as a coop under the http://www.davisfood.coop/whatis.html international Definition. So, despite the presence of the sign, there hasnt really been a Homestead Coop since 2005.

Occasionally there is Mysterious Abandoned Food on the greenbelt near the entrance to Homestead Coop.


20050524 23:52:56 nbsp Homestead is a really cute looking CoOp. Though Ive only been there at night. But its tucked away in a neighborhood. Very neat layout and the room(s) you have to yourself are pretty nice. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050711 02:23:55 nbsp I heard this place has been bought and is changing. All the residents have to leave, any comments? Users/MichelleAccurso
  We visited for a friend who is moving to the area and was interested, and saw a paper about how the state was going to be changing it into housing for disabled people or something, but we thought it was a few years off. They never really got back to our friend (hence the hard to get ahold of comment above); perhaps this explains it. Users/JessicaLuedtke
  Thats sad, I mean I guess it would work, singlelevel homes with ramps, but theyd have to cut all the overgrown glory that is the Homestead Coop. Dang, I liked that Coop and wanted to move in. :( Users/MichelleAccurso

  So, is it clear from the above that neither students nor families live here, and that it is not a coop? It is for individuals with a mental illness, most of whom are (I believe) not engaged in study or raising a family while they are residents. (However, client confidentiality would probably preclude anyone from definitively answering this question.) Users/DougWalter
