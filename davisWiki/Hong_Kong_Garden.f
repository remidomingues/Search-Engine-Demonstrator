Chinese food restaurant that offered Delivery delivery.  It was one of the only places in Davis that sold Lo Mein.  This location used to be the Golden Garden Restaurant.  On 9/20/06, ownership again changed hands, and the location now holds Wok of Flame.


New management as of September 2006.

I thought their potstickers and moo shu were terrible. But the chow mein wasnt bad. Users/MiriamKaufman

20060807 19:40:49 nbsp I wasnt impressed.  I went there with my boyfriend for dinner one night, and there was only one other table with people seated, making the atmosphere incredibly uncomfortable.  Not only that, they seated us right NEXT to the other people (in the booths), so we felt like we had to whisper.  There was no background music, and the food was OK but nothing stellar.  I dont think Ill go back. Users/SteffiChristiana
