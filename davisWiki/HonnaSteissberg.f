20090523 08:20:56 nbsp Welcome to the wiki! Can I ask why you would want to make your http://daviswiki.org/Greystone?actiondiff&at_date1243059233.6086199 positive review anonymous? Also, it probably wasnt your intention, but when you replaced {{{Users/HonnaSteissberg}}} with {{{Anonymous}}}, you linked to an entry that doesnt exist. If you really want to change your signature, it would be better to make it {{{  Anonymous}}}, with no linking. Although the best thing would be to only leave reviews youre comfortable attaching to your name.   Users/ElleWeber

20090523 09:58:17 nbsp Hey, you should also keep in mind that all editing on the wiki is logged, so anybody can click the Info icon at the top of any page and see who made any edit, now or back to the beginning of the entry.  Were a pretty friendly community; its just to see who did what so were all able to communicate and work together.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
