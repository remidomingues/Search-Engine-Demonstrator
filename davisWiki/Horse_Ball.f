  The team with the ball in their possession must pass the ball between their players at least three consecutive times, before attempting to score a basket.

Charlottes Tips For Getting Your Horse Ball Team Started:
1. Find four or more confident riders who are interested in playing (all horses and riders should be comfortable riding at the walk, trot and canter)
2. Get your horses accustomed to the ball using positive reinforcement on the ground, then under saddle. Horses should feel comfortable walking, trotting and cantering shoulder to shoulder with other horses while the ball is being passed.
3. Call Coach John S. Malbos and join the league




Although Horse Ball Davis is a recreational riding league, the international federation of horseball (FIHB) establishes and edits rules for international competition, which are followed by all national organizations. You will always find the last uptodate version at http://www.fihbhorseball.org
