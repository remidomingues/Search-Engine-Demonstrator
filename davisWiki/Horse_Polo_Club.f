The HORSE POLO CLUB is managed by the mens and womens UC Davis competitive team members, who have come in first at the Regional Competition for the last 6 years.  The team offers weekly clinics to teach anyone how to play the game.  It is a great alternative to the Equestrian Center Prices and so much fun!  There is absolutely no riding or horse experience necessary.  Clinics are available from beginners through advanced, for whether you are interested in learning about horses or in a position on the team. Horses and equipment are provided, bringing boots is suggested, and any other personal equipment (excluding horses) is welcome.
