Has trails around facility, 3 arenas, round pen, trailer parking and obstacle course. Love this place... highly recommended!  Users/aolstad

20110213 13:34:27 nbsp I have had my horse here for about two years and Ive been really happy with the place. Board for a stall is $315 which is fairly affordable compared to other places in Davis. They have paddocks, but most of the paddocks do not have covered shelters and they are usually all full. The stalls all have attached paddocks. The manager is nice and accommodating, though he can be difficult to get ahold of sometimes. They do a great job keeping the stalls clean and feeding. My horse is a hard keeper and I always had him on supplements to keep weight on him at other places, but at HQ they feed as much as your horse requires to keep good weight, whether its one flake or four, and I havent needed to supplement my horse. A lot of other places in Davis try to skimp on hay, and your horse ends up underfed. I have boarded at several places in Davis, and so far this is my favorite. There are all kinds of riders that board there, western and english, competitive and recreational, trail riders and retired horses. Everyone is really friendly and it doesnt have that snobby stable feeling. Users/chamomile
