Horses are fairly popular in Davis, neigh? UC Davis being an agricultural school, the mascot Gunrock, and our worldclass Vet Med Teaching Hospital its probably happened that Students students brought their horse with them to UC Davis.  Mason Thomas is a law firm that has experience in equine law.  There are probably even more people who just love horses and want to find out where they can get some experience with them. This page hopes to bring you all things related to both Davis and horses.
