Sometimes in the morning if you look out to the west of Davis town youll see one or more hot air balloons.  Other times, the balloons fly directly over town.

When weather conditions are bad (fog) in Napa, the Napa balloons often come over to Winters or Dixon to launch. They also sometimes launch from Yolo County Airport at West Covell Boulevard and County Road 95. The balloons you see in the north are mostly launching from the Yolo County Fairgrounds in Woodland.
