Hot Sauce is what puts the spicy foods zing in your day! Because Weather winter in Davis tends to be wet and dreary, youll need this Magic Items of Davis magic stuff to keep that fire burning in your belly. Being a town of semicultured foodies, most supermarkets & grocery stores stock a decent selection of these spicy condiments, and what cant be found there can either be found in your favorite ethnic markets international food store, Ikedas, or Pedrick Produce. If youve got a hot pick, add it to our list along with a description of the flavor and heat. Those who prefer their hot sauce on top should check out our Food page for places to find accompaniments.

For a sauce that originated in Davis (but has since gone national and moved out of town), try WingTime.  Afghan Pepper Company is trying to become the new Davisoriginated hot sauce.

 Hot Sauces Available in Davis

   Busha Brownes Pukka Sauce  Nugget  Although pretty mild in the grand range of liquid fires available, this Jamaican Scotch Bonnet pepper sauce still packs a punch compared to the most common sauces. Slightly sweet. ~4,440 SHU
  Chipotle Tabasco  This can be found at Chipotle of all places. It can also be found at grocery stores like Safeway (though not necessarily the ones in Davis).

  Daves Total Insanity Sauce  This stuff really is insanely hot! The flavor isnt great though
 a red sauce kinda on the vinegary side. As a fairly wellseasoned veteran of hot sauces, I wouldnt recommend more than a drop or two at the absolute most until you figure out what you can handle. One friend swore it permanently damaged her taste buds.  And remember to wash your hands after handling the bottle...and unless you want to go insane, dont touch your eyes when using this stuff! ~180,000 SHU
    Im pretty sure Ive seen it at Pedricks.  Look low, where all the contains mostly capsaicin sauces are.  Lots of black or burned cardboard boxes.  Users/JabberWokky
    purchased at cost plus world market in Davis sometime during early 2007 (who actually have a couple interesting hot sauces for those who are looking). indeed, flavor is mediocre, but its extraordinary heat is good for big batches of stuff...or on pizza. additionally wiki:WikiPedia:Capsaicin capsaicin (see mechanism of action)  does not actually harm you.  Users/MiranPark
  Daves Ghost Pepper Sauce  Cost Plus World Market, Nugget  At a whopping 650,000 SHU, this is one of the hottest sauces available in the area.
  Del Scorcho  Del Taco ... Much better than Taco Bells Fire Sauce, but still not the liquid ulcer hot sauce of which aficionados dream.
  Franks Red Hot Buffalo Sauce  Nugget, Jack in the Box, Sams Club Sams Club (not in davis)  Ask for it with anything you order.  Its very useful. ~450 SHU

 Hot Sauces Consumed In, but Not Necessarily Available In Davis 
If these are available in town, say where.

  Ass in the Tub  This red cayenne based sauce has a really good flavor and its hot, but bearable though you can expect a good 15min lip burn.  No vinegar, so the cayenne really shines through.
  Crazy Jerrys Brain Damage Mind Blowin Hot Sauce  If the hot pink cap molded to look like a brain doesnt grab your attention the flavor will. Ingredients: Mandarin oranges, honey, mango fruit habanero peppers, distilled vinegar, water, garlic, chipotle peppers, sugar, spice.
  Valentina  For that sabor autentico.  Comes in regular, hot, and extra hot. Its yummy on eggs and beans...really anything. (except cereal)
  XXX Calypso Hot  I think I ordered this stuff online from a place in Louisiana the year I tried to make gator chili; looks like the sauce is made in the Tortolas, BVI though.  Its a red sauce with a bonnet pepper base. Nice texture with chunks of pepper seed, but a bit thick. Definitely one of the hotter ones Ive tried. Not too much vinegar and not nearly as hot as Daves Insanity Sauce; Id recommend starting with just a few drops to be safe.
    In the its a small world category, I met the woman who makes that the last time I went down to the Virgin Islands.  There are a dozen or so good hot sauce companies down there, and its one of their few exports.  Users/JabberWokky



20050618 20:51:31 nbsp the beer page really needs to take inspiration from this page and have a list of the best available labels and where to buy them.  mmm... beer.  beer and hot sauce. Users/CarlMcCabe
 Does it seem odd to anyone else that more care has been given to hot sauce than to beer?  Arent we supposed to be a college town?! :) Users/SummerSong ss

20050706 16:03:23 nbsp The Reserve of which you mention is Blairs Death.  The biggest reason for me to drop the $15+ for entrance fees at The Book And The Cook Fair in Philly was visiting the Blairs Death booth and buying a case of Blairs Death Cheese Sauce.  Your sauce can be found http://hotsauce.com/searchresult.aspx?Manufacturer4 here.  Im a weenie, I know, but I forgot how to do the linky thing. Users/BlancheNonken

20120130 01:12:33 nbsp Coop has  Boulder Hot Sauce Company. Difficult to find outside of Boulder and in my opinion the best balance between heat and flavor ever invented. I prefer their Smokey Serano over Harrys Habenero but theyre both outstanding. Users/MikeyCrews
