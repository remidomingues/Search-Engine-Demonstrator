 List of Hot Tubs by Complex  




 Hot Tub Protips 
 Dos and Donts 
As with anything, discretion and common sense are beneficial when selecting a hot tub destination.  For instance, if you are bringing a large crew and intend on drinking and making noise, dont go to a quiet tub and expect to not ruffle feathers. Quiet complexes do not make for a good time when in large groups. Especially when patronizing a hot tub at a complex of which you are not a resident, remember that the hot tub is there for everyones enjoyment, not just yours.  Think of it as a natural resource it is there to be enjoyed but not exploited.  Dont ruin it for others by making a mess.

DO
Be friendly and introduce yourself.  Talk to your fellow hot tubbers. Offer to share if you have extra beer. Drink water. PICK UP YOUR TRASH.

DONT
Dont be a creep. Dont be too loud be mindful of the time of night. Dont leave your trash. Dont drink too much, it is easy to get dehydrated. Dont be that dbag that brings a boombox and plays crappy music.


Getting In
Ease of accessibility is assessed in the above table.  Nearly all hot tubs are fenced in and locked.  Easy ones simply requiring reaching your hand over or under the fence to turn the handle, oftentimes this is possible.  More difficult tubs may require jumping the fence.


Hot Tub Council
The hot tub council (HTC) is a tradition that originates at UC Merced and was brought to us by visiting Merced students.  The rules differ everywhere but the basic premise is as follows:
A place for friends and strangers to meet and relax.  Bitch about your problems, complain about classes or work, formulate battle plans and strategies for meeting members of the opposite sex, etc.  HTC usually involves consuming some form of alcohol.  The original Merced charter had a strict constitution that involved making a new rule every meeting, and adjourning every meeting with a lap in the pool. The Davis chapter doesnt abide by such foolish rules.
