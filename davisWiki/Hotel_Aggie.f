Hotel Aggie existed where Shuz of Davis & Nestware later occupied. At one point, it operated as a real hotels hotel in the Terminal Hotel building. Later on it became one of those apartment/homes that transformed into a great club/party place by night. Popular with KDVS crew back in the eighties and hosted such notables as Thin White Rope (http://moonhead.linklord.com/ website), Game Theory (http://www.loudfamily.com/game.html article), Camper van Beethoven (http://www.campervanbeethoven.com/ website), etc. The bottom level of the Aggie Hotel was once home to Debos Pizza, then a bars bar known as the Antique Bizzare and later on another restaurant the original La Esperanza while a small staircase on the side of the building led up to a couple small apartments which were probably originally hotel rooms.
