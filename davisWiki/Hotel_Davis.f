20080501 18:42:04 nbsp Office staff was extremely rude to me.  They dont guarantee rooms before 3 pm but then state that early check in wont be a problem and if you show up early they will clean a room right a way for you which in itself is a guarantee.  However, that is not what happened in my case and the person I booked the room for had to wait 4 hours to get a room.  The manager is completely unwilling to deal with any customer issues and does not believe her staff could have done anything wrong even when they are lying to the manager about statements they made to customers on multiple occasions.  In the case of this hotel the customer is always wrong, and the office staff can lie and treat customers terribly without any recourse for their actions. I would never recommend getting a room at this location since they are totally unreasonable.  Rooms are very pricey as well for the type of service you receive.  Very sad that they arent going to even learn anything from the situation so that their staff could learn to better communication with customers at the very least.  If you have to stay here try to deal with Megan since she is the only one there that knows how to talk to customers without yelling at them. Users/SandraBallentine

20090531 04:30:06 nbsp Ive been around this hotel since it first opened, as my mother was one of the original employees. Ive been working there for a year and a half now, and there are a couple things about the hotel that are good for any prospective guest or employee to know about it.

First and foremost, this isnt a big hotel in any way. There are only about 15 employees, many of whom are related. Parents, children, siblings. Were a fairly closeknit bunch as far as jobs go. This also means that we know the hours and habits of each employee fairly well.

We can do quite a bit to help guests out, within obvious bounds. We dont really have the resources for concierge services and such, but if you need something and we cant get it, we almost always know where to get it. Most of the employees, the front desk workers in particular, are locals, or even allout Townies like me. We know the area. One of the highlights of my day is when Im able to help a guest, to teach them a bit about Davis.

In regards to the previous comment, its important to remember the key words dont guarantee. Its common sense that if something is not guaranteed, you shouldnt count on it. Therefore, regardless of foretold probability, theres no reasonable excuse to be upset over it. We DO NOT guarantee rooms before 3pm, though if a suitable room is clean before then and we arent busy, it can sometimes be done. Keep in mind that check out is at 11AM (not counting the occasional late check out that we allow), so if the room is occupied the night before, it will take about half an hour to get it clean after the previous guest clears out. Probably the earliest that is likely on anything but a REALLY slow day is 12 noon. Also remember that as an early check in at any time, we are making an exception already. Many hotels will charge extra for this service, but we have not within memory. So if youre wanting us to bend the terms for you, a polite attitude and some patience is very much appreciated.

On the same note, our check in BEGINS at 3, but you are welcome to check in any time after that... even 2AM is fine, though you will be charged the full nights stay regardless. Its a common call I get in the afternoons, people afraid we will give their rooms away if they arent here in time. We will not, I assure you.

Since the renaming, while the hotel is very much the same, we do have a couple of small changes. A new computer system lets us work faster and send email confirmations, a slightly more boutique style of decoration is starting to sneak in, and we are also in the process of developing a frequent guest program. Please feel free to call Hotel Davis anytime, 24/7, for any information. Users/KBathory
