Hour of Power is a Drinking games drinking game.  It has also mistakenly been called Power Hour.

The concept of the Hour of Power is pretty simple. All you need is a lot of beer (~8 beers/person), a shot glass for each person, and a clock. Simply take a shot of beer every minute for one hour. This is a pretty popular game in Davis as well as other parts of the country.

Youve got to have some method of keeping track of the time or else things can get sloppy fast. One recommended method is to make a Hour of Power mix of 60 songs that play for one minute each, that way you can take a shot every time a new song comes on. Some might argue that making a Hour of Power Playlist is half the fun.

The Numbers

  Hour of Power: 90 oz of beer, or 7.5 beers in 60 mins.

  Century Club: 150 oz of beer, or 12.5 beers in 100 mins.

  Edward 40 Hands: 80oz (6 2/3 beers) of malt liquor (or beer) as quickly as you can drink it.

For those that have already mastered the Hour of Power, the next step would be to join the Century Club...
