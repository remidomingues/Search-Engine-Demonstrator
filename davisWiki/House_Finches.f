House Finches or Carpodacus mexicanus can be seen throughout town. These small birds can be found around cafes. Not to be confused with the chunkier House Sparrow, the House Finch is a small bodied bird with short wings and a slightly notched tail. Males have a rosy reddish head and breast, while females are streaky brown. In a rare mutation, males have golden yellow feathers rather than red.

House Finches dont migrate and can be found in Davis year round. The House Finch is often found in small flocks and is easily drawn to bird feeders.
