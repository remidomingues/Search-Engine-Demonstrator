20050729 12:46:05 nbsp The best Honey Walnut Prawns Ive ever had.  And the delivery was incredibly fast.  Really nice people work there. Users/JoAnnaRich Jo Anna Rich

20050903 18:02:00 nbsp The BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT in davis hands down!!!  Great service! Great food! Users/WithoutNombre

20051014 19:17:40 nbsp Try the Singapore fried rice. I love this stuff. Users/MarioMeneses

20051014 19:24:58 nbsp Yeah, I have to agree.  This is a very good restaurant.  It has a mix of Americanized and authentic Chinese recipes, which makes it a good bet for people with different expectations of chinese food.  It would be better of they actually indicated which was which as some dishes could go either way!  But hey, its a great restaurant with very interesting decor.  Its half stripmall, and half glamourrestaurant with ornate tables and chandeliers.  Very good service. Users/JaimeRaba

20051021 15:29:04 nbsp The honey walnut prawns are the best they put pineapple with them. Users/MyaBrn

20051229 21:32:22 nbsp The honey walnut prawns are actually called Vanilla Prawns with Glazed Walnuts, but very strongly resemble typical honey walnut prawns, with the addition of those pineapples.  Mmmmm.  Also had the pork with string beans, nice and spicy.  Note: a small soup makes nearly SIX personal bowls.  I cant imagine how many the large  makes.  Will definitely be visiting the House of Chang again. Users/AlexWright

20060220 02:20:49 nbsp The house special fried rice with shrimp, beef, and chicken is cheap and tasty here.  Same goes for the general chicken. Users/CurtisLim

20060305 19:59:24 nbsp Oh...so awful.  So so awful!  Cold soup, cold tea, $1.50 for a can of soda (!), eggplant with garlic sauce fried with LARD chunks.  Astounding, astonishingly awful.  And whoever said that they had authentic Chinese...shudder You stinky liar, I went there based off that comment!  As a Chinese/Viet person, I strongly recommend NOT going here. Users/QuynhNhuNguyen

  Well, the (allegedly) stinky liar looks to be rather white, so he might not know authentic chinese food if it plunged down his throat. However, Im sure he meant no harm. Users/KaiTing Kai
  So where WOULD be a good place to get decent Chinese in Davis? Anywhere? I know where to go in Milpitas, but thats a bit of a drive, and Davis Chinese places all seem to be quite highly Americanized. Users/EricKlein
  I love House of Chang and never had any problems with them.  You can try Davis Noodle City.  Any food on there is good.  And the portions are huge.  It will feed two people. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060326 10:32:56 nbsp The food here is indeed delicious; even their steamed rice is tasty when sampled plain.  A dinner for two persons easily feeds four: bring the rest home and feast again another day!  Service was also excellent on my visit: attentive, but not overly so.  Users/ErikAnderson

20060421 14:06:32 nbsp Theyve jacked up their prices since Im guessing a year ago (my roommate has an old menu).  Delivery was really fast.  I ordered the Fried Tofu, Hunan Triple, and Potstickers, all of which were delicious (for Americanized Chinese food, so I keep my expectations low) but the Hunan Triple should not have been more than $9.  I like that the dishes marked spicy were actually spicy.  I was suspicious of the fortune cookies since they did not come packaged in plastic yes, the fortune cookies were free to mingle with the flavors of everything else in the bag.  If I do order again from House of Chang, Ill try the Singapore fried rice Im Singaporean, and Im curious about what it is about the fried rice that makes it Singaporean.  :P Users/JennaChan

20060504 18:12:22 nbsp Food is OK, for South Davis anyway. One tip: when ordering to go and you are in a rush, dont order the potstickers. I have done so a couple of times and each time it seems to add about 20 minutes to the order, compared to the previous occasions. Users/RayValdes

20060707 13:39:39 nbsp The experiences we have had here have been consistantly good. Because our family in Sac likes it so much, we order a large amount a couple hours ahead and pick it up on our way out of town. The food has always been ready on time hot, fresh and packed nicely in a big box for us! Users/MyaBrn

20060716 09:10:19 nbsp when i went here i thought the food wasnt that good.  the sauce on the sesame chicken was way too sweet, and the garlic sauce was kind of bland and greesy.  i was disapointed.  maybe its because the dishes they offer on their lunch specials arnt as good, compared to the ones they offer a la carte, but if this is so, they should put some good ones on the lunch menu anyways.  overall i think that davis noodle city, Shanghai Town, and noodle express offer better tasting chinese food. Users/MattHh

20060916 21:27:47 nbsp Had the Mu Shu Pork and it was the best Ive had.  And the employees were extremelt nice! Users/MattSpear

20061005 12:33:36 nbsp I moved to Davis after living in SF for 18 years, and despaired of finding a good Chinese restaurant. House of Chang wouldnt be on my list of faves if it were in SF, but for Davis, its great. Fast, friendly service, much better than average food for Davis. Users/AngelBug

20070315 12:59:53 nbsp I dont think Davis has any true authentic Chinese restaurants.  But hey, I cannot complain about House of Changs for a quick lunch..friendly employees, fast service, and decently priced Users/DonaldJaye

20070612 16:58:49 nbsp House of Chang is definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. The owner is a real nice guy, the food is great, and the service is fantastic. Users/SamWard

20070817 19:00:27 nbsp the wonton soup is really good, neone kno the difference between wonton soup and wor wonton soup? Users/aether

20070927 23:22:47 nbsp The Wor Wonton soup has shrimp and more meat in it (less lettuce), and the Wonton soup has no shrimp, less meat, more lettuce.  I prefer the Wonton soup. Users/AndreaPasiliao

20070930 16:45:34 nbsp It was okay. Delivery was fast and prices were fair.
The food lacked flavor and texture.  Users/maymay

20071017 21:48:34 nbsp Delivery option is AWESOME. I wouldnt say its the best chinese restaurant in Davis, I like Shangri La better (authentic Chinese food buffet is not the best though) I had the beef chow fun and Happy Family there. They were both OK, the beef chow fun from Old Tea house is way better. The Happy Family is good, although there wasnt very much seafood in it. Overall, good place to get delivery from. Not very authentic though. I suggest Shangri La, Old Tea House, or Hometown Chinese Food (by the gas station). But those places dont do delivery! Users/Jeanne

20071017 22:22:14 nbsp The Singapore Chow Mei Fun makes a great lunch, and the owner is a really nice guy. Users/DonShor

20071020 14:24:10 nbsp I kinda got burned at this place. All of the menus and advertising literature claim that they serve their lunch specials ($5$6) Monday through Saturday 113. I went on a Saturday specifically for this reason, because not many Chinese restaurants have weekend specials. When I attempted to order, however, I was informed that lunch specials are only served Monday through Friday. I was hungry and didnt want to walk out, so I ordered their combination plate for $8. It was OK, although most of the plate was steamed rice, with the meat items being a little skimpy and bland. Considering that I was the only person in the entire restaurant, service was a bit inattentive. I dont think I will go back; I recomend Hunan or Jade Garden instead. Users/RyanCoates

20071023 14:14:27 nbsp Its good. I like the mu shu chicken. The inside looks fancy, but I have never felt uncomfortable in jeans and a sweatshirt there.   Users/HappyGilmore

20071028 18:50:13 nbsp Having ordered three different entrees from House of Chang I was expecting to taste the full spectrum that this restaurant should have had to offer, however according to the menu the Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef were supposed to be spicy.  Both had almost no detectable spice only hinting at what was promised by the menu.  The Vegtable Chow Mein was slightly mushy suggesting it was overcooked.  The Double Mushroom chicken was not as disappointing as the other entrees, but it could have included more chicken.  If youre not expecting a kick from your chineese food go ahead and try it, but if youre expecting spice dont. Users/Williamo123
     20071028 20:37:23 nbsp If you want extra spice, ask for it. My son does that all the time and they readily accommodate him.  Users/DonShor

20071031 20:24:56 nbsp Ive tried several of the Chinese places in town and the food was better quality than most. The restaurant was packed when I went, which is a good sign.  Users/ErinS

20071103 20:27:03 nbsp I really liked my experience here, the service was fast and the overall atmosphere was very homey.   Users/GregWebb

20071129 19:27:26 nbsp I just called to place an order for delivery and the lady was like, okay hurry up and I ordered but I think it was just a language barrier thing because she was pretty nice but totally rushed me.  She took my order and then said that shed call me back to get my address!  If she calls me back promptly and they deliver quickly and the food is good then thats all that matters I guess. Users/dvntboy

20071219 20:12:59 nbsp Good service? Nice staff? Good food? Yeah right. Service was rubbish, the staff was nasty, and the food even nastier. EWW! EWW! EWW! Lets just say they never found their tip... Users/thelonepiper555

20080110 18:45:33 nbsp Id say one of the better Chinese restaurants in town... I think I like Jade Garden better; however, for cheap and fast delivery, House of Chang cant be beat ) Users/CalvinCheng

20080114 20:42:50 nbsp I ordered the spicy eggplant and the hot & sour soup, and I couldnt stomach it.  Its so heavy and greasy that I had to throw it out.  Its pretty sad considering I paid almost $20 for it.
On the plus side, the delivery was extremely fast.  He said it would take 40 minutes, but he was at my house in 20. Users/hokusman

20080130 20:06:17 nbsp Very disappointed!! The customer service is horrible.  The woman who took my order hung up on me before asking for my address or telling me how long for delivery.  I called back to make sure we didnt get disconnected and she told me that she hung up because they were busy but she was going to call me back later. Again, hangs up on me. It wouldve been really nice to have been told that rather than being hung up on.

Second, the food isnt bad even though its in no way authentic. However, I order the Kung Pao chicken and the box was only halfway full!!!
There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants in Davis so I wont be ordering from here again. Users/KyleWilliams

20080206 10:18:52 nbsp the pot stickers are home made and excellent, the sauce they come with is very good too. Users/DagonJones

20080320 15:56:07 nbsp The place really rocks.  Me and my roomate who is Vietnamese/Chinese and approves of this Chinese food order from here almost every two weeks. We get the chicken and corn mashed soup, some vegetable dishes, I even got mushu here. I think the food here is pretty great and cheap, and the service is super super super nice. One time I didnt have enough money when I went to pick up the delivery outside, but the guy was like its ok. He is so nice. Also my friend went to eat at their restaurant and she got a major discount on the food, when she only had a ten, and the lady said it was ok, Ill just mark off the price. These people are really nice. I think just cause their great service you should go here. Its so yummy I want some soup. Users/PShah

20080518 00:39:12 nbsp The fastest delivery youll ever have, the bestpriced Chinese food in Davis. They never skimp on the vegetables, meat, or seafood in a dish, unlike some other restaurants in Davis. The taste is very authentic as well, if a tad bit on the oily side (but thats pretty normal for some Chinese cuisines). Really, really, really good. I only order Chinese from House of Chang.

P.S. Im Chinese and Im picky. Users/eda

20080727 13:06:53 nbsp My family and I have been coming here for years. Were on fairly friendly terms with most of the servers, who recognize us on sight and always say hello. Our family of five generally comes in later in the evening, towards closing time, and still service never dips below excellent. We usually order a wide variety of dishes (each picking one) and take home the leftovers for lunch the next day. Some of our favorites: House Fried Rice, House Chow Mein, Vanilla Shrimp, Mu Shu Pork, and all of their soups. Their Hot & Sour soup is one of my favorite soups ever, and I dont even like spicy food!

Their lunch specials are equally good, and I really enjoy going there to catch up with a friend. Service is fast, theres a ton of food (at least two meals for me), and even when busy the restaurant is quiet enough for good conversation to occur. On days when my family is too lazy to go out for dinner, the delivery service has always been a good experience as well. One thing to keep in mind about ordering for delivery, though: they are a small, familyowned place and when things are slow at the restaurant, they may not have a spare waiter around to deliver the food. Ive never had this happen personally, but a coworker was unfortunate enough to call during one such time.

Overall, this place is a great value and a wonderful atmosphere. And about the whole authenticity thing.... most American restaurants are Americanized anyway, but good food is still good food. Users/Anja

20081006 18:07:58 nbsp house fried rice, YUMMMMMM !!  very fast service also.  Users/SaraTarro

20081224 21:16:01 nbsp I always stick to the Combination Plate! Orange chicken is soo fresh & crispy hot, but the meat is kinda cut into chunky pieces. The beef and broccoli is nice for a healthy choice and you get plenty of rice, and veggies and a eggroll!  Users/MissAmyQ

20090315 10:35:43 nbsp One of my biggest peeves is how often people complain about food because its Americanized or not authentic. Who cares? Great food is great food.
Ive been going to House of Chang for years with my family and on my own. Its my goto whenever Im starving at work late in the evening or if Ive got a bunch of hungry friends. Its one of those places where the more you order, the more you swear they knock off the price, even for delivery.
The staff is super friendly, and not just because Im a regular. The food is great and they give you lots of it (which is a big deal for big eaters like me). My best friend (a vegetarian) and I will drop in and order 4 or 5 dishes, which is way more than we can eat at once, and our bill comes out around $30. This always, ALWAYS includes the vanilla walnut shrimp, which my friend was sooooo leery of at first, but the look on her face when I finally convinced her to try it? Priceless.
Some other great things on the menu...
House chow mein and fried rice. Theyre loaded.
Lemon chicken
Sweet and sour pork (yes these are all kinda standard, but one thing I like is that when you have them delivered, the sauce is on the side so the fried meat doesnt get soggy)
Wonton soup. When delivered the large comes in two huge styrofoam containers. Their soups are some of the best things ever when youre sick. Add steamed rice to bulk them up and youre good to go!
Fried bean curd with vegetable... the sauce is addictive and the texture is somehow very satisfyingly...munchy? Good.

Anyway, definitely a keeper for me. Users/KBathory

20090413 21:44:58 nbsp good food Users/strawberry

20090515 20:13:59 nbsp one time i had lunch here, the decided to clean out their supply closet. they pulled out a shopping cart FULL of canned food. very embarrassing for them... they said sorry though.  Users/julpham

20090906 00:41:44 nbsp I got delivery a few nights ago. Honey/vanilla shrimp with prawns, hunan beef, and orange beef. They delivered the food really fast, which is nice. The honey shrimp is really good, I used to always go to ding how for that but its basically the same and 3 bucks cheaper here. The only thing I didnt like was that the orange beef was too sweet for my taste, think kettle corn but a bit sweeter. But the hunan beef was really tasty.  Users/alyssap

20090918 20:33:25 nbsp I miss east coast 24 hour Chinese delivery.  Sadly this is one of only two places in Davis that delivers.  They stop earlier than Great Wall II (Delivery until 8:30/9 for HoC  9:30 from Great Wall) but the service seems to be much better.  I dont know that its the best place in town but its the place I call when Im stuck at home and have a hankering for mushu or when Im sick and in desperate need of hot and sour soup. Plus they are fast, my last delivery took 20 minutes from phone call to doorstep and the guy who drops off the food is really polite.  Users/OliviaY

20091011 11:51:00 nbsp By far the best Chinese food restaurant in Davis.  Its americanized, yes, but its great.  Justin, the ownerwaiter is about the coolest guy in town. Users/shiwalogo

20091105 20:47:19 nbsp Chang Is my favorite Chinese Place in Davis. The guy always gets our order correct and delivers it VERY fast. Good food and a great solution if u want to order for delivery but dont want pizza. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Great Mushu Pork and Hot Garlic Chicken Users/Buddmann31

20091123 19:12:32 nbsp This place is gross. Im from San Francisco and maybe Im accustomed to being spoiled by declicious Chinese food.. but the six dishes I ordered tasted horrible, with the exception of the sweet & sour pork... But then again, few people can get that wrong.  I brought my parents here which was a huge mistake. They say Jade Garden is better. The waitress is really nice though. Users/ElizabethLee

20100209 21:19:45 nbsp The potstickers here are INCREDIBLE.  I have been here many times but the only thing I remember are those yummy potstickers. They come with a fantastic dipping sauce. Try them and you will not be disappointed. Users/DagonJones

20100410 18:59:34 nbsp I read the reviews here first so I ordered to go. It was here fast, but was really bad. Heat and serve food. No flavor. Dont wast your money. The Nugget Market has far superior Chinese food and its a grocery store. Sorry, but its the truth. Users/LanceManion

20100422 18:41:37 nbsp LOVE THAT HEY DILVER Users/Meagen.L.Chaffin

20100614 05:18:00 nbsp Came here for dinner last week. They have very nice interior spacing and decent tables/decor etc. The waiter was really nice as well. The food? not so much. We ordered seafood soup and a plate of mixed seafood and veggies. The crab meat in both items were imitation and the they both lacked flavors. The Veggies were way over cooked and started to almost melt in your mouth. Some things you just have to try once and never again. Users/C.Ling

20100717 18:24:27 nbsp I usually order their food for delivery here and its always been pretty fast. Today was ridiculous. My phone shows that I made the call at 6:06PM and the food got here by 6:22PM and I live in North Davis. Pretty awesome. Users/hankim

20110124 22:54:12 nbsp They make the best fried rice! Justin is super quick with deliveries! He is the man! Users/kobe24

20110130 11:41:45 nbsp I was scared to order Chinese delivery because all the places seem to have bad reviews, but then I remembered that people just like to complain on the internet.  I ordered Singapore Fried Rice, Eggrolls, and Generals Chicken.  The food was fantastic!  All of the food actually had flavor, it wasnt too greasy, and the Singapore Fried Rice was surprisingly spicy. Users/miguelsantiago

20110216 08:59:50 nbsp Amazing! Great service, lots of food, just wonderful! Users/Mogitha

20110329 14:48:23 nbsp I really like their lemon chicken it tastes like lemons were actually involved in the making of the sauce! My favorite thing about it is that it captures the sweet, sour, and bitter lemon flavors. The food is also ready surprisingly fast for pick up. Users/DanielleC

20110524 22:20:44 nbsp My boyfriend loves the Singapore Chow Mei Fun.  Its killer! Users/SharonLee

20110718 18:31:35 nbsp I never tried this place before, but I ordered from it last night after reading reviews.  I ordered Hunan Beef, Bean Curd with Veggies, and a large order of Hot and Sour soup.  I also got a side of white rice.  The Hunan Beef wasnt very spicy, but it wasnt bad.  The tofu was good.  The real star was the Hot and Sour soup, and the large order looks to be two small orders, so it was a great deal, and it was delicious!  Ill probably order from here again. Users/KurtSassenrath

20110727 17:05:50 nbsp I LOVE THIS PLACE! I order from it almost every week. I really like their chow mein and potstickers. Their General Chicken is really good too. I try something new everytime I order and I have yet to be disappointed. Plus they are cheaper than the other chinese place that delivers and they deliver fast. Highly recommend for delivery. Users/hbtisell

20111216 16:59:53 nbsp Great food! Users/JeffA

20120216 17:45:57 nbsp Great food and prompt delivery!  We had the general chicken, singapore chow mei fun, singapore fried rice, and hot and sour soup.  Very tasty :)   Users/miguelsantiago

20120320 16:22:54 nbsp good food, fast service. BUT the sweet and sour soup is absolutely disgusting. it is beyond me why they give that as a soup.  its one of the most sourest soups ive ever had.  i love mostly anything else on their menu, and i love how fast they bring the food. but you just have to get rid of that soup. like burn the recipe. and make something else. but hey, what do i know. maybe thats authentic chinese Sweet and Sour Soup and im just unfamiliar with it. who knows. Users/halfhiphop

20120923 11:41:58 nbsp Its called Hot and Sour soup. It has an acquired taste but they shouldnt destroy it. Some recipes are different and I do like others than most. You can ask them to serve you egg flower soup or wonton soup instead of the hot and sour soup. Let them know you dont prefer the spicy soup. I hope Im right that you are talking about the dark brown with tofu soup and not the sweet and sour red dip that is definitely NOT soup.Users/GeeForce


20120623 14:12:42 nbsp My family of four went for lunch today (a Saturday), partly based on reviews here. We were the only people in the restaurant, but the wait person still managed to ignore us. I had to walk across the room to tell her we were ready to order, again to ask for hot sauce, and even for water refills. The feeling that we were invisible was only reinforced when she started running the carpet sweeper next to our table. Then she dropped off the check when we were only halfway done eating. The food was, at best, mediocre. Ill definitely be spending my dining dollars elsewhere in the future. Users/RobWestergaard

20121004 18:55:15 nbsp I have been to this place in the past and the waiters were friendly, however the last time I went they could not have been less friendly, I was really taken back by it, I dont plan on ever going back to this place and most certainly will not recommend it to my friends. I am not sure If I just caught them on a bad day or what, but there were no other customers in there, now I know why. Users/Letian

20130316 11:54:28 nbsp Fantastic Chinese food. The food was delicious, the prices were reasonable, and the service was very good. I am by no means a connoisseur of Chinese food, but this was by far the best Ive had in Davis. The egg rolls were nice and hot, crispy, and actually had some meat in them; the beef and broccoli had a delicious sauce; and the orange chicken gave me a whole new perspective on the dish (i.e., it was more of a brown color and actually tasted like oranges as opposed to the version I usually see that is neon orange and just tastes like sugar and oil). Anyway, dinner on Friday was my first time here, and its safe to say Ill be going back frequently! Users/AlexPerkins

20130516 17:11:35 nbsp What happened to the menu?  There used to be a link on this page to the menu... Users/ToddGreen
