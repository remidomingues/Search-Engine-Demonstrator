Houseboats refers to the much anticipated (by some) Fraternities Greek Sororities communitys annual houseboating trip during Memorial Day weekend. Quite possibly the most insane, fun, exciting, AMAZING weekend ever is when thousands of college kids gather at Lake Shasta for 4 days and 3 nights of complete drunken debauchery.  However, houseboating is not restricted to that weekend alone  getting a group together and renting out one, two, or even three houseboats can be an amazing time, too. The University Covenant Church youth groups also go houseboating on Lake Shasta, probably with slightly different activities.

Note: Houseboats is a universitysanctioned or sponsored event due to ASUCD support of a houseboat dedicated to maintaining the safety of all occupants of the lake during the weekend by means of a combination of Club Finance Council funding and a lineitem in the grants budget. Since the student government does pay for paramedics to troll the lake with water, condoms, sun screen, and granola bars, and ASUCD is an element of Student Affairs, the university does defacto sponsor Houseboats.

RESPONSE FROM UC DAVIS MAY 2014: http://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/lettertostudents592014.pdf In an open letter to students, officials in Student Affairs issued a travel advisory in advance of the Memorial Day weekend. “We are aware that students from a variety of local universities travel to Lake Shasta each Memorial Day weekend to participate in house boating activities. While many groups from UC Davis attend, this event is not sanctioned or sponsored by UC Davis. Over the years, students have suffered injuries and a few students have died due to accidents associated with this event. In addition, the Lake Shasta area is generally out of cell range service, making it difficult to obtain medical assistance when needed. We encourage all students to consider the risks associated with attending this event.” The administrators urged students to make informed decisions, and pointed to these relevant resources: http://www.co.shasta.ca.us/index/sheriff_index/divisions/boating_safety.aspx Lake Shasta Boating Safety and http://safeparty.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis’ Safe Party website . “Every Aggie matters and we encourage you to enjoy your holiday weekend in a responsible manner.  On behalf of the university, Student Affairs and ASUCD, we wish you a safe Memorial Day weekend.”

Also the reason so many girls and boys fill the ARC in May is with hopes of achieving their ideal Houseboatready bod. Girls are in bikinis the entire time so preparations must be made months in advance.

Apparently if you dont have a near death experience while house boating (i.e. passing out in an innertube and falling off, only to be noticed by another reviler who dives in and saves you, or misjudging the hop from houseboat to houseboat and crack your head etc) you are doing it wrong (or at least that is the mentality it seems everyone has, I myself have never been)  Users/StevenDaubert

 Safeboats and Criticism 

Death was fairly common, given the most excellent combination of alcohol + water + party atmosphere.  Since at least one reveler dies every year (not always from Davis), providing a safe boat has been a campaign goal of student government officers for a while. This goal was accomplished in 2008, with ASUCD and Onsite Medical Service creating the first Safe Boat. The program has been run every year since. This has caused some controversy because the University doesnt want to assume Epic Quad Battle legal liability for drunk people. Thanks, Risk Management Services Risk Management!

Many students are also upset because they dont think the undergraduate student fees money they pay to go to this school should be used to enable irresponsible behavior by a greek life small portion of the student body. For those who worked hard in high school and dreamt of going to a good university, full of mature and intellectual people, Houseboats can be seen as a huge middle finger. It is the biggest manifestation of the YOLO, plastic, ignorant bro parties party scene that sadly has a presence on this campus. Indeed, it can feel like deception to find out college is full of the same people you detested in high school: void of intellectual curiosity but full of discrimination and judgment of those who do not strive to be like them, and anyone who does not fit into a view of the world as a porn set comprised of Barbie and Ken dolls.

http://theaggie.org/article/2011/05/26/partyingsafelyathouseboats2011 According to the Aggie, ASUCD has funded the safeboat since 2008 through a mix of ASUCD funds and fundraising specifically for safeboats. In 2011, the safeboat cost ASUCD $5500. It provides free medical services 24/7, water, condoms, and granola bars.  OnSite Medical Service also donates thousands of dollars to this cause by subsidizing over $15,000 in medical costs, providing 1012 EMTs and Paramedics, medical equipment (including safety blankets, first aid, and trauma management), as well as advanced medical direction throughout the entire weekend at no cost to their patients.  OMS provides the Safe in SafeBoats and they are proud to be a part of this ASUCD initiative.

In 2012 the safeboat was only given $500 from ASUCD directly, leading to a heated argument during one of the budget hearings.  During the hearings one senator said they thought it would be unfair to expect the people who go to Houseboats to pay an extra dollar or two to ensure their safety.
   Scumbag ASUCD senator: People spend a bunch of money to rent boats and buy alcohol. Doesnt think its fair for them to pay a little bit more to ensure their own safety. Users/hankim
   Pay for booze and party supplies; think student government should pay for safeboats so they dont kill themselves. Bro logic.

Although its a wonderful time, I must say that houseboats is EXTREMELY dangerous.  Im not talking about sexual assault or fighting.  The potential for serious injury or death is simply astounding.  I almost died last year when I was really drunk and sleep deprived, tried to climb down the top of my boat, and ended up falling off the side and hitting my throat against the steel railing around the lower deck.  Fortunately, I hit the soft spot between my chin and adams apple, but I narrowly missed crushing my windpipe or breaking my jaw.  Another silver lining to this story is the fact that I hit the rail rather than fall into the piss/beer/reservoir water stew that surrounds the island we were docked at.  I have many more gruesome stories, but Ill let someone else take over.


Ditto on the weekend being hands down the best weekend ever. My near death experience came when I apparently decided it would be a good idea to bring some beer on an inner tube and just float. Well I kind of started passing out and luckily some people on my boat saw that I was slowly sinking through the middle of the tube on my way to the bottom of the lake and they lassoed me in. Thanks guys. Also a guy on our boat passed out and fell through the top floor hole to the kitchen while we were playing our 6 a.m. Souza game.


Haha I think I heard about the guy falling through the hole on your boat JJ. I obtained the houseboat nickname of floater because I too thought it would be a fantastic idea to bring beer on an inter tube and just float all weekend (its genius, except when you pass out haha). I heart houseboats because you basically get to party hop all weekend but instead of a DD all you need is a flotation device! I did manage to find the Aphi senior boat and order them to chief me and wake up with permanent marker all over my body with no clue why, ruin 70% of my houseboats clothes (aka everything besides my bikini), play more rounds of 711 doubles than ive ever played in my life, pass out every night by 8pm, lose my boat 10 times and have a random guy escort me back each time, and not remember a good solid portion of Saturday afternoon. My near death experience happened when I was straddling a log and just toppled over into the water. Luckily someone saw me and was able to sit me upright again.
  There was a Saturday that weekend? Hmmmmmmmmm


Dateline Houseboats 2005:

Another Ore. student dies at Lake Shasta

02:52 PM PDT on Monday, May 30, 2005

By kgw.com and KMTR Staff

LAKE SHASTA, Calif.  Another Oregon university student has died while on an outing to Lake Shasta.

University of Oregon Student Joel Meyer, 21, of Sisters, Ore., drowned after hitting his head in a fall from a houseboat moored at Lake Shastas Slaughterhouse Island, Shasta County deputies said.

The accident happened about 4:30 Sunday afternoon. Meyer was pulled from the water by other students with diving gear who were staying on the island. He was taken by helicopter to Shasta Regional Medical Center in wiki:Redding where he was pronounced dead.BR

Im sure you would have seen the AIRMED helicopter land on the island Sunday Afternoon, assuming you werent allready passed out!!


20061108 17:06:48 nbsp I saw some peeps loading up at Aggie liquor Aggie for housebots, 14 kegs... Users/StevenDaubert

20080520 20:32:16 nbsp Im surprised more people from Chico dont make the trip. My first trip was in 07 and only because my friends are redding locals, so we went on a couple of aluminum boats and camped a little bit away from slaughterhouse. The very first night walking around on the shore i managed to sprain my ankle ... but i kept it real and hobbled around all weekend.

Virtually everyone who has died as a result of houseboating has done so soley due to their own stupidity / overintoxication Users/slammin211s

20100529 01:45:16 nbsp im really lost on houseboats in terms of what exactly goes on...can someone help me out? Users/davisrox

20100529 08:21:25 nbsp I went last year what follows is a synopsis of day 1:

Arrive Friday 10 AM ish, get on boat, back out of dock land across from dock and load kegs. Begin drinking. Boat out to Slaughterhouse island, continue drinking, land there wander around on other folks boats drinking until until you, a: find a member of the opposite sex to pair up with or b: pass out / black out / fight with other sexually unsatisfied males. By now its 7 PM. Rally around midnight and drink a bit more before going to bed 2 to 4 AM ish. Get up around 67AM, either get on your boat or hang out with your new friends boat because everyone leaves the island to return to the docks to pick up their buddies around 10 AM Sat. Then the whole process begins again...

Days two and three were quite hazy but consisted of much the same as above. Monday is essentially a cleaning day. Most everyones out of booze and the boats all need to be as spotless and intact as possible to avoid the loss of the rental deposit. People who flake here wont be invited back. Dont be a flake.

I did this once and though much fun was had it was so ridiculous that I dont feel like risking my life again.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20100602 02:07:22 nbsp Im an EMT who worked on the Safeboat this past weekend. Why Slaughterhouse Island was chosen as the party site I have no idea. The water was also much higher than normal this year, so the 212 houseboats (187 of which contained college students) had to try and cram on a smaller island than usual instead of on the wide beach that is normally there.

Overall, we had at least 200 patients. The first day was relatively calm, but the majority of our patient load was on Saturday and Sunday. We had 8 EMTs stationed on the Safeboat, and we were meant to switch between teams of 4 on six or threehour shifts. Lets just say that from noon to 6PM on Saturday, all 8 of us were on duty nonstop. Although it felt good to help people out, Im glad the Safeboat is needed only once a year. Users/JonathanSheu

  I have no idea what youre even trying to argue, but the ASUCD is spending everyones money to promote safety to a very small percentage of students who want to go out and do stupid things on their own while a police department is paid to keep everyone safe by preventing crimes (although some might debate what they actually do)http://i.imgur.com/rwSx4.jpg .

  good fucking god reading that makes me so incensed

20110602 13:10:20 nbsp Safeboat provides a lot of benefit at a relatively low cost to ASUCD (most of the money comes from fundraising or donations from other orgs). Plus, most of your tuition money goes to things that the average student gets no direct benefit from anyway, so Ive never understood why people single out safeboat as wasteful or specialinterest spending. Even if we assume that all the funding came from ASUCD money, with 25k or so undergrads that comes out to like 22 cents a person. In reality, if you include CFC financing, I think ASUCD pays for roughly half the cost, thought thats more of an educated guess (so dont quote me). In conclusion, safeboat provides a great service, that while its not utilized by everybody, does save lives, and thats worth 1020 cents of my tuition every year. Users/DylanSchaefer
  To be fair, Han isnt singling out Safeboat.  Hes pretty rabid about all ASUCD spending, including things like the (now defunct) ASPAPERS, trying to ferret out hidden funding and other uses of student funds. jw
  most of your tuition money goes to things that the average student gets no direct benefit from anyway  exactly what my complaint is. This should not happen. I had to work my ass off and put myself in debt to pay for programs that did not contribute to the educational or research missions of the university. You make the mistake of thinking that critics of the safeboats program are just against this particular handout to the Greek community. No, this is just one of the more ridiculous examples of student funds being used to enable irresponsibility. I think most critics would say abolish the CFC and most of ASUCD, too.Users/WilliamLewis
  You dont see anything wrong with the fact that most of our tuition money goes to things that the average student gets no direct benefit from? It may take me a little over a minute to earn those twentytwo cents, but why should that money be spent on condoms for frat boys? Also, what major benefits are there from keeping idiots alive? And of course you happen to be a member of the frat with the first UC Davis student to die of alcohol poisoning in about a century. Users/hankim
  Exactly my point you arent really against safeboat, youre against any use of your money that doesnt benefit you directly. Which makes safeboat somewhat of an odd target in my opinion, a) because it uses relatively little student funds and b) it saves lives (even if it apparently is lives that are less worthy that yours, han). And I dont like my fees being spent on abnormally large salaries for an overly large administration or on rebuilding the campus every 5 years or so, but I do support things like safeboat, even though I have never used it. Also, Im not sure what youre trying to insinuate by bringing my fraternity into this, but for the record, Phi Delta Theta is a different iteration of the one that existed when that guy died, he did not die at a fraternity event, and PDT is an alcoholfree fraternity now.
    People are out there purposely putting their lives in danger to have fun. Why should other students pay for something like that? Its the principle of the thing and that money could be better used somewhere else. And at least pretty much anyone going to the school uses the buildings. Users/hankim
      Its a fair enough point. I think a couple thousand bucks for saving lives is worth my student fees, even if the people that need saving are knowingly risking their health in the first place. But I suppose we have different philosophies and well have to agree to disagree.
             @ hankim  Because thats what you do in a decent society  you take care of people.  Users/Darkfallin
               Taking care of people is fine, but when you use the money paid by students, who expect their money to go towards their education, and pay for the safety of a small minority of people who deliberately put themselves in risky situations for the sake of fun, that is not fine. Users/hankim
                So you also oppose the use of ASUCD funds to support Tipsy Taxi? Users/jsogul
                      Han is a fiscal conservative he opposes everything Daubert
                        What Daubert said. If you like to go out and get wasted, do it on your own dime. All the students who are too busy to go out drinking all the time because they have jobs or would prefer to do other activities shouldnt be paying for those who enjoy partying. If anything, its practically welfare for those who can afford to spend most of their nights partying. Users/hankim
                           Tipsy Taxi saves the lives of other drivers who would be on the road/sidewalks at the same time as those drunk drivers, Safeboats helps those who willingly put themselves at risk.
                             Those people should be paying for taxis or getting designated drivers instead of having us subsidize their fun. Pay for our rides home or were going to kill someone on our way home should not be an acceptable method to get fun subsidized.  Users/hankim
                                I sort of agree. The only exception should be if the students can prove with receipts that they got drunk off of Aggie Lager. In those cases, UCD should foot the taxi bill.  Users/ScottMeehleib


20120531 05:57:30 nbsp Hypothetical Question:
Im planning on throwing this HUGE Caravan Party where well be renting a bunch of RVs and driving to and from SoCal. Itll be a weekend long event full of booze, fun, and DANGER. Well be jumping off from RV to RV... DRUNK.  The chances of there being a fatal accident will be VERY HIGH. This weekend long event will contribute absolutely NOTHING to Academia BUT its open to ALL STUDENTS (although its clear and implicit target audience is the Q/PoC community). Should ASUCD fund a SAFERV for this revelry?  Users/Yadannn
  No, ASUCD should make a phone call to the CHP because youve basically just admitted to drunk driving.  Hypothetically speaking, of course.  Users/BrentLaabs

Damn right Im PISSED. I dont want a single cent of the money I pay to go here to fund these idiots who dont even deserve be going to UC Davis anyway. If you pay for all this crap, you can pay for your own safety. Oh, but its not just safeboats, we also have to pay for your freaking condoms and granola bars!
