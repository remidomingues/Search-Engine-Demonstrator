The Household Hacker is the pseudonym of a guy who creates amazing electrical achievements with mundane ingredients, such as:

  How to charge an iPod with an onion. http://www.youtube.com/watch?vGfPJeDssBOM Video
  How to power a TV with a AAA battery. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v0rAzhTJuFU Video
  How to make a highdefinition speaker with a paper plate, aluminum foil, and a penny. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v8m8fbnShPcw Video

These videos are in the style of http://youtube.com/results?search_querydiy&searchSearch tons of other DIY videos on the web.

These absolutely work (http://www.pcplanets.com/videoyoutubeCharginganiPodwithanonionwillnotwork.46ezmOMQnzw.shtml explanation), Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion in the same vein as Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies other Really Real things.  After building some of the items listed on the site, you might also be interested in Magic Items of Davis similar Really Real items.

The Household Hacker, according to some of his websites, is from Davis, CA, although some of his other websites state he lives in Georgia, or San Francisco. According to the IP address of http://www.inoculatedmind.com/2007/11/19/mondaymadnesshouseholdhacker/ a comment left on Users/KarlMogel Karl Mogels blog, the Household Hacker logs on from a Comcast cable internet connection in Sacramento, which is consistent with living in Davis. (Davis Comcast connections show up as Sacramento when you search the IP.)

20071123 16:33:41 nbsp These experiments are so fake! None contain a single shred of truth! I mean come on, power a tv with a battery? Batteries and TVs run on opposite currents! One is AC and the other is DC! Make a hidef speaker with a paper plate? Speakers need magnets! Look it up! I cant believe how many people fall for this shit! Users/AceDecade
 These things may be fake, but AC and DC are not opposites. You can even think of DC as AC where the frequency is zero.  A disgruntled EE major.
        Oh come on, they are opposites in the obvious context of the OPs point, the most basic of terms. (AC alternates mag/direction, and DC is a constant) Sure, theyd technically be the same when the ACs sine wave for a moment is at the middle, but thats weak and you know it :P  Was it semantics you replied to? Maybe if he had said they run on opposite types of currents perhaps it would have been a better fit.
        When you are looking at things in the wiki:wikipedia:Laplace transform Laplace domain, AC and DC look the same. I wasnt referring to your suggestion that AC acts like DC momentarily (which only works for purely resistive loads in the steady state, anyway). 

 Ah, Ace....you use the penny and the foil to create the magnetic part of the speaker....the plate is just the sound horn (same tech as cheap regular speakers).   Users/RocksandDirt
