Howard IM Field is equipped with lights. One of the light towers was replaced in 2007 to include a cell phone towers cell phone tower for Verizon.

During the fall, the UC Davis football UCD football team practices regularly on this field. During football season, it is usually lined with two football fields. At other times of the year, the field is sometimes lined for other field sports. Occasionally during football season the California Aggie Marching Banduh Banduh practices here when their other practice sites are unavailable. Regardless of when said practice takes place, it is at that exact time that the sprinklers generally decide to turn on.

When football games were still held at Toomey Field, the associated pregame festivities typically took place here. The Aggie Pack entrance to Toomey Field also faced Howard IM Field.
