Dont be afraid of the Hugging guy. He is a mentally handicapped 20something year old man who hangs out around the MU and likes to hug people. Men and women alike. He isnt really creepy at all. He is just a friendly Town Characters town character. His real name is Tharren.


I encountered Hugging Guy down at Pita Pit in early December. It was around 1:30 to 2 a.m., so it was mostly the postbar crowd. He made the rounds giving everyone hugs. If I hadnt heard about him I might have been a little suspicious, but he was received surprisingly well by all the (confused and drunk) people he hugged. As stated, he wasnt creepy at all.. Just confusing. Good guy. Users/CaptainRush

Hugging Guy often shows up at Woodstocks Pizza where he does his normal rounds of hugs around the joint.. Does he ever buy anything? I see him eating but I think its just the hugees feeding him.  Quite a few people I know have played air hockey with him in the MU Games Area on numerous occasions. Oh man, and during Picnic Day Battle Of The Bands 2005, he was the jitteriest dude at Lake Spafford.. dancin while hugging... oodles of fun! Users/BenjaminCatabas
 This is mean. just the hugees feeding him? You make him sound like a dog. Users/NickSchmalenberger

haha.. Im sorry.. didnt mean to sound umm... mean.  But seriously... people offer him food.. he doesnt need to buy anything!!  Anyway, he doesnt hang out there as much anymore so...

Huggy Bears real name is Tharren (sp?).  I went to high school with him at JFK in Sacramento.  He just turned 30 years old.  I have heard (not verified) that his condition is due to severe physical abuse as a child.  He is actually very friendly, although he does seem to hug girls more than guys.  Hmm, maybe smarter than he seems.  Anyhow, dont mind the hugging.  Just tell him you love him and it will make him happier than you can imagine.  Users/JeffSpeckles






Tharren is totally radical.  I used to run Karaoke at G Street and hed come in every Monday to sing some songs.  I cant remember which ones were his favorite except one  Night Shift by The Commodores.  Hed ask me to sing with him and wed tear the place up.  Hes a real good guy  I need to make it back out and see how hes doing...   Users/DevinBruce Devin

What exactly does hugging guy look like? I go to SacState and theres a guy who hangs out in our Union who does the same thing! does he travel to various campuses to hug people??  Users/TojoAndrianarivo Tojo
  No, theyre all different. They come out of Hugging University. Users/SteveDavison

20060512 19:20:21 nbsp Hey Tojo, Tharren actually DOES seem to be in both places.  I know him well from Davis, but now I go to Sac State and I have seen him there a few times.  Hes spreading the love! Users/EmilyBlake

20060824 12:47:07 nbsp Tharren rocks, and hes fucking amazing at mario 3 on old school Nintendo. He does, however, have the worst BO of anyone Ive ever met. Ive let him crash on my couch a few times.  He lives in sacramento near sac state somewhere. He is definitely smarter than he seems. Tharren loves oatmeal and Dennys. The end. Users/DonovanKelley

20061219 19:23:15 nbsp His name is Tharren, however he is not in his 20s! He is definitely older as he has been around Davis since the midnineties before I ever got there. He once stayed at our place on 3rd street, because as you may have guessed he doesnt have a home in Davis. He does have a place to stay at some sort of halfway home in Sacramento but he purposely misses his bus and to stay in Davis and hangout with all the college kids. Often he sleeps on the street. Indeed he is harmless as you have stated however, dont buy the man a drink, he doesnt need one! And for the record, he is better than you think at Karaoke and has a legit 3point shot! Check yourself.

20061220 16:51:24 nbsp Yeah, Ive been seeing him around town for many years now Users/StevenDaubert

20071015 20:38:20 nbsp Yea, hes a cool guy! Users/kj

He lived on M Street for years with what I always assumed was his family.
