HughStimson is a former Davis resident who now lives in various places other than Davis, including that place and the other place even further away, but has a strange fascination for DavisWiki.  Occasionally he writes in it.  Currently he is a harbouring a plan to make NotDavisWiki.org, which may in the end be called http://victoriawiki.org.  If all goes well, it we be the same but not about Davis, but rather about some other place, where Hugh lives.

Far more information than you require about this subject is located at http://hughstimson.org.

Hugh misses his Davisite friends and says hi and often thinks about the goat cheese from the farmers market and that time when he left.
