The Human Powered Housing Project is a bike/RV contraption built and lived in by Brian Campbell. Its about fifteen feet long and is absolutely one of a kind. Brian rides around in style under a shade canopy while protected by a motorcycle like windshield. His house forms the back of the rig. It has windows, a slot for donations, a comfortable looking bed, shelves and everything else a normal person would want. When parked, the project sits on an incredibly sturdy kick stand because this is probably the heaviest bike that youve ever seen. Its made mostly out of materials that you can find at a hardware store. It looks like there are a lot of aluminum struts and foil tape. The back wheel is much larger than your average bike wheel but the front, while still homemade, looks more normal. The gear system is pretty beefy as well. This is at least the second Human Powered Housing Project to exist. Look below for a picture of an earlier prototype. Anyone know what this thing weighs?

Allegedly, he rents out his room for $10/night. Thats probably less than what youre paying for rent. Rooms? How many does it have? Has anyone ever done so?

http://bikeportland.org/2009/08/24/avisitfrommotorhomebikebuilderbriancampbell22672 Brian is now living in the Portland Oregon area.  He hasnt lived in Davis for a few years. My source, who was formerly a homeless street musician, now a bike builder, said that about five years ago he verified Brians riding when they both rode up Siskiyou Mountain Pass.

http://bullsheet.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/sleepingbiketrailers/ Sleeping bike trailers have been around for many years. There are others who live on their bike, in a http://www.bikeroute.com/michaelwashington/ different way.

On a related subject, Davis is world famous for its Bicycles humanpowered vehicles. There are many bikes that are WhymCycles unique to Davis.

 Questions 
Brian claims to be able to sustain 7080 mph on the vehicle.  He has told me how he does it, but I have not seen him go anywhere near that.  Anyone know for a fact whether it is possible, and if so, whether he actually does it? Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

  7080 mph?  Perhaps this may be the vehicles terminal velocity after being ridden off the edge of a cliff  ;)  More seriously, the top speed in a downhillcoast situation depends crucially on the vehicles wiki:wikipedia:drag coefficient (air friction).  And the more drag there is, the more weight becomes a factor (heavierfaster).  The Human Powered Housing Project is neither sleek nor heavy  I would not bet on it in a wiki:wikipedia:Soap Box Derby, but I would wager that in a windtunnel situation at 80mph, all that the foil tape you see would lose its grip on those foam panels!

  That is when his front cowcatcher gets caught on the rear bumper of an 18wheeler going down I5.
    Ive seen a childs car which goes that fast. The speedometer was painted on though...

Doesnt the rear cabin of this bike look a lot shorter now than when this bike originally appeared in Davis? I think it may have been recently truncated? Was there some sort of damage to the rear which was removed? It doesnt seem like a good nights sleep can be had in it now.Users/RickEle
