The http://www.city.davis.ca.us/meetings/agenda.cfm?c8 Human Relations Commission is one of the City of Davis citys City Commissions commissions that assists the City Council.

The Human Relations Commissions original mission statement said it was created to promote mutual respect, understanding and tolerance between all persons.

Revised in 2003, the mission statement now reads seeks to build a community in Davis where: relationships between diverse peoples are valued by all; the voices of the voiceless are heard; discrimination and hate are not tolerated, and citizens can address issues dealing with hatred, discrimination and alienation.

The function and purpose posted on the City of Davis website, states that the commission works to promote cohesiveness and understanding among the members of the community by advising the City Council on the development of programs related to mediating disputes, investigating complaints, hearing and preparing reports on discrimination of all kinds in the city.

The Human Relations Commission recommends recipients for the Citys annual Thong H. Huynh Awards.

In the mid1980s, in the wake of a fatal raciallymotivated stabbing at Davis Senior High School, the City created the Human Relations Commission.The Commission provides a forum for discussion of human relations issues, including ethnic and racial issues and civil rights. Representatives of the City, including liaisons from the City Council, the Davis police department and the city managers office, and often the City Manager and the Chief of Police themselves, have attended the Commissions monthly meetings. The ability of community members to discuss their concerns,in a setting away from the political spotlight of a Council meeting, provides new opportunities for communication and resolution.

While there is a youth representative from Davis Senior High School there are no undergraduate students undergraduate or graduate students graduate student representatives.

The HRCs mission and function has been questioned from time to time over the years. In 20052006, the commission responded to stories about possible police misconduct  Police misconduct stories  and recommended to the City Council that a police oversight commission be established.  The Council decided to go another route and created a 3member panel and an ombudsman to handle citizen complaints.

At the June 27th City Council meeting the council voted 41 (Greenwald voting no) to put the Commission on hiatus for two months, as well asked for the resignation of all of its current members. Council members cited a fractured community, a failure on the part of the HRC to work with each other or the council and an abandoned mission statement as reasons for the dismissal. The City Council has made it clear that there will be a Human Relations Commission come September 2006, after reevaluating its mission statement and tasks that it should be undertaking.  Though past commission members can reapply for appointment, former Chair, Cecelia Escamilla Greenwald, and Vice Chair, Diane Carlson, have stated that they will not be doing so.

As of September the Davis City Council was advised to reconstitute the Human Relations Commission, but the new commission is to avoid issues involving Davis Police oversight.  These issues are handled by the Davis Police Community Advisory Board instead.

The City Council reauthorized the Human Relations Commission in October of 2007 through http://www.cityofdavis.org/meetings/pdfs/Resolution_07125Human_Relations_Commission.pdf Resolution No. 07125.

The Davis Police Department has some real issues that adversely affect many young people in Davis. The Davis Police Department requires substantial oversight. The old Human Relations Commission was dead on in its effort to reign in an out of control police organization and they should be praised for that effort. The people who should have provided the leadership were the prior City Manager Jim Antonen (the DPD reports to the City Manager), the Mayor Ruth Asmundson and Larry Vanderhoef as UCD leader. All of the supposed leaders of Davis failed to take action despite knowing that action was needed  they failed the community.  Steve Hayes
