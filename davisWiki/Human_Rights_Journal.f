 Making the Case: Human Rights Journal at UC Davis 

Making the Case: Human Rights Journal at UC Davis is an interdisciplinary, Undergraduate journal that encourages students to make a case about human rights issues. Our inaugural issue was published January 2012. In it, contributors came from majors such as International Relations, Sociology, Political Science, Comparative Literature, Evolution & Ecology, Mathematics, History, Asian American Studies, and more.

Our goals are to stir up conversations, challenge views, and provoke students to think critically and ask questions. In addition, our journal explores human rights through creative and unique approaches, including but not limited to: Essays, Fiction, Poetry, Photography, Art, and Comics.

A special thanks to the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club. (Publication costs were underwritten by a generous grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club.)

Making the Case: Human Rights Journal is available in print and online. Accessible at the UC Davis Human Rights Initiative webpage and from  MailTo(humanrightsjournalucd AT gmail DOT com)
