Dont be a moron take the perches off your hummingbird feeder! They can hover, and look a lot cooler in motion!

Our only year around resident hummingbird is the Annas Hummingbird (Calypte anna).  The male, although small, has a beautiful bright pink iridescent forehead and throat.  They buzz around the Arboretum feeding on Town Flora flower nectar and are often seen and heard carrying out their mating ritual.  The male slowly flies high up ~60 feet into the air, gives a sharp high pik note, and then dives down with incredible speed usually straight down and only leveling off 13 feet in the air only to repeat the cycle again.  You ought to feel lucky if you are a Davis resident that has Birds and Bird Watching witnessed this amazing display of hummingbird love.

Allens and Rufous hummingbirds can be seen one week out of the year in spring as they come down from Alaska to head to Mexico. Rufous breeds in Alaska with 24 hour light, and they winter in Mexico.
