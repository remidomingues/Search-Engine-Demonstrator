Some insist that Hunan is the finest Americanized Chinese food Chinese food, also referred to as Americanese, restaurant in Davis. And it has a full Bars bar.

Their prices are competitive, especially for lunch  lunch specials include rice (fried or steamed), soup or salad, chow mein, and an entree for $4.75  $6.25. Most chicken and beef selections cost between $5.00 and $5.25. The soup changes from day to day  its egg flower soup on Tuesdays/Thursdays and hot & sour soup on Monday/Wednesday/Friday. The lunch environment is somewhat informal. Almost any given day you will find a large group of college students around one of the larger round tables laughing and having a good time. Service during the lunchtime hours leaves a lot to be desired  dont expect speedy service or water refills! At times, the waiters even act like its a bother just to serve you.

The dinner environment is much more formal and quiet. Prices for dinner are more expensive but servings are much larger. Almost all Soups, Tofu, Vegetables, and Appetizers cost $4.00$6.00. Pork, Beef, and Chicken entrées typically run between $7.00$8.00 and Seafood dishes average between $8.50$11.50.  Dinner service is fast and attentive.  If you dont want to eat there you can also place an order to go and get 10% off.

Prior to March 16, 2009, Hunan was located at 508 2nd Street #104.  They closed for a few weeks and opened at their current 207 D Street location in April 2009.

Charges
Quite a number of people have noted what they believe to be unauthorized charges/tips, typically in very small amounts (ranging from cents to a dollar or so). Although annoying, this practice is common in some restaurants. When authorizing your card, the restaurant places a hold for an estimated price, before the customer indicates how much tip they are leaving on the receipt. The charge should be corrected in a few days when the final transactions are submitted by the restaurant. Before launching a complaint, be sure you waited a few days before checking your bank statement.

20090101 14:14:33 nbsp The Hunan is awesome! I am a big fan of their Hunan Beef and their Honey walnut shrimp. I prefer to go for Lunch because they have their Happy Luncheon where you get a main entree, side of chow mien (which is so good), side of rice (fried or steamed) and a cream cheese wonton. The best part though is the soup included in the luncheon special. I am a big fan of their tasty soups, oh and the salad is great too. I can never quite decide on soup or salad so I usually just get a salad as well :) Dinner isnt too bad of a deal either as they have a similar option to lunch. Overall the Hunan is prob. some of the best chinese I have had. GO TRY IT! Users/hazeleyes16

20090209 03:10:37 nbsp I love coming here for lunch on MWF because they have hot and sour soup on these days. For $6, you can quickly get a large meal. Although everything taste pretty similar, I still think the variety of items you get is worth it. Seems like people complain about customer service since theres only a few people serving a bunch of tables, but as long as I get to order and get my food on quickly, Im happy. Id rather have them leave me alone while Im eating anyway. They do refill your water often. This is my favorite Chinese place for lunch!  Users/TonyaNN

20090214 16:02:01 nbsp I think that while the prices for lunch are really good, the level of customer service (or lack thereof) was just too terrible to warrant another trip back. I really only go for the crab meat fried wontons but I think from now on Ill just get it to go. I had to wait for the host to even bother looking up from his newspaper to get seated and the waitress started walking away before we were even done ordering. When our food got to the table, we realized they messed up half of our order. Service this terrible didnt even deserve the 35 cents I left. The quarter could have been put to better use doing laundry! Users/AliceW

20090221 18:57:47 nbsp The worst customer service I have ever received at a restaurant Users/Jtom23

20090301 20:58:14 nbsp I would only go for their cheap lunches. As many have mentioned, their service is below par... But then again, how much more can you expect from a 5 dollar lunch. Users/renee415

20090308 16:02:09 nbsp Not crazy about the food here, but eh...
 Users/strawberry

20090308 16:47:10 nbsp In short: If you are willing to endure bad service for great (albeit Americanized) cheap food, this is the place for you. I went last night as one of a party of five, including some nonstudents. We had to wait for about five minutes, but that wasnt a problem. The waiter took our order, we waited for about thirty minutes with not a trace of food, not even the soup wed ordered. Meanwhile, two parties that had been seated after us had been served. We flagged down a waitress, who told us very promptly that our waiter had left our order in his pocket and forgot to place it interesting that she knew this and didnt bother to tell us. Our waiter came back to our table, offering us free soda about five times before he finally got the hint and walked away. When he brought the food out about fifteen minutes later, he had the order wrong. The food itself was excellent, though. MAJOR HINT HERE: If you order something with meat and vegetables (e.g. Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Shrimp), they seriously skimp on the meat and put in as many veggies as they can, so ask for no veggies if you know you like Mongolian Beef and lots of it. We had planned not to tip, but one of my friends felt bad and left three dollars, about 7% of our $45 bill. Hopefully that got the point across. The food is good and so are the prices, but the service is awful and I feel like we got the short end of the stick mainly because we are undergrads and they think well wait for anything.  Users/acparsons

20090410 15:26:12 nbsp While the food was great, this place EASILY had the worst service of any restaurant that Ive been to since living in Davis. When my friend and I were seated we waited 10 minutes to get just water and menus, which were only given to us upon request. I requested tea as well, and they brought 1 cup for 2 people. The food came out in an average amount of time and tasted good. After we were done and went to went to pay for the meal, we requested that the check be split. The person working the register said...I guess and then proceeded to lecture us on how hard we were making his job, and that when we got out into the real world we would understand this. Both my friend and I have worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years and understand that it takes no more than 30 seconds to split a two person check. It was almost enough to cause me to go back in and remove the tip from the table.

Long story short, if you want the food, get take out, because the customer service is absolutely horrible. Users/davisreviewer

20090418 15:18:43 nbsp Orange chicken.  OMG so good. Users/CodyDuncan

20090426 18:37:37 nbsp A few simple things to remember here  first, dont expect great service when your meal costs $5.  Second, short of you witnessing the waiter spit in your food, NEVER omit a tip (and 7% might as well be 0%)  this will only make service worse.  Last, remember: the food is cheap.  They dont make their money splitting checks.  They make them by turning tables.  Although the cashier might gripe a little, Ive never experienced true rudeness from any of the staff.  Like most servers, theyre probably overworked and underappreciated.  Just my two cents, FWIW. Users/BigRedGiraffe

20090504 16:20:06 nbsp Good food with good prices. Try their special lunch, especially the honey crispy walnut shrimp, yummy! Users/thtly

20090504 16:22:23 nbsp When I ordered the fried wonton, I expected to have some meat. However, theyre just the fried wonton wrappers. They shouldve stated that in their menu. Users/thtly

  I always was under the impression that fried wontons were just the wrapper, anyways. Ive never seen a restaurant offer fried wontons with meat before, although that would be interesting to try. users/brookeb

20090616 12:46:01 nbsp They had a rat problem in their old location.  There were dead rats in the kitchen area when the space was demod in April.  After they moved out you could see the rats crawling around the empty space.  Saw it with my own eyes.  Never again will I eat at Hunan.   Users/jimb62

20090622 20:16:38 nbsp Hunan is the worse place to eat! Do not go there, they have bad customer service and treat their customers like St Users/Karina

20090714 20:35:46 nbsp How do they get their food out so fast?  Makes me wonder, even though it is delicious!  Customer service sucks tho! Users/davisgirl10

20090716 21:31:41 nbsp It takes awhile to get your food after you order it even when the restaurant isnt buisy. However, I do love their lunch specials.  Users/BryceH

20090724 10:14:30 nbsp The new location is a bit nicer, and oddly enough, the host and waitress (who I think are the owners?) were more friendly here than at the previous location. The food quality has gone downhill, though, which is sad because it was already deliciously crappy and cheap haha. I wouldnt even pay the ridiculously cheap $6.50 or whatever it is now. The last couple of times Ive been there (new and old location) the noodles tasted weird. And for some reason, whenever Ive ordered at night, the food has given me a huge stomach ache (but thats never really happened during the afternoon). My friend and I have discussed that maybe they use the same oil all day and so by dinner time its really dirty and gross. Users/Kiran

20090728 Let me start off by saying that if you haven’t tried Hunan restaurant, then your truly missing out!  Hunan offers some of the best quality Chinese food in the city of Davis, and at a reasonable cost.  I am always looking to try new places to eat in Davis, and lets face it, as a college student, money doesn’t always come so easily.

Hunan is known for having some of the bestvalued lunch specials in Davis.  They offer lunch specials for just $6.50! As I skimmed over the lunch special section of the menu, I couldn’t choose a dish.  There were so many options to choose from.  One second I felt like having the general chicken, the next second I was craving the sesame chicken!  Finally, I decided on the sesame chicken, with half chow mein and half white rice.

After the waiter took my order, I was given a pot of hot tea.  I have never tried the tea before, but it was rather tasty.  The herbal aroma and taste from the tea really sets you in a great mood for the meal.  Hunan also gives you a salad as part of the lunch special.  I was rather surprised that they offered a side along with the main course and tea.  Although the salad didn’t appear to be anything special, it was very tasty.  They serve iceberg lettuce, with honey mustard dressing.  The honey mustard dressing has a nice sweet and tangy taste to it.  Before I even finished my salad, my food had arrived.  The service here is quite fast!  The meal included a crab won ton, which was my first time having any type of seafood.  I fell in love with these won tons.  They were so moist and juicy, and when dipping them in the sweet and sour sauce, they were had a very authentic Chinese (Umami) taste.  As I began to eat the main course, the chow mein was very tasty, and not too oily.  The sesame chicken was cut into thin and crisp slices, and was very tender.  The chicken was very tangy and had moderate spice to it.   The white rice was simply as any white rice would be expected; it complimented the rest of the meal very well.  If you like your food spicy, I recommend adding some of the chili sauce found on the table, which really brings the food to life.  Overall, the food had a very authentic taste to it.

Lastly, the service here at Hunan is very good.  The waiter, although she seemed to be rushing a little, was very prompt to replace my dirty plate, and constantly made sure my glass of water was always full.  Users/simranhundal

20090906 21:28:55 nbsp This place has horrible service. They guy took us to our seats and my mom and me just sat there for a really long time. We didnt even get our menus! When we left they didnt even notice us leave so some restaurant. Users/GuavaLava

20091108 20:37:53 nbsp The lunch special is the bombdiggity! served until 3 pm, only on the weekends. Perfect if you have betweenclass breaks. Service is usually quick and efficient, however, the waiters arent very friendly. The best things on the menu are: sesame chicken, chicken salad (amazing dressing), honey walnut prawns,  and crab meat wontons....we go here basically at least once a week, so its definitely good. Users/mrandmrs

20091124 20:41:14 nbsp Best hot and sour soup in Davis (I have tried them all)!  Certain members of the staff are a little rude though.  Like the guy who works here and doesnt wear the proper outfit but thinks he can just be cool and wear jeans? What a douche! Users/JSlice

20091201 16:39:31 nbsp The new location causes me to not like this restaurant as much as I used to.  I probably wont be going there too much.  I prefer the flaming wok in south davis. Users/jakedavis

20100309 17:21:25 nbsp My bf and I went here this past weekend after the farmers market because we were looking for a quick,cheap sit down lunch. We received just that. The soup I got before my meal was quite tasty, i think it was eggflower soup? Anyways, it looked a lot better than my bfs salad he chose. Our entrees were served about 10 minutes after ordering, not bad! The food itself wasnt bad, I was surprised, for the price im expecting it all to taste the same but it didnt. I had the lemon chicken, it was tasty but had too much lemon sauce. The lady who took our order wasnt very nice, she got really snappy with me when I couldnt understand what she was saying because of her accent. Other than that it was a pretty good experience. I will return Users/TICKtacTOEtag

20100331 00:12:00 nbsp Great food at a great price. Not great service with regard to politeness but usually they serve you pretty fast. The spicy soup is good and so is the lemon chicken. Users/tneeley

20100412 00:17:30 nbsp Cheap lunches and decent food make me go back here regularly. Honey walnut shrimp, beef in spicy garlic sauce, and cream cheese wontons... yum. I also like the new location. Users/susiekim

20100508 21:12:02 nbsp came here with a friend. Lots of food for little money! Although, im not sure if vegetable entrees are vegetarian. Food was pretty good. Food was served immediately and taken right away. Although it didnt feel rushed. Would have appreciated it a bit more if the waiter would have cleared the table and counted his tip AFTER we left.  Users/Vero

20100526 18:45:45 nbsp Ive been eating at Hunan since I was a UCD undergrad nearly a decade ago.  Back then, a huge plate of good quality food for $5 (the happy luncheon) was a godsend.  The price has gone up to around $6 since then, and Im surprised they still manage to keep it that low.  The Hunan staff are some of the hardest working people Ive ever seen.  No matter what time of day or day of the week I show up, I always see the same people working.  Sure, they arent all sparkly sunshine, rainbows, and unicorns when they see you... more like sleep deprivation, sore feet, and nicotine withdrawal.  That being said, in nearly ten years of patronage I have never gotten sick, Ive always enjoyed the food, and Ive sampled a very large portion of their menu.  I can see how some people might take exception to their customer service, but I go to Hunan for their cheap, reliable, and very tasty food.  Yes, there are times I have to wait a while for my food to arrive, but never so long that I dont feel like it was worth the wait when its in front of me.  Concerning the previous comment about rats:  Isnt there flawed logic in saying that youll never eat at Hunans new location because rats were allegedly seen in the vacated previous location of the restaurant?

20110124 12:35:09 nbsp great food at great prices, but recently did not enjoy the walnut chicken (they should warn you about the buttery, creamy sauce they douse it in) Users/tneeley

20110227 21:48:58 nbsp Tried this place for the first time a week or two ago. I must say the fried rice was okay, the chow mein surprisingly good even though it was just noodles (the chow mein I am familiar with has sprouts in it as well?). I had the crispy honey walnut shrimp and was disappointed in the amount of shrimp I got. I only got maybe 8 of them.  Probably will not order that dish again, but will go back if I want Chinese food, although this is a tough rival to Silver Dragon, where I feel you get much bigger portions. Users/redbike

20110606 13:56:12 nbsp Ive eaten here so many times in the last two years that Ive lost track. Sesame chicken is my goto because its consistently good and the sauce is awesome with everything it leaks into (ie rice and noodles). Lemon chicken, walnut chicken, and general chicken are also safe ventures. Im overwhelmingly guilty of being part of the large table of college students being rambunctious and bordering on obnoxious. Surprised they still tolerate us (though we do bring fairly consistent patronage and usually end up seated away from the room of more normal people). Dont think Ive ever eaten there at the beginning of the lunch hour  usually near the end, when there are fewer people and service is faster. The staff is polite but usually rushed. Theyre wellseasoned with ringing up a split check by now, so groups of ten have never been a problem.

Not really a restaurant to bring your family if you want to show them the finedining side of Davis. The lunch hour attracts more of the starving broke student ilk. But overall, Im always happy with the price of the meal compared to its quality and quantity (I have a black hole where a stomach should be but most of the people I eat with will box up half of their food for later). My worst experience yet has probably been my forgetting to ask for a pair of chopsticks and having to eat with a fork (though it does say something about server scarcity).  Users/JaniceW

20110730 02:12:13 nbsp this was my 2nd time eating here. Got the braised whole fish again and it was pleasant just like the first time, if you like whole braised fish that is. Its actually quite tasty. I also had the mixed veggie with tofu, pork with black mushrooms and seaweed egg flower soup.

I didnt know that the usual seaweed egg flower soup is dark in color like theres soy sauce added to the soup base. I thought its usually cooked in a lighter broth with the addition of starch for its thickened consistency.  The soup is ok but lost a lot of that seaweed aroma/flavor.

The braised fish was decent. With its crunchy skin and moist white meat, it was quite pleasant.

The mixed veggie with tofu was disappointing because the veggies tasted old and none of it tasted fresh. The aged veggie taste was masked by the sauce that flooded the bottom of the plate. But for just a little over 6 bucks, i cant really complain but i wish they still used fresher ingredients considering Davis is pretty much a farm town.

The Pork with black mushrooms looks almost identical to the plate of mixed veggies. The only difference is that theres pork, black mushrooms and a few other veggies not in the other dish. Other than that, it all looks the same with the same sauce.

Service was actually quite decent with a  friendly staff but due to the quality of food, I will not return. I believe that even if a restaurant is not as expensive, they can still use fresher ingredients to make a pleasing meal. sadly to say, I will no longer return  Users/C.Ling

20130428 10:43:33 nbsp Love this place!!! Happy Luncheon is the best lunch deal in Davis!! Users/EmmyThill

20140710 15:57:36 nbsp The food is good. However, as the Charges section stated, seem like the minor charge annoyance still exists. Im not sure if its because the cashier cant remember the price right, or they purposely just do a little extra charge for their own benefit. If its for their benefit and greed its almost like stealing, just imagine every time when your charge should be 15.14, they charge you 15.2, I guess a little amount, they think you wont notice, but how about after 5 or 10 times, bad for business. Then sometime, when order ToGo, it says 10% off, but they just take out the tax charge and consider that as 10% off, hello, Davis tax rate is 8%, not 10%, see stealing right there. I guess everybody resorts to all kind of way to gain money now a day. SIGH Users/Cyclonus

20140715 09:43:52 nbsp Another thing I noticed recently is the unfreshness of certain dish Hunan provided. Im not sure if this is ongoing already, but example is usually when something has shrimp, pork or some kind of meat in it, you can end up taste something bad(or something smell bad in it); I bumped into this situation once recently when I ordered their takeout, and while I was dinning in the restaurant, I have heard at least 2 tables of customer complain about such issue to the waitress, the waitress/waiter will of course take that dish away and offer an excuse; either way, I think this is already more than enough to be a problem of Hunan. As food business, I believe fresh preserve measure is a very important factor, since if this measure is not perform well, it can lead many seriousness such as health problem and such. As a matter of fact, I think its unacceptable to even have such problem in a restaurant, any restaurant with that problem needs to be shut down, but thats just me. So, Im not sure if Hunan is short on money so they start to use expired food material to save, theyre just slacking off, dont care, or whatever it is, this is something that someone needs to be aware of!
