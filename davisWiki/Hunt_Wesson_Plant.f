The HuntWesson Plant, a part of Hunt Foods Co., once employed many immigrants, students and residents in its Tomatoes tomato processing operation, but has been Departed Businesses shut down since October 1999. The cannery was originally built around 1963 and used to Essence of Davis scent the Davis air and contributed to hundreds of tomatoes found rolling around and tomato trucks squished near corners. Building the plant was controversial at the time.

50 years ago: 1956 Davis  Local residents voted, 1,473 to 900, in favor of locating a multimilliondollar Hunt Foods Inc. plant in Davis. The vote came in a special straw ballot called by the city council to sample public opinion in a controversy that has stirred considerable heat between the pros and the cons. Results are not legally binding on the council, but will serve as an indication of the sentiment of the community. Proponents of the location of the Hunt plant in Davis had hoped for a twothirds majority.  The Daily Democrat 11/13/2006

It was one of the last of dozens of tomato processing plants in the area to close, and was one of the few unionized industries within Yolo County  it was the only unionized manufacturing industry within the City of Davis during its operation. The facility, with its 564,000 square feet of building space was closed down without notice when owner ConAgra Inc. moved its work to an Oakdale plant  workers showed up for their checks and were told about the closure. Despite its abrupt closure, ConAgra joined with the union representing cannery workers and successfully secured a $910,000 grant to provide job training and placement for displaced workers.

It would be great to see it put back into operation either as a Tomatoes tomato processor, or some other revenue generating source of jobs. There are a variety of high end confectioneries in the Fairfield area; maybe Davis should be known for its own milk chocolate.

20051006 15:52:51 nbsp I havent heard of anyone mentioning the impact of Measure X on the Hunt plant one way or the other. It would seem that if X passes that this property will never again be usable as an industrial facility. Users/JasonAller

20061117 21:01:31 nbsp I worked for Avi from 8992 in Industrial Engineering.  I maintained and wrote several database systems there.  Good times.  I saw the flattened plant a week ago.  I guess thats what they call progress.  What a shock and a rude ending for the oldtimers there.  Terris Users/TerrisLinenbach

20061118 10:40:31 nbsp I should add that there was some discord among the old timers with the Wesson name.  The plant was Hunts as far as they many were concerned.  In my opinion they understandably distrusted the intentions of their corporate masters.  The closure of this plant is just another sad footnote in the history of American corporate behavior.

20110909 10:07:58 nbsp I still remember the scent of cooked tomatoes that would fill the town every year (early August).  That smell to me meant summer was almost over, and it was almost time to go back to school.  Despite the association being a negative one as a kid, its a fond memory... I still miss that smell during warm summer nights. Users/OldDavis73
