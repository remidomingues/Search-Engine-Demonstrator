A new Huong Lan Sandwiches will be coming to Davis in 2013.

On or before September 26, 2006, a sign was posted on the door stating that Huong Lan is closed for remodeling with no reopening date. A for sale sign has been placed in the window as well, and Stones Cafe & Catering now occupies that location.

They serve fresh Vietnamese (Bánh Mì) and American sandwiches, bubble tea, assorted fried foods, spring rolls, flan and assorted Asian desserts. They have a large tapioca drinks selection, second only to the Old Teahouse.

Their board menu lists Western Sanwiches (~$3), Eastern Sanwiches (~$2), Salad (~$5), 13 choices of coffee and juice, 18 tapioca drinks pearl drinks, and 10 smoothies. Yes, the board really does say Sanwiches, not Sandwiches.

The Vietnamese sandwiches run between $2.00 and $2.50, and with sandwiches such as French Pate, there is a wider selection than at either Sunrise Restaurant or Fluffy Donuts. They also have a large staff. Even at peak hours, they are capable of getting you a sandwich within a minute or so. Vietnamese sandwiches tend to be sparsely filled by American fast food standards, hence the lower price. They consist of a crispy white bread roll with filling. The breads bread tends to be a bit tough, but still tasty. The crisp/crunchy (not soft/mushy) nature of the bread is hard on the gums, so you may be feeling a bit of irritation after eating them.

The Davis store is the 6th Huong Lan store. The others are in Milpitas, Newark, Sacramento, San Jose. The space was Departed Businesses previously occupied by Antonios Take and Bake.

$8 minimum for credit card purchases.

They now have free wifi.


20060603 this place is by far the best place for vietnamese sandwiches in davis.  i think the vegetarian one is the best.  this place and sunrise restaurant should not even be placed in the same sentence.  the bread and the condements on the sandwich are way better here.    i dont really think their drinks are that good though, but since tapioca express left and the quality of old teahouse has dropped, a good boba is hard to find in davis.  sandwiches are a great deal from $1.99  $2.49 Users/MattHh

20051003 00:12:50 nbsp I recommend the grilled pork sandwich. Its lovely. Users/DatNguyen

20051003 00:40:08 nbsp Sandwiches are larger and tastier than Sunrise Restaurant Sunrise. Nonetheless, theyre not to good at requesting special orders i.e. no peppers or extra stuffs. Anyhow, they are friendly. The specially prepared real pineapples are canned. The drink, though... tasty. Eggrolls are edible but otherwise suck. Hmm. Thai tea is made by the eye meaning its inconsistent and may be wonderful to crappy depending on the skill level of your server. :) Users/MichaelGiardina
    Ah, thanks for reminding me. The grass jelly drink came straight out of a can and it sure tasted like it did. It was underwhelming. Users/DatNguyen

20051022 20:34:10 nbsp My lychee bubble had pieces of canned lychee in addition to the boba.  I couldnt discern any particular flavor in the liquid portion of the drink.  My porkandbroccoli over rice was very good. Users/JudithTruman

20051113 20:43:04 nbsp the shrimp spring rolls are good ... tasted pretty fresh last time i had them. Users/MindyYang

20051208 13:59:56 nbsp This is my favorite place to get a quick lunch in south davis. The sandwiches are consistently good, and are equal to those of Sunrise Restaurant on a good day.  I particularly like the fish and meatball ones. Im not too keen on the fillings themselves, but the bread used to surround the pork buns and hot dog in the front window are especially good, and are a filling meal for $1.50. Oh, and the egg custard bun is tasty, and highly favored by the ants in my apartment.  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20060316 11:38:41 nbsp Went this morning.  Not open until 9am and open laters on saturdays.  Not sure the exact time though. Users/JudyTang

20060321 21:57:01 nbsp Everyone should try the avocado shake. Its yummy and very rich. Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060407 16:04:30 nbsp The steamed pork sandwich looked just like the one in the picture, which meant only 4 (or 5) thin slices of pork.  Still, it was very yummy (whats that delicious condiment in it?)  There was way too much ice in the honeydew pearl drink, but it was delicious! For a total of less than $5, the sandwich and drink are a very good deal.  Users/JennaChan

20060411 17:57:09 nbsp Not sure about the large staff.  Thats certainly true in Sacramento, but the one in Davis is often understaffed.  Good sandwiches, though. Users/MisterProfessor

20060511 02:12:04 nbsp The spring rolls werent too good last time i got them...the skin was dried out...i think it was b/c i got the first one out of the fridge thing....but my gfs was good she said b/c hers was behind mine so no drying occurred Users/ChrisLee

20060628 01:47:58 nbsp The service has always been good and speey when Ive been there. Living less than five minutes away in Greystone I am grateful for this place as a cheap eat I can run to at random times of the day. Im a fan of basically all the food items they carry, but am more of a Old Teahouse kind of guy when it comes to their drinks. Recommeneded: 3.50 Chicken leg with Rice, Vermicelli Noodle Eggroll thingies with Pork, Custard Buns, and the Lychee Drink Users/AlvinTsao

20060708 10:16:18 nbsp The guy behind the counter with a skewed cap is really friendly and accomadating(sp?). I asked for cucumbers in my sanwiches and they didnt charge extra for them.  Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060805 13:26:25 nbsp This place is freaking awesome. Sanwiches are really good and cheap, and the bubble tea here is the best in town (until Tapioca Express comes back!).  War Sanwiches! Users/VietNguyen

20060822 11:04:06 nbsp I advise people to just order the sandwiches because theyre made on the spot whereas their other dishes wrapped in plastic may have been sitting for a while.  Buy the sausages (Cha) theyre cheap and good. Users/PorkFoo

20060828 18:21:04 nbsp They now have pearl tea stamp cards; I think its buy 10 get one free. Also, they have specials on Monday: buy one pearl tea or smoothie, get one Eastern sandwich free! Users/ThuHo

20060926 20:12:21 nbsp Im skeptical about the remodeling.  Im thinking they just shut.   They stayed open all through the slow summer months, then closed for remodeling a few days before school starts?   Doesnt make sense.   If theyre gone Ill miss them.  Their sandwiches were a really good deal.   Anyone know another place in Davis that sells sardine sandwiches? Users/SteveGreen

20060926 20:15:39 nbsp I just checked their website, hlsandwiches.com, and the Davis store has been deleted.  I hope another store just like it opens in that spot. Users/SteveGreen

20060926 22:41:07 nbsp I dont recall the Davis location ever being on their website actually. But I agree that the remodel is pretty suspicious. Users/AndrewChen

20060927 07:52:34 nbsp This place was great   if a bit slow. Passed last night and saw that the place is For Sale :( Users/GarethBevan

20060928 12:44:24 nbsp I tried to go with my family and a friend a few days ago.  There were people inside, but it wasnt open.  Too bad.  I really like the sandwiches and the people here.  I think the comment above is correct in saying that the chain has never mentioned the Davis store.  It looks like Ill have to be going to the HL near SF Market in Sacramento more to get my sandwich fix. Users/MisterProfessor

20060929 00:46:38 nbsp Its hard to pay Davis commercial rents selling $2.95 sandwiches.  Youve got to sell high volumes which HL store didnt have.   Lees sandwich shops around the Bay have low prices and high rents  but they do a huge volume.   Lees is expanding rapidly and I think theyd see great success in Davis, although not in the Huong Lan location.   Not big enough.   Anyhow Ill miss HL.       Users/SteveGreen

20061002 00:43:30 nbsp Theres a Free Sandwich with any Pearl Drink coupon in the Davis Enterprise of September 28printed a week or more after Hoang Lan closed!   Makes me think they closed on short notice.   The For Sale sign in the window says the restaurant is available for $20,000.  Its unusual to frankly advertise price like that, in a store window. Users/SteveGreen

20070202 10:03:25 nbsp Does anyone know exactly what will be taking HLs place?  I saw a scribbled sign indicating some sort of gormet coffee shop.  Can anyone confirm or elaborate? Users/JasonHaberman

Stones will be the new occupant in the now closed HL Bakery at the 5th street plaza. We will be serving Fair Trade Organic coffee and Teas, hot and cold expresso drinks, smoothies, as well as freshly made sandwiches, salads, and soups. Catering will also be a service offered at Stones. Should be opening sometime around the end of the month. stay tuned for more!
