20070114 19:37:20 nbsp That is utterly awesome.  The closest I can come to that is the water ballon launchers that take 3 people.  Users/StevenDaubert

20070509 15:03:16 nbsp Nice.  At the kids school there are a couple of catapults using vinyl tubing that the kids shoot those pool sponge balls at each other with.... at a range of about 30 to 40 feet.  Ill try to find some photos. Users/RocksandDirt

20070510 06:41:52 nbsp In Mrs. Cooks sixth grade class at Robert E. Willett School we made catapults and launched marshmallows half the class against the other half. My catapult was very small, using less than two feet of 2x4, some other scrap wood, a nylon strap and rubber bands, but it was just as good or better than some of the bigger ones.

20090430 14:24:04 nbsp This thing really needs to get out and stretch its legs before the lumber atrophies. Im currently trying to set something up, hopefully for the 2nd or the 16th, but well see how that pans out.  Hopefully well be able to get a few rounds off before maintenance crews show up for an unscheduled silent protest.  Users/MasonMurray

20090926 20:13:02 nbsp Ahhh reminds me of eighth grade, when me and my friends decided to build a Trebuchet out of PVC piping... It was a BLAST

Whens the next demo? Users/JamesM
