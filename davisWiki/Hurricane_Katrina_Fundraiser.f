Philip and Mike, could the wiki help initiate a fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina? Could you guys use the same system you did for the Wiki Donations to set up an account for Hurricane donations? If you think this page is a dumb idea, just delete it...no hard feelings Users/JimSchwab
  Theres no sense in setting up a PayPal account for donations, but I added a list of organizations accepting donations. Users/MikeIvanov
 Thanks Mike! Users/JimSchwab
 Charities Accepting Donations NOW 

Here is a short list of some of the betterknown charitable organizations that can use your help.  Most, if not all, take donations through their web sites.

  http://www.redcross.org American Red Cross   (800) HELPNOW
  http://www.salvationarmyusa.org The Salvation Army   (800) SALARMY (7252769)
  http://www.mercycorps.org Mercy Corps   (888) 2561900
  http://www.secondharvest.org Americas Second Harvest  (800) 7712303
  For a much more comprehensive list, try http://www.truthlaidbear.com/katrinacharities.php here

  Charities are also signing up new volunteers to travel out to the disaster area to help with the relief efforts.  Normally the Red Cross requires a commitment of up to 3 weeks, but this time they are allowing for 9day commitments.  If you can spare the time and want to help, hop on board.  Salvation Army (and probably the other relief agencies) are also accepting new volunteers.
