20100514 14:17:39 nbsp I would be interested in the opinions/experiences of any parents who have or had kids in daycare here. I have taken the tour and found it to be clean and bright but it is difficult to find out more about it from unbiased sources because it is so new. Users/RachelD

20101006 13:21:41 nbsp My son has been at this center since the day it opened, more than 2 years ago.  Its expensive but I have been very happy with the care and level of professionalism.  My son has special needs and he has always been accommodated and included.  My only compliant would be staff turnover I am sorry to see good teachers move on but I think this is a problem in the childcare field in general, not specific to this center.  Love the staff, the facility (bright, clean), and the developmental basis of their program. Users/KalistaHickman

20120530 14:55:56 nbsp After visiting many daycares in town, this place is by far the brightest and cleanest.  I too was looking forward to hearing from parents but I think most parents dont know or have the time to come on here to comment so hopefully this will help parents decide which daycare is best for their child.  I have 2 kids at the center, all started in the infant room, the oldest is in Preschool.  The teachers and staff are great.  I do agree they had a high turnover rate of teachers but it has stabilized quite a bit over the last year.  My kids come home learning new things everyday, they use positive reinforcement (no time outs), theyve started a cultural and food curriculum, they are open to suggestions and input from parents, and the staff there are really caring and nurturing.  The infant room staff put my mind at ease when returning to work.  They allow visits all day and theyll accommodate the best they could to make transitioning to daycare easier.  Ive never tried another center but HCDC has definitely made a difference in my life as well as my childrens.  Another reason I chose this center is because of its vacation schedule.  It matches the Universities so there are no random days off.  The only downside I see to this center is the tuition rate.  It is the highest in town and it doesnt offer sibling discount or summer discount like the other University affiliated daycare center.  Overall, I highly recommend this place and Im sure some of the other HCDC families would say the same.   Users/BingL

20140531 15:28:11 nbsp For any parent interested in sending kids to Bright Horizon Hutchison CDC, I would strongly recommend you to speak with those parents whose children are currently enrolled in this school before making a decision.  While Bright Horizon has made significant investment to make the classrooms look clean and elegant, the school is facing a critical issue  staff turnover.  In most classes of this center, kids will have to meet new teachers every 612 months due to teachers leaving.  Using the words from a recent email from their regional director:  While we are in a University town and some turnover is to be expected, what we have experienced as of late is more than what we would consider “normal”.    As a matter of fact, the current facility director herself will be leaving in a month.  In comparison, many other childcare providers in Davis have teachers who have served in the same schools for ten, twenty years.

With such high staff turnover rates in Hutchison CDC, there is essentially no consistency or continuity in students education.  Sometimes parents are confused whether the person with their kids is a new staff member or other kids parent.  Its ironic that the tuition of this childcare center is among the highest in town, while the pay and benefits to its teachers are the worst.  It looks like the issue is rooted in Bright Horizons business model:  fancy classrooms + low pay for teachers (they often hire young teachers fresh out of school who are willing to take low salaries for the experience to apply for better jobs elsewhere).
