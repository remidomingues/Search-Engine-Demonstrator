The Hutchison Hall Computer Labs (Rooms 73, 75, 78, and 93) are computer labs located in the basement of Hutchison Hall.  Room 78 is the open access room. Rooms 73, 75, and 93 are computer classrooms.

These labs are often pretty empty due to them being in a slightly out of the way place and not being very obvious (in the basement).  PLS21 is held here in room 73 so the room is often reserved.  As always, check the signs outside the doors to the labs before entering to see if the room is reserved or not.  That way classes will not be disrupted.
