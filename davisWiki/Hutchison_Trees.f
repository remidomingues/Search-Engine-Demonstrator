The trees along Hutchison Dr. on Campus are all tagged with ID numbers.


What in the world would happen if you switched the numbers around?  They seem to only be in semisequence as you walk in a given direction.  Is this how they keep track of the trees?  Do we keep careful records of every tree on campus  enough to catalog their numbers?  If so  thats pretty cool!

 The Grounds division has a database of all the trees on campus with GPS coordinates for them.
