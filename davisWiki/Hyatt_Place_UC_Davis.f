The building has the same type of stone on the outside of the building as the Mondavi Center.

 Controversy 
The hotel, originally slated to have 150 rooms, cut the number in half due to community concern about the impact on other local hotels. It was also the target of two different lawsuits filed by Davis residents concerned with its impact. The delays due to the lawsuits (one of which settled, while the other was dismissed) were sufficient to cause the original developer to back out in 2004, but the project proceeded to completion by 2010 with a new developer.

20100319 20:25:20 nbsp It has been really interesting to watch this place get built. One thing that struck me from the beginning is that the pool looks very small.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20100505 22:08:50 nbsp Saw the bright neon sign from the freeway and thought that it doesnt match the artistic nature of the Mondavi center. Am I the only one?  Users/LeeY

20120408 22:10:46 nbsp My parents stayed here for a UC retirees meeting a few months back.  They enjoyed their stay overall and found it to be a nice hotel.  They had a couple of minor issues, though, which I thought Id mention here in case the management/staff are reading.

First, they had a problem with the shower door, which was apparently installed incorrectly so that any water spraying against the door would spray right out through a gap between two sheets of glass.  They called down to the front desk and someone came up to check it out, but they said he more or less just shrugged it off, saying maybe it had been installed incorrectly.  They were guessing it was a student who didnt really have a role in maintenance or management, since he didnt seem too interested/concerned.

The second thing is pretty amusing.  The breakfast (which they said was pretty nice) had a big thing of hot oatmeal.  My mom got a bowl of oatmeal and took a bite, only to realize that it was gravy for biscuits  it wasnt labeled.  Apparently a couple of other people in their group also made the same mistake.  She mentioned it to a waiter or someone, and they said that the Hyatt organization has very exact requirements for what goes out at breakfast.  The individual hotel, the employee said, cant make any changes, not even adding a little label/placard next to a hot food container.  The employee asked something to the effect of isnt it obvious?  Apparently its not, though, since multiple made the same mistake in the same conference/group in a single weekend.

Again, though, overall they had a positive experience.  Just a couple of little quirks/service issues that management might want to check into. Users/TomGarberson
