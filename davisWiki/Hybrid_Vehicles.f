Hybrid Automobiles have both a Gas Stations gasoline engine and an Electric Vehicles electric motor. That makes them more complex to Automobile Repair repair but more Environmental Organizations environmentally friendly than traditional forms of automobile Transportation transportation.

 PlugIn Hybrids and the UC Davis HEV Center 
UC Davis PHEV Center (http://phev.ucdavis.edu/ PlugIn Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center) is working on the next generation of plugin hybrid electric vehicles (http://mae.ucdavis.edu/faculty/frank/frankphevdefinitions.html PHEV a.k.a. REEV or EREV) which can be plugged into an electrical wall outlet and charged, for instance, when you sleep at night. A bunch of plugin vehicles have been built at the HEV Center. PlugIn technology is the ideal solution for both energy crisis and environmental problems, at least for now, while a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle costs about a million dollars.  The potential in savings for operating costs is considerable.  With gasoline at $3 per gallon (Sept. 2005), the power generated by contemporary hybridcar engines works out to about 52 cents per kilowatthour, while the ability to tap into residential electricity costs only 11 cents per kilowatthour.

UC Davis HEV Center is participating in the http://www.challengex.org ChallengeX competition. In this challenge, sponsored by the US Department of Energy & General Motors, seventeen university teams have been challenged to reengineer a GM Equinox, a crossover sport utility vehicle, to minimize energy consumption, emissions, and greenhouse gases while maintaining or exceeding the vehicles utility and performance.

 Discussion 

My husband and I got our our red 2004 Prius last summer.  We waited for nearly 6 months.  We love her a lot, although our gas mileage isnt as good as wed hoped.  Her name is Harmony. ~Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
   That red color is really nice! Whats your average gas mileage around town? Users/JackHaskel
     The problem for us is that we dont really get to drive in town much.  In Davis, I am usually taking small trips and my communte is a straight shot to West Sac.  We average between 4245 overall.  One day I got lost in a residential area of Sac and my milage shot up to 54 as I wondered around.  Long trips we might get 47 or so.  I really just want to have one tank where I get over 50 overall.  I have just heard some info about tire pressure, and how that can effect your mileage pretty dramatically.  Are you thinking of getting a hybrid? Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

Although not a hybrid, my 98 TDI Jetta (with my username on the plate!) gets around the same mileage as the hybrids coming out.  If VW/AUDI come out with a TDIbased Hybrid, the mileage would likely be close to 70 or 80 MPG.  For the Record, I currently get 4550 MPG for highway and 4045 for city mileage. Users/TarZxf
   My friend has a diesel Jetta and loves it.  He claims Diesel is better for the environment than regular gas, but I have a hard time believing him.  It just doesnt make sense to me, but with that high of mileage, youre still doing your part for the environment and your pocketbook.  I wish VW would make a hybrid Beetle.  On the subject of license plates, theres a Honda Insight in town with the plate I (heart) 63 MPG It always makes me smile. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
     Diesel has much more energy and releases much more energy per gallon than gasoline, so other than the particulate matter that many diesel engines release in the exhaust they are much more environmentally friendly.  In addition it is possible to make diesel in your garage from waste vegitable oil. Users/rocksanddirt

Plugin hybrids make me wonder. Where does the juice coming out of the outlet come from? If its a nuclear/wind plant, great  but if its a fossilfuel plant, whats the point? Users/DomenicSantangelo
   Our juice inevitably comes from wiki:WikiPedia:Power_grid The Grid, and thus from mixed power sources.  But let us imagine that only fossilfuel power existed: overall emmissions would still be minimized by burning coal or crude oil in largescale power plants, where efficienciesofscale can be realized, and distributing the resulting power to electric vehicles.  So rest assured that no matter where they are plugged in, plugin hybrids will, overall, consume less fossilfuel than their purely gasolinepowered counterparts.   Users/ErikAnderson Erik Anderson
      This assumes the efficiencies of scale are enough to make up for the power transmission loss between the power plant and the plug (generally ~8%), though this is practically always true. Just something to think about... Users/ErikFriedlander Erik Friedlander
         Duly noted!  Similarly, some marginal energy loss is also entailed by transporting fuel by tanker truck and perhaps trips to the gas station on the part of the consumer.  But the main consideration is the expense of the refining process itself.  Cars dont run on coal or crude oil  in distilling the latter into gasoline, even more energy is expended.  Users/ErikAnderson Erik Anderson



I know this little tid bit wont make me popular, but here goes. I would STRONGLY recommended staying away from electric and hybrid vehicles. The hybrid battery is highly unsafe and contains worse gases than that of a large truck from the early 1970s. Also smogs are only done at a max of 45MPH, being that the faster you go in a hybrid, the less electric it is and more gas power it has. At wide open throttle in a prius, it is running richer, which means more CO2 and more NOx. Not to mention the process of making these batteries is horrendous. I know that fact gets tossed around a lot, but its very true. The area where they make these batteries is now so barren that NASA uses it to test their vehicles. Not to mention the numerous safety hazards in hybrids.

 As for electric, you are actually doing EXACTLY what gas powered cars are doing. Are you aware that the largest producer of electricity in the US is petro(Fossil Fuels) so you are still in the same circle. If we all used Electric cars, then we would still be using up fossil fuels and still creating green house gases.

Here is a breakdown of electrical sources in the US:

Petro: 40%
Coal: 26%
Natural Gas: 20%
Nuclear Energy: 8%
Renewable Energy: 6% :(


I would also caution against electric cars because they punish those around you. It will cause electric bills for everyone to rise due to supply and demand. Right now those of us on bikes laugh at gas prices. But electric will effect us now. My advice is to go Diesel. It has endless potential, or you can spend money and have your cars air fuel ratio tuned out properly. I did and it was well worth the money. Also, after I had my vehicle tuned it passed emissions with flying colors. So please do some research on what youre buying into, I would hate to see us going in just another circle.

 Now before I get a lor of angry messages, I would encourage you to simply look up and research what I said. If I get a scanned I will scan my class books to show you what I know.

Thanks :D  Users/Dozer
  Its funny, whenever I hear about the relative merits of electric or hydrogen cars, I always think about one of my classes back in my college days, when a professor told us that those methods are basically the same as normal gas, just with a longer tailpipe. The point is that hydrogen and electric are not energy sources in and of themselves, but methods of energy transmission. Electricity comes from the grid, and the power in the grid is produced in proportion to the sources listed above. Hydrogen generally comes either from fossil fuels/ methane, or from electricity. Thus, what we really need to do is find a better source for electricity, and make a concerted effort to change our infrastructure to utilize those new sources.
  Oh, also, nonplugin hybrids are actually a really good idea, because they increase gas mileage by recapturing energy we normally lose, like the energy from braking. If we can achieve a high efficiency with that, you  could get cars that are mostly running on previously generated electricity. Actually, at high enough recapture efficiency, and with good enough solar cells, you could make a car that is not necessarily using gas on normal trips. Just a thought. Users/JoePomidor
  This is a Davis Wiki  why are you using statistics for the U.S. at large?  More relevant are the California statistics. According to a http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2011/04/13/BUA91IVBDL.DTL recent article in the S.F. Chronicle: Just this past Tuesday (April 12, 2011), Governor Jerry Brown signed a law requiring Californias utilities to get 33 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by the end of 2020. From the article: Californias large, investorowned utilities were supposed to meet the original target of 20 percent renewable power by the end of 2010. Two of them came close. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., based in San Francisco, derived 17.7 percent of its electricity from renewable sources last year, while Southern California Edison got 19.4 percent. The new law requires that all the states utilities, public and private, reach 33 percent in three steps. First, they must satisfy the original 20 percent goal by the end of 2013, at the latest. By Dec. 31, 2016, 25 percent of the electricity they sell must come from renewable sources. Finally, they must hit 33 percent by Dec. 31, 2020.
 You might still not think these percentages are high enough to matter (I would say that they are).  But at least consider the relevant facts.   Users/CovertProfessor
