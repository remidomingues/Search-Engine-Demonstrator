Hydrogen Vehicles are unique vehicles and fleet prototypes that can be spotted around town and on I 80.   Most call the California Fuel Cell Partnership, located right up the freeway in West Sacramento home.  There is a hydrogen fueling station on campus.

Unlike most prototype and experimental vehicles, most fuel cell cars generate enough electricity to use regular car frames.  Thus they look like normal recent model cars with a simple Hydrogen Vehicle sticker or label, usually on the back and low on the side.
