 The discussion that led up to the article 

For the next issue of HyperText, IETs quarterly student newsletter of campus computing news, were going to be running an article about the Davis Wiki. Were calling for requests for pages to be included in a Highlights of the Wiki section.

If possible, please include in your suggestions:
  A few of your favorite pages on the wiki
  Whats interesting about them
  Some of their main features
  And, if the pages are large, complicated, or tricky, some suggestions on how to navigate them
   Im not sure Ive encountered pages where navigation was so bad as to warrant explanation.  Maybe some of the features of the wiki might be tricky, but reading a page should be fairly effortless!

Thanks!


20050910 16:39:26 nbsp Cmon folks, add your favorite wiki pages! I vote Restaurants Users/MichaelGiardina

20050910 16:40:43 nbsp I vote Sex!! ;) hehe Users/VivianPham

20050910 16:55:09 nbsp Prostitution, easily Users/ApolloStumpy

20050910 17:04:36 nbsp This page seems to be degrading quickly lol. Come on guys, this is a publication thats distributed all over campus  its a good change to highlight the wiki. (This is Mike not Vivian haha) Users/VivianPham

20050910 17:07:44 nbsp They should give us a word limit and any general requirements and let the wiki write the article. Users/CarlMcCabe

20050910 17:11:28 nbsp Imaging reading this article, only each time you come back to read it someone else has stopped by to improve it in some small way. Imagine if you too could edit it and improve it. The underlying principle has been applied to a website about Davis that has already seen over a year of improvement and now has 5000 pages that have been added, editied, revised, and are waiting for you to improve  were you thinking of something like that Carl? Users/JasonAller

20050910 17:17:34 nbsp Yeah, that sounds really good.  You know, that might also be a great way to open the Wiki: Press Release press release (if people are still thinking about it). Users/CarlMcCabe

The Payphone Project is my favorite page/set of pages on the wiki.  Its collection of information and photographs of payphones around town.  Most of these phones will be gone in 10 years or so given the rate of cellular phone adoption.  It combines wiki:WikiPedia:2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly 2600esque technology lore with the need to archive the fleeting, and its very, very local.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050910 18:35:26 nbsp yeah, but payphone info is 99% useless. its cool, but useless. an uptodate list of wifi hotspots is more useful. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050917 09:38:09 nbsp Has Users/HelenCunningham Helen Cunningham checked back in? What other information is needed for the article? Users/JasonAller

20050917 10:33:06 nbsp My picks: Night Time, Town Flora, The Worst Intersection in Davis, InNOut Secret Menu, Living Cheaply, Mystery Picture and Good Ideas For Dates.  Im very tempted to add Police Misconduct Stories, as it illustrates how the wiki can be socially relevant in a very serious way, although I worry about some of the content. Users/JabberWokky

20050917 10:34:13 nbsp Id say a good critera is: Useful, quirky, innovative, Wiki original content and demonstrative pages.  Thats how I picked the above. Users/JabberWokky

20050917 10:42:46 nbsp A good substitution for the Police Misconduct page, in terms of positive social impact, would be to highlight the {{{Honorable Businesses}}} and Unethical Business Practices pages. Users/CarlMcCabe
  I retract this comment since it looks like those pages are about to get axed.  Nevertheless, I think the ability to see customer comments highlighting the good and bad among Davis businesses is a great feature of the wiki.  I think this will have an increasingly strong effect on the community because it will shed light on those businesses that seem to be Shadiness Factor lurking in the shadows.  Hopefully it will force them to reconsider their practices.  ...and yeah, well, Hot Sauce is pretty cool too.

20050917 12:04:13 nbsp dont forget Hot Sauce Users/ArlenAbraham

20050918 03:33:41 nbsp Im partial to ASUCD, even though its a long and somewhat confusing page.  It covers a huge amount of material, but in a relatively unbiased way (except against Vicki, of course). I dont know how else any normal person would even know anything the student government did without ASUCD wiki branch pages.  Not that Im dissing The Aggie  the wiki is just a better format here. Users/BrentLaabs

20051002 11:27:51 nbsp That was an excellent article! Users/JackHaskel
