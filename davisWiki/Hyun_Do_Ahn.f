Hyun Do Ahn was a South Korean exchange student here at UC Davis who died during an 11day backpacking trip in Yosemite National Park. He studied English and learned how to surf in the States.

He was reported missing when he missed his flight back home to South Korea.

He died of an apparent fall 20 miles from the beginning of his trek. A ranger said that of the last five hikers to go missing in Yosemite, four (including Ahn) traveled alone. http://www.dailyrepublic.com/articles/2005/08/11/local_news/news07.txt Its not something we encourage, the ranger said.


I was actually a friend of Hyun Do. I know it was not his original intention of going on this expedition alone, but decided to continue it even after not finding anyone to go with him. According to Yosemite officials he may have sustained a fall, but he was cause of death was due to multiple blunt force injuries most likely sustained after slipping while attempting to cross a swollen creek. According to journal entries, he most likely died 5 days after his missed flight.  Users/CarlosBarahona
