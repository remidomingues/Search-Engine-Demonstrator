20081029 17:03:06 nbsp Hi IDoNotExist.  I am astonished to be talking to one who does not exist, but then, you spoke to one who is covert, so I guess logic is just out the window at this point.

You had asked, Im wondering what your thoughts are on life as a professor. How is it different than you might have expected? Do you get to spend as much time as you would like on your research? What suggestions do you have for the future professors out there?

Well, I could go on and on, but Ill give you what comes to mind first, and feel free to ask more questions if you have them.

I like being a professor quite a bit.  It is extremely rewarding to be able to expose students to things that they may not have come across before, and to get them to think about them.  I also enjoy researching; its wonderful to have a community of people to share ideas with, since most people dont have a background in the sort of work I do.  Service... well, thats less exciting, but it has its moments.  :)

One thing that is different from what I expected is how little time I have.  I always wondered why my professors seemed so busy  now I know.  Basically, there is an infinite amount of work that you could be doing, and a lot of it you would really like to be doing.  But its nice to have a life, too.  So, you have to learn how to be satisfied with the amount of work you are getting done and still be satisfied with your nonacademic life.  Its a balance I am still striving to achieve.  So, do I have enough time for research?  Enough to satisfy the powersthatbe, yes.  Enough to do everything I want to do?  No, there are things I am dying to do, projects on the pile that I may never get to.  But I guess its better that way than to have nothing I want to do.  :)

Suggestions for future professors... hmmm... One is, know what you want in terms of a balance of research and teaching, and try to find a university that has a good fit.  But accept that jobs are scarce, and so you may not be able to find your ideal job, initially or ever.  Another is not too put too much time into your lectures (its a mistake almost every new prof makes)  you realize that theres only so much you can get across in a lecture, and that after awhile there is a real diminishing return in the amount of time you put in.  Yet another is to go to conferences (never too early to start) and make friends.  This doesnt mean suck up to the big names in the field (though many try that route), this means get to know people working on subjects you are interested in.  It will pay off in multiple ways.  And for my last suggestion... learn how to say no to things that wont help you (you especially dont want to agree to too much service work when youre starting out) and yes to opportunities that allow your name to be known and get you to meet people in your field.  Sounds simple, but the no part is especially hard.

Ok, thats it for now. Users/CovertProfessor

P.S.  Oh, I forgot to mention one thing.  Even though you work a gazillion hours, you are the one who is in charge of them, and you are more or less youre own boss.  Id much rather have it that way than work a 9 to 5 job any day.

20081029 17:37:59 nbsp I think Im talking to myself?  But I cant see myself, so Im not sure.

Id not heard about the service component before. What is it?

On the department level: committees, advising, chair (avoid if you can!).  At the college/university level: more committees.  Beyond the university: refereeing for journals, being involved in the work of societies, donating time to things related to your area of specialization.  No one gets tenure becaue they did a lot of service, but everyone has to do some of it.  Its remarkably easy to get sucked into too much, so again, learn how to say no.  (As in: Id really like to, but I have this big project Im working on  everyone expects that your research will come first, especially as a new faculty member).

Ive seen many profs working very very long hours up until they get tenure. How long does tenure take to achieve? What makes someone well qualified for tenure? What makes them unqualified? Is it all about being able to bring in funding?

Generally 6 yrs, though it can vary from univ to univ.  Requirements for tenure also vary from univ to univ, and from area to area.  Its a good thing to try to find out (stealthily) when interviewing for a job.  Theres much more emphasis on bringing in funding in the sciences than in other areas, but in general, the main thing is publishing in peer reviewed journals.  You usually need to have at least decent teaching reviews, too, though again, that depends on whether youre at a more researchoriented univ or more teachingoriented (which would usually have lower expectations for #s of articles published).  Some areas expect a book.

Ive also heard much of politics being a big thing among professors  fighting for lab space, funding, and whatever else professors fight over (what DO they fight over?) How do you handle the politics? What causes it? Can it be avoided?

I dont think were any more or less political than anyone else, but there can be infighting when there are perceived unfairnesses.  You can have people thinking they are big shots and deserve more than everyone else.  A congenial department is worth its weight in gold.  Try to get a sense of that when you interview if you can.  And if youre untenured, just try to stay out of it.  Focus on your research and teaching, be polite to everyone, and keep your mouth shut (I wasnt very good at the latter, but its good advice nonetheless). Users/CovertProfessor

20081029 18:17:12 nbsp If a professor talks on the wiki, but cant hear themselves, do they make a sound? How do your grad students find you, being so covert? :)

I am like batman  right in front of your eyes, but you dont see my true identity.  :)

How hard is it to get grants?

Theres no universal answer  it depends on who youre applying to.  Its hard.  You really have to know your audience and tailor to them (e.g., if they are not specialists in your field, you have to write in ways that are understandable to them).  You have to dot all your is and cross all your ts.  Grant apps are a real PITA, to tell the truth.

What makes for a good prof. applicant?

Again, varies from field to field, but you want proof of good research done (ideally, with some papers published).  Some fields expect you to postdoc, some dont.  Youll want to have people write letters for you who can really speak to your research abilities and contributions  ideally, not just your advisors, but people well known in your field.  Evidence of good teaching if youre applying to a more teachingoriented place. Users/CovertProfessor

20090922 17:21:18 nbsp It is always possible to overlay vector data atop air photos, but it isnt always the best way of doing things.  In this case, the file size would mushroom, unprintable in B&W, and the map may become too busy or unreadable.  Putting labels directly into apartment footprints is also possible but because of their close proximity and often small footprints, that would become messy very quickly.  Labeling all streets would also have the same impact: many are very small and close together; the map would not be very readable.  The key here is that these are maps of apartments in Davis, not a straight map of Davis.

Fortunately most apartments are on major thoroughfares and their given street addresses make it clear what road they are on anyway.  The aim here is to create useful maps while not making them so busy that one must really concentrate to read them.  Its a difficult job in cartography to find the right balance between conveying information and good presentation. I find that many maps have too much information.  So I do not plan on adding aerial backdrops, names of most residential streets, and labeling over apartments.  But if you want to make your own based on City of Davis GIS library, thatd be great.

20100309 13:43:50 nbsp To keep the Criticism page from becoming a total mess, I would like to reply here.
  I am confused as to what your first four sentences are addressing.
  Does the university let companies use the results of their research for free? What about grants provided by companies to research specific things? Any costs of the research should be paid for by those profiting off the research.
  Invading Iraq for oil seems quite illogical because it would have been much cheaper to purchase oil from a dictator who has no reservations about killing his own people than a democracy that has a choice on whom to make a contract with.
  Californias taxes and businesses: http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id3222 (sorry for just linking instead of writing, but not enough time to)
  Californias regulation and businesses: http://articles.sfgate.com/20090925/bayarea/17205257_1_regulationseconomyreport , http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/13/business/fismallbiz13 (sorry again) Users/hankim

20100309 16:52:50 nbsp   I think you misunderstood me. I meant with the billions generated from research, I would think the universities would be more financially stable.
  My original argument stated that Californias taxes to support education will chase away the ones who are paying for Californias budget. Properly subsidized education can provide a net return to tax payers, but the current system does not seem to be a properly subsidized education system, especially since the high taxes chase away those who are educated after they graduate, where the net return is supposed to come from. You listed education as an industry, so I became very confused when you started talking about research. Sure, research is performed at the universities and although that may contribute to a few people profiting, they have taken everyones tax dollars to do so. Of course, you could argue if an industry improves, the entire economy improves, but that does not mean you should just give tax dollars to random companies to improve the economy.
  Why would oil companies want to invade Iraq if they could get the same oil from Saddam for probably cheaper? What reasoning can you give for oil contributing to the invasion of Iraq besides government incompetence?
  LA still gets very bad pollutionwise and although some of the regulation might have helped LA, too much of the legislation passed or going through California only harms Californias economy without reducing pollution. I believe the one I can most easily recall is the regulation of big screen televisions that passed a while back.  Users/hankim

20100309 17:29:09 nbsp So if we ever want new technology, we should just require it by law? California tried this a few time with cars and had to push back several times. Also, this just encourages people to purchase televisions across state lines taking money out of the state. Did you take a look at the articles that I linked to?

Maybe this is just the Bay Area, but quite a few companies have been downsizing and leaving due to current events leaving quite a few laidoff. And the Cato article that I linked to before contradicts what you claim about private industry in California.

I agree education is an industry, but it does not belong on the list that you created because it currently does not create more funding for California than it costs.

Oil companies did have access to Iraqs oil with Saddam in power though. Users/hankim

20100309 20:57:13 nbsp Saving money on electricity is important in my book (financial responsibility and being environmentally responsible can go hand in hand). Once enough people own big screen televisions to realize that they are having an impact on their wallets, the demand probably would increase. Having the government create demand by forcing people to move to new technologies (maybe people who use an antenna really do not care about how clear their televisions are) is unnatural and can cause negative side effects to society by helping a useless company gain an advantage or wasting tax dollars. And there are incentives to be environmentally friendly. In fact, there are enough incentives, that companies are always advertising how environmentally friendly their products are because there is such a demand for these types of products.

As someone planning to jump into the technology industry, I have been keeping a few tabs on companies in the Bay Area. They have not been laying off workers because of the depression, they have been laying off workers because they were moving to Nevada: http://reason.org/news/show/122553.html

P.S. This is sort of like email chess.  Users/hankim

20100310 08:42:20 nbsp Most of the stories I hear are from laidoff employees and those who are jobsearching. They know that the companies that they worked for have been downsizing in California due to the high operating costs here. I just linked to those sites so that I would not rely only on anecdotal evidence.

For health and safety regulations, why would there not be a market demand for seat belts and airbags? Nowadays, you can see car companies constantly bragging about their safety ratings in their commercials. The thing is that there is a market demand for safer vehicles and companies like Ford started offering these as an option after someone found a need for safety devices and invented them. If I were these car companies, I would probably push for seat belt legislation so that I could force everyone to purchase things that were formerly optional.

You mentioned lead in gasoline, but it took the EPA nearly twenty years to be able to do anything about it due to politicians who were in the pockets of some of the benefiting companies. The reason why the EPA was actually ever able to do anything was because most of the cars that required leaded gasoline were junked at that point in time and there were better alternatives. Of course, if we were to give the EPA too much power, they would just completely destroy our liberties and our economy by regulating whatever they want and because the EPA is subject to political pressure, we would basically be open to tyranny. Which leads me to my next point.

I stated that if the government has too little power over the environment, we are screwed and if it has too much power, we are screwed. So where does that leave us? If we were to not have the EPA and instead made clean air, water, and land issues of private property, then we would be solving problems more efficiently. If an organization like Consumer Reports were to have done a study on the negative effects of leaded gasoline, then someone could sue the companies involved and leaded gasoline would have been eliminated in less time than it took the EPA due to political pressure. Sure, a system like this is not perfect, but unlike what we have now, it is not vulnerable to political pressure, which I feel is quite dangerous. Users/hankim

20100310 11:42:24 nbsp Taxes were not the only reason. You did say that I should talk to business owners for my sources so I gave my anecdotal evidence as well. And just because the cost of living is high somewhere does not mean the quality of workers is high as well. I am sure you could find plenty of qualified engineers in Nevada.

Think about it, if you were a car company and you could have the government pass a law that forces everyone who buys your product to buy something that you only had as an option, would you not support it? If it took car companies decades to realized that safety features made cars more appealing, why did Ford provide seat belts as an option almost twenty years before seat belts were required by law? And Saab even had seat belts come standard as well before the law.

I am saying that whichever path you take with the EPA, there will be too many negative side effects. The problem with the EPA is that it is basically run by politicians and any government agency (no matter how it starts) will become like that. Even environmentalists have criticized the EPA because it has more policy makers than scientists.

What you are referring to is the tragedy of the commons which does occur if there are no property rights assigned to things such as clean air which I did address.

I am not saying that everyone should walk around in fear. I am saying whenever someone disconnected from you says they are doing something for your good, you should be wary because they probably do not know enough about you to make the best decisions and it is best if individuals are left to make decisions for themselves.  Users/hankim

20100310 13:19:39 nbsp I gave you an example of where the EPA failed where you said they succeeded. Even for emissions right now, their actions are based on whoever is in charge of the branches of government. The EPA has not done good things in a timely manner in my opinion.

Unless someone had a patent on seatbelts, its not going to be difficult for everyone else to start adding seatbelts once they see demand go up. Heck, if the demand is high enough, manufacturers would probably pay to use seatbelts. I gave examples of Ford and Saab providing seat belts without government intervention because it shows that the market ups the safety standards way before the government does and basically the government only creates a floor that is a nuisance to free choice. Maybe some people value price and better miles per gallon over safety (especially if someone wanted a car to only drive locally, there is also an argument here for SUVs and such), but thanks to government intervention, people are unable to choose. People who want safety features in their cars will buy cars with them and use them. Does the government really need to protect people from themselves if they believe that in certain circumstances that they do not need them?

With current communication technology, companies interact with each other all over the world without too much trouble. Distance being a barrier to communication and interaction is pretty much meaningless now. And of course tourism is going to go down when peoples wallets are thinner, but that does not mean companies are not moving away from California.  Users/hankim

20100614 19:38:03 nbsp By the way, my edit comment on Segundo isnt directed at you specifically.  The tag and move on editing always irks me a bit when its easy to look up, but you dont tend to do it.  When I looked back at the RC, it came off much more harsh than I intended.  Sorry for any offense. Users/JabberWokky

20100614 21:06:17 nbsp Yup  thats why it wasnt personal.  I found it by Google  something like UC Davis University Construction Segundo.  The link I found is in the text. Users/JabberWokky

20100616 21:22:26 nbsp Yeah, me too.  I only went to Thai Dynamite once or twice (and really liked it), but now its something else.  Then theres the new place, which I havent been to, and another place that is coming in... I mean I love Thai food but this is crazy! Users/CovertProfessor

20100616 21:36:27 nbsp I really liked 2k Thai, Thai 2K (whatever) when I first moved here.  But then it seemed to go downhill, and became my least favorite Thai restaurant in Davis.  And based on what Ive heard about KetMoRee, things seem to have gotten worse and I am just not motivated to check them out.  Id rather go to Nakorn or Thai Bistro or Sophias.  And yeah, I doubt Davis can support that many Thai restaurants.  I wish I were confident that the best always win, but my experience says that that isnt true.  Users/CovertProfessor

20110613 22:45:53 nbsp Dear IDoNotExist,

A year and a half ago, you accepted my challenge to a nerd duel.  I have tried to locate you ever since for said duel, but to no avail due to the fact that you do not exist.  As such, I am forced to forfeit the match.  You win the nerd duel.  The person who is nerdier than the woman formerly known as Karina Summers does not exist.  By a small logical leap, we see that I am, in fact, THE NERDIEST.

Rock on. Users/KarinaSummers

   This is not a pie.  Users/IDoNotExist
   The pie is a lie.  Users/TomGarberson
   Uneasy lies the head that wears a pie.  Users/IDoNotExist
   A pie ceases to be a pie the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a very large and flat cupcake.  Users/JabberWokky
   The great enemy of the dinner is very often not the pie, deliberate, contrived and baked, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and low in calories.  Users/IDoNotExist

20111103 18:02:37 nbsp Theres a lot to consider politically about GM foods but people need to stop being so afraid of the science behind them.  When it comes down to it, barring some huge natural disaster, we are going to need this tech someday.  If the world population keeps increasing exponentially, maybe not tomorrow or even 100 years from now, but eventually were going to need to grow food in places it wont want to grow and make it nutritionally complete.  This is going to make GM essential.  Right now its just a fun scifi story but it could be reality generations down the road.  I want to help people be a little less afraid of the science.  Nothing depresses me more than someone who is anti GMO proclaiming they dont want DNA in their food.  Facepalm   Users/OliviaY

20111104 19:51:50 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/OliviaY?actiondiff&at_date1320392919.6120501 Really?  Which of my arguments against GMOs were not based on science?  I am really, really getting tired of being portrayed as antiscience or ignorant about science, when I am neither.  I support (believe in, want to see study of and funding for) evolution, global warming, stem cell research, the space program, even cloning.  Not GMOs.  There are too many concerns about the potential impacts on humans and other species.  And whether those impacts are acceptable is not purely a question of science, no matter what anyone says.
