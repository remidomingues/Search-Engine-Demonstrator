The http://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/about/igps.html IGPS panel will be on Saturday April 23, 2011 from 11:301:00pm.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently (Jan 18, 2011) required all grant proposals to include a data management plan.  Depending on the research field, NSF’s new rules may require drastic changes in the way research is done and results disseminated. Researchers, librarians and institutions are busy figuring out what the new requirement means and how it is going to affect the way they do and share NSFfunded research. Researchers may have to start organizing and sharing their data in openly accessible Internet databases, librarians may have to develop and host the databases, and research institutions will be responsible for promoting, supporting, enforcing, and funding the new data management plans.

The Davis Open Science group will host a panel of five to seven experts including researchers, funding agency representatives, librarians, open data advocates, and journal editors. The panel will include graduate students from different disciplines. Panelists will be selected to include individuals most familiar with the new rules, individuals who are most directly affected by the new rules, and individuals with diverse opinions on the subject. Two facilitators from the Davis Open Science group will be in charge of receiving questions from the audience and help develop the dialogue among panelists, and between panelists and the audience.

The discussion will touch on topics ranging from the reasons behind the new policy, researchers’ responsibilities, what the libraries are doing about managing data, where the data should be deposited, to how this will change the way we do science. The panelists will clarify the new policy, and discuss the wider implications for the impact of research. We hope for a lively discussion on the new open data ideas in governmental agencies and academia.

A followup workshop will be held by Davis Open Science and the Physical Sciences and Engineering Library to teach attendees tools and methods to comply with the new data sharing standards.
