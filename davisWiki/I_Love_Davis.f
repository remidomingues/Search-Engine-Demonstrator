20050614 00:58:16 nbsp Where else could I major in Nature and Culture while still embracing my aggie roots? Users/CindySperry

20050614 00:58:28 nbsp Its pages like these that make me hate Davis. SS

20050614 01:01:45 nbsp Ok, I will start. I dont even live here but I love Davis! I love the Davis Food Coop Coop, I love Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks and Pita Pit because theyre open til like 3am and that blows my mind! I love the downtown area because its pedestrianfriendly, people can walk and bike anywhere. Coming from Vacaville Cowtown it really shows me how nice a little town can truly be. Plus we have this wiki! And you crazy people just love your cows. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050614 01:02:46 nbsp Aww come on Saul! Users/MichelleAccurso

20050614 08:41:10 nbsp Nugget! Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050614 09:56:18 nbsp Yeah, Nugget! And Joel at the Education Abroad Center.  And my boss April at Orchard Park.  And Users/MiriamKaufman Wombat and Users/MariaMaria Panda.  Yeah, and Pootleberry Dinglehopper Poot, G Street Pub and Davis Food CoOp. Thats why I love Davis. Users/SummerSong

20050614 13:36:00 nbsp That which makes Davis rux0r  Davis rux0r++: meat market, Pootleberry Dinglehopper, Nugget, Users/ArlenAbraham, The California Aggie, Rob Roy, Taqueria Guadalajara, Tipsy Taxi, Death Star Users/MichaelGiardina

20050614 15:31:47 nbsp The postman says hello when Im in the yard and he brings our mail! My friend in New York cant believe it. Users/AlphaDog

20050614 18:39:47 nbsp It may have been meant sarcastically, but taking things off the list because you dont like them seems ridiculous. I had a born and raised Davisite coworker that loved The Graduate the Grad, and Users/TracyPerkins someone on the wiki lists Pinkadot as one of their favorite Davis locations. Also, why did the Wooz go away? As a kid I loved visiting family in Sac cause sometimes we could convince my mom to stop there. Users/AmeliaCarlson

20050614 22:50:25 nbsp Oh I dont know, I deleted what I thought was a joke, I reverted and took off what was added last.... Eh put them back up, whatever. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050615 19:35:50 nbsp I love community events like the 4th of July celebration at Community Park, Celebrate Davis! (also at Community Park), the farmers market and the small town feel.  Users/JenniferChu

20050618 03:05:29 nbsp Davis has the Coop, which feels a little bit like Cheers. Users/EllenSeeley

20050618 22:03:21 nbsp I love Davis because I can wander around town wearing a cape and horns and become wellknown and even respected for it. Users/BarnabasTruman

20050803 12:06:20 nbsp I was inspired by the crows, so I made some Teeshirts. http://www.FlickerPictures.com/shop.htm Check them out when you have the chance. :) Users/JeffPalmer

20050804 14:26:00 nbsp you can order things at the Coffee House made with locallygrown, organic tomatoes from the Student Farm Users/ArlenAbraham

20050824 18:15:42 nbsp its often Davis In The Media in the media Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20050909 21:45:47 nbsp I love Davisville because of its flatness. My beach cruiser is happy. Users/DamonCline

20050926 21:06:38 nbsp of Smooth As Silk Day Spa Users/BriannaGarcia

20051010 22:39:33 nbsp I grew up in a town that consisted of miles and miles of suburban homes and strip malls crammed with chain stores. I love Davis for not being that.  Users/AnnaJones

20051011 20:21:55 nbsp Stevenson Bridge and The Jagged Tree both make me happy. Users/AlexPomeranz

20051029 16:50:45 nbsp Davis just feels so good.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20051029 16:57:15 nbsp Its so little and everybody rocks, even when people do not know you, they stop and chill! Users/JohnDudek

20051123 06:29:19 nbsp There are trees. Lots of really pretty trees. Thats why I love Davis, :D Users/ChristyMarsden

20051213 12:15:28 nbsp I absolutely love Davis. There is nowhere else Id rather be right now. Hip places like the Delta of Venus Delta and Cafe Roma Roma, hip people that dig music, art, and life. Bopping to KDVS. DavisWiki. Spacious, beautiful campus; trees, grass, arboretum, you can see the stars at night. I love riding my bike, riding the bus, walking the streets, nursing a cup, seeing old faces, meeting new faces. Picnic Day and Whole Earth Festival Whole Earth. I love Davis. Users/BrianAng

20061128 21:51:16 nbsp It is environmentally friendly and innovative. Users/TheBigGreen

20070105 02:27:37 nbsp Im immune to the typical Davis boredom so many people complain about! Users/StevenDaubert

20070105 02:27:56 nbsp plus its a great place to raisie a family Users/StevenDaubert

20070427 09:59:37 nbsp I love Davis because of the smalltown feel you can still get sometimes, for instance when reading yesterdays Davis Enterprise Briefly section, and finding the headline Firefighters Save Stranded Duckling Users/EdHenn

  Its exactly that sort of thing that makes me want to run away screaming. Users/CovertProfessor
   Sure, but with the correct perspective, it becomes free entertainment! Users/EdHenn
    Good point.  Ok, I will work on my attitude adjustment. Users/CovertProfessor
  I agree with Ed and its a rare month when someone I know doesnt have their photo in the Davis Enterprise emptyprize. Users/rocksanddirt

20071012 00:02:08 nbsp lots of young persons, citizens who think, trees, open space, the central park, threading through people on your bike, the university Users/RonB

20071012 11:30:51 nbsp Celebration of art and whimsy. Users/JabberWokky

20071014 19:54:03 nbsp There should be a link to Davis is Burning for events.   Users/BreeButler

20080128 22:54:39 nbsp I love the T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove Redwood Grove in the Arboretum. If I didnt know any better, Id swear that time slows when youre in there. Users/DukeMcAdow

20080429 15:21:00 nbsp I concur, the Redwood grove was my favorite place to study while at UCD in the early 90s.  Since then it has been improved with the addition of more ferns and some walk outs but at the same time it stays the same.  The Redwood seems to create such a magical feeling for me and its still my favorite part of town. Users/loneshark

20090506 10:40:07 nbsp Its true!  The Davis Food Coop Food Coop does feel like Cheers! Really, all of downtown does, too.  Users/Angel.York

20090816 02:30:48 nbsp Davis has a low crime rate, it has a good hometown feel, and the best part is the University. Other than that, not much. Users/IdealParadigm

20090816 03:04:10 nbsp Our high student suicide rate??? \ Users/ThUn

20091102 18:54:56 nbsp its not Beijing. I miss you Davis! Users/jsbmeb

20100103 13:39:26 nbsp I live here. :|
No really. Do I need a better reason? I didnt even realize how special it was until I was 18 and figured Id make use of my legal freedom. Between going to school in Fairfield and a bit of world traveling, Ive found that even the places Ive come to like I like because theyre like Davis.
Its a foodies paradise... if Im in the mood for it, I can find it without breaking the bank or even having to drive.
Its geekfriendly. Just look at what Im doing here and now.
Its safe for diversity. I have no fear of expressing myself on any level in public (because I know there are odder folks about?)
Its safe for sleepwalking. In the words of beloved Victor Borge, When you go home, please drive home extremely carefully. Extremely carefully. Because I walk in my sleep!

That should pretty much cover it. :> Users/KBathory

20100524 20:27:24 nbsp Love the Davis Food Coop, the Arboretum, Farmers Market... but last time I checked, a lot of people really dont like The California Aggie The Aggie and the people who work at Pinkadot represent everything the town of Davis does not want to be, but this page is way too subjective for everyone to individually edit what they think is or is not something to love...
