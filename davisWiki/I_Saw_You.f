Sometimes you cross paths with someone who attracts you—platonically, intellectually, romantically—but you havent any means of discovering who they are, other than by chance reencounter. This page is an outlet for disclosing attraction and increasing the odds, however slight, of discovery. See this http://alibi.selectalternatives.com/gyrobase/Personals/ISawYou page for examples of how this type of exchange is routinely handled. This is NOT like Craigslist Craigslists missed connections. Its for starry eyed romantics, not one night stands.
