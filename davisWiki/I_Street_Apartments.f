20050831 12:34:32 nbsp I live at one of the I St Apts (more like minitownhouse) and I must assume that the units at 419 are vastly different from the ones at 401403 because I dont see a pool or any sun decks.  It is pretty quiet, however, except for the train next door and the noise from the Ace rockyard.  Otherwise, not bad. Users/IrenePark

20070825 21:40:08 nbsp I lived in the complex from 419 from Jan till June of 2007. Really didnt care for not having a pool and such. But I think Managment has not showed interest in remodeling this complex because for the time i lived there. The halls were in complete darkness and not until there was an incident with a man trying to break in into an apt while everyone were there(only girls lived there) they didnt fix the lightbulbs. The Laundry room sucks. Theres only 1dryer and 1washer for 10 Units! Miserable! And personally my unit had a lot of things to get fixed, and not all of them got repaired.
If you happen to move in to this complex, make sure everything in your unit is ok and working properly Users/crisdavis20

20090606 10:22:22 nbsp There is actually a pool, but not on site. I St. residents (40103 and 419) are allowed access to the University Square pool and BBQ area, as they are owned by the same people. Users/Izza

20110324 14:38:20 nbsp My time at I Street is coming to a close, but living here has been fantastic. Donna and Josh are super nice and fairly responsive to any repair needs. The two story town houses are small, but have lots of storage. Really great for two people. You are within walking distance of everywhere in dwntn Davis. However, because this is a downtown location it is not a quiet site: the train, ACE, road noise, loud undergraduate neighbors. However, the doublepaned windows recently installed makes all the difference. Rent is low, so are utilities. Highly recommend! Im going to miss it here. Users/UnionME
