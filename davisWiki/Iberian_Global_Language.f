Created as a universal language by local Davisite Russell Blair, Iberian Matrix is a hybrid of two of the top six languages: Portuguese and Spanish. Spanish Matrix is a simplified version of Spanish language. The world has 200 million Portuguese speakers and 400 million Spanish speakers. These 600 million people are a huge base, for whom Iberian Matrix and/or Spanish Matrix language will be acquired very easily. They are the bedrock on which the growth of Iberian Matrix & Spanish Matrix languages is planned to be built.

Against the general desire for a global language (lingua franca), there is a reluctance to commit the time and effort necessary to learn any proposed language, unless the proposed language shows three things: 1) that it is relatively easy to learn,  2) that the beneÔ¨Åts of knowing the language exceed the costs of learning it, and 3) that it is backed by an established organization with the resources to support its growth.

Russell has written books that are available as free downloads from his websites which explain how Iberian Matrix and Spanish Matrix languages can meet these three criteria for surpassing English and becoming the global language.

In a blog post on July 18th, 2009, he noted that Davis had not had many people interested in the language and that he was moving his focus to wiki:Berkeley.
