 UCD Ice Hockey 
Davis fans of the hockey are very fortunate, as UC Davis boasts a very competitive mens ice hockey club (there is one woman on the team as well).  The http://sportclubs.ucdavis.edu/icehockey/ UC Davis Ice Hockey team is comprised of undergraduate and graduate students of the university, and is usually coached by UCD alum as well.  UCDs home arena is the http://www.vacavilleicesports.com/ Vacaville Skating Center (Davis St. exit on I80 West, about 25 minutes from Davis) and games are played on one of two rinks, which differ in seating (cold hard bleachers) configuration.  The Aggies compete in the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association (PCHA) and the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA).  Past oppononents have included UC San Diego, CSU Fresno, and UC Berkeley UC Berkeley.

Play begins in early October and ends in February, and home games are possibly the best bargains for any athletics event: a reg card Reg Card gets you in for $2.00, and regular admission isnt much more.  Games last at least two hours.  Full body contact is allowed, and on rare occasions, fans are treated to a goodspirited, classic hockey fight.  Its real, fullout ice hockey, and beats driving all the way down to San Jose.  Plus you get to root for the Aggies!

 Professional Teams 
For professional ice hockey, there is none other than the http://www.sanjosesharks.com San Jose Sharks, one of the top teams in the National Hockey League.  Unfortunately, it is in San Jose and it is the NHL, and an outing plus tickets can throw quite a bit on that credit card balance.  But when has that stopped a hockey fan?

In fall 2005, the http://www.stocktonthunder.com/Home/ Stockton Thunder will join the East Coast Hockey League, the hockey version of AA minors.  Travel distance and cost should be cheaper than a Sharks game, and the Thunder will play in a brand new arena.  But remember, the Aggies are even less expensive and a lot more fun!

 Playing 
Opportunities to play ice hockey are few and far between in this region of northern California, in case you arent much of a watcher but love to lace up the skates and play. The Aggies home rink at Vacaville has a schedule of stickandpuck and pickup times that doesnt tend to work well for a student or working schedule, for example. There is an ice rink in Roseville, http://www.skatetownroseville.com/index1.html Skatetown, that has a better schedule for this, and has full sized ice as well. This rink also supports an adult Learn to Play Hockey program that will start you out from scratch if youve never played before and teach you the basics, and an adult hockey league with various leagues divided by skill level ranging from complete newbies to former Junior A and Division I college players. The ice is a little soft, though.
