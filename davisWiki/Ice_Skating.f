Want to go ice skating in Davis?  Tough patooties.  Like various snow sports, there just isnt any ice skating to be done in town.  Unless youve got a really big freezer, youre going to have to travel a little bit.

Downtown Ice Rink

The downtown rink is put on by Westfield, the big downtown mall.  Its located at the corner of 7th and K Streets, at the east end of the Downtown Plaza.  It opens annually in early November and closes midJanuary.  All skill levels show up, from beginners to Olympians.  They see around 15,000 skaters each season.  Prices as of the 20092010 season were $6 admission and $2 skate rentals.  Skates can sometimes be fairly shoddy, so you may have to trade in the ones you get for something a bit better.  They periodically call everyone off the ice to refreeze it and smooth it out, since temperatures are typically above freezing in downtown Sacramento.

Getting there is easy.  Take 80/50, stay on 50 into Sacramento, hop on I5 Northbound, and exit J street.  Go straight up J a couple blocks and hang a right on 7th.  Youre there!  Theres a cityowned parking garage entrance on the right.  Parking is $1.50 each 1/2 hour, but you can get your parking validated at any store in the mall (try the Macys just across the street from the rink).  Validation makes the first 3 hours in the lot free (and it might make you feel better about yourself), and you dont have to buy anything (at least at Macys) to get validated.  The ice rink may or may not validate.  Its also right on wiki:sacramento Sacramento Regional Transit regional transit lines, and only 4 or 5 blocks from the downtown Amtrak station.

If youre looking for a bite to eat, the rink basically sits on the patio of a very tasty, pretty new (2011) Mexican food Mexican restaurant called wiki:sacramento Antigua Cantina & Grill.  The owners extremely nice, the prices are reasonable, and the food is great.  Try a chimichanga or, if you just want an appetizer, the excellent ceviche.  Theres also a Subway, a little dive bar, and an Afghan restaurant just across J Street between 7th and 8th.  On 8th, just north of J, you can also find wiki:sacramento La Bonne Soup, a famous little hole in the wall that does gourmet soups and sandwiches.  Its also only about 2 blocks to Pyramid Alehouse, just east on K Streetbe aware, though, that its not the nicest part of town, so you might not want to make the walk at night.  If you are headed that way after dark, walk on J Street instead.

 On Wednesday, November 2, 2011, Im watching a Zamboni out the window putting a nice finish on the first layer of ice.  Its odd seeing a Zamboni cruising around downtown Sacramento when its over 70 degrees out, but I assume this means the rink will be open by the weekend, if not before.  Its been interesting watching them put it together.  They shut down a portion of the alley on the north side of the little square to store their equipment.  Most days it looked like only 13 people were working on setting it up.  I didnt pay close attention, but it looked like they marked the borders, laid down sheets of plastic, added the fence directly around the rink, then the ornamented fence around the edge, then put down whatever system of sheets they use to keep the ice frozen.  They hang strands of lights across the square, and have a couple of freestanding flood lights that they use to light it at night.  And as I type this, the guy in the Zamboni is doing donuts on the rink.  Fun stuff! Users/TomGarberson

In addition to the Downtown Plaza Ice Rink, Sacramento used to have an outdoor rink in Midtown at 1050 20th St. from November through January.  Admission was $8 for adults and $5 for children, and skate rentals were $2.  Its last season of operation was 20092010.
