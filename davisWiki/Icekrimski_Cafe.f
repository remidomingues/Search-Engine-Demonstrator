A Gelato and Candy shop, now serving bulk and gourmet candies and hot chocolate. On their opening day their computer system was down  resulting in free gelato for all!  It has a window into the Varsity Theatre as well as a regular storefront.  The cafe is owned by Sinisa Novakovic, who also owns Mishkas Cafe and coowns the Varsity with Users/JonFenske

This cafe serves Caffe Classico Gelato (dairy) and Sorbetto (nondairy).  Both are also available at some local grocery stores.


The smallest size gelato costs $3.15 and the larger size increases the cost by a dollar ($4.15, $5.15),  it used to cost an extra $0.50 if you bought it through the theatre but that fee no longer exists.

The walls are painted concrete, and as a result, voices echo loudly and the acoustics are poor inside the small store space.
I havent noticed this, and the walls have some sort of plaster sprayed on them for the texture  Users/StevenDaubert
Now that we sell candy weve got shelves and candy jars all over the walls that help with the acoustics of the shop. Users/MeganYourFace


   Gotta love ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!


20060724 23:55:19 nbsp Excellent gelato! Finally someone opened a gelato shop in Davis. And in time for the heat wave too. The only nagging question is: what new flavors are they planning for the second cooler? P.S. hazlenut chocolate... mmm... Users/LiRic
  Gelato has been available in Davis for more than a decade I believe. Konditorei in East Davis not only has baked goods but a glass case of gelato. It would be interesting to hear how the two locations compare in quality. KJM
     Yes, Konditorei has had gelato for a while now. Unfortunately their paltry number of flavors hardly qualifies them to be Davis sole gelato store. I would soonerand dogo to Berkeley for gelato than eat the gelato at Konditorei. Thank goodness Icekrimski Cafe opened. How much is the gelato at Konditorei? I never bothered to check.
   Zias sells gelato...
     Is the gelato at Zias any good? I forgot that they had it until you mentioned it. I think I remember that they only had a few unspecial flavors, though. I think I shouldve specified that its good to finally have a dedicated gelato store in Davis. BTW, thanks to whoever it was who posted pics. Its good to see that they stocked their second cooler.
      No problemo... I was standing there today, and my camera was in my pocket, and I thought, oh duh! I am visible in the reflection in the upper right pic. KJM
     Zias has been selling Gelato Classico brand for over a year now. Same great taste as here, and they seem to change flavors often. They also sell pints in another freezer. Any idea if you can get pints here?
        Does gelato taste good when brought home? If anyones ever bought a pint, is it hard to keep soft? Do you need to lower your fridge temperature?
           The Gelato is happiest at 5 to 9 degrees. But a freezer will do, just keep it away from the walls. The optimal consistency is of thick peanut butter.  Users/StevenDaubert

20060726 14:55:13 nbsp Gelato is wonderful stuff.  Should this be the Gelatski Cafe? Users/JaimeRaba

20060727 17:14:37 nbsp Computer system down  free gelato?? What, so before computers were invented there were no monetary transactions anywhere? Are people that bad at math? Users/BarnabasTruman
  They also were not told the prices for the Gelato sizes on the first day, so it turned into an impromptu promotional freebie.  KJM
  Oh well, I guess I shouldnt be complaining about free ice cream. :)  Users/BarnabasTruman

20060728 21:06:54 nbsp Score! The management likes Apple products, I guess. On opening night, there was a Mac mini and now theres a Bose Sounddock for the iPod. Props to the owner. Users/LiRic

A few plants strategically placed in the corners would help with the excessive echoing, along with acoustic tile on the ceiling to break up the standing waves. Users/KarlMogel

20060731 23:31:57 nbsp I think they have fancy ice cream there too, which is really tasty. I got the dulce de leche. Yummie, :D. Theyre very nice, its good to see theyre busy! Users/ChristyMarsden

20060823 13:20:10 nbsp As an ice cream guru here is the skinny... the gelato is YUMMY!  wonderful!  I love it!  It is the same brand they sell at Zias but Zias isnt open at night.  They also sell pints of it at the Coop. the ice cream is double rainbow brand and is tasty. Also pints at the Coop. The shop is really well placed and done.  I really like the community it adds to downtown.  Another great reason to walk around and mingle the people on the planet you live with. Thanks for opening a great new hang out for ice cream in downtown!!   Users/HeatherMartin

20070228 23:53:35 nbsp A foodie told me that dots you see in the vanilla bean and the double espresso bean shows that it comes from real beans, not extracts. Users/StevenDaubert

2007314 I just stopped by here for the first time tonight, and it made my evening. I didnt have cash when I walked in (they only take cash), but after a few samples I rode my bike to the bank to get money. Yeah, thats how good it was. The fruit flavors tasted EXACTLY like the fruit theyre named after (tangerine, mango, lemon, coconut). Reminds me of France. And the chocolate flavors (chocolate mint, chocolate hazlenut, chocolate malt) were so rich and perfect. Reminds me of Italy. I love trying new and slightly strange things, so I LOVED the ginger flavor (try it!) and the blackberry cabernet sorbetto. Wow. Red wine flavored sorbet. Why didnt they think of that sooner? It tasted like a luscious grownup popsicle. So I guess what Im trying to say is that you really should try this place. Just remember to bring cash! Users/MareGiudice

20070322 16:16:15 nbsp I love gelato so I decided to try this place. It looks nice and the variety of flavors were okay not that great. Pricing was a little steep for me compared to the gelato stores I went to in the Bay Area. It was decent gelato but not the best. Customer service was terrible, the server kept avoiding me and my friend (guess he didnt like Asians). Basically wanted us out quickly and didnt even offer samples to us. From this I wouldnt come back here as often.  Users/BrandonToo

   Any evidence for that charge of racism?  Users/JimEvans
   I assume the idea is that he and his friend are both Asian. Not much evidence, I agree, but there you are.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Just seemed that the server didnt want to serve my friend and I. The group before us were treated very nicely but when it came to us he acted like we didnt belong there. We didnt even do anything but smile and greet him. Then a group of guys come around and immediately the server greeted them in a friendly manner and asked them if they wanted any samples. He actually avoided us until I asked him what I wanted. Simply stated I had a bad experience here. And a sidenote is that both groups before and after us were white people so of course it would feel strange as to why we were not treated the same way.  Users/BrandonToo

20070324 23:21:49 nbsp Stumbled upon Icekrimski the other night, had a very pleasant experience.  The two brunettes working were swamped but still able to greet each customer and serve them with efficiency and smiles.  The Gelato was fantastic, Im definatley going to be a regular! Users/JacobWright

20070423 09:47:13 nbsp Great place. Im glad they got rid of the Ice Cream it wasnt needed.
Hope everybody has a chance to try it I will definately be back. Users/KevinRobinson


20070429 18:50:33 nbsp Icekrimskis has really yummy gelato! I went to a huge gelato place several months ago in my hometown of Los Angeles. This place was in the Santa Monica Promenade, and had like a hundred flavors! Still, no matter how many flavors this place had, their gelato was not awesome, and totally paled in comparison to Icekrimski.

20070430 17:51:38 nbsp The Pumpkin flavor is simply wonderful. Try it, folks. Users/KarlMogel
  indeed Karl, did you enjoy the nutmeg and the cinnamon at the end to give just a hint of pumpkin pieness?  Users/StevenDaubert

20070506 14:49:06 nbsp With a ton of unique and wonderful options to chose from and the opportunity to sample the most tempting morsels, this is a must try spot in Davis.  The staff is funny and very attentive.  Stopping here leaves a pleasant smile on customers faces with a hint of nutmeg! Users/RachelRagatz

20070519 18:57:58 nbsp When getting gelato tonight there were two people working but only one was actually helping customers.  The guy just sat there talking to friends, I assume, while the girl had to help everyone.  I kept expecting him to stand up and help us, but we ended having to wait a while for the girl to help everyone before us. I dont know if he was on a break or something, but i just thought it was really rude that he wasnt helping her. When we finally got our gelato, it was delicious, just wish the service was more professional.  Users/JoyChu

20070522 07:12:49 nbsp My friend and I went there yesterday. Pretty friendly place. Daubert gave us a lot of samples. Try the tiramisu , dulce de leche or caramello chocolate crunch gelato. I also like mixing the mango sorbetto with any of the fruit flavors. Great service, great gelato! Users/JonasMari

20070523 11:32:48 nbsp yes, as a frequent patron at icekrimski, the blonde guy who works there is very friendly (when he is the only one there); however, it seems like whenever there are two people working, he lets the other person do all the work (i know because i have seen it on more than one occasion, and my friends who come there can verify it as well). i dont mean to cause controversy, but i just call it like i see it. Users/JoyChu

20070524 21:25:33 nbsp Went here today for the first time.  There was only one girl working there, and it wasnt busy at all, so the service was prompt and attentive.  We tried a couple of samples and then I settled on the cherry gelato that had plenty of cherry chunks in it.  It was very good, and I thought the portion size was decent for the price.  My fiancee had half strawberry, half something with a weird name that was effectively cookies and cream.  She was very pleased as well. Users/AlexPomeranz
    Stracciatella?  Users/StevenDaubert
         It was a strange word like that.  Wikipedias definition for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stracciatella Stracciatella says it can be Vanilla ice cream with chocolate shavings.  Could have been. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070527 17:06:03 nbsp This place is awesome. Come here next time you have a frozen dairy craving. The employees are very friendly and the gelato is excellent. Users/AmitVainsencher

20070528 17:46:35 nbsp I finally went here for the lemon gelato, it was very good but seemingly not the best Ive had (thought its been a while).  Ill have my dad stop by to check it out, he raves about lemon gelato from his old neighborhood in the Bronx. Users/EdHenn

20070608 00:59:14 nbsp Always great service. Always delicious gelato. :) Users/CAkita

20070611 09:42:24 nbsp The gelato here is really good, and refreshing on a hot day.  (So, refreshing just about every day??).  Try the sorbet  its intensely flavored and will knock your socks off.  (Which you dont need anyway, since its so darned hot...) Users/CovertProfessor

20070712 14:34:49 nbsp Im a relatively frequent customer at Icekrimski (I go there about once a week), and its quite tasty.  The mango and guava sorbettos are amazing, and the child size is sufficient simply because of the amount of flavor that it packs.  Of the gelato flavors, Id probably recommend the creme brulee or the hazelnut.  Yummy.

On another note, the service there varied depending on who was working.  The two younger employees (the blonde haired guy and a younger gal) have always been very courteous, but the older lady that was working there (with the useless guy that others have mentioned) wasnt very nice.  In fact, she seemed kind of pissed to serve me and my friends.  Maybe she was annoyed that we got excited over frozen treats. Users/BrianMac

20070929 19:57:04 nbsp I recommend getting a regular sized half mango, half passion fruit sorbetto. The flavors complement each other nicely.  Users/at86

20080201 17:28:41 nbsp does anyone else find it troubling that the employees here touch the cookie that goes into the ice cream, and touch your money, and everyone elses money, and do not wash their hands??  i believe that is a health code violation.  Users/Chantal

20080323 23:59:26 nbsp I like this place, they always pack you selected cup size full of the gelato. The pumpkin gelato is my favorite but another good combination is half chocolate and half banana fosterstastes just like the chocolate dipped frozen bananas from Disneyland.   Users/NtoWolves

20080523 10:50:28 nbsp Went here last night for the first time.  Pleasantly satisfied with service and delicious!  I had the Caramello Chocolate chrunch and the Strawberry Fresca.  The strawberry fresca was really good and my favorite of the two. Users/Jillep

20081021 14:04:21 nbsp Hella tasty.  I would recommend this place to anyone. Users/ChrisWaterstraat

20090124 22:35:51 nbsp They have excellent limoncello poppy seed gelato. However, their hours are kind of wonky. I went in today to get some of my favorite gelato, and they werent open. Their window had a sign posting that their hours were frisun 3:307:30. Pretty lame. I went to BOTH the coop and nugget market to see what flavors of classico they serve and was bummed to find that they pretty much only carried vanilla, tiramisu, a mango kind and maybe one or two others. This place definitely has the best selection, but make sure you go when they are actually open. I think that at least on the weekends, they should be open for longer. Users/BrookeB

20100716 17:20:33 nbsp This is the best gelato with a good atmosphere and location. A little expensive though, but worth it. Users/JasperD

20120127 13:55:29 nbsp Best gelato joint in town. Users/RoamingDavisite

20130106 18:48:20 nbsp They now accept credit and debit! Hooray! Users/ErinHollander

20130522 15:49:45 nbsp Bring back macadamia nut coconut!!! Users/Aaron.Curtin

20140509 02:46:29 nbsp The gelato has a wonderfully thick consistency and retains its flavour superbly, without the taste diminishing as you work your way through a serving. The mango is tart and fruity (like a chilly Gusher, but better!), and the honey lavender is sweet and tastes subtly like tea. Definitely allow the honey lavender the chance to perform its gentle work upon your tasting buds.  Users/JaniceW
