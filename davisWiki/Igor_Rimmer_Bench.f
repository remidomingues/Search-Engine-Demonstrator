The Igor Rimmer Memorials memorial Address(Benches bench, 38.56678, 121.75607) is located on the Covell Greenbelt between the paths leading to the west ends of Equador Place and Flamenco Place.  The plaque on the bench is from the http://web.archive.org/web/20040731012141/http://www.rimmerfoundation.org/  Rimmer Foundation, a nonprofit charitable foundation created in honor of the late Igor Rimmer (19561998), who was a champion of the rights of Jews living in the former Soviet Union. Rimmer grew up in eastern Russias http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast Jewish Autonomous Oblast and spent four years of his mid20s imprisoned in a Siberian Gulag.

The phrase Never Again is used by the Jewish Defense League to mean that, postHolocaust, http://www.jdl.org/index.php/ideologyadvocacy/coreideology/neveragain/ Jews will never again go quietly and submissively to their deaths, although the phrase is used by other Jewish groups, usually with the same or similar meaning.

  What do you find offensive about it?   Users/CovertProfessor

20100727 23:20:16 nbsp Maybe its the part about there being a time for Jews to die? I think the idea of anybody dying before their time is kind of silly, anybody could get hit by a bus or something. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Ive known a few people that are offended by the usage of the word Jews as mentioned on the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews#Name_and_etymology wikipedia page via an American Heritage dictionary quote: It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.  Ive known far more people who tend to be offended by the offense taken at the noun usage of Jew, as perfectly written in the quote above. users/edwins ES
   Exactly, ES  most Jews refer to themselves as Jews, as was no doubt the case for the writers of the plaque.  As for for being there a time for Jews to die  well, we all die.  That much is certain, unless someone finds a way to make humans immortal.  But we arent all the targets of deliberate attempts at annihilation  the phrase http://www.jdl.org/index.php/ideologyadvocacy/coreideology/neveragain/ never again suggests a reference to the Holocaust.  I dont know for sure how Igor Rimmer died, but thats my best educated guess.  (Evidently, my guess was wrong). Users/CovertProfessor

You were right. The reference in the phrase Never Again was to Holocaust
