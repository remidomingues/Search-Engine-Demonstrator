Illusions is a head shop, formerly the only one in Davis.  They sell a variety of goods including blacklight posters, incense, clothing stores clothing, jewelry body jewelry, tobacco accessories, hookahs (with tobacco and coals) and water pipes. They were called DZone Novelties and Dead Zone Novelties when they were located on B Street, between 2004 and 2009.

Please have your ID ready, the guy at the counter cards you if you appear younger than 18 years of age.

Originally, the owner intended to sell sex toys and ya know, DVDs, but the Davis Downtown Business Association and the City of Davis opposed it.

The owners Mike and Sam use members of the family as the employees; Sam has recently opened a head shop in Elk Grove.

Users/StevenDaubert SD  says that you should try and haggle with them as much as possible, its almost the best part of shopping there.

In November of 2009, Illusions started carrying vinyl records. They have experimental, house, trance, dj dance and some underground stuff. At $1 dollar each we cant go wrong. They are in the room with the pipes, on the floor, to the right.

20050609 15:10:13 nbsp Could someone post the law here, that says sex toys cannot be sold? Since when could the government prevent someone from selling large vibrating pieces of rubber. That seems ridiculous. Orgasms are bad for us! OMG! Noooo! People are experiencing pleassure! Sinners! Users/MichaelGiardina
 the revelant http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p40&q1944 city code? Doesnt seem to specifically address the issue.

20050609 15:14:47 nbsp I talked to the owner about it, and he said he voluntarily stopped selling them to stop the harassment by the Davis City Council. And yes, unfortunately cities can pass ordinanced regulating what is sold. Users/JimSchwab

20050609 15:18:51 nbsp So sad though. I mean if they tried to get him to stop selling pesticides that were labled Colored like candy to induce consumption by loud crying babies I could understand. But sex toys? Whos going to get hurt with a sex toy (unless of course they forget to take the blades out of the reciperocating saw prior to placing the rubber member on top) Users/MichaelGiardina

20070102 14:42:44 nbsp When asked the relation to the various people working, Mike and Same are brothers, and occasionally he has one of his Uncles work, or a cousin etc. Users/StevenDaubert

20070122 18:43:49 nbsp Cool place, horrid glass selection (for northern california) but has plenty of other stuff... Some of the people that work here are cool, one guy gave me some free papers just cuz he sees me in there a lot, but others have been REALLY rude to me at times... It can be hit or miss...

20080621 18:07:18 nbsp We bought our pipe here and found the owner friendly and funny.  Users/Zeeba

20080621 18:12:09 nbsp Is it just me or does this place seem a bit pricey? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080825 12:24:19 nbsp Like most head shops, the sticker price should not be the price that you end up paying.... in fact it should be quite a lot higher than what you end up paying. Always haggle. The more you know about the item in question, the better deal youll get. These guys can be real sticklers, though. They will throw in cheap novelties like papers or glass screens to help the deal, but keep in mind these items are extraordinarily cheap.  Users/Chronoz

20081217 23:54:22 nbsp Does this place sell salvia? Users/AaronD
 Yeah they have Salvia, I think the highest X is 25 but I may be wrong....  Users/StevenDaubert

20090208 18:24:30 nbsp the salvia is absurdly overpriced and comes in packages too large for any one person to consume. if you can avoid this shop, do. if not, be very careful with the prices. the owner said one price and charged another on my visa. the whole store is a ripoff. Users/ericreed

20090322 12:38:57 nbsp Kind store right there. Competitively priced. Location Location Location. This is one to watch. :) Users/lilmonstu

20090514 17:10:42 nbsp Only headshop in Davis but there are a few in surrounding cities if you have a car. Expensive prices normally unless you know the owner, especially on glass merchandise. The sticker price is usually never what you want to pay for something. They have recently started selling cigarettes I guess in an effort to make the establishment seem more legitimate. However, since the cigarettes are in the front of the store, the whole thing is a smoke shop now down to the Jimi Hendrix posters and wide assortment of smoking supplies that is absurdly overpriced because they are the only place in town. I usually just buy coals here and I have to always ask for a specific 100 pack for $10 or else they will try to sell you a 10 pack of quick lites for $3. They sell a wide variety of clove cigarettes here, but the best price for Djarum Black is probably at the 76. For glassware, a roadtrip to San Francisco or Santa Cruz is highly recommended over this place as they insanely overprice the water pipes and chillums and pieces. Nice to go in every once in a while just to look over the stuff but not buy anything. Users/Andy890

20090515 19:07:02 nbsp do they sell whips it there? Users/rrkimble22

20090601 12:23:47 nbsp Word of advice. Do not waste your money purchasing a ROOR from this place. FAKE! FAKE ROORS! They claim to have these new German made ROOR pipes. The fact is, Illusions is NOT an authorized dealer for ROOR. The ROORs Illusions carries are shitty quality pipes most likely made in China or India. Just because it has a Made in Germany sticker doesnt mean shit. I am a glass connoisseur of sorts and these ROOR pieces are an abomination to a REAL German ROOR. The joint on these POS pieces are hair thin. German ROORs are known for their durability and quality because a 5mm pipe will have a 5mm joint. Whereas these inferior knockoffs have poorly built joints that WILL break on you easily. It sucks because my friend just emptied his pockets for his dream piece, only to have been swindled. I cannot believe how devious this shop can be at times. DONT BE FOOLED! Users/anoneyebee
     Unless you import your roor from roorshop.de its probably going to come from the la roor studio which was shut down, that being said Ive been watching deadzone for quite some time, they have no reason to do bad business like this, it just breeds more bad business. I call bullshit on your comment, for someone claiming to be a glass connoisseur with a taste for roors youve got some holes in your story. That being said I think its worth noticing that your not willing to put your name behind your claim so Im dubious of your whole story anyways.  Users/StevenDaubert
    Using the power of hindsight I realized I know someone who bought a blue label from deadzone and its as authentic as can be, should I take a picture of the blower mark and contact roor to see if its genuine?! Are all the PHX, ADS, JBD counterfeit? What about the Volcanos? Besides, If Im correct the area your talking about that broke is just below the female downstem, and its the one weak spot cause its added to the vessel. Im going to guess someone was careless and it was jarred, or the downstem was jostled and it snapped at the joint! As far as the joint not being 5mm I demand pics with a millimeter ruler...

20090718 15:24:13 nbsp The glassware at this store is mediocre at best in quality and ridiculously overpriced. Although the owner is open to haggling, getting 50% off on an inferior product still means you got ripped off. If you need supplies like screens, papers, and the like, by all means use this store. If youre looking for a quality piece, you are better off making a trip to the Bay Area. And for people who think his prices are competitive, who exactly is he competing with? Personal recommendation: Twilight Zone in Hayward. Avoid tourist traps in SF and Berkeley as well. Users/InigoM

20090907 18:57:18 nbsp Did these guys leave Davis?  Shop is empty and sign is gone... Users/jimtower
            Wow dude, you need to pay attention, LOL.  Note new address.DM

20091102 17:56:20 nbsp Illusions on 2nd and G St. now carries vinyl records.

They have experimental, house, trance, dj dance and some underground stuff.

At $1 dollar each we cant go wrong. They are in the room with the pipes, on the floor, to the right. Users/lilmonstu

20100207 16:58:38 nbsp Be careful what you buy here. I bought a very solidlooking, brandname bong from here and it was flimsy. It broke, and there was nothing the owner would do to help me out with it. My friend bought a different brandname bong from there not much later, which also cracked. Lowquality, overpriced pieces abound in this storeso choose carefully. This is just from my experience... but many (yes, MANY) others I have talked to have experienced similar upsetting discoveries.

I recommend having a little idea of what youre looking for and having an idea about what constitutes good merchandise and what doesnt before you go into this store, because the owner is a smooth talker and will tell you what you want to hear. Ive seen him sell weak or cheap pieces to customers for way more than their actual value, but heyits not my business to tell people what to buy. Anyway, go in there knowing about the product youre looking for and you will avoid being swindled. Personally Ive decided not to buy pieces there anymore, and just grab some hookah and incense instead.

I completely agree with InigoMs post.

And to comment on StevenDauberts comment... They dont have any reason to do GOOD business either, being that they are the only shop for this stuff in Davis. They have an iron grip on this kind of merchandise in the town, and know that regardless of their quality people will keep buying there. Just an thought. Either way, youre better off knowing about the products before you shop here.Users/Divided.Eye

20100330 15:07:33 nbsp hey could anyone tell me if they sell the fake nose studs? it says they sell body jewelery; just curious! Users/jmac

20100411 16:35:48 nbsp Im from the bay area, so i know some pretty good smoke shops. this isnt one of them. the glass selection here is terrible and overpriced. everything is super generic or ugly novelty pipes. the guys are your typical smoke shop goons who think of prices off the top of their heads, expecting you to possibly say no and lower the price. they are like wannabe smokeshop hustlers that never REALLY learned how to hustle people. i asked how much for a box of swishers, the guy said $40. the next day i went in to buy it for $40, his brother(?) said $45. what? the other guy said $40 yesterday, thats why i came in here
no, its $45
alright ill give you $45 flat or else im good
ok $45 flat is fine

a few days later my friend went there to get a box, i told him if the guy wouldnt take $45 flat or under, just walk out. he texted me 20 mins later i walked out. he would only take $50

my friend was gonna buy a downstem, but every peice they had was too long, and the guy wouldnt cut one shorter for him, said he couldnt do it. the next day he went in with his friend who bought a waterpipe, and they didnt have downstems short enough for it, so they cut one with a glass cutter right in front of him. my friend said hed never go back there again.

this is a wanna be smoke shop if you ask me. exactly what youd expect in davis.  Users/Jake510

20101009 02:34:22 nbsp I bought a pipe from them today, and they gave me a great deal. The guys knew i was a college student, and gave me a great price. The employees were very kind and helpful. Even though they are the only head shop in Davis, doesnt mean they want to take advantage of us. They know we are students and are willing to work with us for a good deal. They are nice people, I definitely recommend going to this store! Users/isabelnc

20101116 12:52:39 nbsp Purchased a new device there last week.  After going online to the manufacturer for better directions, I found that I had purchased the device for $30 less than it was available from the manufacturer.  Also, left my bank card there and they had it waiting for me when I returned later that day.  Honest guys, excellent prices. Users/ElisaAllechant

20110119 00:28:16 nbsp Anyone know if they sell butane for lighters? Users/MattBlair

20110419 20:57:30 nbsp @Jake510: you and your friends probably came in with stupid bad ass attitudes. If you come to this shop and are just friendly and dont look like a miscreant they hook you up with awesome deals. Users/MikeN

20110514 09:56:28 nbsp also @jake510 Ive lived in the Bay Area myself, and I choose to live in Davis now, as a resident, not a student or Alumni of UC.  Your comment seems pretty down on Davis exactly what youd expect in davis.  Maybe thats what YOUD expect, but I, and many others, think very highly of this town, and its smoke shop.  You create your own reality, so if you expect it to suck here, guess what?  It will.  Maybe we cant buy a decent sex toy here in Davis, but I personally dont want to buy my sex toys with a bunch of college students milling around, Id rather do it online with my boyfriend.  Illusions has always met my needs as an excellent smoke shop with good prices and excellent customer service, and I am not a 20something college student. Users/ElisaAllechant

20120223 19:13:00 nbsp Owners are awesome, but the prices are a bit high.  Users/CaroBaro

20120306 18:04:53 nbsp The guy that works here is great!! Super friendly, and will give you a good deal if you talk to him and discuss prices. Went in there wanting to spend less than $100 on a new piece, walked out spending $95 on a piece that was worth WELL over $120. He even threw in a nice looking bowl piece and a diffuser downstem! :) VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!  Users/MarganaSuendermann

20120311 19:06:22 nbsp Nice store, friendly employees, unfortunately the prices arent reasonable for a college student like myself. After my first visit here Ive been going to Roseville to get everything I need. Its closer than making a trip to the bay area, only about 3540 minutes depending on traffic. You guys should check out Blown Away and Smokers Haven which are both in Roseville. They have the best prices on hookahs, hookah tobbacco and accesories, smokes including cigars, grinders, pipes and practically everything you would need. Last time I went I paid $9 for a box (10 sleeves) of easy light hookah coals. Illusions sells the same ones for $20 for a box. Plus, if you show that youre a student at Davis (show them your school ID) at either of these two stores, they will give you an additional 10% off their already super low prices. Just cant get better than that. Users/MoeHirani

20120329 19:50:07 nbsp Good Service, good prices.  I went to sacramento and the prices there are outragous compared to illusions.  I ended up paying double for hookah shisha. Users/DavidHussman

20120803 12:37:32 nbsp THIS SHOP HAS GREAT PRICES! HIS PRICES ARE REASONABLE ON EVERYTHING! DEFINITELY A GOOD SHOP! Users/peejay

20130217 18:21:10 nbsp  I visited the shop looking at sheesha prices. I had bought tobacco at home and  had some idea of what I expected to pay, so my surprise was evident when the prices seemed  a bit steep. As I continued looking at their other products, the owner came to the counter and proceeded to berate me, arguing that his prices were the cheapest I would find, contrary to my past experience. The owner was forceful and threatening, and I left the shop when he began raising his voice insisting I use my smart phone to research prices. The salesman was surly, standoffish, and unfriendly, and didnt offer much in the way of customer service, though there was no one else in the shop to attend to. I did not feel as though my patronage was appreciated, and will not visit the shop in the future. I enjoy supporting local business, but from now on will shop online rather than visit Illusions again.  Users/TaylorWolzen
