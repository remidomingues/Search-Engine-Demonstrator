ImaginAsian is UCD Chi Delta Thetas annual AsianAmerican talent showcase. Up and coming performers from all over the bay, Sacramento area, as well as students of UCD are invited to perform. Part of the purpose of ImaginAsian is to broadcast the wide variety of AsianAmerican talents in the performing arts as well as to partake in philanthropy events for our community.
Each year the proceeds of ImaginAsian are donated to a charity of Chi Delta Thetas choice; this year we have chosen My Sisters House based in Sacramento.

Please come and help support our philanthropy and all the different organizations and groups that have come together for this showcase.

My Sisters House
My Sisters House is a nonprofit organization based in Sacramento, that identifies and addresses the unique needs of women and children impacted by domestic violence in the Asian and Pacific Islander community in the Central Valley.

Headliner: LEGACI
The New York Times gracefully calls them on a front page feature, “The most visible yet invisible pop figures in the entire world.” Known all over the world as Legaci, these 4 gentlemenhave been wowing audiences with their harmonies and vocal acrobats. Del, Jason, Chris and Micah all hail from Northern California and for years shared a passion to make music that moves people; And move people they did. Legaci’s claim to fame was through Youtube. With over 28 million views and counting, it was Legaci’s Youtube channel and their cover of Justin Bieber’s smash hit “Baby” that got Bieber and his manager’s attention. They were asked to tour with Justin and be his official backing group. Since then they’ve performed at over 100 shows across 30 different countries, and appeared in major media outlets including American Idol, Oprah, and Saturday Night Live just to name a few. Now the guys are ready to take center stage as they prepare to release an upcoming EP and prepare for their own world tour. Legaci is ready to build a Legacy!
