Impossible acres is a small family farms farm that has been growing a variety of fruits and vegetables for the past 6 years. We sell some of our produce to local stores such as the Davis Food Coop Davis Food Coop, but most of what we grow is sold directly to folks who come to the farm either to buy fresh produce or to pick their own. Some of the crops we grow are raspberries, boysenberries, blackberries, wiki:wikipedia:Olallieberry olallaberries, cherries, peaches, apricots, plums, apples, Pumpkins pumpkins and corn. We generally open in May and close at the end of October. They also sell jams made from their own fruits.


  UPick Rates and Information 
As of May 2009, here are the rates:

strawberries: $1.25/pound, cherries: $1.99/pound, peaches/apricots: $1.99/pound, marionberries/raspberries: $2.99/pound.

UPDATE:
As of 7 August 2010, raspberries are still $2.99/lb but peaches are $0.99/lb Users/MeganCleary

As of August 2010, dogs (preferably leashed) are allowed in the upick area.

This means that they are still cheaper than Safeway for some things, but not others. The quality, though, makes a real difference. Safeway orders unripe fruit and often ripens it artificially  while it looks ripe, it never reaches the high sugar content of truly ripe fruit (like you get at Impossible Acres). So while its amazingly tasty, its not quite as cheap as it used to be.

This farm has the best berries around.  If you pick them yourself, they are only $2/lb... in comparison to Safeway or Albertsons that charges like $3.99 for 6 oz. Great buy, and you can eat while you pick too!  I recommend the blackberries later in the summer, because they are huge. And, the raspberries are very yummy, but a bit harder to pick.

Check it out.... nearly 2lbs of raspberries, 40 minutes of picking (by myself) and only $3.75! YUM!

Harvesting Advice


It is a good idea to bring a bottle of water along, and also wear a hat and/or sunscreen. You can eat fruits as you pick them, and the most plentiful harvests can be found deep within the rows  where most people dont normally venture.


Raspberries  Most of the good berries are in the interior of the vines, amongst the thorns. Try using your harvesting box to push down and out on a few branches, opening up the foliage, exposing the bright red berries that were hidden before. Be sure to tug on the raspberries gently, as they are fragile, and are supposed to pop off of the coneshaped receptacle beneath the nowhollow berry. Using this method you can pick large volumes of fresh raspberries quickly, while minimizing skin punctures. Gloves that leave the fingertips exposed can help protect your hands while harvesting any thorny berry.

Blackberries  A close relative of raspberries, these do not pop off of their receptacles, so expect to tug a little harder to remove them. Fully black and soft berries will be sweet, but if you prefer tart blackberries, as Users/KarlMogel I do, pick them while the berries are still firm, even slightly reddish.

Cherries  These are available earlier in the year than the other fruits, and some years there can be very few. But fresh cherries are awesome, so dont forget to wander through the orchard  the basket above was picked in one hour in a bad year!


  Petting Zoo 
They have an awesome petting zoo during the month surrounding Halloween, with baby animals for kids and adults to cuddle with. Their kittens are up for adoptions after the petting zoo season is over (and the list filled up fast). You can get a season pass for the petting zoo area. Adult get in free with a kid! Older children can sign up to assist with chores during closing time.  The Petting Zoo and the surrounding pickapumpkin area are a popular destination for Schools school field trips in the early Fall.


20060715 17:03:46 nbsp I love this place, its a great activity for a summer morning, and the cheapest place to get raspberries.  If I am going to make fruit salad for a BBQ I try to make a trip out there that day, it doesnt take too long, and its worth it! Users/ShaunaMcKellar

20061106 04:53:06 nbsp What exactly about these acres is impossible? Who is Grandpa? Inquiring minds want to know... Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090521 23:50:52 nbsp Someone needs to tell them to update their web site Users/ScottRitchie
  Impossible!
Just call to ask what their hours are. In May when I called, they were open WednesdaysSundays

20090710 13:06:04 nbsp Went at end of May for berries! It was a super hot weekend, making us more hesitant to venture further out back on the farm.
The strawberries were perfectly ripe and super sweet! They werent like the supermaket strawberries that are gigantic but not too sweet. They had some already picked in baskets for sale.
Cherries sweet but seemed not completely ripe yet? Maybe beginning of June is a better time for cherry picking.
Peaches not ripe yet.
Apricots delicious! Very sweet
Marion Berriescareful when picking off the bushes; they have thorns. However, it was the perfect time for these berries, ripe, juicy and sweet! Delicious
The prices are extremely reasonable also. My total was $3.75 for a full basket (those smaller green ones) of marion berries, a full basket of strawberries, a couple apricots, and a fistful of cherries.
Will be returning next year!! Users/ViVi

20091017 08:48:15 nbsp They are open right now for October, during the weekend from 9 to 6 and during the week they have school groups coming through so theyre open to the public (the petting zoo is) at 11 AM until 6. Tractor rides only on the weekend. Both the tractor rides and maze is free! Users/wewais

20100510 11:23:45 nbsp Does anyone know if they have opened for the season?  I have checked their website, but it appears hopelessly out of date.  The calendar on the page suggests taht they dont open until June 1, but  I know I have picked there before that in the past.  Last year it seemed that they opened late and closed early and were mostly picking for local restaurants (just a perception).   Users/mlgoodson
  They were not open as of Saturday. I drive by there a few times a week and I always check because I love the place. Im waiting too!  Users/JenniferCook
  Thanks for the update. I emailed them and havent heard back yet either.  Will comment again if I hear anything.  Users/mlgoodson
  Just noticed that they updated their webpage (5/22) saying they will open Memorial Day weekend (5/295/31 from 96 each day.  They say they have strawberries, cherries and apricots.  Grandpas Barn is not open.  Users/mlgoodson

20100807 20:51:52 nbsp When I went by today, the gentleman at the pay station told me they will be open for two more weeks this year before they close until pumpkin season. Users/MeganCleary

20110529 04:40:01 nbsp Never heard of this place before.. Lived in Davis for 11 years.. Thanks to the Wiki I now have a new adventure to take.  Looking forward to it... Users/WesP

20120617 15:46:29 nbsp Quick note that I just picked some peaches out there, so they are open for the year (their website still says they are closed for the season).  They also had apricots and some early berries. Users/mlgoodson
