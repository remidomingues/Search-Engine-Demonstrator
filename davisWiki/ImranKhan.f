 About me 
I am a Fourth year at UCD originally from Mountain View, California. I went to Los Altos Highschool in, you guessed it, Los Altos.  My major is Biological Systems Engineering and I end up spending a lot of time in Bainer Hall. I enjoy playing guitar and piano. I also enjoy acting in any way, shape, or form. I play all sorts of videogames. You may see me in the MU Games Area MU games area playing pump it up: exceed 2 every once and a while. Im also down to play a game of Street Fighter 3: Third Strike with anyone good enough to challenge me.
