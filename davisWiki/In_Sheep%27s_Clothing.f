In Sheeps Clothing closed in June 2007.

In Sheeps Clothing is a yarn store.  They sit above Sogas and have a whole range of highquality yarn.  They have a bunch of Knitting knitting/sewing accessories (such as books, patterns, and tools).  They also offer classes so you can hone your knitting skills and become one with the yarn.

Every Friday is Knit Night from 6pm to 9pm.  Come hang out with fellow knitters and crocheters for tips, help and camaraderie.  The store is still open for business during Knit Night.

Its been 10 years, now its time to move on. Starting June 1st, we will begin our store closing sale. 


Ive got 2 scarfs made from yarn purchased here, and I like the way they both feel.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
