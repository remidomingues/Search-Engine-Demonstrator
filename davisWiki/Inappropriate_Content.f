For discussion of  Inappropriate Content by the Wiki Community.

Two general categories:
 1. Content that is inappropriate (any content that is illegal, nonfamily safe content, content not relevant to Davis)
 1. Uses of the Wiki that are inappropriate (Spam, SEO Spam, a forum for debate of unresolvable issues)

See also existing discussion on Wiki Ethics about what should be taboo on the wiki, will copy that over here as well.

 Should anything be taboo? If so, what? 

Possible ideas (add what you want, even if its just a bud of an idea):
   Threats of any kind. Threatening other users is totally inappropriate.
   Libel (spreading lies via print)
   Creating pages that intentionally mislead users.  This is not to say that dramatic or humorous wording is disallowed; just that it should be clear to an average reader when something is true versus when something is a joke or tongue in cheek.
   Anything that might legally be construed as Hate. Legally considered hate? There are only two places where the law considers hate speech to be problematic. The first is when it causes imminent danger. The second is in an employment context.
   Confrontational speech is usually edited or removed.  Controversial statements should be attributed to those who say them.
   Derisive commentary motivated by gender, race, orientation or political beliefs (Ive removed a number of really derisive comments about the campus conservatives lately  really I find it as offensive as any of the more commonly recognized forms of discrimination  theres no place for it here Users/KrisFricke)
   Personal information regarding an individual without their permission.  Some leeway might be acceptable for public figures.  When in doubt, get permission.
   Pornography
     Does this include links to pornography websites? (they are easy to find)  Please have someone explain specifics. Users/GabeKoulikov
       Depends on the context.  For instance, there was a porn shoot done on a local bridge.  A link to the gallery (with an appropriate warning) would make sense.  A link on somebodys personal page may well make sense (if the person is a photographer, model, etc).  A link in the middle of the entry on freetrade coffee probably wouldnt make sense.  There are exceptions to taboos (which is why they are taboos, not hard rules), but only ones where it makes sense and adds to the wiki.  Do you have any examples?  Users/JabberWokky jw

20090729 12:02:09 nbsp A long time ago, the occasional vulgarity level was an issue.  This was when the DavisWiki was possibly going to be used in local schools, and people wanted to censor out most usage of the Fword to that effect, to make it more friendly and if not PG, than PG13.  Users/EdWins
