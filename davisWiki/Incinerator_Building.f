At one point UC Davis operated an incinerator in addition to a landfill; around 1994 it was taken out of operation and dismantled.

While it was operational it was used by:
  The Secret Service  to dispose of counterfeit currency
  Yolo County Narcotics Enforcement Team (YONET)  to dispose of marijuana
  Engineering students  to burn rice hulls for the concrete canoe
  campus  to dispose of animal remains and at one point confidential paper

After the incinerator was removed this building housed the R4 Cardboard Baler.

Doesnt the California National Primate Research Center Primate Research Center have an incinerator for all the dead animals?

 Oh, no... not the counterfeit currency and marijuana... thats like the staple of a college students existence. HeeHee. Just kidding.
  I used to work there  never knew it was used as such...Thanks Wiki! Users/MikeSiminitus
