When editing on Davis Wiki you can insert an include macro ({{{Include(PageToInclude)}}}).

Here are the known include files.  Not all are serious, some just reflect the odd humor of the moment during some peoples wiki editing:

There are includes for #requestcontent requesting content, #commentmacro adding additional information to the comment macro, #commenttag tagging comments, #questionablecontent marking questionable content, #perspective marking balance issues, #historical marking historical content, #humor funny stuff, and #awards awards.
