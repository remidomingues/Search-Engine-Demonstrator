Every 4th of July is when Independence Day is celebrated.  It is the founding date of the wiki:wikipedia:United States of America (or at least when the founding was wiki:wikipedia:United States Declaration of Independence announced (Or at least when it was wiki:wikipedia:Independence_Day_(United_States)#Background approved by congress.)) and thus Davis holds a fair number of Holidays festivities on that day:

  The Davis Criterium Classic (bike races)
  4th of July/Kids Parade A parade for kids
  July 4th Fireworks
