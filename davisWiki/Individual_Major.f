An Individual Major is an opportunity for students to determine their own majors, given the courses available at UCD.  If you have some concept that cant be served by an ordinary major program, this is for you.  Also, its a good way of getting the most out of your student fees. Both the College of Letters and Science and College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences offer individual major programs.
