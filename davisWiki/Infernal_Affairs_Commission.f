 Note: Infernal Affairs Commission is simply a reference to the Internal Affairs Commission IAC, when said Commission members vote in a manner that others find galling.  The name is obviously a humorous play on Internal Affairs Commission.

People applying to Internal Affairs Commission IAC: be advised that members of the student body may take issue with your voting decisions.

Dear Internal Affairs Commissioners,

I was shocked to learn that you voted down the Pledge of Allegiance bill.  I
read the bill, it is wellwritten and perfectly fair.  I cannot understand
how all of you, in your right minds, could vote against a bill to say the
Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag.

Your no vote just doesnt make any sense.  Especially when considering
that UC Davis, as a public research university, relies on funding from the
STATE and FEDERAL levels of government.
Your decision rings with ingratitude for the deluge of money that the
state and federal governments rain down on this school.

Every time the ASUCD Senate has their meeting, many different opinions
bounce around the room.  Isnt it wonderful that the U.S. Constitution
allows for that freedom of speech, without any fear of retribution from the
government?  Voting no on this bill is a disservice to the principles that
even allow ASUCD to exist.

Any and every reputable political body in the entire nation says the Pledge
of Allegiance before their meetings begin.  You are all incredibly immature
for voting down this bill, especially since reciting the Pledge, or even
standing up to recognize the flag, would be optional.

And for those of you who are worried about selfpreservation...
Congratulations on having this in your permanent political record.  I hope
you realize that your chance for ever getting elected to any public office
is ruined, for the rest of your lives.

No discerning citizen would vote for a man/woman to represent them, if that
man/woman is on RECORD saying that the Pledge of Allegiance is not good
enough to be said, aloud, in a public university.  Especially since the
recitation of the Pledge, in this and in every situation, is optional.

Im not trying to be meanspirited about this particular point, but lets
face it.  If you ever run for any public office, your chances of victory are
very slim if the media somehow discovers your no vote.

You have also slimmed your chances of getting hired by any
nongovernmental organization or business that would take issue with your
vote.  All companies do background checks, as Im sure you are well aware.

So I wish you the best of luck in your future ventures, because with this
embarassing affair on record, youll need it.

Shame on you, those who voted no.  Youre not even elected officials.  Let
the Senators, elected by popular vote, do the legislating in ASUCD,
especially when it comes to bills of such incredible importance as this one.

When it comes down to principles, we as people dont bleed blue and gold, or
red and yellow.  Like it or not, we are granted many freedoms by the U.S.
Constitution, and saying the Pledge before a public meeting is simply a way
of recognizing those freedoms.  Thats all.

Sincerely,
Cameron Menezes  UC Davis class of 2005
