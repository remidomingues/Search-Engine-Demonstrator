Information and Educational Technology, more commonly known as IET, is a vastly bureaucratic division of UC Davis that deals with all of the campus technology needs. The mission of Information and Educational Technology (IET) is to create and support an information technology environment that enhances the ability of the UC Davis community to teach, do research, and provide public service.




 Divisions: 

  Office of the Vice Provost, Information and Educational Technology Office of the Vice Provost (VPIET)  Takes care of money, HR, and other random bureaucratic stuff so the other divisions dont have to. Theyre mostly based out of the PSL Building, but they also have personnel stationed with the divisions theyre serving.
  Academic Technology Services  Does everything from producing multimedia for various campus clients (Mediaworks) to podcasting and supporting the A/V equipment in the lecture halls (Classroom Technology Services). Based out of Surge II.
  Application Development  they bring you such gems as MyUCDavis, DaFis, Banner, PPS and Data Warehouse. If you know what more than three of those are, you know too much.
  Communications Resources  these people run most of the telecommunication infrastructure on campus. This includes Resnet, Moobilenet, cable television, computer networking, and the telephones.
  Data Center & Client Services  Runs the Campus Data Center as well as IT Express, the computing help desk for students, faculty and staff at UC Davis.

I love IET. Probably the best place to work on campus.   Michael Giardina

It seems there is a lack of commitment within UC Davis (I assume this group, in particular) to providing free network services to the student body and the public in general.  We have no ability to have personal sites (say, {{{students.ucdavis.edu/~philipneustrom}}}) and UC Davis does no mirroring or hosting of free software.  I think we should open up httpd on isun.ucdavis.edu!  Its also telling that __the man__ shut down the UC Davis IRC Server which was probably using about 10MB of bandwidth a month.
