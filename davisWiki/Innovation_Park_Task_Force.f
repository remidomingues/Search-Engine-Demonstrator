The Innovation Park Task Force is a group directed by the City Council to present findings and recommendations to the council with regard to establishing a business park to help the local economy and encourage innovation within Davis.  Due to the subject, the task force has delved deeply into the allocation and zoning of significant amounts of land in and around Davis.

The work of this Task Force recently http://www.davisvanguard.com/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id7376:councilpullsbackfrommacecurvelandswapinthefaceofoverwhelmingpubliccriticismaboutprocess&catid53:landuseopenspace&Itemid86 came under some scrutiny when on June 11, 2013, City Staff proposed that Davis turn down a grant for an agricultural easement, which the Open Space and Habitat Commission had worked on. More than this Task Force, questions are being raised about the Citys Chief Innovation Officer position, and the benefit corporation that partiallyfunded it, http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Davis/capitolcorridorventuresinc/134688812.aspx Capital Corridor Ventures.

As a point of trivia, it is often referred to in the plural form Innovation Parks Task Force in council meetings.

More recently, the city of Davis released a http://www.davisvanguard.org/councilclearswayforinnovationcenterrfeitomoveforward/ Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEI) which resulted in three possible innovation park concepts.  The innovation park proposals include http://www.davisvanguard.org/cityreceivesthreeproposalsinrfeiprocesspart1mace200/ a development along Mace Boulevard, http://www.davisvanguard.org/cityreceivesthreeproposalsinrfeiprocesspart2northwestquadrant/ a development in the northwest quadrant near Sutter Hospital, and http://www.davisvanguard.org/cityreceivesthreeproposalsinrfeiprocesspart3davisranch/ a development along I80.
