Insects are sixlegged arthropods which are almost always winged at some stage of their life.  The diversity of insects is vast, and many different species of insects can be found in Davis.

The Entomology department studies insects and runs the Bohart Museum of Entomology on Campus which is a good place to go to learn more about insects.  If, on the other other other other hand, you want to get rid of your insects, try one of the local pest control resources.

Spiders, having eight legs, are not insects, but arachnids.  Pillbugs, meanwhile, are crustaceans (but not pink crustaceans).  Nor are other Davis Bicycle Users Group BUGs or Spider Friends.

20100324 22:58:51 nbsp Today I was waiting at a bus stop and I found a pile of these weird insects on top of something. Some of them had a red rear end and the rest was black. They looked like slightly large ants and at first I thought they looked like worms or something until I realized that another one of the bugs were attached to the rear end of the other bug. Anyone have a clue what these could have been? Users/hankim

20100324 23:12:08 nbsp I have always wondered what those are and why they are stuck to each other, they seem to be very numerous this time of year. Users/DagonJones

20100325 09:32:29 nbsp That is them, Red shouldered bugs or Boxelder bugs. Users/DagonJones

20100325 10:06:51 nbsp Koelreuteria paniculata is a host, as are maples. They arent particularly harmful, but the populations can get locally so large that they are a nuisance. They do seem to be in a permanent state of copulation. Users/DonShor
  As are we all...
