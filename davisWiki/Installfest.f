Whats an Installfest?
The LUGOD Linux Users Group of Davis helps people install, configure, and fix Linux installations at this usually(bi)monthly event, held on Saturdays or Sundays, historically at UC Davis. Its a free workshop to encourage community self help around open source software and the Linux operating system. Spectators are welcome and we are more than happy to discuss any relevant topics while we work.

Next Installfest scheduled for January 26th, 2013 ( PES PES 2005)
For the details and to RSVP to bring your computer in go to http://www.lugod.org/if


Whats the big deal?
  Free Software
   Including the freedom to modify it as you please ... (as if we are all hard core programmers)
  Community Support
  True customization:
   Do you use a browser other than Internet Explorer?
   Do you use any other open source Applications: Inkscape, GIMP, OpenOffice, Thunderbird, Filezilla?
   Answered yes to any of the above, why not try an open source operating system too?
  You can keep your current system working and share files between them with Dual Booting or Virtual Machines
  We teach you how to make all the changes yourself.

What can I run linux on?
We can help you with:
  Laptops
  Tablets
  Desktops
  Servers
  Media Center PC
  Wifi Routers (e.g. Tomato or DDWrt firmware)

History
(Reverse Order)

 Sept 10
  Gnomeppp run via gksu to get cell modems working (might be supported in 10.04)

 June 10
  Virtual Machines are the hot thing these days, 25% of our installs.
  The proper broadcom in ubuntu is the STA option in restricted drivers
  USB sticks with GRUB and a selection of ISO files work well for most installs.
  If a netbook(with older SSD) wont take GRUB install, zero out the drive and try a fresh install.

 May 10
  Windows Vista and potentially Windows 7 are troublesome to configure dual boots because they tend to place system files really far back on the drive which makes it hard to create a large enough partition for Linux. There are methods to move the files but they take a lot of time and are not 100% (Often requiring a windows disk to repair), Virtual Machines and WUBI installs are recommended if the user doesnt want to do a clean install.

 May 09
  Topic: How to choose a distro without starting a fight.
  Included one netbook install using the new http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadnetbook Ubuntu Netbook Remix from a usb flash drive, and one http://wubiinstaller.org/ WUBI
  New room worked well, wired access was very useful.
  3 Installs, about 36 spectators/helpers were there at various times

 Sept 08
  Topic Discussed  Partitioning, Dual Boots vs. Virtual Machines
  We did 2 Vista/Ubuntu dual boots, using Vista to shrink the partitions to create space for the Ubuntu installer. Grub worked fine.

 May 08
 Wireless is now improved in the Zinfandel Lounge in the South Silo thanks to the GSA for putting in a new moobilenet access point.
  2 fresh installs, one on cir. 1998 laptop  note we used the 6.06 LTS(needed older cd drivers) which installed no X initially then added XFCE, Xorg, GDM, abiword, gnumeric, firefox and gedit oh and hal which seemed to make the ethernet card work again; for a fast and simple machine. Other fresh install was on dual boot Vista, seemed to work ok using Vista to change the partitions(was done before arriving).
  For those who didnt come you missed a chance to tinker with an http://www.laptop.org/ OLPC while we waited for packages to download.

  Lessons
  If youre having issues running OpenGL apps, try turning off Beryl.
  If X breaks on a distupgrade, finish the upgrade via command line then run a dpkgreconfigure xserverxorg.
  New fedora releases have a lag before community packages get built. ie. ndisgtk isnt available yet
  Keep some good older distros around for older machines.

 April 08
 We tested out the new location of the Zinfandel Lounge in the South Silo. Wireless proved to be a bit spotty as thought, although a moobilenet router may be installed close by soon.

 March 08
 While we only did 2 installs, 1 was a custom live cd of Xubuntu which we installed on a bootable usb flash drive. Also the crowd of spectators/discussion participants was quite large, 78 of us.

 Past
Back in the day, and apparently still on a server the Computer Science Club CS Club and LUGOD had a great idea to help people learn about Free and Open Source software.

Gotchas
Things we figure out and sometimes forget.
  In a standard U(Ku)(Xu)buntu install network manager sometimes causes problems, notably you cant save the location profiles, the nmapplet doesnt indicate signal strength.
   Reinstall from the Ubuntu alternate disc (even on a Xubuntu system) or try wicd which has to be downloaded from sourceforge. If that doesnt work try wlassistant with either wicd or networkmanager installed.
 ndisgtk a new gui for config of ndiswrapper, real easy.
  For some older machines if installing a U(K)(X)buntu flavor you may need to go with and older version or the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD minimal CD, note option 2 here only works if you have a wired connection.

If you have been to an installfest, please write about your experience

20071230 15:07:14 nbsp Rusty Minden helped me install Debian Woody on my 486, thanks very much! Users/NickSchmalenberger

  Sure, RSVP for the next one and well give it a shot. Ive done a http://familiar.handhelds.org/ Familiar install on an Ipaq PDA and imagine its similar in some respects. Users/AlexMandel
