Located on the Davis Senior High School Campus,  the Instructional Performing Arts Building (IPAB) supports the performing arts across the Davis Joint Unified School District.  Completed in 2005, the building features the 500 seat Brunelle Performance Hall,  several music classrooms, and backstage support areas.
The Brunelle Performance Hall is a well equipped proscenium theater with a full fly system, state of the art lighting system, and a motorized spiral pit lift.  The theater also houses a full acoustical shell which can be used for instrumental and vocal performances.

The Brunelle Performance Hall is available for rentals to the Davis community and beyond. The facility is equipped to handle lectures, concerts, film screenings, theatrical performances, and most other types of public events.  Often times students are available to help staff events, as it provides the unique opportunity for district students to be exposed to performances beyond their school experience.

The theater can be booked hourly, daily, or weekly depending on need. Since the availability of the theater varies,  please contact the Performing Arts Facilities Coordinator for rates and availability.
