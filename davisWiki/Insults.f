In WikiWikiWeb other Wikis, like C2, insults are not appreciated.  Here, feel free  if that place down the street gave you food poisoning, put how you felt and exactly how long you wanted to kill the cook as you hunkered down over the toilet. (Make sure you understand the process of food poisoning before leveling any charges however.) Profanity is discouraged, but there are plenty of insults that can be made without them.


Theres a difference between insults that are merely insults and a heated response.  I dont like unnecessarily derisive and insulting language, because it is usually written in haste.  What might be considered an insult to someone may end up useful to someone else.  Being libel careful with your words is important.
