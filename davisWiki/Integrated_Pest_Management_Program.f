Based out of UC Davis, the Integrated Pest Management Program or IPM Program has developed and promoted ecologically sound pest control methods to all kinds of California settings, from urban dwellers to natural resource managers.  Their vision statement is, Making ecosystembased integrated pest management THE way Californians manage pests.  They are part of the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, employing over 30 people.


They define Integrated pest management, or IPM, as being an ecosystembased strategy that focuses on longterm prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties. Pesticides are used only after monitoring indicates they are needed according to established guidelines, and treatments are made with the goal of removing only the target organism. Pest control materials are selected and applied in a manner that minimizes risks to human health, beneficial and nontarget organisms, and the environment.
