The Integrated Studies Honors Program (ISHP) is an invitational program designed to help highachieving students integrate knowledge from various fields of study and learn in a small classroom environment. It emphasizes the first year of a students time at Davis as an opportunity to learn about the campus community and prepare for research in later years. Students take three fourunit classes and two oneunit seminars over the course of their first year. They all have less than twentyfive students, so it provides a different perspective from most freshman classes. ISHP is a part of the University Honors Program (UHP), along with the Davis Honors Challenge (DHC). Program offices are located in 1342 Surge III.

The Integrated Studies Honors Program is a part of the wiki:davis:University Honors Program.


Examples of ISHP courses: The Scientific Study of Consciousnes; Inequality; Science in the Renaissance; Storytelling (a popular choice!); Americans Debate Their Rights; Globalization; Biophotonics; Documentary Photography (1unit seminar).

For years IS was located in Tercero B Building, nearest neighbor of The Dairy the campus dairy.  It was quite the fragrant location on warm evenings.  Ever since the 20032004 school year, though, theyve enjoyed newer, nicer digs in Segundo North, in Miller Hall.  They left behind some great murals on the walls of B Building, though (though the letter buildings were demolished in March 2012).

Rumor has it that the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion grew out of IS people run amok, if it ever existed.  However, this story is likely the work of the Illuminati.

The integrated Studies Honors program proved to be the best thing I did freshman year. My year had an amazing group of people that bonded extremely well and had a blast. It was great for a first year to have so many friends and feel so welcome. The classes were interesting, especially Shakespeare, and offered experiences and subjects that youd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Also, priority registration has proved to be extremely useful to this day. Davis Honors Challenge may be more challenging (I do not know, I have not been in it), but Integrated Studies provided me many fond memories and friends, and I dont think Davis Honors Challenge would have done the same (different structure).Users/ChristyMarsden

20121001 13:33:49 nbsp IS was a great program.  I was in it in 0203, and my wife was in it 0304.  We both loved it.  For one thing, you really get to know the people in your dorm.  I was back in B building, when the program was a little smaller, so I got to know everyone in the program quite well.  My wife was in it the first year in Miller, when it was substantially larger; at that point, it sounds like people connected a bit more floorbyfloor.  Regardless, you have a much smaller group of people with whom you share classes and living space.  Its a great social experience and a great way to get connected.  I remain very close friends with many of my fellow ISers to this day, and its a broader group of friends than I think I would have developed in a different dorm situation.

You also wind up with excellent instructors.  The classes that wind up in the program, and the professors who teach them, are superb.  While the education may not directly contribute to your major (if youve chosen one), you will be a better person for it.  The classes I took were fascinating, generally very entertaining, and developed skills and interests that I might not have otherwise developed.

I took a debate course focused on American rights fall quarter, taught by Distinguished Teaching Award Jay Mechling.  While I didnt realize it at the time, that class was the foundation for my interest in the law.  Its probably what started me down the path to my career as an attorney.

A storytelling class taught by John Boe was incredibly entertaining and taught me a lot about public speaking and how to engage an audience, as well as teaching me a lot about my classmates.

Science of the Renaissance approached science from a historical and philosophical perspective, following the development of the scientific method and a number of different areas of study over the course of centuries.

If you have an opportunity to join IS, you should take it.  It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, and many of the friends I made in the IS dorm remain close to this day.  I made connections with some of the professors in a way thats hard to do with huge classes, and Professor Mechling was a reference for me for years.  Ive since been back to speak to one of his classes, and I hope I can remain involved in the future. Users/TomGarberson
