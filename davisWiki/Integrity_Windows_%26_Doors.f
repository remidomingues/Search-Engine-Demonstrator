20120127 14:38:17 nbsp We had Integrity install new windows and a door when we moved into the house. My first impression was great  nice people. Then we had them install a new front door and glass sliding door. Second impression  not so great. The front door was fine. The sliding glass door was a different story. Overall the installation of the sliding glass door went well until they put on the screen  which was visibly skewed. I asked if they would replace it  they said yes. A few weeks went by and I received no call regarding a new screen. I then called them to get an update on the screen. They apologized and then sent Kirk, the owner, out to take a look. He confirmed that the screen was skewed and said that he would replace it. A few more weeks went by and I called to ask about the status again. They told me that the manufacturer would call me in a day. The manufacturer never called, so I called Integrity a few days later. It was then that they told me that the sliding glass door manufacturer, International Window Company (IWC) had gone out of business and Integrity could not replace the screen. I initially accepted the explanation but the more I thought about it, the more it didnt make sense. Arent most sliding glass doors standard and therefore have standard screen sizes. Even if our sliding glass door was custom, there are other companies out there that manufacture sliding screen doors. I called Integrity back to ask them, no call back. A few weeks later we had remodeling work done on our house and the contractors told us that IWC was back in business again. I immediately called Integrity back about the screen door. No call back. A few weeks went by and I called them and left another message. No call back. I called about two weeks later, just in case they had missed my other calls  no call back. Is the thought of having a screen door that actually slides on the track smoothly too much ask? I finally called one last time to express my feelings of neglect and how disappointed I was. No call back still. I never plan on using Integrity Windows and Doors again. Im sure that they are probably nice people, but being nice people and running a business with integrity are two different things. Users/HilaryHarkins
