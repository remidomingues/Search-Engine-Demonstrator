The Interchange to Nowhere is located just West of Davis on Interstate 80 I80.  Consisting of onramps and offramps to Kidwell Road and a freeway overcrossing, the interchange to nowhere appears to serve no practical purpose, hence its name.  Kidwell Road connects Olmo Lane (a very short frontage road on the north side of I80) to Sparling Lane (a slightly longer frontage road on the south side of I80).  CHP officers like to sit on the ramps of the interchange to nowhere to watch for speeders on I80.

Part of a bitter debate that lasted the better part of two decades, the interchange to nowhere finally got the goahead to be completed in May of 1989.  Originally promised to local farmers to provide continued access to farmland on both sides of the freeway once the newly approved I80 replaced highway 40, the interchange to nowhere was blocked in court by the city of Davis over growth concerns.

The interchange to nowhere is the proposed site of Bridgeway Farms, a large fruitstand complex reminiscent of the original The Nut Tree Nut Tree.
