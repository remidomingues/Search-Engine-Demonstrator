 Mission Statement 
The Interfaith Campus Council (ICC) is an association of campus religious organizations, represented by their professional staff and/or student leaders who are committed to working together collegially and cooperatively.  Although we come from different religious and denominational traditions, all of our organizations consider interfaith engagement to be an essential part of our own programs as well as a vital shared service that we offer to UC Davis and especially its students. We seek to promote mutual respect, understanding, and appreciation among people of different faiths, and we work together to create shared programs and activities that give witness to our common values and ideals.

If your campus religious organization would like to become a member of the Interfaith Campus Council, or if you represent a campus unit or student organization that would like to work with the ICC, please email our Convener mailto:campusministry@uudavis.org Aidan McCormack for our next meeting date.

 Our BIG Project! 
The Multifaith Living Community at UC Davis
The Multifaith Living Community is an innovative project, sponsored by CA House and supported by the Interfaith Campus Council at UC Davis, to gather 34 students per year of different faiths to live in a community together.

Through their own faith journeys, shared meals and programs, and community service and justice work, these students will provide a model of peace, understanding and cooperation among people of different faiths and cultures.

To house this new community, CA House is building six new townhouses on their property at 433 Russell Boulevard, directly across from the UC Davis campus, and organizing student and community supporters around this project.
