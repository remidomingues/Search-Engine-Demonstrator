Interland is a Davisbased property management firm which manages over 5,000 apartment units and more than 2 million square feet of office space.  Founded by Jim Joseph in 1971, Interland hit it big developing land in what became Silicon Valley.  Other high profile developments apparently included the wellknown Levi Strauss Plaza in San Francisco.  They now focus mostly on managing luxury apartments and highdollar commercial spaces.

Though they operate out of a nice new building in South Davis, I dont think they bother with managing any Davis apartments.  They seem to own Tanglewood, but the daytoday management is handled by FPI Management another firm. They do own and manage the Research Park Drive UC Davis Research Park facility, and are also the developer of the new retail center currently under construction behind their office building at 1480 Drew Avenue.
