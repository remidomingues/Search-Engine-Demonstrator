The International Agricultural Development (also known as IAD) is a graduate groups graduate group putting together soil scientists, agriculturalists, community development, engineering, economics and anything vaguely related to international development and College of Agriculture agriculture in developing countries. IAD students are generally getting a masters degree although sometimes they get a masters in IAD and a PhD elsewhere.

You can get a bachelors degree in IAD. The program is very small, with only ten or twenty undergrads in a given year in the department. Heres the link for the undergraduate http://admissions.ucdavis.edu/academics/major_view.cfm?majoraiad website.

And were definitely not all hippies, weve got lots of science people and sociology peeps too. Check out the facebook group! Users/AnBan
