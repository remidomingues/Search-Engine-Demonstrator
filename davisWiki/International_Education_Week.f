International Education Week is a US Departments of State and Education sponsored event taking place November 716. It is an opportunity to raise awareness and celebrate the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide. By connecting students, faculty, staff and international visitors we can provide ways to understand how we impact the global community.

During IEW, the campus will showcase knowledge and events that transcend beyond the classroom to empower students to become informed and active citizens who can offer solutions to the pressing issues facing our global society. Education is part of our efforts to promote programs that prepare Americans for a global environment and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn, and exchange experiences in the United States.
