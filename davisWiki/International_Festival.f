20111001 17:09:34 nbsp The 5 year old and I went to this today. Vets Hall was really too crowded, dangerously so. The performances were terrific. I dont know why they couldnt have performed in the theater though. It would be more comfortable, all the patrons would be able to see, and it would free up room in the hall. Users/NoelBruening

20130814 13:26:14 nbsp Thank you for your feedback Noel. The festival is a multifaceted event with 8 venues to participate in, including the main stage. We will be exploring moving to another site in the future to accommodate the enthusiasm and growing attendance. Last year, we tried having entertainment in the theater and no one attended due to the fact that the weather was beautiful and there were other venues going on outside. Hence our performers in the theatre were very disappointed even though they loved the building. We hope you attend again this year, but we appreciate your feedback. Sincerely, International House.
