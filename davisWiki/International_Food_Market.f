International Food Market might be one of the few Ethnic Markets international food stores in Davis, but it is a good store. It carries primarily Indian and Middle Eastern foods and products, along with some Mexican, Brazilian, and Asian foods. Before you shell out for higherpriced spices, Tea tea, Yerba mate yerba mate, rice or legumes at the Davis Food Coop, stop by the International Food Market and possibly save yourself a couple of bucks. In addition to spices, lentils, tahini, dried fruit pastes, nuts and such, this market also carries prepared spice mixes, Middle Eastern newspapers, Hindi music & videos, a huge selection of international prepaid phone cards, prayer rugs, henna, hookahs, and other items. Homemade sweets and other finger foods are often available near the register. A small refrigerated case holds fresh vegetables, Bulgarian and feta cheeses and other items requiring refrigeration, and an even smaller freezer stores frozen goods. Even Western European transplants will find useful items such as Ribena syrup and rose water. This is probably the closest thing Davis will ever have to a Berkeleystyle Indian food store!

The store also carries Haldirams amazing line of heatandserve meals. As far as instant/microwaveable foods go, these are the most authentic and tasty Indian dishes you can find in Davis. Priced at $2.25 for a package that serves up to two people, they are also an incredible bargain.

The market once sold wonderful fresh samosas, but they keep changing providers, and the quality has since gone way down hill.

20050314 21:00:52 nbsp Great shisha and awesome samosas on sale here, and the people who work here are really friendly Users/PhilBerghuis

20050528 14:12:05 nbsp They currently have a bunch of really good deals on rice, including a free (good quality) rice cooker if you buy five bags of a certain brand, and buy one bag, get two free of another brand. In both cases, the price per pound is comparable to other bulk rice available in Davis. If you eat rice frequently, or can share with friends, it never hurts to stock up Users/JessicaLuedtke

20050917 14:28:40 nbsp yay for a place in davis that has bollywood...now where are those tollywood movies eh? Users/ErnBro

20060729 17:00:17 nbsp Just visited today hoping to see some international foods. Hmm... Saw only bunch of the same stuff you can find in Safeway/Albertson/Nugget but apparently spoiled on the shelves. Just my IMHO. Users/SergeLutsenko

20061115 17:34:16 nbsp Great for picking up dried and canned foods which at the supermarket would carry an additional exotic charge.  Saves me a trip into Sac or Berkeley for a lot of items.  Limited selection, but a godsend in a place like Davis. Users/VivekMathrani

20070125 08:17:32 nbsp Lots of spices here for cheap where normally you might pay five times the price at a supermarket. A wonderful find for certain ingrdients like cardamom and poppy seeds! Users/ProtoGarrett

20070428 22:17:44 nbsp I really like this place.  Ive purchased produce, bread, cheap and oddly named treats, and rented movies.  It took me quite some time to get to know this place now I probably go by an average of twice per month, sometimes more.  Be patient, youll probably find something you like.  My current favorite:  the Tea Tips tea. Users/JeffShaw

20070715 14:49:35 nbsp I bought a couple sealed bags of rice here that ended up having weevils in them (or something else that was small and crawly).  Outside of that, I like the store, theres lots of interesting stuff in here to try.  I just stay away from the bags of rice now. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070724 07:22:23 nbsp the bugs in the rice is common  put some bay leaves in there Users/RohiniJasavala

20070801 19:59:06 nbsp You tell em Ro, represent!

On the subject of Hindi films (or, as theyre popularly called, Bollywood), the owner said that they dont rent enough to warrant a more expanded selection.

Incidentally, as it turns out, her sister is my neighbor back in the Bay. Users/JesseSingh

20070918 23:35:37 nbsp This is a GREAT place to find Asian food.  The prices are not really high by California standards.  You guys should go over there, the owner is really friendly........ Users/SoMeOnE

20071109 01:54:55 nbsp They have Guaran√°!!!  And at a very affordable price too!  I bought a 12 pack {{{^_^}}}  They also have the soft cream cheese spread (kinda like happy cow) and unsweetened shredded coconut (its sweetened everywhere else, which doesnt work with my macaroon recipes).  Though, they were waiting for a shipment of dried figs. Users/Chibi

20080309 17:09:59 nbsp The samosas are great, and cheap!  Get the free sauce when you buy one. Users/WilliamBeamish

20080830 12:20:35 nbsp This is the only place Ive found that sells Lebni and middle eastern style yogurt in Davis. They also have really good quality spices for really cheap. I love shopping here.  Users/ascapoccia

20090114 12:08:52 nbsp They sell shredded coconut without sugar added!  (Adding sugar to coconut is a bizarrely American thing to do). Users/GeorgeWells

20090220 13:55:16 nbsp You can make really delicious muhammara using the pomegranate molasses and the fire roasted sweet peppers that they sell here. Try the recipe: http://www.globalgourmet.com/destinations/turkey/muhammara.html  Users/MargaretaLelea

20090525 16:44:50 nbsp Hi,

Fellow BBQers...they have some awesome stuff for the bbqing !! Check out the Shan masala spice mix for marinating. They also have some skewers out as well...late. Users/sol

20100402 08:24:05 nbsp I went in here once cause I love Indian food and was hoping to find some ingredients, however upon browsing I found a lot of expired products and their naan/bread products in the back were growing mold. I pointed it out to the store clerk, the expire can goods I means, and he said it was still good.  Needless to say I didnt buy anything from there.  Instead I went to World Market and picked up the same item for a cheaper price and it was not expire.   Users/kikao

20100409 17:47:29 nbsp this place is awesome! has really great samosas if they are fresh .. halal meat is a saving grace too ...  Users/hiraalikhan

20100622 17:02:12 nbsp This place has all your Indian/Pakistani grocery needs. They also started carrying fresh curry leaves !! Good luck finding them in stock though as they sell out faster than these guys can keep them in stock. Aside from curry leaves, they also now have a section for fresh vegs and fruits ( all locally grown ).  Users/sol

20100818 19:18:40 nbsp I couldnt get by without this shop in town. Huge spice collection, great prices on nuts and olive oil, and tons of things you cant get anywhere else. The baklava is some of the best in town, too! If you havent been here yet, check it out. Users/JohnDudek

20100922 19:37:22 nbsp The main reason I love this place is because there seems to always be something new to try. Actually, being a typical white/underexposed American, most of the stuff in the store was new. Now Ive tried quite a bit of it, but they update their stock often enough that its always an adventure.
Prices are good too! Users/nerowski

20101107 16:54:32 nbsp They have a variety of Yerba Mate: Cruz de Malta and a Leo one and there was one other. The prices are all sub $5 for 1 lb or less of yerba mate. This is far cheaper than anything at the COOP. Users/AnonymousOnline

20110206 17:22:57 nbsp AMAYZING Workers, AMAYZING place D Users/SanaBenHarchache

20110326 18:42:26 nbsp They sell the best baklava Ive ever had! Very good samosas also. The prices are good and the service is friendly. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110331 19:22:25 nbsp Wow, I just discovered this place today. I thought I had to go into sac for some of the stuff I needed, but it turned out that this place had it! I got lavash, sumac, and will be back for the good deals on tea and for feta :) Users/Babhari

20110619 12:08:24 nbsp The place kinda stinks!
I got some Semolina that I ended up dumping the whole dessert (Basboosa) because of it. The staff are not friendly. and the place is way expensive. Id rather go to Sac to get what I need. Users/AllenHasson

20110619 23:33:01 nbsp Sriracha for 2.99 everyday! the big bottle Users/StevenDaubert

20120311 16:17:44 nbsp Particularly extensive selection of Indian spices; if you need half a pound of tumeric, this is the place.  Users/PhoebeAyers

20120630 18:47:26 nbsp I love this place !! Every time I go here, I discover something new. They have a Portuguese drink called Guarana that you HAVE to try. My Brazilian friend found a bunch of other stuff that she hadnt had since moving to the states.   Users/sol

20120731 18:20:35 nbsp Great shop with a lot of variety. Especially people from the subcontinent can find a wealth of ingredients necessary for their curries. Ill definitely be coming back.
