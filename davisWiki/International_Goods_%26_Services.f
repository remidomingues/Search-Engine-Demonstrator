Internationals and people of nonEuropean ethnicity arriving in Davis may find themselves a bit desperate to identify places to purchase familiar foods and items. Considering Davis demographics, these same individuals may be interested in networking information and organizations that can provide assistance with visa requirements and Housing Guide housing. Of necessity, much of this information will include Sacramento resources unless our local economy grows to the point of providing a wellrounded selection.
