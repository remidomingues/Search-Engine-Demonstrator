The International Relations Student Association (IRSA) was reestablished in Fall 2004.  It currently has a core group of approximately 1015 members who direct the club and design the activities, with an email list membership of over 200.  They accept new members at any time during the year.  Many of their members attend only those events that are of particular interest to them.  They are open not only to international relations majors, but also to any students that are interested in international affairs.  One of their key members in 20042005 was a physics major!

During the academic quarter, IRSA typically has two gatherings per week.  They will usually have one general meeting, during which they cover club business as well as hold a discussion of current issues in world affairs.  In addition, they have weekly special events.  This event can be a trivia night, such as Winter 2005s IR Team Jeopardy, which was won by the outstanding Track 2 team.  Theyve also had distinguished speakers, including Ambassador James Ledesma, who served most recently as a DiplomatinResidence at Morehouse College, and prior to that was Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Princip√©.

When IRSA is not having major events, IRSA members will often gather for Coffee and Newspapers, during which they meet at a local cafe such as Cafe Roma or Crepeville and discuss international events and issues.

IRSA helps bring students together who hold similar interests.  In the 20042005 academic year, the International Affairs Journal (IAJ) was born out of IRSA.  In addition, some students discovered through IRSA an undergraduate research conference at the European Union Center of California at Scripps College and presented their research to a large group of students, professors, and other academics.
