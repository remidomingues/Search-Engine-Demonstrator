 Megacorporations 

  Pac Bell, no I mean SBC, no I mean AT&T (http://www.dslreports.com/reviews/2170 reviews) provides bargainbasement DSL internet service in cooperation with Yahoo http://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/ and the NSA. However, they are locally the physical provider of dsl (the wires), so for many problems they may have a better ability to troubleshoot. On the other hand they dont provide services such as a shell server. (They will start to put a cap of 250GB per year, $10 per GB you go over)
