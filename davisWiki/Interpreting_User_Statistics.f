Devoted wiki gnomes are well familiar with the {{{Stats(Username)}}} macro that reports on a users past contribution to the wiki.  It lists (1) the number of pages edited, (2) pages created, and (3) the number of images contributed.  These stats are collectively displayed on the User Statistics page.  But how can one objectively compare the contributions of different users?  This is a question that has kept almost nobody awake at nightbut heres an answer anyway.

The difficulty of such a comparison lies in the fact that the three statistics reported are not of like units.  The first is in pages, the second in edits, and the third in images.  So the first step in comparison is to convert each to the same type of unit.  Of course every wiki gnomes preference is to convert them all to units of happiness or some other form of utility, but the metaphysics of such a conversion is beyond the abilities of this author.  Instead, well convert them to a more tangible form, words.

For Pages edited and Pages created, this is a straightforward procedure.  At the time of this page creation, the average words involved in the last 10 page edits and creationsFootNote(Redirects were ignored and only new new pages were counted.) was respectively 16.27 and 126.36.  So each page edit and created page will be worth this many words.  Converting images to words, however, involves a bit of handwaving so youll just have to trust me.  An image is worth a thousand words, so well set it at that.

So, here we have the standard conversion chart for comparison of user statistics:

Now, returning to the original statistics.  Take for example someone who has edited 4112 pages, created 256 pages, and contributed 326 images.  Their score in terms of words would be (4,112 edits  16.27 words) + (256 creations  126.37 words) + (326 images  1,000 words), which sums to 425,252.96 wordsa commendable total.  Any two users can thus be compared equally.

Using the stats available on the morning of May 9^th^, 2005 and a VERY subjective method of sorting users into classes the following table was created:


Primary role was assigned based on the relationship between a users three stats (edits, pages, photos).

Because number of reverts by a user is not currently given in the {{{Stats(Username)}}} wiki:wikispot:Help with Macros macro, the File(dwrevert.csh) script written by Users/CraigBrozinsky may be used to calculate the number of edits, reverts and ratio of reverts to edits of a user by analyzing their edit history pages.
