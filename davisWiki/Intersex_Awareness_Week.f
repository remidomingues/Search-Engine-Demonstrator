Intersex Awareness Week is held annually in late February as a time of education and awareness around intersex issues and experiences.  It is organized under the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. Events vary greatly, from speakers, to activist projects, Intersex 101 and academic discussions of community intersections (to name just a few).

Intersex conditions can include, but are not limited to:
5alpha reductase deficiency, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), Aphallia, Clitoromegally (large clitoris), Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), gonadal dysgenesis (partial & complete), hypospadias, Klinefelter Syndrome, micropenis, mosaicism involving “sex” chromosomes, MRKH (Mullerian agenesis; vaginal agenesis; congenital absence of vagina), ovotestes (formely called “true hermaphroditism”), Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS), penile raphe, Progestin Induced Virilization, Swyer Syndrome, Turner Syndrome.  These conditions are popularly known for the gender issues they present, but many are also associated with chronic health issues that require lifelong medical care ranging from hormone treatment, bone density issues to cardiac conditions.

The 2011 Intersex Awareness Week is from February 28 – March 4, 2011. The schedule is as follows:

WEDNESDAY 3/2

Keynote: Hida Viloria
7 PM MU II
Hida Viloria is the Human Rights Spokesperson for the Organisation Intersex International (OII), the largest intersex organization in the world. She has a degree in Gender and Sexuality from U.C. Berkeley, and has been on the vanguard of intersex activism since attending the first intersex conference in history in 1996, and appearing in the first intersex documentary, Hermaphrodites Speak. She has lectured and spoken extensively on the topic of intersex, including appearances on ABCs 20/20, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and the documentary films Gendernauts and One in 2000. Viloria is currently the only intersex person in the world who was not medically altered (either nonconsensually as a child or by choice), who openly advocates for an end to socalled medical correction of ambiguous intersex bodies like her own. Last October, in the wake of the Caster Semenya controversy, she served, by invitation, as the intersex representative at the International Olympic Committees meeting of experts in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she argued against the pathologization of the intersexed, and for the inclusion of intersex female athletes in competitive sport.

Kate Bornstein  Hello, Cruel World: An Outlaws MiniGuide to Survival
7 PM Roessler 66
Sometimes, whatever it is that gives you the most joy, pleasure or relief also gets you into the deepest trouble—especially when you try to explain it to other people. Like when you love someone youre not supposed to love. Or when the way you express yourself makes other people queasy. As harmless as you feel youre being, people may still think youre bad, wrong or immoral. There are far too many people who are in that position in life, and it goes far beyond simply sex and gender. This workshop is 90120 minutes of Kate talking with you about doing anything it takes to make your life more worth living. Anything. With the single rule: Don’t be mean.
KATE BORNSTEIN is an author, playwright and performance artist whose work to date has been in service to sex positivity, gender anarchy, and to building a coalition of those who live on cultural margins. Kates book, Hello, Cruel World: 101 Alternatives To Suicide For Teens, Freaks, and Other Outlaws, was published in 2007. Her groundbreaking books Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the Rest of Us and My Gender Workbook are taught in over 150 colleges around the world. A new anthology, Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation, coedited with S. Bear Bergman, recently hit bookstores. Her memoir, Kate Bornstein Is A Queer and Pleasant Danger is due out before the end of 2011.
