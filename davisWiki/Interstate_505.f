Interstate 505 connects Interstate 80 in north Vacaville with Interstate 5 in northern Yolo County. I505 goes mainly through rural areas, although it goes through the eastern edge of Winters. It is two lanes each way and is mainly used by truckers and other vehicles transporting goods. I505 was built before Highway 113 was a real highway and was meant to be a short cut through Yolo County into Solano County so trucks would not have to go all the way into Sacramento to reach I80.

From CR14 to I5 it is bike accessible.
