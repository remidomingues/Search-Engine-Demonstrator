The Interviewing Committee Update Act is an ASUCD Constitutional Amendment, to be voted on in the Winter 2009 ASUCD Election.  Its widely considered noncontroversial, as it removes the position of ASUCD Student Government Advisor from the Constitution.  That job is intentionally vacant due to lack of funding.  Additional cuts of nearly $40,000 will be needed this year in ASUCD, so it is unlikely that anyone is seriously considering bringing the $28,000 adviser position back at this time.

 Text of the measure 

Please vote for one of the following options:

 Yes, I approve of the Interviewing Committee Update Act
 No, I do not approve of the Interviewing Committee Update Act
