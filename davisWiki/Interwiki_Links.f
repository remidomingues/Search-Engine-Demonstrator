 Interwiki what? 

As you may or may not know, Davis wiki is not the only wiki on the Internet. The orginial wiki was created by wiki:Wiki:WardCunningham Ward Cunningham, at c2.com and is called the wiki:Wiki:WikiWikiWeb WikiWikiWeb also see WikiWikiWeb DavisWiki Entry. It is esentially a website about programing and patterns (yes, patterns), however, it has a great deal of discussion about wiki:C2:WikiEthics Wiki Ethics.

A much larger site, wiki:WikiPedia:Wikipedia, is an online wikiencyclopedia of everything. Rather than creating standard links to c2 and wikipedia pages, you can create interwiki links like such

 Guh? 

entering:

{{{wiki:WikiPedia:Poop A page about poop}}}

will give you this

wiki:WikiPedia:Poop A page about poop

If you click on the link, you will be taken to the Wikipedias page on Poop.

 Heres how it works 

  the {{{}}} indicates that what you are typing is a link.
  the {{{wiki:}}} indicates that you are creating a interwiki link regardless of what wiki youre linking to.
  this can be followed by any of the names in the below List of Interwiki places
  then of course you follow with the page name
   A word on page names: c2.com always uses CamelCasingToIndicateSpacesBetweenWords. Wikipedia_is_a_big_fan_of_the_underscore. So {{{wiki:Wiki:APageInTheWiki}}} {{{wiki:WikiPedia:A_Page_In_The_Wiki}}}.
   If youre really picky and anal like Users/ArlenAbraham me then youll want to link to nonredirected pages. For example wiki:WikiPedia:Vacaville Wikipedia:Vacaville redirects to wiki:WikiPedia:Vacaville,_California Wikipedia:Vacaville,_California but doesnt change the URL, you have to take the page name and add the underscores yourself.
  add a space, then type the optional description that you would like to appear with the link.

 Why Bother? 

Well, for one, you get this cool looking interwiki link icon that lets people know theyre going to a wiki and not some random page.  Passing your mouse over the link tells you which wiki it links to.  Furthermore, its good for the connectivity of the wiki as a whole, the theory being that indiviual wikis can all link off each other. Also, they gave Users/ArlenAbraham the oppurtunity to accumulate a shitload of edits for changing like 80% of the outgoing links on the wiki.

 So when do I use this? 
  Suggestion to whoever deals with such things:  Comments created with the comment dialog box probably should be automatically be interwiki links, otherwise eventually there will be a lot of confusion about who is from where and seemingly dead links.  wiki:Davis Wiki:Users/EfremRensi EfremRensi

 Further Reading 
The Wikipedia is an excellent resource for things that we dont necessairily talk about here. It also provides alternate explanations, wiki:WikiPedia:InstantRunoff_Voting InstantRunoff Voting for example, is something that is discussed indepth here at DavisWiki, but DavisWiki cites the wikipedia page as further reading.

 NonDavis topics 
The Videogaming page is an excellent example of wasted effort. Why go through the trouble of writing a history of the videogaming industry when a wiki:WikiPedia:Videogame_industry much better version already exists on the Wikipedia? Theres no need to reinvent the wheel, merely say, for a complete history of the videogame industry, see wiki:WikiPedia:Videogame_industry Wikipedia entry.

  Topics arent nonDavis.  However content might inappropriately be.  I may be in the small minority here (or alone, even), but I think there is virtually no entry topic that should be off limits from DavisWiki.  I think of the DavisWiki as an encyclopedia of things in the world from a Davis perspective.  And even if pages start off genericly, they usually end up very davisspecific.  I bet if someone did entries on the Sun, Moon, Stars, etc., they could all have a uniquely davisspecific flavor.  I think there may be some reason to include wikipedia links in the footer hell, maybe this can be automatically generated if a wikipedia page one exists??  But nothing should inspire someone to say, How does this topic relate to Davis? and respond by deleting the page.  Instead that same person should try and make the page relevant to Davis.  Or at least provide the headings. But thats just my unique perspective.  Users/JaimeRaba

  I get tired of having to defend a few pages I wrote (usually from the same handful of people, over and over again).  I also find it OFFENSIVE to call what I wrote wasted effort (I get to choose what effort I want I want to put into articles).  Just because a book exists in the Library of Congress doesnt mean it doesnt belong in your local library.  Especially when it is obvious that it is an interest to others in the community (just read the comments).  I go further into this on my user page under Grrr.... Users/HollywoOd

 Authority 
Because the Wikipedia is edited and viewed by thousands of people each day, some people claim it is more authoritative than something like DavisWiki.  Niche Wikis like DavisWiki tend to be updated with specifics (find the suppliers of papasan chairs in Davis on Wikipedia or the hours of Thai Bistro) and have local information updated significantly more quickly.  The accuracy of Wikipedia, like any Wiki, can be considered dubious  tests involving insertion of incorrect data shows that it does not get fixed promptly, and is thus subject to subtle trolling.

 Controversy 
Users/JabberWokky maintains that having a linkfest to Wikipedia is not necessarily a positive thing  Wikipedias goals and methods are very different than DavisWiki.  As a result, linking to Wiki for things like DDR would prevent the creation of the current page... which lists local notable players, local groups that hold local tournaments, and a chunk of Davis specific information  including locations of game machines.  DDR itself has little to do with Davis and thus would be a good thing to link to Wikipedia... and in doing so, you decrease the local content hosted here and maintained by Davis focused editors.

A very good example of what should have been linked to Wikipedia are the Flora pages  dozens of pages listing local plantlife.  But by not linking to the Wikipedia entries, we have created pages that contain more information (or more relevant information) than the Wikipedia entries.  In many cases, the local DavisWiki entries list things like what varieties are common locally and where to buy them locally.  There was no reason to create the entries by the Interwiki link philosophy... Wikipedia has perfectly good information... but by not linking, we have increased the value of the local Wiki greatly.

Although, there is some value to the wiki:Wiki:OnceAndOnlyOnce philosophy.  The Labster
   There is also quite a bit of reality to the three precepts of Competition, Focus and Satisfaction.  Following your logic, all entries on DavisWiki should be copied to Wikipedia and DavisWiki shut down.  Seeing pages that could be made here blocked by the easy way out of linking to Wikipedia (even when the Wikipedia entry lacks relevance like wiki:WikiPedia:Richard_Avedon versus Richard Avedon) makes me seriously question the future of this site.  Youve opened a WalMart in the Wiki, where everything is cheaper, even if its shoddy and removes the ability of locals to participate in their own community.  Users/JabberWokky
    No, no, Ben & Jerrys is WalMart.  Silly.  I think local information is best described here, but we shouldnt try to grow to become encyclopedic on things that dont relate to Davis very much.  If articles are covered well on the wikipedia, I think we just need a paragraph of introduction, how it relates to Davis, and a link to the wikipedia for more information.  I dont think we need to refer there for things that are profoundly Davis like, say, Judy Sakaki.  But Ive never tried to define discordianism on this website.  (Besides the rest of them wouldnt agree with me  we Discordians must stick apart!) I never claimed it was my logic, I just claimed the philosophy had some value. Users/BrentLaabs
