This used to be the only, and is now the only remaining, Intramural Fields Intramural (IM) Sports Field on the East side of the UC Davis campus.  It is that mediumlarge green field South of Toomey Field, East of the Hickey Gym, North of the Social Sciences and Humanities Building. It is bordered by A Street on the East side and the North Quad Ave bike path, continuation of 3rd Street, on the South side. It is still primarily used for intramural sports but also hosts special events.
