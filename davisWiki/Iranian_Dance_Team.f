The Iranian Dance Team (IDT) was a nonprofit cultural and educational student organization at UC Davis, founded in 2004 by Sheila Eghbali. As of Fall 2008, the Iranian Dance Team is no longer a distinct student organization affiliated with the university. However, many of the dancers (Davis Iranian Dancers) formally associated with the team continue to teach its members, the campus, and the community about Iranian music, culture, history, geography, costumes, traditions and art through dance.
