  57805 to 63573 Iraqi Civilians reported killed by military intervention in Iraq. (http://www.iraqbodycount.net/) 3/07/07

  President Bush did not declare war until March 2003. Congress did not authorize military action until October 11, 2002. But Bush began an air war six weeks before that authorization and increased spikes of activity five months before. This means that additional communications to Congress from the President, claiming that he had not yet begun the war, may be felonious, and that Bush violated the Constitutional requirement that Congress authorize any war.

  The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction stated that “The intelligence community was dead wrong in almost all of its prewar judgments about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction” (http://www.wmd.gov/report)

  Opposition to Bushs plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq remained strong. Two in three Americans registered their disapproval, with 56 percent saying they strongly object.

  Last week the Bush administration came under heavy fire from a large body of respected scientists who claimed that it cherrypicked science to suit its policy agenda and suppressed studies that it did not like. Jeremy Symons, a former whistleblower at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said that suppression of the report for four months was a further example of the White House trying to bury the threat of climate change.
