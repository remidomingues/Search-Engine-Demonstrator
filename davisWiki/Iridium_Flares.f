Describe Iridium Flares here.

The Iridium satellite network (named so because the constellation of satellites was supposed to have the same number as the atomic weight of Iridium) was the first global sat phone network, it started as a commercial venture and is currently owned by the US military so they can have soldiers be able to call home from anywhere.


But why should you care in Davis California?

Ahh excellent question, you see the way the antenna  on the satellites are pointed make it so that you see a small dot that suddenly grows REALLY REALLY bright for a few seconds before fading away to nothing ness


cool

If you like Iridium Flares, you might be interested in other Stargazing and Space Sightings.


Here is a youtube video of a flare, keep in mind the satellite is moving and not the stars...
