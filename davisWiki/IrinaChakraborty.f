Irina is a grad student at the Scowlab. Dont mess with Irina.

She works in the PES building, but is in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department.

Irina is trying to find the origin of the non fertile (nonfertilized?) eggs that she bought at the Davis Food CoOp yesterday. So far she hasnt been able to find any info on Vega farms in Davis. Irina is disappointed.

Irina found out from a semireliable source that the chickens at Vega farms are probably doing alright.

One of Irinas hobbies is Bharatanatyam at the Experimental College Comments
