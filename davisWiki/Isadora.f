20080612 12:06:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Isadora, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding a review to the Red Orchid Restaurant entry, but you signed it Gary Saylin.  If thats you, you should probably make an account named GarySaylin.  Its kind of like somebody walking into a cafe and introducing themselves with two different names in two minutes  kind of disconcerting.  Also, if you want to learn to edit wiki markup, you can read wiki:wikispot:Help with Editing and play around in the Wiki Sandbox.  If you have any questions, just ask... were here to help.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
