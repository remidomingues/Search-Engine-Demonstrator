Isao Fujimoto is part of the Asian American Studies faculty and Senior Lecturer Emeritus in the  Community and Regional Development department. He was http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Jan10/PhD50Years.html awarded his doctorate by Cornell University in February of 2010, fifty years after his initial enrollment there. The thesis was based on the Central Valley Project, an organization dedicated to share information and strategies among smaller minority farming groups throughout Californias Central Valley. The Colleges apartment  complex has a building named after him, the first and only one in the complex to be named after an Asians Asian person. He was also a featured speaker at the Fall 20072008 Convocation.

Fujimoto is often mentioned as a mentor or inspiration to students. He has taught hundreds in unique courses such as ABS 47, a four day Winter or Spring Break class that takes http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/050396/050396no7.html a group of UCD students to San Franciscos Tenderloin district. This class was originated by Fujimoto and http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id9062 Orville Thompson (of Thompson Hall fame) as a way of teaching undergraduates about communities by direct exposure and interaction.

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, when he first came to UC Davis, Fujimoto helped direct students who were interested in setting up a variety of programs that have since become famous to many people in and outside of Davis. He recalls that about six programs gathered or held their business offices in his house, in including the Farmers Market and Davis Food Coop. As a funny aside, he once asked a person from Davis while he worked at http://www.ncat.org/ The National Center for Appropriate Technology in Butte Montana where he should send people if they want to know more about Davis and its progressive policies, and they gave the address to his house.

His background in California includes moving to the south of San Jose with his family to farm strawberries after being interned at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Mountain_Relocation_Center Heart Mountain, Wyoming and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tule_lake Tule Lake, California during the war.  His family was able to farm on an Indian reservation in Washington, as there was less restriction of Japanese under Native American sovereign government authority.  He  competed as a wrestler while a student at UC Berkeley, and taught high school chemistry in San Jose.
