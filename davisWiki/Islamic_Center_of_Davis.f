The Islamic Center of Davis, or ICD, is a mosque that serves the Islam Muslim community in Davis.  A large portion of the Muslim community is made up of students attending UCD.

The Center offers a variety of services to Muslims in Davis.  In addition to the Congregational daily prayers and the Juma Prayer (Friday sermon), the Center works toward bringing together Muslims through various cultural and social activities. The center also strives to enhance the understanding of Islam among Muslims, as well as endeavors to make Islamic teachings known to interested nonMuslims.

The Muslim Student Association UCD Muslim Student Association meets here as well.

The ICD has been victim to several incidents of vandalism, as well as hate mail. Although the police have painted these incidents as part of drunken mischief, others think the police are not taking these crimes hate crimes seriously enough. In the most costly incident, the ornamental crescent that topped the blue dome was broken off and stolen. See source http://theaggie.org/article/2011/04/26/communityconcernedaboutcrimesatislamiccenter here.  It should be noted that vandalism, especially theft, occurs quite often on Russell Blvd.  Fraternities and Sororities often have letters stolen from their houses (surprisingly expensive to replace) even from rooftops.   This may be related to the theft of the crescent making it questionable as to whether or not it was a hate crime.

The original mosque was established in 1982 by a group of local university students who desired a communal place to pray. They purchased a singlestory house and adapted it for their needs. The number of worshipers eventually outgrew the small space, and the building was demolished in 2006 to make way for a larger replacement.

The current facility of 4000 squarefeet opened its doors in 2008. It contains prayer rooms for men and women, a childrens room, a kitchen, and a library. Visitors of all faiths are welcome.

20111003 10:51:52 nbsp Cant say who, because Im not sure which greek group does it but there is definitely a pledge related theft of emblem type deal on Russell.  Its probable that recurring theft of the crescent is due to that...especially considering the timing of the reports.  Still theft, but not hate inspired theft.  Users/OliviaY
   A dare aspect to the pledge action, I bet. Be quite a challenge climbing the dome and dislodging the crescent in full view of Russell Bl. I remember frat boys living at a Greek house next to a Taco Bell across the sixlane street from the university I went to used to regularly steal the bell. Once they put it on top of a parked police car. Users/RaoulDuke
      Clearly the work of racists who hate Mexicans and they obviously put the bell on top of the car to symbolically tell the cops to deport them. Users/hankim
    To clear the air (pu): Taco Bell is not Mexican. The bell on the car made it very clear to the cops what exactly had transpired.   Users/RaoulDuke
