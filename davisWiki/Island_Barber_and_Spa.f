 December 2011 I am sorry to inform you that the Island Barber and Spa is temporarily closed. We will hopefully reopen at some point in the future with a new location. We apologize for the inconvenience and we appreciate your business. We will be updating you on new information shortly. Robin Graham (Owner)


The Island Barber Spa wss a unique place where men, women, and children were all welcome. The Spa was dedicated to each customerâ€™s grooming needs. Men could enjoy their own private space and a menu of services, including a hot towel shave that ensured optimal comfort and skin care needs.

Each staff member at the Spa was extremely proficient with the straight razor. Established protocol at the Spa guaranteed the closest againstthegrain shave without razor burn or causing ingrown hairs. Each customer would receive a perfect shave, whether they had a tough beard or sensitive skin.

The owners also hosted classes on how to shave yourself with a straight razor, after working formally at The Art of Shaving in San Francisco. Together, the owners have more than 20 years experience in the hair and skin care industry and have worked in the highend beauty business from coast to coast.
