Island InkJet was a store in the University Mall in front of Gottschalks that refilled ink cartridges for cheaper than it would cost to buy new cartridges.  They were featured in a California Aggie http://www.californiaaggie.com/home/index.cfm?eventdisplayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_idd683272cd4474e5f9c7d0eb107beb938 article.  Cheaper and more Recycling environmentally friendly. They closed down in November, 2006.

Check out Aggie Express which is located right next to where Island InkJet used to be.  They offer a variety of inkjet cartridges as well as refill toner cartridges at reasonable prices.  You can swap your empty ink cartridge with a professionally refilled and print tested one of the same kind without any wait time.

You can also get ink cartridges for around $1 to $4 each online, but be careful: some shipping charges are high enough so that you need to order quite a few for it to be worthwhile.


20050525 10:34:26 nbsp Ive used these guys once and so far am happy with the results.  They use different ink depending on your brand of printer and clean the catridge heads.  I had both color and black filled and cleaned for around $30. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20061104 14:48:41 nbsp Youd better hurry up if you want to get your cartridge refilled.  They are closing down November 15, 2006.  Good prices and they fill your cartridge to capacity, unlike when you buy one. Users/SlutMan

20061228 17:29:37 nbsp Now that theyre gone I need and want them. Just like a relationship. Users/AliceChoe

20070116 14:53:01 nbsp Im sad now that theyre closed. I went in to have some cartridges refilled today and just kind of stood there moping around for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do. Users/AndrewLeonard

20070222 18:11:13 nbsp I did the same thing today, Andrew! Does anyone know of another place to refill ink cartridges? I need one. :( Users/NumiaCairaguas

20070320 16:21:25 nbsp Closed? Noooo! I guess Ill have to exchange these things for paper at Office Max instead. Users/KarlMogel

       Office Max does not do that anymore.  They just take 3 dollars off your purchase now.
