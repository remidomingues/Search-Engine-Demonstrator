This is a weekly radio stations radio public affairs show on KDVS, hosted by France Kassing (n√©e France Senecal).

It airs every Monday morning from 8:30am to 9:30am. The show usually follows an interview format each week (although not always). France does quite a lot of research for each show, and if her guest has written a book that is discussed on the show, shes almost always read the whole book before hand (which may seem like only common courtesy, but you would be surprised how often this isnt the case in the world of mainstream radio). The show does have a fairly liberal bent to it, but France works hard to be acurate and to have well thoughtout commentary. The show is well known for high caliber guests that France is able to get for the show; former guests include the likes of Howard Zinn and Larry Lessig.

The show has a (seldom updated) http://kdvsitsaboutyou.blogspot.com/ blog and a http://feeds.feedburner.com/ItsAboutYou podcast linked to from the blog. The blog mainly acts as a summary of each weeks show for those who want to grab the archive.


As the initial creator of this page, I should disclaim that Im not exactly an impartial party here. I volunteer as an engineer for the show (mainly filling out logs and such). I do however honestly think that the show is quite remarkably good (hence part of the reason why I stay volunteering when I dont plan to have my own show).  Users/EricKlein
