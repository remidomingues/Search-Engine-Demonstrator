An Italian Soda is a delicious beverage created by mixing Torani (or a similar brand of) flavored syrup with carbonated water. Several Davis establishments serve them in a variety of flavors, and you can get creative and have them mix flavors together, as well.  Flavors (and ability to skillfully mix flavors) do vary somewhat.

Davis Serving Establishments

   Ciocolat
    Prices: $2 one size
    Flavors: (Note: Monin brand, not Torani) Vanilla, Sugarfree Raspberry, Frosted Mint, Irish Cream, Coconut
    Mixing Ability:
     Handsdown best in Davis Ive ever had. They actually cared about the sugar content (ironically enough) and mixed it at much lower strength per flavor because it was a combination. Users/AnsateJones
   Crepeville
    Prices: $2 one size
    Flavors: Blueberry, Creme de Menthe, Kiwi, Cinnamon, Strawberry, Cherry, Irish Cream, Coconut, Amaretto, Apricot, Vanilla, Orgeat, Peach
    Mixing Ability:
     Warning: They tend to leave the actual mixing (stirring) up to the customer. Otherwise they do a great job, although theyll give you odd looks if youre a crazy flavor combiner like me. Users/AnsateJones
   Delta of Venus
    Prices: $1.50 for the seltzer water, then 50 cents per flavor shot added on.
    Flavors: Blackberry, Caramel, Coconut, Hazelnut, Irish Cream, Kiwi, Lime, Mango, Orgeat, Peach, Peppermint, Pomegranate, Raspberry, Strawberry, Sugar Free Vanilla, Vanilla
    Mixing Ability: Probably depends on whos making it.
     They tend to err on the side of too sugary in my opinion.  They are very conscientious about it though and will remix it if you have a problem. Users/AnsateJones
   Cafe Roma (both campus and downtown locations)
    Prices: $2 one size
    Flavors:
     Campus: Cherry, Almond Roca, Coconut, Hazelnut, Irish Cream, Creme de Menthe
     Downtown: Cherry, Almond Roca, Coconut, Hazelnut, Irish Cream
    Mixing Ability:
     The one time I got a soda with Creme de Menthe at Campus Roma, the Creme de Menthe was much too strong.  The Espresso Roma was able to handle one with Hazelnut and Irish Cream pretty well. Users/AnsateJones

Recommended Combinations

    Cherry, Almond Roca, Coconut Delightfully nutty, fruity concoction. Pleasing red color. Users/AnsateJones
    The Avada Kedavra (Creme de Menthe, Chocolate, Hazelnut) This one looks like the Draught of Death but if mixed correctly (not too much Creme de Menthe) it is a minty nutty paradise.  Can you tell I like nuts? Users/AnsateJones

Please add to the lists!


Sometimes the sodas sauce is mixed prior to getting it, and other times its not mixed and is just at the bottom (e.g. Mishkas).  Which is preferred to an Italian soda expert?
