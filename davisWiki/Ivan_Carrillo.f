 Winter 2008 Candidate Statement 
Hello fellow students, our names are Ivan Carrillo and Molly Fluet and we are running with the L.E.A.D. slate for ASUCD President and VicePresident. Over the past three years the L.E.A.D. Executive Office has responsibly balanced and structured our 10 million dollar ASUCD budget to provide students with an increased quality of services. L.E.A.D. has also significantly improved advocacy on the city and state levels to ensure our student concerns are heard and respected. We are committed to this L.E.A.D. tradition of building a stronger student association, and plan to improve the quality of student life, develop student leaders and outreach to all communities.

One out of every five students at U.C. Davis does not graduate. To make sure students graduate we will do the following; first, we would like to make a resource catalog that houses all of the services on campus in one convenient place. Second, we want to establish seminars for all grade levels so that students can make minimum progress requirements and attain knowledge that is pertinent to their success. Lastly, we want to publish the professor evaluations online, so students can make informed decisions about their academic classes.

The quality of student life is important to having a positive college experience. We will work with other organizations on campus to have a safeboat at the annual houseboats weekend. This safeboat will provide water and sunscreen and more importantly have constant contact with emergency services in case of trouble. Also, as five other UC’s already have, we will try to bring “Zipcar” to campus. This would be an affordable and convenient car rental service for 18 and over Aggies.

The State of California is facing a 14 billion dollar short fall and cuts to the UC system are already in the works. As passionate, student advocates, we promise that we will be in the State Capitol fighting for such issues as tuition relief, financial aid, and outreach programs. Also, on campus we will be working with the administration to make sure that the quality of our education is not affected by these budget cuts.

We will continue to represent the best interests of students on all levels. We urge you to take part in building a stronger Student Association by voting for Ivan Carrillo and Molly Fluet to be your ASUCD President and VicePresident. Thank You and GO L.E.A.D.!!!

Winter 2007 Candidate Statement
My name is Iván Carrillo and I am a third year transfer student from Sacramento. I am a sociology major with a minor in social and ethnic relations. Throughout life I have been educated on social justice issues by family, friends, my community, teachers, peers, and mentors. This education as well as discrimination that I have witnessed and experienced has created a consciousness of many injustices within our society. I am driven by a passion to work towards achieving social justice. This drive includes working on issues within our campus that will in turn affect our community.

I am convinced that I can make the biggest change and have the most influence on campus through ASUCD and collaborations with campus centers. As an ASUCD senate candidate there are a few issues that I am focusing my platform on. The main issue is retention. We all come to school with the aspirations of graduating but unfortunately many students who come to UC Davis do not graduate. There are many things that affect retention. Many of these things can be addressed and solved if students were better informed.

There are many resources that if taken advantage of can be the difference in someone graduating and someone not graduating. My main focus would be to bring awareness to them and make them easily accessible for all students. We have to increase funding to campus centers so they are able to promote themselves and offer more services. We also need to have events (ie: resource fairs) repeatedly which would bring these resources and their representatives directly to the students. These events would be set up where it is easy for students to learn about what and where resources are offered. Another way to bring exposure is through advertisement. This includes better signs so centers are easy to find, having flyers, posters, A boards, and articles in school publications which would promote and inform students of resources offered on campus.
