20090112 16:41:07 nbsp Hi Izz, Im glad you feel that way and have had a positive experience there, but I really didnt and I have never been satisfied with that apartment complex.  The gym there doesnt work, the lighting is bad, there may be space but since then, Ive moved to Primero Grove, and theres enough space AND cheaper rent. Glad youre happy Users/renee415
