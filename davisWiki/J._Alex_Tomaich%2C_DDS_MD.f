20061031 17:41:11 nbsp This oral surgeon treated my son when he had to get his wisdom teeth extracted.  It went extremely well. My son was given light sedation and the procedure was done quickly. There was no problems with insurance coverage or billing.  The office staff were very friendly, yet professional.  I highly recommend this dental surgeon.  Users/SharlaDaly

20070206 14:04:15 nbsp I had a wisdom tooth extracted by Dr. Tomaich yesterday and had a positive experience  at least as positive an experience as having a wisdom tooth extracted can be!  He and his staff were both very nice and very skillful.  And yesterday evening Dr. Tomaich himself called me to see how I was feeling.  Hopefully I wont ever require Dr. Tomaichs services again, but if I do I will not hesitate to return to his office. Users/AmandaSmith

20070529 18:11:00 nbsp Dr.Tomaich and his staff are super friendly and very professional! He is highly educated and great at what he does. My experiences there were very positive despite the fact that I had multiple surgeries. I dont think I will but if need be I wouldnt hesitate either to be a patient of his again.  Users/JamieWagner

20070622 20:44:36 nbsp Im in Davis for school, and had to get my wisdom teeth out. This place seemed the most promising because of the good comments and ratings.

The office is very clean, the staff people are very friendly, and I never had to wait long to be seen. I only had to take one XRay that was quick and painless since I did not bring in an XRay of my own.

The best thing about this place is that the dentist himself called me to make sure I was ok after my surgery. He also left a number where he could be reached 24/7, and I actually had to use it to call him because of some pain issues I was having due to dry sockets, which Im pretty sure the dentist couldnt stop from happening. I really enjoy that personal touch and that I feel like I got my moneys worth by being able to ask all the questions I wanted, and to have my dentist be there if I had issues. Overall, good place. Users/CAkita

20070713 14:59:50 nbsp I had two bottom wisdom teeth taken out by Dr. Tomaich, and had a good experience  I dont remember a thing! He gave me a call later that evening to check up on me. However, I did have one dry socket a few days later, but was able to go in to have it treated right away, and the pain subsided.  The staff is friendly, and the office is clean and tidy. Id recommend this place. Users/at86
 How was the dry socket treated? Its good to see there was some quick relief  Users/StevenDaubert
   I had dry socket also, Dr. Tomaich inserts a herbal paste(?) into the socket which numbs the socket.  Didnt taste that great, but did the job. AmyLee
     The herbal paste  is a compound containing antibacterial agents and oil of clove (eugenol). The eugenol is the active ingredient and its primary activity is analgesia (pain relief). Users/DagonJones

20070910 00:37:59 nbsp I have had my wisdom teeth pulled out two different (once uppers and second time bottoms) times by Dr. Tomaich.  Both experiences were flawless.  The UC Delta plan works well with Dr. Tomiachs office.  Cynthia Saths description of her own experience reminds me of my own. Thanks Dr. Tomaich!!! Users/AmyLee

20070913 15:48:46 nbsp I had a nightmarish extraction when I was 17 (not at this office), so put off the second one 7 years! My lower wisdom tooth was impacted (covered up by jaw bone) and turned sideways. I had evals with 3 dentists, because I wanted the best chance at success this time around. I chose Dr. Tomaichs office because of his superior training, the great comments here, and, honestly, because when we met I could tell hes quite conscientious and careful. Im sorry, but Id rather have a younger doctor who is invested in what hes doing than someone with 50 years experience who is blase, with a seen that, done that attitude. My instincts proved right in the operating room. Dr. T worked tirelessly on my extraction, even taking multiple xrays afterwards to make sure he got all of the root. There was still some left, so back he went to get the last of it. Not a picnic, but much better than leaving dead tooth in there! Im a week out from surgery now and healing great. I know that I might be considered a tough patient, as I came in with some past trauma, asked TONS of questions (as only a grad student knows how LOL), requested being awake and only under local anesthesia, gripped the chair like my life depended on it, etc. Though I think I amused them a little, the whole staff was patient, responsive, positive and highly skilled. In summary, I want to give my HIGHEST recommendation to this office, and to Dr. Tomaich in particular. He seems to me to have the skills PLUS the caring to be a truly exemplary doctor. (PSThis is just my opinion, but I think I healed super well because I took lots of vitamins C, B, zinc and magnesium postop, and avoided sugary junk foods! Just FYI!) :) Good luck! Users/JessicaH

20071011 17:05:01 nbsp I had my wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Tomiach and it went really well.  He is really good at what he does.  The whole staff was pleasant and helpful.  A little while after my surgery my brother had his done here too, and all went well with that one too!  We would definitely recommend him!  Users/Danya

20080131 12:05:38 nbsp Dr. Tomaich is an excellent surgeon.  As a dentist, when I refer a patient to him I know they will recieve the best of care.  I have the highest confidence in his ability and skill.  He also has an excellent staff that are very friendly and pleasant to deal with. Users/DagonJones

20080627 23:50:04 nbsp I would enthusiastically recommend Dr. Tomaich for tooth extractions.  I had mine done two weeks ago, and it was a very quick and painless (noI am not exaggerating) procedure.  Since I had some negative dental experiences as a child, I was very afraid of having wisdom teeth extracted, plus Im much older than most patients having wisdom teeth removed, so I had a number of concerns.  Dr. Tomaich patiently put up with my many questions, answering them and putting my mind at ease.  Because of my fear, he used deep sedation (putting me to sleep temporarily, via an IV), and that was literally the most uncomfortable element of the entire procedure (the needle stick). I followed his directions to the letter, postop, and had no complications, and no pain to speak of.  Dr. Tomaich phoned me the evening of my surgery, making sure everything was alright, and reassuring me that if I had problems, they would be taken care of very rapidly.  His office staff were also extremely helpful, and very patient as well, since I had several postop questions and phoned several times during recovery.  His office staff filed everything with my insurance companies, and there have been zero problems. I recommend Dr. Tomaich without reservations. Users/KendraSmith

20080708 21:40:12 nbsp I recently had a tooth extraction at Dr. Tomaichs office and it went wonderful!  His office staff was amazing and so reassuring about the whole procedure.  Dr. Tomaich explained the options for sedation and anesthetic for my procedure and allowed me to be my own advocate and decide what I was most comfortable with.  I explained to him my fear of the dentist and how it is directly due to the fact that it is extremely difficult for me to become numb, instantly he took a proactive approach of informing me that he will hit the area with all possible numbing agents and that he was farily confident that he would be successful.  During the procedure I was beyond scared and really his nurse Maria was extremely soothing.  It wsa done fairly quickly and before I knew it I was on my way home.  To further help me through the process he called me a few hours laters asking how I was feeling and if I had any additional questions.  Dr. Tomaich and his staff were incredible and an easy recommendation to give. Users/karrie

20080710 12:37:35 nbsp I had 3 wisdom teeth removed at Dr. Tomaichs office recently and the experience couldnt have been better (considering I was having teeth removed). They are very professional and kind and I had minimal pain after the surgery. The Doctor also called me later that evening to check on how I was doing. They also let me take a copy of my Xray to my next dental appointment, which saves over 100 dollars, but which every dentist doesnt allow you to do.
I didnt understand one of the comments about being surprised about what you were charged they give you the bill way ahead of time so there are no surprises. For me, they said they were giving me a discount because I have a pretty bad UC Davis insurance policy. All in all, I highly recommend this oral surgeon. Users/Rowena


20080916 22:34:05 nbsp I had my upper wisdom teeth removed in August and the procedure itself went very smoothly. I had no problems and they have healed great. Dr. Tomaich did a great job. I wish I could say the same for his billing staff. They neglected to tell that my insurance had not covered my initial consult (which was over a month before the actual procedure) until the day before my surgery (because I called with a question about my antibiotics). Had I not called the woman in the office told me she would have informed me the day of my surgery (unprofessional). When I asked how much the surgery would be exactly they said they could not give me an exact amount until the claim was submitted to my insurance. I spoke with my insurance co. and they informed me it is customary for Dr.s offices that can not give an exact amount to submit a prior authorization before performing and nonemergency procedures. The prior authorization lets the insurance company give the Dr.s office an exact break down of what will be covered by the insurance and what the patient will be responsible for. (This office chose not to do this). Furthermore when I finally got the bill in the mail it gave me only a balance due amount without an actual breakdown of services rendered. I had to call my insurance company to find out how the fees were broken down. I worked in prescription billing in a pharmacy for 2 years and the way they handled the situation seemed inappropriate to me.  Users/dds1372

After posting this message the office and I worked it out and I am happy with the outcome. (I would still recommended talking to your insurance company before having any kind medical procedure done. )  Users/dds1372

20081003 18:53:19 nbsp I had a procedure done by Dr. Tomaich recently and he as well as his entire staff took very good care of me.   Users/EJones

20081113 14:39:55 nbsp I am an UC Davis student and my lower right wisdom tooth was infected during spring quarter 08. The infection was so bad that I felt dizzy and my cheek swelled up like a balloon. I was referred to Tomaichs center from a local dentist and had an operation within 2 days. Dr. Tomaich gave me a tranq shot and pulled the wisdom tooth out very quickly. After the infected wisdom tooth got pulled out, I made a rapid recovery. My student insurance covered almost all of the operation, so I only had to pay less than $50 out of my own pocket. There were no hassels over the insurance, everything went smooth. Overall, I had a good experiance at Tomaichs center and would recommend him to any student in need of an operation.  Users/justinhu

20090330 04:20:33 nbsp Im also a UCD student and had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed here a few weeks ago. I was very nervous before the surgery, but Dr. Tomaich is extremely qualified as a dental surgeon, being both a dentist and a medical doctor. Hell answer any questions and concerns you have, and will make sure you are comfortable before, during, and after the surgery. His staff even provided me with a warm blanket after the surgery because I was cold. I didnt feel any pain the day of the surgery and any minor pain I had after was quickly relieved by the prescriptions provided. My biggest fear was getting dry socket, but thankfully I didnt because I followed his postop instructions down to every word. If you do your part, your wisdom teeth extractions will be as smooth as possible. His office is state of the art, and is coupled with a very friendly staff. One thing you should note is that if you are considering getting your wisdom teeth removed here you should call asap because Dr. Tomaich is very popular in town. Users/DannyT

20100606 23:56:29 nbsp For students under the SHIP plan, how much did you pay?  I need to get two wisdom teeth removed... Users/strawberry
  Im on GSHIP, but our coverage is the same.  I had three wisdom teeth removed earlier this year, and Delta paid 90% (including general anesthesia) up to the $850 cap.  I wound up paying just over $500 out of pocket after the insurance hit the max.  Depending on your teeth  are they impacted, etc since that costs more  and if you go without general anesthesia, it seems plausible to get two removed and keep it under Deltas $850 cap, meaning youd only pay 10%.  Best of luck!  The experience wasnt half as bad as I had worked it up in my head prior to the surgery, and Dr. Tomaich was great. Users/StaceyEllis

20100715 11:44:16 nbsp Ive been to Dr. Tomiachs office a number of times for a number of different procedures including two mucocele removals and wisdom teeth removal. Each visit reinforced my confidence in his work and the work of his staff. The office is great, everyones friendly, and Dr. Tomiach does great work. I highly recommend Dr. Tomiach for anyone looking for an oral and maxillofacial surgeon! Users/AlexanderSlizeski

20110331 22:24:37 nbsp I would highly recommend this dentist and his excellent staff.  I was so happy with my experience that I almost sent them a thank you note!  I have GSHIP and had already used up some of my allotted money for the year so after seeing what needed to be done, they explained everything that would happen and gave me different quotes (to either include or not another tooth I needed pulled but which wasnt a wisdom tooth.  No one pressured me to do the more expensive thing (getting all the teeth pulled I needed/wanted to or going under anesthesia) although that was what I chose.  Even so, I only ended up paying $100 out of pocket (since I went over the amount GSHIP pays). The nurse who prepped me was so nice, the aftercare was excellent and my followup a week later was quick and went smoothly.  My gums healed without a problem and I highly recommend Dr. Tomaich.

20110708 09:17:05 nbsp We had an awesome experience here. They took wonderful care of our daughter. Very happy with the Dr as well as the staff!  Users/LisaBulish

20120124 11:14:35 nbsp               A week after getting 4 of my wisdom teeth taken out by Dr.Tomaich and his friendly staff, I just had to go back and take them some baked goods to show my appreciation for making my wisdom teeth extraction such a pleasant experience. From the minute I walked in to the office Monday morning, until I was helped out to my vehicle that afternoon after the procedure was done I felt completely safe and comfortable. I have to say that although I was asleep during the procedure, I am sure it went smoothly because my recovery has been a breeze. On top of being extremely helpful with the insurance coverage and financial aspect of the procedure, they also gave me the proper tools and directions for posttreatment care. I was even helped out to my vehicle since I was still a bit drowsy from the local anesthetic. I spoke to several friends who told me that taking 4 wisdom teeth out at once would be a painful and brutal experience with a lot of swelling and at least two days of recovery time. I experienced the opposite! I had minimal swelling, I was pain free most of the time (with an exception of soreness in the jaw), and I was talking normally within hours. My mother had her wisdom teeth taken out a couple years back and she told me that the feeling in her tongue did not return for several months after. I had all my feeling back within 4 hours of the surgery!
               I am planning on having two more major procedures done in this office and I look forward to working with Dr. Tomaich and his staff. I know that I will be under the care of a knowledgeable, experienced, and professional staff, not to mention super friendly!  Users/MariaPlasencia

20120503 15:05:59 nbsp Just got out of Alexs office.  Best experience I have ever had at dentist, and I have seen a lot of dentists. A++++ Users/danaaa

20130102 19:53:15 nbsp Be careful of the extra charges one month after your surgery! Besides my insurance, I paid $890 out of pocket before my surgery (extracted four wisdom teeth and one decayed teeth). I only did the surgery because it’s under my budget. Otherwise I would quote with another surgeon. However one month later, the financial coordinator asked me to pay $314 more and said my insurance did not cover the amount she estimated previously. She did not give me a clear explanation for it, and was giving me a hard time.  She kept saying staffs like “I dont understand you” or “ if you do not pay this money in 30 days, I would send the bill to a collecting company.”  Its a really frustrated experiences talking with her.  Also I wish she could have explained the possible extra charges before the surgery or ask me to consult my insurance company if she is not sure about my insurance policy. Except billing issues, I think Dr.Tomaich has done the surgery really well. I did not feel any pain during the teeth extraction and I recovered without any problems.  Users/annezhang
 Unfortunately, thats the nature of health (and dental) insurance companies.  Its not uncommon for them to underpay the care provider.  There will usually be some backandforth between the care provider and the insurance company as the provider tries to get paid, but its often unsuccessful.  Its a crappy situation, but its probably not the fault of Dr. Tomaich or anyone at his office. I dont know anything about his practice; its just all too common a situation where insurance providers are involved. Users/TomGarberson
