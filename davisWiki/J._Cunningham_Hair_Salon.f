20070718 08:18:22 nbsp Im not a DAC member and Ive had my hair cut there many times. Users/DougWalter


20100530 17:50:01 nbsp This is the ONLY place I will ever have my hair done. Ive been getting my hair cut by Juanita since I was 3 years old (Im now 27) and no one else touches my hair  if you knew me, youd know that I am very vain about my hair ) She is amazing and is really a true artist. She is very precise and knows how to give you the hair cut/color you want but at the same time, flatter your facial features and your normal daily hair care. Her coloring is amazing  shes done highlights, lowlights, from brunette to bright blonde on me. Jean and Juanita are amazing. I highly recommend them. My entire family, my boss, my coworkers, my friends, etc. get their hair done here! Sorry you had a bad experience Beth. They dont have a receptionist (There are only Jean and Juanita there  sometimes even just one of them) and they pride themselves on trying to serve everybody. Call in advance because they literally book up pretty fast  especially holidays, prom time & summer cuts. Highly recommended here! Users/ElizabethKelly

20100728 21:33:50 nbsp When you go in ask for Jordan I got my hair cut done by her today  and it turned out perfect ive never looked so good. she was young, had great style, very pretty by the way and was very friendly, she shampood my hair and even threw in a free wax without me even asking. Shes the real deal good experience Ill defenintly go back! Way  better then cheap fake ol stylist at great clips or super cuts who leave uncut patches in your head and have to go back the next day to make it even again (so ridiculous).   Users/AaronY

20120424 17:54:40 nbsp Im a DAC member and have heard good things about Jean and was surprised to see there were so few reviews on this site. I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. Jean washed and cut my hair for $35. She took her time and did a very good job. Jean mentioned that I could return in a couple of weeks for a free neck shave. Aside from being very skilled, Jean is a great conversationalist.  Users/nowhereman
