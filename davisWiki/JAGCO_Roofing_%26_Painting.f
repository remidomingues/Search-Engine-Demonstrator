JAGCO Roofing & Painting does roof inspections, crawl space repair and works on wood, asphalt, metal and foam roofs, doing repair and waterproofing.  Presumably they do some painting as well, although if it is just roofs that are painted is unknown.

20100206 12:20:59 nbsp Immediate and thorough diagnosis of the problem with my gutters not draining properly.  Solved the difficulty by cleaning out debris that caused backup over the flashings.  I was very satisfied with the fast, thorough service and reasonable fee. Users/barbaraclutter

20120926 09:35:24 nbsp JAGCO is awesome.  Seriously.  We desperately needed a new roof and they worked within our budget.  Even took the time to teach us about roofing.  JAGCO, is quick, efficient, professional and reasonably priced!  What more can be asked in this tough economy?  I would highly recommend them to anyone and willing to show my house as a sample of their work.  Just call JAGCO and they will take care of the rest!  :) Users/christinebonilla

20131012 15:16:12 nbsp Joe has done a couple repairs on our roof, both times he responded quickly with good service and was very reasonably priced.  He also gave me a good referral for a tree service (Davis Tree Works). Users/Dr.Baker
