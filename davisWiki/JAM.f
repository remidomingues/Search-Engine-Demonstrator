JAM was initially designed as a mnemonic developed by Joel Juarez, Abrham CastilloRuiz, and their running partner who did not make the cut, Maribel, in order to help people remember which candidates to vote for, but in the process became their slate. If its not clear yet, the J, A, and M are the first letters in their names.

Vote JAM! is backed by Mo Torres, Laura Pulido, and Sergio Blanco among others. Many of these individuals were formerly part of LEAD but feel their interests and the interests of their communities have not been met by the current LEAD slate. These individuals represent the CCC, SRRC, WRRC, and LGBTRC, among other groups and organizations on campus.

JAM was created in the 2009/2010 academic year.
