Welcome to the wiki!

You can post mystery pictures any time.  Usually we wait for the current one to be guessed.  If you go to edit the mystery picture page there are instructions on what to do.  You should move the old pictures to the archive page first. If you have more questions just ask, I am happy to help.  Btw, that is very cool that a band is named Dagon Dagon,  I will have to look that up.Users/DagonJones
