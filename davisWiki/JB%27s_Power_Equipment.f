20080630 15:57:18 nbsp I had a great experience with JBs, and in particular Brad. Instead of taking my lawnmower in for fixing, Brad spent a couple of minutes with it and then told me how to fix it myself, which was very easy. He saved me a bunch of money, I learned something, and I got my mower back the same day. Thanks! Users/LisaKrebs

20080630 16:26:44 nbsp I havent had any business interactions with JBs, but I have noticed lots of power equipment tossed at the recycling center that can be made to operate with just a few minutes of work.  Before tossing that power mower or rototiller, think about having these guys look at it. Users/JimStewart

20120610 22:56:16 nbsp JBs is such a great place. Not only is Davis really lucky to still have a real mower and chain shop, but this is a terrific business. Ive brought them my little chainsaw for a new chain, and theyve sharpened our reel push mower a couple of times. Each time, quick service, great results. Users/NicoleR
