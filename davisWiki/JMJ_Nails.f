After reading the study that found that the jet bowls are hard to clean and can breed bacteria, I feel more comfortable with their setup.  I asked for a French manicure and it was beautiful and the leg/foot massage was excellent.  The staff is friendly. The whole experience made of a relaxing and enjoyable day off. Users/ACA
