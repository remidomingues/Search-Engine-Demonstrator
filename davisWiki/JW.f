20090206 15:19:48 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. W, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the huge, detailed reviews youve been writing lately... you know you can just click the Edit icon and edit the entry directly.  Many of the points you make are relevant to everybody, and it would be great if they were in the main entry itself.  Dont be afraid to edit the entry itself  if somebody else has a different opinion, they can also edit and add it to the entry.  Rather than a review, help everybody by creating an actual entry... be brave!  Every entry on the entire wiki was written by people like you doing that. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
