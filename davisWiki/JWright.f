Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for uploading a picture to Patrol Plus Private Security. You might want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. You removed the list of local apartment complexes that use Patrol Plus services, but didnt offer an explanation as to why. Not every complex has security and of those that do, they dont all necessarily use Patrol Plus, so it is relevant to list the ones that do. (If the list isnt complete/accurate, help make it so it is!) Its also what makes the article pertinent to Davis  otherwise its just an article about a business in Roseville. Usually, we dont make unsigned I ... statements in the article, because it gets confusing to read  those are better placed in the comments box. And, although I dont think any harm was done this time, its generally considered bad form to edit someone elses comments in the comments box because, to the casual reader, it looks like that person said something that they didnt! That said, I hope you continue to make positive contributions; welcome! Users/RyanCoates
