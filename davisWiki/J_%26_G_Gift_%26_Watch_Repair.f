J & G Gift & Watch Repair sells and repairs watches (including replacing watch batteries and cracked watch crystals) for very reasonable prices.  They also sell a lot of little gift shops knick knacks and tchatchkes (including lighters and pocket knives).  The staff are very friendly and helpful.

It is located in County Fair Mall in wiki:Woodland, near the inside entry to Mervyns. Yolobus lines http://www.yolobus.com/42.html 42 and http://www.yolobus.com/242.html 242 will take you there, as will a short drive North on Highway 113.


20090526 22:54:51 nbsp Dont shop here! Took two watches for repair and one broke a month later after I ONLY wore it one time. Returned for a refund or another repair, but he COULDNT guaranteed his work. WTF??? The owner just wants your money. With that kind of stores, no wonder the county fair mall is empty most of the days. Users/alexmex1981

20090705 14:41:24 nbsp Ive replaced a number of watch batteries here, but recently started noticing the batteries didnt last as long. I had the scratched crystal on my Fossil watch replaced for ~$40.  A month later, it cracked. My guess is the replacement face was cheap glass, not real crystal.  Its too bad theyre skimping on materials, as now I wont be back.  And I was originally very happy with this place too! Users/MichaelMacIntosh
