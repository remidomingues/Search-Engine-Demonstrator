J Street Apartments one and twobedroom apartments ranging from $950/month to $1210/month with a $500 pet deposit February 2013. Under previous management, accessories for the pool table were frequently broken or missing but were replaced within a reasonable length of time. New management is taking a proactive approach to this problem by making sure extra supplies are onhand. Parking is abundant on the south end of the complex (left side if facing the complex from the street) and requires no registration or sticker. It was noted that previous management were often seen riding around on a golf cart.

As with locations all over Davis, notably East Davis, one downside are the train tracks just behind the complex which can periodically be a source of considerable noise.  Mailboxes are outside the north door of the clubhouse building which is nice for those times when they lock it up and you cant get in.  The Unitrans E bus line stops right in front of the complex and drops you off at the Memorial Union bus terminal.

In March, 2013, a complete change of staffing happened at J Street Apartments. Old comments have been archived for historical reference here: J Street Apartments  Pre2013 Management Change Reviews
