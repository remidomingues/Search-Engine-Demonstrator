J Street Coop is one of the Cooperative housing cooperative houses in Davis.  Both J Street and its sibling coops, Cornucopia Corner Coop Cornucopia Corner Coop and sunwise coop Sunwise, are managed by the Solar Community Housing Association, a nonprofit organization whose board is comprised mainly of current and former J Street, Cornucopia Corner Coop Cornucopia Corner Coop, and Sunwise coop Sunwise members.

J Street Coop is in east davis Old East Davis, in a house built in the 1920s.  The house was the former location of the Davis Art Center and was converted back to housing through a selfhelp remodeling effort that included raising the roof and adding additional living space.  Currently, the house is about 2,400 square feet (not counting its basement) and contains seven bedrooms (two downstairs, five upstairs), two bathrooms (one upstairs, one downstairs), a kitchen, sunroom, living room, dining room, back deck, office landing, and a fantastic front porch.  Unfortunately, the house does not presently incorporate any solar technologies but did have a Chalkboard at 3rd and J chalkboard for a while.


J Street offers accommodations for one and twoperson households.  At full capacity, the house fits around eight people.  The coop has typically been home to a strong contingent of UC Davis undergraduate students undergraduate and graduate students and people working for the UC Davis University, but the coop is open to anyone who makes less than $42,500 per year (as of 2011).  The Coop is a low income housing opportunity and an equal opportunity housing provider with an emphasis on cooperative living, community dinners, and making decisions by modified consensus.  Member obligations include: one cook night a week (with another cook), household chores, two house meetings per month, and monthly work parties.  We eat dinner together at 7pm Monday  Thursday.  Please feel free to join us some time!  In addition to our residential house members, the Coop usually takes on one to three boarders, people who eat dinner with the house and take on a cook night per week (with a partner or two).  We accept applications for new house members whenever a spot opens up in our house (well make an announcement on this Wiki page and on other community boards).

J Street Coop is a member of the Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA), and the http://nasco.coop/ North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO).  We shop at the Davis Food Coop Davis Food Coop.

J Street has several rooms opening up in Summer 2014! Come by and get to know us!

20100430 19:26:03 nbsp J Street Coop is an amazing house filled with wonderful people. I didnt know much about coops until I moved to Davis, but J Street is a great example of how a group of people can share space/resources and make it work. Ive lived in Davis for almost four years now, but my best memories are spending time with friends on the porch. If you are interested in getting involved in the coop community, or just want to meet some really cool people, stop by for dinner some night. You wont regret it and might just end up with some friends for life. Users/Bob413
