Jacks Urban Eats is a arriving businesses new restaurants restaurant in The Marketplace.  They primarily serve sandwiches, salads, carved meats, chicken strips, and fries.  It is part of a small, local chain that includes locations in Sacramento, Roseville, Folsom, etc. The food is quite similar to Plutos.

As can be seen in the picture, Jacks has outdoor seating.

This location, now Suite #119, takes up the former Suite #120 (where Angel Eye Care & Family Optometry was before it moved) and part of the former Suite #119  (Leslies Pool Supplies takes up the rest of the former #119 and is now numbered #119A).



20130512 12:48:28 nbsp Tried this place twice now.  The sandwiches are pretty good but the price kills it for me.  A sandwich w/ a drink and regular sized garlic/urban fries will run you $15 and change.  Ill stick to Plutos where theres a very similar menu & noticeably better prices.

But if you dont mind spending a few extra bucks and the location is convenient then give Jacks a try. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20130512 14:36:47 nbsp Most of their sandwiches are on rolls.  Whats with the rolls?  Its a bit too much bread, IMO.  Perhaps you can get them with regular bread instead; not sure yet.  But the food quality was good and reasonably tasty.  Soup du jour was excellent, but mac and cheese a bit bland.  Users/CovertProfessor

20130512 20:04:23 nbsp Try the Urban Fries. They are hit or miss. My friend swears by them. I didnt think they were amazing. Your mileage may vary though.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130517 16:26:47 nbsp This place needs better workers who are not so obviously racist! I waited a long time to order my food before this rude white girl finally comes over. She ignores me and the other Asians in line and tries to take an order from the white family behind us. After I told her we were here first, her happy smile suddenly became a glare, and she took my order as it was the last thing she ever wanted to do. Once she was done, I waited a long time for someone to help me with sides, and the girl was sent to help me. She comes over and languidly gives me the cheese bread I wanted. Dont come here if you wanted to be treated like crap.  Users/AmyLi

20130520 07:48:46 nbsp My wife and I tried this place for lunch on Saturday.  The food was good, but overpriced.  I had an excellent reuben sandwich, and the fries were pretty good.  My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was also very good, and a side of sweet potato fries.  Two sandwiches with fries and one small drink came out to somewhere around $24.  Id expect to pay that in San Francisco, but its just too steep for Davis, which has a lot of other good food options for not much more than half the price.  The food was very good, though, and the service was perfectly decent. Users/TomGarberson

20130520 18:08:25 nbsp I came back today for dinner. I ordered the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich. It was mediocre at best. Soggy lukewarm chicken with only a splash of buffalo sauce. Definitely not worth the price I paid for it and the side of fries. I also tasted the Santa Fe salad. The dressing was plain, the chicken looked like it came from those foster farms ready to eat packs, and the tortilla chips tasted storebought. Maybe they were just having an off day.

20130520 19:15:23 nbsp Urban fries: pretty good, but Uncle Vitos has more/better creative fry options.
Mac and cheese: terrible. The sauce is so thin that it doesnt adhere to the noodles, and the sauce at the bottom of the bowl tastes like butter, not cheese. Users/MeggoWaffle

20130523 13:27:33 nbsp Food is okay.....music is entirely too loud...I like to visit with my friends when I go out to eat and you
cant hear yourself talk inside.  PLEASE JUST STOP PLAYING MUSIC! Users/gracevaughn

20130530 19:07:00 nbsp Tri tip was like leather. Food is over priced for what you get and the service was rude. Will not return!!! Users/scottpaulson

20130614 17:07:21 nbsp The food seems really plain, I agree with most of the comments here. Meat is especially rubbery. Users/ElissaPerez

20130627 10:41:54 nbsp I have been here twice and had the steak salad one time and the Sonoma steak sandwhich the other time.  Both meals the steak was cooked perfect. Not rubbery at all.  Maybe it depends on who is cooking it. I actually enjoyed both meals and didnt find it anymore expensive then other places such as Plutos. Users/LokiAbbi

20131015 21:24:54 nbsp I had to join the DavisWiki to comment on Jacks. I am not sure what all of the negative reviews are about, but I have had nothing but excellent food and service here. My wife and I have been there about five times now and consider it one of the best restaurants in Davis and a welcome alternative to Plutos. I personally think Plutos is way subpar in food quality and service to Jacks.

Anyway, I usually order either the bbq chicken sandwich or the sonoma steak sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries...delicious!! For two sandwiches and a (relatively large) order of sweet potato fries, it comes out to about $20 which I think is reasonable for the amount of calories you get out of this meal. If you were to compare how full you actually get buying a meal like this anywhere else, you will come out to about the same price. It is also very conveniently located for the growing population of us that live in west (and north) Davis. Even if Plutos tasted better, I still hate that drive down Russell and into Downtown.

Just give this place a chance. I hope it doesnt go the way of everywhere else in The Marketplace and shutdown in a year.

Oh and in response to some of the critiques from the other comments, I personally love the music choice there and dont think it is loud at all. I am usually pretty critical about the food up here having come from socal, but I genuinely think this place is spot on.  Users/BrandonSaller

20140122 10:11:48 nbsp Went there aftdr a few months off with my wife.  We both left feeling meh.  Food looked fine and the shift manager with the sleeve tattoos was really hustling, but the food just tasted bland.  Nothing special and certainly with a sammie, salad, fries and one soda not really how I desire to send 24 bucks.  Might give it one more try but it just doesnt feel like a good value.   On a plus side, the fries were cooked perfectly! Users/loneshark

20140314 11:26:43 nbsp Personally I think the prices are fine for the product. Went there again yesterday, and I have to say it is now my favorite salad spot! The half salad is huge, and, in my opinion, totally affordable for the quality ingredients. Im also a big fan of the Urban Fries! I really dig this place; so much so that it has become the new go to food spot when my boyfriend and I get too lazy to cook.  Users/RandiF
