20120210 09:01:05 nbsp I went ahead and bolded the location on that page to make it clear that its in California, not Australia.  I can sympathize with your situation, having information out there that people mistakenly take to be about you.  I still average at least one call a day on my cell phone for a plumbing service that owned the number before me, more than 3 years ago.  Its irritating as hell.  It can be hard to get these things straightened out. Users/TomGarberson

20120210 09:08:24 nbsp An editor had gone in there and added some clarifying text  you actually removed it in your first edit this morning (our time), which was kind of odd.  Im assuming you didnt mean to do that?  I dont think anybody is trying to stop clarity, its just that this is a website about Davis, California, and it says on the page that its a Jack Lin who practiced in Davis, California.  That really should be enough; Im not sure what else can be done.  I also dont think it will eliminate all confusion  never underestimate the profound abilities of the easily confused.  But I do agree that reasonable identification is a good idea.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
