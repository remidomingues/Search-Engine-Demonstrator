All massages begin with hot towel compression on the back to soothe and relax the muscle and release emotional tension. Jack begins massage with the shoulders, working to the low back (to flush and strengthen).  Next, its to the arms and hands, following up with the legs, elongating the iliotibial tract (IT Band) to assist with pressure on hips and knees.  Next, to the tibia (shin), and finishing the feet with another hot towel, to cleanse your organs using reflexology points, simultaneously flushing and balancing.


20121119 17:53:57 nbsp I highly recommend Jack as the best massage therapist I have ever had the pleasure to experience. I have enjoyed getting massages on a regular basis for more than 20 years so I have had lots of experience. I had a shoulder injury, ruptured disks and recent surgery to contend with and no one had been able to give me any relief so I was seriously considering repair surgeries when I first met Jack. Thank heavens he convinced me to wait, try a couple of sessions and see how my body responded.  Needless to say I was hooked and was a steady weekly customer for over a year. Alas he moved to Davis and he is very sorely missed in southern California. Users/SherriDemetre
