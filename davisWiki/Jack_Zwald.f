Jack Zwald was a Chinese, Communication and International Relations student at UC Davis (20072011). During his time at UC Davis, he served as the 20102011 ASUCD President.  He ran as a former  ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senator on the LEAD L.E.A.D. slate (with Previn Witana for ASUCD Vice President Vice President) in the Winter 2010 ASUCD Election.  In the Fall 2008 ASUCD election he ran for Senate, and won, with the LEAD slate.


 Winter 2010 Presidental Candidate Statement 

Fellow Aggies, we are Jack Zwald and Previn Witana and we are running for President and Vice President with the LEAD slate. We have both served on the ASUCD Senate and are approaching the recent 32% fee increase in a practical way to provide real solutions to the real issues. Jack Zwald is the current Political Director for the Davis College Democrats and Previn Witana is the current Philanthropy Chair for Delta Lambda Phi fraternity.
 Lowering Minimum Progress The recent and unprecedented 32% fee increase has hit students hard and many are looking at the prospect of having to withdraw to save money. Lowering minimum progress from 13 to 12 units would allow working students a chance to stay in school by creating a better opportunity to balance work and academics while keeping aid as a full time student. This reform would make it possible for many working members of underrepresented communities to more easily continue their education.
 Save the Memorial Union Games Area It has come to light that the bookstore renovation plan will include the removal of large sections of the MU games area. Many students use this area to unwind and it provides fun, safe, and inexpensive entertainment. If elected we will stop this land grab by the bookstore.
 Expanding Entertainment The best way to increase the amount and quality of Entertainment Council shows and movie screenings is to introduce another Assistant Director, bringing at least three major concerts or other events every quarter.
 Advocating Student Concerns to the Regents Although ASUCDs University Affairs unit has been representing the perspective of students in the Regents meetings, it has struggled to gain the same privileges that other UCs enjoy. We will fight to gain the ability to speak closely with the regents without forced membership in expensive and ineffective UC Student Association.
 Environmental Stewardship The current sprinkler system for the campus is wasteful and does not accommodate for the changing seasons in Davis. We pledge to find a more sustainable way to manage the waterusage of the campus based on weather and seasonal conditions.
 Tutoring Expansion With recent cuts to the Learning Skills Center and students forced to work longer to pay for college, academic achievement is at risk. The first method would be to create a partnership between the University and the private sector in the community by encouraging sponsorship from local businesses with an investment in UC Davis. Additionally, we would comb the university budget for waste and find reasonable solutions for reduction. The second method would be to create a volunteer tutoring program staffed by administrators and faculty. Not only would this program enable administrators to interact with students, but it would also give students a greater opportunity to work with worldclass faculty. These combined programs would allow for expanded hours of available tutors in challenging courses. Please vote Jack Zwald and Previn Witana for ASUCD President and Vice President #1 and LEAD for Senate #16 to bring about real solutions to the real issues.

 Fall 2008 Senate Candidate Statement and Activities 

Hi, Im Jack Zwald and Im a secondyear International Relations major and  UC Davis Chinese Program Chinese minor who hails from the Central Valley, and I am a proud member and candidate from the LEAD Leadership Empowerment Activism Determination slate.

Im currently the Vice Chairman of the Academic Affairs Commission Academic Affairs Commission and have collaborated with the university administration on a number of projects. As Vice Chairman, I stood against the waste of student money and helped craft the new General Education system by advising the GE task force on studentsâ€™ needs. He hopes that his efforts then and in the future will help students to navigate the sometimes complex general education system. He has also worked with L.E.A.D. over the last year to improve student life. Jack will be a strong and experienced voice on the Senate regarding these issues. Other ASUCD experience I have are as  a former intern for ASUCD Senator Andrew Peake and the former Voter Registration Coordinator for the ASUCD University Affairs Office ASUCD Office of University Affairs. As the Voter Registration Coordinator for ASUCD, I vigorously worked to increase student voice in politics.

Im an avowed Liberal and an active member of  the Davis College Democrats. During the last Davis City Council race, I actively supported student and renterfriendly candidates. As such, I support Barack Obama.


 Platform Issues 

  After Hours Safety Services


The administration has roadblocked any attempts to build more lights in favor of a night time aesthetic. I propose we undertake a survey of sufficiently lit corridors on campus, and produce and distribute maps with these safe routes highlighted for easy nighttime navigation.


  Movies on the Quad
The Entertainment Council has hosted student viewings in the past to great popularity, but never on a large scale with regular showings. I propose to work with the Entertainment Council to improve on their already exceptional program in order to bring films to campus and improve entertainment options, including live performances such as Rocky Horror Picture Show, for all students. I would like to eventually have films showing on the quad every Friday in spring quarter. This would provide a fun and safe outlet for UC Davis, and would be a great way to strengthen our student community.


  Reader Accessibility
UC Davis students are being gouged by text book prices and while the reserves system in the library has been successful, there is the often overlooked cost of readers made off campus. Additionally, this cost can never be recuperated since there is no buyback program for readers, as there is for text books. Students have no choice but to pay the Davis Copy shop, because there are no alternative sources for required readers. As an ASUCD Senator, I would work with professors, the book store, and Davis Copy shop to get at least one copy of each reader on reserve in the library to help alleviate the high prices of reading materials.
