Being a San Diegobased fast food restaurants restaurant chain, the Jack in the Crackfootnote(Its also been http://www.youtube.com/watch?vgYwgmAO_C4A called Junk in the Box.) (as it is affectionately called by some) of Davis is much like any other Jack in the Box restaurant, except sometimes much slower. It seems to be a popular hangout for Schools young kids and Homeless transients.  You can get a Hamburgers burger there. Of the major fast food chains Jack in the Box is one of the few to make their milk shakes from real ice cream. The other chain that does this is Carls Jr. Other chains use a premixed liquid. They also serve ice cream floats in Fanta Orange, root beer, and Coca Cola. Desserts include cheesecake, chocolate cake, and minichurros. Jack in the Box is quite possibly the only place to find Fanta Strawberry on tap at a soda fountain.

They also serve the best browns (hash browns) in the world, because not only are they hot and greasy like a construction worker in midday summer, but they also dont even taste like potatoes, which makes them all the more exciting to eat. Some people press them with paper napkins before eating because they are so greasy. They are, of course, still tasty this way too. Unfortunately, sometime in the recent past, they changed their browns to a smaller stick form; an order of them coming with 6 or so. The result is lessgreasy, IMO.

Despite the fact it doesnt serve the most healthy food, it is relatively safe food  Jack in the Box has the most extensive food safety program of any fast food company (see wiki:wikipedia:Fast Food Nation this book).

Breakfast is served any time of the day. They have a jumbo breakfast that features 8 minipancakes, syrup, scrambled eggs, sausage patty or bacon, and hash brown sticks for about $2.99. There is also a kids version with pancakes, hash browns, and a kids drink.

They have special seasonal milk shakes such as the Egg Nog Shake in addition to their regular line of shakes: Oreo, Vanilla, Chocolate, and strawberry.

They also have grilled cheese sandwiches, seasoned curly fries, and several varieties of salad. A healthier side option are the apple bites with caramel dipping sauce.

Because of its close location to the many bars on G Street and the fact that it stays open an hour after bar closing time, this place becomes a bit of a drunken madhouse at around 2 a.m. on popular drinking nights.

Sometimes this place closes the inside early (around 11 or 12) due to a lack of employees.  The drivethru is almost always left open however, and this leads many a drunken stumbler to tap on drivers windows in hopes of scoring some fries or chicken strips.

The restaurant didnt used to be called jack in the box, but jack in the Bjesus fish.  Doubt it?  Look closely at the picture at top right.  Alas, Jack in the Box has since changed their logo and eliminated the fish in favor of a retro style logo.

On 20090918, one Friday morning, most Jack in the Boxes in Northern California were not opened for business.  The State of California http://www.news10.net/news/story.aspx?storyid67138&catid2 claimed that franchise owner Abe Alizadeh owed them $4 million in unpaid taxes.

Those who want to use the drivethru should be warned, they absolutely refuse to accept more than one order per car. Apparently they were making too much money, and needed to find ways in which to reduce the number of customers they receive. They do this to make each transaction as quick as possible and get better scores on drive thru wait times.

Want to get your food for a little less?  Try this: Instead of ordering your normal burger, order a top bun, bottom bun, burger patty, cheese (whatever fixings you wish to have.  It normally saves about $.60.$75 per burger. In addition, if you dont think its quite enough food for you, you can order extra patties ($.60 for a regular, $.75 for a large sirloin patty, extra cheese $.15/slice) and just about anything else too. While its not really a doubledouble or anything and not truly a secret menu, it is an unknown trick you can use at Jack in the box and they will make it up to 4 patties of meat and 6 slices of cheese... Much like a competitor, anything larger and they get a bit grumpy.

If youre heading off to something at 3 or 4 in the morning (Stargazing and Space Sightings stargazing, or leaving on Adventures outside of Davis a long road trip), they can provide you something warm to eat to start off your journey.  Just order wisely if youre sensitive to grease.

 In the news 

On July 31, 2012, a man tried to drive a stolen dump truck through the drivethru.  It didnt go well for the drivethru. http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2012/07/31/mandrivesstolendumptruckthroughjackintheboxdrivethru/ Details here.

20051127 22:53:48 nbsp The service was very slow, and they did slightly botch my order (food was fine though), but they did NOT hassle the homeless guy sleeping in the dining room. That alone gives them a thumbs up in my book. Users/SteveDavison

20051208 17:28:12 nbsp Ive had a variety of experiences here; sometimes slow, sometimes quick, once skipped over entirely (but quickly and politely served once I asked.) It seems to be quicker in more recent times, as well. Users/BrianMcFadden

20060605 01:53:10 nbsp As far as use of space downtown this building is a waste. With only a finite amount of urban space in Davis I think this lot should be revitalized. Users/RobRoy
  Whenever I go by there between 1 and 3 am, the lot seems to be full.  Are you in favor of using eminent domain there?  Maybe I should call Freddie Oakley and ask if I can take my vote for you back. Users/BrentLaabs
    Im not talking about eminent domain. Im just saying it is ugly and if I were on the council when it was built it would have looked a lot different. Mixed use is the only way to go and drivethru doesnt make it mixed use. Im not against Jack in the Box. I like that they are open late  lord knows we need businesses that keep their doors open into the small hours, but Im just saying a one story building (with no historical significance) at that location is a shame. Users/RobRoy

20060605 22:42:34 nbsp Rob Roy is right on regarding this. It is the worst use of space in downtown.  Plus its ugly and the food is disgusting. The only good thing I can say about this company is their TV commercials are moderately funny  unlike every other fast food restaurant.  Users/JonFenske

20060606 00:17:29 nbsp Man, whats with the Jack in the Box hate?  You guys apparently havent had the Extreme Sausage Sandwich, or one of their milkshakes, or one of their sourdough sandwiches, or their curly fries, or their tacos.  Though I am pretty sure everyone who works here after midnight on the weekends is stoned/drunk.  Then again most of the customers at this time are too so it works out.  In conclusion, Jack in the Box is awesome. Users/ZacMorris

20060714 06:59:18 nbsp This Jack in the Crack is taking up space in downtown.  Surely, the city can do something more productive with the space it occupies. Users/KillerBobo
   Yours isnt the first comment that makes me wonder what it is about the building or business that inspires such calls for the use of Eminent Domain. The City of Davis does not own the land, someone else does. The city issued the building permit MANY years ago and had their chance at that time to impose constraints on the design of the building. I can remember how it looked during the era of the first clown; Id argue that there is value in how they have served the town over time (through periods of higher and lower quality service even).

20070514 15:43:14 nbsp Only thing ever worth getting at a Jack in the Box is their seasonal eggnog flavored shake (for those who like eggnog and eggnog flavored items).  Otherwise, everything at In N Out is better.  The fries at JB are more potatoetasting, but I still prefer In N Out. Users/CaitlinMorrow

20070902 01:48:44 nbsp I got a complimentary drink one time when they were a bit slow making an unusual order. I have never received a complimentary drink before from a fast food place before. I think the fact that they are open really late at night is helpful for nocturnal people needing something to eat.   Users/SteveOstrowski

 Users/SimplyIncognito
 Whats good about cold foods being hot? Anyway, I think this is some the best really cheap food in Davis.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080218 18:26:05 nbsp By far the best thing they have is the spicy chicken sandwich (SCS).  Although heres a tip: SCS costs $3.99 (clearly way too expensive for drunk food) so get a regular chicken sandwich for $1.99 and load it up with hot sauce!  If youre wasted, which you will be since youre eating at Jack in the Box, you wont notice the difference. Users/AlexPerkins

20080219 20:19:39 nbsp Drunk night owl? This is the place for you. Bacon cheddar potato wedges at 3 AM. 24 hour breakfast. Yes. Users/KateAusten

20080623 16:16:35 nbsp Both my friend and I got really bad food poisoning here last night at about 1am. He order the Jumbo Jack and I had the Ultimate Cheese burger and 2 tacos. Spent the rest of the night throwing up. I would seriously warn all those that plan on eating here in the future to do some research into the long history of ecoli poisoning deaths that Jack in the Box has kept on the DL. Users/TheDavisMarine

20080626 01:05:37 nbsp the drivethru is ridiculously slow.  its quicker to go in and order than to sit at the drivethru burning gas while waiting for the mom in front of you to receive her $35 order... Users/wesleywang

20090311 00:38:30 nbsp Awesome bang for your buck, and the service is generally good. Be ready for some long waits late in the night, but worth it if youre starving. Users/AlexChiang

20090409 02:07:08 nbsp I disagree. While far from real tacos, these things are delicious at any time of the day. Also, you can buy like 2 bags of tacos for like $8. Users/MattBlair

20090422 23:52:04 nbsp 2 tacos for $1 mmm. Users/PaulBrigs

  I ate there yesterday (Friday, 18th of September) so unless they closed it afterward, probably not. Users/hankim

20100123 03:32:48 nbsp often ive been refused teriyaki bowls late at night because theyve run out of rice. Right. Right? Users/AveLee

20100606 10:03:56 nbsp Horrible customer service!!! Not polite, and have no sense of courtesy. They purposely turned up the music to the point where I couldnt hear the people I was talking to. Completely disrespectful. I understand that it was 12am and there was some drunken people, but hey...you chose to work there. So deal with it and be POLITE!! Will never eat here again!  Users/Jackie89o

20100815 04:05:57 nbsp Yes, its true. If a bouncer from across the street (IE: me) sees a fight break out at the Box I will run over to stop it, along with a few of my bouncer friends.

We are a community people, and just because you are drunk (read stupid) gives you no excuse to trash the place or be an ass at a fast food joint (one of the only places even open that late btw) without repercussions. Just a warning for the rest of you. Users/WesP

20101026 23:43:10 nbsp gotta love jack in the box for late night food cravings, but on more than one occasion ive been told they were out of shakes or tacos (sometimes not even very late, once they were out of tacos at like 7:30). big disappointment, when im fixin for jack tacos, nothing else will do. Users/EugeneB

20110108 21:49:29 nbsp Went here today and ordered some cheese sticks and a chicken club sandwich... I got chicken strips and a double cheeseburger instead... lolwut.jpg Users/hankim

20110318 19:23:40 nbsp While still being Jack in the Box (read: fairly cheap, totally unhealthy and mostly overcooked/fried), it has improved quite a bit in recent months. The service has improved and the food has gotten better although not healthier, at least in the early evening hours. Users/WesP

20110621 23:47:40 nbsp Great place. Food may be crappy to some, but its a fast food joint. From 13, drunks and high people are the only customers. They take a while for the order, but if they feel that you have waited extra time or that they messed up an order, they will add free curly fries/tacos to your order Users/JohnathonJosephs

20110804 23:45:25 nbsp Jack In The Box, very close to my work, so it is ideal for a prework snack, or a postwork late night dinner.
The staff in the downtown location are always happy. The food, cheap and delicious. You can never go wrong with the 2 tacos for 99 cents!
Sodas are pretty cheap as well, and the milkshakes are delicious.

My coworker and I recently went to Jack In The Box before work, and unfortunately they ran out of the Oreo Milkshake. But a shift manager was there, and he gladly gave my coworker AND me FREE smoothies!

A great staff, clean dining area, and a surprise smoothie for me...I am sure you know where I will be eating before work for the next couple of months.. Users/NikhilDahal

20120305 20:02:03 nbsp If and when Jever is the closing manager, the store maintains its hours and its quality of service. However, when Esther is there, as kind as she can be at times, the establishment closes the dining room early, refuses to serve the drivethru the majority of the time, and if you are lucky enough to get an order in, it is terribly innacurate and completely lacking even fast food standards. Most recently, I attempted to visit at 10:45 pm on Sunday evening to find the doors had been locked already. It never maintains its hours due to pure laziness and nonprofessional behaviors and attitudes.

To make matters worse, when I left work at just after midnight I walked past and overheard her explaining thru the loudspeaker to a drivethru customer that they could only sell items available from the fryers, that they had shut down all the grills for the evening. Saw at least four vehicles in a ten minute time period drive up to hear the same story and quickly drive off.

Way to milk a company for a paycheck and cost them sales at the same time.  Users/WesP

20120305 22:08:33 nbsp Just to respond to WesPs comment, I am Esthers sister.  On her behalf, I would like to say sorry for the inconvenience, and the reason for closing early is they are shortstaffed (seems like an issue misdirected by pointing blame at her specifically by naming her on this page, as she is only a crewmember there not a manager).  When she has to close early, its not due to laziness or lack of professionalism.  She has  managerial approval to close early, or they would never be able to get their cleaning done on time.  Please dont blame someone whose shoes youve never walked in.   Users/CalamityJanie
