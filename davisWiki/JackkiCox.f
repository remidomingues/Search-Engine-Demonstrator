While Ill treasure it forever, Derek and I both want timeless wedding bands that will perfectly represent our marriage.  We admire Diamond Labs ethical stance on diamond production and being able to give these to each other on our wedding day will be the perfect way to start our lives together http://www.dnlrocks.com/derekandjackki.html
