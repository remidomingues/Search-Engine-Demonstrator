Welcome to the Wiki. Why are you deleting pages related to ASUCD and the California Aggie? If the pages contain inaccurate information, it would be great if you could update them with the correct information. We try not to delete pages for the publics sake.  Users/ElleWeber

20080121 12:21:42 nbsp From a historical perspective, Tiqula was an interesting figure. Quite seemingly... shall we say divisive?... But in the end his empire was defeated, albeit for a few years, so it is hard to bear too great of a grudge against him. And, now that his reign lays more than half a decade in the past, I would hate to see him suffer too badly from overly negative depictions of him laying on the top of the google search results for his name, considering that he was just a student during his heyday here. The wiki shouldnt have malicious attacks on it, so feel free to clean them up. Users/JoseBleckman

20080121 12:36:21 nbsp Please consider the Importance of using your RealName. Coming to the wiki and making partisan edits using a pseudonym rather than standing behind them with your real name is a little shady. Users/JasonAller

20080121 13:24:35 nbsp Welcome to the wiki, Tiqula.  While you can edit out details relating to you (and to your http://www.google.com/search?&qtiqula+bledsoe google search), it doesnt mean such things will stick around.  Were here to preserve information, even about the crazy careers of people from ASUCD.  Heck, look at John Reedy  he was even before your time.  What you can do is add stuff about what you are currently doing in an effort to leave, shall we say, youthful indiscretions behind. Users/BrentLaabs

20080121 21:33:14 nbsp FYI  I am not Tiqula. As I said I am a fan and an Aggie that attended school during the years these events occurred. I dont believe that he is concerning himself with the contents of the Davis Wiki but I believe that a Web site that lists mostly negative and inappropriate comments about a person is not helpful to the public.

Elle  I attempted to clear up the slanderous information but people continue to revert the page and remove my edits. I can certainly edit the page and keep the links to the other sites but improve the information as obviously someone who disliked Tiqula wrote most of the content.

I would ask that this Web site and the people reading it be fair and appropriate. I do not want to remove history from this site but I would like to see it be unbiased. Also, you ask why I use a pseudonym? Imagine being amidst a infinite loop of defamatory history that shows up on any GOOGLE search of your name.

20080122 16:44:47 nbsp Can you explain what in the final paragraph is incorrect?  Also, whats wrong with including the flyer on the page? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080122 16:49:07 nbsp What kind of question is that? Why SHOULD the flyer be posted? None of the information is substantiated. Also, the flyer is HATE propaganda. Is that what the Davis Wiki is about? Users/JacksTrade

20080122 17:23:56 nbsp Your http://daviswiki.org/Users/JacksTrade?actionuserinfo actions are speaking louder than your words with regard to your claim that you are not Tiqula Bledsoe. A little disclosure on your part would earn you some respect, and engaging in conversation rather than just making deletes would earn you even more. Users/JasonAller

20080122 17:33:38 nbsp I am not Tiqula. If I was, I would admit it. I am not here to gain anything but I think that sharing information that is hateful and has no evidence is unjust. I would not want information posted about me on Davis Wiki that showed up at the top of a google search that is inappropriate.

Why do you feel so strongly about keeping hateful information on this site?  Users/JacksTrade

20080122 17:38:29 nbsp Because its true.

If you google Tiqula Bledsoe California aggie you will see archived hits to these past scandals. Some of them require you to register to see the whole article, but I can see enough to verify the claims on the page.

Why do you feel so strongly about rewriting history and obscuring the truth? Users/MaxMikalonis

20080122 17:47:06 nbsp You do not have any incredible evidence that validates the claims Davis Wiki posts infer. I understand that there were scandals, controversy, etc. There is no reason to post and become obsessed with hateful and slanderous information. The information regarding the controversies and links to the Cal Aggie articles were left in there. We do not need to continue to perpetuate the cycle of HATE by posting hateful posters, etc. Users/JacksTrade

20080122 17:49:54 nbsp Interesting tip posted on the Wiki stating: TIP: Remember: We dont all share the same perspective! Lets keep the wiki useful for all members of the Davis community.

I believe this applies here. The information is useful and people can continue to research and make their own conclusions without HATE integrated into the equation. Users/JacksTrade

20080122 17:56:54 nbsp I personally restored the poster earlier today because it is an interesting piece of Davis history.  Thats it.  Ive never been attached in any way to UC Davis, I have no idea who this Bledsoe person is, but thats a neat example of a political flier.  It echoes the mid to late 1800s United States political fliers.  It would be a shame if you removed it from the historical record. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (615) 5176900

20080122 18:06:08 nbsp You may have noticed that there isnt just one person reverting the content you are removing. Given that situation dont you think that it might be wise to engage the wiki community in discussion? Those who have in the past have left happier than those who didnt. Go to the top of Tiqula Bledsoe and click the {{{Talk}}} button and create a talk page. You might find allies for many of the edits you want to make by approaching the situation that way rather than just trying to overwhelm the wiki through repeated edits. Users/JasonAller
