20090706 14:11:14 nbsp Our 40+ year old home seems to need constant attention, and we just don’t have the time or patience to keep up with all the things that need repair or updating. Matthew Jackson has been a reliable handyman for many of our home repairs, from large projects to small.  He reparied our back fence several years ago and did a quality job.  The fence has weathered some heavy storms and is still strong and sturdy.  He has painted a number of interior rooms, and we appreciate his attention to detail to ensure a top notch job, especially since we tend to be perfectionists.  We’ve called on him for small jobs as well, like reanchoring the garage door assembly after it had become  knocked loose, changing plumbing fixtures and electrical switches, fixing warped doors and broken latches.  He’s very conscientious and gets the job done in a professional manner.  We are happy to recommend him to others who are looking for good work at a reasonable price.
