Jackson Lytle The JMan Jordan Is a Davis resident/student/musician/party maniac. Jackson was a member of several prominent local bands including Sterling Riot, Mortal Forever, The Descolada Virus, and currently Conducting From The Grave. Jackson is wellknown throughout Davis for his simple, easygoing nature, positive outlook, and general niceness.

Early Life


Jackson was born Jackson Lytle Jordan on March 31, 1990 in Santa Cruz, California. The hospital no longer exists, and neither does the Elementary School he attended as a child. Jackson lived on the West side of town, 2 blocks from the beach. Jackson lived in a log cabin for the first 10 years of his life, before moving to Davis when he was 10. Jackson was homeschooled by wolves and speaks elvish.



The Davis Years


Jackson attended DaVinci High School and graduated in 2008. He has been attending Sacramento City College since, and moved to Sacramento in early 2010. He has since relocated back to Davis. Before he graduated, he was the bassist for Sterling Riot with Rob Roy. Jackson had the distinction of playing in the greatest metal band to ever emerge from Davis, Mortal Forever with Anthony Nelson, Tommy Stone, and Alex DeMarini. The group played Davis and Sacramento before disbanding on 2/7/2009. After Mortal Forever, Jackson and Anthony joined The Descolada Virus , where the band has gone on to tour Southern California and, soon, Northern Mexico. More recently, Jackson joined the Sacramento band Conducting From The Grave, and toured the American states all the way to the East Coast, and Canada. Jackson works for the City of Davis. Jackson moved out to Sacramento again in 2011, only to return again within a few weeks. Many speculate this is because Jackson is incapable of surviving outside of Davis, but time will tell.


Personality and Outlook


Jackson is quite possibly the nicest Davis resident you will ever run into, and is a very helpful person in general. Jackson had a somewhat Agnostic view on religion, but is now a confirmed Athiest, and is still very accepting to all aspects and lifestyles. He is sometimes the butt end of jokes from his friends and bandmates. While this can be funny, Jackson will not put up with it for very long. During a trip back from San Francisco, Jackson became enraged over the volume of conversation taking part in his car, and threatened to throw everyone out to walk home. From that moment on, Jackson was not trifled with as often.
