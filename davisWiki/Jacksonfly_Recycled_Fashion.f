Jacksonfly Recycled Fashion was a thrift stores vintage/thrift clothing store located downtown next to Ace Hardware.  As they put it, Were new... were hidden... we have a lot of inventory... we are priced low... we are rad... or so we think... come and see for yourself!  It is now The Rad Vintager.

They sold new British bras, new & used designer denim, vintage tops, kids clothes, funky tshirts,dresses, and $5 Hawaiian shirts.





20101103 21:47:02 nbsp I visited this store for the first time last weekend and found it very pleasant. I like the idea of a higher quality used clothing store with some new things for sale in down town Davis. The woman behind the counter (the owner?) was friendly but not overly chatty or pushy which I appreciate when Im shopping for any clothes. I think this the kind of store that you have to check back on periodically because they get new things in often. Users/MaryCarroll

20101114 21:23:01 nbsp I really like this place. I found a fantastic selection of likenew used clothing for extremely reasonable prices. The man behind the counter was extremely nice and very helpful. They also trade and buy clothing! He mentioned that he would be more open to trade right now, which is understandable, since the store opened recently. But it might be nice to get a few bucks for the nicer things I would otherwise give away. I am definitely coming back for the great selection, value, and service.  Users/LizzyT

20110131 10:38:53 nbsp This weekend I stopped in Jacksonfly to take advantage of Davis 30$ on 1/30 day. I was pleased to find out that the entire store was 50% off, rather than just 30% off. This translated into a brand new pair of Lucky Brand jeans which were marked at $25 only costing me $12.50. I found lots of other cute things too, and even at full price they would have been a steal. There are lots of unique and vintage items as well as more popular brands like Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, Levi, Forever 21, etc.. The woman working there was very helpful in finding things my size, but was far from pushy like the previous poster said. The only thing to keep in mind when shopping here is to bring cash/checks, as they dont take debit/visa cards. Since I had to run up the street to get cash from my bank, the woman working at the store let me pick something out for free for my trouble. Worth it!! I will definitely be stopping in here frequently to check out their inventory. You should too!! Users/LaraStilling

20110131 15:32:26 nbsp This place is great! I went there on Sunday and everything was 50% off. The prices are really low and the selection is great. They dont have an overwhelmingly large amount of clothing in the store and everything there is cute. The woman working, Amanda, was really nice! She helped me find clothes in my size and gave me her opinion on the stuff I tried on (when I asked, of course). Users/RachelKerwin

20110208 09:29:09 nbsp This place is just what Davis needs. They have great customer service, even though they only take cash. However, I didnt mind because I found a silk Oscar De La Renta top for only $6!!!! Yay. Users/MelannieLavarias

20110208 09:53:12 nbsp was wondering: do they have larger sizes? Im about a 12 or sometimes 14 Users/jsbmeb

20110504 12:12:18 nbsp Just wanted to echo what is being said on their facebook the store in its previous location, by Peets Coffee and Tea, has closed, and the store has moved to the new location listed above. They should be open by this weekend (5/7 or 8ish/2011), supposedly. Users/AndrewJacobs
