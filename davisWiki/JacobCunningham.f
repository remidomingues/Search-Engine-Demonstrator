I am 19. I live in the state New York of the United States of America.

My dream is to pioneer commercialized space travel.

I created a user profile here because I was searching for a website that does photo requests. Since I have a habit of starting things and not finishing them, I figured I would instead ask someone else to take a photorequest or find one in leu of creating my own.

I have read somewhere that in order to take a photo of the stars you need a camera with a very long exposure time. Since I lack this instrument I cannot take the photo that I wish to have.

Often I find myself looking upwards at the sky. Wondering why I am still here.

So today when walking my dogs, I realized that it had just rained, there was still fog at street level and when I looked up at the sky, I saw mostly grey, however in one area I saw a break among the clouds and there I found blackness with stars that peppered the sky. This is the photo that I wish to have taken. A black sky covered mostly by clouds but a high resolution quality that shows stars.

Im currently a Physics and Engineering student, at least that is what I am enrolled in. I no longer care for being normal so I will pour out who I am on this page. I love technology, my mind thinks abstract not only in reasoning of my existance but the way I see things, make things. One of my hobbies is creating model airplanes, I have since been designing for autonomous usage perfecting my designs. Nobody seems to like it, a few but not the mass that I had hoped for before. I dont know why I wished for other people to like my things, perhaps it is that whole being normal thing again.

Tonight at 1:05 AM, I have finished watching the movie Mr. Nobody, I am quite moved by this film. It is abstract and I must say it is immediately one of my favorites.

Its funny that your dream tells you what you want to be, what you should be, yet while you work on your dream, you cant help but fail along the way. I guess sometimes it is not the right time yet.

All of my work is under GreenAce92, this is the universal username that I have used for whatever accounts I may have, computer programming, model aircraft, fashion etc... random things I have taken interest of and perhaps dropped. Most active forums currently are FPVLab, RCGroups and very rarely Wattflyer. I have some blogs here and there. Other things I have started, FoamFlightRC, Normalbus and other things I cant quite remember at the moment.

I may most likely forget this page since I came here with the intention of asking for a photo. However then I stumbled onto this feature and my mind sort of just went off on a tangent. School starts soon. The torment of fitting in will once again bother me. Perhaps I will be better prepared this time.
