20121031 14:32:47 nbsp Jacobsaw your note on ACE Hardware...any chance you could scan and post the letter? Id love to see it Users/PeteB

20121031 15:19:15 nbsp Yes, I would like to see the letter also.  You might also consider sending the letter to local media, such as The Vanguard or The Davis Enterprise.  (For what its worth, Ive shopped at ACE many times and have always been happy... but the thought that they wrote such a letter does not make me happy). Users/CovertProfessor

20121105 09:57:11 nbsp It does not really surprise me that she did this. While I was working there she never hid her political party affiliation. She even went so far as to offer to pay for our movie ticket if we saw  2016: Obamas America. I do feel that handing out a letter to your employees telling them who to vote for is definitely over the line. Users/JamesKrause

20121105 11:03:01 nbsp I would love to scan and upload the letter but I am not sure exactly how to upload the scan to Davis Wiki, any Ideas? Users/JacobPeterson2

20121105 11:17:19 nbsp You can upload a PDF.  Hit Edit on the page you want to upload the file to, click on the Upload Files button at the bottom, select the file from your computer, and upload it. Users/TomGarberson


    Thx for uploading it. Yes and its not completely what I thought. I thought it was TELLING you who to vote forits not. Its propaganda only with supporting material.  Not so sure this is so bad.  Users/PeteB
     Asking employees to vote for Romney & Ryan.  That seems bad to me.  A request from a boss is a little different than a request from someone else.  Im going to put the letter up on the ACE page.   Users/CovertProfessor
       Maybe my words were poorly chosen. I dont like it at all but its a request not a demand. Users/PeteB
        Which, if you look at what JP2s original comment, was what he said in the first place.  cp
