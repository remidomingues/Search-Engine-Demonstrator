Jacob Gene LaRue was one of the people who worked to have the University Farm (now known as UC Davis) sited at Davis.  He was a farmer in the area who farmed near fellow proponent George W. Pierce.  Both were UC Berkeley UC graduates, with Pierce having Republican connections and LaRues father being Hugh LaRue, a Democrat who had been a 49er, served as Assembly speaker, state agricultural society president, Sacramento sheriff and exofficio UC regent and finally a farmer. He also owned the house across from the governors mansion in Sacramento.

LaRue and Pierce lobbied hard around California, meeting with the governor, UC president and the commission to select a site. One of the ways that he is honored is that La Rue Road is named for him.
