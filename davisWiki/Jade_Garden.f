Address(Jade Garden, 38.552726, 121.713815) is a Restaurants restaurant in the Fifth Street Plaza shopping centers shopping center. It is considered by some to be in the upper echelon of Davis Chinese restaurants. The flavors are distinctive and rich while the menu remains large and creative. Its not the typical cornstarchladen, MSGrich, Davis Chinese Food Chinese food (some reviewers have said the opposite, although it has been noted that you can request that they use less MSG in your dishes).  Their dishes often have more sauce than comparable dishes at other placessomething that some folks like and some dislike.  An order of rice can help with the situation.  Diners have also reported some variation in food quality from day to day, with dishes occasionally being undercooked.

Reports of service varysome patrons enjoy excellent service, while others are forgotten for substantial lengths of time, particularly if the place is busy.  Users/JimStewart reports that it can be a good place for lowcost business lunches.  The restaurant is usually quiet enough for relaxed conversation, the food and service is consistently good, the price is cheap and there are large roundtables available.  Id call ahead if your group is larger than 4.

The prices are comparable to Hunan or Silver Dragon and a little cheaper than Ding How.

20110807 09:57:44 nbsp This place really isnt worth the money. Not only is everything ridiculously salty and greasy and also expensive, the service is absolutely awful! We had to wait an EXTREMELY long time for our food to arrive and they kept forgetting our food and leaving our orders (or not cooking them at all) in the kitchen or not bringing us the things we asked for. This is understandable (though not really excusable) when it is busy but it was NOT busy when we were in there! There was only one other person there! I know theres a stereotype that college students dont tip well, but dont make it a selffulfilling prophecy! / stars. Users/nutmeg

 working in the industry, I can tell you that forgetting an order is never understandable, especially a food order, ( forgetting a drink order, ehh, many drinks can be made under a minute). And the stereotype of college students dont tip well  I never think that because half of Davis for 9 months of the year are college students.. I do not work at Jade Garden FYI. ND

20120508 19:27:26 nbsp As of 5/2012 the menu is quite a lot changed and MUCH larger than whats posted above. Prices were from 6/7$ for vegetarian dishes to 10ish for fish and shrimp. Food was great! Odd take on the fish balls, good though with fresh interesting veggies. No customers, not a great location, nice people so patronize this business.  Users/JaneBF

20131124 20:39:32 nbsp Over a year, the menu is even bigger! But be careful, food is often sweet and fried rice very oily. Many meals have ingredients not on the menu, like pork! I am not stoked to have pork, large amounts of it, in my fish.  Users/JaneBF

20140418 21:34:24 nbsp I work nearby, but only go in about once a month.  Ive never had anything bad, and a few times have been surprised at how fresh and good things were.  But mostly Id give the food a 6.5/10 (about what youd expect for the price).  But, theyre just nice, downtoearth people, and I feel good giving them my money.  Feed me. Dont rip me off. Dont poison me. Treat me like a friend.  Check, check, check and check.  Ill keep going back. Users/AlexRogerson
