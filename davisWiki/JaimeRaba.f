 About J.V.Raba 

I received my J.D. from UC Davis School of Law.  I am presently an http://sacprobate.com attorney, but sometimes work as a legislative historian, computer programmer, musician and teacher.  Attended UC Riverside, a school in a notsoexotic location, but has some very good programs I did my Bachelors Degree there with majors in Philosophy, History, and Religious Studies.  Also attended University of Notre Dame, where I completed a Masters degree with a concentration in History of Christianity.

  No longer has two BBQs sitting on the east side of the Turtle House but Users/RobRoy may borrow them whenever he needs them (also fixed the messed up screws in the legs).
  Good seeing you at UC Day, now I know what you look like! Users/JimSchwab

20080107 06:03:53 nbsp Hello there, Mr. Raba.  Just curious:  Do you still do any work as a legislative historian? Users/CurlyGirl26

20080111 14:19:29 nbsp :) Heres a smile waiting for you  until the next time you get bored and look yourself up on DavisWiki Users/DevaChan

20080116 17:18:58 nbsp Nice.  I was aware of your practice, but what got you interested in legislative history?
And btw, totally agree with your comment about Symposium.  I like the place and Ive eaten there numerous times, but I swear I was thinking the same thing about their pizzas as compared to their traditional Greek fare. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080121 16:19:02 nbsp I was there on Thursday, but spent most of the time in the West Hall Users/TarZxf

20080219 20:14:12 nbsp Great!  Nice to know that several of us UCD folks are representing! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080225 01:30:46 nbsp Re UC Day.  If I see you, I sure will!  Always nice to meet fellow Davis people (not to mention Davis Wikians).   Users/CurlyGirl26
