Jaki Joanino is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2012 ASUCD Election running on the SMART slate.


 Candidate Statement 

Hi fellow Aggies!! I’m Jaki Joanino, a 3rd year Dramatic Art and Political Science double major. I’m running on the SMART Slate, (Students Matter: Activism, Retention, and Teamwork) which seeks to give a voice in ASUCD to all underrpresented communities on campus. I am currently an intern for ASUCD Senator Jared CrisologoSmith, secretary of student run multicultural theatre company Unity Clap Theatre, and a fellow of the Davis Humanities Institute.

REFORMING THE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT
As a participant in 1/3 of the past years Civility Project, (Un)Civil (Dis)obedience, I have heard the statement again and again that tolerance is not enough to settle the instances of hate that occur on our campus. We all know someone who has been affected by these hurtful events, whether it be the vandalism of the LGBTRC or the carving of a swastika on a dorm room door. Our campus should be a safe, welcoming, and positive environment where we should try to understand each other. I will ADVOCATE for requiring ETHNIC, GENDER, AND RELIGIOUS STUDIES as a part of the university’s SocioCultural Diversity requirement.

MORE AND BETTER REHEARSAL SPACES
As an artist and performer, I can whole heartedly say that the performance groups on our campus are the bright face of UC Davis. Although majors in the Arts are not common on our campus, UC Davis students are a group of wellrounded, talented students that need a place to express, rehearse, and share our work! Why should groups that sell out Freeborn hall in events like DDR, or HellaCappella, rehearse in apartment gyms or parking garages? I will PROPOSE for MORE PRACTICE ROOMS for student and performing groups and a DANCE STUDIO in the MU expansion project. I will also work to buy FOLDING MIRROR UNITS to be reserved for groups in the ARC pavilion.

PRIORITY RESERVATIONS FOR STUDENT GROUPS AT CAMPUS VENUES
Student events are a large part of our campus life, but sometimes the very venues on our campus give us few options to choose from. Most of the time, its because outside groups claim the dates for events that may not involve UC Davis students at all. I will work to create AGGIE RESERVATION WEEK, 1 week in the month of June where students groups get 1st priority to reserve the dates they want for their own events in the next school year, starting in the following Fall Quarter.

Together, the SMART Slate will work towards the following:

MORE TEXTBOOK RESERVES
We will work to save students money by creating a textbook reserve located in the new Student Community Center, supplementing the Shields Library Reserves and giving students much needed additional study space and free access to the most common GE books.

FUNDING FOR ETHNIC/LAV GRADS
Community specific graduations celebrate the achievement in higher education of students from underrepresented and marginalized communities. By granting funds to these events we seek to actively create a safe and inclusive campus environment which celebrates the diversity of our student body.

WE can do it! Vote for me #1 for ASUCD Senate, SMART #26, and Bree Rombi and Amy Martin for Exec! Thank you for your support. :
