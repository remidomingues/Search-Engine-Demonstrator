Jamba Juice has fruit smoothies, fresh squeezed juice, and more. They range from 250330 kCal (for the same size), with 330 kCal/$3.50 being the best value. Their slogan is Blend in the good. It was changed from that felt good.


A juice smoothie is excellent after a summer hot day bicycling across town. Or for a nice cool relaxing drink while studying for classes.

In 2009 they added pizza to their menu. Only they dont call it pizza, they call it California Flatbreads (perhaps pizza sounded fattening, or they wanted to distinguish themselves from the many pizza outlets). They offer three types, ranging from $3.50$3.75. In 2010 they reformed their original Flatbreads to a larger 6 inch size, as well as improving the overall taste and quality of the product.

They also have oatmeal, sandwiches, wraps, and salads. In addition, they also have baked goods such as muffins, bread, pretzels, and bagels.

Sometimes they give out Free Food free samples to people who may be sitting around The Marketplace.


The downtown Jamba Juice (store #76), formerly located at Address(500 1st Street) #3 in Davis Commons, closed its doors on November 13, 2013 after Whole Foods Market http://www.davisenterprise.com/business/jambajuicegetsthesqueeze/ outbid Jamba for the lease.

 How to Order at Jamba 
For the greatest efficiency, follow this quick guide on ordering.

 1. Say the size of the smoothie first
 1. Pick which flavor you want to drink (Note, Strawberry is not a smoothie option and will only irritate the cashier. Read the menu.)
 1. Modify it if you want
 1. Say whether or not you would like a boost with it (note: boosts are added nutritional supplementation, like extra fiber or calcium.  The different types of boosts are listed near the cash register. Boosts cost a little extra.)
 1. Repeat steps 14 for each of your smoothies (PLEASE dont make the poor cashier ask you, Which size?, and Which boost would you like that? for each of your Original Chocolate Moods with Energy) :P
 1. Smile and pay )

 How to Modify Your Smoothie: 

Any smoothie at Jamba can be modified by the following commonly used methods:

 1. You can ask for it Thick or Thin
    Thick means it have slightly less juice and more fruit.
    Thin means it will be thinner and more liquidy.
 1. Adding an extra dose of any ingredient for a nominal 50 cents. (This also increases the size slightly)
 1. Swapping out one ingredient (as listed on the menu) for another. A juice can be subbed for a juice or solid, as can a solid.

Its easy!

At Jamba Juice, the person who is pouring the smoothie cant take your order. You would be surprised how many people try to order at the pour station.  All orders should be directed to the individual at the cash register.

 Secret Menu and Items of Interest 

They also have a large secret menu! Unlike other places (read: InNOut), it actually has remained a secret.    Jamba has an entire secret menu of unhealthy smoothies named after things that would involve copyright violations were they to be included on the menu. The ones we know of:White Gummi Bear, Red Gummi Bear, Green Gummi Bear, Raspberry Dreamin, Pineapple Dreamin, Sourpatch Kid, Tropical Tango, Pacific Passion, Berry Depressing, Now and Later, Peanut Butter and Jelly, Apple Pie, Fruity Pebbles, Rainbow Sherbet, Strawberry Shortcake, Push Pop, Skittles, Andres Surprise, and Lemonade Lightnin.

Most of these smoothies are probably available in Davis.  Some of them are created from items not listed in the above ingredients.  Ordering a Pink Star or a White Gummi or Strawberry Shortcake in North Davis or South Davis Jamba doesnt make the cashier bat an eye  its all on the register.  These secret drinks differ from the normally listed Jamba menu in ingredients used, the lack of the general fruity flavor, and even texture/consistency (depending which was ordered).

However, there are many names and recipes for the Secret Menu items that were created by the customer, but DO NOT exist in any Jamba Juice recipe guide (see the list above). If you ask for a Now and Later there is no recipe for it in the system, and you could be receiving a different smoothie every time. Most of these items are underground and word of mouth from long ago and it is hard to find remaining employees who know these. It is recommended that if you want to order one of the items listed above that isnt either a White Gummi, Pink Star, or Strawberry Shortcake know the recipe yourself, or else you may not get the smoothie. There are many combinations you can make, just make sure you know what you are getting, asking an employee for a Sex on the Beach can be offensive if they arent aware of what youre asking for.

 Dairy 

There is some confusion as to which Jamba Juice products contain dairy. According to their http://www.jambajuice.com/what/faq.html FAQ:

Does Jamba Juice offer dairyfree products?
Why yes we do! All of our fresh juices, juice blends, and boosts are dairyfree. Any smoothie can be made moooofree by substituting the dairy with soymilk or sorbet. Current dairyfree smoothies include: Protein Berry Pizzazz™ and Jamba PowerBoost®. Jamba’s Apple Cinnamon Pretzel is also dairyfree. Our products are not certified as dairyfree.

Does Jamba Juice offer vegan products?
You betchya! Our fresh juices and juice blends, EXCEPT the Vibrant C Blend, are vegan. Jamba also offers two vegan smoothies: Protein Berry Pizzazz and Jamba PowerBoost. The Apple Cinnamon Pretzel is our only vegan baked good. Our products are not certified vegan.

However, the http://www.jambajuice.com/menuguide/allfruitfaq.html All Fruit FAQ implies that nonAll Fruit brand smoothies contain dairy.

For the lactose intolerant and vegan the Jamba All Fruit smoothies are a great option because unlike the other Jamba smoothies they do not contain frozen dairy.

If avoiding dairy is important to you for health or philosophical reasons, it might be a good idea to call their customer service (18005459972) for clarification.

Tips
  Try a smoothie with no ice, its better that way. Users/MichaelGiardina
  Although its not on the menu, they will gladly substitute nondairy sorbet for sherbet.
  If youre going to order 2 Sixteens of the same smoothie with a friend, do yourself a favor and save ~2 dollars by getting a Power size and asking them to split in two cups (its same volume, albeit a slightly different recipe and you only get 1/2 a boost)
  For that matter, if youre really trying to save, grab an Original instead and split it. Although the Original size is advertised as 24 oz, the typical cup is actually full of about 26 oz of smoothie. Do the math.
  The Peenya Kowlada, both Moods, and the Orange Dream Machine each have 4 scoops of non fat frozen yogurt/sherbet in them. Just an FYI if youre actually trying to buy yourself a somewhat healthy meal (the rest of the menu is fine).
  Remember these are supposed to be meal replacements.  Dont go to Dos and order a huge order of Nachos and have a smoothie to drink.  Its not that healthy.  As a meal replacement, its fine.  Even the aforementioned Orange Dream Machine is only 540 calories...pretty light meal if you ask me


20050613 18:54:09 nbsp I dont like them! I used to work for them (in Folsom) as a smoothiewench and the management structure really blew the big one. SBS
  I used to work for them too (in downtown Oakland) and they really screwed me over.  My manager entered into the computer system that I was a bad influence and subversive when all I did was tell his manager that he pawned all his work off on me.  Then I couldnt get a job there anymore (not a big deal) but then when another place called them for references he told them not to hire me.  The bastard. Users/BenWebber
   That is really bitchy, Ben! Im not sure my manager went as far as entering into the computer that I sucked, but boy did she not like me. SBS
    So, I did a little research and as far as I know, its an upstanding place. But I have not found any articles that arent anything but puff pieces, so I will keep looking just to get some perspective. My opinion is leaning toward, though, the fact that Ben and I could have just had bad managers. SBS

20050613 23:39:22 nbsp Too sugary and artificial. A smoothie should be fruit, not fruit sorbet. Users/JackHaskel

20051208 14:06:35 nbsp I had a good experience ordering at Marketplace JJ. The Cashier person was friendly, helpful, and cheered me up for the rest of the day. YMMV. Users/SteveDavison

20060930 20:41:07 nbsp The Jamba Juice near the Berkeley campus uses a type of paper cup instead of the normal styrofoam. I assume that the city requested or coerced that into happening. Is it possible that the ones in Davis could be required to do the same? Users/RyanPrendiville

20061013 19:28:18 nbsp Thankfully, it actually isnt Styrofoam, but some weird biodegradable plastic stuff...so less worries at least :)  Users/NatalieKitchiner

20070311 18:14:10 nbsp Jamba Juice uses Styrofoam (aka Polystyrene), they say it in their FAQ. Berkeley banned it, thats why they dont have them there. From what Ive read it seems that paper cup biodegrade better, but polystyrene recycles with a lesser impact than paper cups if you have a program for it. Users/AlexKistner

20061108 21:07:32 nbsp very sugary. but once in a blue moon ill have their strawberry dreamin with soy  Users/AnnThiNguyen

20070615 12:40:37 nbsp Two Jamba Juices that are not on the menu are:  Pink Starburst, White Gummy Bear.  They both taste really weird though...a lot more sweet tasting.  Users/rivas
  do they actually taste similar/near enough to their namesakes?  Users/KevinChin
  The Pink Starburst does.  I was able to get one at a Sac Jamba Juice.  Its like drinking a giant sugar bomb.  Users/LeightonHinkley

20070720 22:45:23 nbsp Ive been having fun with the secret menu items.  Pink Star and White Gummi Bear are both in the system  they just hit a button on the register.  I ordered a Red Gummi Bear today  it wasnt in the system, looks like you need a cashier who knows what it is.  She punched in the White version, then modified it:  took out the peaches and mangoes, added in strawberries and raspberry juice. Took her about half a second to do it, Im tempted to just ask what all the flavors in the system are.   Users/EdWins

20080928 16:13:52 nbsp i ordered a pomegranate paradise today and asked for no strawberries.  i watched the person make my drink, add a scoopful of strawberries, realize his mistake, look around to make sure no one was watching, and serve it right up to me. not a huge deal for me because it was a taste preference thing, but if you have food allergies, i would watch out. Users/CandiceWang

20081203 20:07:29 nbsp As much I love drinking Jamba back in high school, I dont drink it anymore now as an undergraduate. WHY? I totally agree with JackHaskel, the bulk of jamba juice is mostly sorbet (fattening plus artificial fruit flavors) & sugar water (too sugary).  This is just a friendly reminder to all... its ok to enjoy it sparingly but way too much excess sugar in 1 drink.  Other than that, Jamba usually has good customer service & the one in DavisCommon is bright & tidy like most Jamba Jucie chain stores.   Users/AlyceeLeung

20101014 08:42:11 nbsp i LOVE the white gummi, and the red gummi. anything on the secret menu is good.

except this one time an employee acted like a total snob and asked me what is suppose to go in the white gummi. and i was like, well idk, thats YOUR job, not mine. and he told me that for my own good, i should know what goes in a drink or else etc etc etc...i was so hot and tired that day i did NOT have time for his crap. sometimes little things can piss you off at the wrong moment, and that was definitely one of them Users/emme

20101209 11:30:34 nbsp Just an FYI to customers who want a Secret Menu item, there are only 3 options that have set recipes. The White Gummi,  the Pink Star and the Strawberry Shortcake. Every other option, such as the Red Gummi or the Green Gummi you need to know the recipe for. After working there I heard 8 different recipes for the Red Gummi. After asking a customer if they would like the typical Red Gummi recipe, they corrected me and said Thats not correct. Being corrected on something that doesnt exist is extremely idiotic. Anyone can walk into an In & Out and ask for a Big Mac. You may get a hamburger, but since they have no recipe for it, youll never know what your getting.

If you want to try the secret menu smoothies, find the recipes online and bring them in, and ask for those ingredients exactly. If you as them for a Sour Patch Kids, youre asking for too much. Arent there 4 different flavored Sour Patch Kids candies anyways? Same with Skittles, You asking for the Purple Bag? The Red or Blue Bag? Know the recipe yourself and you will get the same smoothie every time. If you are allergic to an ingredient and you get it in the Red Gummi it isnt the fault of the smoothie maker, It is your fault that you didnt know what was inside of it when ordering it.  Users/JeffDurand

20130606 10:52:48 nbsp im planning to open my own business out of the US and its the same concept as jamba juice, is there someone who have worked there before or just knows what machines they use to make smoothies, juices, etc. All the basic information I should know.. thanks! Users/joseelias

20131231 15:39:22 nbsp Im wondering if anyone really knows why the commons location closed. It says on the wiki that the corporate headquarters elected not to renew the lease but what we were told was that Whole Foods outbid them because WF wanted a bigger space, in which they could offer smoothies. I care because I want to know if WF is predatory, similar to Walmart, in driving out competition.  Users/JaneBF

  I heard the same from a few Jamba Juice employees.  I frequented the commons store fairly often before they closed and got to know a few of the former employees pretty well.  Ran into a couple of them after they closed, and they told me Whole Foods had approached the landlord with a higher offer on the lease.  Sounds like the landlord asked Jamba Juice if they were willing to pay an equivalent rent and Jamba Juice declined. JT

   I have heard the same thing, from a couple former employees, and I think it was in Wendy Weitzels column Comings and Goings in the Enterprise. Im not 100% sure on that though. JamesKrause

20140124 21:39:16 nbsp Bummer. Im going over to the WF wikipage and point people to this discussion. Im not a conspiracist, but the WF CEO is antiunion, says FACA is fascism? We embrace this? Users/JaneBF

20140125 06:35:12 nbsp while it might not be overly neighborly, I wouldnt consider Jamba a mom and pop store. I thought it was well known that WF was coming into Davis into a small sq foot location and that they desired to expand as leases turned over.  Seems like the the market operating as intended.   Users/loneshark

20140415 23:08:49 nbsp There is another smoothie off of the secret menu called Screaming Orgasm. No joke, I used to work here and I was asked to make it several times.
