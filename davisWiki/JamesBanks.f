Here is a poem of his, in both Spanish and English:

{{{
Mascotas

Tenia una cuy, pero nunca un perro
Perros saltan en su pierna, ladran y
Se van y
Faltan atencion

A cuyes les gustan comida y dormir
Y la mia me parece feliz con su jaula,
Con su detencion

Ella asentia, y sobre todo,
Yo asentia

Un amor que podia contener


Pets

I used to have a guinea pig, Ive never had a dog
Dogs jump up and bark and
Run away and
Want attention

Guinea pigs like food and sleep
And mine seemed fine with her
Cages detention

She agreed with it, and above all
I agreed with it,

A love I could contain
