UC Davis Class of 2010
Welcome to the Wiki!  For better or for worse, one thing youll find on the wiki is that subjectivity is an inherent part of it.  Davis Wiki doesnt try to be contentneutral the way Wikipedia and sites of that ilk do.  Plus, if you ask around, youll probably find that a very large chunk of people on the internet dislike any sound on web pages.  Im often listening to music when I browse from home, and if another tune pops up over top of what Im listening to, annoying is a pretty accurate descriptor. Users/TomGarberson

20110120 16:54:34 nbsp If you dont want that warning to be on that page, ask the owner to get rid of the sound. It is annoying and were going to call a spade a spade here. If you disagree, fine. Youre still wrong, though. Id hate for anyone else to go to that website and be blasted with music they didnt ask for.

If youre going to be talking to the owner, the webpage could use some reworking, too. I see a gigantic blob of flash and I have no reason to activate it. People on many mobile devices will see nothing.
