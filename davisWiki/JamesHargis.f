20090513 20:38:56 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Renaming a page works much better than a copy and paste job because it retains the history trail of the edits and moves over the photos as well. Users/JasonAller

20090513 20:58:48 nbsp When your friendly neighborhood stoners start calling their drug of choice cannabis, then, its appropriate to rewrite the page and rename it. As it is, youre just trying to make the wiki reflect a convention that is not widely accepted among the community of medical and recreational users. And just using a Spanish name for the drug is racist? What kind of nonsense is that? Put down the weed and start thinking about these things a bit more carefully. Users/WilliamLewis

20090513 21:08:57 nbsp Who are you to say what the proper name for something is? Look at the convention we currently use on here. We talk about Almond Trees, Cherry Blossoms, Evergreen Pear Evergreen Pears, and Olive Trees. While the scientific and/or proper name for these plants has a place on the page, we use what normal people call these species. Its pointless to cause confusion by refusing to use a perfectly good colloquial name that is widely understood by nearly everyone and insisting on replacing nearly every reference with a more unfamiliar term.

20090513 21:34:03 nbsp Before you throw around terms like troll or vandal, you might want to consider that Ive been heavily invested in this community since mid 2005. I suppose I could be an extremely persistent troll/vandal, but dont you think Id be banned by now if I were?

Why do you care so much that we replace an extremely common name with a less common one? I mean... Im not big into marijuana culture, but I know a lot of people who are. Generally, the term cannabis is favored when youre talking about different strands (indica, sativa, ruderalis) or when youre talking about international drug control. In most other cases in the US, marijuana is the more common term. Thus, we should generally use it and we dont need to replace it. Users/WilliamLewis

20090513 21:40:23 nbsp Redirecting a colloquial name to the scientific name is mostly a Wikipedia convention. Their goal is to be authoritative. Our goal is a bit different. Were a reflection of Davis. Look at the history of the page. People here tend to prefer the term marijuana over cannabis so that should be the name of the page. Of course, youre free to use the term cannabis in the page all you want. People use the terminology. What I object to is the mass replacement of one term with another, especially when the replaced term is more common. Ideally, the page should use both because people in Davis use both.
