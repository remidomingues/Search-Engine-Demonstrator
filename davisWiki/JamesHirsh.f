20071017 07:40:46 nbsp Howdy James.  I was wondering if I could contact you outside the wiki somehow.  Im trying to put together a history of Campus Cinema as far back as I can take it.  If you could Mailto(jw DOT dw AT timewarp DOT org, email me), I would very much appreciate it (my phone number and other contact info is also on my user entry).  Thanks! Users/JabberWokky
