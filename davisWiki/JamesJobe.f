THINKING OF THE GIRL WITH BIG EARS


When the wind is strong you can hear the ocean
in her ears, and theres just a chance
shell get airborne. At least theres always
hope.

And when she brushes her long hair
behind those tremendous lobes
it never comes back out again. Ever.
In fact, she lost her old glasses
that way.

Washing her ears requires a man
and a boy and a good thirty minutes. Ladders
and brushes are involved, and a permission slip
for the boy. His mother signed it
just before her breakdown.

Ears like this are a plea for attention, just ask
any circus elephant or Lyndon Johnsons ghost.
Sure, he signed the Civil Rights Act,
but he also knew the woes of having ears
that can provide shade for the village. Like Lyndon,
the big eared girl is a Democrat, but
her ears vote Independent.

Once I met the girls huge ears in a truckstop
near Dallas. I was hitchhiking to Maine,
but those massive ears were going West, seeking
new lands, new dreams. Some years later,
I would follow.

KINDNESS


Six days till Solstice, and in the news there is nothing about kindness;
The war machinery grinds away, lives in the balance teeter and shake,
And far away the soft river sand shifts under the weight of my hooves.

Ghandi walked forever and a day for salt; well, salt, yes, but something
Else, a lesson about kindness that danced over the heads of most,
The dryhaired masses only gathered to call out, More! More!

My cat killed many mice, its true, but some she let go, ignored, just
Watched while they escaped like the flatulence of the terrified. She could
Easily have slain them all; perhaps she was just exercising some kindness.

My fatherinlaw is 103. At dinner, his hand shaking, he will reach across
The table with trembling chopsticks to pass someone a tidbit, tasty,
Something he knows is wonderful and gives away out of kindness.

Who are you now, James? Where are the dreams of so many years ago?
At Solstice the world changes; Summer, and the Sun grows weaker, more so
Everyday, and slowly the air cools in the wake of the Suns kindness.
