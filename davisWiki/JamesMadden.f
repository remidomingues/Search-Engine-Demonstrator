20100516 23:25:19 nbsp Hello and welcome to the Wiki! Also, thank you for risking your personal safety to help spread information.  Users/hankim

20100517 00:36:26 nbsp looks like her Users/StevenDaubert

20100517 00:36:39 nbsp What became of the concrete throwing? Users/StevenDaubert

20100517 08:04:00 nbsp She was a really bad shot!  :) Users/JamesMadden

20100517 09:54:36 nbsp Applaud the picture! Her hair looks a little different (I saw her with some reddish brown dye) but the face is the slightly plump one I remembered. How about sending to the police? Shes scamming everyone  passersby, parents with kids.. :(  Users/LeeY

20100518 04:14:52 nbsp Hey James, let me know where in the parking lot and about what time she threw the concrete at you.  There is a slight chance that might be caught on security camara.  I work at that Safeway, and shes a little psycho (that pic by the way is DEFINITELY her!). Ive shood her away and called the cops about a half dozen times at least!  I hadnt seen her for a few months but it looks like shes back.  Anyway, Im glad you didnt buy her story and that you didnt get hit by that chunk of concrete! Users/TonyAhr

20100519 00:50:22 nbsp Mind posting the full resolution picture of the crying girl? Users/WilliamLewis

20100519 19:14:11 nbsp you should still shoot John Neves an email describing what happened, Im sure he would be interested Users/StevenDaubert

20100523 17:31:41 nbsp Wow, interesting update Users/StevenDaubert

20100524 23:56:44 nbsp First the picture and now the license plate. Youre like a superhero without a cape... or maybe you do wear one? Users/hankim

20100525 00:09:21 nbsp DPD should already have that plate, but you might as well give it to them as well

talk to officer neves if you see him, or send him an email he has already had contact with her and said it would be arresting time if he found out she was still engaging in this kind of activity  Users/StevenDaubert

20100525 00:23:58 nbsp I think he would be more interested to hear about your repeated contact with her, especially the incidents where she / friends have pursued you / moved beyond aggressive panhandling Users/StevenDaubert

20100525 10:09:17 nbsp as silly as it seems to you, it will be no laughing matter to him Users/StevenDaubert

20100531 12:35:58 nbsp Hey, out of curiosity, how did they credit the photo?  Im glad they used it; the wiki is open so it can be used by everybody.  The article isnt on the website (yet).  If you add the exact title, it would help people trying to look it up. Users/JabberWokky

20100531 15:03:15 nbsp u there? CBS13 wants to talk with you now Users/KemblePope

20100531 15:07:20 nbsp email me if you want to be interviewed on the tv... hes here in davis now; ive never actually seen her before so im no help... kemblepope at gmail dot com Users/KemblePope

20100601 10:23:40 nbsp Hey, how sure are you that that is her picture? Users/JabberWokky

20100601 10:25:55 nbsp That totally looks like a unit in Almondwood. Users/hankim

20100601 12:12:11 nbsp When I talked with the police, they said your assault was never officially reported. You might want to call them up. Users/WilliamLewis

20100601 12:14:19 nbsp hmmmm, thats interesting! I will have to talk to them. Users/JamesMadden

20100601 18:59:48 nbsp Mention what you just posted on the page, officer neves has had contact with her before. He response to emails as well! Users/StevenDaubert

20100601 20:51:44 nbsp This was all logged when an officer responded to the Kinkos incident, on the 21st.  I noted the rock throwing at the time as well as entering my vehicle and grabbing at my camera.  The officer felt there was not enough evidence to arrest her on assault however.  I was not hurt and none of my property was damaged.  He said, if hed caught her it would have been her word against mine, and I was the one taking a picture of what may have well been a random girl in a parking lot.  The officer sympathized, knew her game, but said there was little he could do.

I wish theyd just do a sting.  Dont get me wrong, I appreciate them trying to keep it by the book, but shes making them look bad in the process.  They need to stop waiting for people to call her in, and go out and catch her themselves.  Still, I guess reporting all our encounters give them all the more ammo to hit her with when shes caught.

I also want to say, the wiki is AWESOME.  Ive loved watching all the cooperative detective work.  If the Davis PD have their hands tied at the moment, at least we can work together and keep our city on alert. Users/JamesMadden

20100601 20:53:28 nbsp I should also add that there may be some confusion with the name JamesMadden.  Its not real. Users/JamesMadden

20100601 21:02:20 nbsp Neat stuff.  To be honest, now that her names out there, shes hopefully a bit screwed.  Googlebombing her to that page and the various news articles about her would probably really do it, although theres several people with that name out there.  Hows it feel to have your photo all over the news btw?  Kind of neat!  Anyway, this is all likely going to have a much longerterm impact than her being fined by the police.  Users/EdWins

20100601 22:36:37 nbsp I agree.  Shes going to have a tougher time running her game now and will hopefully have a harder time finding a job/apartment/etc in the future.  Sounds like people she knows are calling her out on it now as well.  Arrested or not, her karmas coming around on her, and thats a pretty good feeling for me.

Yeah, seeing the picture up on the news was pretty cool.  Edward said it the best though, watching this thing grow into what it is now was pretty amazing.  Daviswiki really is awesome.  Id read the Con Artist page when it was still Crying Girl and never thought Id run into her.  Figured she was a transient who would soon move on.  I never imagined the magnitude of it though until people started responding to the pic.  Tony and Kemble were awesome and put a lot of work into it too.  Kembles writeup was great.  That myspace page popping up on there this morning was hilarious.  And then whoever got the media involved blew the gates out on the whole thing.  Definitely nice work on that end.

I have to say though, I think it was all the people whod added their stories that made all this stuff possible.  The sheer number of people responding was amazing.  Daviswiki is the best website ever. Users/JamesMadden
