Im not even in Davis anymore, what the hell am I doing here?

I was the first person to throw a frisbee off the outside balcony of the Mondavi Center, having done so about a week before it was opened to the public. I was also the first person to catch a frisbee on that same balcony when the guy buying tickets decided to throw it back at me.
