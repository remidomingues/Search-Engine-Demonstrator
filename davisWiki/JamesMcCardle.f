20110501 13:58:56 nbsp Hey James!  Traditionally, wikis are not neutral.  Ideally they reflect the community they represent, and in practice, they tend to do a fairly good job of representing the spectrum of folks who edit them, with underrepresented views sought after.  You might be confusing wikis with Wikipedia, which is an entirely different type of site that simply uses wiki software for a different kind of project (writing an encyclopedia), and Wikia, which is a sub project of Wikipedia that uses their same rules.  Its an common mistake: although wikis predate Wikipedia by many years, the Wikipedia project, with its odd rules, is much more commonly known.  If you think that Geek Squad offers great service, that would be a reason to remove the comment (as the bad idea comment wouldnt reflect your point of view), but just removing commentary in the name of neutrality is generally fixed by undoing the change (as commentary and viewpoints are encouraged here).
