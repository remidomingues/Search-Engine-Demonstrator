20070909 16:10:13 nbsp I wonder, if Steve was banned from every page he is connected to, would he find a page totally unrelated to him to soothe his revertfinger? Users/KarlMogel

20070910 19:30:39 nbsp ASUCD has been a department for years and years.  Its just that he got added that way in some organization chart, and now everyones calling him director.  His business cards still say business manager.  And heres the most important part:  we shouldnt have a Director of student government, anyway. Directors direct, but shouldnt the students direct?  Its a bad title for him, and we should fight it at every opportunity.  The name change was at random, and its a subtle encroachment on student authority. Users/BrentLaabs

20070910 21:57:43 nbsp Maybe Comcast is just popular  but Users/DavisGreens IP address could always be from dialup. See if it changes from day to day and that might suggest who it is. Dialup services typically come with cable packages. Users/KarlMogel

20070911 13:46:03 nbsp Hello JamesSchwab, Certainly feel free to upload the Bowers Addition map. Since it is copied from a government document circa 1913, I assume it is public domain. I assume you can do that by taking a screen shot and uploading that? (It would be nice to have enough resolution to read the number1 through 20assigned each lot in each of the five blocks. In addition, feel free to upload most anything else you find on the Old North Davis History site. John Users/JohnLofland

20070911 22:02:57 nbsp hey james, ive been wanting to thank you for a while. i really appreciate the support you showed on the UCD May 1, 2007: Day of Action May 1st page. I believe you were the only one from the wiki hierarchy that was vocal in backing me up and it meant a great deal to me. also, it was a pleasure having you in two of my classes. take it easy.

20070926 12:35:38 nbsp Yup.  Im approaching it with hands open, no assumptions.  I connected the names as well, but Im letting the editor reply rather than guess.  Right now there are only about ten edits, not difficult to audit, so Im happy to take it slow. Users/JabberWokky

20070926 13:37:07 nbsp you should tell the better business bureau how university village treats residents. it is the only way to get them to make changes or get whatever compensation you deserve for the things they do.

20071009 10:33:10 nbsp Davids public page is his private page, as he deleted the public one this morning and linked it to his private page. Users/JabberWokky

20071015 18:48:08 nbsp Its perfectly legal to post pictures taken in public, children or otherwise.  Every photo of a rock concert would have to be scoured for a kid on his dads shoulders otherwise.  :)  Seriously, though... the http://www.krages.com/phoright.htm details are a bit complicated, but the general rule of thumb is that anything taken in public is always perfectly fine, even on private property that is a public area (stores, walkways, fronts of houses), but things that have a reasonable expectation of privacy (through a window, over a shoulder, in a back room of a store) are not allowed.  If you use your photos to sell something (publishing them doesnt count), the rules change, but for wiki usage, if it is in the public eye, you can take a photo of it and place it here.  You can of course be asked to leave private property, but you do not have to ask permission before taking photos if the subject you are shooting is reasonably visible from an area open to the public.  If youre interested at all, the keywords to search for are photographers rights. Users/JabberWokky

20071022 23:07:52 nbsp Funny that you mention that, Joe and I were having a conversation about the recycled ASUCD platforms (i.e. Expanded Wireless Access).  I didnt know the calendar was one of them. Users/GregWebb

20071030 21:53:01 nbsp Thanks for your comment on the Recovering From Spiritual Abuse page.  I agreeSA is tough to define, but once youve experienced it, your radar picks it up very quickly.  Not like something Jesus would do at all!   Users/RichLindvall

20071114 18:12:46 nbsp Hi James. The leg I was referring to was the giant one that a bunch of preslate Friends people, Adam Barr, and various other people back in early 2005. It was in response to the Student Focus controversy when their candidates got caught in the dorms in 2004. It gave better definitions of how far away people had to be from polling places in order to campaign, what constituted as campaigning, etc. I know the bill passed, and the elections codes were modified as a result. I dont have a copy of it off hand, but I am pretty sure the elections codes were properly modified to reflect that old bill. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20071114 18:25:26 nbsp I wish I could tell you, but I dont remember if we mentioned anything about volunteers or not. We might have assumed that volunteers would be sanctioned by SJA, and thus did not mention them in the elections codes, since the election committee doesnt have jurisdiction over noncandidates. But, I would have to reread the elections codes to see if we said anything at the time about volunteers. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20071118 16:12:50 nbsp Haha, thanks for the endorsement.  Users/EliYani

20071122 19:13:25 nbsp What was the message on the bounce? I got your reply just fine... Users/ArlenAbraham

20071122 20:37:35 nbsp Nobody made one.  Im on the road, in Washington DC for the holiday and am borrowing a friends computer, so I lack my usual graphics tools, otherwise I would have. Users/JabberWokky

20071123 21:06:16 nbsp Hi James,

Please do not revise my personal Davis wiki page. Thanks. Users/EricFriedman

20071123 21:12:42 nbsp It is my page. It has my personal info on it. What the fuck is your problem? Chill man. The elections are over. Users/EricFriedman

20071123 21:24:11 nbsp Do not change my page anymore. Im not going to get into a pissing contest with you over the wiki again. In not concerned about the wiki norm. This is my personal information that is released. Do not revert my page again. Thank you.  Users/EricFriedman

20071123 21:32:37 nbsp James, this has nothing to do with politics. This is about a website that has my name on it, and that can be searched by anyone on the web. We can take down my page if you wont stop this bullshit, but its going to be posted in a way that is acceptable to me since it contains my personal information. Users/EricFriedman

20071124 16:27:25 nbsp I deleted it. But, how do I know it wont appear again? Why do you insist on revising my page? Users/EricFriedman

20071126 10:38:56 nbsp Once again, you missed the point. Users/EricFriedman

20071202 21:01:47 nbsp so, you delete your friends page per his request, yet you vehemently oppose deleting my page at my request. Whats the difference? Why did your friend want his page deleted? What a hypocrite.
 Users/EricFriedman

20071202 21:10:44 nbsp Why delete it?  I talk paged both edits.  Is it an issue with the misconduct story?  Otherwise, hes still part of the history of Davis (and his own website is still up, too, which is what tipped it for me). Users/JabberWokky

20071202 21:27:22 nbsp It might be a good idea to tell everybody that in the Talk entry.  Its not up to just me.  I figured it was something like that, which is why I restored his entry, but not his story (which, a la people removing their own restaurant reviews, seems to be pretty accepted... you might want to note it in the Talk entry there, too, lest that one get reverted as well). Users/JabberWokky

20071207 16:18:14 nbsp Regarding Users/BrentLaabs Brent, the issue is not his personal opinion about GO or anything else for that matter. My concern with him up until very recently was the fact that he was regarded as a senior member of the Davis Wiki community, and therefore I had higher expectations for his conduct throughout this past season. It doesnt matter what he does inside of ASUCD, when he comes to the Davis Wiki wiki, he needs to set a good example and follow the norms. But since he has decided to express himself here on the Davis Wiki wiki as a strongly antiGO person, he will be treated as such, which also means that his opinion shall be considered as equally credible as that of Eric Friedman, or any other person. James, you are the first person to directly defend Users/BrentLaabs Brents actions on Davis Wiki wiki, which is a good thing in my eyes, but Users/BrentLaabs Brents unwillingness to defend his own credibility throughout this whole process only serves to support my decision to treat Users/BrentLaabs Brents expressed opinion as equal to Eric Friedmans. To maintain credibility on the Davis Wiki wiki, Users/BrentLaabs Brent could have used his vast knowledge of ASUCD to play the role that Users/JabberWokky JabberWokky played throughout (clarifying differing viewpoints, checking for facts/corroboration, etc.), but instead he became his own front line assault team. He tried to wear multiple hats simultaneously, and that almost never works when it comes to political discussions. Going forward, Users/BrentLaabs Brents point of view should be regarded as nothing more than 1 part of the APOV, instead of a large part of the APOV or the entire APOV. That is the only fair way out of this big mess at this point. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat
