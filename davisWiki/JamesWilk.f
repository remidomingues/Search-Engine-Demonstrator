><James has red hair and chicken legs.  He is surprisingly good at Softball softball despite these features.  He plays for Heaven Help Us and likes to eat ice cream at Baskin Robbins after the games.

><He worked at BJs Restaurant and Brewery BJs (until very recently) and thinks their pizza is awesome. He is too lazy to make his own page, which is why he gave Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle full authorization to make this page for him.
