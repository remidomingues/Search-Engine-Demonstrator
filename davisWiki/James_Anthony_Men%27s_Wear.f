20100124 12:01:11 nbsp This is where I got my white tux from, the Gojks are awesome folks Users/StevenDaubert

20110805 09:35:25 nbsp This is where I got my tuxes for all High School Proms... theyd measure you for free, even if you werent buying there.  They had lots of Joe Boxer and Tommy Bahama stuff in the later years... the owner was always kind and generous (hed do the measurements himself!) Great local business, was around for a pretty long time (87, as stated above). Users/OldDavis73

20120612 00:35:08 nbsp So sad this place is gone. I got my tuxes for Junior and Senior prom here. Im going to a wedding later this month and I cant seem to find anywhere else other than Mens Wearhouse to rent a tux. The people here were so friendly, and they had a pretty big catalog of suits/tuxes to rent from. Users/CecilioPadilla
  I believe you can rent tuxes at Robbens Department Store in Dixon Users/DonShor
   there is a dry cleaner in the Coop complex that does Rentals? Daubert
   Awesome! Ive been googling tux rentals, but Executive Cleaners never showed up. Alas, I went on here to complain about this place closing, never actually looking on the wiki to find another place. Users/CecilioPadilla
