20060516 09:30:47 nbsp I recently moved to Davis from Wisconsin, and chose Dr. Meinert to be my dentist.  Ive always dreaded going to the dentist, and still do, but Dr. Meinert and his hygenists were all friendly and gentle.  No cavities either!  Im definitely happy with my choice and would recommend other people go here as well.  GSHIP covered the entire cost of the visit.  I was a little surprised since Dr. Meinert wasnt listed on here as one of the GSHIP dentists.   Users/AdamSchneider

20060818 13:05:43 nbsp I say AOK to Dr. Meinerts office!  I had bad experiences with dentists in the past and as a result have become kind of freaked about going to the dentist. I used to go to Dr. Storms office in Davis.  But I never had my teeth cleaned by the same hygenist twice in 3 years and that kind of bugged me.  To make matters worse my husband was misdiagnosed by Dr. Storm. He changed dentists to Dr. Meinert.  I did more investigating and read lots of horror stories about Dr. Storm on the wiki. SO... i braved my fear of new dentists and changed to Meinert.  Sharon, my hygenist, was great. Everyone in the office is very friendly. Dr. Meinert seemed great too (although I cant comment on serious work because I had no cavities and needed no other procedures). Anyway, if you are looking for a dentist I would recommend Meinert.

20070220 17:12:07 nbsp Superb, I got an excellent cleaning and they seemed very professional.  Would definitely recommend them Users/AaronBurda

20070609 10:36:26 nbsp Had a great experience at Dr. Meinerts office.  Quick, painless cleaning and great view of downtown during the process!   Users/Alaga


20071221 16:04:35 nbsp DR. MEINERT IS COMING BACK!!!!!!  I just went in for my 6 mo checkup, and was informed that Dr. Lin will be leaving, and Dr. Meinert returning in January.   Users/Alaga

20080208 18:23:52 nbsp Not Recommended. In my experience, the staff who work in this office are extremely rude, unhelpful, and have a poor understanding of administrative issues relating to the university and dental insurance companies. Because of the errors of the staff in this office, my insurance claim was not filed correctly. They did nothing to help me when I asked them about it and in the end they threatened me with collections and thus forced me to pay the full sum that should have been paid by my insurance. When I filed the claim myself (somehow I figured out how to file it, having never done it before, and the women in the office could not) it went through without any issues. Delta Dental paid Dr. Meinerts office and so did I. The office did not inform me of this. When I called the office and asked for a reimbursement, it took them months to send it to me...and they did not refund it all. They still owe me $60. Frankly, I dont expect to see my money. Users/AraGlennJohanson

20080317 16:28:39 nbsp I got some fillings here a while back. It went quite well :) So well in fact, that Im going to call his office right now and get a checkup! Users/brandonhkey

20080509 11:08:39 nbsp I am soooo glad that Dr. Meinert is back!! It is so nice to see familiar faces in the office. The staff is very welcoming and inviting. I used to be scared to go to the dentist, but Dr. Meinert makes me feel so comfortable and relaxed. He is such a nice family guy! YAY FOR DR. MEINERT! Welcome back. You were truly missed.  Users/bombbrunette

20080811 15:40:40 nbsp Dr. Meinerts office is excellent. My hygienist was very gentle and patient (compared to other dental hygienists Ive had) but I still felt like I got a very thorough clean. Even though I just went in for a routine clean handled by one of their dental hygienists, Dr. Meinert took the time to talk to me about my teeth. Good service, and definitely one of the best dentist experiences Ive had! Users/VinceBuffalo


20090319 12:08:13 nbsp Went this morning to have my teeth cleaned and I liked the staff and the office experience. The hygienist was sweet and took her time while scraping along. Need to go back in for a few cavities but thats my fault! Users/condemned2bfree

20090402 19:05:39 nbspI had a horrible experience at muy first visit to Dr. Meinerts office today. I say office because I barely got to see the Dr.

The hygienist started out with me ok, pleasant and chatty. But when I had a problem with the ultrasonic cleaning procedure nearly drowning me, ehe said she was sorry, I told her it was ok and she switched to the pick and scrape method (much better). So far so good. When she left saying shed call the dentist in I was a bit confused as shed only completed half my mouth. Dr. Meinert came in, a very nice guy, poked around, discussed some fillings and then that was it. Wha??? The other half of my mouth was still not cleaned!!!

To me it seemed that the hygienist took offense of me not liking the ultrasonic treatments.

Long story short, they used my, once every six month, cleaning allowed by my insurance (for free) and only cleaned half my mounth!!! If I want the other half cleaned itll cost me $65.00!!
When my wife called back to ask about this weird experience the hygenist said my teeth were in really poor shape, When my wife said I had them cleaned 6mos ago, the hygenist said she didnt know the quality of the last dentist I had!! (he was very good).

I have never encountered this issue before. Ever. This, to me, is mostly about generating income for the Dentists office and ripping off the patient.

I would NOT reccomend going to this office for the staff. Dr Meinert seems nice enough, but he should exert more oversight of his office operations and procedures. Users/zippity

20090820 10:42:08 nbsp I had a good experience at Dr. Meinerts office. The hygienists were super friendly and helpful. Dr. Meinert took a quick look at my teeth and double checked to make sure my teeth were okay. I havent been to the dentist for five years due to fear of the dentist and cavity fillings. Surprisingly I did not have any cavities and only need to get my wisdom teeth pulled out. My hygeinist was extremely patient in cleaning my teeth and gave many tips for brushing. I had a great experience here. I have not had any work done by Dr. Meinert so I cannot give any recommendations or comments upon his work, but the experience in this office was overall pleasant. Im not so afraid of the dentist anymore, in fact I look forward to my next visit. Users/FlowerCindy

20090827 11:45:10 nbsp The dentist was gentle and provided a good experience, and in general the staff over the phone were friendly and competent. The only odd thing about the staff was the abrupt change in attitude with any feedback or requests for changes. It seemed unprofessional so even though the dentist was fine, Im unlikely to return.      Users/acgradstu

20091015 11:46:35 nbsp I would definitely recommend Dr. Meinert. I cant say Ive had any major work donejust routine cleanings and exams, but Ive always had a good experience. The hygienist is always very thorough and gentle; cleanings are painfree. My teeth are pretty happy now! Dr. Meinert and the staff are friendly and have always been very professional in my experience.  Users/blee

20100201 12:23:01 nbsp DO NOT GO HERE. The staff is very rude and unhelpful. The nurse kept checking herself out in the mirror when she was setting up the XRay machine. The whole time (about 5 minutes) Dr.Meinert was in the office with me, his priority was flirting with the nurse. He did not explain anything to me, even when I asked questions. It seems like he is one of those dentists who has seen it all and has stopped taking his patients seriously and with compassion. He does not realize that what is to him a daily occurrence can be in fact a miserable and unusual experience for a patient. After all this the only thing I left the office with was a sheet of paper that said how much I would have to pay for everything they want done. I still have no idea what are the pros and cons, the side effects, the alternative options, etc. I feel like I am just a number to them, not a person. Hopefully not all Davis dentists are this rude.

20100208 10:21:10 nbsp If you work for the state, the only Delta Dental plan he is on is the Premier plan.   Users/aharjala

20100209 15:27:47 nbsp I have never posted anything on wiki before but had to create an account just for this.  I had a HORRIBLE experience here.  I went for a cleaning and they told me I had to go see an endodontist for a root canal.  I was referred to a local endodontist, had to see them twice, then had to come back to Dr. Meinert another two times before the procedure was finished.  Apparently endodontists do not finish the procedure (installing the crown) so I had to go back to Dr. Meinert twice once to get a temp crown and then again for the final crown.  No one bothered to tell me this before they referred me.  If I knew this I would have just gone to a dentist who could do it all in a total of two visits, which is very typical.  The lady behind the front desk was INCREDIBLY rude.  Also, when I was getting my temporary crown fitted, the assistant dropped the temp crown on the ground wiped it off and put it back in my mouth.  That is COMPLETELY unacceptable.  When I told the lady at the front desk about my complaint her only response was a blank stare and a rude so what do you want me to do about it??? TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!  Users/flipnflygurl

 As a dentist I must say the experience this person describes is very typical for a root canal.  If the root canal was on a molar it is a very involved procedure and often takes two visits to get the best results.  A crown also requires two visits because the tooth has to be prepared for the crown and then an impression of the tooth is sent to a lab where the custom crown is made so it can be cemented later.  I would disagree that it is typical for this whole process to take place in just two visits (unless it was on a single rooted bicuspid, which is certainly possible to complete a root canal and crown prep in one LONG visit and then a shorter visit to cement the crown).  It may sound scary to just have the temporary crown wiped off but it was probably wiped off with a cavicide wipe.  Cavicide is a very common dental disinfectant, and it comes in presoaked wipes (much like a baby wipe).  It is a very effective disinfectant and would certainly kill any bacteria or viruses that may have contaminated the crown when it fell on the floor.  It would have been best if this office had let the person know what to expect ahead of time but the expericances described here sound like good dentistry was taking place.  users/dagonjones

20100322 13:48:59 nbsp I just called to make an appt, the lady on the phone was very nice and professional even though I had to call her back because I didnt have all the necessary information. Needless to say, I am looking forward to my appt on Thursday. Users/Tiffee
  Looking forward to a dentist appointment?  Now thats just weird.

20100331 23:22:17 nbsp I have mixed feelings about this dentist. I started going to him because my dentist left town and hes close to UCD. I wish I had read these reviews before going. I saw the hygienist more than Dr. Meinert. When I did see him, he was more focused on talking to his hygienist about the Super Bowl than dealing with my teeth. I found that rude and unprofessional. Finally, the straw that broke the camels back was an interaction with a receptionist. During my last visit Dr. Meinert said he would reduce the price of my copayment for some fills because they are tiny. I watched the interaction between Dr. Meinert and his receptionist where he instructed her to change the price because my fills are tiny. I asked her what my total copayment would be and she gave me one price. I set up an appointment for these fills in two weeks. When the receptionist called me she gave me a different price. I told her that is not correct and I reminded her of what Dr. Meinert said. She called me back and said I asked Dr. Meinert and we dont do that.... I could not believe that three people in that office could not remember an interaction 2 weeks before. Bottom line, Im going elsewhere.   Users/LC

20100402 13:44:24 nbsp Today I saw Dr. Arina Huang and her diagnosis was different. Dr. Meinert was ready to give me three fills and charge my insurance and myself at least $400. Dr. Huang gave me a thorough inspection. She even checked my jaw. I realized that I really did spend a lot of time with the hygienists at Dr. Meinerts office. Although they were very nice and friendly, I did not feel like they had the expertise to diagnose dental conditions. Dr. Meinert mainly works on fills and work often identified by the hygienist. His office feels a lot more like a business.  Users/LC

20100406 13:16:59 nbsp I echo the thoughts of the last two posts. The doctor is nice and the hygienists do a good job, but the place feels too profitfocused. The front desk staff is extremely aggressive about calling and calling to schedule appointments. I also had a minor clarification issue with my insurance that made them unable to access my account with the insurance company the day I visited. The front desk person said she would call me if it couldnt be resolved. I received no call from her but instead received a bill due immediately for the entire charge.  Users/jsg718

20100527 11:28:29 nbsp What a disaster  I would stay away from this practice, not so much for its dental practices but for the unbelievable rudeness of the staff.  Ive rarely felt as mistreated as when I had to deal with them concerning a billing error.  When you have so many wonderful dental practices in Davis, why on earth would anyone go here? Users/Bessie

20110309 15:44:25 nbsp Highly recomended!! I have also have had bad dentist experiences in the past and basically written off dentists all together, then I was refered to Dr. Meinert by a coworker who had nothing but good things to say. Ive seen a few dentists in my life and do not have the healthiest teeth, and Dr. Meinert and staff treat me not like a patient, but as a friend. All proceedures were smooth and painless! Dr. Meinert actually had me laughing as he was extracting some teeth! (Again, my teeth werent in the best shape. I love the sign in the office that states; You dont have to floss all of your teeth, just the ones you want to keep.) I refer all my family and friends here and am confident that they will be well taken care of! Users/MarkPeterson

20110328 21:02:00 nbsp Great office staff and dentist! Im so glad I picked Dr. Meinhart out of the list I received from my insurance company. Thanks to Wiki for a place to share experiences and help each other out!   Users/YogiJen

20111208 When I called I was welcomed with a very nice receptionist who took down all my information.  They even called my insurance company for me before I came in!  When I entered into the office it was nicely decorated.  The seats were comfortable and the office smelled soooo good!  They had their Christmas decorations up so it was very festive.  The  receptionists were nice and cherry.  I would recommend this office to anyone.  Im so glad my insurance told me to see Dr. Meinert.  He was really nice.

20120328 09:25:41 nbsp Im usually a wuss when it comes to dentists. For that reason, I avoided going to one for the past year and a half, even though I broke a filling about nine months ago. I expected it to be a painful, financial bloodbath  probably just because Im conditioned to feel that way about dentists and because of that broken filling. Anyway, I got two fillings at a totally reasonable cost (after insurance) and Meinert polished my front tooth (which I once broke in half while playing basketball in a swimming pool) for free, while the novocain kicked in. None of it hurt (which had been my experience as a kid. I must not numb easily). Happy to have knocked everything out (from cleaning to fillings) in two short visits.  Users/justincox22

20120629 14:10:42 nbsp I’ve had various insurance plans and thus, experience with many of the local dentists over the last 30 years. I’ve never used Davis Wiki to choose any service, but currently have no insurance so no restrictions placed on which dentist I can select. I started reading comments on those whom I’ve had experience with and quickly learned how to read through the subjective for my determining factors: Price, honesty, competence, availability. After the footwork, I chose Dr. Meinert. Here are my results & review: Price Out of the 7 calls I made, this dentist is at the very affordable end, albeit his office is located in central downtown and is lovely. Discount for cash payments, btw. Honesty When I explain the reason for a visit, they know what procedures may be necessary. What I want is a low to high estimate of work to be done, time and price. I rank honesty by their response and the result. This office was the only one that gave me an actual breakdown right on the phone. There were no surprises, padding or pushing for more work when I left. So, big thumbs up. Competence I’m not a dentist, Im a physical anthropologist, but I know how to read an xray and judge the degree of severity. Thats as qualified as I get to measure the work. What can be said: Dr. Meinert gives quick, effective shots, there was no wait time for a magazine in the seating area or in the chair and the Dentist himself gave me an estimate for an extraction while we were looking at my xray. Some professionals are shy/cowardly about money talk preferring to hand that off to the admin. Based on that, the entire staff are skilled, personable & efficient. Availability I was able to get an appointment within 2 days of my call and I didn’t feel crammed between five other patients. As I was leaving, the women at the front desk said to give a call when I was ready for an exam and cleaning. I definitely will and would recommend this dentist to anyone.

20120820 14:14:57 nbsp Office staff is horrid. They filed my claim incorrectly with my insurance, refused to correct it and even reported me to the credit agency. I litterally had to call my insurance to get written proof of this and the office still refused to correct or admit wrong doing. Will never go back again. Its sad because Dr Meinart is a wonderful dentist. Should just get better office staff. Users/rubberyducky

20120912 13:22:13 nbsp I would highly recommend Dr. Meinert. I finally got Dental Insurance and made an appointment with Dr. Meinert after reading reviews. I went in for a cleaning and the staff was so nice and the lady that did my cleaning was very thorough about making sure I understood what I was seeing in my xrays and always about what she was doing to my mouth. I have gone to alot of dentists when I didnt have insurance and I will say that Dr. Meinert was a good choice. Also, when I got the detailed print out of what I needed done to all my teeth, they didnt make me choose to have the most expensive ones first, they let me choose the ones I could afford to have done first. Most dentists I have gone to, want the most money the fastest. Dr. Meinerts office gave me options with prices. I will recommend him to anyone looking for a new dentist in Davis area.

20131017 16:36:27 nbsp I have switched Dentist in Davis last year and have been seeing Dr. Meinert. I have always had a great experience. The staff and Dr. Meinert are very knowledgeable and make you feel very comfortable. The hygienist are all friendly and gentle. They have a nice office located downtown that overlooks 3rd street. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a Dentist to go see him. The Hygienist are really good!!  Users/deamion
