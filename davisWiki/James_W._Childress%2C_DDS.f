20070306 23:45:03 nbsp Ive been fortunate to have Dr. Childress as a dentist for the last few years. Hes very thorough and really sweet. The office is wellrun. I dont think hes taking any new patients, but Dr. Samer is. Ive had one soso experience with one of the dental hygenists, but other than that Im extremely happy. Users/RobinLaughlin

20070914 16:15:12 nbsp I have been going to Dr. Childress since before I could even read  he is great, although honestly I dont see him much.  Mostly, its just cleanings and xrays.  He is very helpful and has a gentle but firm way of encouraging me to better habits when needed.  Hygienists are very professional and friendly (true for all of them Ive ever had over many years).

20071004 03:05:42 nbsp Dr. Childress is an amazing dentist and a very friendly guy. I had a dental emergency when one of my teeth broke and a longtime Davis resident and friend recommended Dr. Childress to me. He is very knowledgable and he really makes you feel at home when sitting in the chair. He eases tension with humor and there were a few times when I tried not to chuckle while he was working on me. His work is very thorough yet very unpainful.
I would highly recommend Dr. Childress. If Hannibal Lecter had a good twin, it would be Dr. Childress. Theres something classy and gentle about him.  Also his staff was very friendly and helpful. Users/BenjaminCatabas

20080619 19:03:08 nbsp Dr. Jim has been my dentist for MANY years.  I currently travel 40 miles to have his gifted hands and office staff perform all aspects of my dental health.  He is currently maintaining the dental health of 3 generations of my family.  His work is truly amazing, and would be impossible to beat.  Im a very fortunate and dedicated patient.  Jim, keep up the extraordinary work!!   Users/apeterson

20091016 05:45:33 nbsp Dr. Childress is the absolute best.  You can tell he takes great pride in his work, is so kind, and does not need to resort to anything shady.  I love people who become successful the hard way.  I once had an appointment with Dr. Samer and he was pretty awesome as well.  Dr. Childress has been my familys dentist for over a decade and we wont go to anyone else.  I think he got the Best of Davis award once  deserved it. Users/adverselypossessed

20140123 14:54:20 nbsp I started going to Childress and Childress in the early 1980s, because one of them was a UCSF grad, and I was referred. How lucky was that? Very: Dr. Jim is not only a consummate professional, hes the gentlest dentist whos ever treated me. I dont believe hes able to accept new patients (see the 2007 comment above, to see how long thats been true). Given the excellence of the offices support staff, I think checking out Samer Alassaad Dr. Alassaad would be a wise choice. Users/DougWalter
