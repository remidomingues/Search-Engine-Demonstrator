Welcome to the wiki,
Are you still renting from Acadian right now right now? Do they still plan to make you pay for the painting? Tell them its A Bad Faith Deduction and you will kick and scream to small claims court, who will hold them liable for 1.5 times the amount...

If you have the time and the inclination, drop me a line.   Users/StevenDaubert
