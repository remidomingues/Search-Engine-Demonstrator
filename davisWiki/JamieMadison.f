Hello....are you trying to get to know Davis on the little screen here?  If you want the live tour I can show you the microneighborhoods of Davis and tell you all about it. I grew up here, attended Davis schools, my children attended Davis schools, and after a career in computer software, I now help people find and sell their Davis homes.

I love what I do, I have the ability and availability to help you out in a calm and fun process.  See general information at my website http://www.movingtodavis.com or get current information on our market at http://www.davisrealestateblog.com. Then call me  lets talk about your situation, needs, wants...

A little about me?  I live on Putah Creek between Davis and Winters where my husband has been creating a bird preserve for the past 20 years (his preretirement day job was as a professor at UCD).  I love shopping, cooking and feeding friends (worked at http://www.chezpanisse.com/ Chez Panisse in my youth) and think that the Davis Farmers Market is the best thing going.  I am on the board of the http://www.yolocf.org Yolo Community Foundation I love art. We have a vital art community here with truly remarkable artists, gallery owners and ongoing events.  Many people know me from my family of writers  cookbooks, local commentary, childrens books  and farmers.
