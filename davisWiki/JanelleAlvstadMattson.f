Do you know what California is missing?  Deep fried cheese curds.  They dont even have them at the State Fair!  How can you not have http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurlhttp://moblog.co.uk/blogs/1124/moblog_93a974aafa3b8.jpg&imgrefurlhttp://moblog.co.uk/view.php%3Fid%3D23249&h387&w516&sz31&tbnidVDF5DlhhQLs25M:&tbnh96&tbnw128&hlen&start1&prev/images%3Fq%3Dcheese%2Bcurds%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26rls%3DRNWE,RNWE:200506,RNWE:en fried cheese at a state fair???  Heres my recipe:

Janelles http://www.mnstatefair.org/ MN State Fair Deep Fried Cheese Curds recipe

(Not exactly like those at the fair, but close!)

Batter:
  1 cup flour
  ¼ cup corn meal
  ¼1/2 tsp salt
  1 tsp baking powder
  1 egg
  3 oz (1/4 3/4 can) of beer

Mix batter (adding beer a bit at a time) until its a thick liquid consistency.  Coat cheese curds in batter and drop into oil (about 375 degrees) about 5 at a time.  Cook curds for about 1 minute (until they start to turn golden) and place on paper towel covered plate.  Enjoy!

Cherry Garcia.  Ok, so technically its frozen yogurt, but close enough.  Man, that stuffs addictive. Users/RonB

20071005 11:09:02 nbsp Howdy, glad you figured it out.  By the way... my wife and I were supposed to visit Ithaca for our honeymoon (as part of a slow offhighway roadtrip from Erie through southern NY state and then up vaguely toward Boston).  Alas, somebody brought a nasty bug when they showed up and we spent our honeymoon sick for a couple weeks.  Were hoping to do it next year: loosely planned byway travel is one of our favorite activities. Users/JabberWokky
