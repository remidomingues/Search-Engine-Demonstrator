Often mildly out of touch with reality, Janet is a Undergraduate Students senior college student by day and a trashy t.v. showloving geeks dork by night time night. She cant change the world but maybe she can brighten yours just for a moment. She loves buffets pigging out, which can be seen on http://www.janhung.yelp.com. However, this hobby can be quite detrimental to her Free Food wallet.
