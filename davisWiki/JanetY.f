Describe Users/JanetY here.


20130916 12:49:38 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Janet. Using your real name has always been a concern on every Wiki Ive been involved with. Front Page really isnt a proper place to discuss it, so I moved your comment to Identity/talk. Theres also a page called Importance of using your RealName you might want to check into.  Users/PeteB

20130916 13:20:55 nbsp And even some of us editing with nicknames are quite friendly and have plenty of get to know you info on our editor profiles. Users/JabberWokky

20130916 13:42:51 nbsp Janetplease dont change Front Pageagain it is not the proper page to hold a discussion. Users/PeteB

20130916 15:27:27 nbsp Whats your real name then, Janet? â˜º Users/ConstantiaOomen

20130916 16:12:10 nbsp PeteB, are you the owner of the Davis Wiki?  Who gets to decide what goes where?  Doesnt this violate the spirit of the Wiki? Users/JanetY

    Janetthere is no owner of the Wiki. This a communityrun Wiki and decision is made by consensus. Did you look at the first comment on this page I left youplease do so. Theres some good info for you there. Users/PeteB

20130916 16:46:10 nbsp Actually, what I said is something I will very much stand behind.  Feel free to call me to discuss this: (814) 8898845.  Youre insisting that a bunch of other people are acting in the wrong when they correct you.  Either a bunch of people who have been using the wiki for many years have suddenly and irrationally decided to single you out and pick on you for no reason, or youre simply making an accidental mistake over and over again, and thus demanding that your way is the only way.  That unilateral demand with no willingness to talk to other editors is rude, but (and I make this clear in my comment) is either out of innocent ignorance or willful malice.  Im giving you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you are simply confused.  Several others have moved on to assume you are simply being a jerk for the sake of being nasty.  Im happy to continue to consider this simply a terribly bad introduction simply because you are unfamiliar with the wiki.  Again, if youd like to talk, Im extending an offer to a friendly chat and try to help you out: (814) 8898845. Users/JabberWokky
