Janet Jacob served on the DJUSD School Board from 1973 to 1977.  She served in the West Plainfield district seat which had been held by Robert Downie for 11 years before.  After Jacob finished her term in 1977, the West Plainfield district seat reverted to another atlarge seat in the district, following a districtwide public vote in 1975.  This one district seat was a vestige of when DJUSD merged with the Fairfield school district, which only had one school, Fairfield School.  A condition of the merger was the guarantee of board representation from residents of the old district.
