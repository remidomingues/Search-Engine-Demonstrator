The January 5th 2008 Storm resulted in an extended Power Outages power outage. To see how the community reacted and the storm developed, see the history of Power Outage.

A power outage started on 20080104 and ended 20080106, affecting many parts of Davis. Please list businesses that are open, intersections that are down, and areas that have no power.  It may not be a good idea to list specific addresses of residency without power, for safety reasons, but neighborhoods and regions would be helpful.  Across Northern California, over 1.4 million homes and businesses lost power.

Yolo County has an http://www.yolo.com/oes/ official situation website for updates.  There is also a http://www.yolo.com/oes/water.htm levee and waterway map that tracks potential and current flooding.  The City of Davis has a http://www.city.davis.ca.us/emergency/ web page with information, and a hotline open at (530) 7475400 (or weekdays: 7575686). To report a downed powerline or other dangerous situation, call (530) 6668920.

When you get your power back:

Check your refrigerators and freezers.  If your power has been out for an extended amount of time, its very likely that your food has spoiled, or will spoil.  For safetys sake, it is highly advised to chuck out most of your food.  If you remembered not to open up your freezer at all, and if you had a lot of frozen items, that food may be OK (ours was still frozen solid after 30 hrs). If you were out of town or away from your home during this power outage, keep in mind that your power may have been off for some time and it is possible that food in your refrigerator/freezer defrosted and spoiled, but has since refrozen with the restoration of power. Such food may not be safe to eat. It is advisable to ask a neighbor how long (if at all) the power was out at your specific location. If in doubt, be safe: throw it out.

The following is information about http://www.redcross.org/services/disaster/0,1082,0_564_,00.html food safety after power outages from the American Red Cross. A summarized version appears at the end of the following http://www.davisenterprise.com/story.php?id101.0 Davis Enterprise news article about the after effects of the storm.

You can also contact PG & E to get up to $25 http://www.pge.com/customer_service/safety_net/ reimbursement if your power was out for longer then 48 hours.

Media Coverage

The http://davisvanguard.blogspot.com/2008/01/stormandoutagesdemonstrateneedfor.html Vanguard has written an editorial criticizing the response of PG&E and the city of Davis to the power outages.  However, the blog praised the Davis Wiki and the Enterprise:  The two best sources for information were on the Davis Wiki and the Davis Enterprise Websites. (Again you had to be mobile enough to get to a place with power for that to be helpful).  Even then there was not a lot of information. That is by no means a criticism of either the Wiki or the Enterprise. They did the best they could. The information was just not available and that falls squarely on the city of Davis and PG&E.

20080105 10:12:02 nbsp It appears that DCN and Omsoft have been affected by the storm. I have no DSL connection as of the time of this post and havent since before noon yesterdayalthough service seems to have been up for an hour or less earlier this morning. Their Websites are also unavailable.

If they are in fact down, it would have been nice if a representative of either organization had posted something on the Wiki. Users/DavidRobinson
  I dont know if that should be among their highest priorities or not. I have been checking their tech support number (7500101) and it has the Friday AM message still on the recorder. Users/DougWalter
  Doug, Im not sure that it should have been among their highest priorities, but if there is an outage and if it has lasted over 24 hours, as it seems to have, perhaps notifying the outside world through the Wiki might have been one of their second, third, or fourth level priorities. Its just a thought. (And for the record, I do think that restoring service should be the top priority, in case anyone has the idea that I thought that they should have spent the  day letting us know something was wrong and not solving the problem or problems that seem to have caused the outage.)users/DavidRobinson

20080105 12:10:26 nbsp Just wondering if anyone in the stonegate area has power as of yet. The country club is lit, but it looks like everything on the east side of lake and into village homes is dark. Hope everyone is staying dry and safe. Users/ebone
  We havent lost power, but were on the west side of Lake in the Marina Circle area. Users/JimEvans

20080105 12:24:01 nbsp Also, just wondering if “trees falling on the powerlines” as the automated pg&e recording claims is equivalent to nonmaintained infrastructure like old power poles falling down? as was clearly visible on Russell west of Pedrick and on Covell west of Lake. If not, maybe pg&e should invest some of the gobs of cash they charge into proper maintenance and storm preparation. Just a thought. Users/ebone

20080105 17:05:40 nbsp The area around J & L and 2nd to Covell is still down and the PGE person said it would be another 8 to 10 hrs before they even had a rough estimate. A tree came down in someones back yard on a major trunk line. We havent been able to find any place to stay, hotles are booked. Why havent they installed underground wiring long before this with the rates they charge?  Users/Renngrrl

  It is open, but no produce. See the Power is out section on this page.

20080105 22:53:39 nbsp Safeway has power, probably thanks to a generator, but theyre not selling any frozen foods or taking credit cards. That whole area on Covell is dark and the light on Covell and Sycamore is still off. Users/LizethCazares

20080105 23:22:45 nbsp Does anyone know if the SaveMart ever lost power?  Sounds like the Coop and Safeway did.  Im looking to buy some nonsuspect milk, my own milk being quite suspect at this point. Users/CovertProfessor
  SaveMart (as well as the other businesses in that particular shopping center) was not affected by the power outage and has been open as usual. Please refer to the Businesses Open section earlier on this page.
   That told me what is currently open, not necessarily what was never closed.  But thank you  you answered my question.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Apparently, SaveMart never lost power.  I went to Longs on Friday morning, and Longs never lost power because, according to the store manager, they are on the same power grid as the Hospital (on the other side of 113, go figure).  Panda Express didnt lose power either. Dont know wny SaveMart never lost it.  Im sure (or I hope) Safeway will/did throw out all their perishables.

20080105 23:31:35 nbsp The power came back on Santa Rosa between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on Saturday.  Aint light and heat wunnerful? Users/BarbaraKing

  Do you have DSL or cable? Our DSL does not appear to be working still and I dont know if its a telephone issue or a provider issue.

20080106 09:02:01 nbsp Are those 7 60ft pole lines back up on County Road 102?  Is there road access through that area?   Users/AnnieSirrah

20080106 09:02:32 nbsp Power in North Davis (North of Catalina & Covell) came on at around 5:00 pm Saturday.  However, Cable is not working.  DSL is working, but I use SBC.  If people are using Comcast Cable, then their internet connection is down.

20080106 10:17:48 nbsp I lived in North davis and power is finally back on as of yesterday at 5pm, comcast, direct tv is working as well.As of yesterday night around 9pm when I was biking and talking to friends drake is still out and parts of sycamore. We were without power for over 34 hrs here. The damage is scattered throughout davis, trees branches everywhere, bus stops blown into the middle of the road. I think PGE is doing their best, lets hope that the mw storm is not as damaging. Also any suggestions for freezer,refrigerator throwout advice( i know all dairy, milk, salad dressings? what about eggs?  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20080106 10:19:29 nbsp At least some parts of Drake Drive have their power on this morning. Users/JasonAller

20080106 10:32:58 nbsp North Davis Meadows (out by the city golf course) is still without power.  My folks called the PG&E outage line and were told not to expect power until Monday night; they consider the information suspect however as the customer rep thought Davis was in Sacramento County...   Users/HeatherRumsey

20080106 12:33:22 nbsp As far as I know, the Amtrak station doesnt have power, but the trains are still running at a slight delay. Users/Kafani

20080106 12:38:44 nbsp Does anyone know if DJUSD public schools are in session as usual tomorrow?  There is nothing on their website and, as with most things in this outage, little information available. Users/LizSweet

20080106 12:46:21 nbsp Power still out at Oxford Parkside Apartments. About 50 hours now. Users/NicoleBush

20080106 12:51:31 nbsp F Street residences got power back around 12:00 AM Sunday. I havent been out to check the intersection at 14th yet... Users/LizPhillips

20080106 13:00:59 nbsp When this situation has been resolved, I think there should be two separate pages here: one for power outages in general with information on emergency services and whatnot since it is unlikely that this is going to the be only major power outage ever, and a second documenting this particular power outage. Im not acting right now because I think the general power outages page should be named something along the lines of Power Outages and that this current page should be renamed to document the dates that this power outage occurred, and since its not yet over we cant do that. Any thoughts?  Users/ElleWeber

   Agreed  its always good to keep historical material!  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   Yup... that was pretty much my take on it too.  The entry history also gives a neat timeline.  Users/JabberWokky

   Starting January 5th 2008 Storm to collect historical information and photos. Users/JasonAller

20080106 18:52:35 nbsp Most food even in a fridge is probably okay.  My house was 55 degrees, so the found never was in a warm location, the door stayed shut for the most part.  I tasted my milk last night and it tasted fine.  Food takes awhile to spoil in cool temperatures.  So test your food, much of it is probably perfectly safe. Users/DavidGreenwald

20080106 21:42:35 nbsp AT&T phone lines are not in service around the Sycamore/Anderson area, estimated repair is 9pm Monday, 1/7/08. Users/KellyM
  AT&T lines are now up as of 11:15am, 1/7/08
  Mine is still out (same area) as of 9:40pm, 1/7/08, plus their offices are closed so I cant call for updates. Help/advice? Users/KatherineChiu

20080106 23:26:20 nbsp Power back on Anderson & Russell area at 12:20am 1/6/2008. AT+T DSL service restored at 9pm. At least for me and my roomie, the phone line (AT+T) is still out and is projected to be restored 9pm tomorrow. If JimmyLPhilo is still wondering about Drew Circle, power seems to have gone out but been restored, although reportedly the heat in at least one complex is still not working. Users/KatherineChiu

20080107 12:50:56 nbsp Per PG&E, as of noon today, there are 54 customers without power.  Largest grouping is a group of 22, next largest is 13 rest are ones and twos.  No estimate on restoration other than they are working on it. Users/StephenSouza

20080107 14:03:39 nbsp As of last night, many of the frozen/refrigerated aisles at the Marketplace Safeway were empty. Users/JonathanLawton
 yes supermarkets cant risk any type of possible contamination, however David is right; if you never opened your frig/freezer and you didnt have the heater on in your house (meaning it was in the 50s) most of your food probably is still ok. Users/MattHh
  Actually, it depends on how long your power was out.  A closed freezer wont keep foods cold enough indefinitely. I had cooked stew in my unopened freezer and my power was out for more than 48 hours.  My stew leaked which means it mostly or completely thawed. Perserving or eating it would have been a no no. Please see the link above to the info about food safety in outages from American Red Cross, above.  Their guidelines stipulate that certain food temps rising above 40 degrees for more than a few hours should be discarded. Users/AnnieSirrah
