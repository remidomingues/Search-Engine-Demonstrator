The Japanese American Student Society or JASS (est. 1982) is a student organization at the University of California Davis with an eye to service, social and cultural happenings.

We deal primarily with the Japanese American community, but that doesnâ€™t mean you have to be Japanese to join; anyone with an interest in Japanese culture and community can join our group!

EVERYONE IS WELCOME!

You can find us on Facebook too!
