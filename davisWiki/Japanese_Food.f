Japanese Food can be found in a variety of venues in town including several restaurants. One of the most common types is sushi.

wiki:WikiPedia:Sushi Sushi (literally vinegar rice) is a type of Japanese food that is quite popular in Davis. You used to be able to see a line in front of Fuji Chef in the morning before it opened, but the opening of Davis Sushi Buffet a short distance away thinned things out. The California Aggie Marching BandUh has a BandUh Sushi Challenge sushi eating challenge. There are many opinions about which sushi Restaurants restaurant is the best in town. Several of these restaurants offer allyoucaneat buffets.
   Enju
   Fuji Chef  The classic Davis allyoucaneat sushi lunch buffet. Loud, crowded, popular, and often interminable lines. Very quiet at night, with food quality low to good.
   Jusco  Carved niche as the other buffet for those impatient for the Fuji line. Low quality sushi, but also offers dinner allyoucaneat.  Decor is vinyl booths in StarTrekCounselorTroigreendress green, left over from previous occupant.
   Manna  Actually a Korean restaurant, but offers many Japanese rolls and tempura plates.  Decent bargain for meals.
   Mikuni  One of a small chain of trendy Japanese sushi restaurants.
   Moshi Moshi  Second in quality if Zen Toro takes first place, but certainly first in innovative rolls.  However, dinners are not cheap and rolls are rather small.  Excellent presentation of all dishes, and lunch plates are excellent deals.  Sleek, clean dining room.
   Nami Sushi
   Nobu Hiro  This is the restaurant to go for decent Japanese food at a good price.  The lunch buffet is cheaper and mostly better quality sushi than Fuji, though far less variety.  Like Jusco they also offer dinner all you can eat on weekdays.  However, the regular bento dinners and lunch specials are excellent bargains.  Far away from campus and downtown, but in return, minimal wait and crowd noise.  Erases memories of the old Nobu joint (what poor food it ended up having, despite earlier glories).
   Ohana Hawaiian BBQ  Hawaiian cuisine has been influenced by Japan, and you can see it even at Ohana. Here you can order musubi (Japanese: omusubi AKA onigiri) and chicken katsu (Japanese: torikatsu).
   Sushi Unlimited  Located where Mirai and Tokyo Japanese Restaurant used to be.  Not allyoucaneat sushi, but lots of sushi choices and other Japanese food.  Many reviewers have noted that the quality does not match the price  (similar prices to Moshi Moshi and Zen Toro)
   Zen Toro  A new Japanese restaurant in Mansion Square that offers the best quality fish in Davis, and perhaps the most elegant presentations.  However, their side dishes have been noted by some to be borderline unservable.
  Davis Oshio Cafe  Just off campus, this is one of the newest of the Japanese restaurants. They are gaining a reputation for good quality to price ratio.

Japanese Food is of course now also sold in most supermarkets in the form of sushi, nigiri, edamame beans, and gyoza potstickers.  At least three of Davis supermarkets make their sushi on location:

   Davis Food Coop  in partnership with Mermaid Sushi  downtown
   Kims Mart  technically Korean but offers many of the same or very similar foods
   Nugget  North Davis
   Otos Japan Food  in Sacramento, but nearest store fully dedicated to Japanese goods
   Safeway  South Davis
   SaveMart

These markets offer good quality sushi at lower prices than restaurants, without the service.

Although the existing Japanese restaurants of today are centered around sushi along with a few core dishes of Japanese cuisine, Davis was once home to Japanese restaurants that provided more variety:

 Crepe House Uni  A Japanese chain restaurant that offered authentic fastfood favorites rarely found outside of Japan.
 Kamon  A nice little place that served homestyle Japanese food
 The Ramen House  Similar in food and atmosphere to ramen shops commonly found in Japan, this was a small restaurant dedicated to the famous noodle soup.
 Tokyo Japanese Restaurant  This was possibly the first real Japanese restaurant in town.

20060220 10:33:06 nbsp This has more to do with homecooking than eating out.  Does anyone know how to make a good Zaru Soba soup base?  I can get the noodles, wasabi and nori at the Nugget, but Im stuck on making the soup base.  Also, if theres any local restaurants that serve good Soba, Id like to know. Users/GrumpyoldGeek
   Most Asian grocery stores stock zaru soba sauce base which you can dilute to your preference.  Try Kims Mart. Users/KenjiYamada
    Thanks Kenji.  Get a chance to try Optimator yet? Users/GrumpyoldGeek
