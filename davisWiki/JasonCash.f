JasonCash seems to be rather excited about Microsoft OneNote. He added a link to a graphic advertising OneNote to several page on the wiki during the evening of Oct 13th 2005. According to wiki ethics this was questionable and so his contributions were reverted.
  Me thinks this is a onetime bogus name never to be used again and probably doesnt even deserve this page. I doubt hell be back... (Not to waste too much time on this, but he comes from 67.114.39.73 which is a Pacbell (Yahoo) DSL address.)
    This page was created in an effort to be friendly and helpful to those who may be unfamiliar with our site and the local etiquette.  Most likely, you are right, but this page does little harm and is an excellent example of how the wiki deals with annoyances, which is to turn them into something positive.
