20080803 10:50:15 nbsp Jason, I noticed that you deleted the for free part of the tool lending note on the bike shops page. Is that no longer a free thing, or is it just that not all of those listed do it for free? Users/TheAmazingLarry

20080915 10:40:18 nbsp Im not sure why you consider it to be advertising for the Bike Kitchen or about the Kitchen trying to oneup the Bike Church.  There wasnt even a hint of a statement that the Kitchen has been around longer or that it served as a model for the Church.  The addition was only meant to help the introduction by providing an example that many people are familiar with (yes, some people are more familiar with the Sac Bike Kitchen than the Davis Bike Church).  Both organizations have the same goal, and thats all that really matters so I didnt think it would set off a turf war.  Anyway, a separate links page is fine too, only requires more maintenance.

20101007 10:26:07 nbsp Hi Jason,
