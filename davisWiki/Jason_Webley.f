wiki:WikiPedia:Jason_Webley Jason Webley lives in the Seattle area on a houseboat but traditionally plays in Davis for Users/RobRoy Rob Roys birthday in early October, as he has done for the last two years; first at the Pirate Ship and then at Delta of Venus, both times with http://www.myspace.com/CorpusCallosumBand Corpus Callosum as the opener. He also has played Whole Earth Festival. Outside of Davis has played all over the world both solo and with such groups as The Dresden Dolls. He tours almost nonstop.

Along with a song with the same title, he has interesting ideas on how to celebrate on Columbus Day.


Webleys performances are very high energy with lots of crowd participation. He plays the accordion, a guitar, and a bottle of vodka filled with coins from around the world. His music can be heard at http://www.myspace.com/jasonwebley myspace.com/JasonWebley

There is a facebook http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group_profile.php?gid5072 group called Jason Webley Is the Greatest Performer This Earth Has Ever Seen, which should give you some idea of the devotion of his fans.

Jason Webley has this amazing way of charming the crowd, he can get his listeners to do whatever he wants. Seeing him at Robs birthday was so awesome. I sing his drinking song all the time. Users/MichelleAccurso

I too once found myself captivated by this genius musician; I danced like a dervish and drank like a fool.  Single greatest night of my life. Users/AndrewBanta
