Starting June 6th, 2008, Java California will no longer be opened for business. They are currently selling their inventory (including Torani and chocolate syrup, tea, and coffee) for a discounted price. They will be opened for limited hours everyday until the final closing day. 

This was a great place.  It was no longer open 24 hours, but from 5am to 1am.  However, they said they would stay open later if students are still there studying. For a night owl, it was an oasis in the desert of closed businesses.  During the summer they closed earlier, which isnt surprising if youve seen the absence of people there during the summer.  They were open on all holidays too.  They had a Buy 10, Get the 11th drink free card.


 History 

Java California was in business for 8 or 9 years, and was under the management of John for about three and a half years. John sold Java California some time after 20070306.  The shop continued to be open 24 hours and the last owners were Larry and Users/LoriLuporini.

 Coffee Shop 
This was an awesome place to study and hang out! One might have wanted to bring a jacket, it was colder than outside.  Like a lot of coffee shops, it had a few bookshelves full of books that you could look at (it turned out that these were for sale, but in store perusal was OK), and it had a shelf full of board games that you could play on the spot.  There was a large bookshelf full of games running from Risk to Jenga, including a copy of Davisopoly, which was created by John, the former owner of Java California.  Additionally, it had some couches and comfortable arm chairs, etc.  Like a lot of places in Davis, it had free WiFi.  Unlike a lot of places in Davis, there were plenty of outlets to plug in your computer.

Java was broken down into three areas with unwritten rules of noise level.  In the main area where you enter and order your drinks, being louder and chatting with your studybuddies was ok.  The second area had the couches, bookshelves and bathroom; people tended to be quieter in this area but briefly discussing with friends was ok.  The third area was the meeting room; here everyone was quiet just like it is the library.  Please remember to shut the door between the meeting room and the second area.

 Cool Extras 
Beyond these normal coffee shop amenities, Java California also had a business center and meeting room.  The business center consisted mainly of a copy machine and some tools like a stapler, a papercutter and a light table.  The copy machine made black and white copies for $0.08 and color copies for $0.80.  (it worked 60% of the time.)

The meeting room was a large room with about 10 folding tables and 40 wheeled business chairs.  When it wasnt reserved for meetings, it was open for studying and made a great study room.  Most nights, people were very quiet in this room and it felt like you are at the library.  The meeting room also had a small whiteboard and a TV/VCR combo.  Finally, they provided a PA for free if you needed it.  The meeting room was free to use as long as you were using it for nonprofit purposes.  They even had an occasional LAN party.  As a note to studiers, you should have checked the schedule before you got too comfortable in the room, because you could be kicked out by people that scheduled it.  During finals, the room could be reserved for studying.  The schedule for the meeting room was posted from time to time (maybe weekly?) on the Craigslist events calender (try a http://sacramento.craigslist.org/cgibin/search?areaID12&queryjava+california&cateee search for Java California).  To find the right posting, just look for events in Dixon.

You were allowed to bring in outside food and drink, were encouraged to hang out, and about the only thing you could do that is against the rules was bringing in Starbucks  they had the rules from other coffee shops hanging on the wall with each rule marked Okay with us!.


The meeting room.

 The Product 
The coffee was pretty good, and they had an extensive menu.  This included several specialty mochas and 9 flavors of whipped cream.  The whipped cream was made with real cream (and WhipIt).  In addition, they had a variety of snacks from donuts and pastries to Cup oNoodles and ChefBoyardee ravioli.

Recommended:

  Whipped Cream
  Raspberry tea
  Lemon Ginger tea
  Caramel anything (they use real caramel)
  Mint Chip Chiller (or any blended drink)
  No Carb Blended Mocha (make sure its blended... good even if you dont care about carbs, simply because its less sweet and more rich and ice creamy)
  Krispy Kreme doghnuts
  Hot Cup O Noodles $1

 Gone now.. but not forgotten 
They used to (until 2007 with the new management) have two internet connected computers that could be used free of charge, as well as a play area.

There used to be a small play area stocked with toys, a gumball machine, and a bouncy ball machine.  It has been replaced by three oneperson desks, with a pencil sharpener.




Unfortunately, some people feel that this place scores low in ambiance. They say that its flooded by flourescent lights, you can hear the Interstate 80 I80 traffic, the furniture is cheap, and theres all kinds of crap lying around, as if it were a childs nursery.

   I feel compelled to note that Ive been going to JC for quite a while now, and Im a semiregular night customer there. I see and meet a lot of other people who go there either regularly or just occasionally, and the only complaint I ever really hear of is overcrowding. Most people like the atmosphere Johns set up, and like the fact that it has a smalltown independent sort of feel. Its hard to complain about the overcrowding even, because it just means that the place is doing well and will probably be around for quite a while (and honestly, its mainly only overcrowded during finals and midterms at UCD). Users/EricKlein

VERY cool place.  Users/JabberWokky

This place is actually quite nice. Ive been there several times in the middle of the night to either hang out or work. As said above, the coffee is good, but the atmosphere is what makes it. The staff is friendly, and the free power/wifi coupled with the coffee and food selection makes it possible to stay there working for very long periods of time. Unlike a lot of places, this place is so cool, I WANT to spend money there, to support them for being such a great place to go. My only complaint is that theyre in Dixon, rather than Davis, so biking out there in the middle of the night isnt as convenient as if it were in Davis.  Users/EricKlein


This place is great, as long as youre not a punk to the owner. He used to host live music Friday or Saturday nights. My brothers band used to play there all the time until the crowd got to be too much. (You just cant control metalheads under 18.) But last I heard they still have great music on some weekend night. Further and more detailed information would be available on the white boards in the meeting room.  Users/MichelleAccurso

20050724 18:42:31 nbsp Friendly people, good drinks.  Dont forget to tip. Users/IrenePark

20050819 14:20:46 nbsp If you go in there soon, make sure you congratulate the owner on the birth of his first grandson! Users/JessicaLuedtke

20051003 13:02:20 nbsp This is an awesome place. Its very comforting when finals are rolling around and you need to learn a quarters worth of material out of one bloodshot eye. The owner is always pleasant and nice. Ive only been here once during the day to use their desktop computer for a long time when my internet was out of action in the summer and it was even more enjoyable in the day time than at night. Its nice to see a small shop succeed and deserve it too. Users/LiRic

20051130 16:56:28 nbsp All businesses should be modeled after Java California Users/GiladGurantz

20051215 01:11:03 nbsp I came here once over the summer for the very first time. Since Fall quarter started, I have been here studying w/ my roomate. The manager is super nice and funny. I really wish there are more coffee place like this one. The staff here are awesome as well. I enjoy the study area here especially the coffee.  Users/AlexandraLiu

20060116 00:53:11 nbsp Hey, isnt that guy in the big kids room the Math Departments own Spyridon Michalakis? Users/RoyWright

20060509 10:48:47 nbsp By maintaining the community room, Java California is providing an essential service to the city. If for no other reason the shop should be patronized.  But happily, Java Californias house coffee is the best tasting in town.  Solano Bakings home brew is watery and tasteless.  Starbucks sells the usual overpriced and harsh concoction. Users/PeteBasofin

20060610 23:35:26 nbsp  I LOVE JAVA CALIFORNIA. I am entirely too busy during the day to make it to another cafe to study...esp if it closes 2 hours after I get there.  I was there so much during winter quarter 2006 that I got onto the Deans list for the first time during my four years here. NO JOKE! )  John is such a nice guy...gives out free food to starving and studying students once in awhile and he even reserves his large meeting rooms for finals!  And I really really love the mocha chiller...its freakin perfect!  Users/TereseSantos

20060611 08:35:32 nbsp I love this place. Working on the IAJ over Spring this quarter I spent two allnighters there with my home PC. They are great hosts, with great food (and better service), and best of all, a lot of outlets. BEST PLACE TO STUDY Users/AlvinTsao

20060807 17:12:44 nbsp This is the place to find the absolutely BEST caramel macchiato!!  Users/CissiePerkins

20061024 23:28:51 nbsp Java California is awesome! I can see myself spending many a late night here. Big, comfy study areas, wifi, and an unlimited cup of coffee? Count me in. The only problems are that its amazingly cold here and the noise from the traffic can be distracting. Still, mad props for this wellplanned business. Now if youll excuse me I have to get back to studying :) Users/SteveKent

20061031 21:26:15 nbsp In short, the cafe is great and the owner is awesome.  On at least three occasions that Ive gone there at night, hes tossed out jokes and given out freebies to cut down stress. Users/DanAlcantara

20061108 14:30:21 nbsp I love studying here.  I just curl up on one of the reclining couches sipping my hot tea and study.  Johns a really nice guy and if youre there at the right time, hell give away some pastries. Users/JoAnnaRich

20061114 15:12:49 nbsp Just for your amusement: a list of things John did when bored during our NaNoWriMo writein: http://fullmoon.typepad.com/nanowrimo/2006/11/i_love_java_cal.html  Users/JenniferRutherford

20070223 00:00:02 nbsp I was there a couple nights ago. John stopped by and told some painfully bad jokes that we all still managed to laugh at. After he left, about 2030 minutes later, an older woman walked in asking to take pictures of us studying. She announced that she is BUYING Java California and needs to pictures for some business somethingorother... I guess its been sold. Users/JesseSingh

20070223 05:26:04 nbsp WHAT!!??!?!?!! Users/JabberWokky

20070223 12:32:12 nbsp Yep, thats exactly what I thought. Someone in the room pleaded Dont change anything! to which the forthcoming new manager said Im not going to change anything, why would I? But I got the feeling she was just patronizing us. I should also note that, while the study room was full that night, maybe 40% of the people there walked into Java Cal from the other entrance and just plopped down on the table, without buying a drink. No wonder John has to sell it. Users/JesseSingh

20070224 23:55:17 nbsp LOVE this place.  I kind of wish others didnt love it quite so much, so it could be a little less crowded. Users/MattHh

20070225 17:30:23 nbsp ( Alas, next week, John will no longer be the owner.  I was there studying earlier today and it is confirmed ( Probably one of the last times Ill see John and get to hear the funny jokes. Users/JoAnnaRich

20070225 19:26:48 nbsp It would really be cool if somebody could get one of those big cards and have all the regulars sign it as a goodbye gift.  Johns a rather unique character, and hes one hell of a good guy.  Other than making people suffer through his jokes, he honestly cares about his customers. Users/JabberWokky

20070228 13:33:56 nbsp Best place to study ever! Totally worth the drive. Only thing that sucks is when theres tons of people and when theres really annoying girls who talk too loud. People are trying to study, geniuses... and that sucks that John isnt the owner anymore! Users/CourageCowardlyDog

20070320 14:38:01 nbsp Thanks to all you FAITHFUL and LOYAL customers who have been coming to my brother Johns Store these years that he has owned it, and thanks for indulging him his jokes!  : )  I know it touches John that you have been there with him, through thick and thin, and no matter what, you have been loyal and his friend.  Since I now live in So. CA I dont get to the store that often, but it pleases me and warms my heart to see what John has created for himself, the community, and YOU, each of you.  I know it will different without John there at the helm, and it was not an easy choice for him to make.  Join me in sincerest wishes that John will now pass on to the next place in life he belongs.  And when you do see him, give him a BIG BEAR HUG from me, his Sis, Cindi.  God bless you all. Users/CindiWatermanBissellKidd

20070328 14:41:51 nbsp Thank you to all who support Java California.  We are the new owners, Larry and Lori Luporini Users/LoriLuporini

20070505 13:08:48 nbsp Its ok, the person behind the counter is super slow. Its nice that it isnt as stressful as say mishkas, but not really worth the drive. Sac has some better coffeeshops.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070513 23:23:35 nbsp Oh man.  I went back to Davis this weekend for a visit, an naturally I thought Id hit up good ol JC...  What a disappointing experience.  Whats with all the fake mahogany furniture?  And the rooster lamps and other kitchy junk for sale?  No outside food or drink, WTF?  And no more computers!  I couldnt bring myself to buy anything so I cant testify to the food/drink.  I dont believe Ill go there again...  I wish I had spent more money there when John was the owner. Users/MaryLieth

20070515 02:53:02 nbsp Maybe people bringing in outside food and drink is one of the reasons John had to sell. Users/JesseSingh

20070522 03:25:00 nbsp As much as I enjoy walking it out and partying like a rockstar...needs less loud fm 103.5 late at night. Otherwise this place is cool, the annoying giggling conversations die down at about 1:30am, then you can really study uninterupted. The coffee is good too, and the bathroom door sounds like a fart. Users/IanBenton

20070625 21:42:02 nbsp Bathroom smells like death and its always either too hot or too cold, but the coffee and studying atmosphere is great especially late at night. Lori is really nice and gave me a kahlua blast chiller for free (she had created it that day and wanted someone to try it). Its soo good! Everyone should remember to at least buy one drink when studying or hanging out, so they can stay open 24 hours and keep wireless free. Users/MandiPeterson

20071104 10:30:20 nbsp I dont believe this place is open 24 hours anymore. According to their hours sign on their window, they close at 1am almost every day. Ive been here several times, making a trip out here from Davis just for a good quiet place to study. Their meeting room is probably the best place  and hopefully, there arent groups back there chit chatting if you needed it to be quiet. The owner is affable and also offers some sort of art class there as well. Id say, if you cant find a place to study in Davis, then give this place a try. (oh, and i usually get the red eye) Users/at86

                I just called them and their official hours are 5am to 1am now.  They said that if students are still there studying, they will stay open late. Users/apalley

20071117 21:51:18 nbsp Owners came in and said we cant bring in outside food and drink anymore.  Good place to study in the meeting room thats a lot more welcoming, than say the 24 hour room, although it feels suspiciously like a campus lounge.  Okay food/drinks.   Users/BessieChu

20071213 21:10:00 nbsp I can attest to what apalley said  I was there earlier this week and they will stay open as long as there are customers. Interesting literature to read (and for sale as well).  Users/AndrewLeonard

20080525 23:10:11 nbsp Im at Java CA right now. I still love this place. Hot chocate with caramel and white chocolate whipped cream is delicious. And the wifi is locked unless you buy something so thats cool. And finally, the people behind the counter are always interesting and personable. I always find myself chatting with the person behind the counter.  Users/MichelleAccurso

20080526 09:36:09 nbsp i have been kicked out at around 11 for closing, there were only about 3 people there, but it would be nice if they had set hours that they definitely would not close until unless there is no one there. Just my opinion, but i understand that they are a business and if no one is ordering anything anymore, they probably close to be cost effective. Users/MattHh

20080528 21:23:45 nbsp Im sorry to hear that this isnt open 24 hours anymore. It was a great spot to study late at night/early in the morning when I was a student. Users/PS2

20080531 18:48:12 nbsp This is definitely my favorite place to study. The big meeting room is great for studying and really sprawling out with your books / laptop / materials. Im not a coffee drinker, but I always order an iced chai tea latte with almond roca whipped cream (highly recommended  their flavored whipped cream is amazing!) and now they also have a great chai frappe. The employees are great. Very friendly and personable, and if you ask you can get a Java Card which theyll stamp with each purchase  after 10 drinks youll get a free one. They always have fun stuff going on, like little community bands coming to play. Not the most convenient for some Davis students, but I prefer it this way as it usually is not too crowded with students. Users/ChrissyNoble

20080603 21:03:49 nbsp I want to be the first to say that I am crushed that Java CA will be closing their doors. When I spoke with the owners son today he told me the main reason why their closing is that the costs for supplies are becoming far too expensive. I had some great study memories at this place...so sad to see it go.  Users/EmilyTung

20080603 22:11:18 nbsp Oh no!! This is so sad...I will have such great memories of Java California as well. Im really going to miss it...I shed a tear when I found out its closing! Best wishes to all the Java employees. Users/ChrissyNoble

20080608 20:46:02 nbsp man this sucks, i had a lot of good studying times here too (if those exist). i even drove out there today to find a closed sign on the door. i was halfway to the starbucks when i came to my senses and went back to davis.

heres wishing someone buys it and moves it to davis, they would get a lot more people in there, as the article says, in a desert of closed businesses. Users/IanBenton

20080609 11:13:52 nbsp Well there will always be the coffee at the fast and easy ... yuck!

I really wish davis coffee shops would experiment with longer hours.  Davis kept one alive in Dixon for what? As long as Ive been around at least (thats 8+).  Seems to be enough market for some of the smaller shops in town. Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20080912 20:28:24 nbsp I have lots and lots of good memories of this coffee shop.  My friends and I used to go there on a regular basis about 4 years ago when the original owner was there.  He was the coolest guy.  Then some mean lady took it over and changed the hours and changed everything and it wasnt the same.  And now its closed.  Im very sad to see it go.  :(  Oh, and I do agree that a business like this needs to exist in Davis and STAT.  If only for those procrastinating students.  a 24hour coffee shop was invaluable to me in college. Users/SarahOsler

20091123 04:00:54 nbsp :( I feel like I missed an incredible place Users/GreatRyan
