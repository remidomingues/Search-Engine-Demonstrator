Describe Users/JayChou here.
Welcome to the Wiki, Jay.  Changing the attribution on your comment, like you did on the Wake Forest Apartments page, makes it seem like youre trying to disguise yourself, since readers cant see who left the comment.  Its also a bit Shadiness Factor shady to make it look like youre speaking for the Wake Forest management, when clearly you arent part of it anymore.  In what way did you work for them?
