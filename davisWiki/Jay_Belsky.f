Jay Belsky is a child psychologist at UC Davis.


He was in the news in June 2011 with his comments about Egalia, a Swedish preschool which aggressively banned gender from all aspects of the school, including language, not acknowledging the gender of the children attending.  Articles pointed out that he questioned whether it was the right way to go, quoting him as saying, the kind of things that boys like to do  run around and turn sticks into swords  will soon be disapproved of.  He added, So gender neutrality at its worst is emasculating maleness.
