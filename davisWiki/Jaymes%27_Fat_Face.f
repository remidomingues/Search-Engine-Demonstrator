Fat Face in its current form is a food stand at the Davis Farmers market. They serve grilled cheese sammies and pops on Wednesday evenings, and breakfast egg sammies and pops on Saturday mornings. Select flavors of Jaymes popsicles can also be found at the Davis Food Coop. You can read more about his philosophy, special flavors, and local sources Aisu Pop here.

Jaymes used to have a storefront in Davis (see below).




Jaymes Fat Face is a gourmet popsicle shop which also serves sammiches and soup for lunch.  Its the brick and mortar location for Aisu Pop.

The shop is located at 425 L St  Suite C, directly behind Floors To Go and close to L Street Furniture, Bikram Yoga Davis, Rodness Martial Arts Center, and Bike Forth.  Its a bit off the beaten path but is the only place in Davis to get a gourmet popsicle outside of the Davis Farmers Market Farmers Market.

They will be closing sandwich operations at the shop on March 11, 2011.  See the image below for details:



20091102 12:38:52 nbsp Wow I get to be the 1st to comment! Fat Face is awesome. Went to the grand opening yesterday and had a super yummy BBQ pork slider, ginger lemonade, beignets, and red pepper tomato soup.  Skipped on the pops but must comment that they really cant be beat.  All of them are so delicious and fresh flavors (especially the thai iced tea sweet potato pop my personal fav). Highly recommend everyone go check it out for your weekday lunch fix or your sweet tooth cravings.  After all... froyo is so 2008! Users/HeatherMartin

20091106 12:40:49 nbsp Yummy!  Today, I had the roasted pork and persimmon sammich and roasted pepper and tomato soup. She also had Mexican Coke today, so if you like your Coke in bottle without high fructose corn syrup, Jaymes has it. Users/ScottLay

20091106 15:03:59 nbsp Congratulation Jaymes.

I have always love your pops. I now love your sammiches.  Users/ThUn

20091111 17:57:40 nbsp Im looking forward to trying this out.  The Fat Face sign itself is worth commenting on though.  Whoever drew the pig did a great job.  I enjoyed it just driving by in the car. Users/EdHenn

20091203 12:32:22 nbsp just came back from there and im in the middle of wolfing down the roasted pork and persimmon sammich that has frisee and goat cheese too. i dont even know what frisee is but its delicious. im sure it means crack in another language because i could eat three of these in one go, theyre so good. i dont really go for funky combos in a sandwich but i took a leap based on jaymes recommendation and she is right on the money. speaking of jaymes, i doubt you can find a cooler or nicer person to talk to. shes totally awesome. i tried a pop and i inadvertently laughed out loud from surprise because they taste exactly what theyre named after. sounds silly to find pleasure from something like that but just try one and youll see what i mean.
A+, thumbs up, 5/5, absolutely recommend this place.

totally diggin the sign too.  Users/beekergene

20091203 12:35:44 nbsp sigh...while writing my review i finished my sammich without realizing it and now i feel lost and cold and alone. its that good.  Users/beekergene

20091206 15:07:49 nbsp The sammiches are amazing and Jaymes is so nice! I love sitting in there eating my sammich, chatting, coloring on the table, reading the newspaper... Im officially addicted. Ive tried the squash, roast pork and persimmon, beer poached fig, smoked salmon, plus breakfast sammiches... I get pretty happy when I check the menu feed and see a new kind, I cant wait to try more! I just wish the shop was open everyday! Why such limited hours?  Users/SRB

20091210 15:19:13 nbsp Im with beekergene... the roasted pork and persimmon sammich is awesome! yummy yummy... I dont usually like goat cheese, but I tried it, and with the persimmon and secret sauce... soooo good! Thanks Jaymes! Users/AdrienneW

20091211 13:31:46 nbsp Be sure to check the “current menu” link at the top of this page before you go – you can make sure it’s open that way.

Fat Face has a very casual atmosphere, but the soups, sandwiches, and pops are top shelf delicious.  This is a local business well worth supporting! Users/K.Lee

20100107 13:31:42 nbsp Beer Poached Figs, Caramelized Onion, Arugula, Goat Cheese sandwich.  Are you kidding me?  Its fabulous.  I cant wait until Im hungry again so I can go back an get another.  Be prepared for cash only. Also have had the egg sandwiches at the Farmers Market which are great too.

Once you find this place, youll be back.

20100129 19:42:24 nbsp The people of Davis DEMAND evening and weekend hours at the Fat Face shop!!! Users/atwong

20100131 16:45:25 nbsp Went to the Farmers Market this past Saturday and went looking for Jaymes Fatface stand. Bought a Cajun sammich (egg, anduolli sausage, and collard greens on a crispy ciabatta bread) and a thai tea+sweet potato popsicle. Price is a bit high, but I really like supporting local businesses. I really enjoyed my meal. Sammich was excellent and the popsicle was like a frozen thai tea (didnt quite taste the sweet potato)! Overall, a great place for me to hit up after a long bike ride during summer! Keep up the great work! Users/BrandonToo

20100228 00:15:42 nbsp I went in for lunch one day and was presently surprised to find such a cozy place.  I had read these reviews and thought I had to try it.  Now for my review: I had the pork sammich with everything on it.  The pork was tasty, cooked to perfection, and had great texture.  Bread was fresh, spread was delicious, and veggies were awesome! The pork actually really reminded me of Vietnamese prepared pork (Im Vietnamese) and it was nice to find something strangely familiar.  I ordered half of my sammich for dine in and half togo...but I ended up eating both halves right then and there. You gotta try it peoples Users/juicee

20100310 11:01:43 nbsp Please bring back the grilled cheese on walnut bread!  I keep checking the menu and it is never there anymore :( Users/CharlieMurphy
  Have you tried asking if theyd make one?  A lot of places will still make stuff even after they take it off the menu. Users/TomGarberson

20100310 11:29:14 nbsp When I saw their sign with sammiches at the Farmers Market a couple months ago I wanted to correct the spelling.  I remember the pop was interesting.  I cant correct the spelling today.  Its been a kind of frustrating day. Users/BruceHansen
 The spelling is intentional.
 I fiigured it was today since its correct for Type of Food.

20100312 15:04:42 nbsp So Im at work and I thought I should comment on the delicious sammich I just ate. I cant say how glad I am that I stopped by Fat Face. Its a bit of a hole in the wall and I assume that the majority of people dont even know it exists, which is a shame. They really seem to have created a very thoughtful menu, even if the rotation only consists of four or five sandwiches at a time.

I had the chicken salad sandwich, and there was something really buttery and garlicy in it that was just amazing~. The only thing about these sandwiches though, is that they are on the small side. Im small so the full suited me just find but I imagine that its not enough for people with larger appetites. But hey, I guess those people can just buy two then.

Ok, back to work and back to offending people with the garlic breath  :\ Users/KMP

20100317 18:45:05 nbsp Ive never really been a big fan of sandwiches.. Most sandwich places have not enough meat for me and too much bread. Im not a big fan of most breads, but the bread here is so good. Ive tried the smoked salmon and the bacon and egg sandwich offered at the farmers market. Both are sooo good. You can tell the ingredients here are all super fresh. Ive only tried the Thai Tea w/ sweet potato but it is amazing. This place is awesome.. Ill be back soon. Their sandwiches seem small but for a big guy like me its pretty filling, just have a popsicle for dessert and youll be good! 

Users/glulu

20100319 23:28:57 nbsp Finally went to Fatface and very much enjoyed it. I had a grilled cheese sammich with aged cheddar that was delicious.  The fanproduced art of the pig and the popsicle monster gives this place such a friendly vibe.  Ill be returning for sure to get that pork sammich they were out of today. Users/EdHenn

20100325 16:23:33 nbsp I returned for the Braised Pork sammich today, and its a delight.  The pork has so much flavor, with just a bit of homemade cheese and some greens.  Jaymes seems to have the knack for very simple but delicious combinations of tasty ingredients.  This place is a winner. Users/EdHenn

20100329 14:42:12 nbsp Everything made by Jaymes that Ive ever eaten has been absolutely delicious (not the best word, but I dont think theres a word that exists that can describe how good the food is). At Farmers Market, my boyfriend and I always plan to try something new or something we havent had in a while, but can never resist getting another sammich. Users/pwong

20100403 12:36:23 nbsp soooo jazzed about this place.  I have always LOVED her breakfast sandwiches at the Farmers Market and pleased that she now has a storefront.  Im eating the roasted tomato soup from FM as I type and I just cant wait to visit the real spot bc I know it will be a delight.  THIS is the kind of place the city of Davis needs more of. Users/soledad101

20100429 15:14:43 nbsp I wish that I had gotten two of her grilled cheese sammiches. They are that good. The atmosphere is really fun, everyone is nice, and the popsicles are incredible. Everything I have ever tried tastes like sunshine and happiness inside of my mouth. Go to Fatface. Users/Ldish949

20100521 19:56:00 nbsp Thank you Jaymes for a wonderful anniversary dinner!!  We loved it and it was so awesome we were able to make it happen given the newborn baby at our house. We will give our highest recommendations to others and may just do it again at home for the fun of it!!  Fatface rocks the house yall! Users/HeatherMartin

20100617 19:49:11 nbsp Oh my goooodnesssss fantastic. My boyfriend and I have been eyeing this place for months but we both have wierd schedules so we can never get over there at the appropriate times, UNTIL TODAY!. I had the fig n goat cheese sammich, boyfriend had the braised pork. The fig sandwich was like unicorns, glitter, and happiness in my mouth, A plus plus plus oh man. Braised pork was awesome, but not as good as the figgie :) boyfriend complained they were smallish. They ARE kind of small but I felt satiated, personally, and very pleased with the quality of the ingredients, overall taste and of course the finishing touch of lightly grilled bread. Not enough places do that.  Wow. Users/JessicaWinter

20100623 15:36:02 nbsp Im not a big fan of the popsicles, but this place has the best sandwiches in town. The new bacon sammich is simply fantastic, the crispy bacon is cooked to perfection, the buttered bread is crunchy, the tomato and the arugula are fresh, and the avocado sauce is heaven, you can feel the love they put into it, best BLT ever! Users/icastano

20100625 12:50:54 nbsp Just tried Fat Face for the first time today, and I can honestly say its one of the best eateries in town.  Great tasting sammiches; you can tell that a lot of care and attention to detail is put into their preparation.  Its cool that Jaymes makes what she herself enjoys and isnt afraid to put interesting ingredients into the mix such as goat cheese and fig.  Some of the pops also have unique flavors such as avocado mixed with lime and thai tea mixed with sweet potato.  Dont be intimidated; youll be surprised at just how well everything works together.  Overall, very delicious and creative menu!     Users/ScottMeehleib

20100810 11:02:56 nbsp Great honest food and I love the egg Sammiches at Farmers.

I was also going to write that I would want a shirt with the logo on it but I just saw on facebook that its in the works, awesome! Users/BamCam

20100822 14:28:31 nbsp This place is the ultimate. Ive had the beer soaked fig sandwich twice and the cocacola pork sandwich once. Both were super yummy. I now try to get to this place at least once a week.  Users/jsg718

20100905 11:06:08 nbsp Never having had Fat Face, I wanted to get the full experience when I saw the stand at Farmers Market. I got a breakfast sammie and the mint ice tea, and on my way out I got a peach and berry popsicle. It was pretty much fantastic. The ice tea was especially impressive  it was sweet, and incredibly minty in a special way. And the popsicle had a great texture. Wasnt like an ice cube, so I could crunch it perfectly and enjoyably. Plus, I really enjoy that the peaches in that popsicle came from fellow Farmers Market folks, and its all a local effort. Thanks for the deliciousness, cant wait until next Farmers Market to get something else! Users/ChristyMarsden

20100923 10:13:48 nbsp very good sandwiches with a really nice and friendly atmosphere in the restaurant. Users/DagonJones

20101210 19:53:15 nbsp This place is amazing. Great find for foodies. the beer fig sammich and thai lime and avocado pop are some notables. I highly recommend this place. Jaymes is super friendly and its got a great vibe.  Users/DonHo

20101214 15:25:10 nbsp Went in here after hearing about how good their sammiches are. Got the cola pork and I have to say it was the smallest, most over priced sandwhich ever. It barely had any pork and was pretty bland. I might go back and try a popsicle in the summer though Users/JasonS

 Hi Jason, thanks for taking the time to write about your experience.  I am very sorry we disappointed you on the cola pork.  Pork is possibly my most favorite food group and I apologize the sandwich underwhelmed you so much.  Since seeing your comment, we have been paying extra attention to the cola pork to make sure it is as flavorful and satisfying as it should be.  Thank you for giving Fat Face a try and helping make us better.  If you are interested in providing more feedback to help us improve, please dont hesitate to contact me directly via email or phone found on this page. And if you do decide to come and try that popsicle please let me know as I would love to say hello! Jaymes aka Users/PopsicleGirl

20101215 20:57:21 nbsp I finally managed to get into this place today.  I wish it were open during weekends and evenings, (although it kind of makes finding this place open a special treat).  Anyway, I tried the pork sandwich on recommendations from DW, and I have to agree with most of the above: it was very good.  The pork was super tender, the way pulled pork should be, soft and melty.  It came with avocado, which I wasnt expecting, but it turned out to be a good combo, and I liked it in the end.  The sandwich did disappear a little too fast, but it wasnt on account of it being small.  It was more that it tasted really good and I ate it too fast.    Users/jefftolentino

20110107 13:55:33 nbsp You guys are just amazing! Seriously, my officemates and I have upgraded Fat Face to #1 sandwich destination in Davis. <3 <3 <3.

Im just disappointed that it took us almost a year to find out about you. Whats with the crazy location? Users/KyleAmbroff

20110127 15:11:29 nbsp So completely yummy. I have only been twice, gotten the beer poached fig sammich both times, and I am completely hooked. Super fun and friendly staff, well executed and special food. Oh and the pops are killer too. Thanks, Jaymes and staff for making such fun treats! Oh and tip for consumers of fig sammich, put some kettle cooked black pepper chips on your sammy for a little extra salty goodness. Not necessary, extra tasty.  Users/CaitlinAnn

20110202 14:08:44 nbsp This place is amazing! Really Good Sandwiches! Users/ReiOkamoto

20110310 13:48:10 nbsp Went for lunch today...amazing as usual.  One of the true gems of Davis.  Sad to see them close the sandwich operation, but theyre on to bigger and better things :) Best of luck Jaymes. Users/aroach12

20110705 12:43:53 nbsp The shared location with Bows and Arrows on 19th between R and S in Sac is now open, the location serves Beer and Wine from 1111, Sammies from 113 TuesdaySat.  Looks like a nice space to hang out, with some tables outside as well. Users/IAmNewHere

20120130 00:10:27 nbsp The sandwiches they made had interesting ingredients, but they fell short of being good. Users/CarlosOverstreet
