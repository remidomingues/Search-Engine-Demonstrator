According to the official website, Jazzercise is a 60minute group fitness class combining cardio, strength, and stretch moves for a total body exercise workout.  It combines moves from hiphop, yoga, Pilates, jazz dance, kickboxing, and resistance training.  Classes are offered both downtown and in East Davis.

Its good for all ages, and can be modified to be higher or lower impact depending on a persons needs. Its a very good work out, harder than it looks, and fun to boot. The club here in Davis seems to be primarily women, of all ages and fitness levels.

 Class Fees 
 $38.00/month when using automatic withdrawal
 $94.00/eight weeks, cash or cheque
 $12.00/one class pass, cash or cheque

Plus a newstudent joining fee of $25.00. New students may also try a week of Jazzercise for free, before joining. Its usually worth checking the official Jazzercise website for special offers.

 What to Bring 

 Weights
 Exercise mat
 Water

There are some weights and mats available at both locations, but its better to bring ones own.

 Also Note 

Joining Jazzercise here in Davis grants access to Jazzercise at both class locations, but does not grant membership to the Davis Athletic Club. Conversely, members of the Davis Athletic Club can participate in the Jazzercise classes at the club without paying additional fees, but not the classes at the Odd Fellow Lodge.

On Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 9:00 a.m. we have a class that would be ideal for the formers clients of Jazzercise.  If you are interested, please phone 7576656 and we can offer you a free introductory session. Users/crpike
