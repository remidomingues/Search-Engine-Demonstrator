20090324 12:50:58 nbsp Dr. Brewer and her staff are wonderful!  I had a real fear of the dentist before I began seeing Dr. Brewer, but she is patient and kind and makes me feel at ease.  She and her staff take a lot of pride in their work and always do a great job.  I highly recommend her too! Users/LizSweet

20101202 09:51:08 nbsp Ive always been happy seeing Dr. Brewer. Everyone who works there was been friendly and patient and willing to explain things. When my mom was visiting from out of town had a dental emergency, Dr. Brewers staff worked her in and saw her the same day; that was wonderful.  Users/mnightingale

20120211 18:43:51 nbsp Her daughter, Kelly Brewer, also started practices maybe two years ago. She is nice, patient and very careful! She caught that I have an extra tooth, which was missed by my orthodontist. My fillings were always done beautifully! Highly recommend to everyone!  Users/YingshanHsu

20120619 11:00:58 nbsp Terrible, still have pain in my mouth from her dental work. She replaced the metal cavities to white and they have found there were cracks in my teeth.. just terrible. Users/Lisa530

20130619 18:24:36 nbsp Went to Dr. Brewer and her daughter during college. I had my teeth cleaned right before graduating and was told I had 7 cavities, I was moving so I went to a dentist where I moved in the Bay Area to finish treatment. My new dentist examined my teeth and found I had NO cavities and only needed an old filling redone.

Now I have to wonder whether or not I ever had any of the socalled cavities they filled.

Beware of their services. Users/StephanieMacedo
