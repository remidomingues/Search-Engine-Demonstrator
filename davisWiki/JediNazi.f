JediNazi is really the stage name for Freedon Nadd who is either a Jedi or a Dark Sith Lord dependent on his want.  Soon he will lead us all in the Sith uprising and Exar Kun War. He is also a waiter at various restaurants around Davis.

  Hello, JediNazi, and Welcome to the Wiki!  The goal of the wiki is to integrate info about the topic; you deleted a comment on the http://daviswiki.org/Aikido_Institute_Davis?actiondiff&version215&version114 Akido page.  Theres nothing wrong with business owners contributing or commenting on their pages, as long as it doesnt violate Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions nonprofit restriction or wiki guidelines (see the Welcome link above).  In this case, the comment should have been deleted because it was already on integrated onto the page (the line about when classes are is in the middle).  This is pretty common, where people contribute information via the comment bar.  Feel free, when appropriate, to use the edit button and integrate it directly into the page.  Cheers


     Regarding your comment to LWolk: a little harsh, dont you think?  Sometimes people get all peeved up and hold grudges, try a little patience maybe.   We wouldnt want him/her coming back with a new account and slightly different internet connection and trolling the wiki randomly.  It happens at least a couple of times a year, when someone gets upset and also happens to suck at communicating when upset, deciding theyd rather throw a large hissy fit.  Most of the time they wear themselves out within a few days.  Or people get tired of dealing with the angstfilled teenage rebellion inspired nonsense (why me? nobody understands! You dont get it!).  Its almost always business owners, who are understandably taking anything on the wiki related to their business very personally, but unable and unfortunately usually unwilling, to communicate or cooperate, instead acting like a petulant child.   Perhaps your in a Dark Sith Lord mood right now, but Id encourage you to take a step back and rethink some of your recent edits.
