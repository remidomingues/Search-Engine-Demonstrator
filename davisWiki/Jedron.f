Im not in favor of theft, nor am I in favor of being treated like one either. It is important to remember that the only rights we get to retain are the ones that we exercise. Users/JasonAller

20080309 11:40:22 nbsp Hey, nice rewrite of the Seattles Best paragraph.  Thats a pain in the ass to get all the details everybody thinks are important (meaning I dont think half are, you dont think half are, and somebody else doesnt think half are, but they are all different, sometimes overlapping points).  You did a durn good job integrating it all into a readable, fairly interesting and informative whole. Users/JabberWokky

20090131 22:07:50 nbsp Hi Jedron.  Do you have a source for your comment about Theo Albrecht on the Trader Joes page? Users/JonathanLawton

20090131 22:35:43 nbsp Theo Albrecht and his brother served in the German army during World War II. This was the Nazi Army. Theo fought in Africa and Karl served on the Eastern Front. Both of them were captured by the Allies and became prisoners of war. They were later released along with all of the other soldiers and the brothers started their supermarket chain.

This article states that both of them served in the army and Theo went to Africa while Karl was sent to fight on the Eastern Front:

I am not against Trader Joes. I like Trader Joes, but I just wanted to let people know where their money goes. Trader Joes is a foreign owned corporation and not a small local company. Money spent at Trader Joes goes to a trust fund in another country instead of staying in the US and helping our economy.

  Thanks for the links, I used them to update the TJs page.  I agree its good to let people know that TJs is not a small local company but I wanted to have some source for the information.  Users/JonathanLawton
