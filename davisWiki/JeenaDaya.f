20100730 16:40:11 nbsp Hi there!  I just saw your comment on the Welcome to the wiki/business owner Business Owners page.  Thats not really the best place to pose questions like that, because it is very easy to get overlooked.  In response to that, you can think of the wiki like a community library.  Everyone donates information, then people come in often to check whats there.  As such, when you remove/destroy comments that have been left by other editors you are destroying community property.  As said below, if the comments refer to outdated management, then they can be archived, but not deleted.  Since text takes up so little space we like to keep records of what was if only for historys sake.   Users/MasonMurray
