20060601 16:17:44 nbsp Hey Jeff. Deleting a page because you dont like what it says isnt the way the wiki works. Youll be overruled by me and everyone else here. If you feel that the page is unfair, then make it fair! Youre welcome to leave a positive comment. Users/KaiTing

20060602 11:18:42 nbsp I dont need to spend more time on this other than to say that to the extent that any single entity is singled out for comments when many like providers are on the landscape only begs the question of motives. s Users/JeffGarbutt

20060602 11:18:47 nbsp Since were discussing motives ... what is your motive for continually deleting the page? Perhaps Burger Rehabilitations Systems, Inc. Burger Rehab has something to hide? Anyhow, stop deleting the page. For one, youre just stirring up negative PR for your business. For another, this isnt the way wiki works. To learn more about our wiki and how it works, see Wiki Ethics. Users/KaiTing

20060603 02:33:57 nbsp Yeah Jeff, you may question the negative comments on your businesss page, but do it by adding content, not by removing it. Users/KenjiYamada
