20110720 22:21:45 nbsp I had my windows cleaned professionally for the first time, after living in my house for 17 years.  Well, it wont go 17 years again, that is for sure!  I cannot believe the difference!  I dont even want to put down my shades.  Im signing up for next summer, and I intend to hire Jeff to clean my gutters in the fall.  His work is wonderful.  It was a hot day and I have a large house, and Jeff went nonstop for many hours until the job was done.  I feel like I am living in a brand new house.  Users/bar775

20120306 16:48:05 nbsp We highly recommend Jeff and his company. He is friendly, professional and his work is just fantastic. Jeff has cleaned windows at several homes for us in Davis over the past few years. It truly makes a difference. The entire house seems to sparkle afterward, and the windows stay clean and bright for a long time. Weve already booked our springtime appointment. I cant wait. Thanks Jeff!

20120607 09:11:11 nbsp Oh, my goodness!  Wish you could see our sparkling windows!  Ive had other companies clean our windows  but they never looked like this!  The screens are so clean they are almost invisible.  Great service, very pleasant to work with.  A++++ Users/KathyColeman

20120721 21:30:03 nbsp Had Jeff out to the house yesterday to wash windows inside and out, both stories. The windows look great, and his assistant was really cool with my kids (always appreciated). I think that Jeff underquoted the job based on the amount of work, but he honored his original quote without us even asking. Hell be back.  Users/DanielBoxwell
