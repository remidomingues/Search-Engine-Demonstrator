20091102 18:25:23 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Hi Jeffery. You put this information on your userpage, but it looks like it might belong on an entry about your business. Let us know if you have any questions. Users/JasonAller

20091103 12:10:15 nbsp I would be happy to help you. I just have a few questions.

  Are you an employee of Davis Holistic Healing Center, or are you just someone who uses their building to offer your services?
  If you are an independent practitioner, do you put yourself out to the world with something like, Jeffery Kay, Massage Therapist?

In any case, I think you should create a page at Jeffrey Kay, Massage Therapist, Kay Bodyworks or something like that. You can click on either of those links, click create page, and get editing.
