Hi! This is about people me.

Im 53 years old, having been born wiki:WikiPedia:January January wiki:WikiPedia:1957 1957. wiki:WikiPedia:Eisenhower Eisenhower was president. I watched the wiki:WikiPedia:Moon_landing moon landing on TV. I saw the wiki:WikiPedia:Beatles Beatles on wiki:WikiPedia:Ed_Sullivan Ed Sullivan. I was almost 7 when wiki:WikiPedia:John_F._Kennedy JFK was wiki:WikiPedia:John_F._Kennedy_assassination assassinated. I was 13 when wiki:WikiPedia:Kent_State_shootings Kent State hit the media news. I graduated high school the year wiki:WikiPedia:Richard_Nixon Nixon resigned. I was around before there were cellular phone cell phones. Before there were payphone project touch tone phones. Before there were pocket calculators. Before colour television use became widespread.

Im a computer and internet computer Social structures hobbyist and professional. My primary jobs have been as an embedded software developer since 1980. Im also familiar with electronics in general, and handy around the house. Im an amateur photography photographer. Ive taken Tae Kwon Do and Aikido, though Im not currently practicing.

I like animals in general. Cats are my favorite pets. I like tea, but I dont drink it much because caffeine raises my blood sugar, and I dont like decaf. I dont drink coffee.

Image(jjn_LostWeight.jpg, 200, right, thumbnail)Last July I changed my diet; all I did was eliminate refined sweeteners and switch to whole grain products. I didnt do this to lose weight, I did it to feel better and to avoid becoming diabetic. As a result I stopped having sugar spikes and sugar crashes  and I found myself losing weight. I lost around 50 lbs without artificially starving myself, and Ive kept it off ever since.

If you notice that my face seems thinner in the second picture, thats not camera angles or lighting. The picture in the red shirt was taken just before I changed my diet.

I grew up in the Whitford development just outside http://www.downingtown.org/ Downingtown, PA, a semirural community about 30 miles west of http://www.pcvb.org/ Philadelphia. In 1982 I moved to Southern California Orange County, CA where I met and married Users/BlancheNonken. In 1990 we moved back to PA, settled in Southern http://www.montcopa.com/ Montgomery County and had two children. In 2005 we moved to Davis Davis, CA, and here we are. As of mid2010 Blanche and I are breaking up, shes moving to Nevada and Im moving to Rancho Cordova to be closer to work. (Ill finally be able to bike into work.)

Now living on Duke Drive. I love this location. All kinds of stuff in close proximity, plus bike and pedestrianfriendly streets and sidewalks. I walked to Omsoft to pick up my DSL MODEM. (And encountered Users/PopeChristof on the way there. :)

Got a job in April 2006. Unfortunately its in Rancho Cordova, so biking is impractical. Id consider taking the train if it was cheaper and not so bloody slow. As it is I fiddle with my hours to try to avoid traffic. The good news is, its a fun job, my boss is pretty cool, and it pays decently. Lost the job in March 2006, found a new job in August writing firmware for http://www.flypfc.com Precision Flight Controls, helping them make flight simulators. If youre into that check out the website, because we rent time on the simulators. (This is real flight training stuff, so dont expect a gaming platform.)

And here are a couple pics from the birthday gathering at Woodstocks Pizza! Users/MichelleAccurso turned 21, I turned 49. So I got a 49% discount, yay! Michelle got one of me, so I expect it to show up here soon.



20050814 21:28:47 nbsp welcome to the wiki!  Users/MichelleAccurso

20050814 23:40:20 nbsp Thanks. Users/JeffreyNonken

20050815 07:47:04 nbsp Darling!  Youre here! Users/BlancheNonken

20050827 22:13:23 nbsp Great pics of the Market fountain! :) Users/SummerSong

20050910 11:48:20 nbsp Thanks, but only one was mine (the crappier one  my phone camera does 640x480 but not very good quality, dammit). The other picture had already been uploaded when I went to add mine, I just edited it in. (I believe shes referring to the Davis Farmers Market page.) Users/JeffreyNonken

20050916 10:56:37 nbsp On the Job front, have you checked out http://www.rabbitsemiconductor.com/ Rabbit Semiconductor (formerly ZWorld) on Spafford?  They are big in embedded systems. Users/RogerClark

20051001 09:08:24 nbsp ah yes, but indefinite, possessive pronouns do have apostrophes. somebodys, someones etc. Users/ArlenAbraham

20051014 01:42:46 nbsp Methinks Jeffrey is Number 2. Users/ZacharyNorwood

20051111 21:47:29 nbsp My laptop is back and functional!  When is a good time to stop by with your machine? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  A little over a week after writing that, it broke again..ugh..

20061127 11:58:18 nbsp Hey Jeff, so does somebody make an LEDreplacement bulb for standard home incandescents?  Surely this is possible for especially spot lighting? Users/RalphFinch
  Yeah, but theyre spendy. Havent looked in a while, but you can do a web search if youre interested. From what I can tell, efficiencywise theyre about equivalent to fluorescents. Of course, they last much longer, are easier to dim (at least, they are if youre driving them directly  not as simple if youre replacing an AC bulb though, but pretty simple if youre driving with DC), and they dont have the disposal problems (e.g. no mercury). At this point theyre better for industrial, commercial, and architectual lighting where the economies of scale are different. High initial investment pays back because e.g. you dont have to pay people to constantly replace bulbs and ballasts. Users/JeffreyNonken

20080517 02:52:05 nbsp Hows it going, Jeff? Unmutual as ever, I hope. Did you hear? Rumors of a remake! It has been reported that filming has begun in Libya, with McGoohan in a cameo role, but this has been denied by ITV who are reported as saying that no casting or details for the remake are in place. Hope the rumors are accurate. We need the social satirical message of the Prisoner today more than ever! Users/ZacharyNorwood

20100701 13:32:29 nbsp Hmmm, well, moving out of Davis. Blanche and I are separating, probably going to divorce eventually. Im moving close to work, Ill be in Sacramento just outside Rancho Cordova. Blanche will be in Nevada along with Christof, Jess, and all the kids and pets. Users/JeffreyNonken
