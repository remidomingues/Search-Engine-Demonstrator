20070324 21:44:14 nbsp If you ever agree to talk to them when they come to your apartment, they take down your name and return more frequently (mostly saturday afternoons). I had to move to get away from them, and Im never being polite and answering the door for them again.. NO I DO NOT WANT ETERNAL LIFE PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE! Users/CaptainRush

20070618 13:37:45 nbsp If you tell them firmly and politely that youd rather they didnt call again, theyll respect that, even if you have a lengthy chat with them. If you really, really, never want to see them again, there are ways  they will shun any exJWs who have been disfellowshipped (think excommunication) or who have formally left (disassociated). I know, Im an exJW myself. Users/KevinWeedon

20080428 01:23:09 nbsp I decided to allow myself to have a chat with them; seemed nice enough. They keep coming back though. Again. and again. Im out a lot, so they dont catch me, but by my housemates last count, theyve been here 6 times this week. Gah. Users/StewartShearer

20080428 22:38:57 nbsp They used to come by my place all the time.  I used to tell them something different each time.  Telling them you eat babies is an effective way to scare them off. Users/CurlyGirl26

20100818 18:02:16 nbsp I left, and they still receive me with warm hand shakes. It isnt a cult...and they go to your door because that is what their doctrine says they should. Dont understand what all the fuss is about. Users/Markam

20101103 21:48:43 nbsp So far, the Witnesses in Davis ive come across are very polite and not the kind who show up too early. Ill pray to that! Users/MaryCarroll

20110918 21:13:32 nbsp A couple of them showed up at my door today. I talked with them for half an hour about theology and eventually they made an excuse to leave while I was still trying to explain that the serpent from Genesis and the angel named Satan from Job are not the same character. Their bizarre literalist interpretation of Revelation and their obsession with the end of the world are annoying, but other than that they seem like polite folks. Users/BarnabasTruman

20120110 19:20:43 nbsp Today two Jehovahs Witnesses  Watch Tower women showed up at our door. They were wearing dark sunglasses and I didnt like that. I knew somebody was coming because the neighbors dog was barking angrily. ☺ They said (I was just eating and hadnt even finished my bite of food): Excuse me, I know you are very busy, but can we... I looked down at their black and old bible saying The Holy Bible and said pointing at it: No, not interested! They looked rather overwhelmed and left. I felt a little bit guilty, but I know their drill and I think its totally pointless and I didnt ask for it too. I once talked to Jehovahs Witnesses and found they were totally in the dark and just summing up what they read in the Bible or in their Watch Tower leaflets. I do think its a cult and I think it shouldnt be allowed for people to try to impose and intrude at ones private home with these things. There is a difference between normal advertisement (which is good and legal) and trying to lay your belief on someone.  Users/ConstantiaOomen

20120610 13:43:01 nbsp Has anyone else gotten a creepy hand written letter from these people recently? It was written from a Malia Hall with a PO box in Winters. I want to know how they got my name and address but I dont want to engage them in any form of conversation.  Users/MikeyCrews
