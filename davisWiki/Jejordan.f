Hi, welcome to the wiki. I renamed the entry you made to East Davis CrossFit so that the title matches the name of the program. You can keep editing it under the new name; Fitness is a generic name that should really be used to point people towards all kinds of fitness programs and gyms.  Users/ElleWeber
