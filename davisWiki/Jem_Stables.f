20110511 19:43:54 nbsp I am an older adult who loves to ride horses.  Jan from JEM Stables is a joy to take lessons from.  She has several safe and fun lesson horses to choose from (my favorite is Macaroni). She also provides lessons for children of all ages with ponys that are perfect to learn on.  I would recommend her services to anyone who is interested in the world of horses. Users/Michelle&Zen

20111129 22:57:05 nbsp Jem was great when I rode there. I learned so much in a few months, and Jan took the time to really explain things to me and never intimidated me. Emma on the other hand is a little abrasive, I didnt mesh well with her and thats why I left. BUT Im not outgoing and like a calm place, and am not into the show scene. Jan was the only instructor that I ever liked, and I enjoyed their Appy, Max. Also their new facility is great. But some of the students can be a bit snobby, and some gossip happens.  Users/ShawLik
