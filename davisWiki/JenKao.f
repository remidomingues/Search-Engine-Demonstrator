  Absorbing NorCal culture, like a good SoCal Davis student.
  Loving http://www.oregonscenics.com/oaktrees.jpg trees especially in Davis
  Laughing and poking fun at herself (as a SoCaler), whenever she tries to use Glossary hella in a sentence.
  Sitting at the Arboretum, trying to stay away from... the Ducks ducks. Those hungry ducks....
  Walking around Safeway and Longs with cell phone in hand, reconnecting with home.
