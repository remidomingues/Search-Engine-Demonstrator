A brief history of Jenifer Selke:

I am new to Davis and excited to be here!  I originated in Michigan, spent 5 wonderful years in Hawaii, lived 7 soso years in Florida and have finally arrived in the place I would like to call home.

I have had the good fortune to be married to a wonderful person named Terry Duperron for the past 17 years.  We are looking forward to learning all we can about Davis, Sacramento and California, in general.

I hope to be working for UC Davis soon and making Davis our permanent home.  We also look forward to making some new friends who share our liberal, humanist and green living values.  Since we love dogs, we are also looking forward to adopting a new pet soon!
