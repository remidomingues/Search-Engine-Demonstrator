20060502 11:34:14 Do you have an alternative recommendation for Asian markets in the vicinity of Davis/Sacramento? I suppose its outside of the area, but how does SF Market compare to Ranch 99? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071023 14:25:50 nbsp I dont like the pad thai served here either, very much.  Its not terrible, but Its not my favorite (which is in another state back home.) Do you know where to find some authentic pad/pud thai around here?  Users/HappyGilmore
