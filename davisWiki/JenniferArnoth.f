Well well well~

Youve found me.

Not an easy thing to do!

If Im not wandering around playing my accordian, or teaching oboe lessons in my dome,  you are likely to find me in my one of my many secondhomes  the dance studios.

Someday, Id like to figure out how to upload an image because Ive tried a number of times and Im not doing it right.

Let me know if you want to help me get started.
