Hello!

 I like flying and I fly out of University Airport with the lovely people at Cal Aggie Flying Farmers CAFF.
 I am a perpetual Undergraduate Students student. Im not sure if Ill ever graduate.
 Related to both of the above, I am studying Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering.
 I like cooking, and I finally moved into a place with a yard, so Im looking forward to eating lots of food from my garden this summer.
 My new house is but half a mile from my old, mold moldinfested place at Parkside Apartments. I had quite an unpleasant experience there, I do not recommend that complex.

These are some of my favorite places

Restaurants Restaurants:
 Thai Recipes  Their curry is delicious and I love the fact that you can pick your level of spiciness.
 Burgers and Brew  Turkey burgers are awesome and they have a lot of additions that I dont see at a lot of places.
 Lamppost Pizza Lamppost Pizza  They have delicious crust and fresh ingredients. Yummmm.
 Chuys Taqueria  Best burritos around! They are the only place I know of that dont put salsa in their guacamole, so when I ask for no salsa in my burrito, I actually get it.
 Yolo Berry Yogurt  I love yogurt. I go there at least twice a week in the summer.
 Rajas  The old man is super nice and the food is delicious. I always leave feeling stuffed.
 Davis Sushi Buffet Japanese Restaurant Davis Sushi Buffet  I love salmon. This place lets me eat as much of it as I want. They also have shrimp tempura which is always good.
 Davis Creamery  I love ice cream.

Nonrestaurants:
 University Airport, of course. I spend all too much time there. Come by on the weekends and say hi! Ill be the lonely one sitting in the office when you get to go fly!
 Davis Farmers Market, especially Picnic in the Park nights. I love the music and its great to see a community in action. The foods not bad either!
 Pedrick Produce, on nonfarmers market days.
 Community Park. It helps that I live right across the street from it.
 Oxford Circle Park Big Kids Park  Wheeeeeeeeee, a merrygoround big enough for me!
 Lake Solano County Park is a great place to spend an afternoon. Its a bit of a drive (or bike ride!) but definitely worth it to have a picnic and take a walk along the lake. The ranger is nice too, even though he is a ranger. He only warned me when I didnt pay for parking (I paid shortly thereafter...), and he let me and my friend into the campground after hours one night (what kind of campground has closing hours anyway?).




20100405 07:44:32 nbsp What kind of airplane is that?  Theres a few pilots here, let us know a little more about your flying. Users/JimStewart

20100405 11:36:34 nbsp Thats a Cessna 172, though (little known fact) I was actually in the back seat when this picture was taken. I fly 152s mainly but I snag a 172 every once in a while when Im bringing other people along. Maybe one of these days everything will come together and I can actually get my license! Users/JenniferCook

20100406 11:44:27 nbsp Did you ever get your mold problems dealt with? Users/WilliamLewis

20100406 22:51:20 nbsp Kinda, not really. We moved out at the end of March and are now waiting for deposit money back (though Im not holding my breath). I am sure they are eager to paint over all of the evidence ASAP and not actually fix the problem so that a new tenant can move in. I will be giving my two cents on the appropriate wiki page when this ordeal is over with. Users/JenniferCook

20100406 23:00:18 nbsp The BBB and, potentially, small claims court are great negotiating tools.  Keep in close contact with them until you get your depositand after, if necessary. Users/TomGarberson

20100407 00:15:13 nbsp Thanks for the advice, Tom. Though I really dont want to, I plan on pursuing it further if we dont get our deposit back. Legally, we can sue them for damages and back rent starting when we first saw signs of the problem (October), but what I have discovered is that its really difficult to get people to back me up on this because so many programs have been cut because of budget cuts. Users/JenniferCook

20100717 22:50:50 nbsp Your comment brought to mind The Call by the Backstreet Boys for some reason. Users/hankim

20100718 11:04:57 nbsp Question for you: if I wanted to bring my kid to the University Airport just to hang out and watch planes land/takeoff, is that cool? Where is a good place to go so that I dont get Homeland Securitied into oblivion? Users/3prong

Youll have to tell me what its like :) One lady told me that the Coop and the Mom and Baby source have new born classes. The Coop one is taught by a midwife. She said you can meet a lot of moms and perhaps hear about different things to do with your newborn. I havent checked it out but I was thinking about it once Baby B gets here. Users/jenb

20120710 04:21:26 nbsp Yes! I had my baby on July 5th. We named him Owen. He has been eating all the time. Its a big adjustment for us. Users/jenb

20120716 17:46:48 nbsp Ya, the breast feeding part sounded a lot easier than it is. Ive been to la leche league here in Davis, they were awesome. Did you end up going to the Mother and Baby Source group? Ive been meaning to check that out. Users/jenb

20120726 23:54:38 nbsp That would be awesome. What time is the Coop group? Im definitely coming out of the fog. I felt pretty overwhelmed these past 3 weeks, especially with the growth spurt my little man is going through. Users/jenb

20120920 22:12:18 nbsp It was nice to meet you finally! Im looking forward to next Tuesday.  Users/jenb
