20070716 23:23:10 nbsp Oh dont give me crap about how I am closeminded or how I dont tolerate different lifestyles. I dont even know anything about your lifestyle or who you are. I deleted Davis Tripod because it has no relevance to the community at large. Nobody is going to be searching for it. Nobody cares about it. Its a term used by friends to refer to themselves. If you want to keep it, put it in your namespace. Dont clutter the wiki at large with stuff that is useless to the community. Oh, and please refrain from personal attacks in the future.

P.S. Note well that the page is vanity, not your group of friends.
