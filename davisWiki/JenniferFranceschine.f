Hi Jennifer, welcome to the wiki! Thanks for adding that info on fluorescent light bulbs to the recycling page. I moved your content down to the hazardous waste section and added section headings so that all hazardous waste shows up in the table of contents. In the future, please remember to preview your changes and leave edit comments when you save. It makes tracking changes easier and keeps a pages http://daviswiki.org/Recycling?actioninfo revision history cleaner. You can click the info button to see the revision history of that page.
