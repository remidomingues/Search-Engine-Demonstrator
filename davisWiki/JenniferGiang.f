Hi! Most people know me as Jeffer. I am a 2011 graduate from UCD, double majored in Asian American Studies and Women and Gender Studies.

When I attended UCD from 2007 to 2011, I was involved with a few things on campus.
  APIQ CoCoordinator for the 20102011 Academic Year
  A commissioner for Gender and Sexuality Commission GASC  Fall 2009 through Spring 2011
  Peer Educator through the LGBTRC  Fall 2009 through Fall 2010

I moved out of Davis in December 2011. I am attending grad school at UCLA for Asian American Studies and Social Welfare, but I seem to pop up in Davis occasionally and still find myself on DavisWiki every so often. :P


20101006 22:45:29 nbsp More people watch Recent Changes than youd think, so you might want to work out your withinorganizational issues offwiki, especially for a group that wants to be welcoming to all, appreciative of volunteers, etc.  Its none of my business (so feel free to tell me to mind my own), but just a suggestion...
