20130319 10:44:41 nbsp Ok, I have created a page for the Center for Integrative Animal Medicine!  Maybe you can fill it out a bit, since you have some experience with the business. Users/CovertProfessor

20130319 10:54:43 nbsp There are plenty of us who will help, so if you provide the basic information, dont sweat about formatting or anything.  On the other hand, if you do want to learn, plenty of people will be happy to help teach you the finer details of wiki editing.  It is your wiki, so add what you know!

20130319 11:51:26 nbsp Hi, welcome to the wiki and thanks for bringing my attention to CIAM! One of my rabbits has limited mobility and might benefit from trying out some alternative therapies. Have you used the doc or do you just know her? If youve used her services definitely post a review when you get a chance ) Users/MeggoWaffle

20130319 13:29:23 nbsp Hello, I don’t edit the wiki often but regularly use it for reviews and recommendations. I have not used the CIAM but I know someone who brings their kitty there for acupuncture and they are quite pleased with her services. When I was looking for a human acupuncturist for myself I came across your question about your pet and remembered my friend’s cat that goes to the CIAM. I was surprised she wasn’t listed on the wiki yet so I enlisted CovertProfessor to help create the page.  Jennifer Users/JenniferH
