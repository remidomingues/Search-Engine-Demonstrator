20100414 14:46:59 nbsp I followed Jennifer here, and have been going to see her for all my hair needs for over a year now.  I can only say good things about her!  She really listens to what I want and never fails to translate it to hair, and she can totally work with my wavy hair.  Once I wanted it little shorter in front and she trimmed it up for free.  Shes so sweet and I would recommend her to anyone! Users/madanielelwicz

20100415 13:52:38 nbsp I just got back from a haircut and I LOVE JENNIFER! I was a walkin since Im usually so crammed with things to do so once I had a free moment, I went in to see if anyone could do my hair. Ive had Roxie do my hair before but she was busy so Jennifer said shed fit me in. She really listens to what you want and are asking and then works her magic, but makes your hair look even better! I have flat hair and I told her I needed some volume up top, lots of front and back layers, and side bangs. By the time she was done, it was soooo pretty. The layers were beautiful and she gave me a lot of volume. She even gave me lots of tips on how to voluminize my fine hair. Honestly, I thought Roxie did a great job the first time, Jennifer was just AWESOME! Shes one of the younger gals in the shop and shes sooo friendly & easy to talk to. We did some interesting girl talk but shes also very professional when talking about hair. She even hugged me when I left! :) She only charged $50 and that was for an hour of shampoo & conditioner, wash, cut, blowdry, and styling. I definitely recommend her to everyone and will be sending my friend there soon. :D I think Ive finally found my stylist, and I am definitely willing to pay $50 plus tips for her haircuts!

20100504 11:18:11 nbsp Jennifer styled my hair for my wedding in October.  She took my lifeless straight hair, pulled it back in a way that gave me volume up top, and pinned in the loveliest, soft curls and added just the right amount of flowers.  It was great that I still looked like myself and I was comfortable, but elegant and gorgeous in all the photos for the night, through wind and all the hugs.  Ive been a patron ever since!  She gave me the most fun postwedding chop off the long hair cutest style wow I didnt know my hair could look that good hair cut!  Jennifer is creative, thoughtful, warm and fun! Users/LauraT

20110831 19:04:19 nbsp Jen is the best stylist I have ever had and Ive had a lot in Davis. She is creative, engaging, and always remembers what you tell her and she asks you about it after months. Shes kind, and hilarious in addition to being a brilliant artist. On a scale of 10, 10 being the best, shes the 10! Users/Kkaffka

20111128 19:39:31 nbsp I moved to Davis for college, and could not find a hairstylist I liked. I went to the style lounge for about a year and always felt very uncomfortable. the stylists talked to each other while completely ignoring me and did not listen to what i wanted. My roommate recommended I come to Jennifer and oh man what a breath of fresh air! The whole atmosphere of the salon was relaxed and unpretentious. Jennifer made me only feel comfortable but look awesome! She is so sweet and talented, and she gave me the best textured haircut Ive ever had! Love her.
