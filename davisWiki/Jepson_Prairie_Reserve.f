Jepson Prairie UC Nature Reserves Reserve is a wonderful example of rare vernal pools and is home to some of the least disturbed parcels of native bunch grasses left in the state. Just a 30 minute Adventures Outside of Davis adventure from Davis, its a great place for some Hiking and Backpacking hiking & Outdoor Activities outside fun. Jepson Prairie is also host to two endangered species, grassland, Lake Olcott, a couple of portopotties and some picnic tables.

The best time to visit is during the spring. Once the vernal pools have dried out, huge numbers of native flowers bloom in the depressions. Nonnative species cant survive the seasonal inundation of the pool habitat.
