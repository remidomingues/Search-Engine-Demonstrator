20080611 10:41:42 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Jeremy, and Welcome to the Wiki!  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for your recent edits... feel free to just go ahead and edit the actual entry, especially when you have updated information like on the Downtown Phone 11 entry.  You can just edit the entry itself with the stuff you know (that the phone was gone at least by Spring 2008 or something to that effect).  All the entries are written by people like you, so theres no need to attribute yourself or phrase it as a comment  you are free to change the entry itself to be more informative or correct.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091203 14:07:48 nbsp Hey, if you think youre worthy of being a town character, go ahead and make yourself a page!  Only through our users do we get more information.  I doubt you are a town character, though.  Officer Waltz is a decorated officer who chose an unusual career path for someone of his stature  as such, the community benefits.  You, however, just seem like you want to complain. Users/BrentLaabs

20091203 17:13:35 nbsp Are you a city official or otherwise somebody who works in the public eye?  If so, it would be fantastic if you would create an entry about yourself!  Police going back to the first Police Chief have entries, and all the past Mayors already have entries, so even if youre retired, feel free to create an entry about your past serving the people of Davis.  If you are or have been a law enforcement officer or other public official, thank you for your service, Im looking forward to reading about it.  The wiki documents the history of Davis as well as the current public officials of Davis, so anything you can add about past public officials is also appreciated.
