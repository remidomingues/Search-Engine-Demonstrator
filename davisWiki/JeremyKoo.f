Jeremy Koo (Class of 2011) is a Political Science and Economics major at UC Davis.  He is a nominee for Associate Justice to the ASUCD Court and is the administrator of the wiki:court:Front Page Unofficial ASUCD Court wiki.  He is still getting over his fear of clicking preview while editing pages.  He pays $123/year in ASUCD Fee ASUCD fees, mostly for a Unitrans bus pass hes not really using much this year, so he figures this entitles him to be an instigator, as Users/ChrisDietrich once called him, at meetings of the ASUCD Court and ASUCD Senate Senate.

He joined Model UN for a quarter, before realizing IR majors speak at a level above him, and has shown up at DCD from time to time.

He has personally seen Internal Affairs Commission Chairs Users/AmyHartstein, Users/MatthewShannon, and Users/PaulHarms in one place simultaneously.  The resulting ASUCD bylaw vortex nearly crippled the newborn Jack Zwald Zwald Presidency.

20091119 00:38:52 nbsp Good luck on digging up the history of the ASUCD Court.  Most of those old cases on the ASUCD Website are stuff I dredged up and digitized (at least prior to #22, from Frickes records).  You might be lucky and find more in the archives than I did, though records were pretty spotty during the era of Vicki.  She pretty much hated the court. Users/BrentLaabs
  There is some hope, at least.  One of the ASUCD Senators is in the midst of dredging through the archives, having gone to Shields to pull out the stuff from the founding of ASUCD.  Apparently, the more modern documents (1980current) are in a locked closet/cabinet in SGAO.  I imagine something like a mansized safe. Users/JeremyKoo
   Yeah, I used to have a key to that room.  Ive been through a lot of it, but its a mess, and some of it is missing.  SGAO keys unlock the room, by the way.  If you make friends with them, they should be nice enough to let you in.  Ive also looked through a lot of the stuff in Shields in the Special Collections.  Its pretty cool  though theres basically no court stuff in there, its mostly before the court.  They have a good set of past budgets (more complete than Marks archives) which can be very enlightening, though.  Special Collections also has old yearbooks you can look through.  Downstairs in Shields, theres always the archives of The Aggie  they did a pretty good job covering student government back when the Editor was on the Executive Committee!   Mark Champagne has some interesting documents to browse, too.  Users/BrentLaabs


20100213 18:37:04 nbsp You of all people (you filed an amicus brief in the matter!) should know that the court did not disqualify any candidates. Indeed, the court has no authority to disqualify candidates, as the opinion of the court stated. The court merely ruled that under the rules, the election committee had no authority to put that ticket on the ballot as the deadline was not met in time. Thus, the certification was void ab initio. Users/WilliamLewis
  Please dont assume bad faith.  Id only had the opinion in hand for a few minutes before making the changes, which was meant to be the briefest possible summary for the status of the candidates.  Im trying to summarize the opinion in full wiki:court:Case 48: Golden v ASUCD Elections Committee on the Court wiki, which I hope this case inspires folks to participate in.  But thank you for clarifying things. Users/JeremyKoo

20100220 16:22:56 nbsp Do you know why the ballot files gave the name Daniele Martin? My counting program just pulled the names from the file and I didnt even notice the mistake. Users/WilliamLewis
  Im guessing Creative Media plugged in her middle name, assuming http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/directory_results.shtml?id00484099 this is the same Jessica Martin. JeremyKoo
