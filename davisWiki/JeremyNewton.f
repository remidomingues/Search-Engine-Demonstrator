20051220 18:15:33 nbsp Just saw the info you added about the potential Stevenson Bridge closure. Im not an engineer and definitely not a bridge engineer, but Im pretty sure than once a concrete bridge becomes brittle enough to be considered structurally unsound, theres little else to do but tear it town and start all over again. It might be worthwhile to encourage the Wiki Photographers to host a shoot there to document the bridge! A wiki barbecue might be another nice memorial. Anyway, just a couple thoughts. Have a good evening! Users/AlphaDog
