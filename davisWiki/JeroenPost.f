In 2002 John started his own business, StarFix, in Utrecht, the Netherlands. In 2004 he moved with Constantia to http://maps.google.com/maps?qscheveningen+nl Scheveningen (The Hague) and continued business there.

Do you want to learn to speak German or Dutch? Contact Users/ConstantiaOomen Constantia Oomen and you learn German, or maybe even Dutch, in notime! Really, it is very cool to know a foreign language!

20120206 09:16:44 nbsp Hey Jeroen, a belated Welcome to the Wiki!  The hit counter is an interesting idea, but I cant say Im a big fan of it for the wiki.  The wikis all about being a community resource, and its focused on providing information about the topic of each page.  A hit counter feels to me like it does the opposite  it breaks away from the subject of the page to give information about the users coming to the page.  While I like your creativity in editing, Id personally rather not see hit counters popping up all over the wiki.

The other thing is that the language on the page is a bit promotional.  Understandable, since you wrote it as a business owner, but because of the wikis agreement with the IRS as a nonprofit, it actually cant be used for promotional purposes; rather, it needs to be informational in tone.  The Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page spells it out a little more clearly. Users/TomGarberson

20120210 23:21:19 nbsp Does a direct English translation for schaudenfreuda exist? Users/StevenDaubert

20120211 11:06:54 nbsp @ StevenDaubert schaudenfreuda is not a word, not Dutch, not German. There is this German word Schadenfreude, that means malicious pleasure. Why do you ask? Users/ConstantiaOomen
