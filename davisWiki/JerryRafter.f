My name is Jerroldine Rafter and I am presently a stay at home wife and mother with two small children. I live in Shingle Springs and became interested in the Church of the Divide Otterstads a few years ago when they showed up in El Dorado Hills with their http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oidoid%3A33987 hateful trucks. I found it interesting that three or four women from El Dorado Hills chased them away by getting in their faces and refused to back down. The Otterstads left that day and havent returned to El Dorado Hills. It seems they have a fear of females that speak up to them as we are supposed to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.
