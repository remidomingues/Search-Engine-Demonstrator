Son of the 32nd Governor of California, Pat Brown, Jerrys terms were that of a fiscal conservative who cut state costs and increased the states surplus significantly from Governor Reagans preceding terms.  He would use the cost cutting measures to fund the arts and early environmental initiatives.  He was opposed to the death penalty.

Among his many proposals was that California take a part in the (at that time, booming) space era.  He supported the creation of a California space academy and the launch of a communications satellite for use by the state.  This resulted in the nickname Governor Moonbeam.

The Dead Kennedys wrote one of their early songs, California Ãœber Alles, about their view of Jerry Brown as a fascist liberal.  They later released updated versions for President Reagan and Governor Schwarzenegger.
