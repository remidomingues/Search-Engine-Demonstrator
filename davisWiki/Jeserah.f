My real name is Sarah.

I love ducks and longboarding. I also highly enjoy Horses horseback riding and playing my native american flute.

Davis is pretty cool, but it sure is Odors smelly. Whyd the city have to plant mainly female ginkgo trees? The stagnant pools of rain and sprinkler water dont help either.
The trains rock my socks, and pretty much make up for the smell.

Im a Transfer Students transfer student.
