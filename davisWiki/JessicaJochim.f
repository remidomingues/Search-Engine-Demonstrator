JessicaJochim is very neat and clean and is often disappointed in her messy roommate Users/KatieWillheim.  She has an affinity for purses and french merde.  She once had a dog for ten days that she washed thoroughly.  She took it to the vet.  She took it on walks.  She even put her socks on the dogs feet and kept them up with ribbon  so pretty (DESIGN MAJOR!). Then its owner came and Jessica lost her dog.  Jessica does own a rabbit named PierrelaLapin who is cute and sometimes a little neglected but loved nonetheless.
