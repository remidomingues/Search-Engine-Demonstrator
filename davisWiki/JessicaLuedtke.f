JessicaLuedtke and family have moved to the political polar opposite of Davis. Sorry.

JessicaLuedtke wants everyone to know that theobromine, found in cocoa, has been found in clinical studies to be a more effective cough suppressant than codeine. Quality dark chocolate ideal for medicinal application can be found at many fine Davis establishments such as Davis Food CoOp and Nugget Market.

JessicaLuedtke also suggests cooking during the summer by putting a crock pot out on the porch to avoid heating up the kitchen. You can even http://pantryeats.blogspot.com/2009/04/crockpothoneywholegrainbread.html bake bread that way. Or just eat food that doesnt require cooking.

I just wanted to let you know that I loved your addition to Carfree in Davis and it inspired me to write a Love Letters to the Wiki love letter to the wiki.Thanks alot!  Users/JoRo
   Comment box added. Thank you too :)

20070405 07:48:37 nbsp Hi Jessica! I see that youre a Davisite, you contribute to the wiki, And youre an Aikidoka! Neat! do you still train? do you like Aikikai style? I live in Philly but Im coming to Davis in the fall for grad school. I train in Yoshikanstyle aikido, but our dojo has hosted joint workshops with Aikikai instructors in the area and from other places (Ikeda sensei from Colorado is one of them) and Im always interested to talk to students of styles other than my own ... how do you like it?
