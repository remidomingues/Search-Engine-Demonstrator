Describe Users/JessicaWissner here


AKA Jessica Friedman
I teach in Woodland, live in Davis, and like Yolo County a lot. The South of France, it aint. Favorite things: looking at feral cats during sunset, eating green olives from the CoOp, trolling for the plants that people throw on the street so I can recycle them into my school garden.
