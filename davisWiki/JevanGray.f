JevanGray has the surname of Gray and the given name of JevanFootNote(This is to clarify any issues arising from assumptions relating to name ordering.).


Jevan doesnt typically like writing about himself.  He was once forced to create a biographical blurb for a published paper.  As an initial exercise to get past writers block he generated the following highly boastful text:

Jevan Gray is the best guy around.  Dont worry about comparing yourself to him and coming up short... it happens to the best of us.  If you are lucky enough to even get within eyesight of Jevan you are in for a treat.  Watch as he mesmerizes us all with his awesome wiki:WikiPedia:Programming programming skills.  Or be amazed at the incredible feats he accomplishes while Climbing rock climbing. Finally enter a place of bliss as your ears detect the beautiful sounds of his Didjeridu didjeridu and eerie Tuvan wiki:WikiPedia:Throat_singing throat singing.

A more serious entry, focusing on his professional aspects, was eventually created and used for the paper:


Jevan Gray graduated from the UC Davis University of California, Davis in 2000 with a B.S. in Computer Science Computer Science and Engineering.  He then worked for the http://graphics.idav.ucdavis.edu/ Visualization and Graphics Research Group in the http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu/ Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing (CIPIC) while pursuing his M.S. in Computer Science. His research there focused in volume visualization. More specifically, using multiresolution meshes, viewdependent methods and multivariate error metrics and rendering techniques to perform visualization of large multivaritate volumetric datasets. In 2003 he earned his M.S. in Computer Science. Currently Jevan is doing freelance programming as an independent contractor.

He is totally enamored with a certain Users/AmeliaCarlson tea kettle impersonating gal and thinks shes Glossary hella rad! heart

20050223 16:00:15 nbsp Jeeeeezzzz, how did you update all those pages in like, 5 seconds?  Wowie!  My head is spinning.... Could be Bing, though. :) Users/SummerSong

20050225 18:28:03 nbsp I wanted to be the first person to reach  4294967295 edits, but you beat me to it.  You are the better man. Users/CarlMcCabe

20050226 16:40:10 nbsp me thinks youre being sarcastic in what you love about Davis. Users/AmeliaCarlson

20050301 18:49:32 nbsp Hey there! No worries about the quote. I didnt know who created the Housing Guide to begin with, otherwise I definitely would have included a name! Anyway, thanks for following up. Users/AlphaDog

20050307 11:53:53 nbsp I actually bailed on that hawk shot at the last minute.... I decided that it was so tiny, somebody else would probably want to post something better anyway. Thanks for cleaning up after me, though! Users/AlphaDog

20050320 22:36:03 nbsp heart Users/AmeliaCarlson

20050320 22:36:03 nbsp LOL... OMG. Way to take my lead with the weed links. Good Job. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050612 23:11:46 nbsp i didnt imply that Jimboys made me wait for the fun of it.  And there was one car in the parking lot when i arrived.  As I was actually there, I think I would know the situation. Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050613 01:58:06 nbsp All I said was that there was probably a real reason why they were so slow...  not just because they were being lazy or having fun making you wait.  I do find your comment informative.  Im glad you posted it... I definitely want to hear if JimBoys could be going to shit.  But so far this is the one case of exceptionally slow crappy service Ive heard of.  In your comment you mention how slow your visit was multiple times, and in your final sentence you made it sound like a long wait would be required to get some JimBoys.  For someone who understands that there was probably some valid reason behind the extra lengthy wait, you sure stressed the issue a lot.  It sounded to me like you might have been taking it personally.  Since youve now clarified, Ive revamped my comment including some more helpful info. Users/JevanGray

20050812 15:00:47 nbsp You beat me to the revert on Arlington, haha.  Sorry about that. :) Users/RussBowlus

20051225 23:59:53 nbsp I knew you were going to do that. I even changed it back and forth a few times, but in the end put in the space so you wouldnt feel forgotten. Thats important this Xmas season. Regards. Users/SteveDavison
   LOL.. thanks (:  While its still mostly a stylistic choice, Ive been changing them to one word because its generally considered the more modern term, and it is currently more prevalent on the daviswiki (I know youre singlehandedly trying to change that).  This probably has a bit to do with the fact that the templates had originally had it as website.  Most templates still do... the two exceptions were either changed by you (Templates/Radio Station Radio Station) or originally created by you (Templates/Publication Publication).  Website also appears to be the preferred term for the web at large; compare google searches for official website (about 70,500,000) vs. official web site (about 27,200,000).  Anyways... Happy Holidays! Users/JevanGray Jevan
     Yes, I too am aware of all that. I considered changing it on the Business Template way back, but didnt. The reason I went on the crusade in the beginning is simply this: Websters Dictionary said it was wrong. When I checked website vs. web site with Google I came up with a slight preference to the single word, but not 3:1 like with official. (What that means, I dont know.) Youll notice I have not reverted or changed any of your modifications back, although I have been aware of them. I do value consistency, standards, correctness so Im really trying to follow the highest official source (Webster); it has nothing to do with what might appeal to me personally. Im close to throwing in the towel in this matter that is, accepting website as official. Users/SteveDavison

20060403 22:26:25 nbsp I noticed an error on the Cow Crank page you (?) created. Since I dont have your facts, you might check them. Users/SteveDavison

20060405 22:32:00 nbsp Cool. Thanks for explaining. I appreciate it ) Users/EliseKane

20071112 18:13:54 nbsp didjeridu and eerie Tuvan throat singing??? wtf jevan? I never knew...

20080919 22:09:03 nbsp wanna climb this weekend? Users/trgraglia

20090402 22:07:47 nbsp Why are you debating surcharges on the CM entry?  Nobody has claimed they charge extra for credit cards.  It seems to be an awfully strange side topic caused by confusion.  They do have a minimum requirement, which has nothing to do with surcharges other than also involving credit cards. Users/JabberWokky
