  Jewish Quarterly was a Media print media publication through AS Papers on campus.

Our Credo Was
Jewish Quarterly aims to provide a voice for Judaism Jewish students on campus. We are a forum for capturing diverse viewpoints and highlighting the struggles, achievements and perspectives of Daviss Jewish community. Jewish Quarterly strives to inform, educate and entertain while fostering a sense of community on campus. Jewish Quarterly is published at the very least once every quarter, and accepts any submission pertaining to the Judaism Jewish community to be evaluated for publishing.

 Jewish Quarterly History
  Jewish Quarterly was established in 2001 by Lee Weissman.
  Prior to the establishment of the Jewish Quarterly, there was another Judaism Jewish Media newspaper on campus, named Koleinu (our voices).
About once a year, someone comes up with the great idea of trying to publish the Jewish Quarterly that year. If theyre lucky, they publish one issue that year. That wouldbe editor usually has a lot of trouble generating interest from writers. I have said several times, to several editors, that to generate interest in the Jewish Quarterly, you need to have a big meeting on a week night, with pizza and attract writers, throw around ideas, and make it clear that this paper is going to go somewhere. They never really got that formula down. I hope the Jewish Quarterly takes off this time.  Users/KenBloom
  Last quarter previous EditorinChief Michelle Feder organized a group meeting at Jamba Juice to discuss ideas regarding Jewish Quarterly. The meeting was funded by the Hillel House in Davis and was held on a week night. Users/KenBloom Ken Bloom, who had expressed interest in the publication as well as the meeting, was not present that night for reasons unknown.
    Maybe Im wrong about exactly how to generate interest.  Users/KenBloom
