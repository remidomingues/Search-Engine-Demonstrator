20060915 19:20:21 nbsp Jiffy Lubes in general have the widespread reputation as often destroying cars. For example, they perform many checks in addition to changing your oil. The may forget to properly reattach your air filter or crossthread caps. I have no experiance with this location. JustinCummins

20070414 20:54:51 nbsp They forgot to reattach things and damaged a part, then tried to fix it without telling me.  It took me several weeks to work through Jiffy Lube corporate to get to the owner of this Jiffy Lube.   When I told him what happened he was great and immediately resolved the issue. Users/Denise

20070815 13:38:31 nbsp The owner is a very fair man. I have dealt with him on many occasions. If his crew messes up he will see it is fixed fairly. This is the best lube place in town.Regular oil change is a must even on older cars! Users/Rod

20071029 00:05:04 nbsp They forgot to reattach a hose in my car (had to do with emissions).  The interesting thing is I just went for a simple oil change and Im befuddled as to why they would even detach that particular hose in the first place.  Sorry, but I probably will not go there again.  Users/YupYup

20071031 11:26:07 nbsp I brought in an older car with a few fluid leaks.  The power steering fluid and windshield wiper fluid were dry when I drove in.  Both fluids were on their top off list, and after they were done, they were both still bone dry.  It was obvious they didnt even look despite having it signed off on their checklist. Users/PeterAnselmo

20071208 12:15:23 nbsp I strongly discourage people from using this place.  I went there for oil change, and they lied to me to sell windshield wipers in addition, saying that their price is $7 lower than Kragens; I later found out that their price is in fact $11 higher!  Further, they replaced a small lightbulb for $7, and when I found out that the replaced lightbulb was not working, they refused to refund the cost.  I will never go back to this place.  In addition to being incapable, they are dishonest. Users/YSS

20080121 18:54:47 nbsp They forgot to reattach the air filter hose in my car and as soon as I drove off, my engine was not working at all.  Then they claimed it was not their fault because they said they never touched that part, but it is funny that the car was working fine before I came in for an oil change, but as soon as I leave, the car was not ok. And they did not refund my money.  I would not go back here again and do NOT recommend this place at all.   Users/Molly

20080401 13:07:31 nbsp The first time I took my car to this location they stole all of the change out of the center console of my car (~$4 in quarters which I needed for the toll booth, jerks!). The second time they left two bolts off of my air filter. Dont go here, Speedy Oil Change is just across town on F & Covell and they are impeccably honest and thorough. Users/KailaGlassburner

20080805 14:13:23 nbsp After reading the comments, I took my car to Jiffy Lube anyway.  Big mistake.  The irony is, I was talking to another patron as my car was being serviced, and I told him I was nervous because I had read the customer service comments made on the Wiki.  He said, Dont worry about it.  I know one of the guys working in there, and it will be fine.

A day after having my oil changed, a check engine light came on, along with a traction control light.  I checked my oil, which was full, so I took my car to the dealership.  They told me that Jiffy Lube had not reconnected a hose when they had changed my air filter.  I called Jiffy Lube, and the manager said he would give me $12.00 off my next oil change as compensation.  I just spent $120.00 on top of the $40.00 I paid for an oil change.  $12.00 is not going to do it for me.  I will be speaking with the corporate office. Users/J.E.Aimes

20080909 13:51:16 nbsp Great... I really wish I came to Davis wiki before I went to jiffy.  Now everything makes sense.

First time at Jiffy lube, everything seemed/went fine.  Second oil change, I realized that my signal lights were going a lot faster than normal.  I figured it didnt matter.  Third oil change, they tell me that the bulbs used on my lights were bad for my car and charged me $$ to get it changed even though they were the ones who put it in the first time!

The last time that I went there, all my sensors have been messed up.  First, everytime I make a sharp right turn, the lights for my doors go off.  Then the light for my brake went off.

Now, my brakes dont work.  Theyve become extremely loose and have no pressure and I have to floor the brake pedal to barely stop at the stop sign in time. Users/tk86

20081112 02:41:44 nbsp High prices.  Poor attitude.  If they need to add fluids, they charge you lots of money for it.  Low wait times when I stopped by, but you will pay dearly for the convenience.  My experiences at another local shop were much better (if slower).  I would suggest not coming here. Users/IDoNotExist

20090224 12:37:40 nbsp Out of business.  Sign in window. Users/JimStewart

20090527 14:04:52 nbsp I drove by the Jiffy Lube the other day and some guys were cleaning the place up. I asked them what was going on and they said a new owner is coming in that has all the Jiffy Lubes in Sacramento area. I checked online and their website is www.jiffylubeca.com . They guy gave me a Jiffy Lube VIP discount card and said they will be open in about a month. Hopefully the new owners are better than the last ones, we shall see! Users/mjstevensucd

20090809 20:10:03 nbsp Had an oil change and tire rotation done. I requested synthetic oil. Every operation was done with great care, the team used torque wrenches on the drain plug and lug nuts. The team made sure that the filter was not double gasketed and all the fluids were topped up the windows were cleaned and the carpets vacuumed. The manager went over everything under the hood before i left. The cost was fair and the work was done quickly. I felt welcome and was thanked for my business. ill be back! Users/zonepunk

20090903 08:53:42 nbsp Went there yesterday for an oil change for my boyfriends 91 Jeep Cherokee. The two men working there were extremely kind and got the work done fast. They also let us know about the small leaks the car had, but didnt pressure us to fix it because they were minor things that older cars have. I really appreciated this, because I hate when people try to talk me in to fixing things that I could have done else where for cheaper or do myself. They even washed the windows, topped off all of the fluids and aired up the tires for FREE. If youre tight on cash, download a $7 off coupon from their website.

Loved that they had a nice waiting room with cold water and hot coffee. You can even watch them work on your car from the room because they have cameras set up on the car racks. Users/BrookeB

20091113 15:31:43 nbsp Outstanding service from the moment I arrived! Be prepared to be shown the red carpet and treated like a celebrity. After helping you navigate your vehicle up to the garage entrance, you are escorted to their cozy waiting room where you are invited to have coffee. After a brief wait, they return to review a list of recommended services on a computer screen, which is fantastic when technical details are explained visually. If you feel like turning down any additional services, feel free because there is no pressure! If you have children, there is a new Thomas Train Table which is a plus when your 4year old is tagging along. Highly recommended, especially if you are new to the whole experience! Users/coolingunit

20091126 15:48:49 nbsp I resently went to the jiffy lube, and while i was there i was informed that this location is under new ownership and new management. I went in for an oil change and the customer service was amazing. I was not pressured to buy anything i didnt need. I was only told about my vehicles manufacture recommendations on things that were recommend for my vehicle. It was 100% my choice to buy what i wanted. I was in and out very quickly. All the employees were very nice and they did an awesome job on my car. Nothing went wrong.
The lounge is big and they have a train set for the kids. Very relaxing. My favorite part was that they have cameras all over so i can actually watch my car being worked on from all angles. Really made me feel good about having my car worked on there. I will defenetly recommend everyone try this place out! As well as i will be back for every oil change!  Users/jessica31221

20100106 17:41:21 nbsp Got an oil change there today. The upsell was annoying  $3 more to fill your coolant? $15 for an air filter, even though yours looks pretty clean?  but otherwise they did a good, quick job, as far as I can tell.  My basic oil change, four small light bulbs replaced ($10 each), and a coolant replacement came to $77 after using a $7 coupon and getting a $5 discount from the manager for buying so many light bulbs.  They seem trustworthy. Id go back. Users/DavisKing

20100202 11:38:55 nbsp This jiffy lube is the best one I have ever been too. There service was bomb! And everybody in the shop seemed like they knew what they were doing. But the old man behind the counter seemed like he didnt know anything and I was like what ever but thanks for the exceptional service you guys rock. Users/charles25

20100226 09:36:14 nbsp Yes, they have new management. Yes, theyre very nice to you when you enter their business. Yes, it was fast. However  they still manhandled my car and ripped a huge hole (about 3 inches) in my air intake hose while doing one of their stupid checks to upsell me on an airfilter (which I didnt need, because I had just replaced it recently). When I took my car back because it was shuddering and jerking back and forth when I accelerated (it had been driving perfectly well when I brought it in that morning), and asked them to fix the problem by replacing the intake hose that theyd torn or at least paying for the damage theyd caused, the manager refused to pay for it and tried to tell me it was my fault because the car was old and the parts were old. The manager, Jeff, tried to assure me that all his associates are very gentle when checking cars  I call shenanigans. I handled the same air intake hose very recently and managed not to tear it apart  Jiffy Lube, you owe me $50 for a new hose. Im never returning to this place, and I hope other people read this and avoid it as well. Also, an FYI for Jiffy Lube associates  just because Im wearing a skirt doesnt mean I dont know jack about my car; apparently, I know more about it than you all do.  Users/TheBean

20100228 00:44:03 nbsp Check it out TheBean I took my car to jiffylube and had a wonderful experience with them and if your wearing a skirt and know SOOOOO much about your car why dont you just do your oil change your self since you know more than they all do? Ive tried other places here in davis in the past and have never had such a exceptional experience as with jiffylube. Best EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!!! Users/s13dorifto

20100314 18:08:25 nbsp I love jiffy lube its the best place in Davis to get your oil changed I recommend everybody go there. And I love there coffee!! Users/charles25

20100314 18:27:34 nbsp —s13dorifto, Why are you so fired up with TheBean? Users/BruceHansen


20110213 11:06:43 nbsp LOVE IT HERE~! They have amazing customer service. We had Jeff help us and he even poured our coffee for us in the lobby while we waited. So nice!! Then, he walked us through all the standard manufacturers recommendations for our car and told us what we could wait on or what we should get while there. Which we found great because sometimes you can go to these places and they pressure you into the full package, but not Jeff. He was like.. personally I would wait on this or that, or if I were you I would get this next time you come considering how little you drive etc. He was so informative and pleasant. They even vacuumed our car for us even though it was beyond dirty (picture leaves and papers all over the floor, yes were slobby sometimes!) anyways, they were amazing. It reminded me of the scene in Back to the Future when Marty ends up in 1955 and hits the down town area and sees the full service gas station attendants pumping gas, putting air in the tires, wiping the windshields etc. It was like.. where are we that were getting such great customer service?! Very refreshing. This is THE place to take your car for oil changes in Davis! Users/Bryna

20110331 22:19:09 nbsp I had an excellent experience at Jiffy Lube.  I went in for an oil change and while they offered me the other things, they didnt try to sell me on any of them and just moved on when I said no thanks.  I had been told (at another garage) that my coolant needed to be changed so I mentioned that to them but they tested it and found that it was fine (and explained the test to me) so they saved me money and were informative.  The people were delightful, polite, and fast.  I am definitely going back there next time for an oil change. Users/Kat79

20110401 19:46:38 nbsp After a very long workweek, I wanted to get my oil changed and found a coupon for $7 off online.  I called and was told the cost of the oil change was about $37 and I could use my coupon for a discount.  As usual the employee offered a variety of additional services and I opted for the $25 TX7 engine treatment in addition to the Signature Service.  I was told I was about a quart low before service.  I was surprised when my final change was more than double the original estimate and didnt discover until reading over my receipt later I was charged an extra quart of oil($3) and double charged on the labor ($12).  They didnt clean my windows or vacuum the interior, and didnt reset my oil milage indicator light either.  Ill never go to this or any JiffyLube again.  Users/TnT

20110814 12:43:24 nbsp Never go here, they are completely unethical. First they do the usual upsell, despite my asking for only an oil change. Then the manager gets in my face because I asked them to stop disassembling my truck. But heres the cap: I just found the PCV valve they took out lying on my skid plate  they didnt even try to reinstall it from what I can tell. Terrible behavior.  Users/KenBo

20111019 04:23:27 nbsp NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. THEY ARE LIARS! I had been taking my car here for their expensive oil changes and one day I notice that my car is low on power steering fluid. So I decide to go in for their free topoff service. When my car is finally finished I drive off and guess what? Absolutely ZERO power steering fluid was added, so I had to pull over to add it myself. Then, if that were not enough, my transmission started to act funny and I discover that the tranny fluid is almost two quarts low! I had trusted Jiffy Lube to keep on top of my cars fluid levels but obviously they cant be trusted at all. Users/MarkWChang

20120215 11:07:10 nbsp The Jiffy Lube staff in Davis is very friendly, and they have a reasonably pleasant waiting room.  However, I think the business practices of the Jiffy Lube corporation itself are highly questionable.  First of all, this place is an absolute ripoff.  It costs a little over $100 after everything is accounted for to simply change the oil on my 1993 Ford Taurus.  This is something I have started doing myself for about $20 after getting tired of Jiffy Lube bleeding me dry.  Furthermore, the last time I went in there, one of the employees informed me that the timing belt on my 93 Taurus was showing wear and needed to be replaced soon (which they graciously offered to do, of course).  However, the engine in my car is an overhead valve (OHV) design, and therefore does not even have a timing belt!  So either the guy was an idiot of a mechanic, or was flatout lying to me to try and boost their business.  Also, twice after getting my oil changed, they did not reattach the air filter cover correctly, and deformed the plastic pinions that keep it in place.  Do yourself a favor and learn how to do basic maintenance on your car...these guys will charge you a fortune to do so, will halfass the job, and will probably try to sucker you into paying them for services they cannot actually offer. Users/eganio

20120601 16:38:38 nbsp Just had a great experience here. Friendly staff, very quick and very thorough. Reattached everything, and walked me through what they had done and why. Will come again.  Users/McBeeves

20130212 12:27:30 nbsp Justin is the new manager.  Hes is super hot!  I cant believe I paid $30 for new wiper blades for my new car! Fooled again by crafty salesman.  Really fast service though and really nice. Users/JenniferStanton

20140720 09:56:26 nbsp I did not like my experience here. They tried to push a lot of additional products. When I kindly declined I got some serious attitude from the employee. It was very rude and I will definitely never return again.  Users/Pintopony
