20050205 20:05:20 nbsp What year are you? Users/BryanBell

20050209 20:04:11 nbsp Oops I forgot that. Thanks. Users/JillWeinstein

20050209 22:02:17 nbsp Do you like cold cream of wheat?  or was that just oatmeal that you like cold? Users/JaimeRaba

20050210 10:36:34 nbsp I like both cold.  Cream of wheat is best when you spread it out in a brownie pan and stick it in the fridge overnight.  You can cut it into strips in the morning and eat it that way.  My moms family fries the cream of wheat for special occassions like Christmas morning. Users/JillWeinstein

20050305 16:43:11 nbsp Awesome.  See, the fact you can serve it as mush or as a solid is whats awesome about polenta/grits too.  And I always liked cream of wheat and maltomeal in the same way i liked grits.  Do you like grits too? Users/JaimeRaba

20050306 16:37:23 nbsp Jill...Im sorry, but youre just too cute. Users/StacieTownsend

20050306 18:37:26 nbsp Stacie....I look 13 in that picture. Thanks a ton.  Oh, and I was happy because of you. Users/JillWeinstein

20050602 20:44:46 nbsp Thanks Brent! Hows your ankle? Users/JillWeinstein

20050602 21:40:00 nbsp I think Jill will make an excellent commissioner on the IAC because she likes to talk, unlike others that volunteer their time to remain silent.  From what I gather Jill is filled with more knowledge than half the student body.  She likes Thai Bistro so that means she has excellent taste.  Good taste and brains are the combination only a special operations culinary agent has, whatever that is.   Users/RobertBaron

20050602 21:56:38 nbsp Can we get her placard for IAC to read Special Operations Culinary Agent? Users/BrentLaabs

20050602 22:48:00 nbsp im trying to talk to you on MSN, but failing Users/BrentLaabs

20060108 15:06:47 nbsp regarding the open hearts, open minds thing...no, I didnt know it was the methodist church slogan.  Its not the official slogan of Crossings, just the general attitude. Ill look into the copywrite useage though.  Thanks for the heads up! Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20060113 13:21:01 nbsp You might consider creating a Wiki page for the 1000 wells project, it sounds interesting. Users/SteveDavison

20060113 20:14:41 nbsp thats next on my things to do.  thanks for being interested :) Users/JillWeinstein

20060114 01:36:03 nbsp Psh... right, you avoid Food Fair unless the food happens to involve my Oreos... ;) Users/MichaelArrigo

20060114 01:37:24 nbsp Sorry. That was me. Mike was obviously the last Wiki user on my computer. Users/StacieTownsend

20060326 17:09:58 nbsp just saying hi:) Users/EricWu

20061205 23:49:57 nbsp Yeah, Kinda crazy, eh? I look forward to working with you in IAC, Jill. Users/KevinPowers

20061206 19:03:14 nbsp yay IAC Users/EricWu

20061211 17:49:04 nbsp I like the page layout :) Users/KevinPowers

20070212 23:48:59 nbsp Id argue that some of the material we deal with requires IAC to be impartial, or at least appear as such, so Id just like to thank you for not wearing your pin during meetings. I cant say the same to others. Users/MaxMikalonis
  Id argue that nothing requires IAC to be impartial any more than any other commission. It just seems the norm lately that IAC seem moreorless nonpartisan (I broke off my ties to LEAD while I was chair.)  Id say that its actually more beneficial for B&F to be nonpartisan, though.  Unfortunately, before Irina, that wasnt usually the case.
   Yeah, It may be more beneficial for B&F to be impartial because they deal with the budget, but I do feel its important for both of those commissions to be less partisan. IAC exists to try to improve ASUCD/its Bylaws, and while there are differing opinions as to what Improve is, most people would agree that better written legislation and clearer bylaws are good things to have, no matter what side you are on (Unless its Lloyds). And, your accomplishments in IAC arent going to be what you run on for ASUCD Senate (Unless you passed the pledge bill), instead youd focus on your external event commission position you held for one quarter.
   The internal structure of ASUCD has very little to do with LEAD vs. Focus.  As I am not chair of the commission, but simply an unpaid volunteer, I feel that its appropriate to express my opinions for the upcoming election as someone who more or less knows whats going on.  I feel extremely strongly that Kareem and Julie should be our next Prez and VP, Ive made that known publicly on many occasions.  Ive been affiliated with three different slates in the past...so its a pretty fluid thing for me.

20070216 17:48:06 nbsp You can Jive with that! I felt like I was in a time warp to 1972. Users/KevinPowers

20071011 00:19:59 nbsp I think this page needs to be updated, dont you? Users/MaxMikalonis

20071011 09:15:18 nbsp Nice meeting you! Users/WilliamLewis

20071127 21:12:22 nbsp Mexico under the PRI is ridiculously interesting to study. Users/DanXie
