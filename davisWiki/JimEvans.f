20071113 23:32:40 nbsp selling wares, especially hand made ones, is not evidence of not being hippie. Picnic day is also subsidized over $20,000 every year, where as, WEF gets no university money. why you gotta be a hater... Users/PxlAted

20071114 08:45:51 nbsp To avoid being a hater, I left out the part about the people not smelling very good at WEF. Dont you get the feeling that many of vendors are hippies because thats their market? Users/JimEvans

20071114 08:54:44 nbsp Actually, I found it an amusing point to make.  I have no idea what the intent of it was, but fits the light surface contradiction qualification for humor.  And yes, I just phrased it that way.  In other words: Its funny.  Laugh.  http://cheshirehall.net/link/ws/wink.png Users/JabberWokky

20071114 10:15:16 nbsp Im glad WEF gets no university money  I agree with you. Its not comparable to the magnitude of picnic day by nearly any means, no matter how much people wish it was or feel more deeply connected to it or are hippies <.<  Tons of vendors selling overpriced junk, big whoop. And the part about peoples smells, LOL!   Users/EdWins

20071114 14:27:56 nbsp Way to base your opinions on vague feelings and not on actual experience. I know several vendors and have talked with many more, none of whom seemed in it for the money (it being wildlife conservation, anarchism, weird bikes, antiwar etc. etc.). There are so many informational and educational booths and free activities at WEF. One year I showed kids how to do political spraypaint stencils in the Art and Revolution space. Maybe thats the smell you were refering to. Sorry about that, next time Ill use a spray box.  I like some of the music at Picnic Day and I like some of the music at WEF so I go to both.  I still think youre hating without actually knowing, which makes me sad because WEF tries to be such a positive, non comercial, non corporate, zero waste, FREE event.  Users/PxlAted

As far as actually knowing, I have been to or around (I work on campus) WEF 5 to 7 times and Picnic Day as many. You right I dont know the vendors. But, how is someone selling crazy hats or didjeridus advancing environmental causes? I wasnt knocking informational or educational booths, but you cant move around the Quad during WEF because it is packed with vendors. Its unpleasant. Users/JimEvans

20071115 03:54:56 nbsp   Please see {{{Town Wildlife/Talk}}}  I started a formal discussion (well, formal for the wiki) about renaming the animal entries. Users/JabberWokky

20071213 20:49:00 nbsp Depends on if youre going by folk taxonomy or scientific... thats a horrible and viciously debated split.  You should see the rabid arguments among rodent breeders.  Next thing you know people will be saying that deer mice arent mice.  ;)  Ah, peros, how seldom people defend your right to distinct classification, while the lago question gets all the spotlight.
