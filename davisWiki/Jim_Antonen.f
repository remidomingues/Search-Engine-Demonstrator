Jim Antonen was the City Manager until the end of January 2006.  According to http://davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/02/02/news/334new1.txt an article in the Davis Enterprise, he resigned at the request of the City Council.

20060202 18:22:05 nbsp Oh, please.  I dont think the City Council is going to convene an emergency meeting to fire their City Manager, whom it took 18 months to hire, just for offering funding for a student project.  Users/GrahamFreeman

20060202 21:55:29 nbsp So is the city in bad shape or something? Or is this one of those personalindiscretions firings? Users/ApolloStumpy

20060202 23:06:40 nbsp This guy resigns and gets severance pay? When do we get to hear the real story? Users/PaulThober

20060203 01:05:34 nbsp I dont know what the real story is.  All I know is what the Davis Enterprises http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_source gossipcolumnposingasanarticle said, plus the Citys press release.  But its quite common for executive departures to involve severance pay, and to involve the use of the term resignation in public even when the term involuntary termination is used in private.  Nobody wants to admit they were fired, and people in management positions often have enough money and ego to make it smarter for the employer to allow them to call it a resignation.  Since the confidentiality of personnel issues is generally protected by law, we may never know the real story.  My bet is on several years of subpar performance, but thats just speculation.  I do know that you dont fire someone in whom you invested the better part of a million dollars unless theres a very good reason. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060208 12:17:55 nbsp This is not an issue with subpar performance.  The City Staff are shielded from Council action regarding personnel issues.  They can only be hired and fired by the City Manager.  If the Council is unhappy, they can only take action by firing the City Manager. Users/SharlaDaly
