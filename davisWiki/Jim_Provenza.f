    Im the one who wrote that comment. I dont know what other explanation there would be for no skid marks except for his eyes to not be on the road. I hope the police subpoena his cell phone company. He was thisclose to hitting her drivers side door instead of the passenger door behind her, and he could have killed her. Users/MeggoWaffle
