Jimboys was a Mexican restaurant that has several locations in the Sacramento region. It was fast Mexican food, which made for an option for folks who live on west Davis that side of town.  Employees at this Jimboys (who apparently also worked there when it was a Blimpie) reported that they have quite a few more customers.  They also had a drivethrough.

One of the most notable characteristics of Jimboys Tacos is that they have Parmesan cheese on the outside of them.

Before the block was remodeled, there use to be a Jimboys where El Mariachi currently sits, and the current Jimboys replaced a Blimpie and Taco Bell.

Their coupon were in the Consumers Guide.


This has potential, but for now Guad and Adalbertos will suffice for me.  Grilled corn tortillas on tacos are very oily, and dumping dry cheese on the outside only makes it impossible to blot the oil off. Most burritos are fried. Their latest commercials profess that all their options are Atkinsfriendly and have been low carb for over 20 years.  Or something.Users/JaimeRaba jr
  Lowcarb is highfat. Anything but healthful. Users/SteveDavison
    Strange... I have a friend in Sacramento who is a vegetarian and is on lowcarb.  I wouldnt call her diet very high fat. Users/JabberWokky

20050120 14:23:06 nbsp FYI, the dry cheese is Parmesan, and its somewhat of a trademark feature for them. The story is that Jim accidently spilled some Parmesan cheese when cooking some tacos. After cooking new tacos for the customers, Jim ate the spoiled tacos for his lunch. He was so impressed with the taste they have been adding the Parmesan ever since. For whatever reason, Jimboys has thrived in the Sacramento area... there being close to 30 locations locally. Users/JevanGray

20050129 15:39:21 nbsp Yeah, well, I think really oily tortillas are their trademark feature. But yeah, its definitely Parmesan. Users/JaimeRaba

20050129 15:39:21 nbsp Mmmmmmmm. Youre not a true Italian until you use an entire can of Parmesan cheese on one plate of pasta. Oh God, Yum. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050612 20:28:36 nbsp I am eating this as I type.  Very very good in taste, perhaps a tab bit oily.  People working in their were very rude though and the guy at the drivethru window practically shoved my food at me, without saying anything to me.  I think I sat in the drivethru line for 15 minutes waiting for my food and it wasnt busy.  Everyone behind me in the drivethru turned off their engines and were impatiently tapping their steering wheels.  Slow but good, but I dunno if its worth waiting 15 minutes in the drivethru. Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050612 20:30:42 nbsp I have gone through the drivethru many times and never had the whole ordeal take more than a few minutes myself (though I have had pretty rude service on occasion). It sounds like your experience was exceptional. A 15 minute wait is not typically required in order to enjoy JimBoys goodness (it is fast food). You can also order JimBoys from inside the store. Then you have the advantage of picking from the salsa bar and you can also see what theyre actually doing if they ever take so damn long again. Users/JevanGray

20050612 23:15:57 nbsp I never said they made me wait for pure fun. The car in front of me also waited about 10 minutes for their food. And as I was actually at Jimboys/Unocal this evening, the place with empty with one car getting gas and another (presumably the owners car as it was parked on the far side of the lot) car in the whole parking lot.  I gave a review of MY experience. You have your experiences and I have mine. Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050616 13:19:07 nbsp Ok went there for a second time to see if the bad service was a fluke. They were friendly this time. I bought the ground beef quesadilla and a chicken taco and put the bag on my passenger seat thinking that the foil wrapper and box inside the bag would be enough to keep oil at bay.  Well I got out of my car and noticed a huge orange oil stain on my seats. The bottom of the bag was completely soaked thru with orange oil. I opened up the quesadilla and inside was the oiliest ground beef I have ever eaten. It took 1.5 sheets of paper towels to degrease the inside of the quesadilla. Again, the chicken tacos were awesome, but I think I will need a quadruple bypass after the quesadilla. Hence ground beef is not recommended. Users/AshleyOrsaba

20051206 15:45:24 nbsp The food here is just weird, and the fact that it is consistently voted as the best burrito in Sacramento proves that Sacramentans have no clue what a real burrito should taste like. Users/DudeNude
  I think the vote choices are 1) Jiffy Lube, 2) DWR, 3) Jimboys Tacos. Users/SteveDavison

20051207 21:30:09 nbsp I love Mexican food, even fakey fastfood Mexican food, so Ive been dying to try Jimboys... I finally did. OH GOD! I think the Parmesan cheese on the outside of my taco was bad, cuz it smelled like POOP and FARM ANIMALS. I kid you not. I asked several people who agreed with me  it stank. I tried to get used to it, but kept gagging it. I threw it out. The enchilada was ok though. Mediocre. But Im never going there again. Users/AubreyJohnson

20051208 06:59:23 nbsp Seriously Aubrey this place will make you sick! It has to be the most disgusting abortion I have ever consumed. Users/DudeNude

20051208 11:23:16 nbsp The cheese quesadilla gave me the first stomach ache id had since i was seven years old.  i was prompted to look up appendicitis when i got home, just to make sure it was the food. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051212 17:54:45 nbsp I believe the 76 station is actually Mass Enterprises dealer #252197 (according to the cash reg. receipt) confirm? Users/SteveDavison

20060812 09:23:13 nbsp Everything Ive eaten there is very oily, and the parmesan cheese on the outside of the tacos is nasnas. Users/CameronMenezes

20060813 12:29:55 nbsp I think critics are forgetting...its gas station drivethru food, handed to you through a little window while youre sitting in your car with the engine running and your foot on the brake.  To me, the food tastes good, its filling, its different than McDonalds/Burger King/JackintheBox and its cheap.  Ive never had to wait longer than any other drivethru place in this area, and when I smile at the employees, they smile back. Users/DukeMcAdow

20060814 08:50:50 nbsp I havent eaten at the Davis Jimboys, but I have eaten at the Woodland one, and since they are a local chain, I assume the food is similar.  The tacos are pretty tasty, as are the burritos, but if youre not used to eating a lot of grease, stay away from this place.  This place has perhaps the greasiest fastfood Ive ever eaten.

20061105 16:46:37 nbsp tacos are good, the parmesan cheese is nice, BUT i had a burrito the next time, tortilla was dry, they forgot the rice, beans were like bean paste soup. it was like someone barfed into a tortilla Users/TheStomach

20070329 13:23:36 nbsp It appears the Jimboys in Woodland is now closed.  There wasnt any notice posted, but place was empty and there were no trespassing signs up on the sides. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070329 13:51:30 nbsp Yes, the woodland location is closed now.....tear....I used to get lunch there frequently.  I find the food a step up from TacoBell, in every sense. Users/RocksandDirt

20070329 20:32:15 nbsp The Woodland location never seemed to catch on. It wasnt in a great location...right next to McDonalds and a stonesthrow from a halfdozen or so momandpop Mexican restaurants. Users/DukeMcAdow

20070329 23:34:16 nbsp I have to say I have in the past noticed a huge difference in quality from GasStation based food and the actual taco stands they have in sac.  Its ok, Id still rater take the extra 5 minutes to get off my ass and walk into an actual taqueria for tacos.  Even the dirtiest taqueria produces better tacos and such than these places.  Dont get me wrong I still eat at these places but it is just to get full, not to really enjoy the meal.  Convience is a bitch   Users/JarrettNoble

20070330 19:10:02 nbsp I ate at the Woodland location a lot and enjoyed it.  The 2 times Ive been to the Davis location I was totally let down.  Too bad the Woodland one shut down. Users/BradBenedict

20070517 14:04:03 nbsp the coupons that come in the mail for buy one get one free burrito always entice me, but theits smart to just stay away. itll put a hole in your stomach. not good food. Users/RossTownsend

20070517 15:16:48 nbsp I ate here once and the drivethru was quick. I have eaten at many Jimboys in the Sacramento area, and each one is very different depending on the cook. The one is West Sac on Harbor Blvd and West Capitol is better than any Ive tried. You do have to be patient at that drivethru because they do cook everything after you order. I do tend to stick to local taquerias now. Guadalajara Taqueria in  South Davis is excellent.  Users/TenayaFreitas

20070722 18:30:47 nbsp Pretty cheap and they give you a fair amount but I didnt much care for the taste. Bleh. Users/AlexandraDeGrange

20080616 23:31:45 nbsp Stopped by Jimboys on my way home tonight.  Its cheap and totally fills you up.  Their food is way too oily, though. Now, Im not one of these people who only eats vegan nondairy, either.  Im not afraid of greasy, arteryclogging food.  Dont mind getting my hands dirty.  I love eating crap, but their tacos and burritos are extremely oilyeven for me.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080710 13:42:42 nbsp Oddly enough, the Yolo County Health Department does not recognize that there is a http://www.decadeonline.com/main.phtml?agencyYOL Jimboys in Davis. maybe they dont actually sell food... Users/JoePomidor

20081210 23:30:44 nbsp They were permanently shut down when I went there a couple days ago.  Users/StephanieRobinson
