Jimmy Pan is a UCD alumni who works in some sort of UCD lab. Im not really sure.

He likes to work out, play Infantry, learn about and discuss politics and other social issues, spend time with his girlfriend Jane, and do community service for his fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega.

He is very friendly but has a few eccentric preferences for conversation topics...
