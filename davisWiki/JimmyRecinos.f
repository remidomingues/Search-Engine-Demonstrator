20140206 14:08:41 nbsp Hey, Jimmy  I noticed your edit to the Community Alert.  Somebody else removed it because that tends to be a place for things like urgent police requests and critical issues to the community like water boil orders.  You might want to make an entry about Aggie Voices by Aggie Voices clicking here and hitting Edit, and after it is fully written with enough information to be an interesting read, make it a Featured Page.  If you have any questions, just ask... its a community effort here on the wiki.  Welcome to the Wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845
