Jimmy Moresco is a Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Senate Candidates candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate on the Student Focus slate.

 Candidate Statement 

Whats up Davis?  My names JIMMY MORESCO and Im running for ASUCD Senate on the sweet STUDENT FOCUS slate.  Im a second year and am currently in limbo between majors right now.  You might ask Well, what qualifications do you have?  Well let me tell you:
  I served on ASUCD Executive Staff
  Im a member of the Davis College Republicans
  And to top it all off, Im the Scholarship Chair for Sigma Phi Epsilon

Now you may be saying Alright, you may have the qualifications, but what do you plan on doing?  If Im elected to Senate, I would do everything and anything within my power to:
  Get a business major and minor on campus, because lets face it, it makes no sense that we dont already have one
  Create an ASUCD Publicity Committee, that way next time big acts like Dave Chappelle comes to Davis, you will know about it before the day of the show

Stay classy UC Davis, and dont forget to vote for JIMMY MORESCO and STUDENT FOCUS on November 16 and 17 at http://elections.ucdavis.edu/ elections.ucdavis.edu.
