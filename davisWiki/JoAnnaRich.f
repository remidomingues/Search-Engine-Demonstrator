I graduated from Davis and no longer live nearby to try out all the restaurants.  Everything below is from my time in Davis, Sept 2003  August 2007.  Appreciate the DavisWiki; I wish more cities would have their own with an active community.



I love to promote diversity and native languages so please feel free to change the names of the restaurants here on my page!

  Manila Restaurant in Elk Grove  (3) 8 pages Chinese and 2 pages Filipino (as in the language); Need more Filipino and Pilipino food (Because they serve Americanize food (Filipino) and not the traditional Pilipino food), pricy for small quantity
  Tahoe Joe in Vacaville  (5) Excellent.  Delicious food for a good price and excellent service.  I love their wood steaks and root beer.
  BJs Restaurant and Brewery in Vacaville  (4) You get the quality for a good price.  I was just sad that they didnt have any root beer.  And the pizookie is scrumptous.
  Nations in Vacaville  (5) Nations has never let me down.  I grew up with Nations and I love coming here.  They cook your food when you order it, the portions are huge, and the pies are the best.
  Zacharys Pizza in Berkeley  (3) OK but definately not worth driving down to have some.  Sucks they dont take credit card.  But for the quality, the price is fine.  Does not compare at all to Chicago.



We both feel very strongly on this issue.  My edits to your page were over the top, intended to make a point, but they went way too far after the point was made.  My sincere apologies.  Users/JabberWokky

I like how you have some of the restaurant names listed in their native characters on this page along with the English words.  The restaurants page should be donethis way as well.  Unfortunately, I tried to use Chinese characters (&#20013;&#25991;), but the wiki headline macro wont display them correctly; it just shows the escape sequences (& #20013; & #25991;).   Users/CarlMcCabe CM this should work now.

I like the native language efforts, too.  Were too isolated in the U.S. Users/GrahamFreeman

Too bad no local restaurants serve Roman food... oh well, scratch another thing off the list of Things Latin Speakers Cant Translate. Users/CindySperry

According to their website, Jamba Juices name derives from the African word jama, meaning to celebrate. Thats nice of them to be multicultural and stuff, but last time I checked African wasnt a language. I did a bit of digging and they say elsewhere its swahili. Jama typed into a http://africanlanguages.com/kdp/index.php?len swahili dictionary translates to family or companions, so I cant corroborate their story. Interestingly, Jamba translates to fart. Im certain its syntacticly wrong, but above Ive haphazardly (mis)translated Jamba Juice to muta fart mnywo, where Jamba is fart, and juice is muta mnywo (sweet drink). Users/CraigBrozinsky

20060517 01:04:15 nbsp Hi JoAnna, I love this page! I have eaten at every restaurant in Davis, but never really had the energy to build a page about it.  Users/ChrisLambertus

20060701 18:42:21 nbsp They didnt have root beer or they were out of it?  BJs brew their own root beer  its delicious.  Maybe they were just out of the batch?  And I know its also on the desert menu as a float.  Users/EdWins ES
  They were out of the root beer ( Well I did end up going like an hour before they closed.  JR

20060829 00:57:13 nbsp what about Village Bakery? i recommend asking for pesto + tomato sauce :) Users/EmilyFrançais Frenchie

20060917 16:09:01 nbsp Im glad to see so many Horchata recommendations. My plan for the next few years: find the best horchata in Davis. Users/MoTorres

20061007 10:22:59 nbsp The problem is that he was messing around with his bio page, which isnt his. His personal page is his baby. His bio page (as a public figure) belongs to the community. Users/WilliamLewis

20070126 13:25:23 nbsp I love this page ) Oh and if you go the other way (opposite Vacaville) you get to Folsom, which also has a BJs Users/TusharRawat

20070129 02:23:49 nbsp you need to eat at the educated eatery once Users/StevenDaubert

20070222 10:42:03 nbsp i love this page.  It inspired me to create my own a while back.  I wish everyone would do something similar.  Its fun to see how people rank different restaurants.  I especially litke the native characters Users/MattHh

20070302 00:03:16 nbsp Hey Joanna come and visit my restaurant in Woodland.  We serve Japanese and Hawaiian Food.  Our address is 10 N East St.  Email me at rtaura@yahoo.com and I will send you a menu. Users/RobertTaura

20070302 09:44:04 nbsp Hey, JoAnna, youre very good at being sensitive to pigeonholing by race.  Im trying to avoid that in Ethnic and Cultural Organizations.  Do you have any thoughts on how not to lay it out so divisively but at the same time indexed for people looking for a particular group? Users/JabberWokky

20070302 10:08:29 nbsp JoAnna  see Ethnic and Cultural Organizations.  Theres a centralization going on, not deletion.  Your content was also moved to Demographics as well. Users/JabberWokky

20070302 11:35:26 nbsp Thanks for the comment JoAnna.  Certainly if a page exists, it shouldnt be deleted without some sort of discussion about its importance, as long as it is not blatant spam of course.  I was mainy trying to curb the continuous deleting and reviving of some pages that was going on.  Most of those thoughts could have been hashed out in a talk page before action was taken.  My comments werent directed at you specifically, just the situation in general.  Thanks. Users/DavidGrundler

20070302 12:06:31 nbsp I am going to be away for the weekend so I dont have much time to do edits, but if possible can u find some ASA and NAS people intersted in the wiki to add to the South Asian and Native American pages? Users/EricWu

20070302 12:33:24 nbsp I feel almost like the edit confirmation: Thank you for your attention to detail:)  Users/EricWu

20070302 12:46:44 nbsp JoAnna, you dont need to be so paranoid about people deleting the Mixed Race entry.  Its okay, were all in this together.  It actually hurts me that youd think anyone would be against you in this.  Were all working together to try and add more information.  Content was moved around, but nothing you ever wrote was ever deleted.  Its put me in an odd mood that youd think I (or anyone here on the wiki) would even consider silencing your voice.  This morning was about balancing and figuring out where to locate types of information, not silencing people or groups.  Fantastic entry, by the way.  You might want to even split out Mixed Race Issues at UC Davis in terms of scholorships and demographics... thats why I moved some of your earlier content to the Demographics entry, because it illustrates how poorly they cover some people. Id still like your feedback on how best to organize Ethnic and Cultural Organizations so they dont exclude or minimize multicultural groups and organizations while still having a structure allowing people to look up various groups.  Users/JabberWokky

20070302 14:47:51 nbsp Youre right... I started jumping around and moving stuff around without explaining first and giving you a chance to agree or disagree with the edits.  Please give Ethnic and Cultural Organizations/Talk a read to see what I was trying to do. Users/JabberWokky

20070420 09:22:12 nbsp the pilipino/filipino debate is opening up again on the restaurants page. do you remember where the original discussion of the issue came up, so we can link there and avoid future revert wars? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070508 18:29:41 nbsp 20070508 11:28:39 nbsp Just ask them at la crepe to cook it on the third griddle or second griddle a bit longer and they will for sure. Users/StevenDaubert P.S. have you been by Icekrimski cafe ? Try the gelato and tell me how it stacks up to cold stone!

20070524 18:57:23 nbsp Awesome catch on Aggie Barbershop! http://cheshirehall.net/link/ws/smile.png  It is not like it is in an obscure corner of town, either. Users/JabberWokky

20070524 23:13:18 nbsp aggie barber shop alreayd exists, pretty sure Users/StevenDaubert

20070525 02:00:00 nbsp The aggie barber shop ? Users/StevenDaubert
PS The aggie barbershop  aggie barbershop {{{<}}} there is the difference, I dont go around deleting pages without a reason, perhaps you should look closer at recent changes edit comments, and your question would have answered itself D ...  P.P.S you still need to go to the educated eatery
   JoAnna is right  I thought it already existed too, so I did a search and it didnt come up.  I would have made the same duplication error.  Its because the search has been acting up for a couple weeks.  I know Philip has been working on fixing it, but it looks like there are still problems left. Users/JabberWokky
      I do not think this was a bug.  I searched for barber shop and found the result immediately.  Im guessing you searched for the single word barbershop.
       I searched for the aggie barber shop and found it instantly, I know this cause I had to link it to carriers carpet & floor care a couple days ago because he is one who cleans the store and I was the one setting up the wiki page for it, and this was of course  before the redirect, but the redirect is fine.  Users/StevenDaubert
         Ah, yes... not a bug in search.  A bug in the user.  I did do a search for Aggie Barbershop.  Regardless, it comes up under both now.  Not a biggie.  jw

20070704 13:26:34 nbsp Ive seen a few changes you made, like in fluffy donuts.  It seems that you rephrased things that were very well written but could possibly be misconstrued by sensitive people that are offended by raindrops and replaced it with colorless descriptive narration.  I think their is a vast canyon of difference between stylistic differences and the factually erroneous  with only one needing modification.  And please dont pass wikipedia guidelines as some sort of rebuke  because they are to writing as the DMV is to driving. Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20081019 09:00:07 nbsp you should give the putah creek cafe a shot next time your headed outside of Davis Westbound... Users/StevenDaubert

20081026 22:14:41 nbsp It probably would have been impossible to try every restaurant anyway, since the latest ones have seemed to to appeared and disappeared within a matter of months.  Users/ElleWeber
