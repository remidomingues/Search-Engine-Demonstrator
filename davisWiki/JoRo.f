Office: I finally got sucked into the UCD vortex.

Heres my story Been living Carfree in Davis carfree in Davis since moving here in 2000. Frequently seen at the Davis Food Coop Coop, catching up with friends at the Saturday Davis Farmers Market, and cursing newbie bikers who havent gotten around to reading the Bicycling Tips page.

Evangelism: Given any chance at all, I will eagerly evangelize about:
allergy shots
the Coop
pee wee avocados
japanese shiki futons (or sleeping on the floor in general)
swilling very hot water to combat intolerable spiciness
the Great Lakes
linguistic evidentiality

20110328 21:07:33 nbsp hi there Jo, was wondering if you can edit the Pow Wow announcement on the Events Page. Id like to write more info about it and add a picture. I am a member of the Native American Student Union and help put on the Pow Wow. Thanks for much for posting it! The time is 10am. Pow Wow is from 10am10pm. So maybe can edit the time and add the photo from the ccc website thats been uploaded.  Users/alcatraz

20110329 16:45:29 nbsp thanks for doin that, for sure want people to know its gunna be all day long. :) here is a link for the powwow flyer: http://oi51.tinypic.com/2j26d0x.jpg you can edit that one in. Other than that simplicity is good for the announcement. Not too sure the specifics for the DQU Gathering, but its been traditional to have the UCD Powwow and the DQU Powwow following, happy its like that for this year.
Peace Users/alcatraz
