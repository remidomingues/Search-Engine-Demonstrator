It is easy to get swept away in the busyness of life and drift from that which is truly meaningful and important to us.  When stress and unplanned events happen, we sometimes lose our balance.  In my work with women, teens, couples, and children, we celebrate each persons strengths allowing a more adaptive way of handling whatever comes your way.   It is a journey of the heart to really know yourself and your strengths.


 Davis offers a wide variety of Counseling and Psychological Services.
