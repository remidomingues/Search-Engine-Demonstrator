Im Joan McDermott. I moved from Connecticut to Davis in 2008.

While in Connecticut I worked in the mental health field as a Licensed Professional Counselor specializing in addictions counseling, integrative psychotherapy and bereavement counseling. For many years I have helped people recover and heal from their grief. I have always found it an honor and a privilege to become a part of anothers healing process.

I love living in Davis and am excited to be helping others through Life Coaching. It is a profession that allows me to combine my expertise and passion in moving people forward and bring healing to broken hearts and spirits.
