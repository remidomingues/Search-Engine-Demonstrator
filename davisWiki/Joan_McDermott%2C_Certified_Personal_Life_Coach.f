Whether recovering from an addiction, losing a loved one or any other type of loss, we experience a grieving period. For many years I have helped people recover and heal from their grief.

My long history of people skills can be seen in my professional credits which include: Licensed Professional Counselor, Integrative Psychotherapist, Master Addictions Counselor, Teacher, Child Care Worker, College Academic Adviser, Spiritual Director and Grief Counselor.

These different skill sets may be integrated, if needed, in the process of Personal Life Coaching. It is always an honor and a privilege to become part of anothers healing and lifeenhancing process.
