Joan Randall, long time resident of Davis, was President of the Board at the Davis Food Coop.

She was the first Yolo County resident to have been infected with the West Nile virus. She discovered her infection in July 2005, at the age of 60, after donating blood to Blood Source. The news of the infection came during a time when the West Nile virus was having a booming year, even necessitating http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/ongoing/west_nile/story/13392672p14234112c.html the aerial spraying of some Northern Californian counties.

On http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/ongoing/west_nile/story/13465292p14306324c.html August 23, 2005, a Hippies hippie crowd  took over a Davis city meeting run by Mayor Ruth Asmundson and a panel of experts. Randall took over chairing the meeting and, according to reports, ran it smoothly, although, after the panel of experts had left, there were many nice words spoken but no answers to the questions.  Happy and ineffectual.  Yay.  See Mosquitoes.
