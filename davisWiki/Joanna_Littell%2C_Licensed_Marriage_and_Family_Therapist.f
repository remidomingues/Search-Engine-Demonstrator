The foundation of Joannas Counseling and Psychological Services counseling and therapy practice is based on the belief that each person has the internal resources needed to address problems that might stem from unhealthy or traumatic experiences, maladaptive coping habits and/or irrational thoughts. Joanna utilizes therapeutic techniques that fit her clientsâ€™ unique internal resources, personality types, and core concerns. Her overriding goals include client safety, long lasting positive change, and greater life satisfaction. http://joannalittellmft.com/contact/ Contact Joanna if you have additional questions or would like to schedule an appointment.
