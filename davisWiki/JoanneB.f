 About Joanne 
My name is Joanne, but most people call me Jo.
I am a grad student finishing my Masters degree in Textiles and Clothing
My Bachelors degree is in International Agricultural Development.
I came as a freshman and never left.
I have worked at several places around town, many might recognize me from Ninas Studio or Cafe Bernardo or maybe youve heard my voice when you call village cab
I have helped teach several classes on campus including: TXC 6, TXC 174, and TXC 290.
To say the least, I am well experienced at Life in Davis

Some of my favorite Davis pasttimes:
     My first day of school Getting dropped off at the dorms, meeting my roommate for the first time
      Discovering the arboretum I am from Chico, so this is the closest thing I get to Bidwell Park (my favorite park ever!)
      Picnic Day The day the Davis acts like Chico (but with class, of course)
      Living in the apartment above the former Roxies
      Good Ol Dukes Sports Bar & Grill My liver might not ever heal
      Farmers Market A Davis cornerstone, especially for those living downtown without a car
      Davis food Coop Another Davis staple, Best selection of local Microbrews in the area
      Participating in the Undergraduate Research Conference and promoting my work on KDRT
      Getting into Grad School Amazing opportunities to present my research locally, nationally and internationally

Current Ventures
As  most grad students will agree, my research consumes most of my life. I am currently working on a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project on Medical Textiles. It is a multidisciplinary project that incorporates the chemical, economic, and social structures/relationships between reusable and disposable medical textiles. More specifically, my thesis looks at the diffusion of fabric technology through the medical supply system and potential barriers to adoption... just to summarize in three sentences ;)

I will be working around the Textiles and Clothing department for the rest of the school year, helping students, finishing up research and building new bridges. Its sad to think that the department might potentially be closing, but the textiles industry will thrive on. The TXC dept has so much to offer the School of Agriculture that it is unfortunate that the current budget crisis can drive institutions to make such harsh decisions. http://theaggie.org/article/amidplanstorestructuretextilesandclothingdepartmentflourishes

A group of Davis Alumni, including myself, have started a NPO called Project S.A.S.S. (Skiers and Snowboarders for Sustainability), We are launching this winter and are looking for people interested in getting involved or offering support. http://www.facebook.com/pages/ProjectSASS/180499239118?vinfo&refts... More info to come!

Recently, I have been working off of referrals for Business Consulting. I have helped several local businesses build and develop their social media networks (i.e. Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, etc) and help teach them how to represent themselves on the DavisWiki. If you might be interested in my help, please email me at sustainablesolutionsconsulting@gmail.com


20100120 20:40:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Im curious to know how you explain Davis Wiki to your clients. Do you use any of the information on Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner? How should that page be improved? What do you think of the recently developed Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions For Profit Restrictions? What advice would you give to Users/Bizarro given the recent http://daviswiki.org/Bizarro_World/Talk?actionrecall&version219 discussion? Users/JasonAller
   Wow, thats all really interesting. I am still reading up on those links and I look forward to contributing to those discussions, but I do have a few questions regarding whats allowed on my page. Am I allowed to offer my assistance to other local businesses on fixing their page? I dont really considered myself a business because so far, all my clients are friends or friendsoffriends who have approached me because they dont think their wiki page captures the information they want to highlight. I have a standard procedure of meeting them (bringing a copy of their wikipage) and discussing with them facetoface on how they want to represent their business and what information they feel is important for consumers to know. I always show them a draft before I post and I make any changes they want. Previously, I would post under their usernames, but I have recently discovered the Importance of using your RealName giving myself credit for my editing skills. I have previously used the username Users/curlycueJEB or using the business owners account, but just made this account recently.
    You mention offering your assistance to other local businesses on fixing their page  I hope you understand that the page describing a business does not belong to that business.  Rather, it is a resource for the community, cowritten by members of the community from the perspective of the community, and not meant to be promotional.  So, anyone can edit it, including you and people associated with the business, but keep in mind that any edits you make may be changed by other members of the community.  And if they are overly adlike, they probably will be.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100120 21:02:52 nbsp Just had to say hello to a fellow Chicoan living in Davis.  I can totally relate to your comment about missing Bidwell Park (the arboretum is a decent substitute when I need a fix), and it got me thinking.  If youre ever waxing nostalgic for home, Check out Davis Wikis sister site wiki:chico Chico Wiki.  Ive been quite involved in trying to get it going, but weve been slower to get the community built and need all the input we can get.  Wed love the help from a local if you have anything to share.  At the very least Id recommend checking it out for the nostalgia factor alone.  Thats what got me sucked in a couple of years ago. Users/StaceyEllis

20100223 15:03:04 nbsp Same message I left you on Azure Ds/Talk: Hey, I edited on the best knowledge I had, but it certainly seems you know more about it than I.  :)  I think I have the general outline of what occurred, but Im not positive if she was using the name before she opened the spa in the Anderson Bank building and if she still uses it now (or if she goes more by her own name).  Theres no question that Azure Ds should point to her, as the wiki tries to document history and where people go from and to in town (hey, its a small town, and you often want to find that person you really liked wound up!).  Read through the changes I made, feel free to fix anything I got wrong, and if you need any big structural changes moving things around, Id be happy to help.  Just let me know whats correct, and Ill zip through and fix it up. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
