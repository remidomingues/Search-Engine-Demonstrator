20090201 20:57:20 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. Ask if you have questions. Some things like the use of AT and DOT in {{{MailTo(}}}} macros have reasons. Users/JasonAller

20090201 21:16:23 nbsp Jason, thank you for your welcome.  You certainly are a quick responder!

I do understand that the very nature of wiki is so that the community is active in all the sites.  I welcome comments and suggestions.  I have worked very hard over the last year to get my advertising statement to say just what I want, and it was that which I was addressing.  Things like changing bullet points to asterisks are matters of visual aesthetics, and do not really bother me. I am more requesting that visitors do not change the actual content without at least contacting me first.  I believe that I was respectful in doing so.

I am assuming the at and dot is to prevent bots from flooding my email with junk, and I appreciate that.  But I have a good spam filter, and would like to make contacting me as easy as possible for potential clients.

Thanks again for you input, I do appreciate that someone is looking at my entry!  ^_^ Users/JocelynPerea
