My names Jodi and I go to UC Berkeley, where I am majoring in anthropology.  My boyfriend of 2+ years, Davey Reed, goes to Davis and I love him very much! Consequently, I am often found in Davis, which has become a third home for me.  

Im a Dogs dog person at heart, but somehow I have ended up with two cats, and I love them both very much.  

Mr. Pickles (a.k.a. Pickle Sticks, Pickle Cheese, Catenka, Catenka the White Russian, etc.) is my child, for all intensive purposes.  Ive had Pickles since he was 3 months old.  He is a white, mediumcoat, stumpy Manx (although there is a possiblity that he is an American Bobtail).  Basically, his tail is short.  He is also absolutely insane.

My other, newer cat, is Ember Rose.  Full name: Sweet November (no I didnt name her).  She goes by Ember, or Emur de Lemur.  Pickles doesnt know if he loves her or hates her, so they either spend their time sleeping in a ball together, cleaning one another, or trying to kill one another. She is way more sensitive than Pickles, she likes cuddling and she actually purrs.  Its crazy.  She is a tricolor tabby, meaning she is orange/silver/brown.  One of her legs is entirely orange, but you cant see that in the picture.  More to come of her!

And of course, my dog Auggie (Augus P. Downey, Jr. Esquireess).
