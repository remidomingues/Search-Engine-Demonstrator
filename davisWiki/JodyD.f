Hey Jody.. Im out on my wedding anniversary night, but if nobody else does, I can help you tomorrow morning.  Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110611 21:29:19 nbsp Hi Jody, and welcome to the wiki!  I converted the PDF to a JPG and put the specials menu up on the Red88 page.  You or someone else may be able to place it better, but at least its up there now. Users/CovertProfessor

20110614 17:08:46 nbsp Thanks a lot, to both of you! I really appreciate it, if at some point you could point me in the direction of a thread that shows a new wiki user like myself how to complete this (on my own) I wont have to bother you again.
Thank you again,
Jody Users/JodyD

20110614 21:01:50 nbsp Jody, its no bother!  But its also great that you want to learn more about wiki editing.  There is a page called Help with images that can tell you about how to arrange a picture on the page once it has been uploaded.  For example, you can make the picture stay on the right or on the left, or thumbnail it to make it look smaller, allowing other wiki readers to click on it to see the larger version.  However, the page does not tell you how to convert from a PDF to a JPG  that is something that you have to do on your computer before you upload the picture.  I am a Mac user, and I use a program called GraphicConverter to do that.  I am sure that there is a Windows equivalent.  ;)  Do a web search for convert PDF to JPG and something will probably turn up. Users/CovertProfessor
