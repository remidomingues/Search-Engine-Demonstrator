Are there any members who can give me free advice on why my Nikon N2000 shutter stopped working? It could be something simple and I feel a bit foolish but its better to ask then to stay ignorant. Thanks  Joe Cattarin


Joe, if youre interested in Photography, you should check out the Photography Club meeting on Wednesday. Welcome to the Wiki!Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051107 11:59:51 nbsp Stop by the photo club tomorrow (5pm or so at Cafe Roma by campus) and we can take a guess..  Looking at the cameras specifications, I am guessing that it is the cameras internal battery.  The shutter is electronic on your camera, despite the fact it may seem very nonelectronic!  Does the light meter work?  Stop by Ritz Camera and ask them for a new battery and see if it helps. Users/PhilipNeustrom
