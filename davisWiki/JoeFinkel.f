Joe Finkel was born in Davis in 1980. He has lived in Santa Clara County, New jersey, and Dublin Ireland, among other places. He came back to Davis a couple years ago to form the Playboy Millionaires with Users/JaiziAbedania Jaizi and Users/GriffinWalker Griffin.

He worked at Ink Monkey Graphics, was a DJ at KDVS, and lived at the Pirate Ship

Joe with a shirt on is sort of like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster: elusive.

He moved to NJ in the first days of 2006.center(end)
