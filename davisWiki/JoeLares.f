Yeah, this is me.  I go by Chico.  Mainly because Im from wiki:Chico.  Im in the Aggie Band, and I live with Users/SamSellers, Users/TaylorMoseley and Tiger at 1222 Pole Line Road Pole Line.  I enjoy drinking beer from our kegerator, and play beer pong.


Sweet Battle page edits, Chico.  I had to fix the original 2006 entry, because someone had written that the Aggie Band lost to Stanfurd!!  Clearly that could not stand. Also the historical stuff makes it really classy.  Way to go.   Users/AllisonEriksen

PS: Slide whistles are fun.
