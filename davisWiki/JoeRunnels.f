Joe never much liked living in Davis, mostly because of all of the close minded liberalism, and so has moved back to the bay area...

Joe pretty much fucking rocks, and thats pretty much all you need to know!

He is smart as hell. He is very modest about his intelligence and down plays it to feel like he belongs. He is also a smart ass...

Joe is shy and outgoing, a contradiction perhaps but him nonetheless. Pretty girls intimidate Joe. He drives fast and lives faster, Joe likes working on cars. He loves his salt water fish tanks. Joe is making his dreams come true everyday, are you?

He grew up in the East Bay Area, and moved up to Students Davis for school, moved around Sac for about a year and is now back in Davis.  So much nicer than Sac.

OH YEAH!  I almost forgot!  I also collect quarters!
