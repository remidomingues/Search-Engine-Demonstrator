As you know, I am passionate about sustainable fiscal and environmental systems, the value of education, the need to both celebrate and respect our differences, and the imperative to address climate change through clean energy and improved transportation systems.  I am exceptionally proud of our accomplishments in Davis during these recent and trying economic times.
 Through my day job at UC Davis’ Institute of Transportation Studies and Energy Efficiency Center I am privileged to work with some of the state’s most innovative minds, and I know I can continue to translate our collective expertise into effective policy.  I would relish the opportunity to bring these experiences to the California Assembly…
