Platform Issues:

STUDENT ADVOCATE PROGRAM

UC Davis students who encounter trouble with professors and university officials have no place to turn to for advice. Other universities offer support services for students in need of representation.

I will establish a Student Advocate Program  a nonpartisan group of students which will offer representation, help, and advice to any student or student group involved in a dispute with the University.

The Student Advocates would provide assistance for a broad variety of problems, including conduct violations, grade disputes, enrollment issues, financial aid problems, establishment of residency, discrimination, and harassment. All assistance would be free and confidential!

CULTIVATE STUDENT HOUSING AND ASUCD CONNECTIONS

Resident Advisors are the first point of contact with first year students, so informing them about ASUCD, resource centers and student services throughout campus would allow first year students a smoother transition into the University.

Help enhance the Resident Advisor training by allotting more time for them to get acquainted with resources and services throughout campus.

ACCESSIBILITY TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Work with the Financial Aid Office to increase the number of phone lines, window hours and information accessible online.

Push for live chatting options through the Financial Aid website and more diligent training of student staff to maximize services.

ADVOCATE FOR HIV TESTING ON CAMPUS

Due to budget cuts, anonymous HIV testing funding was reduced and is not guaranteed to continue beyond this academic year. Anonymous HIV testing locations are necessary for awareness and information to reach students on this campus.

Work towards allowing anonymous HIV testing to continue at UC Davis and continue to advocate and educate students about the risks associated with the virus.
