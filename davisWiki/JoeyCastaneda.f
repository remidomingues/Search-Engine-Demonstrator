Joey is a currently a third year here at Davis double majoring in Music Department music and communications.  Hes a flute performance major and has been playing the flute for 10 years now, and is studying the mentorship of Tod Brody.  Joey has also been an RA for the past 2 years working in the Segundo Housing area, hes enjoyed his experience, but is THRILLED to be living off campus next year.  Having become really accustomed to Davis, Joey is still a SoCal boy at heart.  Born in West Covina and lived in East LA, Joeys hometown is Rialto, CA (halfway from LA to Palm Springs).  To avoid the Davis rain and gloomy weather Joey loves to go to shows at the Mondavi Center, eat out (usually Plutos or Nugget The Nugget), or just chill and have a couple of drinks with close friends.
