Im currently enrolled in the UCD Community and Regional Development Community Development masters program. Ive owned a small software development company for the last 15 years (http://www.pointnclick.com), and while Ive enjoyed it because it had the good fortune of doing my hobby for a living, Im now ready for the next thing. The UCD Community Development program will be the second major step in changing my work from my software development, to doing economic development work in the third world.
