20091220 22:52:07 nbsp It looks like William deleted the page you were creating. Take a moment to look at Recent Changes and see his comment and then consider discussing it. Users/JasonAller

20091220 22:54:58 nbsp There is nothing on the page you created for Alex Lloyd that suggests he is a public figure in any way. You cant just create pages for friends on here. If he is indeed a public figure, please write about why we should care who he is.

Additionally, why are you posting his phone number? Its apparently unlisted. Rude thing to do. Users/WilliamLewis

20091221 00:06:21 nbsp The people you see on People are editors on Davis Wiki. Editors can create short little pages to tell the wiki about themselves. Note that they are all in the Users/ namespace. For example, this page here is at Users/JohnDavis. If you wish, you can write a bit about yourself here. My page is at Users/WilliamLewis Users/WilliamLewis. These arent random pages people created for their friends.

20100101 21:00:33 nbsp You uploaded pictures to the Alex Lloyd page that you cannot possibly license under the creative commons attribution license. They were removed before for this reason and you restored them.

Also, you still havent justified that Alex is a bona fide public figure and the page isnt simply vanity. Users/WilliamLewis

20100102 08:50:54 nbsp Hey, John.  William isnt being a hardass, its simply that the stuff on the wiki has to be free for everybody to use.  Its kind of one of the reasons the wiki works... everybody contributes, everybody can use stuff without ever worrying about being accused of ripping somebody off.  The other issue hes talking about is that most people have editor entries... like this one for you.  Only really well known or people important to Davis  the mayor (and past mayors, other politicians), musicians who regularly perform, KDVS DJs, people who have published a book, etc.  have entries written about them.  And even they dont usually write their own entries, as other people write the entry about them.  Its not their entry, its an entry about them, which is a kind of important difference.  Its kind of subtle, so no worries if its confusing at first; were all trying to help you out, so if you have any questions, just ask  were a friendly community here on the wiki.  :)  Welcome!
