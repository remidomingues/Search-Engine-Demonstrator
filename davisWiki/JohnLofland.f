Hey, thanks very much for your writing on potholes.  I never knew that there was a misunderstanding with a reporter!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

Thanks for fixing up Davis Historical Society, I thought the text about the website was kind of weird, not saying very much about the society itself. Since there is already more material on Davis History / Davis Historical Society should Davis Historical Society go away or what? There really shouldnt be two pages for the Davis Historical Society. Users/NickSchmalenberger

Hi Philip Neustrom, yes, I am also inclined to think the new page on the DHS alone is not needed. I have not checked it, but it would be good for the Davis History / Davis Historical Society page to come up when one searches on davis historical society.

Thanks for your work. JohnLofland

  Can these two pages be deleted? An alternative is to copy the entire table into either Google spreadsheets or Excel. This allows you to sort, graph, pivot table and analyze the data in many ways including sorting by name.

20080625 21:11:17 nbsp Have you seen the year pages like 1956 and 1928? The entire timeline section of the wiki is being reworked and I know that you have a lot knowledge about local history. Maybe you could help flesh out a few of the weaker years? Id love to get a page going about the Womans Christian Temperance Union and some of the other topics that you covered in Davis Radical Changes, Deep Constants. Users/JasonAller
