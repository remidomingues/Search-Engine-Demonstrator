Hi John, welcome to the wiki!  I just wanted to let you know that weve got a Copyrights policy on the wiki which prohibits us from uploading stuff we didnt make ourselves (for the most part) but lets other people use our work (the notice is right under the Save changes button).  See the Copyrights page for some more details.  This little note is because of your TakoyakiMonster cookie monster picture ) Users/PhilipNeustrom 20050830 18:25:49
