20080203 08:49:38 nbsp How about putting those comments back and including the following after them: {{{(Note this user only has made this single comment)}}}? That way it gives the benefit of the doubt that maybe the business has a computer there and is asking customers to leave comments on the wiki. Im not totally cool with that as Id prefer that they just give out the URL and let people discover the wiki and leave comments while not being watched by the person that they are about... but it is one possible explanation that shouldnt invalidate their comments.

20090103 18:12:43 nbsp Can you tell me what your price dealing was with Honda, was it easy difficult, how much did you start with asking below and how much did they drop? How long were you there and were you buying a used or new car? Did you walk away and then they offered you a better price. I have been to the Edmunds website and read up a little about dealing with the car dealerships, but personal experience is always a plus in my book.  Users/ElizabethBarthel
