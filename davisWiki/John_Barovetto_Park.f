John Barovetto Park is located in Mace Ranch at the corner of Alhambra Drive and Arroyo Avenue.

This park is named after a local hero John Barovetto, whose name was also a candidate for the Korematsu Elementary School.  The local residents actually voted for the park to be named Egret Fields after the beatiful egret that inhabited the field for 23 years before the park was constructed.  The Davis City Council instead decided to name it after John Barovetto to honor him since the Board Of Education chose the to name the local school after wiki:WikiPedia:Korematsu Fred T. Korematsu instead.

Target is supposed to donate $10,000 toward this park as part of the agreement between the City of Davis and Target but it is unclear how this money will be spent since the park is already constructed.

20101213 13:05:05 nbsp Another nice Davis park with bike path access.  The dog area is not fenced in and there can be a lot of small children nearby so its best to come when its less crowded.  Your dog may be friendly but small children may not understand that!  I did have one issue today with a man bringing a dog onleash to the dog area.  Initially his dog was ignored (common courtesy dictates that you do not allow your dogs to approach until a person makes it clear that they intend to bring their dog to the offleash area).  He continued into the area with his dog, then became angry and yelled when one dog approached to say hi and his dog growled and lunged.  I think his exact comment was, If you cant control your dog, keep it onleash (along with some other stuff).  Note that this happened entirely within the clearly marked boundary of the offleash area and actual dog interaction lasted maybe 2 seconds.  Luckily people like him are few and far between in Davis and I hope to have more positive experiences. It is a very pretty area. Users/themichelle
