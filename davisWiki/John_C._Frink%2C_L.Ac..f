20101020 00:10:59 nbsp Today I experienced acupuncture for the first time. I was fortunate enough to be seen by John Frink who is, an instantly likable guy that exudes positive vibes. From the moment I stepped into his office to the moment my treatment ended, I felt very comfortable with my surroundings and with John. He did everything in his power to make sure I was as comfortable as possible and he excelled. The treatment itself was very enjoyable and I reached a very deep state of relaxation which I think was helped by the relaxing ambient music he had playing in the background as well as the overall vibe of the room. I left feeling extremely happy with my time spent with John and I will without a shadow of a doubt, return for some more acupuncture! I would recommend him to anyone and everyone! Couldnt be happier :) Users/RobertKennedy

I had a really wonderful experience being treated by John Frink, L.Ac. A really great acupuncturist! He really helped my TMJ to improve. I had a really loud popping when I would chew on my left side and he made it go away with the acupuncture treatment (only took two visits). He really has a very caring disposition toward his patients and really looks at not just treating the condition the patient is suffering from but also treating and improving the entire health of the whole body. It really works, and you feel more energy and revitalized after every visit. I would definitely recommend him as an acupuncturist!!! Users/MichelleAFisher

John Frink is an exceptional accupuncturist.  It was my first time going in and I was a bit nervous.  I have a bit of a needle phobia.  John knew that and was very understanding.  He constantly made sure I was comfortable and that I was doing okay.  It was completely painless.  At one point, I forgot the needles were there.  He made me feel completely relaxed and put me at ease.  I told him I was a new mother and the areas I needed relief in.  When I left, I felt the best I had ever felt.  I felt as if I had a complete good night sleep and I was only there for twenty minutes.  I highly recommend him to anyone who wants to try accupuncture or has already done it.  John is very professional and understanding.  He retains a level of modesty not easily found.  Massage is great, but you are left feeling greasy from all the lotions and oils.  John uses accupuncture to make you feel as good as a massage, but without all the hassle of getting one.  I felt better after a session with John than I did at any massage.  People should definitely check him out. Users/JosinaFriedrich
