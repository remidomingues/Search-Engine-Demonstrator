John Draper (born 1 Jan. 1917; died 4 Feb. 1992, Santa Rosa, CA) was an elementary instrumental music teacher in the Davis schools from 1952 until about 1983.  One thing he is remembered for was that his classroom for several years was a bus that he drove to each school.

He was a conscientious objector during World War II, when he served more than two years of alternative service.  He graduated from San Jose State College, and played French horn as his primary instrument.  He directed the choir of the Davis Community Church for ten years and participated in a number of musical groups, including the University Symphony Orchestra UCD Symphony Orchestra and the Sacramento Philharmonic.  He was committed causes of peace and social justice.

Draper was the 1989 recipient of the Harmony in Our Lives Award.
