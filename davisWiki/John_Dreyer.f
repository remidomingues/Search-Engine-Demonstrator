John Dreyer was a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2007 ASUCD Election running on the GO slate.  He failed to win office.

Earlier during Fall quarter, John was found in the dormitories campaigning. His case was sent to Student Judicial Affairs, and has likely been resolved at this point. (although it would remain private no matter what is decided). He was allegedly found in the dorms again while the polls were open.

Note update

Thank you to everyone involved in this election.  I learned more about people and society in one quarter than I had in all previous years of match/science classes.



 Candidate Statement 

I am a fourth year Premed Exercise Biology major with a minor in Chicana/Chicano Studies. I have been on the deans list, have been an active participant in the Greek community for the last 3 years.  I amuse myself with languages, speaking English, Japanese and Spanish. My mother is full Japanese and my father is German/South African. Id like to think that I am an interesting breed.

Growing up in two simultaneous cultures, I cant help but show the utmost interest in cultural and worlddiversity issues. I was born in a little town called Spokane, Washington. At age 1 I moved to Kyoto, Japan, and I lived there for 7 years. At age 7, I hopped around the States in 1 and 2 year spurts including: Sausalito,CA, Chicago, IL, Portland, OR, Monterey, CA and now Davis, CA.

Throughout my life, I have been soaking in, both consciously and subconsciously, the manner in which human beings act, think and interact amongst each other on a global scale. This has helped to develop an interest in global and national politics.  I recently started to appreciate the little bubble that we know as Davis, Ca.  It is a unique city.  There is only one Davis in the world.  I want to contribute in some way toward the smooth functioning of a city so precious.  I figured student politics was one way to do this, and having known several past senators personally, I felt inclined to run, despite my atypical field of study within the student body crowd.  I am a human biology major surrounded by an overwhelming crowd of political science, communication and international relation majors.  I do not mind being that odd one out.  Anyone who has great hope and ambition is always subject to public criticism.

I want to use my outside perspective, as well as opinions from the student body, to help make decisions and changes within ASUCD for the betterment of its individuals.  I just want to be a voice for the people. I realize that respect is hard to come by, having been raised in a culture that puts respect above all other priorities in life.  I think I can earn your respect.
