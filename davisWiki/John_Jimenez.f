20070918 14:06:12 nbsp Mr. Jimenez spent an hour helping me figure out how to fight a stupid UCDPD ticket late on a Friday afternoon, and didnâ€™t charge a thing.  If I had needed to go to court with him, he offered to do it for $200, versus the $750 that two other law firms asked. Apparently he also specializes in defending students who are in trouble with UC Davis Student Judicial Affairs (SJA). I wish I had had him on my side when SJA tried to trample all over my civil rights way back. Nice guy and down to earth, and exceptionally competent. Users/JohnS
