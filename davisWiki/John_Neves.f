Officer John Neves is a Davis Police Department Davis Police officer who usually can be found downtown on a bike. After retiring from the police department, he now works as a parttime officer.  Dont try and argue with him as he is chock full of one / two liners that make you feel like a moron. But he is a good guy, and has your best interest and safety at heart. During the crush of freshmen new students each fall, he works extended hours and will flag down people by the group as they wantonly commit moving violations on their bicycles bikes.

20090302 20:20:22 nbsp Nice officer; got pulled over by him on Friday night for not having a light, and he was really professional and nice about it. Users/AlexChiang

20090620 13:10:52 nbsp Officer Neves is great! he is really friendly and doesnt harass me and my friends for sitting at the park like a lot of cops do.  Users/aro4474

20090811 21:36:04 nbsp Neves is a bitch who is harassing every biker in town. He should be sent home watching for his grandkids. Users/rvas69

20090812 08:35:50 nbsp He did tell a story about a girl he pulled over for running a stop sign.  When asked if she knew why he pulled her over, she responded Because youre an asshole!  Needless to say, she received a ticket instead of his usual warning.  I love Officer Neves. Users/BrettHall

20091013 14:04:14 nbsp Hes definitely senile. Pulled my friend over twice in two weeks for no bike light. Didnt remember him the second time. Users/JoshSmith
  Pulled over twice in two weeks for no bike light you say. And this makes him senile?  LOL

20100315 23:36:39 nbsp Officer Neves is one of the nicest people you can meet in town. Ive had numerous conversations with him and seen him in action many times downtown. One incident that stands out for me is the time a man was stopped on his 10speed for running the stop sign at 3rd and F. He began to yell and argue but Officer Neves just calmly looked at him and said Im trying to help you not get a ticket here, you want continue to stop me from doing that or just try to listen for a second?  After that the man calmed down, listened and went away no harm and no foul. How many officers you know that would do that? Users/WesOne

20100710 18:15:31 nbsp Neves is wonderful. I was homeless here for about a year and he never harassed me. (Though I dont drink or do stupid things in public, so maybe thats why, but I did hang out with the stupid hobos.) Hes never pulled me over for anything, knowing I was homeless. Most cops do BECAUSE you dont have a place to live. Also, I was having trouble finding Mobile Connections a few months back and he pointed me in the right direction. (I was a block across on the same street, bad vision ftl.)  Users/Mogitha

20110120 18:27:46 nbsp Although Mr. Neves may seem nice some of the time he really doesnt have your best interest at heart.  Not only have i been stopped by him for such moving violations as following a car through a stop sign on my bike, riding without a helmet the day before my 18th birthday, or simply sitting on my bike on the sidewalk, I have also witnessed, on numerous occasions the blatant idiocy he calls police work.  Just because you know a rule doesnt mean you should tell it to every person in every single situation.  This man is a generalizer, and if you do something safe that he can tell you a rule to counter, than he wins.  Ill agree, there is no arguing with this man, hes too old and too stubborn to listen to anyone he pulls over.  Tickets should be written to people who either dont understand or threaten both public and/or individual safety.  Following a car through a stop sign doesnt endanger anyone if you are a compotent, receptive person looking to see what that particular situation entails.  Although, he will give you a ticket every time because you didnt stop.  Even though it wastes everyones time at the intersection to do so.  I understand rules.  However, i also understand a thing or two about discretion and when things are situationally appropriate.  Context doesnt matter to Neves...if there is a rule that he can tell you, he most certainly will.  Not even to mention the fact that he is very condescending and patronizing.  Please retire fully, and stop harassing people that have lived here longer than you have. Users/LukeSlotton
  Really, Luke....youre breaking a law and youre upset.  Please....hes doing his job. I suppose you havent tried to talk to his superior??? PeteB
  I gotta agree with Pete on this one.  Stop sign means stop.  Id love to see every biker who runs stop signs get ticketed day in and day out.  I hate driving along the east side of campus and downtown because there are an insane number of idiot bikers.  I also hate biking around there, because if theres another bike behind you, you risk an accident by gasp stopping at a stop sign.  Ive literally had someone yell hey, watch out, asshole at me for stopping at a stop sign on my bike, as he swerved around me and whizzed through the intersection.  Sorry, zero sympathy on the stop sign front. Users/TomGarberson
  Police discretion to one person can seem to be racism to another.   I think thats why there is little of it today.  users/jimstewart
  Luke, you are wrong on so many levels.  John is one of the most understanding officers Ive ever dealt with.  He tends to write up warnings rather than tickets.  He usually only issues tickets if you smart off to him or show no signs of respect. users/Aaron.Curtin

20110707 14:07:17 nbsp John is probably the REALEST cop in Davis. Hes the only one i feel comfortable calling him a Peace Officer. All what it takes to be on his good side is respect. It is his job to enforce laws, he is a real cop after all, as it is Officer Talaveras job to harass and distort laws. Users/JustinYoder
