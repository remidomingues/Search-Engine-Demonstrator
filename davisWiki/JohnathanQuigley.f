Johnathan Quigley was a rashly chosen pseudonym for a quick DavisWiki post. XI like it, and Im sticking with it.X I created a new account, which after some issues with trying to use spaces and underscores ended up being... almost... like my real name Users/AndreWaymire.

My real name is Drew, and while I am an out of state student, I have adopted Davis as my community (that is, when Im not stuck south of the main campus poking animals with sharp metal objects.)

Wait, these things are always written in third person, arent they?

Well Drew has switched to third person now, and he hopes the change isnt disconcerting. Anyway, Drew is an Odd Fellows pledge, and would like to share the progressive attitude of the Davis Odd Fellows with lodges in other communities when he is forced to leave Davis for his job search. For those who dont know, the Odd Fellows... ah screw it Odd Fellows here.


20090609 01:54:01 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Johnathan, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  I answered your question on the PetCo entry... its not as simple as you might think.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090809 11:11:27 nbsp Wish burger is a reference to wiki:wikipedia:Rubber Biscuit, which was a massive cult hit due to wiki:wikipedia:Dan Aykroyd Dan Aykroyds performance of it as wiki:wikipedia:Elwood Blues.   The song is a lament about not having enough money for food, and going hungry.  The majority of the lyrics are nonsensical vocal sounds, with one of the four actual lines being: Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich? A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich where you have two slices of bread and you   hum hum hum hum  wish you had some meat! Users/JabberWokky

20100127 10:58:33 nbsp I hate to pile on you, but you really shouldnt just unilaterally change the featured page to feature something youre stumping on. Discussion is needed. Also, you should try to write in the future present. Text should be just as natural to read now as it will be in 5 years. Users/WilliamLewis

20100127 11:30:15 nbsp As a complete aside (since I havent even looked at the new feature you wrote up yet):  Not 2600 enough for me is quite an amusing joke, if you know what 2600 is (the club, magazine and associated political efforts).  I have a feeling the comment had nothing to do with you or the new writeup, as they are public and it was more humor than an actual comment on the revert.  It was just a funny thing to say when restoring the payphone project writeup. Users/JabberWokky

20100127 11:50:47 nbsp See, now youre throwing around insults, calling people geeks.  Not everybody considers geek a positive stereotype, particularly older folk who predate when it was cool.  I replied on the Talk Page (actually, I replied twice, as I was confused and thought you were trying to add the comedy show at first read through, so I added a separator line to split your comment from the following writeup).  It sounds like a good idea, and as I browse through, I see youve already added a bunch.  I see no reason as to why it was reverted, so Ill cast my vote by readding it. Users/JabberWokky

20100127 11:59:58 nbsp You know, Im just trying to help you out.  Im not sure what ticked you off, but if you ask a public question, which you did, or comment in public, which you did, please dont complain at the person who takes the time and effort to answer your question and reply to your comment. Users/JabberWokky

20100127 12:02:19 nbsp Im having problems finding the Montessori Country Day Care Center, and before I created a new entry for it, I wanted to be sure it wasnt listed under a different name on the schools entry.  Is it missing from the list, or does it go by a different name there? Users/JabberWokky

20100127 21:25:29 nbsp Hey, no worries.  Everybody has days where they get their quills up.  Especially in written communication where you have to read emotion into what was said, and sometimes interpret it way off from how it was intended.  If people couldnt forgive, wed quickly run out of people who hadnt offended us (intentionally or though miscommunication) yet. Users/JabberWokky

20100320 07:07:36 nbsp Hey, Im busy, so if my edit comment on that revert isnt clear, let me know.  And lame is a Davis Wiki editor interm for edits that move entries away from their subject, reduce the content or lessen the local relevance (the latter of which I used it for).  There was a push awhile back to search for lame pages  as in a lame horse  and make them better or figure out if they were simply beyond the scope of local relevance. Users/JabberWokky
