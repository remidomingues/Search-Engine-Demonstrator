20100220 23:08:15 nbsp Hello, and welcome to the Wiki! Some of the users here are more religious when it comes to using your Importance of Using Your RealName real name while others are not as much so. There are some users like Users/CovertProfessor who have become respected members of the community without the use of a real name by providing useful contributions to the Wiki. Anyway, I hope you did not feel too unwelcome from not using your real name. Users/hankim
