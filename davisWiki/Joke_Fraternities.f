Weve heard of some pretty strange fraternity/sorority names around here. Usually their name is an acronym for something, or spells something out when you read the names of the Greek Alphabet Greek letters.  Some of them exist only on gag fliers, others are active social groups.  Who knows, in 20 years, they might be spread throughout campuses across the world.  Or wind up being recycling recycled.


  I Eta Pi, created by Rachel Zissel and friends there was a flyer in the Aggie dispenser outside of 1100 Social Science for the longest time.  Actually this sorority, though tongueincheek, does have active members and events, and even regular exchanges with real fraternities.   For instance, on 20070120, they officially hosted an 80s party.
