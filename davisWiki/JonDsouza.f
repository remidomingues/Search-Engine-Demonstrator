I am JONDSOUZA, aparently im kind of a society person. I have a penchant for Bjork and all things strange. I have been told I dress well, I beg to differ. Im an artist and a writer, though I have been in a bit of a lull lately. Im in the process of writing a Gender studies book, and a graphic novel based on all of the fun times here. I design my own clothes, when I can. Recently I have been making Clear Vinyl stuff. I wish I was born in the 70s punk era New York / London. I wish I lived in Seattle or London. I dream, what I dream becomes reality. I like boys and girls, I like boys better. I speak my mind. My mind is dirty. Ive been told Im aggressive, curt and blatant wheni speak. I get respect for that. Sasha shasha is my doggie, I call her stinkypants.

Jon was going to run for ASUCD Senate on the Friends Urging Campus Kindness slate in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election but was eliminated from canadicy on a technicality where his acadamic standing was affected by a grade which was retroactivly changed. However, the change was not soon enough to make him eligible to run for senate.
