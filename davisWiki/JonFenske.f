Im amazed Ive been in Davis so long. I didnt plan it that way. But like John Lennon said Life is what happens, when youre busy making other plans.  Anyway, this town has really grown on me.  The more I go to that sprawling suburb that is Sacramento County, the more I appreciate a town where the locals actually have a grasp of municipal planning.

I work as a Civil Engineer downtown; Ive also taught Physics and Astronomy at Sacramento City College Sac City, played guitar at G Street Pub The G St Pub. Now, I live in west Davis .  I am also a past coowner of the Varsity Theatre.   I sold my half December 2009.

I saw the comment you made over at University Airport a few months ago and I wonder if you have had any problems since then. There are some pretty strict noise abatement policies in place at the airport, and though it is requested for pilots to abide by them, it is not mandatory, and sometimes people do stupid stuff. Cal Aggie Flying Farmers We do the best we can (i.e. avoid flying over the houses north of Russell Blvd. even though the runway is just south of it) but as it is a public airport, anyone can fly in and those who arent familiar with the airport or the area may not know to avoid certain areas. I hope things have been going better for you since then!  Users/JenniferCook
