Jon Li has been involved in Davis life since 1966 when he came to UC Davis as a freshman with his bicycles bicycle.

Davis City Council Race, 2010
Jon was running for a seat on the Davis City Council on a platform of forward thinking action.
The primary efforts were in council communication and long range problem solving:
 for better communication strategies for the council within itself, with staff, and with members of the public,
the city council should implement a policy governance evaluation of it roles, including regular council
meeting evaluation by a council member at the end of the meeting, and
 implement a Viable Systems Model analysis of the Davis community, and invite people to do a
Personal VSM analysis and then a VSM analysis of their neighborhood, and their business.

Where will Davis be 10 years from now?  Where will the University be?  What about the State of California?
The VSM analysis can help   being able to respond to significant changes in our environment.

20100321 09:29:40 nbsp Hey Jon... you might want to add to your public entry at Jon Li, add a photo, etc.  Note that that entry is a community written profile about you as a public figure, so it is a cooperative editing project, not a personal soapbox.  However, youre more than encouraged to add to it.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100518 17:00:00 nbsp Hey Jon, theres currently a talk page over at VSM by Jon Li/Talk thats broached the topic of some of the articles youve contributed to the wiki, and how they integrate into the wiki.  The following is a repost of a comment from October, left by by BrentLaabs.  I agree with him, and I think a few other editors might as well, based at least on that specific talk page.

      You might be confused. Why would I delete your content on the wiki? Ive had good interactions with you in the past, and I dont want to ruin that. However, the pages youre adding to the wiki have a couple of problems:
 1. A lot of the material isnt related to Davis, the mission of this wiki. It may be tangentially related, but the connection isnt made.
 2. Youre making a wiki:wiki:WalledGarden Walled Garden. The pages dont relate to the rest of the wiki, and arent linked in or out from any appropriate wiki pages. Theyre often so long, that an ordinary user couldnt see how it fits.
 3. The wiki is not personal webhosting, even if youre using the userspace (Users/JonLi/ ...). You can use it to describe yourself, and have a little extra content just for fun, but theyre mainly there to help build a sense of community among wiki users.
So, what can you do? Your pages are definitely educational in nature, and could find a home on another Wiki Spot wiki (such as wiki:californiaconstitution). Or otherwise, try to summarize, and work your content into appropriate pages (Bicycling, Town History, Sustainability). There, youll be able to interact with other editors (who normally avoid personal userspace), and maybe help to promote your ideas and information.
Let me know if you have any question or concerns! Users/BrentLaabs
  Jon, you really could be a poster child for walled gardens: so many pages, with so few links or relationships to anything else in Davis. Its kind of sad... Users/DougWalter
Brent had suggested that you move your articles off of the DavisWiki, and I have to agree, for exactly the three reasons he listed above.  I really encourage you to have them on a different WikiSpot wiki, or else to a personal webhost.  You could then alter the links listed above to their new address.  Cheers, users/edwins ES

20100521 10:48:40 nbsp Hey Jon, just leaving a comment to make sure you see the last one.  Users/EdWins

20100521 10:50:39 nbsp The best City Council candidate you never heard of! Users/EdwardNiemand

20110425 23:13:45 nbsp Howdy! None of your new pages seem to be actually related to Davis in any meaningful sense. The pages could just as easily be on the Picher OK wiki, or anywhere else.Ive just flagged them, but others may have more forceful opinions on the matter. Users/JoePomidor

20110425 23:19:14 nbsp Was there any reason to create new pages for that information? Why not put it all on that one page, where theres context and it makes sense? Users/JoePomidor

20110426 07:40:44 nbsp Jon, please reread the above comments.  Over at the VSM by Jon Li/Talk page you had responded, 5. After I give my paper in July, or maybe even sooner, cleaning up anything I can on the daviswiki will be my top priority.   It is a matter of time and brain space. This stuff is 2nd nature to you, or 1st; there are things that Jason said to me last summer that I have just figured out (and lots that I obviously havent figured out yet). I will set up a location that does not bother you. 

That was May, 2010, almost exactly a year ago.  Over the last couple days, you just created a new set of pages that bring up the exact same issue: theyre not relevant to the Davis Wiki in terms of documenting Davis.  If youre trying to get the community of Davis to focus on international issues via a series of essays, thats again not really DavisWiki material as its not really Davis focused.  The material looks good, it should just go elsewhere.  Im not deleting your pages, but we had been hoping (since last year) youd move them yourself.   Again, I strongly encourage you to either create your own wiki dedicated to your topic of interest, or get your own personal webhost rather than using the wiki.  Users/EdWins
