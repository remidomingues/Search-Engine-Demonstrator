20081002 22:54:11 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Jon, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the long reply responding to the poor review.  The wiki is a great resource for two way communication; not just single sided bashing.  You might want to check out the informal, community written Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide for businesses on the wiki.  Remember that you can edit that (and any) entry just by clicking the Edit icon.  If you have any questions, theres a community of editors who can assist you.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
