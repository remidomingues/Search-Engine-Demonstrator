20050422 10:34:59 nbsp I lived at Glacier Point for a year and hated it. The management was always rude and was never in the Glacier office.  I have lived at Greystone for 2 years now and I love it.  Its maintained much better and the office staff are very friendly. Users/AshleyOrsaba

20051123 12:10:20 nbsp I lived at sycamore lane apts.  They cut our leases short and threw us out so they could remodel and jack the rent prices up. Users/MarieHuynh

20051204 18:56:50 nbsp I dont think I have had a direct experience with John Berkeley Management Inc., per se, but I have lived in two of the apartment complexes that they manage.  The first, Glacier Point Apartments, was terrible and managed by a loathsome old crone.  The second, Allegre Apartments, is (ironically) very pleasant and managed by a kind lady who makes cookies for her tenants.   Users/JonGage

20051204 20:05:32 nbsp Bev makes cookies?  Why did I never see cookies in the four years I was there? Users/JudithTruman

20060315 22:51:30 nbsp lived at saratoga west. I seriously wanted to KILL the people in the office. Old fucking bitches that need to take a dirt nap. went into apartment without our knowledge. READ lease carefully. liers, cheaters, bastards. got 0 of security deposit back. Users/KeCo

20060316 10:17:19 nbsp Check out the Tenant Rights page... if they did not follow the law you can always take them to small claims. County courts have lawyes who advise people when they file claims chek it out http://www.yolocourts.com/smallclaims.html here. Users/JamesSchwab

20070920 13:39:22 nbsp Has anyone else called the managements office directly?  I dont know what their problem is, but the person who answered was totally rude.  No respect at all.  I politely asked her some questions and she answered them, but with plenty of attitude.  Before I disconnected the phone I heard her blab out the name of the apartment complex I live at, and she didnt sound all too happy about it.  Poor service.  Maybe she was having a bad day because I hope shes not like that all the time. Users/Arthur

20090121 10:25:40 nbsp hi i am not shure we are talking about the same company. I didnt know any other company so dedicated to tere job as JB i love this company, management is grate. They understand you and you always can call to main oficce and have your problem solved   Users/Vera

20110711 12:22:49 nbsp I lived in Sorrento for about 7 years. Management there was ok, but we went through a new manager almost every other year. I now live in another property managed by JBM (Tremont Green) and its a different manager every year. Some ok, some not. Users/mechee
