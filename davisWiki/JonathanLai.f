Interesting wiki content management system this is.

I wonder what the backend is, be it dokuwiki or mediawiki or some other derivative.  Hum, perhaps a perusal through opensourcecms.com may help.

Other than that I enjoy learning computer/tech skills on the side, picking up php and mysql, and enjoy messing with webpages, Ill have to leave that suffice for now.

Hey Arlan, MHS Arlan and Davis Arlan, this is Jonathan from those days and now Davis, why did you post a link to projectsycamore.  Its only some prose/poetry with no links.  What is this in reference too?  Is the Daviswiki moin moin server hosted somewhere in north/central davis on Sycamore lane?  ~Jonathan 10/13/05
