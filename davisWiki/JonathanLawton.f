20081109 14:16:37 nbsp hiya, I dont have access to any letter from Student Housing; you might want to contact Darach Miller, who composed the letter posted at BikeChurch/Talk on this site. I think Darach can be reached through KDVS. ) Users/EliseKane

20081109 14:19:15 nbsp Oh, hey JonathanI amend my statement from above: I just looked at BikeChurch/Talk and it looks like someone has posted the letter youve inquired about. There ya go! Users/EliseKane

20081123 10:45:25 nbsp Could that have been referring to Red Orchid Restaurant? Users/JasonAller

20081219 19:47:02 nbsp What a beautiful photo for such a sad subject. Users/JabberWokky

20081219 21:07:14 nbsp I was there!  You left 8 minutes before I responded.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20090208 22:13:35 nbsp Jonathan,
regarding Go Night at Delta:
yes! people actually do show up! Go Night at Delta is Wednesday 7 PM till 9ish this quarter. Depending on the players and the size of the game, each game last anywhere from 20 min to nearly 1 hour.
All levels are welcomed& there is currently a good mix of players in my opinion. I am not sure if you play Go or not, but theyd be glad to teach you if you dont.

Hope to see you there!
  Users/il

20090319 03:26:28 nbsp Your edit was surprisingly comical while I was up late studying. Thanks for the citation Jonathan. Users/MichaelAWoods

20090408 22:05:23 nbsp Great thanks for your help.  Maybe to make things even clearer we should change the title of the growing hops page to just hops, since it does not describe much about growing hops, more just examples of where to find them locally. Users/matiasek

20090410 16:24:11 nbsp Nope! Go Night has been changed to Monday at 8 PM (at least for this month). Come join us!   Users/il

20090426 09:49:16 nbsp Their only problem was roaches and they were closed for a weekend. He was claiming cleanliness issues that forced them to close for a week. Important difference.  Users/WilliamLewis

20090426 10:15:31 nbsp Please dont link that user entry.  The BrianTangney account is not held by Brian... its a sockpuppet by Joe Pomidor created to harass the real Brian. Users/JabberWokky
  I wouldnt say that harassment was the aim, more of proof that he should take the account before someone else did. I did offer to hand it over to him when asked, and shut it down when he didnt want it. Users/JoePomidor
    Harass was a bit harsh... perhaps well intended taunting aimed at educating?  :)  Seriously, ever notice there are more benevolent trolls on Davis Wiki than actual troublemakers? jw
    Haha, yeah, I just was entering my name into google to see if anyone (ahem) had put up any pages with my name in them, and this was the second response. Figured I should probably get a response up here in case anyone else was googling my name and happened across the page. users/JoePomidor
      Ah, in that case, let me clearly state my opinion: Joe is a fine fellow and has established himself as a respected peer editor.  My comment was a quick note to inform, but only within the context of the situation.  Joe is a fine fellow. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091116 13:01:24 nbsp Thank you for the suggestion as to where I might procure kaffir lime leaves. SF is kind of out of the way, so I am considering getting some kaffir lime seeds and growing some myself.
Since you have purchased and used kaffir lime leaves before, I have to ask: Are the leaves a crucial component to thai curry/thai curry paste? I tried to make some thai curry paste myself the other day, sans the lime leaves, but the homemade version was...not very thai curry tasting at all. Of course, my expertise (or lack of) in thai cooking probably had something to do with that, and the recipe, being vegan, probably didnt help matters either... Users/il

20100418 11:37:12 nbsp Nope.  I flipped the logo back as the last thing after checking the wiki, and simply reverted to the wrong version.  My mistake entirely. Users/JabberWokky

20110507 18:32:53 nbsp good to see you at the BBQ Users/StevenDaubert

20110508 12:23:58 nbsp It was nice to meet you also yesterday at Slide Hill Park. Users/BruceHansen

20110509 10:15:53 nbsp Honestly, you were right.  Meeting you in person has totally distinguished you in my mind from the odd connection it kept making since Josh Lawson appeared.   Users/JabberWokky
 No joke! Users/TomGarberson

20110512 14:30:39 nbsp Thanks!  Seems like Downtown might be a good next featured page, but we definitely need to get that list up to date first. Users/TomGarberson

20110512 15:08:24 nbsp Great work on the downtown restaurants! Users/TomGarberson

20110514 17:57:55 nbsp Thanks, it would have been easier for me to revert, then remove the link.  Why did you delete your comment? Users/BruceHansen

20110517 11:57:01 nbsp Poof!  You can do things to Events. Be careful  when you delete one, you cant revert it (which is why its semilocked down to anybody who has been around a bit and asks). Users/JabberWokky

20110521 10:34:49 nbsp Happy birthday, amigo! Users/TomGarberson

20110521 10:36:11 nbsp I didnt know it was your birthday, but have a good one! Users/JabberWokky

20110524 23:51:01 nbsp Im confused... I just got that warning at 23:22:10... why did you delete it?? Users/CovertProfessor

20110524 23:54:02 nbsp Ok, sorry, I see your edit now.  But wtf is up with the system?  I get the emails, not the texts.  I only got one email that said Search underway if suspect seen secure yourself in a safe place call 911 do not approach, suspect has prior mental health further info check www.ucdavis.edu.  I havent yet gotten the cancel message.  The system sucks. Users/CovertProfessor

20110525 00:09:00 nbsp I recall that we were able to say how we wanted to be contacted.  Guess I picked email and you picked text.  Apparently email is second class.  It did spare me from the paycheck message, though. Users/CovertProfessor

20110530 18:38:24 nbsp Thanks for the catch... Users/JabberWokky

20110531 14:32:31 nbsp Pardon me, sir.  +hr runs contrary to everything gnoming on the Wiki stands for.  You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself.

I hope youve learned from this experience and wont do it again. Users/TomGarberson

20110531 15:48:26 nbsp Tempted to create a Ban JonathanLawton page, but I dont know if I have the energy to carry the joke today.  So, Ill just say well played, both JL and CP! Users/TomGarberson

20110603 09:25:42 nbsp Nice cleanup on the Roommates Wanted page! Users/TomGarberson

20110604 16:07:09 nbsp Oops, sorry about that delete! How embarrassing. Thanks for recovering the lost pets page.  Users/kjhewett

20110616 17:02:19 nbsp Why did you cut the comment bar out of the beer section?  Is there another place you suggest I post our beer dinner?  It seemed like a pretty good fit. Users/RhondaGruska

20110617 12:25:39 nbsp Thanks Jonathon.  It was not a well used comment bar for certain.  We need more people talking about beer on the Wiki!  Well, maybe they are too busy drinking it ;)  Your action led me to post on the events page, so thanks for that inspiration. Users/RhondaGruska

20111101 16:47:30 nbsp Thanks for the restore.  It says something when somebody vandalizes and multiple reverts occur at the same time to fix it.  Something about the vast majority of people willing to leap in to help fix, versus the very small number of people breaking things. Users/JabberWokky

20111106 09:55:14 nbsp you seem to be going on a deletingspree here
 Users/ndah100
  Mostly just trying to go through the orphaned pages and either link them to other pages or merge content with other pages. JL

20111106 09:57:12 nbsp Thank you for adding Fiona to the pets page and fixing the link to my page :) Users/LoriOrf

20111106 10:00:56 nbsp but the ketmo menu page you deleted, 90% of the menu is the same, the new menu has like 10 new dishes
So I dont know I am trying to put the page back up, but dont know how Users/ndah100
  Nothing is ever really deleted on the wiki, so any page can be restored to any previous version.  To do so, click on the page title, then info, and then select a version to revert to.  I deleted the wiki page for the KetMoRee menu because it was already unlinked from the KetMoRee page by somebody else (orphaned page), and theres a link to a newer menu with prices from KetMoRees website.  Im not saying the menu page shouldnt exist, but Im not sure what purpose it serves? JL

20120222 17:33:13 nbsp this was a UCD police officer? wtf right by the arc/ orchard intersection? Users/StevenDaubert
  Yeah, I believe it was UCDPD.  She was parked in the bike path, on the west side next to the intersection, facing toward the ARC.  Just sitting in the car, announcing over and over again that cyclists must walk or be fined.  As I walked by, she was yelling at someone from her car for having two headphones in: THATS ANOTHER VIOLATION! but didnt get out to cite him.  The offleash dog that actually was a hazard was completely ignored. JL
  I would honestly go hassle that officer (in the nicest way possible, also for the life of me I cant figure out why they require walking at that spot), but that is just me. Even better that is not a direct lawful order and Im not going to comply, this consensual encounter is over Daubert
   Sounds to me like it was an officer basically just giving mass warnings... in a loud and obnoxious (literally, since it sounds like she was using a megaphone?) way.  Im not sure what there is to hassle her about, other than yelling at students for minor infractions.  It seems like, as long as she wants to see people obey ordinances, the alternative would be actually enforcing infractions via tickets. Users/TomGarberson
   There wasnt anything to be gained by hassling her.  Even if she were wrong, which Im not at all sure of, its not like she would have just apologized and left when confronted.  Best case, she would have ignored me, worst case, Id have been cited or arrested.  Sure, sticking up for rights is important, but the police are legally and physically privileged.  They can do whatever they want and the consequences for their actions, if there are any, are far away in some courtroom.  Confronting police, especially alone, is not a winning strategy.
   What I have done is contacted the bicycle program coordinator at TAPS to see if I can get some clarification on the legality of bikes in crosswalks on the UCD campus.  Ive checked the CVC, Davis Municipal Code, and TAPS rules of the road, and I havent been able to find anything addressing this explicitly, besides a requirement for cyclists to yield to pedestrians.  Ill report back with what I find out.  Update: TAPS thinks the police are wrong, see my comment on Bike Traps. JL
