20090714 13:06:45 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Jonathan, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!   I noticed the photo you uploaded earlier and added it to the page (see under Photos, just above the comments).  You just uploaded a Windows Bitmap file, which doesnt work well on the web, so it wont work on the wiki.  JPG, GIF and PNG files are fine, and the first image you uploaded (which was a JPG file) worked fine.  If you have any questions, just ask  were a friendly community here.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
