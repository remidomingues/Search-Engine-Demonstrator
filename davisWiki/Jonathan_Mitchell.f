Jonathan Mitchell is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2013 ASUCD Election running on the NOW slate.


 Candidate Statement 

Hey Aggies!

My name is Jonathan Mitchell and I am running for ASUCD Senate on the NOW Slate.

I am a Senior majoring in Biological Systems Engineering from Los Angeles. I am the President of the Society of Biological Engineers, a brother and former executive officer of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, and an active member of the UC Davis Boxing Team.

I am running for ASUCD senate to bring a new perspective to student government. As a Senior, I am well versed in the campus community and am aware of the challenges faced by our student population.

Your Senators play an important role in our government, protecting students’ rights.

In addition to being your strong representative I will focus on implementing these two special projects as your Senator:

1. Creating an Online Tutoring Portal:

Students need a lot of academic support at a challenging university like UC Davis. Although the Student Academic Success Center provides tutoring for select courses, it is only accessible during business hours  not at night when most students actually need help with their studies. I intend to create an online tutoring site that will link students to a qualified tutor late at night via chat. Not able to get your code to work? Can’t figure out the stats? Having trouble with that math problem at midnight? This portal would give you access to discuss your issue with a live tutor who will work with you and help you work understand the material before your assignment is due the next morning.

2. Establishing a Direct StudenttoFaculty Advising Program:

Studying at UC Davis affords us access to leaders in the academic community. Our worldrenowned professors are experts in their fields, but sometimes it is difficult to connect with faculty, especially for students who have not decided what they want to specialize in within their major. I will work to establish a faculty advising program that matches students to professors working in the student’s fields of interest and who can advise on classes to take, areas to emphasize, research opportunities, career options, or graduate school. Students would be better able to spend valuable time with professors who are prepared to answer their questions directly.

Please vote Jonathan Mitchell #1 for ASUCD Senate and NOW #26!
