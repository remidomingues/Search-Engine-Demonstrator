Jonathan Soo Hoo was a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate during the Winter 2012 ASUCD Election running as an independent. While he was a candidate, he did absolutely no campaigning, and did not win. The morning of election results, he released the following statement,

    Thanks everyone who supported me! We made the establishment worry this election by going line by line through their budget exposing their wasteful spending. I appreciate your support, & God bless you.
    Well see about election results later, but, at the end of the day, we are all winners because we can always take lessons learnt from this campaign with us. I just cannot thank enough all those other candidates who ran as well, and I wish them the best, even those who went out of their way to criticize me.
    Thank you & God Bless.

He is known for being a leader of Conservative causes around the UC Davis campus and across California.




ASUCD Election

Platform


Hello!

My name is Jonathan Soo Hoo, I am a political science & history major and a candidate serve you as a senator in the ASUCD Senate.  People have asked me, “Why are you running for the ASUCD Senator?” I tell them, “I do not see myself as running, I see myself as walking – walking in God’s Kingdom, trying to walk in the path which God has paved for me”.

Platform Initiatives:
1. Prudence
2. Fiscal Responsibility
3. What I learned from Chess

I have never served in the ASUCD, and I never thought I would serve in the ASUCD Senate.   However, I have seen the failures of the ASUCD to react properly with respect to the Occupy Wall Street Protesters on Campus, and, after much prayer, I have decided its my calling to run for ASUCD Senate, to shake up the establishment, including dedication to prudence.  I am a ready to serve you as a Senator in the ASUCD.

I would appreciate your vote, a vote for an individual who has the proven experience, and the leadership to take a wreckingball to the establishment.

Best Regards,
Jonathan Soo Hoo
Prudence:

Perhaps the gravest and most frustrating individual thing, for me, after the events on November 18, the ASUCD resolution talked of “military grade” pepper spray, of which does not exist, demonstrating a lack of research. Furthermore, the ASUCD Senate did not do a prudent job researching the events, inasmuch as, they hastily jumped to conclusions without talking to officers at the events.  I have done that, and as a senator, I will ensure prudence when dealing with a tough decision – I will gather all of the information from both sides of the conflict, and make a common sense conclusion based on that.

Fiscal Responsibility:

The ASUCD Senate deals with a multimillion dollar budget each year. Every year, it spends its budget, yet we still have random incidents where the Coho ceiling begins leaking during the winters. Why? There has been a flagrant dereliction of duty in terms of the allocation of funds.  We should only provide funds for things necessary, and not upgrade everything under the sun every year. We need to understand fiscal responsibility, and if the ASUCD senate has extra money, it’s the student’s money, and we should not shy away from giving it back to the UC Davis students.

How Chess imitates Life:

In chess you learn the importance of calculating moves in advance, and understanding cause and effect relationships.  I am a nationally recognized expert in Chess, and from Chess, I have learned many things about preparation, logical thinking, and the need to understand every side of every argument.  That kind of objectivism helps cure problems of groupthink.

Where I stand:

Occupy UC Davis/Wall Street

My message to those Occupy Davis folk is short & simple: Protesting on the quad if fine, but encamping on the quad is not.  In short, Get off our Quad.

I am a reasonable person, and if you want to protest, that is your right, BUT it is not your right to occupy the quad. And to the police officers, my message is simple: I appreciate what you do, and please, enforce the law.





20120207 22:06:15 nbsp Anyone who tries to use their religion to boost their political platform has A LOT to learn about leading people.

People have asked me, “Why are you running for the ASUCD Senator?” I tell them, “I do not see myself as running, I see myself as walking – walking in God’s Kingdom, trying to walk in the path which God has paved for me”.  KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF. Stop shoving your religion down everyones throat. How does this have anthing to do with what you think you are going to do for UCD? It doesnt... you are just trying to score brownie points with Christians and ostracize people of other religions. YOU ARE NOT GETTING MY VOTE, AND MANY PEOPLE I HAVE TALK TO AGREE.

20120207 23:54:44 nbsp I am glad you brought this criticism up:

Firstly, let me state this very clearly, I believe in God, I am a proud believer in Jesus, and I am not going to apologize for my faith.

Second, it has everything to do with why I am running: I am not an individual who came to UC Davis, said Oh I want to be in the ASUCD Senate and has geared myself to running by serving in the ASUCD every which way I could. Perhaps, that is the problem we have now: too many individuals run for senate, and get elected by gearing themselves for the position, but in the process become all to accustomed with the way business is handled in the ASUCD Senate, and allow for a sort of group think.  I am an outsider, who is not afraid to step on some toes, and support take my experience leading outside of ASUCD and bring it to the Senate.  I am especially ready to step on the toes of the Occupy UC Davis folk who have a flagrant disregard for the law.  If you do not like that, I am not your candidate, and please do not vote for me.

Thirdly, please stop misrepresenting me with the strawman logical fallacy argument.

Finally, did I mention God or my faith in my platform initiatives? No. I did not.

And to fellow UC Davis students: Look this is what we are up against.  Individuals who will write scathing comments because an individual because they are proud of their faith. I am focused on the issues: I am representing the majority of UC Davis Students who want the Occupy Davis off our quad, yet are too afraid to voice their frustrations.  I am unapologetic, and I am willing to step on some toes to make it happen. We need to restore prudence to the ASUCD Senate, and I will ensure we focus on gathering the facts before making senate resolutions condemning the polices actions. Users/JonathanSooHoo

20120208 08:55:27 nbsp So you want to support and represent the students of UC Davis even though you hate half of them (liberals, protesters and gay people I am assuming because you were a supporter of the antigay platform of Rick Perry). See, What we are up against? Wow...attacking the voters... that is really going to get you a lot of votes, buddy..... NOT! You being so proud of being an unapologetic toe stepper is not going to get you any votes either. Just some advice, people do not want a total jerk representing them. I dont even know you, but from your ridiculous campaign information above and even worse, your above comment, I can see why you are a total outside. :) You must be doing this for fun because there can not be any way you can actually think you have a chance at winning. Your going to take the wisdom you learned from chess????LOL. Chess is not the real world... its a game!!!!!!!!  Users/mathewAcre

20120208 09:28:27 nbsp Jonathan,

First, with what power will you be able to kick out the Occupy movement protesters? I agree that being a ASUCD Senator is a high ranking position and the Occupy protesters must leave, but you will have no control over their right to protest, regardless of how many toes you step on. Please stop blowing smoke up our asses.

Second, its great that you are a proud believer in Jesus Christ! I too share that same belief, but to announce a statement like, I see myself walking walking in Gods Kingdom is clearly a sign to win the Christian vote.  I love my religion, and I love my politics, but I make sure to keep them far apart. If you were not trying to win over the Christian vote, then why did you bring up God in a political advertisement? Dont pull the straw man fallacy card, when you clearly had another incentive.

Third,when you publicize on social networking sites, expect to get some bad feed back. Dont bash the people who will be voting(but probably not) you into office. Frantically attacking individuals shows bad leadership skills, be more like Ronald Reagan, a true leader, and less like Rush Limbaugh, a whinny entertainer. Users/AndrewBusch

20120208 09:50:46 nbsp As a Christian, I am troubled by your campaign. God is bigger than any of your petty politics. I doubt Jesus would approve of you making him a part of your campaign. Surely youve read http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchMatthew%2021:12–17;&versionNIV Matthew 21:1217, no? Jesus doesnt take too kindly to people who use God for personal gain. Implying that youre Gods candidate qualifies. Also, http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchMatthew%206&versionNIV Matthew 6 has a lot to say about righteousness and making a show of it.

Furthermore, although ASUCD issues rarely intersect with issues of Christian morality, youve chosen a rare issue that does. And youre on the wrong side of it. Jesus called us to love everyone. He condemned violence. He would not support the violence Occupy UC Davis has received at the hands of the UC Davis Police Department. And the protestors were http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?searchmatt%205:39&versionNIV Christlike in their response to the violence inflicted upon them by people sworn to protect them. Users/WilliamLewis

20120208 17:55:34 nbsp WHAT!? I am what the UC Davis students are up against??!! Why because I respect other peoples religions? I too am a christian, but I wear it in my heart and not on my sleeve. You say I write scathing comments because you are proud of your religion. I would encourage any and everyone to be proud of their religion. But there is a time and place. You obviously are too pompous, immature and selfrituous too realize that.

Also, I am not trying to misrepresent you, like you accused me... I am going off of the campaign platform you yourself wrote to represent yourself. Maybe take the critique and try to grow from it instead of making a ridiculous claim that I am what the UCD students are up against.

Geez...If you cant take the heat then stay out of the kitchen (and the kitchen is politics). You have totally showcased your lack of leadership in the way you responded to my comment, which you called scathing but was really just an honest reflection. A person running for an office of any kind should respect and appreciate peoples feedback, regardless of if it is complementary or not. You attacking me just shows what lack of understanding you have for others.

Finally, how dare you be so presumptuous to say that you represent the majority. We are all individuals and for you to be so off base to make the claim that you speak for many, just further illustrates that you are the exact type of person we do not need in office.. You sure as hell do not represent me (and by the way... I am a Christian Republican). Users/AnitaLee

20120208 21:53:16 nbsp Before deciding to enter this contest I never thought I would run, never had ambitions to run, and really wanted nothing to do with student government.  I was happy in my niche supporting causes on a statewide and national level. But I personally feel as though there is a higher calling. I know some of the thing that I say, not everyone will agree with, and thats fine, but I am just trying my best to walk the path God have laid out for me. Thats why I am a candidate, and I think it important to understand why people decided to seek office. I understand this campaign will not make me the most popular person on campus but I can take it. To conclude: my faith is the catalyst for my campaign.

I do not want to let the reason for my candidacy distract from the issues at hand and the platforms of my campaign: Prudence, Fiscal Responsibility, and what I learned from my years as a competitive chess player.

You are right, I cannot really force the occupy davis folk off the campus, but as an ASUCD Senator, I would write legislation condemning the Occupy Davis movements flagrant disregard for the law. I would also be a voice for reason and fact gathering before jumping to conclusions when future such as the events on November 18 happen. Users/JonathanSooHoo

20120209 08:38:51 nbsp  FAIL! hAHAhahahahhhahahha!!!

 Sorry but a prerequisite for being senator means that you must be able to write a clear and cohesive English sentence.

 ...history major and a candidate serve you as a senator.

In chess you learn the importance of calculating moves in advance, and understanding cause and effect relationships. I am a nationally recognized expert in Chess, and from Chess, I have learned... You added 3 commas  into these two sentences when you no commas were needed at all and for some odd reason capitalized the word chess. Unless chess is your moms name it is a common noun and deserves no capitalization.

 Individuals who will write scathing comments because an individual because they are proud of their faith. HAHA.

 Ever hear of editing your shit before you post on something as important as your political page??? HAHA. This is SOOO going on a fail website.

Sorry but we need literate people in office who can actually create clear thoughts. This is 3rd grade writing and you still couldnt do it correctly. The writing center helps people like you, dude. I would quit trying to be senator so bad and instead try to meet the University Writing requirement. Haha. Newsflash: Senators kind of have to know how to write a proper sentence.  Users/MayDay23

20120209 08:56:26 nbsp Hi Jonathan.

I think its great you have faith in God (I personally dont care for it, but I wont hold that against you). However, I question the decision to tell everyone that my faith is the catalyst for my campaign. Because, as WilliamLewis has stated, I hope youve read Matthew 21:1217, Jesus doesnt take too kindly to using him as a tool for self gain. What ever happened to actually practicing what you preach? I realize that its tough to disassociate yourself from an important aspect of your life, but frankly, I dont care. If youre going to be running for public office, you better be damn sure youre speaking for your peers and not yourself.

Another point Id like to bring up is your leadership experience: how exactly does being the Director of Finances & Public Relations for the UC Davis Archery Club lead me to believe that you will be the ideal Senate candidate? Youre going to have to clarify. What were your duties as State Chairman for the California Students for Rick Santorum? For Ricky Perry? And what exactly did you do for the DCR? How does your experience help your peers? Under the assumption that you are a conservative leaning student, how closely do you identify with the political candidates on a national level?

Chess is great game, it certainly encourages players to think ahead of the opponent, and thats a great mindset to have in politics. But again, back to the original question, how are you going to use your skills to help the student population? Do you have any initiatives you would like to see in place as soon as you are elected into a Senate position? Users/timchin

20120209 09:48:23 nbsp Why are all your ideas circulated around the pepperspray incident? It was like 4 months ago... get over it! Everyone else has including the occupiers. Let it go. Aside from that, there are so many logical fallacies in your writing it is ridiculous. Military grade pepper spray is just the street name for the high weapons grade agent which is more potent than normal mace that you can buy at a store. How do I know this???My dad owned a tactical gear and rifle shop for over 20 years. Military grade pepper spray absolutely does exist, it just is not classified under the layman’s term “military grade”. Looks like you showcased your own lack of researching.

And quite honestly, the response you made to the first comment made you look like a complete baby. Grow a pair. The criticism wasn’t even that bad and you chose an ad hominem rebuttal.

And why the hell do you keep saying “I never thought I would be running.” That is irrelevant and says nothing. Who cares? What does it matter? Being ASUCD senator is nothing something someone dreams of their whole life. Most of the other candidates never thought they would run; it was just an opportunity that dropped on their lap.

Finally, as a word of advice, I wouldn’t be so proud of the fact you supported someone whose campaign was a total crash and burn and who dropped out because of it (i.e. Rick Perry).

20120210 00:15:31 nbsp Jonathan,

Lets face it well probably both be sharing the honor of holding the Most Hated Person on Campus title  nothing wrong with that at all. I think you have legitimate concerns for the campus you walk on but heres my advice for you  dont run against things, be FOR something.  Wrecking ball to the establishment politics was something I practiced for years in ASUCD, I had a little fun with it but ultimately it got to a point where I had a difficult time actually getting things done. There is room for conservative leadership in ASUCD, fiscal conservatism because the students dont want to see their money wasted. I hope you take the time to research the ASUCD budget and come up with some examples of spending youd like to see stopped.  You, will probably never be satisfied with your student government, but theres a fiscal conservative haven for you amongst the Business and Finance Commission, should you be unsuccessful but still want to be involved I suggest you apply to be on the commission.

Good luck. Users/GregWebb

20120210 12:15:58 nbsp Jonathan,
    To be perfectly honest with you, I do feel bad for some of the comments you have received; they are personal put downs and attack aspects of your being…but to be even more honest, the only person that can be blamed for that is yourself. I do not think you realize what a political platform is supposed to be. It seems like this whole page is an attack of those who do not share your conservative beliefs which is then wrapped in your religious beliefs which you time and time again make the focal point of your campaign.  I am alarmed that someone who studies political science would make the grandiose mistake of combining their religious beliefs with their political beliefs. The separation of church and state does not just apply to the government; it applies to any person in the political arena. Also, you used such phrases as “I want to shake up the establishment” and “take a wreckingball to the establishment”, which directly contradicts your position as a conservative senator who will use prudence in decision making. Also, these are terms you coopted from the same group you used this platform to bash (liberals and occupiers). You attack them for the same thing you say you will go and do, only in a conservative manner. Also, your whole platform is revolved around the pepper spray incident, which has come and gone and is not the defining essence of our University. You inserted only moral judgments and  contradict yourself many times. Then, you make the completely far off assertation that being a good chess player will somehow make you a good senator. If you cannot see how this is absolutely unrelated, then I truly am worried for you as a political science major. Making the claim that being good at chess will make you a good politician is parallel to me making the claim that I should go start my own business because I beat all my family at monopoly. Also, you should be telling about how you want to make things better for everyone, not just attacking one group of people. It becomes incredibly obvious that you have something personal against the occupiers, which is totally fine, but you cannot and should not bring that into your political campaign. Actually, it seems that the content of your campaign revolves only around your hate for this group. They are students of this community and whether you like them or not you will still have to be leading them and must answer to them if you intent on being elected. Finally, your pledge of dedication to Jesus Christ is somewhat problematic when you use it to support violence on our campus. This is a bit hypocritical, is it not? You support the word of Jesus yet you are behind law enforcement in inflicting pain onto others. Remember that Jesus was also a rebel of the state, he also wanted to explode the system, he also was a long haired hippy who probably didn’t shower very often, who preached love and said that it is easier for a camel to get into the eye of a needle than a rich man get into heaven. Would Jesus approve of anyone anywhere being physically harmed, regardless of what the reason was. No, he would not. So that is why so many people have voiced (both in the comments section of this page and in the streets) that you seem like a complete hypocrite who is only using your religion to gain votes. You are absolutely free to disagree with the protestors as many of us do, but to insert yourself as a Chrsitian would mean you would have to practice what you preach. For example, say “I do not personally believe in the political beliefs of the group, but I am wholly against anyone on campus or anywhere in the world, for that matter, being physically harmed because that goes against the word of Jesus.” Also, the way you responded to the first negative comment you got further exemplified that you are indeed a hypocrite. A true politician takes insults as motivation. You should have said… “I am sorry that we do not share similar political views, but I greatly appreciate you taking the time to comment, as well as voice your opinion. I am happy to hear your feedback and am open to any criticism that could help me grow as a person. Thank you for bringing it up, and I hope that if I am elected to serve, I can show you how much good I will do for UC Davis.” Instead of being a true Christian, you attacked the person.  Lastly, I want to address my final complaint (and please do not take this as an attack on your intelligence. I am writing this so that you can learn from all these mistakes, which you will need to do if you really want to have a career in government.) Jonathan, this platform is horribly written. It appears that you have absolutely no in depth knowledge of English and your syntax, grammar and punctuation are absolutely embarrassing. Did you put no effort into this at all? It comes off as if you do not even really care. Along with this, the pixilated photo of you with a scowl on your face making an odd hand gesture poorly pasted over the American flag is just laughable. Once again, please take these criticisms and grow from them. Do not let  them tear you down but instead build you up.
