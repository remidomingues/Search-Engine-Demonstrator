20080904 07:48:15 nbsp Yup  it occasionally happens that real people are mistaken for sockpuppets.  Its just that you both suddenly showed up on the wiki for the first time with a cause.  Not a big deal, and you shouldnt take it personally.  Thats why you were asked about it, so you could answer.  Of course, people sometimes get coy and say well my dog should be allowed to post, too!.  Seriously.  Multiple accounts created at the same time from the same computer to complain about one person is just one of those things where it looks suspicious until people get to know you.  No worries... youre more than welcome here.  Moving past the security guard issue, what do you like about Davis?  :)  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080904 16:47:17 nbsp davis is a quiet town, and i generally am a quiet person, i dont own a sound system, i use headphones.
So,  basically the security guard issue has been such a blast in a very annoying way.

i just dont like people being cocky; thinking they know everything.
