... of a rather unlovely barista making herself even more hideous by her ugly attitude to the job!

What does the blue hair and the baristas appearance have to do with anything?  :/ Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140620 19:44:09 nbsp Not to pile on, but I have to agree with Con. It does you no real service to attack the servers appearance. Its quite well written, but you might want to tone it down a bit. Just a friendly piece of advice... Users/Davidlm

20140620 23:10:41 nbsp youre clearly wrong about there being no other place in Davis for coffee besides Mishkas and Starbucks. You should explore Davis more, because theres a lot of coffee shops here.  Users/MichelleNguyen

Hi Joseph,
First & foremost: welcome to the wiki & thanks for taking the time to share your experience in the peoples republic of Davis.
I noticed a couple things I would like to bring to your attention...
1) The guy who stretches on the tree (Jeff) is an amazing individual
2) The Varsity is run by the same person who owns Mishkas. Its also a local business & not a chain. This is probably why they didnt mind the popcorn
3) users/CoffeeSnobDavis has a lot to say about where to find good coffee in town

I understand that you felt accosted & that the mishkas girl bungled handling things in a classier manner, but do please reconsider the language you used to describe her.
Would you perchance know someone named Brian Kenyon? ~SD
