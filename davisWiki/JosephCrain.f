I moved to Davis on 9/15/2013 from Grass Valley.  At some point in the past I registered NevadaCityWiki.com in hopes if starting a daviswiki clone for Nevada City/Grass Valley.  If you know the area you know there is a lot of arts, music and outdoor activity to enjoy.  I moved to Davis because I took a job with IET at UC Davis.

I look forward to being a participant of this community!

I am also a HipHop/Electronica/Turntabalist DJ. I go by Jay Sea Rain (http://facebook.com/jaysearain) and I look forward to playing gigs and putting together dance events in the area after I have had a chance to settle in!

Other projects I have in the back of my head...maybe they will come to life down here...

Alternative Health Care Program.  A Preventative, Holistic Health Maintenance Plan
Common Good Corporation.  A stamp of approval that your company doing something positive for the global community.
Common Good Housing Corporation.  A CGC (Common Good Corp) that aims to buy and concentrate housing ownership for the purpose of providing affordable housing.
YouBoxIt.  A shared ToGo box system with drop off points.  ToGo Containers are all uniquely decorated with art.

I am a big fan of burning man, art and celebration!
