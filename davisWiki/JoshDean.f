Josh Dean is also Dave Thomas on wiki; he just wanted to see if anyone would notice. I live in North Davis which I love, except for the G line bus. Hopefully I will graduate in 4. 
 I really dont care for ASUCD, but those Ignite flyers were hilarious and I decided to vote, although I dont care because I am graduating. I like doing random things to see how people act, because it is funny.
