20090210 22:44:57 nbsp Your comment on Kyle2008s page makes you look like a raving lunatic, whether you have just cause for this or not.  Just FYI. Users/MasonMurray

Well, I did my job properly then, and thank you! JL

20110120 08:00:13 nbsp Im not sure that a lack of ability in speaking English is racism.  It certainly is a very severe service problem.  I doubt the workers at the McDonalds are lousy at English just to spite people of other races... plus Hispanics that dont speak Spanish.  Its an issue that might be taken more seriously if you rewrote your comment to address the genuine communication difficulties in a more calm manner.  As it is right now, it comes off as kind of a rant.  Your comment, so its up to you.  Im only saying this because it took me a couple of reads to realize that your actual complaint was about being unable to communicate orders. Users/JabberWokky

I will be your voice of the wilderness, you will have to shut me up with force. Users/JoshLawson
   Everything can always be restored easily.  Anything somebody deletes can be put back.  Id guess it was removed because something thought you werent treating the situation seriously.  Just a guess though  maybe their father was killed by somebody from ED.  jw

20110324 17:52:45 nbsp You know, I was having a lousy couple hours.  Then I checked Recent Changes and saw what you added to Banning leafblowers and the Railroad fence page, and I smiled.  Sometimes I think people try to be polite (a good thing) and wind up being scared to voice their honest opinions (a bad thing).  Its kind of refreshing to see you edit: it certainly spices things up, and hopefully makes people a bit more comfortable that they can voice their views. Users/JabberWokky

20110326 20:18:13 nbsp Hey, Bruce deleted your story off Friendly Cab.  I kicked up a discussion to defend it.  It looks like the only serious problem people have is the Facebook and full name. Any chance you would be willing to remove them?  Either way, theres a discussion at {{{Friendly Cab/Talk}}}. Users/JabberWokky

Nope. Not a chance. I ABSOLUTELY need the name, FB account and everything else to stay intact...This site doesnt care about libel (which are lies) so I really believe that the whole truth needs to stand...So JW....do you believe in the 1st Amendment or some Stalinistic perversion of it? JL
    Nobody here is part of the Congress of the United States, so the First Amendment doesnt really apply.  Nor am I looking to slaughter people for their beliefs, so Im not exactly Stalin.  You can stop with the hysterical dramatic fits of selfrighteousness, as its pointless: I dont really give a damn if you see me as worse than the man who shot your dog.  This is a discussion about appropriate content, not your hyperbolic accusations of persecution.  Ive already stated that I support your comment, as it is about in line with what other people have posted.  Not only do I support your comment, I posted clear examples where equivalent statements or worse have been posted about specific business owners and employees to support your comment. The Facebook link is what stands out as unique and seems to be unnecessary if your intent is to call somebody out, as you put it.  I dont see any need for the link other than to encourage harassment.   What was your intent in posting that?  It seems her name would be enough to identify her. jw

20110327 07:14:28 nbsp I assume she will sober up to a state where she can be made aware of what she did.  I wonder if someone will tell her.  I also wonder about your shock and awe. Users/BruceHansen

20110327 09:53:18 nbsp Josh, your personal attacks are way over the line.  You also need to look up communism.  To quote Inigo Montoya, you keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means. Users/TomGarberson

How is writing the truth about someones actions a personal attack? Robyn Brysons name and FB link NEED to be preserved as a warning to other idiots not to misbehave in public. These entitled cunts need to be taught a lesson. As far as looking up communism....all I need to know about those pinko bastards is that they try to rewrite history with lies and silencing the truth..all in the guise of some collective community....sound familiar? yeah....exactly JL


20110327 11:02:04 nbsp People are pretty sensitive to personal attacks here, its never really been tolerated on the wiki.  The more colorful you http://daviswiki.org/Friendly_Cab/Talk?actiondiff&version239&version138 leave your comments, the less likely they are to gather support for keeping their content. And youve been at least a wiki user since 08, so you know no matter how much you whine or argue, no one ever is able to solo win in a wiki edit war. Youre kinda shooting yourself in the foot dude.  Users/EdWins

I really could care less about any of this, or any of you peoples pseudointellectual rantings. No one attacked her and hopefully by the link being included, she will finally hear about the carnage she has inflicted...if anything, she attacked a driver, which is something I DO feel VERY strongly about. Im not here to make any friends, just to share the truth about what goes on. JL

20110327 15:03:04 nbsp Funny you should mention communism.  The wiki, like all websites, is private property.  Youre suggesting that private property owners shouldnt be permitted to establish standards of conduct for people who are on their property.  Against private property rights?  Sounds pretty communist... Users/TomGarberson
 When it suits humiliation of local business, all of the sudden there are standards..Its obvious you guys hate my style, and yes, I hate the way you guys run this site as well...but seriously, dont you all think there are a TON of double standards here? The hypocrisy and favoritism is sickening..you idiots should be ashamed of yourselves... Users/JoshLawson
   I applaud the point you are making, even as I cringe at your language. But Im a fogey in the latter regard. Users/DonShor
   Not just Don and I... there are a few people who havent voiced anything publicly, but have IMed me today with much the same support for the points.  Personally, I like your style, but thats just me.  Im curious, now that youre one of the people helping run the site how you plan to change things.  Itll be interesting with you as one of the active contributors to see what ideas you come up with to improve the wiki. jw
 Yes, for one and most important of my requests is that if a business decides that they are getting the entire town using their reputation as toilet paper, they should be able to leave this site. That really is my main gripe about the goings on around here..Anther change Id like to see is the perception of attacks...the events that I have posted are truthful, firsthand accounts. I feel as if my message has been twisted around and people who arent even on here are being defended while I am getting marginalized, even though I contribute, constructively I might add. Yeah, Im a harsh son of a bitch...the world is a harsh place...Id swear in open court about the Robyn Bryson events and so would the driver...so are we liars? Are we the dicks for getting victimized by the general public? Do good, honest people need this site shitting on their dinner plate? Since this site is so 2005 anyway, it doesnt really matter. If a business wants to opt out...let them out....that is all I really ask. Users/JoshLawson
     The thing about a business opting out of Davis Wiki is that it sort of is like a business trying to opt out of a magazine or a blog reviewing the place. Sure, the business owner has just as much rights to edit the Wiki as any other users, but in the end they are not the only ones deciding what should be on the Wiki. Users/hankim
     I dont understand.  Any business can opt out.  What are you talking about?  You mean opting out from editing, or deleting the things other people wrote about them? jw
      Businesses can not remove adverse comments people make about them or, in some cases, even about their staff. Businesses really are discouraged from changing the page that is about their business. Wiki editors are not supposed to change the edits of other wiki editors; yet, that was done in this case. Harm to an individual is apparently not tolerated; harm to a business is. Im sure you can find examples of discussions weve had about this that you feel disprove my comments, but to cite the most egregious: the local florists staff was defamed and the right of a onetime editor to do so was vigorously supported. And the talk page on that topic remains. Yet Robyn has, this evening, removed the references to herself. If this incident serves as indication of a change in attitudes, great. But it certainly illustrates what Josh describes as a double standard, and lends support to my oftstated contention that the Davis Wiki is antibusiness. Users/DonShor
       My personal belief is that the best weapon against bad speech is more speech. If someone writes something untrue, then the business should respond civilly (or not, but usually that makes the business look bad) and then readers can decide who to believe. Sure, not all businesses have representatives on the Wiki, but that would be like all businesses listening in on everything being said about the business in order to respond to any negative speech. Yes, I agree that Davis Wiki can be anticapitalist/business some of the time, but what can you expect from a mostly liberal college town with people who do not seem to understand that someone at some point worked hard to open a business (unless its Comcast P)? For personal attacks and insults, I am sort of with William on this. If you cannot handle harsh words from some person you dislike or are arguing with, good luck with the real world. Users/hankim
         Correct.  Which is all stuff that Im dead set against.  You are aware that I was the one who called out the deletion of Joshs comment as being a double standard, correct?  Check out my first reply on the {{{Friendly Cab/Talk Talk page}}} (the long second comment under Discussion). I pointed out a whole litany of cases where the exact same kinds of comments were made about businesses.  You seem to keep thinking that Im on the opposite side of this.  Im against having comments on the wiki, period, because they are then cloaked in what some people see as a sacred halo of being unalterable text, which creates a slew of serious problems.  Ive been railing on this exact topic for many, many years, Don. jw
        Pretend I was replying to hankim. My response was threaded after yours but not directed specifically at you. Don
     I agree with you that the no personal attacks thing is bullshit.  Plenty of personal attacks have a pointcategorically ruling them out only harms the wiki. If there is a point to them and you stand behind them (especially with a name), the truth shouldnt take a back seat to civility. (note well: this is just a general statement of wiki philosophy and not a comment on the merit of any recent edits by JL or others) wl



20110327 15:50:00 nbsp Its all good Josh. I know you dont have a habit of spreading lies or anything.

20110328 18:39:06 nbsp Thanks for speaking your mind, Josh. Im sorry for doubting you. If they ban you, Im gonna quit the wiki. Fuck it. Users/ScottMeehleib
 You seriously think the ban is about speaking the truth?  ARWENNHOLD proposed it because Josh is trying to use the wiki to hurt other people in the real world.  It has nothing to do with what happened between Josh and Robyn (nothing) or between a third party and Robyn (the incident described).  It has to do with what is and is not OK to use the wiki for.  Youre a great editor, Scott.  I dont know what youre freaking out about, but I think you misunderstand the situation. Users/TomGarberson
     Yes, it does honestly feel that the ban is about speaking the truth at this moment. Obviously, I understand that you are upset about his attitude as well, but I just havent seen enough to warrant the feeling that he deserves being banned. Its possible that my perception is wrong, and I will try to give some time to think about it, but that is my honest feeling at this time. SM
    People should be accountable for their actions, in the real world.....How is a truthful account verified by the source hurting someone? So I guess the truth is not OK, especially if the truth is inconvenient...this ban is bullshit anyway, and everyone knows it. Users/JoshLawson

20110329 16:02:33 nbsp What about your dedication to Stephen W. Hawking? Users/BruceHansen
     That was the coolest thing that ever happened in this town and anyone who was there knows it. JL
        Sarah (my wife) was there, and thought it was very cool  was there some particular aspect that you guys are referring to? jw
       What Art is referring to was the night that Steven Hawking went down to the G Street Pub...during Karaoke Night. When my turn came around I had dedicated,  I Wanna Be Sedated from the Ramones, to, and I quote, Steven Hawking, the only intelligent person in this bar right now!  In the lyrics a line keeps getting repeated 4 or 5 times: I cant control my fingers, I cant control my toes, and Put me in a wheelchair and get me to the show....so as you might imagine everyone in the crowd was either wanting to lynch me, laughing, holding back laughter or sitting there in utter astonishment...it was totally epic. Shit like this just proves how fucking awesome I truly am. Users/JoshLawson
         This was a great blurb, Josh, for lack of a better word.  Would you care to say how you made that selection?  Did you just kind of take a stab at it?  Didnt the ramifications become apparent during the performance?  With some trepidation... bh


Josh, I hope in the future youll consider collaborative editing and being halfway civil with people. Personal attacks (insults, berating people, or trying to get back at people via the wiki) will dramatically change the tone of the wiki, turning it from an informational resource for Davis into a place where people who arent accustomed to internet culture or dont have thick skins will be afraid or unwilling to participate. That will be a loss for everyone involved, because itll be a loss for the wiki itself. Collaborative editing is what has made the wiki into the resource it is today. When there are disagreements over content, people explain why they think it should be one way or other other and either come up with a compromise or put it to a vote (democratic, not communist, for what its worth). I know you get a kick out of stirring things up, but berating people who disagree with you or claiming youre being oppressed isnt a workable way of approaching things on the wiki. As entertaining as it may be, its a destructive approach to something thats been built with a lot of constructive work by a lot of different people. Im not quite sure why some people lost sight of that during this discussion and decided people like Arwennhold and myself were upset at you for being a pottymouth or whatever. That has nothing to do with it. I realize youll probably ignore this, since you believe Im just trying to somehow oppress you by explaining wiki norms (and youve apparently got Scott and Wes sold on the idea). It needed to be said, though, since for some reason most of the folks here, whove said it many times before when personal attacks or nonconstructive disputes come up, arent willing to say it this time around. Users/TomGarberson
 The end game of what Im attempting to do is be the first Neocon mayor of Davis. I will rule this Burg with an iron fist. The first thing Id do is run all of the commies, vegetarians, and sicko pinkos outta town. How would I do this? BURN DOWN THE COOP and build a WalMart there...Users/JoshLawson

             I think if youve never known a decent jackass, you come across as actually being dangerous.  Ive known a guy who, when I met them, looked me straight in the eyes and said Lets make one thing clear: Im an asshole.  And he really was... and also one of the best examples of chivalry I could ever think of.  The guys style might be nasty, but hed go to the floor for a friend every time.  Im not saying youre that good, but Ive known enough rough characters whove been honorable to give you a chance, but not everybody has.  If you havent known that type of person, its reasonable to classify you as a malicious jerk, which is who weve gotten here in the past (and who have been banned when they actually started threatening people face to face or standing outside their homes). Part of it is that its hard to get the subtleties across in the written word to tell the difference between the two. jw
              I am VERY loyal to my friends and yes, cold calculated and vicious to my enemies.

I used to do lots of drugs and drink..I almost died. I decided to become the best person I could be..that involves sobriety...youll learn some day, boy. JL
    Yup, I wont live long at such levels of consumption either, Dad. I agree that to be the best person, I got to ditch it but Im too weak for now. I guess I just dont care enough. (Actually, thats not quite true. Im seeing a shrink tomorrow and planning to start going to AA if I dont puss out, that is) SM
    You went to bat for me when a bunch of assholes tried to fuck me over. if you ever want to learn the ways of prideful defiance..lemme know. Plus if you ever need a ride or someone to go to an NA/AA meeting, I have a car and would gladly go with you. More sober people equals more hate and acid poured on this rotting world, which is completely metal in every way.

    Hey, Ive seen a heck of a lot of people hit that point.  Its a good sign youre stating it publicly (not to be a 12 step geek, but thats the first step for a reason).  Seriously  Best of luck in finding the right people to help you out, Scott.  jw
       Thanks for your support guys. It means a lot. Im not very familiar with the 12 steps but if Ive somehow stumbled into the first one, I must be doing something right. I also want to publicly thank Tom Garberson, who has sent me a lot of encouraging emails the last few days.  Users/ScottMeehleib

You answer me that and maybe we can address your totally inconsequential pseudointellectual gripe....I use my real name, because I dont give a fuck, and Im proud of everything I write..maybe one of you commies cant handle this and will erase me out of your nerd utopia...you dorks already tried, remember? users/JoshLawson
     This is a resource for Davis.  Each page has a topic.  Things that arent about a pages topic dont belong on that page.  Putting it on your user page, like you did, is perfect. tg
     whatever. JL




I think its really important to squash free speech, especially comments that are objectionable and dont suck up to the long standing wiki editors. As we all know, they are above and beyond any sort of judgment and can do no wrong. I also strongly support suppressing any swear words or concepts that have anything to do with real world controversy. Davis really is a G rated city, and we as editors have a duty to clean up the internet, and to flame war into submission any small business owner trying desperately to uphold his reputation. With your help, people, we really can turn America into the Christian version of Iran! Who needs any sort of neutrality when we can all work together for the common good...the ends justify the means, right? Think globally, suppress free speech and destroy the opposition locally.... Im glad to be a part of this burgeoning collective movement, it shows a lot of promise...now to do away with that pesky First Amendment....one wiki editor at a time...California Uber Alles!!!!

 Dont get so trolled now budday Daubert


hey fuck you buddy, I consider myself a friend of yours and Im on here Daubert
     This really is FaceBook for retards, there isnt even a Like button!!! JL
 I dont use facebook so I have no idea what you are talking about Daubert
As for no like button check this out: Daubert Likes the fact that Lawlson is a slapdick on the wiki!
      I have fun on here (mostly at others expense) but in reality, Im fighting the arrogance and self importance that have ruined the credibility of this site. I would like to see it come back to some form of usefulness, but the egos and Aholes that post here regularly are such sacks of shit, that the world would be a better place if they just got gunned down in the streets, think Chinese Revolution style. The world could use WAY less pseudointellectuals like them, and a LOTS more straight shooters like me. users/JoshLawson

One DavisWiki Asshole to another, more vociferous one:  Raise your chin and Grab some Beer, Bin Ladens Dead, Go Grab some BEER!!!  Users/WesP

I would concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement Daubert
     Good call Wes!!!!!JL

Hey guy I know you are in the bar scene and all I wanted to run something by you:

call it 4 months ago I happened to be downtown picking up some drunkies whom I hadnt seen in a while. It was like 2:05 AM and I had agreed to meet them on the corner of G and 3rd. Im standing on the South East corner of the intersection back to Ketmo when bouncer dude tries to Bro up on me. He rolls up on me trying to flex and look intimidating and says YOU NEED TO LEAVE, NOW I looked at him like he was crazy and said I have nothing to do with your establishment and Im a private citizen on public property and you are a private citizen you dont tell me what to do. Dude tries to tell me its immaterial and that I need to bounce. At this point Im committed to my stance cause fuck that you can kick rocks, want me to flag down the officer I see down the street and see who is right? I honestly dont care that Im in front (off to the side standing on the traffic calming planter) of your bar that is closing, Im minding my own business and I havent patronized your establishment. You can do what you want inside your place of business, but Im not in it... If dude was polite it would have been no problem I would have dipped but he tried to flex on me and gave me a direct order... You arent a cop I dont have to obey your direct lawful orders. Im not trespassing Im on public property... I understand the need to flush the people out of the bar, and then get them to stop congregating in front of it, but Im no punk and if you come at me tripping you can sod off

Who is right?

Well you certainly werent exaggerating or being dramatic in your comment on Travis page Lawlson.  Additionally I just saw a pink elephant outside my window.  oy

What do you mean you made it so it cant be reverted?  It sounds like youre saying he did some kind of technical trick.  You do realize Tom has the same capabilities on the wiki as you... and neither of you can do that?  Incidentally, it was Tom who did the edit youre complaining about, not a cabal of you guys.  A grammatically implied plurality of opposition does not make you a victim worthy of politically correct pandering.  Please stand by and be responsible for your own actions, and please give Tom the same respect and have him stand by and be responsible for his actions.  jw
    where did it go then? I looked for it and it was completely gone. JL
         Assuming you mean McDonalds, Its version 104, I believe.  Some replies and edits to the replies follow, and then edit 110 is Tom removing the whole thread.  http://daviswiki.org/McDonald%27s?actioninfo See here. jw

Please dont berate people on the Wiki, Josh. Users/TomGarberson (who didnt make it impossible to revert anything)
 On a separate note, I was at a party in South Davis this weekend and a couple of friends needed to get a ride home.  They went to call a cab and another friend said, and I quote, Dont call Village Cab, those guys are huge assholes.  No, he doesnt edit on the Wiki, and yes, he was talking about your edits on here (I asked).  As I recall, you came here to stop someone from hurting the reputation of your company.  Now look what youre doing. tg (I think they decided on College Cab, but Im not positive)
  I dont even believe this account of this party to be entirely factual. We might be assholes, but I think the BIGGER assholes are folks that force lies to stay up on some website and troll the owner ruthlessly for desperately trying to defend his business . Besides, I have gotten MANY calls where the customers commend me for standing up to you guys and doing what I believe to be right..One of these folks happened to be the owner of College Cab, BTW. Do I care if some individual who probably has never ridden with us is an opinionated asshole? Not really...welcome to your little club. I take care of the things that actually matter, like burned out headlights, inspections on motor mounts, brake rotors, tracking MPG and oil consumption..you know, actual important things that matter....The fact is, we are clean sober drivers that are 100% committed to doing the best jobs that we can. Unlike some guys on a website committed to telling a biased, one sided story. Like...oh...I dont know...DavisWiki comes to mind...JL
   You really think Im/were out to get you, dont you?  I really dont care about you, Josh.  Youre a mild nuisance that requires the occasional reversion or deletion when you abuse other users or post racist stuff.  Im not entirely sure what proportion of the content you put on here is trolling, as opposed to genuine, but it doesnt really matter.  If its bad content, its going to get removed.  The funny thing is, Evan is absolutely right: you probably could bring a unique perspective to the Wiki and really add something.  Id love to see that happen.  As long as the only thing you add is geared toward degrading people or driving them away, though, Im going to continue removing it. Users/TomGarbersonfootnote(As for the party, youre welcome to believe what you want.  Im sure I could provide names, social security numbers, and long form birth certificates, and youd still believe what you want to believe.  It was absolutely hilarious when it happened, and Ill probably be chucking about it all week.)
     Its funny how I got along with all of you guys in person and you saw how serious and committed I am to my work and everything I do in life. Look at how I got jumped into this rather exclusive community...There has never been a welcome mat for me, as if I need that....I DO bring excellence to this trash heap with every post that I lay down and it doesnt get any more Davis than me. 1976 and onward, homeboy.
 Racist huh? Not at all, I just say what I feel and what I perceive. I cant even understand why you would say that...How would you like foreign people illegally practicing law with a 4th grade education and undercutting you? Yeah, it sucks fat shit, dude. Its too bad you people where such cowards to my face that you all didnt confront me with any of these issues you guys have with me. Every one of you just decided to be an ITGs on here....This kind of yellow bellied behavior is typical of people like you. Knowing that you are a petty weasel that NEEDS to have the last word, I will put this post down with my typical supremacy of content...Almost like Im practicing law with a 4th grade education, wouldnt you agree, Mr. Ambulance Chaser? JL
        Funny, your welcome here was http://daviswiki.org/Users/JoshLawson?actionrecall&version1 pretty friendly.  Youve had several friendly lets try this agains.  Like everyone else at the BBQ, I wanted a chance to meet people Ive interacted with over the Wiki and generally have a good time.  Bringing up Wiki arguments doesnt quite fit the bill, and most of us have no trouble getting along just fine, sans conspiracy theories, both before and after meeting in person.  Again, Im not quite sure why you think anyones out to get you, but my beef is with bad content.  If you add bad content to the Wiki, I (or others) will remove it.  If you add good content, everyone will be thrilled.  Maybe someday, right? Users/TomGarberson Mr. AC
