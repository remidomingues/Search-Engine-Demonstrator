Josh Lawson is a politician from Davis California who is running a politicalpartyfree campaign for City Council. His platform is personal responsibility, honesty and exposing hypocrisy wherever it appears.

Mr. Lawson has contributed to the local arts culture, public safety and transportation. He currently resides in the Death Metal Frat House with his life partner, Snoot.

He has been a member of many musical bands of the past and present. His active projects include Glug, Death Remedy, and Avenue Saints.

He is also a nontraditional, nonjudgmental abortion provider. He works out of compassion and not for the love of money.
