20120711 15:41:09 nbsp Let me offer you a belated welcome to the wiki.  DavisPost sounds like a neat venture and I understand why you would want to promote it.  However, I think youre going a bit too far with the links.  DavisPost is not a cheap textbook nor a bicycle shop.  If we listed every place that one could find out about bicycles, the page would no longer be useful to the wiki community.  Please delete those links and limit the links to DavisPost to those that are directly relevant. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 15:50:14 nbsp Ditto on the welcome to the wiki!  I went ahead and moved DavisPost on the Bike Shops page down to bullet point about classifieds, since that seems a bit more relevant.  Doing the same for textbooks on the Cheap Textbook Guide might be a good solution... Im just not that familiar with the options there, so I didnt know how to make the edit. Users/TomGarberson
