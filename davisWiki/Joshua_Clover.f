Image(joshclover.jpg, photo by Elise Kane for The California Aggie, thumbnail) Joshua Clover is a UC Davis professor of English and an accomplished professional writer. He also happens to own an amazing tshirt that says Who the Fuck Is Mick Jagger? on it. Clover said he bought it because he didnt understand it. Other awesome shirts include Piece Now (with a large picture of a gun), I (heart) Baile Funk, and WWCD? (What Would Courtney Love Do).

Clover is quoted in Memorable Quotes. He was featured in The California Aggie in late 2005, though the archive is not available online at this time.

Clover read his poetry on July 12th, 2007, at Bistro 33 at 8:30 pm. Rumor has it that free wine was served courtesy of the poet.
