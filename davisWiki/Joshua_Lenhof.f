 Candidate Statement 

> Vote Joshua Lenhof: Ignite IGNITE SLATE. <

My name is Joshua J. Lenhof; I grew up in Scripps Ranch, which is as Southern California as one can get, where I learned to surf and play club soccer.  I have attended UC Davis for the last three years and am working on a major in Exercise Biology. In addition, I am conducting a research project in collaboration with John Labavich, and Alonso Perez concerning the effects and symptoms of Pierces Disease on grape vines. Currently, I am involved with First Baptist Church and the UCD Racquetball Club.

However, I am first and foremost a student and I have been around long enough to understand what people approve of and disapprove of on our campus.  Thus, the primary reason I am running for a senate position is to have an impact on our campus. I will transform this campus by improving the services that students use on a daily basis and cut out useless spending on aspects that obviously dont benefit students as a whole. Trust me; I am going to be an actual leader, unlike other senators in the past who do not have their act together. I am willing to take chances and pursue legislation that is actually meaningful and important to students like me.

Things I want to change:
 1.  Anyone driving to attend late classes or wants to exercise at the Arc in the evenings knows how annoying it is to find PARKING!!! Thus, I want to change the parking rules to allow people without parking permits to park on campus after 7:00 p.m. instead of 9:00 p.m. on Fridays.
 2.  What actually happens with all those student evaluations you fill out? Nothing really. Since picking the right professor is quite important I wish to implement a system which provides UCD students with a Course catalogue like book providing actual student feedback about certain professors.
 3.  I will work with student friendly businesses to open a Java California 24hr coffee shop in order to reduce the number of people in the library 24 Hour Reading Room reading room and provide another study atmosphere for people who study late at night.
