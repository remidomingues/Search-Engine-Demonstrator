Cocaine is handy dandy nostril candy



First name is Lawrence, I also go by Larry.
Big fan of Kentucky Wildcat Basketball

Currently a UCD transfer student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (yeah it sounds like two majors but its one!)
I like sports, working out, and NOT studying.

I am a magician with computers, and was a computer technician.

Nowadays I go to school, come back from school, eat, sleep, rinse, repeat. Nonetheless I have a rather nice stockpile of hard liquor and good beer to hasten the cycle to my bachelors degree.

I also drive a 05 Prius with rims.
