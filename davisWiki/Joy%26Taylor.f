Joy and Taylor can tell the rest of the wiki about themselves by clicking the Edit button to edit this page.

20091204 21:58:31 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  You may also want to read Welcome to the wiki/Business owner.  I made some edits on the Joy and Taylors Raw Chocolates that you created.  Some of it was just cleanup and adding links and such.  But I also added a table at the top of the page so that the page would be like the other wiki business pages.  It would be good if you could add information to it... hours of operation, address, etc.  Or, if some things are not relevant for your business, you can delete them.  Also, I changed the language from first person to third person (from we to they) and took out some of the exclamation points.  The reason I did that is that pages on the wiki are community resources for the community to edit; the wiki isnt a business listing site.  So, generally pages about businesses avoid marketingspeak.  But I dont think I changed very much  you created a nice page with lots of good information on it.

On a more personal note, I love chocolate, and so I am very excited about your business!  I hope to be trying it soon. Users/CovertProfessor
