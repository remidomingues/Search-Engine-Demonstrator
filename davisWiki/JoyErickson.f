20110601 17:12:00 nbsp Hi Joy, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for editing under your real name, it really helps people feel connected.  When you have a moment, check out the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page  theres a lot of good information there.  Or, if you want, you can check out one of the drafts that are under construction for replacing the business owner welcome (Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner/Talk/Draft D this draft seems to be the current favorite)... it might be a bit easier to read.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask! Users/TomGarberson
