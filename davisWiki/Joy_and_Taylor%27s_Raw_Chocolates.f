Make some bacon chocolate like http://www.vosgeschocolate.com/product/bacon_exotic_candy_bar/exotic_candy_bars and I will buy some  Users/StevenDaubert

 {{{^}}}Steven, would you like your Bacon Crispy or Chewy?  I personally like it a bit chewy but I think that crisp would be better suited for in the chocolate.  How much would you be willing to buy?  I have a batch of chocolate going right now, I could make some bacon for you.

 {{{}}}Stevens Chocolate order WILL NOT be Vegan, my appologies to the Vegan community.  Dont worry though the Bacon will not get anywhere near the rest of the batch I promise!
Im still down for this, I just need to get some really good bacon, I would start small as it would be something of a treat, or something to share with friends... Anyways I havent forgotten Daubert

20091204 22:01:25 nbsp What is goji goodness?  Im a big fan of the goji bar made by vosges which is berries and salt.  Its amazing!

Also do you prepare any sugar free bars (made with say maltose or agave nectar)?  I have some family/friends on restrictive diets for health reasons (no vitamin D enriched milk for example) and it would be great to know if you have any specialty bars I could get them as a Christmas treat.

20091205 13:48:02 nbsp So Joy and Taylors Raw Chocolates are currently sweetened Exclusively with Raw Organic Agave Nectar.  That means All of the chocolates are low glycemic, though people are always shocked when they find this out after eating them. The Goji Goodness flavor is an Organic Himalayan Goji with Pink Himalayan Seasalt, so surely OliviaY will be in love when she tries it. Users/Joy&Taylor

20110228 23:43:20 nbsp Their products are available for sale in retail stores  the Davis Food Coop is where Ive bought it. Their dark chocolate is considerably different from other, more conventional ones — its so different, many are willing to pay what it costs to get a pure, fairtraded, raw product. Users/DougWalter
