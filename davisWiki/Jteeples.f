Hey,

Im new to the area, and am filing in information where I can about the various things I find in town.  Ive lived across America, so I have been told that I have a pretty unique way of looking at things.  I hope that we can all add a little something to the site to make it a bit more full and give anyone who visits this area a feel for what they are in for.

     I will say that i find it strange that things that I post seem to dissappear very quickly, but things that others post that are in bad taste/untrue, are defended.  The more I see it the more I wonder about the actual purpose of the wiki...  I was originally under the impression that it was for facts about the area, but that was quickly proven wrong.  Apparently its for facts, along with rumors and gossip.  I apologize if its going to take me time to adjust to this.  I was really excited about something that would actually tell people about the area, rather than be a rumor mill.  But thats ok.


20090322 15:12:54 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. You might want to go and read http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/vc/tocd11c1a4.htm and look at the section on http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc21212.htm youth helmets and double check with http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html about the cell phones on bikes.

20090323 18:03:22 nbsp Thanks for adding all that information to the Bicycling Tips page. It can be hard to keep up with all of the peculiarities of the law. I always wear my helmet, carry lights and am pretty good about abstaining from using the phone. Users/JasonAller

20090723 14:25:03 nbsp Out of curiosity, what would be wrong with sexual advertising, anyway?  wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090723 14:31:29 nbsp Sexual advertising is most certainly not illegal.  Ever hear of swinger magazines?  Or read the personals in the Sacramento News and Review? Users/JabberWokky

20090723 15:02:33 nbsp Theres no fine line. Youre perfectly allowed to publish I want sex all you want.  Its part of that whole bill of rights thing, right up there at the top of the list. Users/JabberWokky

20090723 15:06:34 nbsp You know, it just occurred to me that you might be thinking of advertising for prostitution, which is an criminal act and is an entirely different situation.  Just asking for sex is a pretty commonly published plea.  That and for chicken farm equipment for some reason.  Lots of chicken farm equipment.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20090723 17:20:58 nbsp Adjusting seat height based on its distance from the ground isnt the best way of doing it.  It can give a quickanddirty estimate, but the height should be adjusted further from there, since the correct adjustment is based on the saddles distance from the crank (and the riders extension of the legs).  Different bikes have different distances from the crank to the ground, so where one bike might be correctly adjusted by this method, another will not.  Example:  fullsuspension mountain bikes  even the variety sold at WalMart have a crank that is significantly higher off the ground than most other bikes; road bikes tend to have much lower cranks, with other mountain bikes and hybrids in between.  Old bikes (greater than 15 or so years old) may work sufficiently well with the method you suggest.  The method I gave is what Ive learned from several years of fitting people to bikes and getting paid to do so.  If my explanation is unclear, let me know so I can attempt to be clearer.

20090723 20:49:10 nbsp Hey, no problem: the wiki is a living reflection of the community.  Dont worry about making mistakes, and dont take feedback as anything other than straightforward discussion.  Were all working together and seldom agree entirely, so communicating back and forth is part of the process of finding a good common ground so that the wiki reflects many points of view.  Its a very friendly group once you understand the flow. Users/JabberWokky

20090723 20:58:57 nbsp Makes much better sense now.  Of course, freshmen will still make stupid mistakes and there will be plenty of mishaps in the fall, but maybe well prevent some.  Also, does it make me a bad person that I find it entertaining that there are people who spectate at the bike circles the first week of classes? Users/BrettHall

20090731 18:40:13 nbsp Ha!  Thanks :) Users/BrettHall
