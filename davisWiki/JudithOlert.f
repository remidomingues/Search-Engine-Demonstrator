Describe JudithOlert here.
True nomad working as bank advisor (microfinance) in developing countries.
Completing assignments in Central Asia and Eastern Europe next year,
afterwards heading for subsaharan Africa.
Revisited Davis recently 20 years after being an exchange student at Davis Senior High.
Still love the place, but where did my beloved Cafe Roma go?!?
:)

Too bad I found this page too late, I would have loved to meet up with a few more people
(you know who you are :) )

Hopefully next time.
All the best,
j.

PS Didnt expect the pics to turn out so big, sorry!
