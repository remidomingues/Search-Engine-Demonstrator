Judith Truman is an alumna and Townies Townie.  She remembers when the Wiki was this new project that was slowly gathering speed and documenting the city and community of Davis.  Its nifty that theres a town culture!  Her wikifu has increased over the years.  She enjoys reading, cooking, set dancing, social dancing, music, biking, long walks, and more!

 Im trying to seed articles from items mentioned in Wendy Weitzels Comings and Goings column. Downtown has been changing a lot over the past few years.

Favorites:
tea list chicken salad
Village Bakery Barberi bread: its like sesame foccacia
Newsbeat greeting cards and Zots
Davis Food Coop obscure vegetables
Nugget general grocery selection
Yolo County Library  Mary L. Stephens Branch books galore, plus DVDs, audio CDs, and more books!!  Going here saves me yards of shelf space annually. I once had to use a Bic pen to crack my own rusty bike lock off my bike here.


Discussion Questions:

Does Sugar Daddies have chocolatemint ice cream where its a chocolate base with mint flavor?  Does anybody make Sweet Cream (plain) ice cream in the style of Marble Slab?  Is it simply time to break out the ice cream maker?

Recommendations for eye care professionals?  Its about time for new glasses.


20100911 23:50:26 nbsp Ohh, cool, thanks! Users/TomGarberson

20101004 14:57:30 nbsp The low priced items in the ZT menu are addons to the ramen, I dont think you can order them alone.  Do you still want to know what they are in english? Users/CharlesWinkelmann

20101021 11:12:39 nbsp No problem!  I had looked briefly a couple of times already and didnt see it.  Finally went through each individual doubleapostrophe to see whether there was a full quote in its place, before noticing the missing bit. Users/TomGarberson

20101021 13:15:53 nbsp Nice recipe!  Early on, there were a bunch of recipes added to the wiki, but at some point they stopped.  I have a couple that might fit in there if it goes another week.  My wife loves Skash  zukes, yellow squash, onion and apples (that last ingredient changes everything).  If I can find my stick blender (still have a shrinking number of boxes two months after a move!), well be making lima bean soup.  When I do, Ill pay attention and write down the recipe.  I pretty much always cook without a recipe. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101021 23:16:55 nbsp I had lemon chicken in the style you describe at Ding How. Unfortunately, it was vegetarian. But it was delicious. (The vegetarian meat at Ding How has an uncanny resemblance in both taste and texture to real meat!)

Also: Peets. Mishka has too much attitude.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20101023 02:50:08 nbsp Great page. Id say archive after a few weeks. Thanks for starting this! Users/DonShor

20101027 17:53:48 nbsp But like... thats actual work... Users/hankim

20101027 21:08:39 nbsp In my experience, whenever a campusaffiliated organization starts off on a project they really end up doing nothing useful and spending a bunch of money, then they go on about the amazing job that they did. Campus Recreation and ASUCD are the ones that most easily come to mind. Anyway, when I decided to do a healthy cut from 220 pounds to 205 pounds, I ended up saving a bunch of time and money on food. Who knew doing a bunch of cooking at the beginning of the week and then living off of rice, cold sandwiches, tilapia fillets, chicken breasts, and boiled eggs could save time and money? Users/hankim

20101103 12:22:52 nbsp I think they were editing to open the project, and so were withdrawing their prior request to not edit the page.  Check the concurrent edit made to the main page, which seems to confirm that intent.  Yeah, we wiki regulars like to keep things nice and threaded so we can see how the discussion evolved, but I can see somebody deleting their request with the intent that it simply be withdrawn rather than hiding information.  Kind of like how people periodically delete entire entries when they just meant to delete their comment.

Of course, I am not them, so I could be completely and utterly wrong in how Im reading that edit.  But, I think theres room for it not to be the typical Im deleting my words because I dont want to talk anymore. Users/JabberWokky

20101103 12:33:58 nbsp Hey, as somebody who is not at all educated about Chinese cuisine but loves good Beef Chow Fun, what is wok hay?  Google is not very helpful, as the term seems to be used for various things, including restaurant names.  While Im at it, is there a difference between Chow Fun and Ho Fun (or are they, as Ive assumed, transliterations to English menus of the same word)?  I merely know what I like and try to order something different when I see it on the menu, but I have zero culinary knowledge of the various dishes.   Users/JabberWokky

20101103 13:02:34 nbsp Ah, ha!  I know exactly what you are talking about.  That is why when I lived in Pennsylvania I always ordered from one place versus the other two nearby places.  There was a scorchy, bright flavor missing from the other two restaurants.  Different from, but similar to how properly browned meat transforms a dishs flavor.  I was unaware of the term, but I certainly know the taste.  Thanks for the enlightenment. Users/JabberWokky

20111201 22:10:57 nbsp Ive never branched out from naan on the bread front, but Ill have to give the other stuff a try now.  Thanks for the recommendation!  Im honestly terrified to get lassis through a store because I know Id get hooked.  Itd be like if I started making thai iced tea at home... bad news.  Tasty, tasty bad news. Users/TomGarberson

20120206 12:59:12 nbsp Its plausible that she did her hair.  http://www.hairbyelizabeth.com/about_us  shows a decent number of Hollywood area jobs.  Of course, that does not mean she has the rights to the photo, and you were almost certainly right to remove it, but the whole copyright thing is a bit confusing to many people.  Based on her website, she does some pretty neat stuff.  Far more than is noted on the wiki.  She has a wide ranging portfolio, including special effects and hair restoration for the bald.  Cool stuff. Users/JabberWokky

20120213 14:52:42 nbsp For most purposes, 6mbps downstream and 3mbps upstream would be enough.  Ive got a faster option through Comcast  I think 20/10 (downstream/upstream) or something, and in practice I usually get around 12/7 on speedtest.net.  1 mbps might be enough for some bnet games if thats the only thing youre doing, but if youre likely to have anyone else in the household using the interwebs at the same time, it probably wont cut it.  A friend of mine has a 6/1.5 mbps connection in Woodland and he runs into problems with Modern Warfare (360) any time a roommate does anything more than just check email. Users/TomGarberson

20120918 00:35:16 nbsp Hi Judith, You added a table of contents to the private tutoring page, but the links in this table of contents dont all work.  Specifically, in the math section, when one clicks on Douglas Halket, Mike and Terri Leonard, and Barnabas Truman, one is not taken to their listings.  Can you fix this? Users/TerriLeonard

20120918 08:09:39 nbsp Sac river water will not make good tea

you can redeem recyclables at DWR Users/StevenDaubert

20121121 17:11:56 nbsp Thank you for your input on that page.  Its good to get another voice, and its apparently important that it be a female voice.  Since apparently the fact that there are 3ish men disagreeing with CO is a sign of sexism and oppression. Users/TomGarberson

20121121 17:16:03 nbsp I just decided to leave that conversation, but I really do appreciate the information you added.  The steak page might benefit from some of the grading information, as it covers restaurants and local suppliers.  Even just putting the basic info there might allow people to, over time, identify whats available where.  Im pondering Ethical Shopping as a starting entry (to avoid getting into the topic of food until after things are more calm).  I personally try to do a few things like avoid overpackaging, and Ill bet Im not the only one.   This general topic (being an informed consumer) strikes me as something that would be useful, isnt collected elsewhere from a local perspective, and is not really well represented on the wiki.  I think. Users/JabberWokky
  Green and Local Gift Ideas is relevant, but doesnt fully cover ethical shopping.  (And I agree with JW  thank you for chiming in).  cp
    Nice catch... I thought there was something sort of connected out there.  I just couldnt recall what it was.  Isnt there something similar for nonprofits or... another topic vaguely related?  I may be thinking of volunteer opportunities. jw
      Well, we do have NonProfit Organizations, but its just a list.  And there is local food, as I mentioned before.  cp

20121121 18:42:12 nbsp Vegetarians is what youre looking for. Users/JabberWokky

20130319 21:20:29 nbsp Judiththank you for the thoughts. No I dont live in Davis. I am, however, passioniate about Wikis and animal rights. Obviously more people then myself had concerns. I just lit the spark that brought it out for a good solid discussion. If people want to criticize me for that, Ill gladly take it. A much larger purpose is being served Users/PeteB

20130727 20:19:19 nbsp Nice catch. Users/JabberWokky

20130901 14:16:44 nbsp Not amazing.  First of all, they were not fresh, even though I was there not long after they opened... they had clearly been refrigerated.  (I dont know if they are made elsewhere and shipped?)  Second, Im a bit of a croissant snob, and these were definitely not light and flaky the way a croissant should be.  Basically, it was not much different from eating an OK but not amazing donut.  I thought they were better with cream than without.  I suppose I should add this to the page... Users/CovertProfessor

20130905 12:36:13 nbsp Thank you Judith.  I completely understand where you are coming from.  I found the comments to be inappropriate and degrading to others.  Is there any way to clear  any page of derogatory comments like that?  Id hate for someone from Sacramento or Woodland to visit this page and see a comment like this.  It really offends me and Im fairly certain it would offend them, since some of the employees are from Woodland and Sacramento. Users/AjayHira

20130926 08:28:14 nbsp That is very fine by me, Judith, well leave the wish list alone and let dust descend on it. Its charming, right! :) Users/ConstantiaOomen

20130926 08:46:46 nbsp Thank you for your feedback. Users/PeteB

20130926 09:34:23 nbsp There was a little discussion with CP over the Wish list (as you know)  God knows I like(d) him  and he was acting funny: edgy. I just had this idea to brush up the Wish page a little. I said, to lighten up the whole situation, because he was irritated: Whats up, Doc? just trying to make peace, and suddenly, the next day, he deletes his own page. And now I am the big bad guy? I think theres more to this. Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131221 22:26:56 nbsp have you checked out Ocean Fish and Chips in Sac ( http://www.oceanfishandchips.net/ )? Its legit... Users/MikeyCrews

20140210 18:25:15 nbsp Because people dont read it since it not only has weak content, its in a dying medium. Who is going to pay to advertise in that? But when you can force students to pay for it, like AggieTV or a whole bunch of other unused products and services on campus, who cares if it doesnt raise its standards? Users/hankim

20140216 01:10:18 nbsp some solid gnomeage recently. Thanks
