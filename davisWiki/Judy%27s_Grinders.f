20070303 11:48:03 nbsp Ive eaten here a couple of times.  The selection of food is amazing, and everything Ive tried has been decent (not great, but decent).  The ambience of the place is kind of depressing though.  Last time I went they had old pictures of food that were dusty and looked like they were from the 80s.  Not appetizing.  But Ill go back occasionally just to try something different on the extensive menu. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070304 11:30:48 nbsp I went there once when I was a kid and had the best damn pastrami burger Ive ever had. Users/BradBenedict

20070518 12:15:17 nbsp I eat in woodlant every day since I work at Seminis now, and they have the largest menu selection I have ever seen.  They have the seafood menu of London Fish and Chips, the fallafel and gyro menu of Ali babas, they also have tons of grinders (subs), burgers, cheesesteaks and Chicken items.  Its absolutely insane, but prepare yourself for a 20 minute wait on your food. Users/AllanRae

20131106 13:06:04 nbsp I just had lunch at the Judys Grinders in Davis and that is the last time.  The burger was lousy and two tables were served before me.  I had to ask a server to check on my order and she said that they couldnt find it.   There were only five tables in the restaurant and there was no reason to make this kind of error.

 Seriously? You go to a restaurant on the first (or second?) day after its opening and you post a bad review? All restaurants deserve at least a couple of weeks to work out the kinks. Users/ScottLay

20131110 21:08:40 nbsp I ate here last night at around 5 oclock. Restaurant wasnt very busy. I didnt have any problems with the service, besides the guy at the register forgetting to give my friend his beer right when he ordered (He went up and asked and got it then). The food itself was solid and came out pretty quickly. I had the pastrami burger and enjoyed it. The fries werent spectacular, but came out  hot and crispy, which is better than a lot of places can do. Ill definitely come back to try out some different things on the menu. Also, be warned, the burgers, sandwiches, subs, etc dont come with fries unless theyre one of the specials on the board; thats definitely a downside, especially with a modest portion of fries costing $3 extra.

20131216 11:21:03 nbsp I visited the E Street location and was unimpressed. First, the cashier got my order wrong. I ordered with my girlfriend, who got a sandwich (by itself, with water). I then ordered a bleu cheese and guacamole burger, also just with water. The cashier got my girlfriends order right, but strangely charged me for a #4 burger combo (which comes with fries and a drink, for an extra $2). He also carelessly overcharged two other friends who were there, assuming (without asking) that they wanted the combo deal. Second, the cashier didnt ask how I wanted the burger cooked. It came out mediumwell. Maybe thats just the default at Judys, but most places charging $7+ for a burger cook it to order.


The place wasnt busy and the location has been open and running for more than a month, so they dont have an excuse for poor service. I expect it to be out of business within 6 months (just like Huong Lan Sandwiches and Luigis before them  this storefront is a true revolving door). My burger was good, but Davis already has several good burger options.  Users/AndrewDay

20131218 21:05:48 nbsp I tried their fish and chips tonight.  Two pieces of fish were about half an inch square by six inches long, battered and fried to dark brown.  The fish had almost no moisture left, which made me sad.  The platter came with fries, three battered/fried green beans, and a side salad.  Salad: spring mix, raw yellow summer squash, red onions, raw mushrooms (cut thick and browning badly), sliced pickled peperoncini, shredded carrots, black olives, underripe tomato, and a couple bits of bell pepper.  It was trying really hard to look nice, but the middle of December is just not the time for raw summerseason salad veggies.  Coleslaw would have been more successful, or Japanesestyle pickles.

De Veres has much nicer fish and chips.  Dumpling House has reasonable fish and chips, too.  Plutos has WAY nicer salad. Users/JudithTruman

20131221 22:54:42 nbsp Service was fine for me, food was ok, and I dont like writing neighsayer reviews, but Im just not sure how this place is going to survive in this location unless they offer some serious discounts. Their Cheeseburger with fries and tax but excluding tip and drink is around $11 making it one of the more expensive in Yolo County. I cant see a situation where I want to pay top dollar for a welldone burger. Maybe Plainfield Station but thats a little cheaper and also provides a unique experience. Users/MikeyCrews

I just went to Judys grinder for the first time. I got one of the larger burgers so it was $9 but it was really good. They look huge & are pretty tasty. Also multiple friends of mine noted how cheap the bottle beers were, with decent selection as well! Daubert


An update. Went again. Found out the shakes are amazing. The Reuben was good, a little small but good. Daubert

20140120 15:14:58 nbsp Just ate there.  I was a bit apprehensive after reading comments disparaging the Davis location, but I had already made plans to meet there with a friend.  All I can say is, it was delicious.  Had the Texas Gold Burger, friend had a bunless burger, his son had a reuben.  We all left happy and satisfied.  Service was quick, everything cooked perfectly.  It was worth the price.  I really dont know what people are complaining about...if its related to a new restaurant getting its footing, thats one thing, you need to cut some slack, but my experience was not what others have been posting here.  So many businesses have come and gone at that location, Id like to see someone do well there, and I think this place can make it happen.

20140124 13:27:39 nbsp Its a bit pricey, but its a lot better than Burgers and Brew with their stale buns. The fries are a lot better here, too. Theyre not overcooked like B&Bs. INNOUT is a better than these burgers, but sometimes you want something heftier or you want different flavors (they have tons of options). 4/5 stars, minus 1 star for cost. Users/UCD4Me

20140209 15:01:13 nbsp I have been here several times, once to watch the 49ers get trounced by the Seahawks. This place is a secret place to watch sports when the graduate is packed). We have tried a variety of items, essentially all of which are distinctly mediocre, but large portions are a plus for those who want quantity over quality (which counts me out). Beer selection is OK. I predict this restaurant will follow the flock of doomed enterprises that have opened here over the past few years. I give it a year.   Users/MichaelPlotkin

20140214 10:23:57 nbsp Visited here this week for lunch.  It was about 11:30 and there were three of us waiting for service for about 5 minutes.  I ordered the Philly, Fries and a Soda which came to $11.15.  A bit on the high side but Id say the portion was large and it was well made.  Inside was nice and the TVs and beer selection were also good.  They didnt seem to have any happy hour specials which would make this much more attractive to hang out in.  The food is basically burgers, cold sandwiches and fried food.    The philly was really tasty, but it used bell peppers instead of cherry peppers and was missing the spice and acid normally found in a true Philly. The meat was good and again it was well prepared.  The fries were cooked perfect for my taste.

It wasnt very busy during the entire time I was there eating. Thats a bad sign. They need to bring folks into this place if they hope to survive.  Coupons. 2 for 1, Happy Hour specials are going to be key to drumming up business and conquering the curse of this spot.  The food was solid enough but again it was on the heavy side and I know I wont be eating here more than 1 or 2 times a month.

The pictures of food is always odd to me and especially since they have the same burger presented 2 or 3 times around the place.  Additionally they have an electronic picture of the same burger but it doesnt rotate and just stays on the same photo.  Not sure thats a good thing.  Customer service needs to improve a bit.  The incredibly noisy hand cart they use to truck food into from their shopping trips needs to be oiled.  Maybe turn the TVs to a few different shows instead of all showing the same thing.  Id give it a 6.5 out of 10 probably overall.   Users/loneshark
