 About me 
 My ride 
Amanda, my 91 Kawasaki Ninja EX500, has been quite good to me, and did quite well at my first trackday in September 07.
 My other rides 
I won (nearunanimously, sigh) Biggest Busnerd at the last employee awards meeting.  Um, and the one before that.  Its probably because I had a ton of jobs and am a huge dork.  I used to be a Driver, DoubleDeck Driver, OutofTownCharter Driver, DriverConductor, Assistant DriverTrainer, OutofTownCharter Trainer, Tipsy Taxi Driver, and Tipsy Taxi Dispatcher.

 My learnins 
I majors majored in Linguistics with a minor in Spanish.  Thank god for gradumacating!  But its off to grad school soon for that Ph.D in Linguistics.
 My babies 
I was the proud (surrogate) parent of 5 little ratties.  I used to have 5 total, but they had to be put down due to a combination of old age and/or illness, sniff.  They were like my childrens, and they were all brothers from the same litter.  They will always be missed:
  Nyx         (1/19/041/9/06)
  Bandit      (1/19/045/19/06)
  Gus         (1/19/045/31/06)
  ButtButt  (1/19/046/3/06)
  Pidge       (1/19/0411/11/06)

 Miscellany 
I also like Strong Bad and HSR (if you couldnt catch from the above reference).

Oh, and Epic Quad Battle kicked ass.  GO SOUTH!  We didnt just win, we SO won.  )  Two years running, too.

 My unknown skizzles 
  Random Fact:  I drew Orion, the bus cartoon, emphasizing my massive dorkdom.  Look for the Uni Tshirts with a similar design, but sporting a new dirty slogan for Unitrans.
   Id really like a unitrans shirt, could you tell me when they will be available? Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger
    I dont think theyre available to the general public or anything; hell, there was a goof and I havent even gotten my own yet.  P
    UPDATE: yes! finally got a sweatshirt!

 Basically... 
I am a dork.  But a dork who likes beer, video games, and motorcycles. D
