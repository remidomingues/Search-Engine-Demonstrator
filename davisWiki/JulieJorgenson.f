20111017 10:11:05 nbsp no problem Julie.  Happy to help.  I dont know if you remember me or not, but I got involved in FBC lighthouse towards the end of the year you were the intern there (my senior year of high school).   You may remember my wife, who was involved throughout jr high and high school.  Glad to see you are doing well and starting what I hope will be a rewarding career for you.  Good luck!

This is such a small world; its great to catch up with you!  I see from your profile that you are now a UC Davis Law student  congratulations!  Grad school can be such an exciting  and draining  time . . . I hope you are doing well and enjoying this season of life!!

20111017 10:32:00 nbsp I married Shabnam Tavatli (now Shabnam Dietrich).  Do you remember her? Users/ChrisDietrich

20111017 10:35:42 nbsp Of course!  Its so exciting that you two are married!!  That news makes my heart glad :)

Please say hello to Shabnam for me.  If youre still at FBC, Ill keep an eye out for you both next Sunday.  I would love to say hi in person! Users/JulieJorgenson

20111110 13:25:39 nbsp Hey, I am curious as to why you deleted the two entries.  My main concern is the Miscarriage Support Group, as it seems like such an important service to the community.  If its still meeting, it should probably still exist, or if its no longer around, it should probably be converted to a historical entry to document the history of Davis.  However, given the nature of the group, there may be a reason such that it being gone for a short time might make sense out of compassion and/or tact.  If its something relatively mundane, however, I think it would be helpful to know why the entry was deleted.  And, if it wasnt obvious, I have great respect for you in fostering such an important group for the community. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20111219 15:18:58 nbsp Evan  Thank you very much for your note and your support!! I was relocating my practice and, while I was briefly between supervisors, I had to remove all marketing and advertising materials to comply with the legal and ethical standards for my profession. Now that Im settled in my new placement, Im resurrecting my presence on Davis Wiki :)

With regard to the Miscarriage Support Group, based on demand and feedback, I have decided to expand into the Pregnancy Loss Support Groups in order to provide a place for those going through not only miscarriage but also other sorts of pregnancy loss, including fetal demise and stillbrith.  I have gone ahead and created a page for the Pregnancy Loss Support Groups on Davis Wiki.

I hope this info helps!  If you have any other questions or concerns, please dont hesitate to contact me.

Thanks again! Users/JulieJorgenson
