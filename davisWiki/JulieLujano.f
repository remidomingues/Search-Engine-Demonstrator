Julie graduated from UC Davis during Winter quarter 2006.

She recently returned from Australia  at the end of May 2007, where she attended the International Scholar Laureate Programs Delegation on Journalism.  She learned a lot, and met some wonderful people there.  While attending UCD, Julie decided to broaden her horizons by studying abroad for an entire school year.  She left for London, England in Septemer 2004, and returned to California in June 2005 (of course she DID come home for Christmas and Easter). While in England, Julie lived and studied at Royal Holloway University of London (RHUL), in Egham, Surrey.  She regards it as one of the  best times of her life.

During her UCD Stint, Julie was a member of the University Chorus and the University Chamber Singers UC Davis Chambers Singers.  She enjoys music, poetry, writing, and her adorable nephew, Santiago.
