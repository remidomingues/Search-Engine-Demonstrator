20070612 18:33:07 nbsp The Luau @ Larrys protest sounds like it is in REALLY poor taste. Events like that do much more damage to your cause than you can possibly imagine. In the end Im sure you are generating more opposition among people who otherwise would have let this run its course. You wont see them on the street protesting against you, but they will be making phone calls, writing letters and having lunch with decision makers. Users/JasonAller

20070613 01:33:25 nbsp so its poor taste to let the party guests know that the workers serving them food arent being treated fairly by the university?  and that their very host is the one person actually able to rectify the situation?  i disagree  raising the awareness of people in attendance at such an event spreads the message of this campaign.  of course everyone wont agree; were not trying to change every single persons mind.  were just trying to achieve affordable healthcare, union representation, and higher wages for these people who work AT the university and yet are kept OUT of the university community.  to do that, we need to change larrys mind.  and embarassing him at his home is one means to that end.

I dont believe he is disagreeing with your message, merely finding that your mannerisms lack social grace and etiquette. Though it may spread your message, do you have the right to be so disrespectful to this man? I dunno, it just seems a bit poor taste, I mean on the same level of poor taste as the rot the DCs serve daily. ~DavePoole

20070613 18:13:09 nbsp i have no desire to be graceful.  havent yall ever heard the line wellbehaved women seldom make history??  i want to stir shit up  its only by bucking the status quo that change ever happens.  by contrast, letting this run its course, as jason suggests, supports the current power structure.  Larry Vanderhoef makes well over $300,000 a year (or $144 per hour) while the people serving the food at his party receive poverty wages and health care plans that are completely unaffordable.  THAT is in poor taste!  and the guests at Larrys party, as well as the family and friends of graduating seniors visiting Davis this week, deserve to know about this injustice that is occurring right beneath their noses.

that said, shouldnt this discussion be on the Students Organizing for Change site since its under their purview that i posted the luau information? Users/JulieSetele

20080207 14:22:59 nbsp Hi Julie,
We tried to download the DPFS pdf last night and it worked just fine. Im not sure why it didnt work for you.

are you going to do anything on March 19th? Im going to SF. I tallied the number of deaths per day for the last 5 years (although weve been bombing Iraq for 19 years) and it comes out to almost 500 per day. that really really sucks.
