This Memorials memorial Address(Benches bench, 38.571022, 121.748925) for Julie Partansky was recently placed on the main viewing platform of the North Area Pond within the Covell Greenbelt.  Its view is somewhat obstructed by the platform railing, but it provides an otherwise great place to rest and reflect on our former Mayor, a quintessentially Davis personality.
