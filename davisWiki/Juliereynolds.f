20120429 15:58:55 nbsp Hi, welcome to the wiki! You might notice I changed the language on the massage institute page back to third person.  This is because 1) The wiki cannot be used as a promotional tool for businesses and 2) the institutes page belongs to the community, and therefore should be in third person rather than first person.  I just wanted to clarify wiki policies for you.  Have a lovely day! Users/LoriOrf
