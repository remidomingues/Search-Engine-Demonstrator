20081009 12:51:06 nbsp Hi Julius, welcome to the wiki. I notice these are your first edits to DavisWiki; have you spent a lot of time on here before? This event is in Texas, far away from Davis, CA. Is there a local connection/relevance?  Users/ElleWeber

20081009 13:12:09 nbsp Howdy Julius.  I apologize if Ive deleted it in error, but as there isnt any apparent connection to Davis, I removed the event from the event calendar.  You might want to check out the wiki:wikispot:Wiki Directory for a closer wiki (or start one for your area!).  If I was wrong, please feel free to readd the event, although you might want to make it clear as to why people from Davis would specifically be interested. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
