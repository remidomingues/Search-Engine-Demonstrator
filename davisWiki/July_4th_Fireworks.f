Every 4th of July the city of Davis puts on a fireworks display in Community Park (roughly around F and 14th streets). The fireworks begin around 9:30pm, culminating a day of festivities. There is also skydiver just before sundown, usually from Skydance skydiving



The Public Skate Park is usually closed as soon as the sun goes down because the large overhead lights will be disabled. Also note, that while most of the time one is not required to wear a helmet in the skate park, police give out tickets to those who dont wear them on this day.

The California Aggie also has articles on the holiday in its online archives, but Cal Aggie feacaps on the holiday are only available in print.

Dos Coyotes is usually a major sponsor of this event

During 2010, due to construction at Davis High School, there were be a few changes. Here is the information from http://cityofdavis.org/cs/events/july4.cfm their website:

Community Park lawn seating and the location of the entertainment stage will change this year as a result of construction work at the Davis High School football and track stadium.  The fireworks launch site will be moved away from the stadium so that fireworks fallout does not affect the all weather track and field.  As a result, the grass seating area  west of the Community Park bike path will be smaller in 2010.  The entertainment stage will move from its traditional location near the oak tree to the northwest corner of the Community Park main soccer field.  The parking lot along Covell Boulevard next to Community Park will be closed to the public and used for Fourth of July entertainers and event support.

  Definitely the park. You wouldnt be able to see them well (or at all) from campus because thats pretty far away. I live a block away from the park and we can see them from our driveway, but we usually walk down to the park to watch. Bring a chair or a blanket and hang out for a while! Users/JenniferCook
