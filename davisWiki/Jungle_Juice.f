This is a Alcohol drink you can make when youve got a whole houseload of people and a limited budget.  There are many, many variations on this drink including the counterintuitively delicious addition of vanilla ice cream.  Below is one recipe for 20 gallons of the good stuff.  But beware, this drink can kill.

  1 liter of Everclear alcohol
  5.25 liters (or 3 x 1.75 liter bottles) of vodka
  1 bottle of peach schnapps
  1 pint of rum
  1 bottle of apple schnapps
  10 liters of Sprite or 7Up
  1 liter of orange juice
  1 liter of triple sec
  1.75 liters of gin
  1 bottle of Sour Apple Pucker schnapps
  4 bottles of Boones Strawberry Hill wine
  8 liter of fruit punch soda (e.g. Hawaiian Punch)
  2 containers of orange juice concentrate
  fruit (slice it, dice it, and add as much as desired)

Now, youre wondering, how am I supposed to store twenty gallons of this stuff?!  Well, in a trashcan, of course.  Clean a 20+ gallon trashcan out very well and line it with several clean heavyduty trashbags.  Come on, lighten upor buy a new trashcan for the occasion if your old one is too dirty.  I guess you could use a large fish tank as well, but please remove the fish first.  While ice cream may add a pleasantly palatable surprise to jungle juice, dead goldfish do not.

Now, you can imagine that this recipe is intended for parties that will remain in one place.  Unlike a Forties 40, or I suppose a Kegs keg, no matter how many people are lending a hand, its just not easy to run down the street while lugging a trashcan full of jungle juice.  And yes, it will probably stain your carpets.

For the sake of improvement on things that are already good, please add your variations or tips to this page.
