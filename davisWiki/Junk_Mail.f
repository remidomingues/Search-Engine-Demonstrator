Davis residents receive a large amount of junk mail.

 Optout 

Some of this is mailed, other publications are delivered to home driveways. Rather than throw this directly into the recycle, perhaps we can opt out of receiving the junk mail in the first place. Save trees, save energy, etc.  It may be a good idea to actually look through the junk mail as it is filled with many Discounts and Freebies coupons.

 Other options 

If a particular item was sent First Class, the recipient may mark that item as Refused and expect that it will be returned to sender with additional postage due.  Many senders will clue in to the fact that you dont want their crap.  If its Bulk or Standard, then youre still entitled to mark an item as Refused but it will only cost the Post Office money  the sender will never know.

For reference, see the USPS Domestic Mail Manual section DMM300, Recipient Options:  Refusal After Delivery at http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/508.htm#wp1044866
