Jupiters Beard (Centranthus ruber), is also referred to as Keys to Heaven or Red Valerian, and is a flowering perennial with fragrant, domeshaped clusters of small darkpink or white flowers atop 2 to 3foot stems. It grows equally well in bright shade to full sun and blooms from late spring to mid summer. A member of the Valerianaceae family, centranthus originally comes from the Mediterranean region like many other plants which do so well in Davis. Jupiters beard is also droughtresistant enough to be used in watersaving xeric landscape designs. As beautiful as it is durable, Jupiters beard sports bluegreen lanceshaped foliage on smooth stems in opposite pairs. Each stem bears dense terminal clusters of electric, rosered flowers throughout the growing season  it is easy to see why centranthus is sometimes know as scarlet lightning. Though it easily adapts to either dry or moist soil, occasional watering promotes heavy blooming. As flowers begin to fade, plants should be pruned back to the main clump of foliage to promote continuous blooming and keep the plant compact. Flower heads left on the plant will self seed easily in moist soil, but new starts can be easily plucked; because it selfseeds so freely and blooms with such frequency, Jupiters Beard can be considered invasive.
