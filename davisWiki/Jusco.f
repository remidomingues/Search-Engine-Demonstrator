Is NOW OPEN as of 101711, after being closed for the summer of 2011 for remodeling.


Jusco is a sushi buffets buffet restaurant that probably has the most polarized reviews of all the restaurants in Davis. The good news for Jusco is most of the bad reviews were in years past, while the recent reviews overall are much more positive and note improvement in food, atmosphere and service  you may wish to scroll to the bottom of the reviews first.  Everyone seems to agree that it is conveniently located downtown across the street from Fujis, and that there is never a problem finding a table, but the agreements end there. Many people think that the quality is highly questionable. These people complain about overly salted food, sushi that smells really fishy, and poor service. Others seem to like the variety, especially the cooked items. People especially recommend their tasty selection of fried snackables (eg. salt & pepper prawns, calamari). They tend to serve their sushi rice warm and very light on the vinegar; some customers like this as a sign of authenticity, while others think it makes the sushi taste less fresh.

As for the service, although the old man is quite nice, some of the servers are known to forget orders, and allegedly say offensive things about their customers in Cantonese. A few patrons often feel like they are being watched to make sure they eat every grain of sushi rice from their nigiri, since leaving behind a lot of rice will result in extra charges (This is meant to prevent people from making sashimi out of the nigiri). Overall, this is the place to go if you find yourself downtown and want a sushi buffet without having to wait in line for a table, dont want to have to pick your food up from sushi boats, or dont want your food to have been sitting under heat lamps.

Also, you get a free meal on your birthday with a party of four. (Until 2013 it was a party of two.) By way of comparison, you need five paying adults to get a free meal on your birthday at Davis Sushi Buffet.

This place used to be the Davis Saloon Vietnamese Restaurant.

20090130 17:15:08 nbsp Oh my god, I love this place, they have amazing sushi rolls, compares to FUJI, Jusco has more variety of rolls, and sashimis, and other hot food as well. People who work there are very friendly. Users/meiwu

20090208 18:46:58 nbsp So today was my first time eating at Suhi Nobu. After going to Juscos about 100 times with friends and family(and absolutely loving it), and reading reviews of the all you can eat sushi places in Davis, I was surprised to see that Juscos was at the bottom of the list. I thought to myself, How can this be possible? Is their really a place better than Juscos? Seeing that Sushi Nobu was considered the best sushi place in Davis, I decided to try it out. So today, I got up with a couple of my friends who have been to Juscos, and went to Sushi Nobu for lunch. At Juscos you sit at a booth and order whatever you want, here you just went up and got sushi from the bar. After my friends and I sat down with our Sushi and took our first bites, we all looked up at each other with that Are you kidding me? face. The sushi was bland, and flavorless. It was room temperature, and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. The rice was mushy, and the sushi looked sloppily put together. After several trips to get more sushi from the bar, we were all very very disappointed. There was no comparison, Juscos blew this place out of the water in every way(besides the fact that this place had a big screen t.v.) I feel like I just wasted my money.  If you have never gone to Juscos, or havent been their in a while, I sincerely recommend going there sometime soon and giving it a try. Ive heard that Juscos didnt get the greatest reviews back in the day, but is getting better ones now. Maybe thats why theyre not packed 24/7. But everyone Ive taken there (about 30 different people, including a friend from Japan), have all agreed that Juscos is the best all you can eat sushi they have ever had. GO TRY JUSCOS! Im about to go right now and spend money I dont have to go get some, as this morning was horrible... Lol. Users/Austen

20090210 10:39:20 nbsp I love Jusco! Ive converted many to the cause, and since Im an equal opportunity eater, Ive tried nearly every other sushi place in Davis. They all pale in comparison to the sheer awesomeness of this place. Great selection, great food, great service. They have frequent buyer cards now; theyre trying to keep them a secret, but if you ask for one theyll produce it. Users/HannahReff

20090228 01:04:01 nbsp Me and my friends went here for the first time tonight. The staff was courteous, and most of their dishes were very fresh. I actually like all of the sesame seeds they put on the sushi rolls. The downside is that some of our orders came slowly so we ended up ordering much more than we needed and ended up with a lot of extras. The management was nice and allowed us to take it to go for an extra charge... and good because I hate wasting food. So it was good, but the wait for the food isnt. Also... their wonton soup broth was particularly salty for some reason.  Users/MichVan

20090228 08:53:02 nbsp Ive been here twice. The first time, the service was slow. It took an hour to get our last order, at which point we said screw it and left. The second time, we got everything we ordered in under 5 minutes, every time. In terms of the sushi, everything is tasty.

In short, the service is sometimes horrendous. When it isnt, its a pretty decent place to go. Users/WilliamLewis

20090302 23:17:09 nbsp They dont seem to be able to accommodate large crowds of customers. They seat lots of people, which is great, but thats simply to get people seated, I went February 28th with my cousin, and Ive been here so many times and I keep returning, despite the fact that all my friends love every OTHER sushi place in Davis other than Juscos, but the service was GOD AWFUL. They hired some new girl and my cousin and I gave her our sheet after filling it out. 20 minutes later she returned with a new sheet asking us if we wanted to order more, even though our previous order NEVER CAME???? We told her that we already put in an order, and she went to go check, and returned saying she had lost our order????? That would explain why I saw a huge plate of nigiri go to another table (perhaps they did order it.... but where was my order?), but then she became immediately ultra attentive, sadly, I felt it was way too late. I spent a grand total of just shy of 2 and a half hours with my cousin there, most of it waiting for food. Fried stuff comes out MODERATELY quick, but Im there to eat sushi. I understand that there were lots of customers, but others were not being serviced very well either, so no one was winning, and besides Jusco getting our money, they get this bad review. They have one sushi chef, the old man apparently is left to clean tables and serve fried foods, and they have that new hired girl who takes your orders (and potentially loses them and forgets things, we never got our order of squid and a whole bunch of rolls) and brings you the sushi. Awful awful awful experience, and the food was pretty mediocre at best; my cousin was under the impression that I was grossed out like he was about their salmon, and was shocked when I ordered more. Hey, Im paying the money, might as well try to enjoy myself... even if it taste kind of bad... Why have us write down what we want if you are going to forget stuff? Should we just tell you? Save money on some markers? Users/CoreyPham

20090319 18:20:47 nbsp Been here three times for the sushi buffet. First time I was here, I went here with friends... service was horrendous. We did not get all of our food; we left Jusco feeling very unsatisfied. But the second and third time, service was great. The food came relatively quickly and without incident (we werent left hanging, waiting for the rest of our food). The sushi here is decent, though I wish they werent so stingy about the sashimi (only one order per person per meal). I will probably come back here for lunch sometime soon, however; its reasonably priced! Users/sugarpop
 The trick for the sashimi thing is to drag along sushi n00bs who arent daring enough to try sashimi. Then you get to eat their order... om nom nom. Although truth be told, 50Â¢ for four extra slices isnt that bad. Ive been known to pay extra for more if their sashimi is especially good that day. wl

20090424 11:33:49 nbsp Best restaurant ever. Best thing to do is not eat for a day or two, then go to Jusco and have an eating competition with some friends. You might be really full, but its totally worth it. The food is great, the service is great, and the prices are unbelievable for the amount of fantastic food (if I do say so myself). If you like sushi, this is the place to go. Even if youre not the biggest fan of sushi, they have good hot food on their buffet list. I love this place. I defiantly recommend it to anyone )   Users/SarahYablon
 I am confused and at a loss for words, do you work at Jusco? You said if I do say so myself, so do you make this food?  Also, I definitely defiantly recommend it to anyone also! Users/ion

20090815 22:18:24 nbsp I am 16 and i went to juscos with a party of 5 other 16 years olds...
all i had to do was show my permit and the owner was nice enough to give me a free meal on my birthday :D
I have tried other sushi places in davis: mikunis , fujii boat ,davis sushi buffet, even safeway sushi!
but those places are either overpriced for what they have to offer or just plain gross.
I always get the spider roll and dragon roll when i am on the go and want lunch, the first time i ordered pick up from them i thought it would be a little bit of sushi so i ordered both rolls, turns out i ended up sharing with like 4 people, they give a lot of sushi when you order the rolls (at least like 25 pieces) and the sauces that go on top of the sushi are excellent. I also love their miso soup. I recommend Juscos Users/lajolla4joya

20091215 13:29:50 nbsp I went there today and the sushi was not so fresh. One of my coworkers decided they did not want to eat there after trying a piece and left to go to a restaurant next door. I let the waitress know that she didnt like the food, only ate one piece and would be getting lunch elsewhere. The waitress rudely told me that we would be paying for here nonetheless. I tried to ask her why we should pay when she ate only one piece, but she just repeated that we would be paying and stormed off. When we went to leave she was insisting that we pay for the extra person. I again tried to ask why it made sense to pay full price when they only ate one piece of fish. She just kept telling me I had to pay. I asked to speak to the manager. After speaking to him and explaining everything, he agreed and did not charge us. The waitress was visibly upset by this and again stormed away. Talk about bad customer service. We will not be eating here again! Users/scevec

20091225 03:34:30 nbsp I say this a lot, but you really get what you pay for. The sushi here is noticeably cheaper quality than other restaurants, but still tasty and fresh as to be expected with sushi in general. The service was pretty quick so I barely missed sitting at a bar and just snatching things up as I do at Fuji. I ate from the usual weekday lunch menu so while a lot of the rolls seemed a little samey, I quite enjoyed it (and it was definitely a bargain at $11... particularly considering that Im quite capable of racking up a $60 bill by myself at certain other restaurants). It is a little small, but I actually liked that. It made it a really nice place to have lunch with the bff and chatter away without feeling like I was yelling across a table. No outstanding negatives here. Users/KBathory

20100108 15:20:08 nbsp Juscos is my favorite place to get the all you can eat sushi, and I think they have amazing service! I love the man who comes to take your order. The free buffet on your birthday is awesome, and I think they have pretty high quality food for good prices. Plus the candy you get with your bill is really tasty, too! Definitely go here for the buffet. Users/emmaleanne

20100126 12:39:56 nbsp Im a current second year at Davis and a big fan of sushi. Coming from the Bay Area I am used to good quality sushi. Having tried each all you can eat sushi place in Davis, I feel that for its price
Jusco is worth it. For 15$ on weeknights, you are able to get a variety of good sushi thats freshly made. While people say Fujis is the best, Fujis is always crowded, noisy, and their sushi sits out on the boats for periods of time. While Jusco does put a limit to the amount of sashimi, Jusco is obviously a roll oriented place. Their rainbow and dragon rolls are mouth watering fireworks that melt in your mouth with each bite.  And for the people that say the staff is bad, in all of my experience, Jusco has the best staff. Jusco seems to be family run, with the main servers being either a young asian male or a older asian male. Though the older asian male is hard to understand, the constant smile on his face is reason enough to pick Jusco over other sushi joints. The young asian male is always hospitable, constantly checking up on us to see how the sushi is and if wed prefer to order more or if we were done. Ontop of this if we ever were unable to finsh the last few sushi rolls, the staff is more ten happy to box up our remaining rolls for us to take home. On top of all of these things, the calamari is awesome. my review is done, and now i will head to Jusco for dinner. no joke! Users/kretiveham

20100130 15:36:58 nbsp I waited twenty minutes until they brought one of my sushi plates.  Ridiculous.  I proceeded to wait ten more minutes until my next order.  Maybe I was irritated because I was hungry and wanted food, but afterwards they began to speed up with my ordered food and I was okay.  One of the servers is an old guy who is nice, however I couldnt really understand him.  Inexpensive, but good sushi over all.  I would come back if I was really hungry/craving sushi. Users/strawberry

20100216 19:35:26 nbsp Being someone who gives second chances, I came back the following week.  The nice old man recognized me, even remembering I liked eel sauce with my meal.  He also brought a glass and pitcher of water after taking my order.  The food came immediately after... within five minutes or so.  It was very tasty and I left satisfied.  I will come back here again. Users/strawberry

20100318 10:14:08 nbsp Really really bad. The only redeeming thing about Juscos is that the old man who works there is really nice. I feel like these good reviews are fake because Ive been there twice and both times they put this gross sauce on EVERYTHING. It made me feel really sick. I gave it a second chance but that will never happen again. Users/Simchild

  What sauce? Ive been here quite a few times and the quality is very good for a buffet and not everything came with a sauce. And they do make everything right there, so I am pretty sure you could ask for things to come without sauce. Users/hankim
  Strong accusations from a oneoff account without a real name on it, used solely to criticize one restaurant... Users/JoePomidor

20100322 22:00:23 nbsp i came here with a friend once, it was DELICIOUS! and the old man was very friendly! I went to fujis once and im not a huge fan of sushi boats nor a lot of mayo, but Juscos hit the spot. They also have lots of vegetarian options. My friend was vegan and found a ton of things to eat! The fried tofu was AMAZING!!!!! Users/Vero

20100404 00:22:51 nbsp The only negative about this place is the decor. Other than that, they have delicious food that is individually made to order and friendly service. Also, the staff actually being japanese is somewhat of a plus towards authenticity ahem davis sushi buffet. Users/kiddmit3

 I agree with Jusco being the best Sushi Buffet in town, however, the staff is definitely Cantonese and not Japanese. Users/AlvinTsao
  Haha, true. I honestly think that its weird when people make comments about the owners or operators of restaurants with respect to the food. I dont need a British person to sell me Mermaids Seafood & Grill fish and chips, or an Italian person to serve me Caffe Italia pasta. Its very much possible to get quality food that is not made by a person of the same ethnicity as the food. Users/JoePomidor
  That doesnt mean the food wont be good, but I think theres just a homely feel about it if it came from a family where that kind of food is a specialty. Oh and i didnt know they were Cantonese.  Users/kiddmit3
   Oh, I know what you mean.  Coming from an American family myself, I often wish I could specialize in more than just battering and deepfrying the hell out of everything.  But lets be honest, the art of sushi is just another one of those unfathomable mysteries of the Orient.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20100404 23:13:25 nbsp Ive eaten here a few times, so its probably time for a review.  The sushi wasnt bad per se  it just wasnt as good as Fujis or Davis Sushi.  Ive experienced very long waits for sushi here  up to half an hour or more, even when the restaurant wasnt crowded.  Jusco is all you can eat, which is good.  But they really restrict what you can eat.  If you are a sashimi fan, you may be disappointed because you can only order a small amount of sashimi (at least without being charged extra above the all you can eat price).  You also have to be very careful about what you order, because they will charge you if you leave over rice but eat the fish!  So, you have to guess up to half an hour in advance what you will be hungry for.  Youll want to order more because it takes so long to get the sushi.  But you wont want to order too much because then theyll charge you for having some left over!  Of course, if you do go over, you can overstuff yourself on the rice, but that isnt very healthy.  :(  On the plus side, they do have quite a variety of sushi here, so you are pretty likely to find something that appeals to you.

Jusco is a bit on the cramped side too.  Two small people can fit on the same bench in their booths. Two larger people may have a lot of trouble doing so.

On the IDoNotExist SushiMeter(TM), Jusco rates a 4/10 for the sushi, and a 3/10 for the service and rules. Users/IDoNotExist

20100528 13:09:40 nbsp I LOVE Jusco! They have great tasting Sushi (although I dont have the most discriminating taste palette, it either taste horrible or taste great to me...) and have EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE. Very nice, a pleasure to do business with, I think their service is fantastic and leagues above other Davis Sushi joints. When me and my girlfriend have Sushi cravings, we always try our best to go to Jusco because we know they serve great Sushi and they treat their customers right. Again, excellent service!

Thanks Jusco! Users/joneric

20100530 22:00:46 nbsp After dining at each of the four Davis sushi buffets at least twice, my wife and I decided Jusco is our favorite. The quality of the food has always been good. They have the widest variety of rollssome other places, it seems like 90% have shrimp tempura, which gets old fast. The Jusco staff has been courteous and friendlyother places have made us feel rushed or ignored, or even made us feel like were imposing by dining there. Users/BrianNeal

20100707 20:06:08 nbsp My friends and I love coming here to stuff ourselves with sushi. All of its delicious, and the hot food is great too.  Users/Bobalice

20100721 11:30:39 nbsp This place is amazing. My friend and I stumbled upon it one random afternoon in Davis, and only went here because it was the only place left open at the time we went (~2:30 pm). We were slightly put off by the decor of the place, but the old man was extremely friendly, even though he can barely speak English. He was extremely hospitable. Obviously the thing to get here is the AYCE, and for lunch, its like $11 + tax, how can you go wrong? For the price, the sushi isnt the greatest Ive ever had, but it is definitely not bad at all and better than all of the other sushi places Ive gone to in Davis. My friend, who is a sushi fanatic, was extremely surprised by the quality and liked the place alot. Weve come back numerous, numerous time since then, sometimes twice in one day, and have been extremely happy with our experiences there. We will continue to go to Jusco as long as they are open.

The only complaint I would have is that it sometimes takes a long time for the orders to come out of the kitchen, since they make it once you order it instead of having it already made on one of those boats. It sucks because youll have already ordered once, and youll be hungry for a little more and order as such, but by the time the second order comes out, youre no longer hungry and if you dont eat the sushi, youre charged for it. Otherwise, I have no other complaints about Jusco.

Miso soup is good, as well as the Red Dragon, 69, and 007 Rolls. Fried wontons are good too.

Love this place. Users/Alkasquawlik

20100816 14:28:26 nbsp Ive been going to Jusco since I moved here two years ago, and Ive consistently gotten good service and tasty food.  I like that I can order off the menu rather than having to pick from the sushi boats.  The tobiko (roe) with quail egg is great.  It took a second to get used to eating raw egg, but it soaks right into the rice and is really delicious.  The mackerel sashimi is much fishier tasting than other types of sashimi, so watch out if thats not your thing. Users/DanaSullivan

20100929 23:38:34 nbsp I did not realize I did not already submit a glowing review of this restaurant, so I shall do so now.
I eat at Jusco once a week, every week  and I love it. Its my favorite restaurant in Davis.
The quality is very good (not quite as high fish quality as say Zen Toro of course  but the price and amount reflect this).
The service is great! All the wait(er/resse)s are very friendly. Also, its usually not all that full  which is great.
The price pretty much cant be beat. For $12 (posttax), you get a sushi buffet. I mean, all the sushi you can eat  for
the price of a standard size lunch dish. How AWESOME is that? In fact, its such a good price that giving them a 2530%
tip is perfectly reasonable (and fair I believe )

In short: If you havent eaten at Juscos yet  do so! You wont regret it. Users/Oleg.Lokhvitsky

20101004 16:33:08 nbsp I went to Jusco for the first time the other night, and I had mixed feelings. The service was really fabulous, and they were kind and patient even though my friend and I came in pretty late. But, I wasnt too thrilled about the quality. The nigiri was averagesized and not as good in quality as some other places around town. The price was steep for what I got. But, Id like to give Jusco another chance, perhaps for lunch. Overall, great service but average food.  Users/anna.thoma

20101006 12:20:52 nbsp There are many vegetarian/vegan options here, and being a vegan myself i really enjoy their variety of nonmeat sushi. It is not the highest quality, but the price is well worth the all you can eat sushi :) Users/aphrodite

20110302 22:13:35 nbsp I would rather go to other sushi buffets. First of all the salmon was not fresh. It was mushy and warm and tasted funky. Tobiko was good and red dragon was good though. I went there little past 9 thinking we would have a lot of time to eat since they close at 10 but they said they stop taking orders at 9:30 and they started running the VACUUM at 9:45 when we were still eating. this was not a very good experience for me and i wouldnt be returning here anymore. The server kept speaking in chinese which i did not understand at all but he was nice.  Users/littlemissbug

20110422 18:13:30 nbsp I went here for lunch with my boyfriend. I dont like seafood or sushi, he sorta dragged me here. I liked all the nonseafood items they had, though service was really slow. Also, they didnt have teryaki chicken but didnt tell me, so we sat around for a long time waiting for it to come out. I would have ordered more food in its stead had I been told they were out, but they didnt and I was tired of waiting just to have one or two more plates, so we ended up leaving. Users/AndrewJacobs

20110803 18:37:56 nbsp I guess this place is closed for remodeling now, but I feel like I have to express my gratitude to the older male waiter who served me on my birthday some months ago..better late than never i guess :p I came in for the free birthday buffet with 4 other people, and when more of my friends showed up a bit later, and then again later (there ended up being 10 of us or so), he happily pulled up more chairs and another table so we could all sit. It sounds lame but I humbled at this waiters amazing service and care for the customer. he was always smiling when he came around to wait on us. The food came out quickly and we were all very satisfied! I hope they open again soon because the free birthday buffet is an excellent idea. Users/AboveTheClouds

20110805 10:24:05 nbsp Not a review.  Just history: This and the place next door (Katmandu) used to be a Round Table Pizza.  They had the big round table (of course), video games, great place for kids.  At that time, it was bigger than Steves, so it was easier to do a birthday (or other) party at Round Table. Users/OldDavis73

20110815 20:25:48 nbsp OldDavis73, actually just Katmandu was the Round Table.  Jusco was the back of the old G Street Pub, which closed the back (the best part of the old pub) and rented it out to Jusco. Users/AlanMiller

20110825 12:45:18 nbsp Never had any complaints about the sushi or the service. I didnt expect topquality cuts of fish for $10 or $11, and the older gentleman server is among the nicest people on the planet. I sincerely hope the place reopens someday...and if they charged an extra buck or two, theyd _still_ be cheaper than Fuji. Users/ChrisVincenti

20110908 12:19:27 nbsp I talked to Calvin the head of Jusco last night.  They are remodeling, have completely wiped down the surfaces and painted, added some mirrors, reupholstered the seats (needed it!), and the door to G Street Pub was moved down to the far end of the wall more out of the way of customers as well the wall is now much thicker which should reduce the noise from the pub.  The main sticking point is the shared kitchen, as Jusco is waiting for the new diswasher for the pub to be installed.  Calvin doesnt know the exact reopening date, but my best guess is towards the end of September. Users/AlanMiller

20110909 17:58:45 nbsp Oddly, the Davis Enterprise reported on September 9th that Jusco had reopened.  When I was there on September 7th, they sure didnt look or talk like they would be open in one day, more like a week or three.  Tried calling at 6pm with no answer.  I wonder why the Enterprise reported this, they couldnt look across the street and see if the open sign was on? Users/AlanMiller

20110910 11:40:00 nbsp The place and food dont look very appealing. You get what you paid for. They also make you eat up all your food before you can order more. When you order for more food, it tends to take them much longer to prepare. Users/kkha91

20110920 11:39:00 nbsp My favorite sushi place! Food is great, price is slightly lower than other Davis sushi buffets. Sometimes the service can be a little slow but thats ok cause it gives you time to digest so you can eat more! Users/Brian.Tangney

20110929 17:07:51 nbsp I personally think they are the best sushi buffet in Davis and for that price no one can beat it. They have been remolding for over a month and half and I think that is a little ridiculous. Ive seen restaurants that are ten times bigger then Juscos get flipped over night. They must own the building because if they didnt Im sure they would be going out of business. I wish they didnt take their sweet time on remodeling because honestly Ive tried every other sushi place located in downtown Davis and elsewhere and they dont even come close. The only con about this place is if you plan on talking while your digesting your food theyll stop helping you and stop picking up your orders. Its like theyre saying you ate enough for the price now get out. You constantly have to wave your menu in the air. Users/KelseyCondor

20110930 15:32:05 nbsp Honestly, if you read a review of this place from a person that felt pressured by the staff in some reason, it is probably because the reviewer has some sort of social disorder where they perceive even the smallest bit of pressure as a slap in the face. The staff as Jusco are some of the nicest in Davis, and the old man is always a friendly smile and good service.

Yes, they take a long time to get food out. That is because they make EVERYTHING fresh. And they are a small place, they have to make things in batches, and that takes time.

The remodeling is taking a while because they are being remodeled along with Wunderbar, which has completely gutted the place. Jusco legally cannot open until Wunderbar has met certain conditions, like a working bathroom, fire inspections, etc...

Jusco Sushi is the best in town, and the Hurricane Roll they offer on the weekend nights is absolutely the best roll I have ever eaten. Users/FergusonMitchell

20111027 20:10:17 nbsp Actually dinner weeknights is 15.75 not 15.49 after they reopened...still really really amazing!!! Users/rosepetal140

20111031 21:26:38 nbsp Ate here with boyfriend and his friends who love the place.  Sadly I discovered that they are definitely using oilfish and/or escolar fish in their sushi rather than what the menu says they use. I had some uh, unpleasantness, caused only by these specific varieties of fish.  You might enjoy the food, its definitely cheap and tasty to lots of people, but now I am convinced they are so cheap because they arent using what they advertise. Users/OliviaY
 Aack.  Apparently those things are nick named exlax fish in the biz. Users/TomGarberson

20120524 15:03:18 nbsp I really want to like this place. I have returned several times hoping that the last time had just been a fluke. The variety is great, compared to the other buffets in town. But over the past few months, its been consistently bad. I cant shake the feeling that they are trying to be cheap. Little things like a Philly roll that is advertised as Salmon and cream cheese, but shows up with a giant piece of cucumber in it. A lot of the rolls have this sort of filler. Okay, I can deal with that, considering that the price for all you can eat is pretty unbeatable. But what irks me is that they tend forget to make some of the rolls that I order. I try to just order all my rolls at the very beginning, and then I end up not getting many of them. I feel like they look at my order card and assume that I wont eat it all, and to minimize waste, decide not to make some of the rolls. If I try to spread my order out, it becomes increasingly difficult to have my order card picked up. Its like theyre gauging how full you should be. Its not like I eat my only meal of the day here! I eat a normal sized meal! lol

Unless you get the older gentleman as your waiter (hes so so sweet!) you will have very cold, unwelcoming service. I wont be going back. Users/MichellePalmer

20120719 11:12:32 nbsp My favorite sushi place!

Cons: Some of the waitstaff dont speak great English, but the majority of them are fluent. You can only order one sashimi per person, additional orders are 50 cents. Nigiri is still all you can eat, though. Seating can be limited (theyre a rather small place). Different menu for lunch vs dinner and weekday vs weekend as well. Decor is a little funky, but I kind of like it.

Pros: Good food! Try the calamari, its delicious. Juscos has a great variety of food. Sashimi seems higher quality than some other places. Also, while the menu doesnt state this, you can order green tea ice cream and hand rolls. Just let waiters know. All food is made fresh, opposed to sitting on sushi boats for a while. They can order you liquor from the bar next door, as well. I also have never had a real issue with their service  they used to miss some orders sometimes when it got busy, but I havent ran into this problem since they reopened after renovations. Lots of new staff around, so I hope they remedied this issue. They were always apologetic and made sure to make me happy, though. Also, the younger gentlemen (I think he may be the owner?) is a great guy and always remembers us. Hes offered us special off menu items and is always very accommodating. Overall I think their service is great. Prices are fair.

I love the place. :) Users/Adalwolf

20130210 18:18:15 nbsp We went there with our toddler daughter on my birthday on Monday early this year. It is definitely one of my most happiest birthday suppers. Both the food and service are very good. I really enjoyed their delicious food. Sushi is fresh. Before my daughter did not like eating sushi. That was first time my daughter ate lot of sushi and hot food there. My wife enjoyed eating the hot food. I suggest they use fresher pork to make their wonton soup. The manager were so nice treating us with green tea ice cream at the end. We did not get the overwhelming feeling of eating at buffet after our dinner. That is my favorite restaurant in town. We will go back to enjoy their wonderful food and service. Great Job, Jusco Sushi!  Users/kbt

20130210 19:48:06 nbsp I dont review places in Davis very often.  But Ive been going to Jusco for over 4 years now and am confident in saying its the best Sushi Buffet in Davis.  Not only is the price better than its competitors, but the variety is vastly superior as well.  No, there are no boats that float around (which should be a plus... you have no idea how long that stuff has been floating there or how many times its been sneezed on).  The ordering system here is incredibly efficient.  The service is fast and friendly.  The food tastes great.  And the cooked food variety is superior to competitors.
Note: The lunch buffet has a shorter menu (for sushi and cooked food) than dinner.   Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20140719 16:59:20 nbsp The best AYCE (All You Can Eat) Sushi in Davis. It has a really nice price to go with the all you can eat nigiri and sushi. Probably has the best tasting salmon nigiri Ive had in Davis and Sacramento. Definitely the only AYCE suchi worth getting in Davis for its quality and selection. Davis sushi and Fujis doesnt even compare. They have a nice selection of rolls and hot foods. They offer nice hot foods such as calamari and some chicken kebab, cheese wontons, etc...

Setting: The booths are really old, cracking, and cramped. Leaning back on one booth with lean into people on the other side.

However, the biggest problem with Juscos is the service. Rolls take a LONG time to come out after putting in your order. This is the only thing stopping me from coming here every time I want to eat sushi. The wait can be so terribly long, and Ive been in some awkward times for lack of things to talk about while waiting for the sushi.

If you have the patience or bring cards or know how to keep people entertained, I would definitely recommend Juscos. Users/DanTran
