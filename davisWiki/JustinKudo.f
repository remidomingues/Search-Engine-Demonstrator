Favorite Restaurants: Im big on food, and much like a few other restaurant reviewers on here, thought Id list my picks for food.

Japanese: Zen Toro. Best sushi in Davis, for that matter, better than the dozens of sushi places in the greater Bay Area that Ive been to. Nonsushi selections are fairly good as well. Dont bother going anywhere else in Davis, except possibly Nobu Hiro.

Chinese: Wok of Flame or Hometown. Again, these two restaurants are so far above the other restaurants in Davis that Id hate to eat elsewhere. Wok of Flame is very highquality but a bit whitewashed. Hometown is more traditional chinese food from a true holeinthewall place.

Will theoretically update this someday.
