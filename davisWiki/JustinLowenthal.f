20110426 23:07:30 nbsp Thank you, Steven.  Lincoln Law School of Sacramento.  I worked for different law offices as an intern, clerk, and administrator while attending school in the evening. Users/JustinLowenthal

20110426 23:08:52 nbsp Hows business?  Things for us are finally starting to pick back up after being pretty obnoxiously slow for a long time. Users/TomGarberson

20110427 14:02:15 nbsp Hey Tom.  Things are going well enough.  It was (and still is) tough starting a new practice in this economy, but we are doing ok!  Business is picking up and my plan is to make the permanent move to Davis very soon.  Now, to find affordable housing and commercial space... Users/JustinLowenthal

20110427 14:27:47 nbsp Thats the challenge in Davis... my wife and I may well move to Sacramento once she finishes school, since its so much cheaper there. Users/TomGarberson
