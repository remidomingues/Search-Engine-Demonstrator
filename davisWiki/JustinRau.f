Justin Rau is a legend on the UC Davis track team. He ran some fantastic races in the middle of his 5 year career, but is best known for The Rod, a forgotten tradition that he turned into an art. Today Mr. Rau can be found running along the levies on the north side of town, fishing the Putah near Airport, or eating at Chipotle, an establishment he is quite fond of despite its McDonalds affiliation.
