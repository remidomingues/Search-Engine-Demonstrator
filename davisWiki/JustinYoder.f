Came to Davis 5 years ago and enjoy it thoroughly. You may have seen me with my dog Soap and possibly other dogs in tow.

Just realized that you are new to the wiki  so let me be the first person to say welcome to the wiki welcome!  And please accept my condolences about your friend.  Sorry this message is so disjointed  I read through the Recent Changes page a bit at a time.

20110707 18:17:18 nbsp What a surprise, a pretender of the homeless that chooses to bum around rather than work saying something about an issue he knows nothing about... like the fact that his B.A.C., according to police I have spoken to, which was more than twice the legal limit at the time he was hit by the train...  Nope, not another drunken idiotic death at all. Users/WesP
