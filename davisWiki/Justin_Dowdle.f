Justin Dowdle is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2013 ASUCD Election running on the NOW Slate.


 Candidate Statement 

Hello UC Davis!

My name is Justin Dowdle, I am a third year Managerial Economics major in the college of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences from Napa, California. I work at the Western Center in the spring where I TA the tractor driving class and am a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.

I am running for senate because NOW is the time to get involved! I have some great ideas that I would like to bring to the Senate table and I want to focus on getting more students involved in our student government. Itâ€™s time that we elect people who will not only accomplish what is best for the students here at UC Davis but let them know what decisions are being made.

RALLY AROUND AGGIE PRIDE
An essential part of the college experience is going to sporting events with thousands of students rooting for their fellow students. I will create rallies each quarter to showcase our 24 sports and unite students behind our athletes. I want UC Davis students to be proud to go to this university and recognize athletic accomplishments. These rallies will unite all our students and alumni into one explosive voice cheering on our athletes.


LEARN WHAT ASUCD CAN DO FOR YOU
ASUCD provides 24 services to students and has a student government that votes on legislation pertinent to everyday student life but not many people know that. I will institute an ASUCD newsletter to be sent out to all students and be posted on the ASUCD website. This newsletter will contain a brief recap of what events are going on in our units, major ways to get involved, and recap the previous senate meeting to promote transparency. I will make sure that ASUCD lets our students know how your money is coming back to you.

Remember to vote JUSTIN DOWDLE #1 and NOW #26 for ASUCD Senate and SANDSTROM / BOTTOMS for PRESIDENT and VICE PRESIDENT on February 1922 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
