The Juvenile Justice system differs from the Adult Criminal Justice system.  The adult system is criminal court.  The juvenile system is civil court.

 Diversion Programs 
Diversion programs allow 1st time offenders or youth responsible for minor crimes to be diverted away from the Juvenile Court.  Diversion can be done at anytime from initial contact by the police officer to referral by the probation officer, the prosecutor, or even the Juvenile Court Judge.  Diversion allows the child to access services without adjudication in Court.
  Davis Police Department Youth Intervention  Davis Police Departments Youth Intervention Specialist runs an inhouse youth diversion program for 1st time nonviolent juvenile offenders.
 Youth for Recovery  youth drug rehab program run by Communicare Health Center clinics. (Qualifies as a diversion program if not involving Juvenile Drug Court.)
