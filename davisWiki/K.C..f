K.C., you have read poorly and are shooting wildly. I never objected to to the interior mess, and in fact accurately reported it with approval. Also, I never haggle at thrift stores.  Users/TheTallman

20070712 13:52:42 nbsp I would have to concur with Tallman as your diatribe seemed rather vitriolic and based upon emotional appeals... Then again I think the both of you ought to seriously consider the importance of using your RealName. Users/StevenDaubert

Look, heres the straight dope I just think that waaaay too many people are being picky dicks about the poor old thrift store. Thats it.
I dont tolerate overgrown babies in any situation and, while my comments werent the most wikified or collegial, I think that people like Tallman and GrumpyOldGeek need to be put in their place every once in a while.
Nice to meet you all.
I think were going to be great friends. Users/K.C.
     Good to put a face to the name, K.C. Is your initials and that is what you go by?  Users/StevenDaubert
         20070713 17:35:05 nbsp Yes indeed. I like your rabbit. Users/K.C.
            I swear ive seen you around town  Users/StevenDaubert
