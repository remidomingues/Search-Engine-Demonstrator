If you spend time downtown or frequent any of the sushi restaurants (or IHOP guilty) youve probably seen me. Im hard to miss, with my strangelycolored hair (pink, blue, green, you name it) and exceptionally noisy group of friends. Not that I contribute to that at all.

Its my intention to give an everyday Davisites view on as many restaurants and businesses around here as I can, since one of my pet peeves is seeing people only come on here to comment when theyre upset about something. Ive seen some of the places seem to be totally crucified, while Ive honestly never had a problem, and neither has anyone that Ive spoken to! Anyway, Ill be around.<

ABOUT ME...
Name: Kain. Or it will be. Most folks call me Fluffy.
Location: IN YOUR CLOSET. No, really. North Davis, lurking behind the Marketplace.
Occupation: Hotel receptionist at La Quinta and musician for hire (viola). Professional dreamer.
Website: http://fluffyindrag.deviantart.com/ FluffyInDrag on DeviantArt   Yep. Thats the easiest place to find me. Im a longtime member and very active in the Messaging Network (dAmn).

What Im like: Noisy, goofy, every bit the eccentric. Im very friendly and absolutely thrilled to cause harmless mischief. If you see a line leading to nowhere, or a whole bunch of people pointing to the sky despite there being nothing there, I probably started it. See some dork walking around with green hair and no shoes? Yep, thats me. Come on over and say hi.
What I like: FOOD. End of story. I love to eat, love a range of foods. Expensive chocolate, cheap sushi, homemade waffles and mailordered Japanese snacks. Im also a musician with eclectic tastes, leaning toward electronica. See some dork in a crappy car dancing around to The Offspring? Yep, thats me again. Sorry my musics too loud. I must be hard of hearing. I love to draw, have interests in clothes design. Love to dress up and make up and generally troll people. Ah well.
What I dont like: Picky, unadventurous people. The sort that want kids to grow up, and grownups to act like it. Rap (sorry, just not into it!), people who glorify violence, hate, orbeing different. Kinda defeats the purpose, eh? Oh, REALLY dont like root beer. Gross. EDIT: Decided I like Rat Bastard root beer. I dont like not liking foods so I try to find a way... try try again! ;D 

School stuff: Yep, Im over at Solano. I hate driving in Sacramento, so ARC and Sac City were out, but I needed a place that had a decent music program, too. Its really only a 25 minute commute right up I80, and theres rarely any traffic at all. And since Im getting around 500 miles a tank, its not terrible on the wallet. My focus has been on music, coming from the choir and orchestra programs here in Davis, with the intention of teaching choir when all is said and done... but of late Ive been considering taking some time to be a young, indecisive person and drop it all to go to art school in Portland. Whatever.



Its good to see another person who cares less about authenticity and more on how tasty the dishes are. AlexanderHo

20090502 05:06:01 nbsp There used to be a Society of Wiki Restaurant Reviewers, would you be interested in doing something like that? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090517 00:26:37 nbsp Id be glad to hop on that boat if someone wants to get something more organized going. I plan on making a point this summer of hitting all the restaurants I can think of and getting more helpful, nonwhining reviews up for folks to take a gander at. Probably get that going in June or so. Users/KBathory

What do YOU want? Users/MasonMurray

20090519 12:56:07 nbsp Either you are very creepy on AIM or someone is on your account. Most likely w/ your stolen computer. Users/MasonMurray

20100719 01:19:31 nbsp If you need a cut, why dont you go see Casey @ Salon Blonde?  I let her do my hair in payment for fixing her computer, and while I dont really like the salon treatment (made me feel rather... well you know) I imagine shes good.  Shes been there for a couple years now.  I could get you her number if you wanted.  Users/MasonMurray

20100722 07:41:15 nbsp Sorry to hear about needing glasses.  Have you considered thinking outside the box and going for a http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/5768/699740monocle_large.jpg threeeyes look? Users/TomGarberson
  Thats brilliant! Unfortunately I already ordered my new glasses and Im not at all averse to wearing them, but I may just take a look at getting one of those. A quick google didnt turn up anything but Ill keep looking. Also, I do have to have both eyes with prescription sunglasses. Yay family history of macular degeneration. KB

20100805 23:22:34 nbsp What is some good electronica?

Have you tried the voges bacon chocolate? Users/StevenDaubert
  Yep I sure have, its fantastic. For once I prefer the milk chocolate (dark milk) over dark. Its beautifully salty and sweet and rich. I love all the Vosges chocolate, especially the Naga bar. As far as music, I love Shiny Toy Guns, Blaqk Audio, and yes... Lady Gaga. Stuff like that. Almost electropop.

20110113 16:12:43 nbsp I appreciate your courage concerning your Grace Valley comments.  Ive never been associated with them, but I do have some experience with meanspirited christian groups. Users/JimStewart

20110724 09:38:13 nbsp Thank you for your generous comment at Friendly Cab.  It reminded me of those brave ones who call from a blocked number to cuss rediculously.  I think I met you at the Wiki picnic? Users/BruceHansen
