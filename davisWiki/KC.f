20091230 09:17:42 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. After looking at your edit history, in particular your edits to Creative Hair, Im going to suggest that you read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms.

20100202 18:35:23 nbsp Deleting content doesnt work on the wiki. You can add new content and note that historic information is no longer current, but dont go around deleting other editors contributions. Users/JasonAller

20100202 20:19:58 nbsp Please understand that the wiki is not a business listing site  it is a resource for the Davis community, cowritten by members of the community.  As such, history is preserved  even the history of someone who used to work some place.  So, please stop making deletions from the Creative Hair page.  They will just be reverted, as is happening now.  All you are doing is frustrating yourself and other wiki editors. Users/CovertProfessor

20100202 20:46:46 nbsp You dont want the photo. Many other editors want to save it because it represents a part of the history of Davis. Why should your desire to remove it prevail over their desire to retain it? Users/JasonAller

20100202 20:53:22 nbsp In response to your edit comment: Please Delete the group photo! Call me at 3938321. Doing so would allow you to talk to only one other editor and would cut the rest of the editors out of the collaborative editing process. Users/JasonAller
