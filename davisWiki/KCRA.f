A local Media television station, and an affiliate of the NBC network.  The relationship with http://www.nbcuni.com NBC Universal grants KCRA the rights to broadcast Late Night with Conan OBrien, to use NBCs WeatherPlus system for weather reporting, and to sell knickknacks at a store called The KCRA Experience.  Syndicated programming includes The Oprah Winfrey Show and reruns of stuff.

KCRA airs the news live from their glass windowed studio at Arden Fair Mall everyday at noon. You can be on live TV when you to go to Arden Fair. Just stand behind the anchors at the windows.

KCRA was started at the California State Fair by a local Sacramento family in the 1950s.

KCRA has more bureaus throughout California than any other station in the state.  KCRA takes pride in their traffic and breaking news chopper, nicknamed LiveCopter 3.  In 1997, pilot of LiveCopter 3 Michael Kidd rescued a dog named Rodeo from a rooftop during a flood.  This earned Kidd, LiveCopter 3 and KCRA fame on Sacramentos PBS station.  It also earned Kidd a guest appearance on Oprah as well as a story the following year in Readers Digest.

KCRA 3 Reports is the highestrated local news broadcast in the Central Valley as of this writing.  The most wellknown anchors of this newscast are Dave Walker and Lois Hart, who were also CNNs very first anchors.

The station is owned by http://www.hearstargyle.com/ HearstArgyle Television, as is KQCA WB 58.  History buffs will certainly recognize the name; the company is spun off the same http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst Hearst who owned the newspaper empire and built the wiki:WikiPedia:Hearst Castle castle on the California coast.  Business types will recognize the Hearst television presence in Sacramento as a duopoly.

In July 2006, KCRA announced it would bring to its viewing audience a brandnew breaking news LiveCopter.  A sneakpeek video of the new LiveCopter has appeared on KCRAs website.

  So if KCRA is the most powerful and biggest TV station around, how come their broadcast signal is so much weaker than the other stations around? It is so hard to get a good signal via my rabbit ear antenna. Yet all the other local stations are as clear as cable...  Users/BrianSolecki

   Biggest, yes.  Most powerful, not so much.  A great many Davis residents have the same complaint; I sold antennas to many of them.  The people I talk to are divided as to the cause; some say weak transmission power, others say that KCRA has their transmitter pointed the wrong way.  Others have said both, but I think KCRA didnt want to compete with thenNBC affiliate KRON out of San Francisco in places where their signals would overlap.  In any case, KCRA is aware of reception issues in Davis, but I havent seen any change in a long time.  Best remedy  buy an outdoor antenna, like the big spiny ones everyone had on their rooftops in the 1950s.  Theyre still the best, even for HDTV.  Users/JeffLeCates jlc
