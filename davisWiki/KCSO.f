One of the area Media television stations, KCSO licensed to Sacramento and is affiliated with the Telemundo network.  Its programming includes networkproduced news, imported and original telenovelas, talk shows, and WWE Raw dubbed into Spanish.  Additionally, Telemundo 33 airs a relatively large quantity of Spanishdubbed movies every Sunday.  No locallyproduced programming airs on KCSO, despite its affiliation with NBCowned Telemundo.  (NBC encourages all their affiliates to have a local news division.)

The LP in the stations callsign means low power, and they mean it.  Reception in Davis can be difficult with an overtheair antenna.  Its lack of a digital feed exacerbates reception woes.
