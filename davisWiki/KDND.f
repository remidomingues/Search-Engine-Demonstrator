The End is a Media radio station based out of Sacramento. It is a Top 40 station geared toward the 14 to 24 year old market.

The station used to produce one of the toprated morning drive programs, entitled The Morning Rave.  A 28 year old mother died from http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_017021615.html water intoxication following a dangerous radio station contest entitled Hold Your Wee For A Wii. This prompted the station to fire 10 employees, including all of the morning show DJs, and indefinitely cancel the morning program.  The story made http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6261509.stm international headlines.  Over a year and a half later, lawsuits are still http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/2095821.html being filed.

Despite their call sign, they do not discuss Roleplaying games DnD on the radio, though they probably should.
