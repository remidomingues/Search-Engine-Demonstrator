This page is a whos who for KDVS DJs. Please dont just make it a list. You can always find the detailed schedule for the current academic quarter http://kdvs.org/schedule/grid/ here.  Something out of date on the list?  Go ahead and fix it!

Some DJs seem to disappear from the airwaves during the summer  thats partially because the freshmen DJs are booted from the dorms with the rest of their first year kind, and thus endure a temporary exile in their home towns.
