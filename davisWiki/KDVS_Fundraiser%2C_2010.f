Its that time of year for the KDVS Fundraiser Annual KDVS Fundraiser!

This year our theme is LET FREEFORM RING:

Every day, every week, every hour we provide you the best alternative programming on this coast for YOU the listener. We attempt to inform you with the best of public affairs and keep corporate infectious media at bay.

From APRIL 1925TH the tables are turned. While we do what we can to provide any resource we have, we need YOUR help to stay sustained.

2/3rds of our budget come from listener donations, and all of those donations go to our KDVS programming. In exchange we offer all the resources we have: our limitless library, our awesome programming, our mobile dj unit, our shows, our festivals, our dance parties, and not to mention the SICKK premiums we have to offer.

So heres what you do: listen all week, listen to what we have to offer (and all the hilarious programming) and decide whether we are a community resource worth supporting for you.
