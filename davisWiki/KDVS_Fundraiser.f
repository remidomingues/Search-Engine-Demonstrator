Image(funsigns.jpg, KDVS DJs at Picnic Day 2005, 300, right, thumbnail)Every year KDVS 90.3FM has a fundraiser from which they receive over two thirds of their operating ASUCD budget.  In exchange for your donation you get a premium, a thankyou gift consisting of Music Scene music, books, tshirts, etc. that usually totals more than the amount of your pledge.  We get this stuff from record labels, local businesses, etc. and you get a ton of it for supporting noncorporate community radio.

Just to make a better case of why we need this money...KDVS does not receive any taxpayer money.  A lot of people think that because we are a public radio station, we do; but we dont.  Much of the budget comes from ASUCD registration fees.  On a per quarter basis, not quite a dollar per student goes to KDVS for our expenses.  The next biggest part of our budget comes from listener contributions, and we only ask for donations for one week a year.  This is it.  A little bit more money comes from the support of local business sponsorship.  We run a 9200 watt station with a big web presence on just under $100,000.  The Stanford station is 1/20th the power and runs on 3.5 times that.  So its very important to have the support, and theres so much we do to deserve it.  Please keep donating and help us out...thanks! Users/RickEle

2012 FUNDRAISER


NOW

KDVS 90.3 FM in Davis is gearing up for its annual fundraiser. This years Fundraiser will occur Monday, April 23rd through Sunday, April 30th. As you may or may not know, KDVS is the UCDavis student/community radio station. It is truly one of the last bastions of freeform radio in the country.

What is freeform, you may ask. Simply put: Music DJs, public affairs hosts, and news reporters have complete control over what they broadcast. KDVS DJs are not required to adhere to a song rotation or broadcast information that has been prescribed to us by an overseeing entity.

On average, about 1/2 to 2/3 of the KDVS annual operating budget comes from contributions made by our listeners, families, and friends during our fundraiser drive. You can help KDVS reach its 2012 goal of $60,000 by pledging your support and $$s.

 History of the Fundraiser 
The KDVS fundraiser is a yearly tradition that began in 1993 as the result of ASUCD budget cuts.  The fundraiser is an integral part of KDVS current operations, with listener donations amounting for 65% of the their yearly budget.  The size and amount of funds pulled in during the fundraiser have increased over the years.  In 1997, KDVS raised $12,000.  Their 2004 fundraiser goal was $55,000, and they pulled in $50,000 (with the addition of an unofficial second week).  In 2005 the fundraising goal was $60,000 and they fundraised $60,056 during the week and on June 6^th^ they had noted $62,590 in funds on their website. In 2006, the goal was raised again to $65,000, which was met about 1 hour before the deadline. The total for the week was $66,177. The 2007 goal of $70,000 was reached at approximately 10:30PM on the last day of the fundraiser.
