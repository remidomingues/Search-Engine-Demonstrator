KDVS is always trying to make local music more accessible to the community, and starting a record label seemed like a good way to do it. The labels establishment was funded by ASUCD Senate, thanks to a bill they passed in spring 2006. As far as KDVS can tell, KDVSR is the only universityfunded, campus radiorun record label in the country.

KDVS Recordings has several albums available on its http://recordings.kdvs.org/ website, including releases from Alak, Boss the Big Bit, San Francisco Water Cooler, Pregnant, Art Lessing, Whos Your Favorite Son, God?, and Dead Western. Upcoming albums include a compilation of local hiphop artists and another compilation of local folk acts.
