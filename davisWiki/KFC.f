The Davis KFC is located in South Davis off of the I80 exit Richards Blvd  South Davis.  There is plenty of parking, indoor seating and a drivethru.  Near the entrance on a bench is wiki:WikiPedia:Colonel_Sanders the Colonel.

KFC is a fast food chain that specializes in fried chicken but also serves other items. KFC introduced a new healthier menu item called Kentucky Grilled Chicken in 2009. Way back in 1991, they started selling what they called KFC skinless (since almost all the fat and calories are in the skin), but it didnt last long. There are chicken twists (like a burrito), chicken salads, chicken sandwiches, chicken wings (honey BBQ, hot, boneless or bones) and popcorn chicken. Some side items include mashed potatoes with gravy, cole slaw, corn on the cob, biscuits, macaroni salad, and potato wedges. For dessert try a pie, pilaf or cheesecake.

Many of their products http://www.kfc.com/nutrition/pdf/kfc_allergens_sept09.pdf contain MSG, if thats an issue/concern for you.

Check your mail box for coupons. Theyll also have coupons at the counter.  They do not check the coupons or keep them so you can reuse them.  Use your Super Saver Card to get a free 20 oz. soft drink with purchase of $3 or more OR 8 piece meal for $13.99.

Just for note, almost everyone knows that KFC originally stood for Kentucky Fried Chicken. While many rumors about this name change abound, one even saying that it was because of the use of genetically altered chickens, the truth is very simple and quite silly to boot. The name was changed to avoid paying royalties to the state of Kentucky which placed a Trademark on its name in 1990 and had been in legal disputes with many individuals as well as corporations over the name. In 1991, KFC began to appear with most of the locations changing the name while a few holdouts of historic Importance remained. After an out of court agreement was breached by the state in 2006 the company decided to think of altering the name of the remaining chains which still had the older name associated with them and finally did, with the final location being changed in 2008. In late 2006, the company reached another agreement with state and was given the right to change the name back again to a select few locations. At that time the new KFC chain declined. In late 2008 they began to change their minds and rumor has it that you will once again see some Kentucky Fried Chickens building some new coops, so to speak.

Another myth about the name change is that the word Fried was now taboo and they were losing customers who were looking for something healthier.

There also used to be a combo KFC/A&W in Dixon.

This isnt the first location for KFC in town. It used to be located where The Lofts are now.

Daily deals this is wrong. 03/12/2013


Drinks are NOT included in either special. If you plan on going there at night, please note that they tend to run out of certain items early, like their chicken pot pies.

Controversy

Several suppliers of KFC have been investigated for animal abuse, often prompted by videos taken in secret at the processing plants.  While this is not KFC doing the abuse, some of their http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/investigations.asp suppliers of the year were accused of having the problem.  As Dan Rather said about the video: theres no mistaking what the video depicts: cruelty to animals, chickens horribly mistreated before theyre slaughtered for a fastfood chain.  These allegations have led some to call for a boycott.

The best things on the menu are the popcorn Chickens chicken and the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, I believe it is called.

It might be just me, but I find their wraps delicious.  users/AndreyGoder

Back in the day, they used to offer free popcorn chicken as a promotion. Keep your eyes open for this, as my buddies and i used to exploit it left and right.  users/DerekTam

Pretty good for a KFC. Its relatively clean and well run and the food is adequate. I prefer extra crispy to original recipe.

Check the mail for coupons they send, it will save you money. Furthermore, they dont usually collect the coupons when you use them, so you can reuse them as long as they havent expired. The next closest fast food fried chicken is the Popeyes in Dixon.   users/AndrewMatey

20050513 15:50:00 nbsp Last time I was there, my chicken strips were RAW on the inside. So break them open before you eat them. users/AshleyOrsaba

20050712 21:45:36 nbsp KFC has jumped into the $1 sandwich market and has a Snacker that is delicious... dare I say, much better than CJs spicy chicken sammy. users/KenNeville

20050720 03:38:25 nbsp Fried Chicken in Davis. Score. users/AndreHarris

20060514 11:45:47 nbsp Theyve run out of chicken all of the two times that Ive gone there after 9:30 pm! This boggles the hell out of me! users/CathleenLu

20061102 22:00:51 nbsp I liked my visit here. The staff were very friendly. After I ordered, the cashier gave me a free drink because I had been waiting in line for a while. users/MattLow

20061218 07:33:39 nbsp The bowl is quite good. users/NickSchmalenberger

20070303 03:49:35 nbsp Does anyone know if theyve switched to non transfat oil locally? users/GrumpyoldGeek

20070315 12:58:04 nbsp on tuesdays..the chicken and corn combo for $2.99 is a steal..if you dont like the corn, they let u substitute it  for other sides but only sometimes..depends on the cashier users/DonaldJaye

20070511 19:20:15 nbsp Spectacular. And now its transfat free. The staff has gotten exceptionally friendly the last few times Ive gone too. Users/William.Peacock
   Not everything on the menu is trans fat free. Other foods, such as the biscuits, still contain trans fats. users/AnnaJones
     As an update long after the above conversation, as of Jan 1 2010, all restaurants in California are now transfat free. jw

20070531 08:23:05 nbsp HIGH SODIUM CONTENT in all of their foods except maybe the cole slaw/salad.  I would love to eat here, but their chicken taste like a salt lick!   Users/RobRobRob

20070719 18:50:42 nbsp yuk!!!!!!!!!! Users/dickjones

20070804 03:42:14 nbsp If really in the mood it is ok but i would rather travel to get good chicken like churches or popeyes  Users/Brians

20070925 21:03:08 nbsp Its bad for you.  You shouldnt eat the skin but you know... when you want fried chicken, where else are you going to get your fix?  KFC. Users/atwong

20071116 01:31:26 nbsp theyll rob you.  beware, if you buy 6 or more pieces of chicken make sure that you check that you got the right number of chicken before you drive home.  I paid for an 8piece chicken dinner meal and when I got home I only got 6 pieces of chicken.  Im angry, where can I make a complaint?    Users/kikao

20080528 22:31:33 nbsp Worst KFC in America.  It seems like something goes wrong every single time Im here.  The service is so sloweven when theyre not busy.  And theyre always out of everything.  After making you wait forever and not having anything, they dont even offer you anything to make up for it.  At least, I have never been offered anything.   Its actually kind of good this place is so horrible.  Keeps me from going back.  And, you too.  This S isnt health food. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080710 16:43:34 nbsp Gag me with a spoon... Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  I think you mean spork.

20080729 01:06:56 nbsp The staff is out of control at least they were awhile back... sometimes I swear they were stoned thats probably why service is slow. Dude, put the weed down youre at work, I dont know really for sure but they all acted like they were so whatever. I never had them running out of things unless I went at closing time then the shit was all gone and what was left I wouldnt force it upon my worst enemy. And yea its fast food and its unhealthy just like all fast food, of course it doesnt help that they still use MSG thats why everything is so salty. The new staff I think is alright, but I really dont go there anymore so it dont matter. Users/csmith

20090504 16:42:54 nbsp The service wasnt as good as other places that Ive been to, but theyre not big problems so its a decent place overall. Users/thtly

20090506 11:18:10 nbsp I happen to think that this KFC does a great job at honoring promotions, coupons, and waiting on customers. The manager is very friendly and helpful and if I have waited for my food or an order was screwed up they always compensated me somehow whether it was extra biscuits, a free drink or an extra side . My favorite items include the crispy twister wrap found on the value menu, and the chicken potato bowls. The Cajun chicken was also very good when they had it. The Davis branch is currently participating in the Oprah Grilled Chicken promotion and they honored every coupon. My friend and I went thru the drive thru and had no problems. The grilled chicken is very tasty and I think will become very popular. As for someones comment about running out of chicken late at night, they dont run out, but rather will cook to order which I think is great. That way the customer knows the chicken is hot and fresh and has not been sitting around for several hours during busy dinnertime. The super saver card is a great way to save here, in the past they had buy one 2 piece meal get one free: thats a good deal 4 pieces of chicken, 4 sides, and 2 biscuits for around $5.39. Good job KFC,keep up the awesome work.  Users/ElizabethBarthel
    Not sure about now, but several years ago, they did run out of chicken and other items in the last hour of the day on a regular basis.  Perhaps they have changed that.  The most recent complaint of the few that mention running out of items was added nearly a year ago.  And I agree  the grilled chicken is quite nice. jw

20090507 10:28:41 nbsp KFC fried chicken is quite possibly the most vile thing ever.  That being said I love getting a box of snack sized wings and/or drumsticks w/ BBQ sauce to take to the beach.  Its kind of a tradition. Users/MasonMurray

20090515 20:21:07 nbsp This one has abnormally gross chicken. Users/julpham

20090725 00:22:03 nbsp The last time I was in there, they said they werent serving Extra Crispy any more???  Can anyone confirm this? I was dumbfounded.  It was as if McDonalds told me they no longer serve Big Macs.... Users/MichaelMacIntosh
  Did they just mean that day?  They may just have been out. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  My bad...I finally got around to checking again. The STRIPS only come in Original now, not Extra Crispy, but they do still have Extra Crispy breasts, thighs, drumsticks, etc.  Whew!  Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20100131 19:32:57 nbsp Good food, horrible customer service. The person name Jessica took our order, she greeted us with an exasperated look on her face and mumbled everything. When asked to repeat, she responded in a rude manner. I would think KFC would put a more welltrained employee to greet their customers. Beside that upsetting encounter, the food was nothing short of arteryclogging satisfaction : Users/BeanMarine

20100418 10:40:04 nbsp Double Down is garbage! Users/JamesGallerani

20100418 23:03:55 nbsp When I got the Double Down here, it was tasty. I knew it was only about 500 Calories, but I was still surprised how small it was. Its not really worth $5, but it definitely wasnt bad either. I would probably get it again, but not every time I go to KFC. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100604 22:06:49 nbsp The kind lady just gave me a free drink because we had to wait for an order. Imagine that!  Users/Greenlover48

20100822 21:50:57 nbsp So I went here tonight and was waiting for my order when I saw a woman who had already gotten her order go up to the counter with an open container of one of their meals and said she got the wrong chicken piece. The person behind the counter used a pair of tongs to grab the wrong piece and I was expecting him to toss it out but instead he put it back under the heat lamps. Sort of unsanitary because the woman could have touched the piece of chicken before figuring out that it was the wrong piece, but that might be me just being neurotic. Anyway, I still ate my food after I got it. Users/hankim

20110403 23:23:52 nbsp I wasnt happy when they stopped serving baked beans. Seems that the food quality depends on time of day. The last couple of times I went in the afternoon, and the chicken was either overcooked or had been sitting out too long.
 Users/nowhereman

20110902 17:40:18 nbsp Except for Jessica (who was exceptionally rude), customer service has been great. Food tastes like KFC. :) Users/AlexMendoza
