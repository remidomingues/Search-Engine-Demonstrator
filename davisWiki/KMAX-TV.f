A local Media television station, and an affiliate of http://www.cwtv.com/ The CW Television Network.  During the MLB (baseball) regular season, this station is the home to many SF Giants and Oakland As games.  Additionally, CW 31 produces the morning news program Good Day Sacramento.  Their coverage of UCD and city events is pretty good.

KMAXTV began as an Independent station.  It became KRBK in the late 1980s after abandoning its change from an Independent station to a Spanishlanguage station.  With a purchase by Koplar Broadcasting, it became an Independent station once again, competing directly with KTXL.

In 1994, KRBK was purchased by Pappas Broadcasting and changed its call letters to KPWB.  In 1995, it was affiliated with the Warner Brotheres television network.  In the late 1990s, KPWB stationswapped with KQCA 58 and became KMAXTV, Sacramentos UPN affiliate.  When UPN closed up shop, KMAXTV became a charter CW affiliate.

KMAXTV prides itself on hosting the number one morning news program in the Sacramento metro area, Good Day Sacramento.  GDS runs from 6AM to 10AM on weekdays, competing (and winning) against tapedelayed programs on KCRA, KXTV and KOVR.  KMAXTV has made personalities out of its anchors and reportersmost notably, entertainment reporter and former 102.5 FM DJ Mark S. Allen.  Allen once spent an entire month on a billboard in a stunt for GDS, in which he fell twice and broke both his arms.  Anchor Marianne McClary and traffic reporter Tina Macuah are the only two personalities on GDS who were on the very first broadcast.  In mid2005, GDS celebrated ten years of being on the air and eagerly looked to the future when  its broadcasts would take place in the studios of KOVRTV following a merger with KOVR and CBS Television.

Over Memorial Day weekend in 2006, the duopoly with KOVR was further solidified when KMAXTV moved its broadcast and production assets to KOVRs building.  Instead of building a new set, however, the Good Day Sacramento set pieces were dismantled and reassembled in the KOVR Drive studio.  The only visual cues that theyre in a new building is a redesigned Mega Map and newsroom.  Previous Mega Map incarnations were canvas mats; the new one is painted on the floor.  The newsroom has more of a KOVR feel, with a plasmascreen in the background bearing the Good Day Sacramento logo.

In 2004, KMAXTV ended Good Evening Sacramento, the predecessor to UPN 31 Action News.  This was UPN 31s answer to a primetime newscast.  Today, KMAXTV is the only channel affiliated with a network in the Sacramento metro area that does not have a primetime newscast.

The station was rebranded CW 31 on August 7, 2006.  No word yet if there will be more http://www.cbs13.com/video/?id10283@kovr.dayport.com meterologists break dancing to celebrate.

The station is owned by http://www.cbstvdmg.com/ CBS Television Stations, and is part of a duopoly with KOVR.  In the event that CBS programming cant be seen on KOVR, or if KOVR must preempt programming to air breaking news, the programming is shown on KMAXTV.

Davis is a candidate for a segment entitled Allentown in which Mark S. Allen interacts with the locals and checks out attractions.  Viewers can vote for Davis among two other cities (Ripon, Sheridan) by visiting http://cbs13.com/gooddaysacramento http://cbs13.com/gooddaysacramento before January 22nd.
