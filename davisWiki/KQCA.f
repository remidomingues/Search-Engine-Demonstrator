A local Media television station, and an affiliate of Foxs http://www.mynetworktv.com MyNetworkTV network.  (Never could have guessed that from the web site address, huh?)  Formerly affiliated with The WB network, the affiliation swapped on September 5, 2006.  Longtime Sacramento residents will remember this station by many names, including Q58 and the very original KQCA 58.

Programming on My 58 is as varied as it is 1834 demographictargeted.  You can tune to this station on weeknights for episodes of The Simpsons and Friends (when My Network programming isnt being shown).  Additionally, the station simulcasts the popular Armstrong and Getty morning radio talk show from 7:00 until 10:00, which can be heard on KSTE.  The radio broadcast is on a 5second delay; the television broadcast has no delay.

This station is owned by http://www.hearstargyle.com/ HearstArgyle Television right alongside KCRA.  These two stations even share a building, even though their addresses differ.  As a result, the news reports on KQCA will feature similiar stories and reporters of that of KCRA.

About My Network TV

On January 23rd, 2006, CBS announced the creation of a new network:  CW Television Network, or The CW.  This network is a combination of WB and UPN.  In September, KMAXTV will drop affiliation with UPN and become CW, while KQCA dropped WB affiliation and was expected to become independent.

The Sacramento Bee http://www.sacticket.com/tv_radio/story/14272464p15082789c.html broke the story on June 28 that KQCA will affiliate with News Corporations http://www.mynetworktv.com MyNetworkTV network in September 2006.  Its new onair name is My 58.  The new network will operate as a sibling to Fox, and borrows its name from MySpace.  Thus, the rumors of KQCA independence are false.
