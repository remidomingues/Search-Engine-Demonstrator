Talk City. Progressive talk radio.  Former http://www.airamerica.com/ Air America Radio affiliate as of Oct 1, 2005, however its new programming is still progressive. Air America chose to move to KCTC (1340 AM) apparently due to its stronger signal and will begin Broadcasting there on November 1, 2005.  This can be a harder station to voice your opinion on because most shows are national, but between 3PM and 6PM you can easily get on the Christine Craft show.
