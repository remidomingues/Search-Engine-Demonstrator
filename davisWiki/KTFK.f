KTFK is the Telefutura ownedandoperated station in Sacramento, and is part of a duopoly with KUVS.  Its parent company, http://www.univision.net/corp/intro.jsp Univision Communications, purchased the station in 2004 (http://www.univision.net/corp/en/pr/Sacramento_150120043.html source).  Prior to 2004, the station was called KFTL, and ran mostly Christian programming.

Telefutura is to Univision what UPN is to CBS; an attempt to grab a younger, hipper demographic.  To this end, the network broadcast includes somewhat more raunchy dramas than the Univision network.  Additionally, the station broadcasts movies, cartoons, and a good amount of sports.  The station airs no locallyproduced programming.

Oh, and its all in Spanish.
