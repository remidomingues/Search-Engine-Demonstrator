A local Sacramento Media television station, and an affiliate of Rupert Murdochs FOX network.

In 1972, KTXL became the first station to air a daily 10PM primetime newscast.  Now, KTXL, KQCA and KOVR air a 10PM newscast.

In 1986, KTXL made the decision (way in advance of its Bay Area counterpart KTVU 2) to leave the independent station scene and join the FOX television network, where it continues its operations as a FOX affiliate serving Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto metro areas.

In the summer of 2005, KTXL broke away from its reputation of being the only station in the Sacramento metro area not to have a morning news program.  Its currently in competition with KMAX leading program Good Day Sacramento.  The station airs a fourandahalf hour news program at 4:30AM weekdays, with an hourlong strictlynews 9AM newscast following (by comparison KMAX airs GDS from 4:30AM to 10AM weekdays and 6AM to 10AM on the weekends).

The stations current owner is http://www.tribune.com Tribune Broadcasting, which owns other FOX and CW stations nationwide.  When KTXL came under the ownership of Tribune Broadcasting in 1995, the station trashed much of its archived locallyproduced programming, including some of its 16mm films.  Collectors and some station staff rescued many of these films from the dumpster.

In 2006, KTXL announced plans to air a television music service through its DT channel, 40.2.  Known as http://www.thetubetv.com/ The Tube, its programming is made entirely of music videos.  The channel was launched on Comcasts digital platform. In October 2007, The Tube went off the air.  In 2008, KTXL affiliated itself with a SpanishEnglish bilingual digital network LATV, though that affiliation ended less than a year later.
