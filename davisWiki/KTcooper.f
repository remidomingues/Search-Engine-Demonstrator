20090502 12:21:59 nbsp A belated Welcome to the Wiki, and thanks for all youve done to keep the SPCA Thrift Store page current. How about branching out and editing a few other pages? Users/JasonAller

20100822 14:01:25 nbsp Hi KT (Katie?).  You realize it looks pretty shady when you http://daviswiki.org/SPCA_Thrift_Store?actiondiff&version2987&version1986 leave http://daviswiki.org/SPCA_Thrift_Store?actiondiff&version21036&version11035 comments for a store where you clearly work/volunteer.  Its great that you keep the page so up to date, but lets try to keep it all honest, eh?  In fact, it looks like youve got a total of 701 edits to the SPCA Thrift Store page, out of 702 total edits.  Thats pretty impressive!  As Jason suggested a while back, why not branch out and contribute to some other pages?  The thing that makes the wiki a spectacular resource is the contribution of so many editors. Users/TomGarberson

20100906 11:26:26 nbsp KT CooperI think its very inappropriate that you purposely schill for your store that you obviously work at. Due to that Im marking your duplicitous comments from the SPCA Thrift Store. Users/PeterBoulay

20101113 14:22:46 nbsp Ha!  Great phrase... I need to exclaim sweet cracker sandwich! one of these days. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101113 15:09:54 nbsp The impression I get from todays post is that the store is closing. Is that what you meant to say? SPCA Thrift is going out of business?  Users/DonShor
