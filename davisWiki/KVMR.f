Nevada City Community Radio; one of the locallyreceivable radio stations.

KVMRFM is a volunteerbased, listenersupported radio station fostering positive social change by entertaining, informing, and educating our community through the presentation of diverse music, cultural, news, and public affairs programming.  Their Mission Statement.

KVMR is a great independant station that can be heard, but reception can be dicey in Davis, so its good to know you also have the option of listening http://kvmr.org/webcast.html online.

The stations call letters stem from the abbreviation of where the station was originally located, at the American Victorian Museum on Spring Street in downtown Nevada City. K refers to any station west of the Mississippi River and the VMR stands for Victorian Museum Radio. My http://www.kvmr.org/personalities/d_scanlan.html poppa has been a DJ on the station since I was a little kid, and has gone under the names of Dan Ratherthan and Rodd Gnawkin, among others, and is currently known as http://coolhanduke.com/ Cool Hand Uke.

The radio station moved a few years ago, to an office complex, also on Spring Street, and has expanded to fill the entire first story and most of the second.  I interned there in 1997/1998, during my senior year of high school. Some of my favorite shows include Who Cares? Friday at noon, hosted by the wonderful http://kvmr.org/personalities/j_buffington.html Joan Buffington; Organic Matters, every second Friday 1 PM hosted by mi amigo Amigo Bob; The Wednesday morning show, 7am10, with http://kvmr.org/personalities/s_baker.html Steve Baker; and my favorite, http://www.kvmr.org/about/broadcasterprofile.html End of the Trail Saloon, every other Sunday night 10PM12AM.  http://www.coolhanduke.com My dad recently stopped engineering for and performing on this show, and I dont know if his buddies are continuing without him, but it really was a wonderful two hours.
