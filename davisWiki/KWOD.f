KWOD, aka 106.5 The Buzz is an all90s music radio stations FM radio station.  Their current format started May 22nd, 2009, and the changeover was referenced in the http://www.reallifecomics.com/archive/090601.html June 1st comic of Real Life.

Past Formats

From June 6th, 2005 to to May 22, 2009 at 9am, they were KWOD Footnote(pronounced Quad) Version 2.0. In their glory days of independent ownership, their motto was 51 minutes of nonstop KWOD because of having commercials only once an hour.

Prior to June 6th, 2005, they were Alternative Rock. For an interesting read on the change, check out http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/20050616/news.asp this Sacramento News & Review article. On, KWOD switched formats to all90s and became 106.5 The Buzz.

When KWOD 106 went on the air in the 1970s, the name came from the fact that they were broadcasting quadraphonically, a shortlived idea that probably died because most people werent willing to buy 4 speakers. At that time they were moreorless album rock. Their main competition was KZAP. Locally there was a funky little station called KYLO (KYLO Gold!) that played a very eclectic mix. If you remember any of this, you are at least 40 years old.



Reviews of KWOD Version 2.0
  In my opinion the v2.0 this is crap. KWOD used to be pretty decent but then they changed and now it sounds a lot like Alice 97.3 and The End 107.9! Damn you, KWOD!  Users/MichelleAccurso Michelle

  It is more between KZZO The Zone and KHWD Howard than the end due to its complete lack of hip hop/R&B pop music.  I kinda like it new change, but then again, the format change was directed right at my demographic the late 20/early 30s people that listened to KWOD 10+ years ago and had tuned out in recent years. Well, that and its playlist was too similar to KRXQ 98 Rock, which was also owned by entercom, so it was easier to find a different demo to exploit than have 2 of their own stations compete against each other.

  I dont really believe that KWOD is catering to the people who used to listen and dont anymore; I used to listen and stopped about five years ago, but I have no desire to listen to the new crappy format.  I do, however, hate the new format less than the one it just replaced!  Users/SummerSong ss

  Back in the early to mid 90s KWOD was all about Depeche Mode and the Cure. That type of stuff. And their format shifted to be more like 98 Rock, playing Metallica and Papa Roach. But since they are now owned by the same people as 98 Rock, they want to be different  or at least different in the terms of radio stations owned by that company that broadcast in the Sacramento valley.

20080903 15:19:35 nbsp KWOD used to play better music, but I dont care.  I like KWOD because they air The Adam Carolla Show from 5am to 10am Monday  Friday.  Best thing since Howard Stern.  I just hope that they dont drop Adam Carolla to make room for some dreadful morning radio DJs.   Users/CurlyGirl26

Reviews of 106.5 The Buzz

20090522 23:06:07 nbsp SN&R’s contact with the new KWOD v2.0’s deejays was cut short by program director Jim Robinson, who himself cited a “busy workload” as his own reason for declining repeated interview requests. SN&R later was copied on an email Robinson sent out to staff originally contacted for interviews, in which the program director offered a concise edict: “Let’s pass on this guy,” Robinson wrote. “I’ve emailed him that we’re too busy for an interview. This paper would not be KWOD v2.0friendly. Thanks.”

Radio without rules, indeed.

{{{^^^}}} I remember when they switched formats, it was super shady. Users/StevenDaubert

20090524 00:01:49 nbsp Just when I thought it couldnt get worse.  First, CBS radio pulls the plug on Adam Carolla.  And now, they switched to generic 90s music.  I listened in for a few minutesjust to remind myself why I abandoned terrestrial radio in the first place.   What an abortion.   Users/CurlyGirl26
