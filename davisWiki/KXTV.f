KXTV shares a transmission tower with KOVR, the areas CBS affiliate.  The wiki:wikipedia:KXTV/KOVR Tower KXTVKOVR Transmission Tower is the tallest structure built in California, and the fourth largest in the world.  Another transmission tower for KXTV, located elsewhere, also shares transmission space with KOVR and KCRA 3.

The tower where KXTV transmits its signal from is shared with rival television station KOVR.  The tower is considered the tallest television tower in the world.  KXTV receives its call letters with X being the Roman Numeral for ten.

When KXTV launched in 1955, it was originally KBET.  Four years later, it changed its call letters.  In 2000, it discontinued the name KXTV 10 and became News10.

After KMAXTV lost the contract to air Sacramento Kings games (due to a dispute with owners over advertisements), KXTV picked up the games.  They continue on KXTV today.

In 2006, KCRA meteorologist Patty Souza left the Sacramento NBC affiliate for KXTV.  News10 capitalized on her arrival through television promos and through KXTVs website.  Souza is currently News10s Chief Meteorologist.

The station is owned by http://www.gannett.com Gannett, the same corporation that owns the USA Today newspaper.
