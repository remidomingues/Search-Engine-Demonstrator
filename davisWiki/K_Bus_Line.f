The Unitrans K Bus Line, formerly the DMU line leaves from the Memorial Union MU Terminal. It serves West Davis along Russell Russell, up Lake Blvd., and down Arlington Blvd. to make a loop. Some Freshmen ride this line to Cuarto. They usually take the C Bus Line C line to get into campus, because the closest stop on the K line inbound is already on the edge of campus.

The K line stops at Arthur Street when leaving Campus campus but does not stop at Arthur when going towards campus.  The nearest eastbound stop is on  P/Q Bus Line the Q.

Check out the schedule and route map at the http://www.unitrans.ucdavis.edu/k Unitrans website for more information.

As of August 2013, the K bus line no longer serves the Adams Loop during night service.
