Kabang is a dog from the Philippines who received international recognition for saving the lives of two little girls in 2011. She jumped in front of a speeding motorcycle that was about to hit the children. As a result of the collision, she lost her upper jaw and snout. The website http://www.careforkabang.com/ began to raise funds to help Kabang get surgery. So far, the site has received more than $20,000. This was used to transport Kabang to the United States and begin care for her in October 2012. She is now receiving treatment from UC Davis veterinarians.
