 Candidate Statement 




Hello Fellow Aggies,

My name is Kabir Kapur and I am a secondyear Political Science and
Philosophy doublemajor from the Bay Area. I am running for ASUCD
Senate because I love UC Davis and I love ASUCD, and I want to make
sure that our student government does as much as possible to
positively impact the life of every student on our campus.

ASUCD Experience:
Intern for Senator Ozzy Arce
Intern for Senator André Lee
Internal Affairs Commissioner
Lobby Corps Communications Assistant
Chief of Staff for Senator Patrick Sheehan

INCREASE ASUCD’S ACADEMIC INVOLVEMENT
ASUCD has the ability to contribute more to the academic lives of
students than it currently does. One problem I have seen on campus is
students not having enough information about a class before
registering for it. A way that I propose to solve this would be to work with the
Academic Senate to require that professors make the syllabus for their
class available online before class registration. This would ensure that students have
a concrete idea of the topics and workload of the courses they are
considering registering for. By developing a working relationship
between the Academic Senate and ASUCD, solutions to academic issues
such as this and others could be found.

EMPOWER STUDENT ADVOCACY
Tuition hikes and budget cuts are no strangers to UC Davis students
and ASUCD must take a more direct role in serving students by fighting
for and defending higher education. A unified front is needed on our
campus to be able to focus on Sacramento and demand more funding from
our elected representatives in the state legislature. I propose that
we work together with faculty and the administration and reach out to
as many groups and individual students as possible to fight this fight
for higher education. ASUCD needs to be a beacon for advocacy on our
campus. I will find ways to increase student involvement in ASUCD
advocacy units such as Lobby Corps to create a stronger presence at
the Capitol. I also propose that we reach out to and connect with
alumni, especially those in government positions, with the help of the
Cal Aggie Alumni Association, to help support UC Davis lobbying
efforts.  Through building a unified coalition on our campus, we can
move forward together towards receiving more state funding.
