20071214 19:47:40 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. I suggest that because after looking at some of your edits it appears that you may have a business interest in Swirl Frozen Yogurt. Introducing yourself to the community and clearly stating your affiliations and interests goes a long way in establishing yourself as a pillar of not only the wiki community, but the community of Davis. Users/JasonAller

20071221 15:00:09 nbsp Re: my comments about leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  It did.  Look, you have a whole page of rave comments about how good your yogurt is.  So I tried it.  I hated it.  It left a bad taste in my mouth for 2 hours.  I seriously considered putting the comment on your page, but I didnt want to spoil the party.  Daviswiki is a place for public comments and not all of them will be popular or favorable.  Get over it. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20071225 11:07:27 nbsp Before we go any further, do you have any business interest in Swirl Frozen Yogart?  And for the record, I have no business interest in any yogart shop. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20071225 22:33:24 nbsp Please bless this wiki by leaving it forever. Youve got a stick up your ass over nothing and its rather annoying. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 01:33:09 nbsp FYI, I dont know GrumpyOldGeek and Ive never even seen him in person that I know of. He didnt appoint me to do anything on his behalf. Youre just being paranoid. Again, I reiterate my request that you leave the wiki forever because youre starting shit over nothing. So what if someone compared one business to another? Thats all over the wiki. Get over it! Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 01:34:32 nbsp Oh, and if youre wondering why I even saw this, check out Recent Changes. I see everything that happens on the wiki from there. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 01:38:30 nbsp You keep on asking me to remove my comments from your page. If you dont like them, click on the Edit button and remove them yourself. Youve already read them if youre removing them. Nobody is going to put them back. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 02:02:29 nbsp Just wondering, how is using my real name online any more dangerous than having it listed in the phone directory or the student directory? Your vague threats amuse me. Your assumptions as to who I am and what my intentions are amuse me as well. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 02:05:05 nbsp Oh, and in case you want to allege that I have no context for your interactions with grumpy yet again, I present http://daviswiki.org/Yogurt_Shack?actiondiff&version229&version128 this link. You can stop reiterating that stupid statement now. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 02:05:20 nbsp Youre funny.  Users/EdWins

20071226 02:35:12 nbsp Its not easedropping in a public venue. You, presumably being an employee of or the owner of Swirl Frozen Yogurt, http://daviswiki.org/Users/GrumpyoldGeek?actiondiff&version225&version124 took http://daviswiki.org/Users/GrumpyoldGeek?actiondiff&version231&version130 someone http://daviswiki.org/Users/GrumpyoldGeek?actiondiff&version232&version131 to task for something that is not against wiki norms and something http://daviswiki.org/Yogurt_Shack?actiondiff&version226&version125 you have engaged in yourself. At that point, telling a veteran user of this wiki (GrumpyoldGeek) that they should shut up is some combination of silly and pathetic. At least Grumpy didnt have the conflict of interest that is so blatantly obvious from your actions on this wiki.

Oh, and Im neither a pirate nor a stalker. I wanted to put up a silly picture on my user page and me in a pirate hat sufficed for that. I dont drink grog, plunder, loot, or otherwise engage in nautical piracy. I dont pretend to be any more badass than than the boring electrical engineering student that I am. Im not a stalker either. All the info about everything you and everyone else do on this wiki is easily accessible by going to that users user page, clicking on the info button, and going to the Users Info tab. It takes all of five seconds to find this information, not the many hours that would entail stalking. If you want to continue to believe that using the awesome tools that Sycamore (or just about any wiki engine) provides constitutes stalking, however, that is your prerogative. Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 06:01:56 nbsp If you want to be taken seriously here or have any influence you can start by using your Importance of Using Your RealName real name. Then you can provide new information, such as about the yogurt, that would provide the context you mentioned to your brouhaha with Users/GrumpyoldGeek instead of just a contrary opinion (weve all already seen what you have said here on the wiki, so if there is more context than that, please tell). The wiki is a public forum, not a place for private arguments, and arguments that occur here should help people learn more about Davis, such as with http://daviswiki.org/Sam%27s_Mediterranean/Politics?actionrecall&version168 Sams Mediterranean/Politics. Right now, I pretty much agree with William about you. The people who are paying attention here are pretty much all information addicts, so if you have credible and useful new information we will like you alot better. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20071226 10:21:09 nbsp Kafani, please drop the personal attacks.  Not everybody gets along with everybody else, but you need to remember that there are real people on the other side.  This is not a random internet forum where trashtalking scores points; we are a group of people working together.  Take a moment and look at all the people who are using their real name and show up at Wiki gatherings to meet each other in real life.  The wiki is composed of a group of neighbors and a handful of far flung exDavisites who actually care about this town.  You can debate all you want about yogurt, but stop with the personal insults.

20071226 14:10:43 nbsp I have minions? Awesome! Users/WilliamLewis

20071226 20:26:13 nbsp It looks like you got off to a rough start with the Wiki. Do you have any questions about how things work around here? Users/JasonAller

20071227 01:17:19 nbsp Well said, JabberWokky. Users/CurlyGirl26

20071227 01:45:09 nbsp Everyone is a moderator of this site.  Even you.  People are supposed to selfappoint themselves to moderator duties, thats the way this anarchy actually turns into something nice and readable for everyone.  Welcome to the wiki  its a town hall, commons, and bulletin board, and history book all rolled into one. Users/BrentLaabs

20080904 03:22:32 nbsp wow you had problems with Williamlewis too. Tsk tsk. What a douche.

I had problems with him when I first used Daviswiki.

Anyways, dont mind him. Hes noone important.

He accused me of using a sockpuppet, and in actuality it was one of my housemmates that thought he was a douche too. She shared the same internet connection as I did so we came from the same IP. But seriously, I never had a sockpuppet.

If anything, hes got a stick up his ass. hahha Users/ThUn

20101207 09:10:24 nbsp Thats a lot of anger over on Cindys.  Chill out. Users/TomGarberson

20101207 20:00:29 nbsp I think its funny how so many people on here get on my case about being OMG SO SRS when Ive left maybe a total of 3 comments on this site, with total disregard to how people perceive these comments. Because, well, they are my fvcking opinions. Im entitled to them. And then look at this army of nerds follow me around telling me I need to calm down, when its so obvious that its YOU GUYS who are getting worked up. Online communities are full of shit. :) Users/Kafani
     Having opinions is totally acceptable (when offered respectably). Acting like a kid who has to use profanity in every sentence doesnt help you look too good either, friend. Youre in collegeacting like an adult should be on your agenda. PeteB

20101207 20:18:27 nbsp You know this isnt the WoW forums, right? Users/TomGarberson

20101207 20:22:14 nbsp That last comment about WoW just completely goes against EVERYTHING you said about acting like an adult. Yes, you got your point across. Why add something insulting at the end? Need the last word that badly? And no, I dont play WoW. I talk online the same way I talk in real life. I am usually very polite. Just not when it comes to people that obviously annoy the shit out of me. Users/Kafani

20101207 20:27:27 nbsp Hmm?  I didnt say anything about being adult.  I find you entertaining. Users/TomGarberson

20101207 20:31:42 nbsp oh that was another guy, lol my bad.

damn, i would really stop with the condescending tone if i was you. this is by no way a threat, but if i see someone around town that looks like the dude in your pic, be prepared to get knocked the fuck out. and dont say you didnt have it coming. im sure after that we can be friends. Users/Kafani
     Physical threats?!? Oh now thats being an adult. By the way posting it here is a slick move....oh almost forgot, making physical threats to a practicing attorney is a poor idea. PeteB

20101207 20:37:01 nbsp i never said anything about being an adult. that was all you. i accept myself for who i am, a kid who still has stuff to learn. hence, why im in fucking college. also, i was kidding. i did it so the other guy would sleep with one eye open regardless, cuz YOU NEVER KNOW... 0_0 haha. Users/Kafani

20101207 20:40:07 nbsp can yall let me look up restaurant info in peace now? Its not that serious, honestly. get off the computer, and youll realize that nothing has happened...literally. Users/Kafani

20101207 21:00:04 nbsp Do not issue physical threats on the wiki, please. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845
