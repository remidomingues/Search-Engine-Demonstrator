You didnt explain in your http://daviswiki.org/Primary_Concepts_Tattooing_%26_Body_Piercing?actiondiff&date1211673037 edit  does Chris no longer work there?  Was he bought out?  He should be probably be mentioned on the page, but I dont know the history..  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100126 20:37:20 nbsp Why remove David Richardson Portfolio from the page? Users/JasonAller

20100203 18:31:03 nbsp Unfortunately, Dave decided to move back in with his folks down in Southern California. We are super bummed that he is not working at PriCon anymore, as is he. It was a bit too hard to find employment up here for his wife,a nd they could not afford it.
I have decided not to discuss the reasons WHY people leave or come to our shop on the Wiki. Its not necessarily things the general public needs to know. Its funny that both the comments on my PERSONAL page concern guys leaving my place of work and the reasons why.
I added Dave and his wife Tricia to the last of past employees/friends/folks on hiatus. Maybe I should address the issue more directly in the future.   Users/KaiSmart

20100203 19:36:23 nbsp The removal just took something away from the page. Maybe a section for art by past artists in residence would be in order? Users/JasonAller

20100203 20:27:20 nbsp Since we are in the business of art I dont think advertising art that you cant get at our shop would be a good idea. It would misrepresent what we offer. Maybe links to that past employees new place of business/personal site would work better?
I also am uploading a new (though smaller) portfolio for our apprentice right now. Hopefully that will add the something back to our page. I try to keep everything as current and comprehensive as possible.
Thanks for your attention though! Users/KaiSmart

20100203 20:49:31 nbsp Oh, I dont see the Wiki as advertising. I see it in terms of a collaboratively edited, interconnected community effort to explore, discuss and compile anything and everything about Davis  especially the little, enjoyable things. As such it is interesting to note that Stephen Hawking appeared at the Mondavi Center, even though you cant get tickets to see him there any more. In the same way I find it an interesting point about Primary Concepts that David Richardson once worked there. Users/JasonAller

 Before Nicks Comment 
20100203 21:22:40 nbsp Hi, I agree with you about the tattoo pictures possibly being confusing or misrepresentative. There has been a similar discussion on Creative Hair/Talk about having a picture of the staff there that includes a popular former employee. I think this is a little bit different because I think the tattoo pictures could have captions explaining about the artist overlooked more easily. Maybe a big heading would help like halloffame gallery or something? Users/NickSchmalenberger
 After Nicks Comment 

20100203 22:08:19 nbsp Thanks for your opinions Jason and Nick. Very good points. Perhaps (or actually DEFINITELY) advertising was the wrong word to use. Maybe educating would have been a better one. I understand what the Wiki is for, but the fact of the matter is that we use our page to educate people about the shop. I think most people look at it because they want information about what we do in terms of visiting us in the future. I field many questions on the other sites I represent us on (Myspace and Facebook primarily) that are caused by people not reading the captions of the pictures, or any text on the page, for that matter. If I have Daves tattoos up in a gallery I imagine I would have to answer even more questions from people who saw the images, didnt read our list of employees, and came into the shop expecting to get something that we cant offer. We want every experience in our shop to be a good one, and I dont want anyone to leave dismayed or dissatisfied.
Good points though. I just dont think people read things on the internet closely enough, bottom line.
On our Primary Concepts page we have a list of past employees and friends who have been associated with our shop in many different ways. I have put up the start of a new gallery which will hopefully fill in the empty space left by Daves. Hopefully he will come back to us after he and his wife have a bit of money to exist on while Dave builds his client base here. Users/KaiSmart
