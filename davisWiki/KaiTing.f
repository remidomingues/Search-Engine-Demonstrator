Kai has noticed that people like to talk about themselves in the third person in their profiles. Kai scoffs as this. Feel the wrath of Kai!

Kai is writing a novel. He has written four words so far, and they are: The luscious green grass. His novel is entitled The luscious green grass, and will be available at a bookstore near you, providing that youre near a Bookstores bookstore. When not working on the fifth word of his novel, Kai spends his time Bicycle Rides cycling and being a Gay Community homosapien.

Kai finds those who tote their opinions as absolutes to be irksome and a little bit crapsome. Like ... Blah blah bleh has the best Japanese food, as if their taste buds are definitive. Doesnt anyone know that Im the only one with definitive taste buds? The world is flat and it revolves around me.

Kai thinks every sidewalk crack in Davis should have its own page on the wiki, especially the mossy ones and the ones inclined to make people trip. This should probably be called the Sidewalk Crack Project. Because, if its not on the wiki, it does not exist.

Kai has a theory that creating a link to a nonexistent page on the wiki will result in someone creating that page. The page can be more trivial than trivia or utter nonsense. Kai will test his theory: The Effulgence of Biorhythmic Iceburgs in Lake Spafford.

Kai hates inhaling other peoples suicide. Kai also hates pretentious people who use big words like Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Kai likes the cold side of the pillow, and wishes someone would invent a rotisserie pillow. Kai thinks that the serrated knife is the greatest invention since sliced bread.

Kai likes that the daviswiki is an equal opportunity wiki, and that even the town idiots can put their two brain cells on display. Kai thinks that said people should wear bicycle helmets.
