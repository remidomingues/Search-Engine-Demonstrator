Kai SavareeRuess was an ASUCD Controller (20062007), succeeding Devin Whitney.  Prior to this, he held the title of Internal Affairs Commission Chair.

SavareeRuess, formerly an Academic Affairs Commissioner, unsuccessfully ran for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate on the Student Focus slate in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.  He worked in a LEAD executive office, for the enemy party.  Despite claims that he is a double agent, working to leak top secret Student Focus plans from the beginning, he might just be a single agent.  We really just dont know.

What we do know about Kai:
  Enjoys music, X long walks on the beach X long talks with Chris Herold
  A member of the FOSL Focus on Student LEADership slate
  He was appointed as controller because he has the will to do the job, the drive to get the job done, and the ability to work with everyone.
  He also ran in the ASUCD Mock Election 2006, but lost to Users/PaulHarms PMoney
  He has joked I seriously would think about killing a newborn kid before allowing more LEAD kids up Third Floor here. Soon thereafter Senator Amaha was quoted: He will pay for that. (1162006) As three LEAD Senators were subsequently elected, parents across Davis have been guarding their children more carefully than ever.
  The closed session on Kai was a result of a confrontation and alleged threat between himself and LEAD candidate Andrew Peake at the Coffee House during the ASUCD Senate debate.  The resulting argument led Senator Patel to call for a closed session.  |add aggie link/info|

Kai was appointed by President Darnell Holloway; the competition for the Office of the Controller included former ASUCD Senator Eric Fox and Director of ASUCD Refrigerator Services Alex Li.  Kai was confirmed as the 20052006 Chair of the Internal Affairs Commission on June 2^nd^, 2005; he was later confirmed as the Controller on April 6^th^ 2006.  Congratulations, Kai!

A closed session was called on Kai on Thursday November 9th, 2006, which everybody knew was about the threatening of Andrew Peake (go see that page for discussion on that issue).  Nothing happened.  The ASUCD Court later determined that the closed session should have been public, but the recorder has never turned in those minutes.

20061109 00:08:28 nbsp Do you feel it worthwhile to speculate about this on Facebook?  I think Schwab should help to end the speculation if he really knows something. Users/SteveOstrowski
