20140702 07:49:40 nbsp I cannot say enough great things about Kaia Fit Davis! I have a lower back injury so I need a few modifications. I never have been made to feel like I should be able to do something by the coaches or the other ladies in class. If there is something I cannot do or shouldnt do a modifications is always waiting for me to keep me moving. I have been enjoying Kaia for just a little over 3 months and have seen great results! I am stronger today then I was yesterday kind of feeling! The camaraderie and encouragement you are surrounded with at Kaia stands out ten fold to any other program out there! It will not disappoint!
