20110620 14:48:20 nbsp Hi Kaleena  let me give you a belated welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for the message on my page.  Im afraid there is something that youre still not understanding about how the wiki works.  You dont control the content of the wiki page, even though its an organization youre associated with, any more than you would control a news article that the Enterprise wrote about you.  (Even though youre not a business, you might want to read Welcome to the wiki/business owner, since the issues are similar).  The wiki is a bit better than the newspaper in the sense that you can work collaboratively with other editors to try to come to a consensus about how a page should look, but you, or others with your triathlon team, dont get to determine how the page looks.  So, I am going to revert some of the changes that you just made to the page; there should not be a special, segregated community area  the whole page belongs to, and is edited by the community.  And your triathlon team does not get to decide what does, and does not stay.  If you disagree with other editors edits, then you should try to explain your reasons and come to a consensus.  If you need a lengthy discussion, sometimes its best to create a Talk page by clicking the Talk button at the top of the page in question; that way, different editors can chime in if necessary.  Again, welcome to the wiki!  Im glad youve been working on the page; sounds like a great group that youve got there! Users/CovertProfessor

20110620 16:31:06 nbsp Thanks for the welcome! Aha~ #9. Got it.

I consider the team my second family and thus have given as much as I could back to it as possible. As a last gift to my team, I wanted to update the wiki page, hence the previous conversations. I have notified some of the main officers who will continue to add and update information for hopefully many years to come. I have a feeling that the officers and members will mostly be editing information, so is there a way to open a comments section for people to share experiences, etc? (Like the one were chatting on now and the ones on restaurants?) Users/KaleenaJackson

20110620 16:40:21 nbsp Kaleena, thats great!  Im glad to hear that more edits will be coming, and thanks for understanding about the pictures.  The wiki is really a new sort of creature for most people, so it can take a little bit of time to figure out what its about.

A comment bar can be added to any page by adding this bit of code:  {{{Comments}}}

However, I would encourage people to add their experiences directly on the page  there doesnt need to be a segregation of facts and opinion, since it is all meant to reflect the communitys (sometimes diverse) points of view.  If you poke around, youll see that some of the restaurant pages do include experiences, opinions, etc., in the main body of the text.  The main value of the comment box is to help out people who are intimidated by having to use the wiki editing codes. Users/CovertProfessor

20110620 16:44:32 nbsp Well then, the comment bar will be a good choice... I know a lot of students dont feel like creating yet another account to something. Users/KaleenaJackson
  Unfortunately, they will still need to create an account even just to leave a comment.  I would then encourage them to stick around the wiki and add to other things they know and have experienced about Davis (you too!)   Users/CovertProfessor
  Darn... I forgot about that part. I guess its just an easy GUI feature. Users/KaleenaJackson
     Yep!  :)   Users/CovertProfessor
