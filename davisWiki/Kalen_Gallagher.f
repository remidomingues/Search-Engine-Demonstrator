 ASUCD Activity 
Kalen is originally from San Jose, California and attended Westmont High School.  An ambitious young man, he emailed all the thencurrent ASUCD ASUCD Senate senators before arriving here for his Freshman freshman year.  When negotiating with Lee Weissman about running on Weissmans Unite slate that quarter, Gallagher allegedly informed him you can have me on your slate or not, but either way I am going to run and I am going to win.

Gallagher subsequently served on Senate from 200102 (winning a seat his Freshman year), Vice President 0304, and President 0405.  So far the only time he has not been an ASUCD elected official was during the months between the end of his Fall quarter term and the winter election in which he was elected Vice President.

He is also believed to have invented campaigning via AIM, establishing several accounts every election compiled of every available screen name of students at UCD and mass messaging them.

In his http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2005/03/14/FrontPage/Asucd.Executive.Officers.Bid.Farewell1319932.shtml farewell statements as ASUCD President, Kalen stated When youre in elections its easy to continually think about all the different slates and independents. He said You shouldnt worry about what ticket youre on once youre elected. Just work together. Were all Aggies and thats a strong thing to have in common.  Gallagher also voiced his opposition to the Choice Voting system.
