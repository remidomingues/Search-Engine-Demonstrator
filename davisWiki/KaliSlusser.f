 My dream car is a Hybrid Vehicles Prius.  I think I will steal my friend Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelles!

 I am opposed to the Dollar Tree moving into my neighborhood. I refuse to shop there and I hope my neighbors will do the same! Vote  with your dollars!

  I love shopping at the Naked Thread downtown and of course The CoOp.
