Describe Users/Kanako here.
Hi Kanako, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for adding information to The Fitnessgarage page.  In its current state, it seems very promotional (glossy in wiki parlance, a reference to glossy flyers), which is actually a violation of WikiSpots (and thus Davis Wikis) nonprofit agreement with the IRS.  Please take a moment to look over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions pages.  Both provide a lot of useful information.  The key point here, though, is that things like flyers that would be used to advertise for a company are generally a problem.  If you could provide information on what sort of classes are offered from an educational/informative standpoint, rather than a promotional one (including replacing the flyer images), it would be a huge improvement.  Its also possible other users will hop in and help out with shaping the page to be a bit less promotional.  Its not an insult or an attack or anything; its just a part of the collaborative editing process which is what makes the wiki such a great resource.  If you have any problems or questions, dont hesitate to ask. Users/TomGarberson
