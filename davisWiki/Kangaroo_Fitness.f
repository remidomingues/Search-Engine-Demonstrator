20120810 15:43:48 nbsp Ive been attending classes almost from the beginning with my almostyear old son and its been a life saver. I got majorly out of shape after the birth and these workouts have made a huge difference. I feel better and can see major changes in my body. I had tried a gym before learning about KF but it was too hard to get regular workouts in when I needed child care each time, worrying about breast feeding needs and how long I was gone, etc. Being able to bring my baby and integrating workouts with for him, fun times in the stroller has been The Only way Ive been able to get back into shape. The workouts are varied and Raychel and Dana have always managed to tailor it to what I needed to feel challenged without overdoing it.  Theyve been able to do this even when the group has included people at very different levels. Finally the range of times and locations of classes has made sure I can make at least 2 or 3 classes a week. The amount of personal attention and opportunity to get my baby out with me for varied exercise has made KF a far better and economical option than a gym membership, and more interesting and challenging than just running on my own. And its fun to hang out with other parents and great to get to know Raychel and Dana, who are terrific. I cant say enough great things about this service! Users/Dora5
