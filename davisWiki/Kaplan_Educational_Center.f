20081112 15:05:28 nbsp I know nothing about Kaplans LSAT course, but once upon a time, I had medical school aspirations and i took Kaplans MCAT course (circa 2002).  I took the full classroom course and it was fantastic.  All of the instructors were effective and dynamic teachers.  They  were also interesting people.  Kaplan had to teach me physics because I hadnt learned from UCDs horrendous Physics 7 series.  Even now, i believe Im richer for the experience.

I credit Kaplan for my good score (35, which was decent at that time, anyway).  I was not a cookiecutter premed with perfect grades and perfect everything.  Standardized tests were never my thing as I am severely attentiondeficit.

So for all of you wanting to got medical school, I highly recommend Kaplans MCAT course.  Especially, for those of you who are determined to apply to medical school, but have borderline/low science grades.  The MCAT can turn things around for you.  Take Kaplan and take the classes seriously.  A strong MCAT score is a great way to prove to the admissions boards that you have academic potential to succeed in medical school.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20090408 17:37:20 nbsp I cant say enough about these people. I took their LSAT prep course and raised my score by 5 points. In addition to score improvement, you really feel more comfortable the day of the test. These guys are consummate professionals. Not only do they care about you in class; whenever I wasnt in class I was getting texts and IMs from the instructor asking me how studying was going and if there was anything he could do to help. Now thats going the extra mile. They also offer free classes on personal statements when youre a student there and the support staff always made me feel welcome. Cannot go wrong with these folks.
