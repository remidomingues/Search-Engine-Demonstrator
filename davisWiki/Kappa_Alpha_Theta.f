History
Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle, Indiana on January 27, 1870, making it the first Greek letter fraternity for women (The word sorority was not coined until after Kappa Alpha Theta was founded).

Bettie Locke was one of the first women admitted to Asbury in 1867, and she believed that uniting with other female students in pursuit of similar goals would greatly enrich their college experience. She was familiar with the fraternity lifestyle, as her father was a member of Beta Theta Pi and her brother of Phi Gamma Delta. Impressed with the fraternity ideals, Bettie searched for a womens counterpart. Finding none, she shared her vision with Alice Allen, Bettie Tipton, and Hannah Fitch, and the four of them together founded Kappa Alpha Theta. Together, they wrote a constitution, planned ceremonies, designed a badge, and sought other women on campus worthy of membership. These four pioneering women initiated themselves on January 27, 1870, becoming the first Greekletter fraternity known among women.

The founders proudly wore their black and gold badges to Asburys chapel service on March 14. The Alpha Chapter at Asbury quickly grew to 22 sisters. Later that year, Kappa Alpha Theta expanded past Asbury, as they established a Beta chapter at Indiana University. In the more than 130 years since, Kappa Alpha Theta has grown to 123 chapters all across the United States and Canada. The number of total initiated members is more than 170,000. The strong friendships within chapters and across the continent are what hold the fraternity together.

“We had to make a place for all who would follow.”

 Philanthropy 
Overall, UCD Panhellenic sororities raise over $42,000 each year for various causes. Theta runs an annual communitywide Rock Our CASA, to benefit Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). CASA is Kappa Alpha Thetas national philanthropy.

CASAs are trained community volunteers appointed by a judge to speak up for abused and neglected children in court. With the information provided by CASA volunteers, judges are able to make informed decisions as to what is best for the child  foster care, reunification, or adoption, and in a more timely fashion, so these children still have a chance at childhood.


Rock Our CASA is Thetas annual Fall back yard concert centered around music, food, and fun. In the past Theta has featured local musical acts such as The Safe Boiz, The Dirt Feelin, Walking Spanish, and UC Davis all female acapella group The Spokes. The event is catered by local resturants such as Tommy Js.

Theta also organizes an allmale beauty pageant called Mr. Casanova in the Winter. The pageant features UC Davis finest fraternity men competing for the title of Mr. Casanova representing their fraternity, and coached by Theta members.

In addition to raising money for CASA, Thetas regularly participate in local community service events sponsored by students groups along with actively participating in other Greek philanthropy events.

In Spring 2012 Theta participated in Relay for Life and raised more money than any other team.
