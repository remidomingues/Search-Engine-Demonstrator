History


Kappa Gamma Delta began during the winter quarter of 1993 at the University of California, Davis when students Charlene Tran and Marge Lee envisioned a professional sorority that would provide support for women during the premedical process. Our founding mothers are Maricris Belisario, Chong Choe, Mindy Compton, Pamela Hy, Marge Lee, Kathy Pham, Jennifer Skinkle (now Jennifer Schwartz), Charlene Tran, Gwen Tran, Aileen Tiew, Carolyn Trieu, and Julie Tse.




Since its inception, Kappa Gamma Delta has provided female college students with a source of academic, social, and emotional support. Between our alumnae network, close ties with the community, and a diverse sisterhood, we are able to provide our members with everything they need to be successful in life. Kappa Gamma Delta offers its sisters an environment that stresses the balance between hard work and fun, and gives its members plenty of chances to do both.
