Hello, Im Kapril. (Yes, Kapril, sound it out now, Kaypril. And yes, thats my real name, and no I did not misspell it....) Im a 23 yearold, senior UC Davis student majoring in psychology. I love the Davis Wiki  it is a great tool for anyone who lives in Davis, although I mostly only lurk around.
I am originally from SoCal (Ventura to be exact) and miss the cool, beachy weather it offers.

         Also, it seems he graduated in 2004. I graduated high school in 2005, so theres a large(ish) age gap :)

20101027 21:54:49 nbsp I suggest trying The Dumpling House again.  I went for the first time a couple of months ago and it was absolutely fantastic.  Maybe you visited them on a bad day! Users/TomGarberson

20101028 14:32:01 nbsp Kapril, I recently read your comment on Lucis Salon wiki page. It is clear you are a smart woman!  I used to work at Lucis and moved on due to the horrible reputation associated with the business. I now work at Vita Dolce on F street. If you would like to get a rockin finished look, in a salon with edge and class, come see me. You will not be dissapointed :)  Users/KristinAprilHernandez
