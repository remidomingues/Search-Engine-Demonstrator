Karaoke is the ancient Japanese art of looking like an idiot while intoxicated.  It is also a fantastic time with friends, and you can sometimes hear incredible talent.  Literally meaning empty orchestra, you are handed a microphone and sing the lyrics presented to you on a screen while a track with low or nonexistant vocals accompany you.  Its a great way to get to know people better and satisfy your secret fantasy of being Frank Sinatra.  Even if you sound like Jerry Lewis.

Sometimes youll run into some really interesting characters, like Jimmy the Carrot or Lamar Heystek.


Going Out

Karaoke is available on various nights at locations around town.

  Tuesdays  G St. Wunderbar and Plainfield Station
  Thursdays  Sushi Unlimited and Dawsons in Dixon
  Fridays  Froggys and Sushi Unlimited
  Saturdays  Sushi Unlimited

There are also many places in Sacramento that offer karaoke, notably Faces.



 G Street Wunderbar 

Karaoke starts at 9pm at G Street, but doesnt really get going until after 10.  Karaoke night at bars means no cover.  You can transpose music to lower or higher keys (1/2step increments) in case your vocal range wont quite let you hit those high or low notes.

Every 1st Thursday of the month: Live Band Karaoke (Full live band, you pick the song and get to be the lead singer).  Kicks off around 9:30 or so.


 Plainfield Station 
Every Tuesday

Karaoke Begins at 8PM and goes until Midnight (a bit later if theres a crowd)  The song selection is the same as the show at G St. pub, so if youre used to that show youre in luck!
Get there early and try the Tacos!


 Dawsons 
In Dixon

Karaoke every Thursday night 8:30PM to 12AM   Huge song list and a great crowd!  The building is over 150 years old but still a great place to hang out!


Staying In

Theres no need to go out to sing, you can get a machine or machine and DJ for your party.  Karaoke parties can be fun with the right crowd of people but be forewarned, you will hear Total Eclipse of the Heart no fewer than 3 times before the night is ended.

You can rent a karaoke machine from http://www.klinemusic.com Kline Music (right across the street from Sacramento City College Sac City College in Sacramento).  Its $35 a night to rent just the machine (with 2 microphones) from them if you need a monitor, its $15 extra (but the monitor isnt necessary if youve got a TV with A/V input theyll even supply the cables).  The rental price includes 5 CDGs (which each have about 1015 songs) , but you can rent extras for $2 each.

E. Brattesani Enterprises also offers karaoke services. Unconfirmed

Most Karaoke DJs (or KJs) who work out of bars sometimes hire out for parties; just ask them for their card.
