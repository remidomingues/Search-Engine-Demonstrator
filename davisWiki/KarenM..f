Karen M. is currently a second year student. She is quite multitalented: she writes amazing pieces of prose (both fiction and non) and poetry, and occasionally rocks out on the piano and the cello. Karen writes for The California Aggie, works for Campus Unions Programs and is an academic advisor for The First Resort. She can speak Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, French, and Spanish. When not rushing from class to class, Karen is usually stealing trashy periodicals from Borders, participating in latenight pizza runs to Woodstocks Pizza or partying it up with her roommate. Above everything else, Karen is the guiding light of Nameless Magazine, a new online literary publication for the writers and artists of UC Davis.

20100302 02:00:26 nbsp I understand, but the page was removed at the request of the authors it mentions  it was a mistake on my part putting it up to begin with, and while I believe in the community purpose the wiki serves, I certainly do not believe that it needs to infere in matters that have been personally requested to remain private. The Untitled Project was never a venture that specifically pertained to Davis and it does not, nor has it ever, established firm ties in the Davis campus or community for the fact that its two authors met and attended school here.

20100302 07:57:45 nbsp Uh, there are no wiki overlords.  There are just a bunch of neighbors volunteering, pitching in and working together.  Nobody has any more say over content than you do.  So, youre the ominous wiki overlord you speak of.  Youre working with a bunch of individuals who all signed up to edit, just like you, and who all have the same rights to the content of the wiki, just like you. (And it hurt the feelings of at least one community volunteer  not myself  to be referred to as some kind of overlord).  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
