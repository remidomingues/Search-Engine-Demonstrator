20100120 16:25:06 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. It will explain why your edits are going to be reverted. Users/JasonAller

20100120 17:58:52 nbsp Karen, Im sorry that the earlier message was so short, but now Im in front of a keyboard and can explain a little better. I looked at your http://daviswiki.org/Users/KarenMattis?actionuserinfo edit history and saw that youd been around the wiki for a while even though all your edits are on one page so far. I glanced at the edits you were making and saw that youd removed content, links, and formatting from the page. I thought Id give you a heads up that those edits were going to be reverted, and I see that someone has done that. I want to reach out and explain why. If you read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page it will explain a little bit of general information. In addition to that Ill go on to explain a few other bits. The {{{||}}} characters that were at the start and end of lines near the top of the page are the way that the wiki knows to display something as a table. The words in {{{square brackets and quotes}}} are links, and I see you removed a bunch of those while you were editing. Images can be quite large when the are uploaded and then formatted to display using the image macro: {{{Image(photo.jpg, right, thumbnail, 400)}}}. Let us know if you have questions, but Please Remember to Preview. Users/JasonAller

20100212 14:21:17 nbsp The photo was restored because to remove it disrespects the efforts of the photographer. Users/JasonAller

20100401 15:11:24 nbsp How about you stop removing the photo? I see the http://daviswiki.org/The_Arbors?actionFiles&doview&targetThe%20Arbors.png photo that you want to replace the old one with. It is low resolution, poorly scaled, supersaturated, and in a file format unsuitable for a photograph. Users/WilliamLewis

20100401 15:53:53 nbsp Can you please stop editing The Arbors? Youve been here for months and you havent yet made an edit that didnt make the page worse. Users/WilliamLewis

20100401 19:55:09 nbsp Karen have you read the messages for you on this page? Users/JasonAller

20100401 20:04:42 nbsp I think the point can be summed up this way: all of the wiki pages  including pages about businesses  are cowritten by members of the Davis community and meant to reflect the multiple perspectives of the Davis community.  They are not free advertisements.  While businesses are encouraged to contribute, they have to work with the rest of the community on the content of pages. Users/CovertProfessor

20100401 21:17:54 nbsp Ms. Mattis, do not attempt to contact me outside of Davis Wiki again. Any discussion about content on here needs to take place in public where the entire wiki community can read it. Users/WilliamLewis

20100401 21:39:17 nbsp I think that William is frustrated that youve been coming to the wiki to edit only the page about The Arbors and it has been three years and youve not bothered to learn some very basic things about the wiki or ever contribute anything anywhere else on this wiki of over 15,000 pages.

To an editor who came here to help the entire wiki grow, encountering someone who only edits for their own monetary interest is rife with potential conflict. You or someone at the Arbors pays for them to have a website; on that site you can do whatever you want. Here on the wiki it is a free community resource; your history of edits shows that you dont understand that. The page about The Arbors is a community resource, not an advertisement. Taking a good photo off of it and putting one of lesser quality back without proper formatting is vandalism. Vandalism gets reverted. Users/JasonAller

20100405 10:37:44 nbsp Dear Jason and William,

Thank you for your comments, thanks for sending me this link Jason, I had not seen it before.  I contacted both of you off the Wiki site as I did not get a response when I posted a comment on your page, I apologize if that was disrespectful in any way, that was certainly not my intent.  I do only edit the Arbors pagebecause I am the manager and I want to get out as much info to people has possible with the most updated photos.  I understand that this is a community website and I cannot change/alter/delete comments, I thought I was permitted to add info on to the page such as the texting info/rent up info.  Thanks again for the info.
