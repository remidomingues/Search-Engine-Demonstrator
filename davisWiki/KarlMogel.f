About Karl
This weirdo used to write the Science Column for The California Aggie, hosts a radio show on KDRT, and used to keep Honeybees at the EC Garden Experimental College Community Garden, where he tended a controversial Mogel Engineering garden. He has aspirations of a combocareer in plant genetics and in science journalism. Pursuing this goal, Karl applied and has been admitted to a Ph.D. program in Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, starting in June 2007. He and Users/ArielaHaro Ariela MadisonDavis Airlift departed Davis for Madison on May 23rd. Karl currently resides in Madison, Wisconsin, and has founded the wiki:madison: Front Page Madison Wiki.

He is also one of the people on the wiki that likes to write his own wiki page in the third person.

Karl is an elemental sorcerer who specializes in the dark arts of Apiarimancy.  In his traditional white robes, he summons and dispatches the hive with deft control over the natural world.  Do not cross him, or you may feel the sting of his anger.

Karl has often been referred to as a Renaissance Man, as he has picked up numerous skills in the quartercentury that he has been living among humans. These include woodworking, sewing, a little website coding, cooking like crazy, boating skills, audio/video recording and mixing, and everyones favorite, constructing doomsday devices. You can see some of his creations here on this page, or periodically appearing on his website. Ixnay on ellingtay the edsFay about the oomsdayday evicesday.

The Inoculated Mind

This was the name that Karl came up with for his The California Aggie Aggie column back in 2002, which refers to a mind that has been infected with ideas, as opposed to a sterile mind. Mental sterility with regard to a subject is synonymous with ignorance, and thus it became Karls mission to inoculate people with facts and ideas about scientific topics. Some people have taken inoculated to mean smart, but it just means full of ideas. The title lent itself to so many useful metaphors that Karl decided to keep it for his future writings. Interestingly enough, in the middle of his first year writing for the Aggie, the Editor in Chief decided to remove the fun titles that everyone had under their column mugshots, but since Karls column was deemed educational he got to keep his. Image(screenshot.jpg, Whose brain is that?, right, thumbnail) In 2005, Karl elected not to continue writing for the Aggie to pursue other writing opportunities. Taking the theme to the extreme, Karl now maintains a http://www.inoculatedmind.com weblog of the same name as the column, that features fMRI scans of his own brain, and his thoughts rolling out underneath.

In 2004, a new community radio station opened up in town, KDRT, and Karl was one of the first to hop on board and host a show. Now over 2 years running, The Inoculated Mind Radio & Mindcast combines weekly science news, interviews with scientists and intellectuals, wrapped up in rotating theme music selected from science fiction films, shows, and video games. (Ok, just one video game  Halo.) Karl tacked Mindcast onto the title when he launched the podcast version of the show in August, 2005. Before the mindcast, every show began with Citizens of Davis (and UC Davis). Now, every episode begins with Citizens of Earth... The show aired live every Thursday evening from 18001930 hours, and Sunday evenings it replayed from 21002230. (67:30 pm live, 910:30 pm sunday replay) Karls last live Davis show aired on May 10, 2007. Although the show has stopped airing, as soon as Karl gets it going again in Madison, you may be able to hear it again in Davis!

  Accessing the internet from a tent in a campground is AWESOME. (this comment was made in South Dakota. In a tent. Yeah.)
  With days left to go, Im so excited about going to graduate school that I cant even make this sentence dramatic!
  Applying for graduate school is a fulltime job. I only spent half of February even in Davis.

Karl hasnt been in the Aggie this often since he wrote for the Aggie. Still, heres news http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/04/19/CityNews/CityOf.Davis.Backs.Local.Radio.Station2852762.shtml #1 and http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/04/26/ScienceTech/Honeybees.Disappearing.Throughout.World2882649.shtml #2.

Image(newwikiproject.jpg, Already has over 200 pages. Okay, theyre all stubs. But its 200 stubs!, left, thumbnail, 318)  02/23/2007  With the help of Users/PhilipNeustrom, Karl has started a sciencerelated wiki project. Called the wiki:dnawiki: Front Page DNA Wiki, someday it will be the quintessential guide to genetics, biology, and biotechnology for everyone who wants to know more about these fields.
 
 
11/29/2006  Karl participated in a panel, and got to ask questions of Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivores Dilemma. http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/11/29/CampusNews/Omnivores.Dilemma.Author.To.Lead.Panel.Discussion.Address.Book.At.Mondavi.Center2512264.shtml?norewrite200612132136&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com (Aggie story) His newlystitched corn shirt also debuted at this event. Michael Pollan noticed the visual metaphor from his book and pointed it out to audience members. Michael Pollan may soon come on Karls radio show for an interview.
 
08/06/2006  Karl made the http://davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/08/16/news/137new1.txt local paper for an impromptu experiment he conducted on bees during the West Nile mosquito spraying, 2006.

04/01/2005  Karls latest experiment goes horribly wrong.
The police came and went before we could really see what happened. Leslie took a picture of the outlines. Apparently an unsuspecting scientist harvesting seeds was crushed by a variety of Solanum lycopersicum previously unknown to science. The plant fled the scene and local authorities are searching beehives for pollen to track down the suspect. The tomato is believed to be sweet, meaty, and “branched and dangerous.

20070907 18:28:46 nbsp Yup, here in Nittany Valley, it was August 18th and 19th.  I used to drive Sarah in to her office on campus after going out for coffee every morning.  Suddenly I was facing a wall of undergraduates, scooters and motorcycles (which are very popular around these parts, given the hills and mountains).  Ill raise a glass to you this winter, fellow snowbound exDavisite. Users/JabberWokky

20070907 20:25:12 nbsp Ill let you know when it snows Users/KarlMogel

20070909 15:34:09 nbsp Well, while I dont take it seriously, Steve did threaten to hurt me when the time is right...is that enough for a full ban? Users/JamesSchwab

20070909 15:38:02 nbsp He may have meant to hurt you in the political sense. Hard to say considering he is neither physically, mentally, or politically intimidating! Users/KarlMogel
      I think thats what they said about the Columbine kids.  Users/JamesSchwab

20070909 15:48:11 nbsp Uh oh... someone needs to keep an eye out at the MU, in case Steve goes bowling. Users/KarlMogel

20070909 16:50:59 nbsp I think the comment SO left on his own page to William: I have no interest in you. As far as I am concerned you are a troll and an annoyance. You bring nothing of value to any of my activity pages or ASUCD pages. You attack me while you hide behind your user page and nonexistent reputation. —SteveOstrowski sums up how he views the DavisWiki most clearly.   Also, I left the comment on the talk but the edit by Jose was on the actual page, Steve deleted it mid revert and decided itd fit best on the talk page apparently.  Users/EdWins
  That pretty much sums up his whole purpose on the wiki  its all about his pages. Hopefully the Admins of the Sac Wiki wont have to deal with the kinds of problems that have happened here. It will be less personal for him there, but still possible.

20070911 00:29:57 nbsp I was talking to Danielle Fodor about djs from KDRT and she said that you did cute show with Ariela! how come i didnt know about this?!!!
i miss you both. when you come to cali, you best let me know. Users/JessicaRockwell

20071025 21:34:14 nbsp when are the blogs going to be available? i want to get educated. Users/JessicaRockwell

20071030 22:31:45 nbsp i meant the blog that ariela started. but if you get podcasts up, im down to listen to those as well. congrats on possibly being on the radio again!  Users/JessicaRockwell

20071112 16:13:26 nbsp congradulations on getting into University of Wisconsin. I here it is an excellent school and a gorgeous city. Users/MattHh

20080127 22:39:57 nbsp Holy moly, hey Karl.  Im traveling around (aka being pampered) interviewing with graduate programs  planning to stick to microbio/pathogenesis and all that fun stuff :D  In the meantime Ive been cloning/playing around with genomic DNA for a small biotech startup in the Bay Area.  Human stuff, I never really got interested in plants :P  Thought Id just drop a line and say hi, hope everything is going well up in Madison!  If I wasnt trying to stay within California, I would have applied up there, they have a nice program. I still check your site at least once a month! Users/EdWins
