063006  23:59:59  Karla, I havent began my time at Davis yet, but I too am addicted to DavisWiki and check it many times throughout the day.  So now, when you next check it...youll get to see that     your OWN page has received a hit :)    Users/BobbyGray
I leave that comment just as you remove the part about being addicted from your page....well anyway, good luck with your todo list. Users/BobbyGray
