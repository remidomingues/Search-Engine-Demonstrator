The Karma Patrol is the name for all of the volunteers that make the Whole Earth Festival possible. This is the name of the volunteers going back to the 70s (except for the years 19992005 when it was called Chaos Control). The Karma Patrol is a stellar Davis tradition, with around 300400 funloving volunteers each year that realize what is more fun than just attending is to be part of the behindthescenes makings of this annual free festival!

Is it possible for high school students to participate in karma patrol?   Users/JulienBiewerElstob

  High school students have generaly been allowed in the past. Go to a meeting to join, or call the Experimental College to find out more.   Users/ColinWalsh

20070709 22:17:28 nbsp I wish to register a complaint against the name Chaos Control. It implies that chaos is somehow bad, and is likely to offend chaoists, chaosophers, Discordians, and like ilk. Users/BarnabasTruman

20070709 22:38:23 nbsp The complaint is dully noted; Since the name Chaos Control is not in use, this seems like a quibble with no particular relevance. Users/DougWalter

20070710 09:46:36 nbsp I know people now dont have to worry about it, but what about the oppressed chaosfriendly of the 70s, 80s, and 90s? For their sakes, could we retroactively change the name? Users/BarnabasTruman

20070711 09:12:17 nbsp I understand that youre makikng a joke. The name was Karma Patrol until at least 1993. Now you get to make a stupid comment about how oppressive the six years were prospectively for the chaosfriendly in previous decades. Users/DougWalter

20071112 20:00:28 nbsp Have you any idea how arrogant using the name Karma Patrol makes you sound? I guess you dont or you wouldnt have used it. Ill let you guys into a little secret  among the vendor community you guys are the laughing stock. Want to know why you always sell out  of booth spaces and people put up with your silly/arrogant rules  money  we earn a lot of it at your show  no other reason. With out that, wed all tell you where to put your selfrighteous rules. but while we are make good sales, we are going to keep smiling at you sweetly (and giving you the finger behind your back) See you in May. Users/CcitizenSmith
    Hahaha, this cracks me up.  I always figured there were vendors who felt this way. 
    Hey, feel like using your real name to back up your words?  Or are you just going to insult others while hiding behind the internet?   Users/BrentLaabs
        What  so you can throw me out of your show?  I dont think so. Are you going to censure my comments again?  thats not very American of you  Im not insulting you, Im telling you what the vendors really think about you  sorry if it hurts  try going to another show and asking what the vendors think about your show  make sure not to tell them how you are and I think youll find out that im speaking the truth  sorry if it hurts. Users/CcitizenSmith
     Its somewhat ironic that at the perhaps more conservative Picnic Day everything is free and at hippie The Earth Festival the place is packed with vendors trying to make money. I avoid the Earth Festival because of that and the crowds. Users/JimEvans

20111001 19:06:30 nbsp I really want to join Karma Patrol this year! Users/Tparkeressig
