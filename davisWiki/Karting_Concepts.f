Karting Concepts is a local racing go kart business based in Davis. They build custom racing karts, for local and national customers. Karts range from kid karts all the way to TaG karts and shifter karts. They also have an online store for parts. Coming soon will be a rental and racing school to be operated at the Blue Max Kart Club here in Davis.
