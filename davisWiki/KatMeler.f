Kat Meler is a liontamer and a lady.

  Do you use whispers and mesmerism, or are you old school, with khaki shirt and pants, pith helmet slung over your back, a chair in one hand and a whip in the other?   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

 Mesmerism and whispers, but studied with the Old Masters. Good to know ones way around the classics, if only for good form. k
