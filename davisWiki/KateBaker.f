Kate Baker recently graduated with a degree in Optical Science and Engineering, and also completed a Minors minor in Communication, thus making her a walking contradiction.  She was a peer advisor for the College of Engineering, a member and oficer for Tau Beta Pi, a member section leader, and officer for the California Aggie Marching Banduh, and Undergraduate Students undergrad labor for a laser lab in EU II.  In other words, shes busy.  And a dork.

She can usually be found in the company of the Wookiee, aka Users/DennisMuldoon Dennis Muldoon.  Both of them are now living in San Diego, where Kate is attending graduate schol.  They miss Davis, and will be trying to visit often.
