Dear UC Davis Students,

I know from those of you I spoke with on Friday and Saturday, and from the many students who shared their poignant stories at last weeks regents meeting, how deeply concerned you are about the recently approved increases in student fees.  I understand the anxiety that higher fees are causing and the uncertainty you are feeling about your own and your families futures.  And I share your worry about the states steady disinvestment in public higher education  a disinvestment that provides UC half as much inflationadjusted funding today as in 1990, UC Davis Budget Cuts that cut this years budget by an unprecedented 30 percent just this past May, and that puts at risk the Master Plans promise of high quality, accessible and affordable higher education to all Californians.

You have every right to be upset and angry.  Our faculty and staff do, too; theyve been subjected to furloughs and layoffs, and some of them are also paying higher fees for their UCenrolled children.  Cuts to academic programs and to student services are concerns to us all.

But what we do with our energy and emotion is critical to the universitys future.  For all the measures in place to mitigate the fees impact  including expanded financial aid and a $1 billion scholarship campaign  we must, together, aggressively remind the state of its responsibilities.  We must work together and make our voices heard in Sacramento.

As I was returning from the regents meeting last Friday, I was glad to hear that many of you attended a forum at the ARC to learn more about the budget and to share your concerns, which were relayed to me.  I was glad to hear, as well, that those of you who marched and those of you who chose to be arrested in support of your convictions were orderly and respectful in your protest and cooperative with law officers.  I hope that the Yolo County District Attorney, who has sole responsibility for determining whether to file charges, will take that behavior into consideration when making his decision.

Its important that we stay informed and that we stay united.  On Wednesday, AGTV ( http://www.facebook.com/aggietvfan ) will provide me with an opportunity to discuss the budget crisis and the events of last week.  And next Monday, November 30, the fallquarter Student Dialogue with the Chancellor will take place at 5:30 p.m. in the ARC Ballroom.  I hope youll join me and Provost Enrique Lavernia then for continued constructive dialogue.

Most importantly, I urge you to join me and our faculty, staff, alumni and parents in directing your voices to Sacramento.  I hope you will join the ranks of the nearly 200,000 advocates who already have lent their support to UC.  Please sign up on the UC for California Web site ( http://www.ucforca.org ) and write the governor in support of the $900 million restoration were seeking from the state.  We need your help with all kinds of advocacy efforts  email campaigns, legislative lobbying, perhaps a march on Sacramento.  If we speak with one voice in support of UC, we can best help preserve the University of California as an accessible and affordable public university of the highest quality.

Sincerely,

Linda P.B. Katehi
Chancellor
