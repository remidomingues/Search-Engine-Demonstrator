20080112 13:52:14 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. The graphics you just uploaded arent being seen as graphics because of the file extension. Instead of {{{.gif_png_gif}}} they should either be {{{.gif}}} or {{{.png}}} to be seen as graphic files. Users/JasonAller

20080209 15:54:02 nbsp I couldnt decode either of the files you uploaded. What program were they created with, and what format were they in? If you were trying to add a map showing where the store is you can do that with the {{{Address()}}} macro. Someone has already in fact used that macro to map where Volleys Tennis Shop is. Look for the map button near the edit button. Users/JasonAller

  It appears to be a Word document.  Im as surprised as anyone.  ct
