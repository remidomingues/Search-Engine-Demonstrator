20110809 17:20:15 nbsp Hi Katherine, and Welcome to the Wiki.  Please take a minute to read over Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner this pageit highlights some important points about the wiki.  First and foremost, as a nonprofit, its prohibited from the IRS by being used for promotion of forprofit businesses.  Your edits to Hyatt Place UC Davis read just like a flyer or website promoting the hotelwhat we call glossy on the Wiki.  That sort of thing is specifically prohibited, so I undid or altered a number of the changes you made to be less promotional.

Thanks for editing, and feel free to ask anywhere if you have any questions. Users/TomGarberson
