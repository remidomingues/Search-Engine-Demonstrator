 Candidate Statement 

Hey Ags,

My name is Katie Sherman and I am a second year nutrition major from San Diego running for Senate. I believe we all deserve to have the college experience we always dreamed of and I hope to provide that for every Aggie. I’m excited to be a part of our student government and help improve our campus climate with immediate results. On campus I am involved in Greek Life, hold a club board position, and aided in putting on the Finals Stress Free Fair last spring.

I want people to feel comfortable speaking with me about their concerns and interests on campus in order to aid the daytoday Aggie.

PROVIDING HEALTHIER FOOD OPTIONS WHILE ON CAMPUS

UC Davis is one of the greenest campuses regarding the environment, but what about our own bodies? I want to work with student housing to provide a wider range of snack options in first year convenience stores that are healthier and will better fuel the minds on our campus. In addition, I hope to reach out to the silo and provide a meal option other than fast food. Something with grease will always taste good, but in order to keep our students healthy and minds sharp it shouldn’t be an everyday choice. I want to make eating healthy between classes easy, convenient, and affordable.

BRING AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE AS A COURSE

Approximately 13% of United States residents are deaf or hard of hearing, yet at UC Davis we don’t offer the necessary tools to communicate with such a large community. I want to help Aggies stand out by bringing American Sign Language as a credited course to our campus. It should be offered as another language as well as count for credit to fulfill the B.A. requirement. I aim to make Davis one of less than 20 universities in California to offer such a useful, lifelong course. I want to help further diversify our campus and include all groups.

Be sure to VOTE KATIE SHERMAN #1 and NOW #26 for ASUCD SENATE on November 1215 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
