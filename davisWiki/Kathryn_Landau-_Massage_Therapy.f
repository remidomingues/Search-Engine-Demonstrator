20101021 04:41:55 nbsp Honestly, even though I consider Kate my friend, I must say that ~ very objectively ~ she gave me the best massage Ive ever had!!  Why?  Ill tell you, and Ive thought about it, definitely.  Its  because I could feel her harmonious energy, with its dynamic range:  both strong and gentle, both spontaneously musical and yet professionally structured, both caring and energetic, both vital and soothing!!
