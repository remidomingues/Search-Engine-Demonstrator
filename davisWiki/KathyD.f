Welcome to the wiki, KathyD!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080530 13:19:24 nbsp Hey, Kathy... you need to upload those photos as .jpg images, not bitmaps.  If you dont know how, Id be happy to convert them for you. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080616 19:14:13 nbsp Yes please!! Do I need to convert the photos somehow? Users/KathyD

20080616 19:34:47 nbsp Ok I converted the pics and uploaded them, I just would like some help moving them to the right upper corner if at all possible? it looks strange to have that empty space. Or maybe we could just center everything? Users/KathyD

20080616 19:52:03 nbsp Hey Kathy, I removed the images you uploaded to the hand & foot therapy page because they were basically just advertisement images  they werent images of the practice, nor were they images that you took (I imagine), so we dont likely have permission to use them (see copyrights on the wiki).  You should take a look at Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the welcome to the wiki (business owner) page if you havent already.  Hopefully it makes sense why we generally dont keep advertisementlike images around?  Users/PhilipNeustrom
