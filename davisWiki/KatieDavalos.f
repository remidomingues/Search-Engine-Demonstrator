About Me:
  Im very interested in activism and organizing; I enjoy different art forms, particularly photography, watercolor paint, and colored pencil drawing; I love all kinds of music and and always open to new experiences (and shows); I dont watch much television but can get sucked in very easilymy favorite things to watch are old war and scifi movies, whole television seasons on dvd, youtube videos, and anything my friends clue me into. I also love watching comicbook cartoons on dvd, like Justice League, Batman, Superman, and other DC Comics cartoons. Im pretty broke so I cant afford to go out much... i spend alot of time playing on the internet.

My favorite quote (for now):
To be stupid and selfish and to have good health are the three requirements for happiness, though if stupidity is lacking, the others are useless.
 Flaubert

20070307 22:14:02 nbsp No problem, I just split them and reverted the old page.  You might want to clean up the new page now. Users/DavidGrundler

20070307 22:29:57 nbsp No problem!  The irony here is that I am glad to help you out, even though I would not support your organization... Users/DavidGrundler

20070410 09:53:42 nbsp Ha.  I was somehow confusing 11:00 class with 11:00 walkout.  Thanks for the clarification. Users/DavidGrundler

20070410 11:31:01 nbsp Hey, Katie, I just wanted to say thank you for updating the May 1 entry.  Its much much more clear what it is, who it is, and the events that are planned.  I like your photos of Santa Cruz on the freewebs website.  Your DavisWiki account also works at http://santacruz.wikispot.org/ the Santa Cruz wiki as well.  Once again, thanks for stepping in and clearing up the May 1 event entry. Users/JabberWokky
