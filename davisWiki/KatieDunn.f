20110224 07:59:28 nbsp Which class asked you to create pages for things that dont exist on the wiki? Your http://daviswiki.org/Users/KatieDunn?actionuserinfo history shows that you added a link to volunteer opportunities that now goes to something that isnt a real volunteer opportunity. Could you get Users/ChristineEvans to answer the same question? Users/JasonAller

20110224 18:40:51 nbsp Hey Katie, I opened a discussion {{{ShadowFax Farms/Talk here}}} about how to handle the Shadowfax Farms entry (cool name, by the way!)  Im kind of mulling over other options, like possibly you using your user account, so it would be something like Users/KatieDunn/Shadowfax Farms, and/or adding a big disclaimer notice at the top.  Its a community discussion, and nobody is against you, were just trying to figure out if a project fits there, and if so, how to present it so it doesnt confuse people.   Welcome to the Wiki!
