 Candidate Statement for the Fall 2005 campaign 

Hi! My name is KATIE WEBBER and Im so excited to be running for Senate on the STUDENT FOCUS ticket. Im a first year and a double Communication and Comparative Literature major with a minor in Chinese. Although Ive only been here at Davis for a little over a month I already love it and want to be involved in making the campus and student life even better. I feel Im qualified to be on Senate because of the following activities and experiences: 

  ASB President of University High School 0405
  Student Liaison to City of Irvine City Council 
  Alpha Phi
  Junior Panhellenic Representative 

I feel that the main purposes of Senate should be to represent YOU, the student body of Davis. Some of the goals I would like to accomplish are:

  Unity through Diversity Bring together the entire campus by working with Aggie Pack, cultural organizations and Music Scene music groups to have more events on the quad.
  Generate more publicity for the great events that we already have by creating a ASUCD Publicity Committee.
  Bring a Undergraduate Business Major and Minor to Davis!
  Roll Over Pages Work to make the number of pages you can print in the computer labs carry over with each quarter. 

These are my personal goals as well as the goals of the rest of the STUDENT FOCUS slate! If you have any questions or ideas feel free to approach me on campus, after all my main focus is to represent the student body. Dont forget to vote November 1617 at http://elections.ucdavis.edu/ elections.ucdavis.edu for KATIE WEBBER and the rest of STUDENT FOCUS. Thanks!
