20110510 10:14:50 nbsp Hi Katy, welcome to the wiki!  I apologize if I offended you with my tongueincheek remark on the railroad fence page.  As I replied there, my point wasnt to be dismissive of anyone because of a disability or a lack of funds (believe me, I can relate there).  I was just trying to express, admittedly facetiously, that hopping over a fence probably isnt a very good idea, and it certainly isnt a good solution to this particular problem. Users/TomGarberson
