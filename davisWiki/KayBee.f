That was rather odd.  Perhaps Joe thought you were somebody else he knew with the same (or similar) name?  I think he intended it well, as its not exactly some kind of sinister thing to upload an incorrect but fairly normal picture for someone.  Im guessing he thought he knew you and uploaded a picture he thought was you just to be nice.  Strange.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
