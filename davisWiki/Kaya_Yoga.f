20080821 10:27:10 nbsp Ive been going to Kaya Yoga for a year now and my enjoyment has only increased.  Its improved my body awareness, my running, and its just fun.  While I enjoy Kia the most, the other instructors are great too. Users/smcc

20090303 16:48:27 nbsp I love this studio. The classes have a great flow. Kaya gives each student a lot of individual attention. I was recently in a car accident, and Kaya has given me a lot of guidance on how to modify poses and alleviate pain. I have never noticed a problem with the ventilation system. I love the design and feel of the studio. While the studio was crowded at the beginning of the year (New Years resolutions), it has since calmed down. I love all of the instructors. Users/JanethN.

20090411 08:40:48 nbsp I have been attending yoga here for a little over a year now, and I cannot say enough about this studio. It is fantastic! It is obvious that all of the instructors are highly trained and very knowledgeable. The classes have a wonderful flow and Im always learning! The Friday class with Mariah is my favorite!

20090527 17:26:20 nbsp Looooove Kia! Best yoga class in town. Actually its more like the best yoga class in the universe! No joke :) Users/love2dancewild
  Iâ€™d have to second that. Kia is amazing. Not only is she an exceptionally advanced teacher, shes personable, downtoearth, inspiring, and loving (or I should say, tough loving). Users/ZacharyNorwood Zach

20100206 13:22:14 nbsp Im new to yoga and tried several places before I found Kaya.  In addition to it being more affordable to some of the other studios, EVERY class was taught by knowledgeable instructors and I felt I got an excellent practice session.  THe instructors are all very helpful and are willing to talk with you about your personal concerns before and after class.  As a middle aged female athlete, I come with a host of old injuries.  I always felt that the instructor really cared about my health and safety.
As an interesting aside, I did the ten day trial at Bikram.  While there were aspects of that place that I liked, during that entire time not a single instructor ever mentioned to me that my knees tend to hyperextend.  In fact, I was pushed to straighten my knee during some poses, even though I felt unstable doing so.  Within the first WEEK at Kayla, THREE instructors mentioned that they noticed my knees tended to hyperextend, and they warned me not to straighten it completely. Suddenly the instability I experienced made sense!
The ONLY negative I can think of about Kaya is that a few of the classes seem to be attended mostly by college students.  I felt a LITTLE out of place in those although the instructor did everything she could to make me feel comfortable and help me not to feel pressured to do what those young limber bodies were doing.  However, I want to stress that this was more MY problem than one with the studio.  (One of the challenges of yoga is NOT to focus on things like thatclearly I need to work on this.)
Kia, Bahvana, you ROCK!!! Users/toriac
