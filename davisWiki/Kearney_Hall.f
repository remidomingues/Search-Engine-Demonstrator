Kearney Hall is one of the two fourstory residence hall buildings that make up Tercero South Residence Halls. Most of its spacious rooms are shared by three residents. All of the rooms have airconditioning, and require a card/key to unlock. The third floor is the engineering floor and fourth floor is the Womens floor.

Construction was completed in 2005. It was known as Building 1 until 2006, when it was named for Patricia Kearney, the former executive director of undergraduate housing.  Should the building ever be fortified against Zombie Attack Response Guide zombie attack, it will be renamed again to wiki:wikipedia:Fort Kearny Fort wiki:wikipedia:Fort Phil Kearny Kearney.
