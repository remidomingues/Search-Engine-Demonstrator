Keep Davis Boring is a concerned group of Davis citizens with the goal of keeping Davis, Davis!  We love Davis and would hate to see our unique blend of liberal civic values compromised by those concurrent with the growing transient population.  Our organization came about in the leadup to the Fall elections of 2006.  With the huge controversy surrounding Measures K few people noticed the more subtle but exceedingly virulent Measure F, which threatened to loosen restrictions that protect our quality of life and destroy everything Davis has stood for since much of the community purchased houses here in the earlymid 1980s.

Our platform is as follows:

 Keep Davis Boring” is against bigbox incursion into our small businessfriendly community.  Davis needs to preserve our local boutiques.  The local art scene is supported by our wealth of craft and bead stores that can satisfy the needs of any scrapbooker.

 Keep Davis Boring is against undesirable development in Davis.  Our smalltown charm is under siege from developers and temporary residents demanding unsustainable low rents.  High rents keep our property values high, and property owners support local business and community vitality.

 Keep Davis Boring is for protecting our diverse local businesses from outside competition.

 Keep Davis Boring is against unreasonable neighborhood disturbances.  Davis’ diverse community of property and business owners, professors, researchers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen and women, hobbyists and homemakers, came to Davis to realize a dream of a quiet family environment.  That dream is threatened by unconscionably disruptive behaviors like parties, loud music, skateboarding, and public drunkenness.

 Keep Davis Boring believes that Davis is not a college town.  We are a diverse familyoriented community of likeminded individuals.  We recognize the negative fiscal impact of the transient student population.  Students living on campus are already prevented from voting in local elections.  Keep Davis Boring supports future measures to bar all registered UC Davis students from participating in local politics, of which they are ignorant.

 Keep Davis Boring is against Davis becoming another Woodland.  Big box stores, cheap eating establishments, and poorly maintained housing cater to unmotivated, uneducated populations.

 Keep Davis Boring is for preserving the character of downtown Davis.  We must protect the privilege enjoyed by established residents to walk to work at our local law, real estate, psychiatric, and corporate offices.

 Keep Davis Boring supports law enforcement.  The Davis community must collaborate with law enforcement interests to levy higher fines on miscreants who threaten our peace and privacy.  Keep Davis Boring supports noise regulations like Davis Municipal Code/24.01.030 Chapter 24.01.030 that facilitate enforcement with the threat of imprisonment.

 Keep Davis Boring supports substantial subsidization of exclusive events that meet community standards.  Events must be safe and reassuring for the whole family, from pony rides at the Farmer’s Market to our phenomenally successful Davis Fest.  No matter what the occasion, reasonable people deserve familiar music that we have heard before.

 Keep Davis Boring is against any events (political gettogethers, concerts, parties, readings, religious gatherings, “jam sessions”) that may exceed our cherished noise protections.

 Keep Davis Boring supports cultural and musical diversity in Davis.  However, black musicians should only be allowed to play the blues or jazz, preferably instrumentals.

 Keep Davis Boring categorically refuses to revisit the question of a “European” open container policy in the city of Davis.

 Keep Davis Boring wants our children inside and safe after dark.  Our increasingly crimeridden streets (60% rate increase in the past two months) prove that FUN doesn’t work for our community.  Keep Davis Boring is against trickortreating after 5 p.m.  Happily, Davis has affirmed this position—mission already achieved.

 Keep Davis Boring supports businesses that keep reasonable business hours that reflect community values, like spending evenings with our children.  Businesses that stay open eight, ten, EVEN twentytwo hours, foster subversive communication and behavior.

 Keep Davis Boring supports maintaining our quality of life.  Keep Davis Boring is working with public transit to establish a shuttle to transport lessfortunate individuals to more appropriate socioeconomic surroundings and opportunities, like factory and agricultural work, and the military.

 Keep Davis Boring is against the homogenizing effects of the cultural hegemony of the Bush administration.  Keep Davis Boring supports our progressive values and our right to maintain our community standards in the face of encroaching threats from the libertarian fringe.

Some community members have voiced indignation over our organization name and slogan.  Keep Davis Boring! may seem divisive, we all are aware of the complaints made by transients about the lack of entertainment venues, budget food options, and socalled fair housing.  In our opposition to Measure F (offensively dubbed Measure Fun by its transient supporters) we realized what made Davis great our quiet, communityoriented, localbusinessfriendly values  and said Hey!  Davis is kinda boring.  Thats the way we like it!  So were turning it around...

20080511 17:52:49 nbsp This is either seriously funny or funny because its serious. Users/JamesSchwab
    Check out wiki:wikipedia:Poes law!

20080511 18:06:56 nbsp Our organization is very serious!  Although our profile has been low the past few years (raising a family sure is time consuming!) look for us tabling at the Farmers Market this summer where well be distributing information packets and FREE STICKERS!! Users/SuzieMiller

20080511 18:14:45 nbsp But see, Davis IS a college town. You cant deny that. Without the university, this town would not exist, unlike other cities where a university is built long after the city is developed. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080511 18:30:12 nbsp Oh Brandon, of course we know that!  Keep Davis Boring members are all former students and we realize the immense opportunities created for local business and property managers by Davis evergrowing student population.  Thats why were looking to sponsor legislation that will solve our housing demand crisis by requiring graduates of UC Davis to either buy property/rent downtown retail space or vacate the city within one year of graduation! Users/SuzieMiller

20080511 18:34:50 nbsp Against Davis becoming another Woodland: I dont think we need to worry about Davis becoming uneducated as long as UC Davis is around. And the educated residents of Woodland might find this statement insulting. I personally am against Davis becoming elitist.  Users/ElleWeber

20080511 18:45:22 nbsp  To remark on However, black musicians should only be allowed to play the blues or jazz, preferably instrumentals.
That is what is called racism. I cant believe that this family oriented group would be supporting such racist remarks. Also the against any events (political gettogethers, concerts, parties, readings, religious gatherings, “jam sessions”) that may exceed our cherished noise protections. I dont think of Davis as a particularly loud town. The only loud noise I hear is the high schoolers downtown. Users/BrandonBarrette


20080511 18:46:23 nbsp Youre right Elle.  Sue Geenwald commented on DCTV last year that Davis and Woodland have a healthy relationship.  I believe she said that Woodland citizens come to Davis to enjoy our upscale restaurants and movie theaters or work in various janitorial labor for the University whereas Davis residents can go to Woodland to enjoy budget shopping options like Target and Wal Mart that Davis simply isnt equipped to include. Users/SuzieMiller

20080511 19:07:59 nbsp I wonder how long till this page gets deleted.  Aside from chaos, it doesnt really add to or benefit the Davis Wiki community.

But in other news, this looks a lot like the work of Brendan (of KDVS)...but maybe its just cause he is responsible for when I first heard about this back in 2006... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080511 19:11:16 nbsp Hey, Im up for it staying here IF they remove the racist remarks and tone down the bolding. Not even the Target Debate page has that much bolding. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080511 19:22:07 nbsp Agreed.  Im Indian and Portuguese.  I wonder what music Id be allowed to play.  Will I have to turn in my guitar for a sitar?  Maybe close my bookstore before we hit the eight hour mark.  Who knows what subversive literature those visiting janitors could be reading?  I guess its back to spending my Friday nights listening to my fine collection of Muzak as I sip tepidly on roomtemperature water. Im not thirsty...I just like the taste... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080511 19:25:37 nbsp Haha, I couldnt believe that remark either that Woodland residents only work as Janitors in Davis. I have really considered leaving Davis once in candidacy because it is so dang expensive to live here. Not only for rent, but groceries and entertainment. Nonetheless, after thinking about this page, I realized it is really just a hypocrisy and I should just laugh and move on, but stop back frequently for casual laughs. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080511 19:41:48 nbsp You guys have been trolled so hard. Users/WilliamLewis

20080511 19:49:06 nbsp Image(successful.jpg) Users/BrentLaabs

20080511 19:59:08 nbsp If this is meant to be a joke, it is not well done, because I know people like this, sadly. Nonetheless, remove the page if it isnt real. Its irrelevant to Davis and just plain dumb. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080511 20:44:17 nbsp I CONCUR WHOLEHEARTEDLY

BORING DAVIS WINS Users/StevenDaubert

20080511 20:58:46 nbsp Im 99% sure that this is indeed some species of troll.  However, if it isnt, most of the items cited in the keep Davis boring platform would get thrown out in court in any case, as they would violate the Constitution... Users/IDoNotExist

20080511 21:04:42 nbsp I like the idea of keeping Davis boring (sans all the elitism, racism, pretentiousness and fascism expressed on this pagesee Keep Davis Boring supports noise regulations like Chapter 24.01.030 that facilitate enforcement with the threat of imprisonment, et al).  Imprisonment?  Really?  Yea, I might be for that if there was no real, serious crimes being committed.  I think that Davis PD should be using their limited resources on catching real criminals (as opposed to writing chickenS tickets). I want Davis boring, too, but I dont agree with most of the stuff on this page, somehow.  Dont forget, Davis IS a university town.  The University is what put Davis on the map.  I like being able to walk around with a beverage and I dont consider businesses that close too early as having reasonable business hours.  On a positive note, I like the antibigbox sentiment.  And Im not one of these socalled, transients.  Im huge Davisite and I still feel this way.

And can someone please tell me why I am offended over the black musicians comment?  Im not uptight, but nobody is going to take this group or mission seriously if S like that is  supported.  And the family crap could be toned down a little, too. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080511 21:23:58 nbsp This isnt a trolling; this is a lampooning.  Pretty well done, too, I think. Users/CovertProfessor

20080511 21:39:37 nbsp So is there some rule that says that businesses in Davis must close by 9ish?  This doesnt occur consistently, but there arent that many restaurants open after 9, and there are almost none open after 10... Users/IDoNotExist

20080511 21:54:48 nbsp The civic code that punishes noise violations with imprisonment is legit.  Noise violations are a misdemeanor (normally youre not supposed to go to jail for it), but recently many cities around the country have enstated a three strikes policy.  Two years ago I got two noise tickets in one night.  The cops said if they came back again Id go to jail.  fucked up.

Unconstitutional?  A couple years ago the university banned Hip Hop and Punk music from campus.  That sounds a bit racist to me. Users/AndyPastalaniec

20080511 22:13:48 nbsp This is not a joke. Its clearly satirical. I also believe this page shouldnt be deleted since Ive seen this stickers around Davis so it actually does have relevance.  Users/JeremyOgul
                                 Lets hope so. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080511 22:26:20 nbsp So is it legit to publish racist comments on Davis Wiki.. because it seems that way (in regards to this page). I realize this page is rather fake; as the author made this page today, made their profile today, and uploaded a fake pic on their profile. Nonetheless, its about keeping the integrity of Davis Wiki... Users/BrandonBarrette
 Why is are so many people hypersensitive over racism, especially in satire? Keeping it wont harm the integrity of the wiki at all. Its not like this page paints us all as racists or racist sympathizers. In fact, this page makes fun of racists in a way. Users/WilliamLewis

   Just because you think its funny doesnt mean other people wont be offended. It is ridiculous that the wiki has come to this. And this is nothing like Keep Austin Weird. This steps the boundary because the satire is so true in this case that it could be mistaken as the truth. See Poes Law above after the first comment. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080511 22:31:02 nbsp Wow, I didnt know about the Austin thing...thanks!  Yay indy bookstores! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080511 22:40:27 nbsp I dont feel right about this page being deleted. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080511 22:57:57 nbsp The Keep Davis Boring symbol of approval can be spotted at businesses and Davis landmarks we support!

I saw a KDB sticker on a Don Saylor sign.  Does that mean that KDB endorses and supports Don Saylor? Users/GregWebb

20080512 00:58:18 nbsp As a former resident of Austin I find this hilarious.  I want my free sticker! Users/WilliamBeamish

20080512 13:51:33 nbsp Suzie Miller, you are my Ron Paul. Users/RobRoy

20080512 14:34:47 nbsp Why would anyone delete the best page on the Wiki? Its not like the Wiki has any integrity anyway. And as a Mexican, I say keep this goddamn page, crackers.  Users/JoshFernandez

20080512 15:20:38 nbsp Keep Davis Boring and I share a birthday, ergo it should remain...I wonder who they are endorsing for council? Users/AndrewPeake

20080519 17:38:35 nbsp Not a college town?  If half the population were fisherman, would it not be a fishing town?  If half the population were coal miners, would it not be a mining town?  Does it not work the same way with students? Users/CodyDuncan
   Nope, remember that KDB maintains that students only count as 3/5ths of a person. (See the final paragraph? Transients refers to students).
    Doesnt that make Davis a Transienttown then? Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  Whats KDS?  Users/BrandonBarrette  (I meant KDB and fixed it.  Its bad satire when you mistype.)

20080522 09:13:41 nbsp I just noticed the graffiti art between the art building and theatre on campus was completely painted over with one solid bland color and above this was a Keep Davis Boring Sticker. Does KDB do the graff removal? this would seem to fit within the scope of their mission... Users/PxlAted

20080618 09:42:39 nbsp My neighbors kids started playing basketball in the front yard at 7am in the morning today!!!  Unlike when college kids have parties past 10pm, kids are allowed to make noise in the early morning with impunity.  Fuck you keep davis boring!! Users/AndyPastalaniec

20080620 23:01:31 nbsp The Bumperstickers bumper sticker Keep Davis Boring was mentioned in public comment on Thursday June 19th at a Planning Commission meeting. I dont know if the speaker understood that the phrase is somewhat of a sarcastic statement but her argument was that Davis should not be boring by building a 400 acre senior housing community at the Covell Village farm on Poleline and Covell. What do you think of that Suzie Miller? Users/RobRoy

20080709 22:38:04 nbsp a nice gradual breakdown. Users/CodyDuncan

20080729 11:45:36 nbsp Davis: 14 square miles surrounded by reality. Users/AndyPastalaniec

20080729 14:50:16 nbsp The police have been called two or three times from some anonymous neighbor about my parents dog barking.  It would be one thing if it was the middle of the night, but they tend to show up promptly at 10:05 pm, right after the noise ordinance goes into effect.  Even the police officer acknowledged that it was a stupid complaint...   Users/MaryLieth

20100122 15:22:34 nbsp Im so glad you guys helped shut down the Davis Bike Church. They were a nuisance to the neighborhood, attracting child molesters and nonenglish speaking people of color with their impractical Utopic vision of bike repair for all. They were definitely a threat to our wellestablished local bike stores, too, and were draining cash out of the local economy. Worst of all, they were not boring at least, they didnt think they were. I went by there a couple of times and the people looked pretty boring to me. But not in a good way.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! Users/TyNowotny
