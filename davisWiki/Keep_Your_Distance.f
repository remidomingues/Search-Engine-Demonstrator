Keep Your Distance (KYD) was a Davisbased hardcore Music Scene band that played a healthy mix of more traditional style hardcore with breakdowns the size of steamrollers.

KYD was a band from October 2002 to May of 2005, briefly reuniting in January of 2006 for one show.  The original lineup featured Eric Beane on drums, Users/DonovanKelley Don Kelley on guitar/vocals, Users/GregorySmith Gregory Smith on bass, and some stoner named Matt pretending to learn power chords while secretly yearning to play Clapton solos.  Matt was quickly ousted and Users/HaggroAlex Alex (the haggro one) joined the band to play guitar.  Realizing that Alex could actually play, Don would often put away his guitar and ruin his vocal cords fulltime.

The first real lineup:

Don  Vocals/Guitar
Alex  Guitar
Greg  Bass
Eric  Drums

KYD played a number of shows in this configuration.  Highlights include:

 their very first show, where a drunken KYD played a renegade set at some drama department party with instruments borrowed from a silly indie band
 their first planned show in Kleiber Hall Kleiber Hall (courtesy of Davis Music Scene DMS), a week after the drama party, where Greg and Don totalled more bad jokes told than songs played
 a couple shows at West Coast Worldwide (WCWW), where Greg was heckled by the crowd for use of the word mosh
 a renegade set without Don (and therefore vocals) at Cafe Roma Cafe Roma on Picnic Day Picnic Day (2003, if memory serves)
 other assorted shows at the Loyola House Loyola House and the Coffee House CoHo

One or two demos were recorded with the original lineup and the concensus is that they sound like poop, but discoveries were made.  While recording the Time To Strike EP, the band took a liking to Gregs backup vocals (which, according to the other members, were very Britishsounding).  No changes were made immediately, but the seeds of metamorphosis (thanks, thesaurus.com) had been sown.  Don eventually got tired of doing vocals, wanting to refocus he efforts on playing guitar, so Greg traded in his bass for a microphone and JeffMacDonald Jeff MacDonald joined the band.

The official lineup:

Don  Guitar
Alex  Guitar
Jeff  Bass
Greg  Vocals
Eric  Drums

KYD would take this lineup to its grave in 2005, but not before playing a multitude of ridiculous breakdowns and stupid cover songs across Davis.  Show highlights include:

 a Very Flintstones Hardcore Halloween at the Loyola House Loyola House
 one of the first hardcore shows at The Graduate the Grad
 two of the biggest Davis Music Scene DMS shows ever at the Coffee House CoffeeHouse
 one of the few shows put on at 2500 Loyola 2500 Loyola
 the only show ever played in KYDs practice space at the Lefant House Lefant House, their last show before breaking up.
