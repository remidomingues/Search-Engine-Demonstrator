Hello.

I am Keith Bradnam.

That is not much of a description I suppose. You can find out more about me on my website http://keithbradnam.com. I also have a blog (http://blog.keithbradnam.com) and its not uncommon for me to blog about aspects of life in Davis. If you want a quick 3 point precis of me, here goes:

1) I really like Marmite
2) I buy too many CDs....or rather I dont spend enough time listening to all the music I buy
3) I like living in Davis...really like it.

My only major contribution to the Davis Wiki thus far has been to overhaul the page on Twitter.
Toodle pip.

Keith

I think theres something of a gap in that most people who use the wiki use the messaging system here instead of Twitter.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

Nice blog. However, what do you have against chaos, anyway? Some people in this town Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion worship American Brontosaurus Cabal of Davis Eristopia it, so watch your back! Users/WilliamLewis

20110810 11:33:05 nbsp Hey Keith, just so you know, theres really no distinction between the main article and the comment section.  The comment bar is basically a tool for convenience for people who arent comfortable enough with editing to make changes directly.  The entire page is the entry, though.  Quite a few people want to get rid of the comment bar entirely because of the false perception that it somehow distinguishes between content above and below the bar.  See cut that comment bar out.  You might want to check out the Neutral Point of View page, as well  the gist of it is that the Wiki doesnt try to keep a neutral point of view on entries, or separate between a fact portion above the comment bar and an opinion portion below; rather, it tries to incorporate many different points of view.
