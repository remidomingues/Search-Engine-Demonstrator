20070410 08:51:02 nbsp Dr. Grote is very nice and his hygienists are extremely friendly and skilled (I never leave with polish/paste all over my face like I did at Davis Fam. Dentistry!).  I have gone to this office since elementary school, but now my UCD employee insurance doesnt cover him :(   Get an appointment here if at all possible!  The only problem is hes so popular that appointments are full months in advance....  Users/SarahThrasher

20090617 21:36:54 nbsp I had a very good experience at Dr. Grotes. The scheduling staff was very flexible and polite when I had to make a last minute change. When I showed up Dr. Grote was up front in a chair talking with his staff which was refreshing as some clinics have a wall of separation there. I was seen immediately and visited by the doctor who was professional and friendly and had one quality Ive never seen in a dentist  positivity. Also, no cavities. Recommended.  Users/sjoe

20090831 13:16:07 nbsp Dr Grotes prices are high and you rarely see him.  His staff does most of the work Users/Wildwings

20110815 16:29:58 nbsp Ive had nothing but excellent experiences at Dr. Grotes office. Its by far the best dentists office Ive ever visited. The staff are very friendly and professional, and highly knowledgable. Hes also a super nice guy, and clearly puts the quality of the patient experience as top on his list of priorities.

20120104 01:11:32 nbsp I have to say that this was the best dentist experience Ive ever had. I knew it would be so from the moment I sat down in Grotes office and he said, I just think its best to get to know my patients before sticking a bunch of dentist tools down their throats. The staff takes the time to get to know who you are and talk to you like youre a human being. Theyre very patient and I never once felt like I was being guilt tripped about how I took care of my teeth.

That said, note that Grotes office is NOT PPO. That means that if you have UC Davis Ship insurance, you will only be covered 60%, not 90% as under PPOapproved dentists. This explains the high prices.  Users/lunelectronique
