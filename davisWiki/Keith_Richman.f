Keith Richman has been playing the guitar for 30 years & Music Instruction teaching it to others for about 20. He has forged a unique style of playing that builds on the tradition of such players as Blind Blake, Big Bill Broonzey, Robert Johnson and Reverend Gary Davis.  Keith is a proponent of the theory that the best blues come from the boogie woogie and barrel house blues pieces adapted from piano.

Keith is available for casuals & instruction.
