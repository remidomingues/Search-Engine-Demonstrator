Keith Shively is an ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senator (Elected Fall 2004), and the first one in recorded history to be elected as a conservative. Conservative senators (notably Christopher Goren) have been elected in the past, but theyve always kept their political beliefs on the downlow until elected.  Some, like former ASUCD President Sara Henry remain in the closet until their farewell speech.  Others, like Goren, whup out their throbbing conservatism as as soon as they are in the Senate and proceed to thrust it proudly about.

Aside from marketing himself as a conservative, Keith had another campaign trick up his sleeve which has been declared by many observers to have been the best $14 ever spent on an ASUCD campaign  He took out an advertisement on Facebook.

Part of the secret to his success may have been his consultant, George Andrews, who in the past has worked on large campaigns in the real world, such as Michael Dugas campaign for Congress in 2004.  Keiths campaign was also spearheaded by extensive getoutthevote efforts on the part of the Davis College Republicans (DCR).

Keith has a http://www.keith4senate.com/ website for his senate campaign.

He is also a member of Alpha Gamma Omega (AGO), a ChristCentered Fraternity.

The California Aggie approves of Keiths http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/02/10/Opinion/Editorial.Thought.The.Fire.Engine.Was.A.Waste1319537.shtml performance as a Senator.



  From what I can tell, hes a nice guy.  Not everyone dresses up for senate meetings, tie and all, just what they consider to be important or formal occasions.  Hes left a good impression on me so far, lets hope we continue to see lots of good things from him.  Users/MarieHuynh
  Yay for Keith! He came to GASC ! He is willing to learn and work with everyone, I like it when he smiles too.  Users/JenndelaVega
  Keith seems like a nice person, albeit, perhaps a klutzy one. Last year I lived in Tercero as did Keith, and EVERY time  saw him he had some sort of cast on, or other injuryrelated item. Crutches, casts, ace bandages, you name it! Would love to hear the story behind those...  Users/AbbyLawson
      He was a baseball player, played for UCD.  He tore his rotator cuff a bit before he ran for Senate and needed surgery on that.  Its a pretty common baseball injury (especially for pitchers).
  Keith is now officially the Voice of Reason in the Senate, given whats going on in ASUCD Open Government this thread.  This job belonged to Adam Barr before his resignation, and hopefully Keith will continue his dissent.  Of course, if nothing much changes, it means he will be the sole dissenter just like Adam was.
