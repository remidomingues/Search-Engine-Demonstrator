Keith the dogs Dog lives with Users/MikeyBurke at Empty House.  Keith has learned, under extensive training, how to high five.  He has also learned how to talkFootnote(So far he can only say hello).  I think, under these circumstances, Keith should have more rights than most babies (some of them dont even know how to high five, and most of them dont know how to talk).  So please, allow Keith to enter your store, house, or restaurant.  He certainly doesnt like sitting in the car unless it is moving.

Dear Keith is a mix of African Basenji and Queensland Heeler.  His ears perk up, making him look like a coyote. He has a number of hobbies: wrestling with Brett Hart, Users/RishiTrivedi and Users/MikeyBurke, making out with Users/BudCutino and stealing the food of Users/GonzaloEyzaguirre and Users/JenndelaVega.





Keith is able to stand on his hind legs for very long periods of time.
