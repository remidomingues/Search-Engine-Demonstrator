Welcome to the Wiki, Kelly!  I think you probably meant to put most of this information on the Loves Dry Carpet Cleaning page.  This is your user page, and will be pretty hard for people to find.  You already created the business pagenow you just need to fill in the template!  Before you do, though, please take a moment to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner welcome page and the Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions For Profit Restrictions.  Because of its agreement with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the wiki cant be used to promote businesses directly.  Business pages need to be informational, rather than promotional, and theyre normally from the communitys perspective.  See the business owner welcome page I linked for more info.
