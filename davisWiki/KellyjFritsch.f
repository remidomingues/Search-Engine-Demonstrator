20101007 10:38:05 nbsp One of the awesome things about new users on the wiki who are longtime Davis residents is the wealth of knowledge they bring.  The history of the kids stores in town will be a wonderful addition to the pages.  If you want, you can also add info on openings and closings to the Davis Timeline (go into the relevant decade, then the individual year, rather than putting it on the Major Milestones list).  Welcome to the Wiki, and thanks for contributing! Users/TomGarberson
