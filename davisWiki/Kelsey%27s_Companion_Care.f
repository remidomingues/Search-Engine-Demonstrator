20130216 10:32:55 nbsp Kelsey played a big part in relieving any stress I felt about leaving my puppy with her for doggie day care service. She asks questions upon initiation of service that show she considers your needs and your pets safety and well being. Her prices are reasonable and she is very open to your instructions about care. It has all been super personalized so far and I love the benefit of pick up/drop off service. I would use her again! Users/lucianatalie

20130924 08:33:40 nbsp Kelsey provides an absolutely reliable and trustworthy pet and house sitting service that has allowed us to travel with the knowledge that our home and beloved cats and dog are receiving excellent care.  Also, she does it with a cheerful and nonjudgemental demeanor that makes us (almost) unselfconscious about our rather quirky house and perhaps even quirkier animals!  Surprisingly, that quality is not one possessed by all professional pet sitters, as we discovered years ago before we were lucky enough to find PetPals, the service for whom Kelsey worked before its wonderful owners moved on to other endeavors and transferred a large portion of their business to Kelsey. Through the years we had employed a sometimes frustratingly colorful cast of professional pet sitters, some of whom we felt we were working around, rather than working with.  Still, we felt it preferable to taking our pets to kennels, whichthe once or twice we did itthey so clearly found frightening.  PetPals ended all of that stress, for our animals and for us, and Kelsey has maintained and continued to fine tune the high quality service originated by her former employers.  We dont hesitate to recommend Kelsey to anybody seeking reassurance that their home and pets are respectfully, reliably and lovingly cared for in their absence. Users/CandaceHanson

I cant thank Kelsey enough for the peace of mind that brings.   Users/GrantLowther
