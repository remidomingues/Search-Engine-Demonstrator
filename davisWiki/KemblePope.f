Im not sure where you get the idea that curse words are okay for adults. Outside of 17 to 24 year olds, if somebody is using curse words in normal conversation (i.e., not having just been dumped, sued, drunk off their ass, etc), they are simply uncouth, and it tends to be an indicator of other, less savory aspects of their personality or simply poor manners. I like the way NPR handles it (note that NPR, not being commercial, could use any words they like onair): they do not allow swearing in their stories unless they are newsworthy quotes, and then they prefer not to censor anything, playing the sound clip or reading the quote directly. Thus, they were the only source for the whole Tyson Im gonna f you in the ass, you fing n clip. That format would make sense for the wiki.

Personally, I avoid people who swear casually in public. I also avoid people who slap me on the arm, who belch loudly after eating in a nice restaurant, who pick their teeth in public with their thumbnail, who pick their nose in public... i.e., people who dont know how to behave in a civilized manner. That said, I like art (poetry, movies and books) that use all those things, as they are being used to convey aspects of society or desperation that arent civilized. Theres no contradiction; I like reading Exquisite Corpse, but I dont want to hang around serial killers who rape and eat dead bodies. During a performance of Rocky Horror, I yell more curse words than some people hear in a lifetime and make horribly raunchy jokes. But when the show ends, and the cast goes to a diner, I am with friends rather than characters and I dont swear at all.

Fundamentally, it is an issue of time and place. An entry in the wiki about bad service in a restaurant shouldnt have cursing, IMO. If a Mayor Pro Tem made a comment in public about The fing bad job the police are doing, I think it should be quoted word for word, no censorship. The Wiki isnt a work of art; it is a work of reference. — JabberWokky Users/KemblePope

20100212 12:50:20 nbsp Hey, I noticed your edit comment quick fix to comply with new template. Keep in mind that templates are suggestions and collections of good ideas, not a standard that entries have to comply to.  They help make entries more useful by presenting the information in an easy to grasp and flexible layout, and are not a requirement that forces everything to slavishly follow a fixed format.  If there were fixed fields and records, it would be much easier to simply do everything in a database.  A wiki gives freedom to craft each entry in whatever way works best for the subject at hand.  Templates are great tools, but they arent mandates... they are merely one good idea for a layout. Users/JabberWokky

20100212 14:21:10 nbsp Hey, if you really like em use em.  I just dont want you to feel constrained by them.  Sometimes people see repeated examples and think okay, this is how it is done.  Pretty much anything common on the wiki is only common because somebody early on just started doing it that way.  Its easy to see it as fluid when you watched it all appear from nothing, and its easy to fall into a trap of this is the one true way to do this when you see it done that way over and over on the wiki.  I only mention it to you because you took such an interest in the templates and reworking layouts. Users/JabberWokky

20100524 18:29:32 nbsp To all of my fellow Wiki Editors  If youd like to change the content of this page that describes my love affair with Davis, how about leaving a comment or emailing me first?  I write for a living, so Id prefer that this page reflects my style.  Each word has been chosen carefully e.g. subscribes is better than consumes because I want to subtly point out that all three of these wonderful services actually deliver to my door and send me an invoice.

20111014 14:08:12 nbsp Regarding the Anderson Courts page, awwwful lot of editorializing going on in there too. parklike setting...fantastic location...HUGE walkin closets. It really reads like a commercial, not to mention the part down at the bottom that does, in fact, list prices. Users/JoePomidor
   Editorializing is good.  It also goes on about the noise level and how it probably isnt for people who dont want young kids running around.  Id ding some of the bulleted points for not having any sort of supporting statements (and also for all caps, which is just plain bad writing).  Huge walk in closets without any explanation is one thing.  The closets are so huge that local band Madeup managed to actually play in one for a birthday party in a unit in 2011 is another kind of statement, which is far superior.  Even a the closets, at 20 feet by 50 feet, are some of the most staggering, gobstruck awesomely huge closets you will ever find in town statement would be fine.  In fact, that wording, if true, would also be freaking cool.  Editorializing and commercial motive are two different things.  Sometimes the community of Davis does enthusiastically Farmers Market laud places or bicycling activities.  jw
     I lived at Anderson which is why the page http://daviswiki.org/Anderson_Place_Apartments/Comment_Archive stuck out funny, especially the photos.  I could go on for pages about it in great detail, which might actually delight JW!   Anyway, looking over the Anderson Place Apartments/Reviews from 2006 and the current comments, I actually feel there should be much more of a negative slant to the page.  But thats not what led me to put advert on the page.  users/edwins ES

20120514 07:23:08 nbsp You can create an entry for ChamberPAC by clicking on that underlined word.  If theres enough information to stand alone, it should probably have a distinct entry. Users/JabberWokky

20120514 10:33:08 nbsp How is it not a conflict of interest that you helped in Souzas 2008 campaign?  Also, what do you think the purpose of the municipal ordinance to limit campaign contributions is? What makes it ethically okay for your PAC to override the intent of that law? I find it disappointing when I see the Yost contribution of $1000. Are we in the community really supposed to believe that Yost is contributing that much primarily for Measure D, since a normal interpretation of the law should limit their contribution to $100 for candidate support? This has nothing to do with people like Souza trying to fasttrack the water project, right? If its not a good old boys club, then please tell us the voting results of the PAC members in their decision of who to support for candidacy. Did all 5 PAC members unanimously decide on the same 3 candidates, or was there any dissent, as one would generally expect in such decisions? Also, what is Alyce LLC, and why is there almost no information of them online, and yet they donated $1000. Is this mysterious Alyce LLC as much in love with public parks as Yost clearly is? Users/ScottMeehleib

 Conflict of interest? We live in a small town. If you are the least bit involved in this community, then you will immediately have multiple connections/relationships across town. The presence of a conflict of interest is independent from the execution of impropriety (wikipedia). So, youll just have to take me at my word that I gave all of the candidates a fair hearing.

 The Davis ChamberPAC is following, and has always followed Davis Municipal Code 12.01.035. Please note that any amount over $100 donated by an individual or business will not be used for a council candidate independent expenditure in this election cycle. The remainder of that amount will be spent in support of Measure D and building the organizations infrastructure (i.e. website). You dont even have to suspend belief very long to confirm this statement, we are voluntarily releasing Financial Disclosures for money raised and money spent every Friday until the election and then according to state and local regulations.

 Your good ol boys club includes a woman, but everyone seems to ignore that Janis Lott is an active member of the Davis ChamberPAC Board. There was hours of discussion, dissent and arguing. We came to consensus on Frerichs, Wolk & Souza for a variety of reasons that have been stated over and over again.

 Allyce LLC  Owned by a friend of one of the Board members who is interested in promoting a more rational public policy discourse in our community, but he has no stomach for the type of innuendos and mud slinging that you seem so comfortable with. I dont even remember the owners names or what they do; weve never heard from them except for their donation to support a more sustainable local economy. I couldnt comment on their level or mystery or amount of love for public parks.

20120514 11:09:18 nbsp You asked me why I deleted the PACs reasoning for picking its candidates. That is a fair question. Looking back, there were a few things that I should have kept. The fact of the matter is that its much easier for all the other editors if you make small incremental edits instead of one giant edit that both adds and deletes a bunch of substantial content in one shot. Since I disagreed with a lot of your massive changes to the page, I was forced to go back and cherrypick the parts that seemed worthy of inclusion. Inevitably, I missed some of the reasonable info and opinions you originally supplied simply because there was so much to wade through. You gave a couple concrete reasons for why the candidates were chosen, but they were given in the midst of a lot of generic political ideals that could be applied to literally ANY of the candidates, including the ones your PAC doesnt support. If you truly strive to be transparent, I recommend giving more concrete reasoning. I also recommend moving away from generic banalities that read like propaganda, because they will only fuel further suspicion and probably continue to be reverted by myself and/or other editors as selfpromoting (advertisey) fluff. Users/ScottMeehleib

 Unfortunately, you are wrong about the generic political ideals that could be applied to literally ANY of the candidates... that just aint so. Recommend all you like.

20120514 19:41:21 nbsp Are you behind the account Users/DavisChamberPAC? If not, who is? Have they acted under your direction? Users/WilliamLewis

   One of my staff members created the user account DavisChamberPAC after I asked her to create a page on the DavisWiki about our efforts and to closely follow the editing guidelines of the DavisWiki. Upon realizing that she created this organizational handle, I asked her to delete it and to start posting under her own name... which she is now doing.
    Did you or she not see the discussion on Davis ChamberPAC/Talk this page, which was underway when she came along and created the PAC page?  It is not following the editing guidelines of the DW to ignore discussion whether action X should be taken, and instead, go ahead and take action X unilaterally.  If youre wondering why so many people were ticked off, that was one of the reasons.   Users/CovertProfessor



So Kemble Pope supports Steve Souza? Have I got that right? Users/GeorgeSantayana
    Yes. Users/DonShor
    No, DonShor. The Davis ChamberPAC supports Yes on Measure D, Lucas Frerichs, Dan Wolk & Stephen Souza. I, as an individual, support Yes on Measure D monetarily and with my endorsement. I have neither endorsed nor donated to any of the candidates campaigns. My contract with the Davis Chamber of Commerce precludes me from participating in City Council elections outside of ChamberPAC work. So, my vote is secret. However, I dont think its a secret to anyone that Ive long been an http://www.davisvoice.com/2008/06/editorsendorsement/ A.B.S. voter.



20120521 19:16:54 nbsp You should all be ashamed to allow this type of treatment of anyone who takes the time to help give more information with this community resource that NOBODY OWNS... not you Don Shor...
I have no idea why you singled me out, first on your list, Kemble. I have intentionally stayed out of the discussion there. I have made zero edits to the ChamberPAC page, and a total of three edits to the Chamber page over the course of five years.  Users/DonShor

 Your changes on the Chamber page are onesided and youve let your past feuds with the Chamber and DDBA cloud your judgement about ANYTHING that we do to try and improve this community.

20120521 20:40:49 nbsp I do appreciate your attempts at answers, although they were only halfsatisfactory, IMO. But perhaps thats just due to the limitation of the medium. I will give you the benefit of the doubt in this case. May you find peace in this short life and the root of all happiness. You are in my prayers, dear Kemble. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120612 17:36:08 nbsp Again, if you say it is inaccurate, then what is the accurate count?  I would be interested in your count, and then DS can say how he did his.  If you are disagreeing over what counts as a retailer, then showing how you did your counts would be revealing and informative.

Who the Chamber represents... exactly.  Part of that is who are its members.  If it disproportionately has certain types of members, then there is a reason for that, and it is information about the Chamber that some  including me  care about.  Retailers tend to be the businesses that many of us have the most personal relationships with and care the most about.  I think DS is right when he says that people tend to think that Chambers are made up of retailers.  It is not irrelevant.  List proportions of different types of members if you like, and explain what which businesses you consider to be of which type.

It very much looks like you are trying to delete information that you think reflects badly on the Chamber.  I am tired of you trying to whitewash the page.

20120612 18:06:36 nbsp If you object to my actions and my anonymity, take it up with the wiki community.

I am describing the behavior I see.  It looks like whitewashing to me.  I am describing my feelings about the Chamber.  They are (now) negative.  I assume that I am not alone in my reactions.  I could, of course, be wrong about that.  I have never claimed to take a survey.

I have said where I got my data from.  I got it from DS.  He has provided an elaboration of his data.  I have also invited you to provide alternate data to support your claim that DSs is wrong.  What is the problem?  Of course, any data will be a snapshot  thus, I put a date on the data that I cited.  It does not need to be updated monthly.

I am not trying to intimidate you.  I am trying to get you to stop whitewashing the page by deleting things, and to encourage you to add data rather than delete.  You carped at me for deleting just a few days ago.  Remember? Users/CovertProfessor
