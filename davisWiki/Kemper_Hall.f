Kemper Hall is named for John D. Kemper, former dean of the College of Engineering Footnote(Dateline UCDavis, http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id6561 Engineering II becomes Kemper Hall, 20030516.). This is where some engineering students at UCD spend most of their days (and nights).  Computer Science students live in the s(begin)basement labss(end) CSIF dungeon, with new grad students in the Grad Cave.  Some say that there is a spaceship underground at the heart of the building. It is part of the College of Engineering.

In the lobby there have been displays about the concrete canoe and a UAV built by the UAV Group 2004. The displays change over time as new projects are completed. One of the stairwells on the west side has doors that open onto a shaft that can be used for hoisting equipment into the building (or practicing rope rescue and rappeling).

Kemper Hall was formerly known as Engineering Unit 2, aka EU II, address(EU, 38.537122, 121.754854), Engineering 2 or simply Engineering for some.  If you look closely at the picture, you can see where they popped the II off.

Littleknown fact: There is an honest to goodness surgery robot in the basement of this building.
Betterknown fact: There are no medical students working in this building (or at least not that I know of).
Draw your own conclusions.

Other buildings in the College of Engineering include Bainer Hall and EU III.

Trivia: A scene from the movie Teknolust was filmed in this building.

Some of us old timers remember when the building was called EU II. So weve found EU II and EU III. Weve also noticed the same pattern with the dorms: Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, (and Primero Grove is the newest and its apartments). So we really want to know: why does this school only start counting with 2?




My understanding is that Bainer Hall Bainer was the first Engineering building and hence Engineering I

Actually the first engineering building was Walker Hall and if you look at the name above the door on it still says ENGINEERING even though the is obsecured by trees and the building has long since been converted for other uses. Users/AshleyOrsaba

My previous statement is only somewhat misleading.  Bainer wasnt the first Engineering building, but it was formerly named Engineering Unit I Users/AlexGarbutt

According to my parents (alums of UCD), there used to be an old residence hall called Primero, which was only recently torn down and rebuilt as Primero Grove. (Correct me if Im wrong anyone)

The original Primero was used as a dorm through the early 1990s.  It was torn down in the mid 1990s, and replaced with Primero Grove a few years later.  Users/IDoNotExist
