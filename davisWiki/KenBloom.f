Ken was a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate student, a member of Davis College Republicans, and the most obvious Orthodox Jew on Campus campus.


Kens email address is MailTo(kabloom AT ucdavis DOT edu).  Consequently, Kabloom is a nickname he has picked up amongst people that know him.  People say things like Kabloom is doing the next LUGOD meeting or Kabloom is in my ECS xyz class. Unfortunately, he couldnt get MailTo(kabloom AT gmail DOT com), so his next email address wont be the same explosion after he graduates. It will be MailTo(kbloom AT gmail DOT com).

Ken graduated on June 17, 2005, with high honors, and is now a graduate student at http://www.iit.edu/ Illinois Institute of Technology (in Chicago).

He loves wikis, and his new website is http://www.iit.edu/~kbloom1/. Its a wiki that only he can edit (at least for the time being).


Ken, I stumbled upon this looking for the hours of a restaurant, of all things... http://kabloom.com/ Oye! Users/MichelleAccurso

I dont even know Sean Davis, but he was listed as a professor elsewhere on the wiki, so I included him in the list. Who is he really? Users/EliseKane
   As Sean Davis his page says, hes a full time lecturer, and on the first day of his classes, he makes sure you know that.
