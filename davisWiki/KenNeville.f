Hi.

Im Ken Neville. Huzzah. I worked at Kens Bike & Ski for almost three years. Ive lived here on and off since Valley Oak Elementary School sixth grade (minus a few years for school and such), so I like to think I know my way around this place pretty well. Hopefully Ill add some useful stuff to this wiki! (Wow, I moved back to San Jose in September 2005... oh well.)

I dont work at Kens anymore, so please dont expect that page to get updated much by me anymore! :(

Here is a small picture of me using my webcam as a shaving mirror. Glad you stopped by.


Ken would like the Ben & Jerrys flavor Chubby Hubby. Because he likes peanutbutterfilled pretzels.  Users/RobRoy

I have known this guy for like 10 years, he is a good guy to know in Davis cuz hes got it wired!  If you see him out and about give him a howzit bra for me.  Ski your brains out his year! Aloha.  Users/ScottNaguwa scotty nugs
