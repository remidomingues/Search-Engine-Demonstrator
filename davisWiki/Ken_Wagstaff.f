His City Council also conceived and successfully placed Measures J and O before the voters. Measure J enacted the Citys procedure for voter approval of any new urban development outside the current City limits. Measure O inaugurated the Citys Open Space Acquisition program, which Wagstaff advocated to preserve agricultural lands and undeveloped space adjacent to the city or in its immediate environs. As Mayor, Wagstaff also enhanced the annual celebrations of Martin Luther Kings and Cesar Chavez birthdays, assuring that these events would remain a permanent part of the City events calendar.

He then worked on the 1997 referendum to stop the City from expanding the Richards Blvd. underpass into a fourlane tunnel, which would have clogged traffic at First Street. (Later, as Mayor, he successfully advocated for an alternative design to relieve traffic in the underpass a new turning lane allowing traffic entering the downtown to choose a right turn exit to First Street.)
