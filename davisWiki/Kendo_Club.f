What is Kendo?

Kendo is a Japan Japanese martial arts martial art based on traditional samurai sword fighting swordsmanship. Translated, Kendo literally means “the way of the sword.” Originally a way for samurai to train without injury or death, Kendo has since developed into a modern sport using protective armor, special clothing, and a bamboo sword to prevent serious injury to the participants.
