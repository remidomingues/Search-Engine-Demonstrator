I graduated from UCD in June 2004 with a major in Linguistics and minor in Ancient Greek.  I taught English for the Peace Corps in the town of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshkopi Peshkopi, Albania from 2007 to 2009.  Im half Japanese and half miscellaneous western EuropeanAmerican.  I miss Cafe Roma campus Roma.  I love the beer brewed at Sudwerk, especially their Doppel Bock.  I think Choice Voting is a terrific idea.

20041214 20:40:28 nbsp Sorry not exactly an expert on religion, atheist here : ). But I know that there are some Christian groups on campus that do no affliate with any particular sect which is what I was referring to  Users/JamesDawe

20041214 20:44:43 nbsp No worries, I know what you mean.  But those sects do espouse uniquely Protestant ideas.  Im pretty much an atheist myself, but I grew up in the Evangelical culture and thats the culture that those groups belong to.  Users/KenjiYamada

20041214 20:51:21 nbsp Hmm so General Evangelical  nondenominal Protestant, got you. One question tho, why is First Year Baptist considered this and not Baptist? They dont exclude other sects?  Users/JamesDawe

20041214 21:02:23 nbsp Oh, youre right.  Haha, sorry.  Yes FBC is Baptist.  The line between nondenom Evangelical and Baptist, Methodist, etc. is often very thin or nonexistent though.  Users/KenjiYamada

20050127 03:26:38 nbsp Fun Kenji fact: his gf reguarly beats him at DoA 3 (but shed probably kick my ass, too) Users/GeoffJohnson

20050313 22:13:49 nbsp Since you are atheists...you might as well join AGASA! Users/GeorgeLewis

20050602 20:25:61 nbsp Hey Kenji, thanks for listening to my show and calling in! Sorry if I spooked you by guessing your last name because I saw your name on the Davis Wiki. Users/KarlMogel

20050808 23:51:12 nbsp You have the same first name as my dad! Users/AikoEnoki

20050813 02:35:20 nbsp Aw, Kenji, you dont agree with the musical part of my quote? Users/BrentLaabs

20050815 21:11:52 nbsp Hey Kenji, do you remember the names of the DCR members that came to that Thought Club meeting? BTW, hope my Hobbit segment satisfied your inquiry. Users/KarlMogel

20050830 12:57:54 nbsp Hey Kenji, Actually, if you go to http://www.inoculatedmind.com you can subscribe to the podcast of the show to catch the rest of that episode. I think its episode 1, the second, as opposed to episode 0, the first. Users/KarlMogel

20050924 16:37:05 nbsp good luck with the peace corps. one of my coworkers just finished up doing it, he said he really loved it and that it was a perfect way to spend time in his postcollege precareer life. Users/RobertHester

20051021 16:23:01 nbsp Kenji,  Funny question last night about the brainbattle.  Actually, you could try calling This Week in Science and asking the same question of Kirsten  I would be interested to hear her answer... Maybe I could respond to what she says on my show... and it could escalate back and forth? :) Users/KarlMogel

20051202 19:49:42 nbsp Re: GVCC Experiences comment: Im aware of that.  The quote is meant to speak for itself (although im also aware they might not agree with it) and the name is purely for the purpose of giving proper credit.  You may wish to delete that comment and put it on my page where i think it belongs. Users/AlexanderWoo

20051222 14:52:07 nbsp Hows that todo list coming, kenji? Users/ArlenAbraham

20051224 11:10:04 nbsp {{{KenjiYamada:To Do}}} Users/ArlenAbraham

20060208 16:31:10 nbsp This one time I thought Kenji made a wiki page with his mind but it turns out I was thinking of Users/PhilipNeustrom Users/GeoffJohnson

20060211 19:04:01 nbsp Hey Kenji, thanks for bringing the Wiki shirt down to the station! Users/KarlMogel

20060218 10:23:47 nbsp Wouldnt the nerd store sell... nerds? Users/ArlenAbraham

20060218 11:55:56 nbsp Yeah, sorry for not discussing it. Ill leave it as it is, but I really dont think it is a good naming trend. Not just for the reason that Arlen points out but because of the stigma that can be carried by an epithet. I mean in this case I may be biased because it happens to be a store I shop at, but do you really want to set a precedent like this for naming redirects based on intuitive epithets? What happens when apollostumpy grabs ahold of that idea? And I think if anything comic shop or game shop would be more appropriate redirects, but these titles are not exclusive to BW in Davis, and the search function is adequate for finding these pages based on content. Again, sorry for deleting your work, but it just seemed like a ridiculous and potentially hostile/mean thing to do (although you could have meant it affectionately). Users/RyanPrendiville

20060219 15:06:12 nbsp Yeah, I went ahead and junked it. There is however a potential for a larger nerds page on the wiki, listing what nerds are, what they like to do, where they can do it, ect. That way you could link to stores that offer nerdy things without directly labeling and limiting them in the fashion of a redirect. Just an idea, thanks. Users/RyanPrendiville

20060412 14:13:53 nbsp thnx for coming out to the city council meeting! Users/JamesSchwab

20060413 12:25:45 nbsp Yep I am going to keep asking them to agendize the issue for real discussion Users/JamesSchwab

20060802 02:22:30 nbsp You might try looking at the Food CoOp refrigerated cases for miso paste.  I think Ive seen it there. Users/JudithTruman

20060909 20:46:03 nbsp Kenji! You didnt say goodbye to me and Jeff! I hope youre doing well in Martinez, your show was good and its too bad that youre not doing it anymore, and that I lost a listener. Thanks for calling in when you did, if only more people would... :) Users/KarlMogel

20060925 15:29:20 nbsp Let me know how that one turns out. I read that as an alternate history book it was good, but that also the short amount of time spent at each point in time left te reader wanting more. Users/KarlMogel

Congrats on the Super Giant Burrito! ~Users/DavidPoole davePoole

20070319 20:52:33 nbsp What are you up to these days, Kenji? Users/KarlMogel

20070721 20:29:32 nbsp Thanks for your comment on the GVCC page, Kenji.  Hey, I studies linguistics and worked with the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Colombia and Papua New Guinea.  Wow!  Albaniathats amazing!  Were you there when President Bush visited? Users/RichLindvall

20070727 20:26:11 nbsp I took a short course that covered the basic aspects of phonetics, phonology, and grammatical analysis as well as a smattering of Bible Translation principles.  It intrigued me!  So I went back for more!  Ended up doing government relations in Colombia for a short time and then Community Development in Papua New Guinea.  Albania was always something like North Korea to me.  Have things become pretty westernized since they opened their doors? Users/RichLindvall

20070908 08:04:18 nbsp Hi, Kenji.  Thanks for your message.  We just had a 3day homestay student from Uzbekistan.  Yikes!  Their country was very proUS until recently, now its done an about face towards Russia.  Amazing how things change.  I suppose your situation could change the same way.  Hope you have a great weekend! Users/RichLindvall

20070917 12:32:27 nbsp youre in Albania? I was in Tirana and Peja (kosova) for 4 months right after the war in 99. Crazy place. hope you are having fun. Users/PxlAted
