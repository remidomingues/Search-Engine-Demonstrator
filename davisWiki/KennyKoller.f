Background

I moved from San Francisco to Davis in 2008 when my wife was accepted to the School of Veterinary Medicine. In the Bay Area I worked on various gadgets but there seems be very little opportunity for this sort of thing in Davis so I continue to consult for clients back that way. Engineering can be rewarding but playing guitar is what I love to do.

Interests

Alt.Country Music, Twangy Guitars, Harmony and Chord Theory

Embedded Systems Programming

Programming (Python, C++/C, C#)

Good Movies and Television

If you couldnt figure it out, you can add them to your entry (this page) by adding the code {{{Image(Nixie.jpg)}}} to your page.  Welcome to the Wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

For some reason nearly every gadget contained a laser. Unfortunately the one with the highest power was on the order of 20 milliwatts so you would have to train in on a supervillan for some time before they would feel its effect. Users/KennyKoller
