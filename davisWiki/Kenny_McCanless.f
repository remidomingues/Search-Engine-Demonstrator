Phone Number: (530) PMPJUCE

Office: former UCD Resident Advisors RA/local personality

Status: Taken (sorry)

If you were a student at UC Davis UC Davis in the past 6 years, chances are youll have either seen or met Kenny McCanless somewhere, be it in a class, on The Quad the Quad wearing nothing except cupid wings and a loincloth, on a jog in his red shorts, or seeing someone else on the streets say hello to him.  While not as celebrated or infamous as Rob Roy Rob Roy or as uniquely conspicuous as Users/BarnabasTruman Barnabas Truman, Mr. McCanless certainly qualifies as one of the most popularly known people in the local community.  Walking with him on campus means having roughly 4 out of 10 people come up to salute him, another 4 who he can name in the crowd, and another 4 who greet him but he cant name them right away. (And yes, that adds up to 12, not 10, but does a legendary figure not deserve some iota of romanticization? Can Paul Bunyan not cross Minnesota in three bounds?  Did Al Gore not invent the Internet?)

An unparalleled combination of magnetic gregariousness, effortless charm, wellmeaning mischief, passionate curiousity, compassionate introspection, and a propensity to be shirtless, Kenny is really more than a bunch of adjectives and is just a genuinely super nice guy.  A few bumbling paragraphs on DavisWiki really does not do the man justice, and the truth is, if youve met Kenny, well, youll feel like youve always known him, and hes always known you.  Guys will want him to be their best man when The Big Day comes, and gals will want him to be their stripper when the bachelorette party comes.  Dudes trust him with their women, and ladies trust him to look out for their boys.  Everyone looks to him for an impromptu Pimp Juice and BBQ party.  Consider yourself blessed if you know him.


Share your times and experiences with Kenny here.  Were certain youll have many.  As the man himself often says in such a simple, perfect word, Peace.
