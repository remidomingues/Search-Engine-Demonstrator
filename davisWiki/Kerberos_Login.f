Kerberos login is a username and password assigned to every one at UC Davis (staff, students, faculty). It is based on the wiki:WikiPedia:Kerberos_(protocol) Kerberos authentication protocol.

Kerberos passwords must be sufficently complex (no dictionary words, must include case variations, numbers, special characters) because they grant access to a large number of things.

Kerberos logins grant access to the following:
  Sisweb
  MyUCDavis
  UC Davis Email
  Moobilenet
  http://library.ucdavis.edu/ul/services/connect/setup/ Library Proxy Service
  isun.ucdavis.edu  or you can use a different login
  SmartSite
  UC Davis Computer Labs
  http://listproc.ucdavis.edu/ Listproc management   add/remove email lists
