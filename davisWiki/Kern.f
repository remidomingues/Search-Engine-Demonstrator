I used to describe myself as an anarchocapitalist Libertarian. Im not so sure about the Libertarian part any more.

Im still definitely a Transhumanist. Just waiting on consumer market Bruce Sterlingversion cyber eyes. I want the kind with IR sensitivity so Ill be able to see when my kids faces flush while fibbing. >)
