The Ketchum Institute for Pokémon Studies is part of the UC Davis College of Ag.  Researchers work on various aspects of pokémonhuman interactions, including capture and optimum training techniques.  They also work with various aspects of pokémon husbandry, producing new evolved forms.  UC Davis is responsible for evolving the first Charizard, one of the centers most well known accomplishments.

The center studies all sorts of pokémen, but it is particularly well known for its study of ground pokémen.

The center is located on campus in the courtyard of Hunt Hall, near the Plant and Environmental Sciences Building.  The area is currently undergoing renovation to add an additional pokémon gym.

The Ketchum Institute cooperates with the Davis Pokémon Center, cohosting the annual AdoptaPokémon fundraiser with them.  And coming this winter, Professor Oak will offer a course on training at the Experimental College.

Be sure to drop by on Picnic Day  they have a giveaway, and you could draw a ball with one of the rare pokémon!

In 1996, the center was the subject of a foiled robbery attempt by the Japanese terrorist group Roketto Dan.  The plot to steal research information was discovered by the hard work of the Aggie Hosts.  On a related note, many of the faculty here also hold appointments at the Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies.

The faculty here often collaborate with UCIs wiki:irvine:Donald Bren School of Pokémon Sciences, a leader in the study of water pokémon.

If you go this year, be sure to get there early.  The line to get in was very very long.  Its lucky that I had the time to see anything else! Users/IDoNotExist
