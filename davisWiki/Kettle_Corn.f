Kettle corn is heaven in a bag: popcorn popped in a large kettle with sugar and kept constantly moving so that the sugar melts and ever so slightly caramelizes over the popped kernel. No butter is added and therefore it is lower in fat than regular popcorn. It has a slightly sweet and slightly salty flavor, much lighter than caramel corn.

Quite possibly the most delicious substance known to mankind. It can be found at the Kettle Pop booth at the Farmers Market made fresh in a big cauldron right at the Farmers Market.  Samples are freely available in dispensers at the table.

It can also be found at Century Theatres in Sacramento.  Try adding M&Ms for a sweet, salty and chocolate cinema experience.

20070513 15:20:08 nbsp I like Kettle Corn even better than regular popcorn. It has a slightly sweet flavor but it is not as sweet as caramel corn. Users/Jedron

20070621 11:37:34 nbsp Its good stuff.  A bag a week at the farmers market is the right amount.  On a hot summer day, though the cooking of it looks pretty brutal. Users/RocksandDirt

20071012 10:55:29 nbsp It was the most wonderful popcorn Ive ever had before  the crunchiness, the flavor, the teeniest hint of salt...its just addicting. We just kept grabbing the samples until we felt guilty and purchased an extra large bag. Totally worth it.  Users/EvelinaChang

20100301 16:27:38 nbsp Ive always loved Kettle Corn, and my boys and I have made it an important part of our weekly trip to the Farmers Market. This past Saturday my younger son burst into tears when they told us they were done selling popcorn for the day at 12:45. When I asked why they close earlier than all the other booths on in the market, I was told by the guy  a new guy, I should add while he was eating a burrito, standing over the big, cold kettle, Because its Saturday. I suppose that was a good reason. Users/DrandyJones
