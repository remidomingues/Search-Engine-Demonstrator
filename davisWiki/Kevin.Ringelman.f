20080612 17:17:32 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Kevin, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for commenting on the Graduate Tutorial Services LLC entry, but it might be a better idea just to edit it and make it a more informative entry.  If you dont speak up and contribute what you know, who will?  Heck, I wrote most of the current content from Googling for information... everybody is trying to get accurate information, and youre in a position to assist, so it would be great if youd help out!  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
