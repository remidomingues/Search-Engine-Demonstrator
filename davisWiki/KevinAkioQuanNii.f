>Simply Amazing:<
>The true story of a man with too much time on his hands<

On Sept. 29th 1985, a day that will forever live in infamy, a man... no... a legend was born.  His true name, far too awesome to be heard by human ears, would cause a lesser mans brain to implode from simple overloading of awesomeness.  Thusly, he was given a name of awesomeness that was still comprehendable for man to hear: Kevin Akio Quan Nii.

I have two first names and two last names.  Awesome.

Is a member of the Davis Judo Team.
