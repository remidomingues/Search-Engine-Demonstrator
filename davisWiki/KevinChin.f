Keep in mind that I completely, blindly, I love Davis â™¥ Davis. Forever.

My favorite things in Davis are:
  Bicycles Anything The Flying Carousel of the Delta Breeze pedal Bike Commute Month powered. Why I came back. Why Ill never leave.
  Rocknasium. Interesting routes, awesome people (regulars, visitors, staff, everyone!)
  MU Games Area. Cheapest billiards on the best tables in town. Just dont bother a week before to about a week into each quarter, when the UCD Bookstore takes over the room for textbook space.
  Front Page Davis Wiki. Naturally.
  The Davis Bike Loop.  A great 12 mile ride with no more than half a dozen places where you have to watch for cross traffic. Nice.

My favorite dwiki pages are:
  I Hate Davis. Always good to have some perspective.
  Recent Changes. Intrigue. Drama. Passion. Edit War Warfare. Who needs television when you can refresh this page every 15 seconds?
  Random Page. Pages on Recent Changes always get the love. Random finds the rest.
  Departed Businesses. History lesson :( .

Bike Commute Month miles logged:
 2009  109 miles
 2008  176 miles
 2007  173 miles

Big Thank Yous to a few of our wonderful local organizations and businesses, without which I could not have finally built my fixie baby: the Bike Church (for providing roughly 80% of the parts and general awesomeness), APEX Cycles & Service APEX (for the cog and some really really helpful advice), Kens Bike & Ski (for tire, tube, andmost importantlybeing the place I could turn to for the stupid, seemingly unique bottom bracket tool I needed).

 The power. . . THE POWER!!! I have tasted of the sweet nectar that started the Great Revert War of Sigma Chi July 2005 (Or the more recent SlightlyLessGreat Revert War of Fall 2007 ASUCD Election Last Night.  Or the Great Scrimmage of Yolo County Jail Sometime Yesterday), and can now revel in the euphoria. My innocence lost, Xmy revert virginityXnbspXmy maidenheadX my CONTROL is now SUPREME!  At least till someone reverts it after me. kc

20070703 23:37:44 nbsp yay for creating a page on The Davis Song! Users/JessicaRockwell

20070703 23:54:55 nbsp Yes! the Davis songs pretty tight but more importantly I Wish I Was a TV is my personal favorite song of the moment. Users/JasonDunne

20070714 21:18:19 nbsp Hey Kevin  Ive really been focused on the basic structure. Im trying to make it more intuitive, but Im not sure if its working. Ive been doing the previewing, but then I always find something else... and then take off on another tangent. Ill try to get it all into single (or fewer) edits. Please take a look at the main page. I took some hints from DavisWiki, but have changed a lot of that now. Thank you for your comments. Users/steadyfrank

20070716 08:29:06 nbsp It is one of the best multis of Davis...  It starts in Davis doesnt it?  And then it wonderfully takes you away! he he. Users/WesHardaker

20070724 19:38:56 nbsp Hah. I was uploading the photo as you were working on the old one. It was confusing at first when I went to preview! Users/RobinLaughlin

20070802 13:57:24 nbsp I am of the opinion that all of dickjones edits should be undone. I remove those I think I can get away with. Users/WilliamLewis
 Is there a way to keep the owners response, but somehow infer the context? I originally restored dickjoness comment because it was deleted by the proprietor of the business in question, a practice Ive never liked (read: Sogas). Had anyone else deleted this comment I probably would not have cared. Leonardos response to it, however, adds some reputable quality to the establishment, so Im inclined to keep it.  I suppose the reason Im asking you about it is that. . . your mouse cursor seems to have this promiscuous physical longing for revert links. Though I think this comment should stay in the light of subsequent remarks, I dont hold to long revert wars :) . kc
  Looks as though my point is now moot. Positive owner participation is always a good thing. kc

20070806 14:06:28 nbsp The map will show all points for the page and then up to 15 nearby points.  Were you seeing too few points on the map, or was it maxing out at 15? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  it was showing 16 (page point plus A  O), but when Id trying to update the last location (Stones Cafe & Catering Stones) it wouldnt load the map at all, just a blank frame. Asked a friend to load the map on her computer, no success. Trying to load the map on another nearby page (e.g., Mace Market) had the same result. A third attempt on a page geographically further away (Community Park, in this case) did succeed, went back to Stones and reverted and the map appears again. Ive looked through to see if I typod something originally but dont see anything obvious. . . Ive realized that I had the same number of points all along since I wasnt giving one to Stones, just changing it.  Anyway, it seems to be working now, but Ill keep in mind the fifteenpoint rule for the future. kc
  Hi Kevin  I used Stones Cafe & Catering Stones as an example for possible http://loscutoff.com/maps/ tweaks to the map code ... let me know what you think. Users/VladLoscutoff
   Very nice. Thing about the letterlabeled points is that, without a list of what those points indicate, the larger markers have no frame of reference. Makes sense to have it on the normal gmaps page since youre given a list of search hits, but on wiki its just nice to know there are other wikified businesses nearby. Still would be nice to set a default zoom level, but your solution is certainly much cleaner.  kc
   Easy fix, when the map is created the gmap code is passed a zoom level (15), I bumped it up (16).  Try the page now (you may need to refresh to see the new code). Users/VladLoscutoff

20070819 20:43:18 nbsp Bad move redirecting the Arnold page. Its laced with Davis perspective. Users/WilliamLewis
  fair enough, but it still has the Davis perspective, just now on the sacwiki page.  people on dwiki searching it will find the redirect, go to the sacwiki page, still see the davis info, only now it can get some sac love as well. kc

20070819 20:47:30 nbsp Concurrency isnt an issue. SacWiki and DavisWiki are two separate projects. There is nothing that says the two pages have to be the same. In fact, they should not. SacWiki readers probably wont care about what Aaaahhhhnold has done in Davis. DavisWiki readers probably wont care about Aaaahhhhhnolds interaction with the city government. Each page should have the appropriate community perspective. Users/WilliamLewis
  understoodsorry for the trouble! kc

20070822 22:41:41 nbsp >_< I have tainted donuts in... MPG... its 82 mb... right now... Im staring at it thru spacemonger Users/StevenDaubert

P.S. yeah its a classic for sure, and its smooth editing... Have you seen SuberunkerStudeoshFootball?

20070823 11:26:02 nbsp HEY! Thanks for the Tainted Donuts vid! It was AWESOME! lol. Very good editing Users/ArianeMetz

20070825 19:26:19 nbsp Hello Kevin,
I was unaware I could create a page here on Wiki until today, thank you for commenting to Users/Samantha about my lack there of, now I know I can.  My comments about Spa Central arent angry, though Ill agree theyre bitting, but everything I said is true.  I know first hand what kind of person the owner is and how she treats her employees, and not just myself.  I could have gone on for pages, I kept a log of how I was mistreated after the receptionist repeatedly overscheduled me, keeping me from being able to pump milk for my daughter.  They were investigated not only for not having Work Comp Insurance but also, and unrelated to me, for denying employee breaks.  Please do not hold against me the fact that I feel strongly enough to write my negative opinion of Spa Central, I have other possitive opinions about the Davis community, and they are expressed on CitySearch, I didnt even know Davis Wiki exsisted until a friend sent me Spa Centrals Wiki Link. You might feel the same way I do if you had worked at Spa Central and been treated the way I was. ~Namaste~ Users/ElisaWeller
  No worries, Elisamy comment was not so much directed towards your negative experience as it was to Samanthas attempted removal of it. This is a sore point amongst those who attempt to maintain the wiki regularly, and I apologize if I initally dismissed your comment. kc
