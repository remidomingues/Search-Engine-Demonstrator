Hello.

I own a little Sophias restaurant and bar in town.

During the warmer months in Davis, I book http://www.sophiasthaikitchen.com/live_events.cfm live shows 34 nights a week.

Many people just know me as The Quizmaster from a weekly Trivia Nights Trivia Night on Tuesdays. I write the quiz, ask the questions, grade the papers, and make fun of the answers and scores. Its sometimes obnoxious, often pretentious, mostly fun. If you have a good question, feel free to let me know so I can take credit for it as my own.

You can mailto:kevin@sophiasthaikitchen.com email me if you want. I might even reply.

And theyve got a surprisingly solid beer selection.  I also liked the pastries at Stonegate quite a bit this weekend.  Its a great little shopping center. Users/TomGarberson
