I have been in Davis since 1 March 2005, when I came out to join my future wife, Christine. XI work at the Davis Food CoopX Im a freelance writer and blogger, writing online and off.

Online, I write at my Davis blog http://wertperch.blogspot.com An Englishman in Davis and my beer blog http://realbeer.wordpress.com An Englishman in California, on Beer, at http://www.everything2.com Everything2 as wertperch.

You may note that many of my edits have what may appear to be peculiar spellings; I spell very well indeed thank you, just in an English accent. If I add or edit something and it offends or looks wrong to you, then you should change it to something more Websterian. Darn that http://www.everything2.com/user/wertperch/writeups/Noah+Webster Noah Webster, anyway.
