Candidates Statement:

Hello fellow UC Davis students! My name is Kevin Massoudi and I am running for ASUCD Senate as an Independent candidate. Since arriving here at Davis, I have served the campus and students to the best of my ability, working both within and outside ASUCD to better student life as well as give presence to student voices during administrative discussions. A vote for me will be a vote for experience and dedication, with no constraining party line ideals.

As a Senator I will have four main goals that will be accomplished. First, I want to work to reduce ASUCD’s paper waste dramatically. By reversing a ban of electronics at Senate meetings, we can allow Senators and others sitting in at meetings to opt for an electronic copy of documents being circulated, saving precious resources and money for the students.

Second, in line with my commitment to reducing UC Davis’s environmental impact, I want to work with TAPS to eliminate the restrictions placed on carpool permits.  At this time, only students living outside of Davis city limits are allowed to apply for the discounted carpool permits being offered. By lifting this ban students stand to save $300 a year, and a ridesharing community will be encouraged.

Third, it is my goal to have wireless internet available throughout the entirety of the UC Davis central campus. We are a leading national research university and the necessary educational resources we provide our students are essential to the continued success of the university.

Finally, I will work with the administration to bring back one of the unique aspects of student life that went missing just last year. I speak of course, of the EPIC QUAD BATTLE!

Thank you for your consideration. Please vote Independent KEVIN MASSOUDI #1 for ASUCD Senate!

20090116 00:13:35 nbsp Kevin is a standup guy that everybody thinks is awesome. He has real experience, I know this because hes been serving with me on the Internal Affairs Commission for the past year. Not only does he hold the position, he uses it with the authority of change. Kevin was one of the loudest voices against closeddoor student government policies. He also works hard outside of his commission work to make positive change for students. Hes made important strides in working towards increased wireless coverage for UCD. A lot of candidates are going to make promises and will try to make up experience. Kevins been doing stuff and has experience that is beyond titles and positions.

Theres a reason Im backing Kevin Massoudi  the students. Users/GregWebb
