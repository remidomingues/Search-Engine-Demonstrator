Professor Kevin Roddy is perhaps the closest they come to being the quintessential college faculty professor. He is most noted for wearing his doctoral robes during lecture.
He was originally involved in computers (He even wrote a book about http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail//0030001676/qid1144898638/sr12/refsr_1_2/10304699596473415?vglance&sbooks UNIX word processing utilities) but after the outsourcing of jobs overseas, he became a Medieval Studies professor. Roddy was an undergraduate at Gonzaga University and graduated with a B.A. in English. He has a M.A. in English from the University of Iowa, and holds a Ph.D in English from UC Davis. The Professor has also written some poetry pieces that can be found on his http://medieval.ucdavis.edu/KEVIN/ website and has a painting he did of the Newman Center on display at Newman. Roddy is very supportive of the Newman Community and generously assists in many of their events. It is rumoured Roddy once fought 4 bears by himself, and has a secret covenant with God.

Roddy runs class Discussion Sections discussions himself, though he often tries to get the students to facilitate it. You will be definitely surprised the first time youre handed back a paper in Roddys class; he has a reputation for ripping position papers apart. Roddy even has rare artifacts and documents (some obtained through questionable circumstances), causing some to liken him to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones Professor Jones. Many freshmen may be surprised when he knows your name after the first week of class. One thing is certain (aside from the fact his name is Kevin Roddy, and he lives in Village Homes Davis), after having a class with him, you will either hate his guts or love him to death.

Roddy was featured in http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/02/27/Features/Aggies.In.Shining.Armor1638941.shtml?norewrite200605081357&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com The California Aggie on Feb. 27, 2006.

Roddy has supported LEAD in the past, and proStudent Focus discussions have occurred in his class as well.

Roddy was arrested (along with 24 others) in an act of civil disobedience as part of the foodservice union demonstrations on UCD May 1, 2007: Day of Action May 1, 2007.

Roddy will retire at the end of Spring quarter 2010. His final quarter has been marked by a number of unusual happenings: A chorus of singers in the library and the second coming, to name a few.

20111122 08:26:54 nbsp Dr. Roddy was the best instructor I had at UCD period. I learned more (and more about learning) from the 3 classes I had with him than all the others combined. The A I received on one of his position papers is the achievement I am most proud of of my entire academic and postacademic career. Lance 95 Users/LanceLarka
