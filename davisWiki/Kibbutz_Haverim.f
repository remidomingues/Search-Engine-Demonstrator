Kibbutz Haverim is the Jewish Student Union Cooperative Housing Coop. It is located near Alpha Gamma Omega, at Parkway Circle on campus. It can house between 10 and 14 people. All of the current residents are moving somewhere else at the end of this year, so all of these spaces are available in the 20052006 academic year. Visit the Hillel House for more information.

The name is Hebrew: קיבוץ חברים. For those who cant read Hebrew, Kibbutz Haverim should be pronounced kibUts xAvajr\im (transcribed according to the wiki:WikiPedia:XSAMPA XSAMPA system).


I would just say that the H should be pronounced like the ch in Bach, but Americans tend to pronounce that wrong too. The sound doesnt exist in English. Users/KenBloom
