20080712 23:25:18 nbsp Hi Kicker, I think your name is Scott. Could be Casey, or who ever.... you should use your real name. I hope you are happy with the comments you have made about our facility. I am not sure where all this anger is coming from but it would be nice to talk to you face to face instead of hidding behind a computer and trying to damage my business. You know I am a good person and depend on this business to take care of my family, do you have any children? If you have anything to say, I would appreciate you being honest with yourself and just look at what will become of spreading negative (untrue) comments about me personal comments that are hurtful and very ugly. I would appreciate if you would go to Peak Proformance and stop with the lashing, we get it...  Users/TammyHengel

Davis Swim and Fit
Attn: Tammy Hengel
Club Manager
Davis CA


Per your request here is documentation in writing that I am not now nor have I ever been a member of Davis Swim and Fit. I signed up to be a member of 24 Hr Fitness and never used or visited your facility. I am told that 24 Hr fitness sold my membership to your club in October of 2006 but continued to honor my membership at their clubs through early 2008.

Davis Swim and Fit was taking electronic fund  transfers from my Golden 1 Checking Account through September of 2009.  I was told by 24hr club managers that Davis Swim and Fit was a 24 hr Fitness Club that I was a 24hr Fitness member and that the debits were going to the club of original record.

I was never a member of Davis Swim and Fit I signed up to be a member of 24 hr Fitness and have never visited your club or even know where it is located.

I have turned this matter over to the Fraud dept at Golden 1 and will make every attempt to recover the $480.00 that was illegally taken from my account by your club.
Please consider this notice that I do not now nor ever want to be a member of Davis Swim and Fit and further attempts to withdraw funds from my account will not be processed. I demand a full refund for funds taken from October 2007 September 2008.

Most Sincerely,


Tamara Morgan
