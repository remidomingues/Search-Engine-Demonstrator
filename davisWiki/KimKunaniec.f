About me:
  I grew up in El Sobrante.
  I generally suck at visual arts, but tend to be a decent writer.
  People like me better when I show up with food.  So Im going to study to be a pastry chef.
  I spent a ton of my time involved with ASUCD and CalPIRG.
  I am 70% homebody, 30% partier.
  I love Karaoke night at Cantina del Cabo.  But I almost never sing, because Im lacking that talent too.
  I always have my nose in other peoples business.
  Some days, I think I have no life.  Other days, I think I have too much of a life.
  I finished at Davis in December, and have since moved back to the Bay Area, but I cant seem to get detangled from ASUCD.
  I start classes at the California Culinary Academy at the end of March.


Hey, I grew up in El Sobrante, too!  El Ratton Court was the street I lived on.  What kindergarden did you go to?  I bet we went to the same one.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

I lived on Santa Rita for most of my life, and I went to Sheldon from kindergarten through 5th grade.  Users/KimKunaniec
