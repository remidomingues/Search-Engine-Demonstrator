My name is Kim Wong and Ive been in Davis 20082011. I graduated from UC Davis in June 2010 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences, Emphasis in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. I worked full time as the study coordinator for the UCD Dept of Public Health Sciences and MIND Institute for an Autism study, Markers of Autism Risk in Babies  Learning Early Signs (MARBLES). I sing with the Gospel Choir at UC Davis (which used to be a class but is a club now due to budget cuts). I am part of the Davis Christian Fellowship community.

Im leaving to go work with children rescued from sex slavery in India for a year.
