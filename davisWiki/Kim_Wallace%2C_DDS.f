20070619 10:45:52 nbsp Dr Wallace is wonderful. He is not only a gifted dentist, but a very kind, sweet person. The office staff is cheerful and friendly, they remember you and are always helpful. This is one of the absolute best dental practices I have used over the past 40 years. Oh, and they stream custom recorded music, so the listening is great. Users/Treacher

20070911 12:40:34 nbsp I have been seeing Dr. Wallace since 1986.  I am a total wimp when it comes to dentistry...but Dr. Wallace has always been kind and gentle and I keep going back!  I now take my children there as well, and they are very comfortable with him.  I highly recommend him and his staff.  They are absolutely wonderful. Users/MBS

20071201 10:52:08 nbsp This dentist office goes so far and beyond all other offices I have been to in the past, it is like a 20 on a scale of 110. Everyone is very friendly, and they are willing to take their time to make sure that you understand everything you need to to take care of your teeth! Users/sweetMeliss

20071221 18:07:55 nbsp I would highly recommend Dr. Wallace to anyone looking for a dentist.  His staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, plus Dr. Wallace is very good at explaining your options and helping you feel at ease. Users/VladLoscutoff

20071231 12:15:35 nbsp By far, the most thorough dental exam Ive ever had. Very friendly.  Users/nls

20080410 13:28:51 nbsp Wow!  I couldnt be happier, and it is not b/c I dont have anything wrong with my teeth.  It is b/c the level of care here is so high.  They treat you with kindness and make sure you are well informed and educated to as part of your treatment.  I also like that I have been given several options for dental care depending on my budget.  I have never had this level of service or care at a dentist office. Users/lemurific

20080618 16:09:03 nbsp Dr Wallace was so good with even toddlers! I was very impressed.  Users/youkai

20081029 17:08:12 nbsp Ive been going to Dr. Wallace for years now. I had no idea how good he was until I had some mediocre to bad experience with a dentist in the Bay Area. Now that I am back in town, I really appreciate his flawless, professional service. A very trustworthy dental practice, Recommended! Users/supernova365

20081118 11:22:17 nbsp Dr. Wallace is fantastic.  The entire staff has always been extremely nice and helpful, and everybody seems to really enjoy their job.  This is reassuring for patients who probably arent thrilled to be there.  And the new office is really nicethe chairs have a massager built in, which seemed gimmicky at first, but provides a very useful distraction when your teeth are being scraped and picked. Users/MatthewPearson

20090123 19:20:18 nbsp Dr. Wallace and his staff are great. Hes very thorough  which is kinda disheartening when you realize your oral care regimen is not as good as you thought it was.. ::ahem:: but thats what makes him a great dentist. He doesnt miss anything and he is sincere about keeping your teeth healthy. Users/MichellePalmer

20090201 18:40:03 nbsp I had my first appointment with Dr. Wallace this last week and had a great experience.  Everyone on staff is very friendly and makes sure you are feeling comfortable. During my appointment each step was clearly explained to me  how many xrays they would be taking, the machine they were using  and any issues they noticed were explained to me while I held a mirror so I could see what they were talking about.  At the end of my appointment they carefully went over dental care  more so than Ive had ever had happen before  looking at my brushing and flossing technique and letting me know what I should add/change.
My husband had to make an emergency appointment in December and they were able to slot him in (even though he was a brand new patient).  Even though his appointment was because he was in pain  he also was very pleased with his experience (and he tends to dislike dentists immensely).
If you are looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend checking out Dr. Wallace and his team. Users/AnnaD

20090508 08:22:23 nbsp I would certainly recommend this dentist (and in fact I have to my family). Dr. Wallace is very friendly and competent and does his best to ease any nervousness you may be feeling. I do not have insurance so I had to pay out of pocket for his services and the prices for the cleaning, xrays and fillings were quite reasonable in comparison to a lot of the other well rated dentists on this site (I called many, many of them before choosing Dr. Kim). Not to mention the staff is extraordinarily nice, especially Beth.  Users/psycomech

20091015 22:50:34 nbsp I made an appointment to have a checkup and teeth cleaning done, but he said he did not have the equipment to do an xray in my case. It was fine that he does not have the equipment because I was hoping to have the teeth cleaned. He did not clean my teeth in the end, told me that I did not have cavities, and charged $49. It really costs too much for not having anything done. Users/dashiel709

20100217 12:04:20 nbsp Dr. Wallace is the most skillful dental practitioner Ive ever encountered. His shots are close to painfree, he picks up small things that other dentists miss (e.g., small cavities), and he works from a high tech state of the art office that utilizes digital imaging. In addition, his fees have always been reasonable, and he is highly responsive as well. Those of us who have him as a dentist are very fortunate indeed.    Users/johnhamilton

20100812 10:35:18 nbsp I chose to make an appointment with Dr. Wallace after seeing reviews here. I hadnt been to a dentist in years, and I was a little nervous about what he would find. From Xrays, to the examination, to the cleaning, everything were really smoothly. Nobody made me feel the least bit bad that I hadnt gotten an exam in years. A great experience in the end. Users/AsmaMaryamMohseni

20101120 11:54:12 nbsp WOW!  I had the same dentist for 30 years in New York.  Even when I moved to California, I would go back to him.  A few years ago, I went somewhere else in Davis, and it was not a pleasant experience.  I hadnt been back to the dentist since, but I was riddled with mouth pain and I talk for a living.  Doctor Wallaces office fit me in right away, gave me some major relief from the pain and set me up for a cleaning next month.  The office was large, incredibly clean and lots of good magazines.  Dr Wallace is very knowledgable and takes lots of time to explain your options.  His staff (all women?) are incredibly nice, seriously, incredibly nice.  Im actually looking forward to my cleaning and Im excited to bring my daughter in for her first time, too.  I have a feeling shes going to love Dr Wallace as much as I loved my Dr Wasserman back in New York.  When you find a dentist you love, its hard to go anywhere else! Users/ElisaAllechant

20110206 11:13:28 nbsp I would definitely recommend Dr. Wallace and his staff! Everything about my visit was explained to me and I was able to ask plenty of questions. Plus, they have massage chairs. Users/KelseyCondell

20120604 16:59:50 nbsp I would not recommend Dr. Wallace. Years ago when I was in graduate school, he was my regular dentist and I went to him for routine cleanings and exams. I never had to have any major work done, but he botched my husbands crown and it had to be fixed by another dentist. At the time, my husband and I were trying to conceive, so during one visit I politely declined the XRay. He snapped at me, Next time you come in, I dont care what time of the month it is, youre getting an XRay. It was humiliating. I left and never went back. Fifteen years later, we find ourselves back in the area looking for a new dentist. Needless to say, it wont be Kim Wallace. Users/Jill.C
