Kindermusik offers music classes for children ages 07 and their parents.  The program is based on research demonstrating the benefits of music at each stage of a childs development. They start from where your child is, regardless of his age, and provide activities that stimulate his mind, body, and sense of play.

Amy Levin is a licensed Kindermusik educator and teaches music classes for children ages 07 in Davis.  Contact Amy if you are interested in enrolling your child or trying out a class, and she will send you more info.
