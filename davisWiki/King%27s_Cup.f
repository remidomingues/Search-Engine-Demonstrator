Please remember that there are many different versions of this game.  The Rules below are offered as examples.  Many claim to know the universal rules; there are none.  Please see the bottom of the page for a more complete listing of possible rules.  Certain versions have been known to be called NineNineBustARhyme.


 GETTING STARTED 

 MATERIALS 

 1 Deck of playing cards

 1 large cup

On a table arrange an entire deck of cards face down around a large empty cup. Each person has a turn drawing a card, and every card drawn corresponds with an action (see key below). Whether it is making a rule, or giving out drinks, each card makes people do something.

Whenever a King is drawn, the person who drew the card pours as much of their drink as they would like into the large cup in the circle of cards.

The goal of the game is not to get the last king, as drawing the last king means you must then chug the Kings Cup!

If you break the circle of cards (so they arent all touching) then you must take a drink.

 Strategy 

Strategy in this game is easier to apply early on in the game when there are more cards and more sobriety.

When using categories  pick a category with a limited number of correct responses to make a particular person (this requires knowing how to count), popular categories for this purpose are:

  Total days in a month (four responses  28, 29, 30, 31)
  Members of a band (I.E. Members of Led Zeppelin, four correct responses)
  Books by a less than prolific or obscure author
  Harry potter books (useful for a large group of players, 7 correct responses)
  Courses in the BIS 1 series (3 responses.. hopefully)
  Songs over 8 minutes long (most people screw this up after a few drinks, expect the first person to answer freebird and the progheads of your group)
  Be creative!

If you are a real ahole, you will pick something difficult to rhyme with when drawing a 9, dont just say I just ate an orange. seriously. Seriously.

When drawing a 10, be creative in your sanctions, but dont be a dick, this pays off later on when youve drank too much and cant remember your own rules.  Alternately, you can create the simple rule that every card is now a createarule card.  Within a few minutes, you will be playing a drastically altered game.
