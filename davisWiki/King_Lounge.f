King Lounge is a slightly noiser version of Griffin Lounge.  It is on the second floor of the MU (go up there and wander; youll find it).  It is a little off the beaten path, and not in King Hall, but seems to have more character because of this. In King Lounge, students can be seen studying, chating with friends, watching tv and Sleeping On Campus.



Named after Burton King.
