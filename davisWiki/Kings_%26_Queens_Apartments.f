20080721 18:23:05 nbsp I live here and its a great place to live. The rent is very very cheap for a one bedroom, Dave the manager is friendly and great, and my neighbors are all pretty friendly. I am a college student, but not many (if any outside of me) live here.  Users/AlvinTsao

20121108 10:59:37 nbsp I currently live here in a onebedroom and it is pretty nice. It is not a senior complex anymore, is the lowest price in Davis, and centrally located. It is not noisy and water is included in the rent. No pets are allowed, assigned parking(yes the trees are just sticky like everywhere in Davis...). It is a nofrills complex that is rarely updated but still wellkept.  Users/AnnieP
