 Candidate Statement

Hey fellow Aggies! My name is Kirby Araullo (yes, like the little pink guy!) and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the SMART Slate. SMART seeks to create an inclusive environment on campus that provides a quality, culturally sensitive, comprehensive education for students of all backgrounds. I am a Senior History and WarPeace Studies transfer student from Cerritos, California. I am currently an intern for ASUCD Senator Jared CrisologoSmith, and BRIDGE: The Pilipin@ Outreach & Retention Program at the Student Recruitment & Retention Center (SRRC). I am also a volunteer at several other components of the SRRC, including SAFE (Southeast Asians Furthering Education), AIRR (American Indian Recruitment and Retention), Collective (Transfer Support Program), and, Yik’al Kuyum (the Chican@ Latin@ Holistic Support Program). I am also involved with the Asian Pacific American Leadership Committee (APALC). By serving my community in these various capacities I have had first hand experience with students from many different backgrounds and am aware of the issues they face daily.

My Platforms:

MORE TEXTBOOK RESERVES
Being in college nowadays is expensive. The heavier the books are the more painful they are for your wallets. I will work to help students save money by creating a textbook reserve located in the new Student Community Center, supplementing the Shields Library Reserves and giving students muchneeded additional study space and free access to the most common GE books.

A MORE EMPOWERED, DYNAMIC, AND SAFER UC DAVIS COMMUNITY
Safety is always an issue in every community. Many ASUCD candidates have ran for campus safety by addressing issues like more lighting and tighter security. However, many times security concerns or the feeling of being unsafe is a result of misunderstandings between students from different backgrounds. By creating a more inclusive safe space throughout our campus and nurturing greater cultural awareness among our communities I aim to help eliminate these misunderstandings.

ENSURE EQUITABLE FUNDING
I will ensure equitable and sustained support for programs benefiting student communities of all backgrounds. These are programs that aim to further the community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring as stated in our Principles of Community. These programs include, but are not limited to; Community specific graduation programs, Student of Color Conference, leadership retreats, cultural weeks, etc.

Our world today is like a crayon box in which we all come from different backgrounds. We can all choose to work individually, secluding ourselves because of differences, or work with one another by complementing and understanding each other’s similarities and differences to paint a more vibrant and inclusive community.

Be Smart! VOTE for me, KIRBY ARAULLO, #1 for ASUCD Senate and Vote SMART #25!

We aim to advocate for student rights and create a legitimate student representation on campus. :)
