Kirsten is often told that she has an invalid name when typing it into websites due to the apostrophe in her last name.


She made this page so people can respond to her edits as Users/MaxMikalonis someone expressed an interest in replying to an earlier post.  One of her favorite pastimes in Davis is to watch the Recent Changes recent changes page as the number of edit wars and the comments listed for changing a page become more humorous everyday.

Weird true fact #1
Kirsten is allergic to fruits and vegetables but still eats them anyway because they are delicious.  And who really needs to breathe?

Weird true fact #2
She can say the alphabet backwards in about 3 seconds.


Kirstens current favorite Eddie Izzard Quote
But there must have been a Death Star canteen yeah?  There must have been a cafeteria downstairs.  In between battles where Darth Vader could just chill.  I will have the pene a la arabiatta.  Youll need a tray.  Do you know who I am?  Do you know who I am?  This is not a game of who the sic are you.  For I am Vader, Lord Vader.  I could kill you with a single thought.  Well youll still need a tray.  No I do not need a tray, I do not need a tray to kill you.  I could kill you without a tray.  With the power of the force for which is strong within me.  Even though I could kill you with a tray if I so wished for I would hack at your neck with the thin bit until the blood flowed across the canteen floor.  No the food is hot youll need a tray to put the food on.  Oh I see the food is hot Im sorry I did not realize.  (laughs)  Oh I thought you were challenging me to a fight to the death.  Fight to the death?  This is canteen I work here.  Yes but I am Vader. I am Lord Vader. Everyone challenges me to a fight to the death.  Lord Vader, Darth Vader?  Im Darth Vader.  Lord Vader, Sir Lord Vader?  Sir Lord Darth Vader?  Sir Lord Vader?  Sir Lord Vader of Cheem?  Sir Lord Baron Von Vader Ham?  The Death Star?  I run the Death Star?  Whats the Death Star?  This is the Death Star!  Youre in the Death Star!  I run this star!  This is a star?  Yes!  I run it, Im your boss!  Youre Mr. Stevens?  Mr Steve Who is Mr Stevens?  Hes head of catering.  No! I am not head of catering!   I am Vader.  I can kill catering with a thought.  What?  I can kill you all.  I can kill me with a thought.  Just, oh, Ill get a tray.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  This one is wet.  Did you dry these in a rain forest?  Why, with the power of the Death Star can we not have a tray that is dry? I do not, no no no no I was here first.  You have to form a queue if you want food.  Uh.., oh can I have pene a la arabiatta that would be very nice.  No no no, do you know who I am?  Thats Jeff Vader that is.  I am not Jeff Vader I am Darth Vader.  What Jeff Vader runs the Death Star?  No, I run the Death Star.  You Jeff Vader?  No Im Darth Vader.  Are you his brother? Can you get his autograph?

And you and everyone in this canteen.  Death by tray it shall be.  Ooooo.  Do you want peas with that?  Peas!  You dont have peas!  You cant put red with you cant put it doesnt work.  Unless you push them up the pene tubes and then that would be weird.  Just, oh all right put some peas on.  That was cut out of the final film.






One of the things Kirsten enjoys the most is color.  She used to dye her hair funky colors about once a month but is now attempting to become a little more normal and is refraining from the periodic updates to her appearance.  Of course every now and then it comes out somehow.  This might explain why St. Patricks Day is one of her favorite holidays.  Well, that and shes a little bit Irish.

After a brief introduction with a bench, she has also decided to become the biggest advocate of looking in the direction that you are running.  If you must turn your head to look in another direction: STOP RUNNING.  She says Trust me, you do not want a hole in your leg from where Mr. Shin met Ms. Bench.

On a More Superficial Level...
She is a brother of Delta Sigma Pi, a coed professional business fraternity.  She has also decided to major in Sociology Organizational Studies and Communication.  She also doesnt remember what her natural hair color is.  She also likes to cut and/or dye her hair whenever things are becoming too hectic.  This basically means she does things like this at a minimum of once every two weeks.
