Kirsten Elise Young completed her BFA in studio art under the redwoods at the University of California in Santa Cruz. Following her education, she was awarded the Maggie and Bob Allessee Fellowship, which involved a year long artist residency onboard Artrain USA, a traveling art museum housed in vintage railway cars that brings visual art to rural communities.
Since then, she has returned to California, continues to paint, often using found materials to compose images of birds, portals, and abstract landscapes. A recipient of the City of Davis Art Contract program, Kirsten originated “Hoop Happenings,” a project that involves outdoor events incorporating music and hulahoops in order to cultivate creativity, community, and evolution in consciousness. Last Spring, Kirsten traveled to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico as part of the starry night artist in residence program where she created her most recent body of work called Dreamscapes, recently on display in Davis at Delta of Venus.
