Kitt and Kyle are two Siamese brothers who Elizabeth Barthel of Elizabeths Pet Sitting  adopted from Sacramento when they were just 8 weeks old. They love dogs and can be found lounging on the couch or sunbathing in the front yard. They are well mannered and love to fetch Kong Wubba mice and love any toy with a feather on it.
