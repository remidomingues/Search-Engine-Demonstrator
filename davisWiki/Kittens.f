The Yolo County SPCA Has Many Adoptable Cats and Kittens!

Fostering: The SPCA has lots of cats but very few foster homes. To consider fostering Mailto(cats AT yolospca DOT org)

Many cats end up in shelters, and are euthanized. The SPCA is trying to reduce that problem, by rescuing as many cats as they can!

Cats are very nice pets and are good with kids. Consider adopting an SPCA cat/kitten today!
