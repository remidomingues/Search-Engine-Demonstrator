20090310 17:14:15 nbsp Ive used Kiwi Tree for several years now and Ive always been quite pleased. They always did a great job whether it was removing dead trees and grinding out the stumps, or trimming the branches of our fruit trees. They are also very reasonable on pricing, friendly, and honest. After paying them they needed to come back because of a equipment problem and the did without any prompting. Id recommend them without question. Users/templets

20101011 18:23:04 nbsp Best tree service ever  theyve helped me several times, most recently today when they left their dinner to come to the Coop and free a car that was pinned under a fallen branch. Super nice, super smart and good rates too. Users/JulieCross

20120814 13:39:01 nbsp Kiwi Tree did a quick and effective job removing some large, precarious branches that were growing out of a Mulberry Tree into our house and our neighbors house. They let me deal with the green waste to save $$. Actually the whole thing seemed pretty cheap considering the risk involved in operating power tools while climbing.  Users/MikeyCrews

20130416 17:07:51 nbsp (MJones) I am grateful for your verbal applause of my tree work. Yet I find no mention of your name in my database. Perchance you be using a Nom de Plume. Maybe you have Kiwi Tree confused with another Tree service? Anyhow please feel free to call me at (530) 2205650, to clarify that my wife is not alittle out there in left field
