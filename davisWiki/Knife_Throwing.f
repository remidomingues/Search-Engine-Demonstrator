The classes were by appointment only, Dr. Colvin has moved his practice to Berkeley.  Dr. Colvin taught oneonone and group classes. Dr. Colvin provided knives for practice, but recommended that the students buy their own knives.  Recommendations, (based on the student attending), were made at the first class as to what type to buy.

Dr. Colvin provided a primer on existing California law as it pertained to the ownership, possession and transport of throwing knives.  It was recommended that until the student had received this information that they DID NOT bring any knives to class, or carry them in public.
