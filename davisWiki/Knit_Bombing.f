Knit Bombing (also called graffiti knitting) has become increasingly popular in Davis and the effects of these random acts of knitting can be seen all over town.  The Davis Food Coops Knitting and Craft Circle http://www.youtube.com/watch?vj_oTGSzmGc&featureshare made a video of their knit bombings,

There are a couple of knit bombs near the coop on the South side of the parking lot. Looks good ~SD
