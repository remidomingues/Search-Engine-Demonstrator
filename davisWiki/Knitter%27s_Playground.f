Knitters Playground was located downtown and offered a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere and supplies knitters and crocheters with the inspiration, instruction, yarn and tools they needed to create any project. Knitters Playground also hosted http://www.fiberelements.com/ Fiber Elements, enabling the store to offer a greater variety of yarn and tools. They also had WiFi Hot Spots WIFI offered for the student knitter  coffee welcome!  There was an enclosed kids area so parents can relax and keep an eye on happy children and an elevator for the stairschallenged.

Goodbye Letter

Dear Customers and Friends,
Today, we write to you unfortunately, with sad news and good news:

Due to circumstances beyond our control, it has become apparent that the current local economy is insufficient to support our location at 132 E Street in downtown Davis. This however, does not mean that our services to knitters, crocheters, weavers, felters, and handspinners will disappear.

The sad news is that Knitters Playground will be going out business as a retail storefront; the good news is that Fiber Elements will remain in business moving its inventory back to the original location. The last day of business operations will be Saturday, Oct. 27th and the inventory at the Mansion Square location will be packed up and moved out by the 31st.

The address of Marias Studio in Fairfield: 407 Oakwood Drive. Feel free to contact Maria at 707.863.7370 or Maria@FiberElements.com. Maria will add more of her inventory to her existing online store at www.FiberElements.com.

Please note that Knitters Playground will continue online with whatever inventory is left after the sale and with the ability to special order for customers from select, understanding companies. Feel free to continue contacting Rebecca at knittersplayground@sbcglobal.net and continue to phone the Knitters Playground phone number  5307598816. Also, please check www.knittersplayground.com often, where you will soon be able to keep track of inventory, classes, knit nights, and yarn/tool needs.

Thank you all so much for your constant support, friendship, and fun & happy company.

Maria and I would like to continue knit nights, classes, workshops, and whatever services we may reasonably offer. We would love your input as to the most affordable and comfortable meeting locations. In any case, the sales will start immediately so please stop by and stock up! I will also be increasing the store hours to include Sundays during the month of October 
40%  at cost sale starts today for
Knitters Playground inventory;


And up to 35% off select Fiber Elements inventory


We will only be able to accept cash and checks for the weekends of Sept. 2730th as the CC machine will be at TKGA with Maria.
Please let me know if you are interested in purchasing any fixtures as well!
Thank you for making us part of your lives!
 Rebecca Detrick

20070209 21:03:55 nbsp I love Knitters Playground!!  The atmosphere is completely unpretentious, its a great place to go if you are having trouble with a project,  want to get some great yarn or knitting supplies, or if you just want to enjoy the company of other knitters!  The people here are super friendly and go above and beyond in helping you get what you need.  I have been to other knitting shops where the staff will be completely condescending if youre not the most expert knitter, but I always feel comfortable (and welcome!) here.  Now, if only they served tea and cookies, Id spend my whole day there :) RubyRoo

20070412 18:16:46 nbsp I second RubyRoo!  I, too, love Knitters Playground.  Their frices are very fair, Rebecca who owns and runs it is a gem, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.  I have never once felt selfconscious being in Knitters Playground, I always feel welcome, and for the first time in a nice knitting store (read: not Michaels crafts) I dont feel stupid asking questions.  Highly recommended spot for anyone in Davis seeking yarn, a pleasant atmosphere, or a little help.  Not to mention they have knitter nights and classes!! Users/NaomiYoffe
