Knitting may not be the cheapest of hobbies, but for those looking to Living Cheaply live cheap knitting can provide endless hours of entertainment for less initial monetary investment than something like Climbing rock climbing. Even better, while pursuing the hobby, one ends up with a surplus of gifts for their loved ones.

You can no longer buy much yarn in Davis, but knitting needles can still be found in town.

Some places in and around Davis to find knitting supplies and help:

  http://www.yarnyarnyarn.com/ Rumpelstiltskin is a yarn and textile craft store in Sacramento, which carries a comprehensive stock of yarns and tools for knitting, spinning and weaving as well as books and classes.
  http://www.babettasyarnandgifts.com/ Babettas Yarn and Gifts is in Fair Oaks and has lots of different fiber and weight yarn. She also has a stamp card that gets you a discount when it is full.
  UCD Bookstore seems to periodically offer knitting needles and cheap yarn off and on throughout the year.
  Davis Food Coop sometimes has some organic yarn skeins and a few sets of knitting needles. It also hosts the Craft Circle which meets 46 pm on the first and third Sundays of every month in the conference room.
  The Artery Artists coop occasionally has handspun yarn from local breeders such as:
  http://www.meridianjacobs.com Meridian Jacobs in Dixon is run by a local artisan & supplier of Jacob sheeps wool & yarn
  http://www.fiberelements.com/Art.htm is a Fairfield source who was associated with the defunct Knitters Playground store
  The Yolo Knitters Guild is a group of local knitters, meet 2nd & 4th Thurs Noon2 pm at Lutheran Church 8th & B Sts Davis.
  Dollar Tree has some random Lion Brand noveltyish yarn come in occasionally, surprise, surprise. Not all the time, though.
  Yolo Hospice Thrift Store in Woodland  lots of cheap yarn
  SPCA Thrift Store in Davis sometimes gets knitting needles, crochet hooks and yarn in; its not guaranteed but worth a try  because its very cheap! Dont expect top notch yarn, but if you score some knitting needles here at a price next to nothing, you can spend the money you saved on nicer yarn from one of these other places.

  WalMart has a decent craft section
  wiki:Woodland:JoAnn Fabric in Woodland and http://www.michaels.com/ Michaels in Vacaville have great yarn selections as well as guidance for teaching yourself. Michaels offers occasional classes on knitting for a small fee. A new store in Woodland called Knitting Pretty has just opened up.

  http://www.winddancerranch.us Wind Dancer Ranch has naturally colored NavajoChurro yarn for knitters and wool for handspinning.  Local farm in the Capay Valley.
  The Paint Chip is offering cotton and worsted yarn (about 2 skeins per color) seen as of December 2011. No needles though.

The Craft Center offers a beginning (and sometimes continuing as well) knitting and crochet classes, as well as a few classes on quickie knitting and cable techniques. Class schedules and cost can be found http://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/crafts/schedules.php here. The cost of the beginning knitting class includes knitting needles and yarn.

The Davis Adult School offers an Monday evening knitting class for $45. The class meets at the new Korematsu Elementary School in Mace Ranch. The teacher provides supplies for inclass instruction, but everyone goes out and selects the yarn and needles they want to use.

Several community knitters have a knitting group that meets every Monday night from 69 at varying locations across Davis. A calendar of locations can be found on their page, Davis Knit Night. Theyre super friendly, and always welcome more. Also, there are several current and past shop owners that will bring yarn and needles if you need to purchase anything on Monday nights, as well as help with any knitting problems.

Departed Businesses

  wiki:Woodland:Knittin Pretty Yarn Shop carried supplies for all needle crafts including knitting, crochet, tatting, embroidery, felting, and rughooking.

 The Knitters Playground was a knitterfocused business downtown that closed in 2007.

20071128 13:24:00 nbsp Yes. Theres nowhere in this town to get yarn now. Argh. Must edit wiki... Users/JenniferRutherford

20080614 00:13:31 nbsp I had just learned to knit when most of the local stores closed down.  Bummer.  Users/BreeButler

20081227 19:35:42 nbsp I was at the farmers market this morning and there was a vendor selling yarn and fiber there. Users/EmilyH

20091202 17:24:00 nbsp Today I stumbled upon Knittin Pretty Yarn Shop in Woodland while I was waiting for City Smog to open after lunch. The owner, Annabelle Reynolds, is looking to sell her business sometime by August 2010 so that she can retire. Since Knitters Playground and In Sheeps Clothing recently closed, it would be a shame for another specialty yarn shop to close so soon. Is there anyone out there interested in owning a yarn store? In the mean time, she has stocked an excellent selection of gorgeous natural fiber yarns (alpaca, wool, merino, sugar cane viscose, bamboo, silks, etc) which I havent seen at JoAnn or Walmart. I definitely recommend Knittin Pretty for that special yarn, although it is less expensive to go to Walmart for the cheap acrylics. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20091218 17:14:15 nbsp Just as a note for any area knitters who might be GLBT: I recently decided to learn to knit. I got a bunch of knitting stuff for the holidays from my partner and my friends, but I still need some things, including needles. I drove up to Woodland on my lunch break, intending to go to Knittin Pretty. Unfortunately, the store van parked outside had a number of bumper stickers, including a Yes on 8 one. I didnt think Id feel comfortable shopping there, so I kept driving. Users/nmwallace
