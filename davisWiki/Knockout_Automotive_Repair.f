20061017 16:46:19 nbsp Once I came and asked to check coolant leakage. But mechanic told me that he cant find any. Then I went to University Autorepair  and they found a leak and fixed it. Now car working fine. I returned to first mechanic and asked to returne me money back  but he told me no. I tryed to speak to owner  but mechanic alway tell story like come tommorow he will be here. I came couple of time and after that I told that I will go to judge  only after that he afraid. But he returne me only half because he write on check that he found oil leak, even I didnt ask him to find that one. So   dont go to that auto repair shop!!! The mechanic isnt honest, and he dont know his work well. ArtZy

20070821 13:52:56 nbsp I was sold a $60 coupon by these people that had free services: oil change, A/C check, radiator flush etc...I needed some work done recently and tried calling to schedule an appointment and the number has been disconnected…I drove by a few times the garage is closed with no signs or return time up. This is a very shady situationI’m guessing the guy skipped town. Users/Davisguy

20071224 11:05:32 nbsp The mechanic was rude, and got irritated when I kept coming back to tell him that he hadnt fixed the problem.  He had replaced a part with another faulty part and refused to reimburse me for the repair, of which I only asked for the cost of the part.  Said hed call the manufacturer first for more information and would call me back the next day.  He did call, but at an insanely early hour.  He wouldnt return any calls after that.  If this place is still open, stay away. Users/WakeForest
