A group of local Davis DJs that do various events around the Northern California area.  The DJs are anywhere from Chemistry Ph.D candidates to undergraduates to people that are not affiliated with the University at all.  If you are curious about some of the nonKDVS Davis music scene, you can check our their http://www.djak.org/djbios.html webpage.  Small intimate house parties with this group happen about twice a month.  However, be sure you bring vinyl if you want to come cause its all about the music.
