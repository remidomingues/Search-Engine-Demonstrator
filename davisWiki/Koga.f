20121208 17:14:57 nbsp Koga has been cutting my hair for over a year and I wouldnt go to anyone else! I went in today to get a hair cut and it turned out great! Plus when she was washing my hair the head massage was so good that I fell asleep. I would recommend Koga to anyone especially if youre looking for a cool edgy cut! Users/JR
