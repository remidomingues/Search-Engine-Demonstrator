Koinonia Christian Fellowship @ Davis is a Student Organizations student Christian Spiritual Organizations fellowship at UC Davis that shares in Gods love through studying and applying the many relevant truths of the Bible.  We foster a friendly environment where those who have questions about Christianity can find answers, and those who are already Christians can grow in their faith.  In case youre wondering, Koinonia means fellowship in Greek.

During the academic year we either meet by large groups on the UC Davis campus or by smaller life groups. During the summer please check the website for up to date information.

From the website:
Well, Koinonia is a greek word for fellowship. That’s what we’re all about: fellowship with God, and fellowship with each other. We are a Christian college fellowship group at UC Davis, we “do” life together, learn more about ourselves, and figure out how God fits into all of this!

College is a fun and exciting time to build lifelong friendships and to start thinking about life. We hope that you will check out Koinonia and join us as we journey through life together.

Koinonia is affiliated with Gracepoint.


20121004 14:54:31 nbsp Came to Koinonia since my undergrad years – I was a junior transfer, and coming into the university as a Junior was quite overwhelming. I went to church a few times before but knew very little about God, Jesus, church. Here at Koinonia, I learned more through the engaging talks, courses they offer and studying the Bible…I got a chance to investigate, asked a lot of questions and got good answers about what Bible has to say. I was drawn to the warmth and the sincere Christians at Koinonia who really tried to live out what the Bible teaches. Not only that I found God and many answers to my life questions, I found a loving community and lifelong friends! My college years wouldn’t have been this meaningful if it weren’t for being part of Koinonia! Users/BoChen

20121004 15:05:13 nbsp If I had to pick one word to describe Koinonia, it would be family. I really appreciate the attention, care, and concern people show. You never feel alone! And I love the fact that I can just be myself. No pretending to be someone youre not here (which gets so tiring anyway); imagine just sitting around a living room, sharing how your day went, eating ice cream, playing random games that make you laugh, and feeling like youre part of something bigger than yourself. Thats what Id rather do Friday night than partying or playing video games at home. And its all centered around the love of God, which people here genuinely show. You definitely have to give it a try at least once. Users/PhilChoi

20121005 10:13:45 nbsp Ever since my freshman year, Koinonia has been my home away from home.  I came to college with that old familiar nagging sense that there must be some true meaning to life, and I found it in God at Koinonia!  And I had such awesome time along the way  went on so many memorable trips to Yosemite, camping, hiking, big events like NSWN, small gatherings like dinners at older bros and sisters homes, moments of laughing my heart out to moments of tearful joy  my life has been so full ever since that time I walked into the first Bible study at Koinonia.  God is so good and life can be so abundant!  Users/KevinHan

20130613 09:06:03 nbsp Being a undergraduate in Koinonia Christian Fellowship as of this posting, I have to agree with everything that the staff has said about the fellowship. It really is a wonderful place of community where you can truly understand what it means to be a Christian. All the staff are so caring and willing to open up their homes to complete strangers, with the sole purpose of showing Gods love. I come from a church background, but I never really understood exactly what it meant to live a Christian life  to be a part of something that is bigger than myself. Also, just being able to drop my guard and share personal struggles with my peers, older brothers, and staff without fear of rejection or judgement has made being a part of this community so worthwhile. Koinonia is a wonderful community of Godcentered people, but also a place where you can have a lot of fun! Whether it comes in the form of playing sports or board games, roasting marshmallows and sausages around a fire, or going on a trip to Tahoe or Yosemite, Koinonia has continued to be a constant source of enjoyment for me since I first started coming out, back in 2011.

20130911 09:56:43 nbsp Many people have been hurt by the practices of Gracepoint, Koinonia and their leaders. I’m writing this because I was hurt for many years, both while I was a member and after I left. That part of my story is not unique to myself, many former members have similar experiences. I genuinely hope what I write can help anyone who is currently attending or is a former member or even thinking about going.

They may do some good things, especially to outsiders looking in. So maybe I shouldn’t just make a blanket statement like, don’t go to this church. Rather, I think this is the church for you if:

 You don’t believe in confidentiality. All the information you write on your reflection sheets are circulated and systematically shared in staff meetings. Keep in mind there is a lot of soft pressure to be as honest and forthcoming as you can on these. Anything you tell your leader gets reported back up the chain so the upper staff knows what you are “struggling with.” Former staff members have confirmed that they had “quotas” to meet in terms of how much they share about their ‘sheep.’
 You have too much time on your hands. Or if you’ve ever sat down and thought, you know, I should be spending every waking free moment of every day doing some kind of church activity. And I’d really like someone to be looking over my shoulder and get on my case if I don’t.
 If you truly believe God wants you to be subservient to a church leadership structure, even at the cost of your own mental health. I’m not exaggerating, there are people who left this church that had to seek psychiatric care and medications.
 If you’ve ever thought, “Choosing a spouse is hard. Wouldn’t it be easier if there was a committee of church leaders to pick my spouse for me? I’d like it to be a surprise as to who, when and where they decide, without regard to my opinion on who it is. I don’t care if we have any shared interests, personality traits, mutual attraction or compatability, what our families think of each other, etc. After I meet him/her, I’d like to go through an expedited dating process of about a month, and let the leadership make most of the major decisions in regards to when and how our wedding will go.”

Unless of course, the leadership overlooks or forgets about you and/or decide you are not “spiritually ready” to be married. Be ready to be single a long time. Cause you should never make a decision like when or who to date on your own. I can’t make this stuff up, I seriously believe this church on it’s way to starting a monastery or just flat out making arranged marriages.

It really all starts off harmlessly enough by having a no dating in college policy and strictly platonic, usually supervised relationships with the other gender only policies. This evolves over time into You are not ready to date and having to meet subjective opinions of the staff as to when you are ready, rather than your own personal convictions and what you feel God is telling you. Eventually, if you stay at the church long enough, they really do try to do something close to an arranged marriage, although they never call it that.

 You are ready to sacrifice your career, education, grades and interests if they are perceived to come into conflict with serving the church’s’ interests. I quite literally almost failed out of school due to this churchs practices and pressure to attend church activities.
 If you think sleeping is for wussies. I got rebuked several times for sleeping too much. I didn’t even know that was possible I thought when you are hungry, your body is saying you need food. When you are thirsty, your body is telling you to drink something. When you desire love, something like love must exist. But if you feel tired and sleepy, it’s cause you’re a selfish lazy bum that needs rebuking. These rebukes weren’t very consistent either. Later I was rebuked for not being enthusiastic enough at church activities, probably because I wasn’t sleeping enough.
 You firmly believe that leaving a church or changing your opinion over time as you grow up is a Cardinal sin. Pay attention to how they talk about former members most if not all of them were too prideful, too angry, too selfish, too . They don’t make it easy to leave, and once you do, it’s a full on character assassination blitz.

When I was a freshman, one of the staff told me, and Im paraphrasing,  is a religion based on fear. Christianity is a religion based on love. Looking back, this seems ironic. When I was there, I remember being afraid a lot. Afraid of being rebuked, of being reported on to the leaders about something, about when or if I would be ready to date in their eyes, if I would have to drop out of school to keep up with all the church activities. In conclusion, I’ve come to terms that in their minds, I will always be in the wrong, because I have challenged the infallible wisdom of the leadership of this church. Users/jonwoo
