Konditorei is an Austrian Pastry Restaurants Cafe. They bake and sell Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods pastries and danishes (including tasty filled croissants), traditional Austrian desserts, coffee cake, sweet Austrian breads, and cookies. For breakfast they have breakfast pizza, spinach quiche, and a croissant breakfast sandwich. For lunch they serve quiche, calzones, pizza, and soup. Konditorei is one of the only places in Davis (aside from Zias Delicatessen, Bistro 33 and Icekrimski Cafe) to find Gelato, which is Italianstyle ice cream. If you have ever been to Italy and tried Gelato there, it is even better quality here. This place is popular with affluent 30something age women (think tea society) during lunch time, and elderly folk at breakfast time. Priced for the uppermiddle classexpect to pay about $3 for a pastry item, and $4.50 for a slice of cake.

They also have free WiFi, just ask for the WEP code from the employees.

Konditorei is German for pastry shop.  A Bäckerei is a bakery where one would find standard breads and rolls.

Three of their cakes, the Carina, Nina, and Layla, are named after the Kutternigs children, while the Gloria cake
named after Gloria Kutternig.  Albert Kutternig, who had culinary training in Austria, is the pastry shop chef.



20060828 12:58:42 nbsp Their pastries are to die for, make sure you come in early, a lot of their good stuff (although all their stuff is good stuff) is gone by the afternoon. Some of the best crispy, flakey, pefectly sweet pastries Ive ever had, even compared to other nice pastry shops found in larger cities.  Users/TheodoreSuryapurnama

20070505 17:49:42 nbsp Their pastries compare very well to those found in Austria (which makes sense, considering the origin and training of the owner!)

I would recommend to anyone with a craving for an authentic and absolutely delicious treat. Users/KevinGong

20070624 19:02:55 nbsp my family of five once spent $50 here just on desserts.  pricey, but sometimes you want a posher alternative to safeway junk. Users/CandiceWang

20070728 20:32:38 nbsp Great pastries!! I love their filled croissants, sweet breads, and fruit pastries. Their baked goods are the best in Davis but I have to say that Ciocolat has much, much better truffles. We ordered truffles here for our wedding and most of the guests could not stomach them. In the end we actually threw away 2030 truffles because no one wanted them. Needless to say, stick with what is always fabulous here: the baked goods! Users/GradStudent06

20070729 12:43:31 nbsp Konditorei is among the places you can go to see townies in their natural environment. As with many townie hangouts, you can live in Davis for several years without even knowing about Konditorei. Frankly, thats part of its charm. I especially recommend their patio for oldfashioned coffee talk with friends. Cool even on the hottest days. Users/JoRo

20070826 15:41:33 nbsp <smacks lips> Their Gelato is like heaven.  The only thing I dont like about this place?  I have to walk or ride by it on my way to and from the gym.  SO HARD TO RESIST!!! Users/ElisaWeller

20070827 11:55:32 nbsp How does this compare to Ciocolat?  Users/SandyRose

20070925 20:56:20 nbsp I liked this place over Ciocolat.  Ciocolat desserts are all mouses and chocolate.  Im much more about cakes and ice cream.  In fact, having been all over Europe, my favorite cafes (and best cakes Ive ever had) were in Vienna.  Although Konditoreis cakes are a bit on the heavy sugar side, I can honestly say, they have the best cakes in Davis (so far). Users/atwong

20071106 14:29:55 nbsp Evidently, the kitchen likes to close early. My husband and I were in at 12:30 on Sunday, but we could not order any food as the kitchen was closed. We left, and so did another couple.  Users/Shelly

20071111 20:25:15 nbsp The place does close at 1PM on Sundays and some of the workers like to clean up a little early, especially when the place is quiet. Im sure if you ask the person in the front if they still made pizzas, Gloria (she works in the back) will make them, especially if she knows there is more than one of you who wants it.  Users/Mae

20071111 20:30:30 nbsp They serve the best gelato by far.  A great amount for what you pay, unlike most of the places downtown.  Served in a nice large, decorative glass.  If only it wasnt way down 5th.  Users/EdWins

20071202 20:11:52 nbsp I absolutely love zusy! Shes very nice.  I went there this Saturday and have some wonderful pastries! I especially like the chocolate croissant! Though it may be a little pricy, I think a little slice of heaven is good now and then. Users/CalvinCheng

20071218 23:52:37 nbsp What a lovely place to have a genteel breakfast or lunch (especially on the nice covered patio outside), or skip the meal and go straight to the dessert.  Its what they do best in any case, though I do like the quiche  skip the turkey sandwich.  For those of you who have only had the Americanized version of a croissant or a danish, you simply have to find out a proper flaky pastry tastes like.  Its a whole nother creature.  But be warned that walking into this café is to be bombarded with one delicacy after another; how to choose when one thing looks better than the next?  Take heart, though, one can always return, or splurge on a cake for a special event.  Too bad their hours are so few and their location only really convenient for East Davisites. Users/CovertProfessor

20080213 15:04:19 nbsp Their pastries and food are excellent, and if youre planning a wedding, the owner does amazing work with Marzipan and sugarglass.  My wife and I still have the sugarglass dragon he sculpted for the top of our wedding cake from nearly two years ago  we got a display case for it because we like it so much.  Users/BrianWilliams

20080220 18:49:54 nbsp I like this place for many things.  However, I made the mistake of ordering a Verdi Pizza. Do NOT go there for the pizza!! (duh) It came out looking like a tiny microwave pizza (thick nondescript cheese and crust) and ALL the vegetables were CANNED.  Disgusting.  The asparagus, the olives, the jalapeno, the artichokes (marinated  maybe they were from a JAR, I dont know). It was salty as hell and just plain insulting. I was very upset because I stupidly spent $8 on this thing.  Im sorry, but if you are going to charge $8 for a tiny pizza, the least you can do is put some effort into it! What a complete waste of $8.  (If you want cheaper and high quality pizza, Village Bakery has the best in Davis). I also once had a soup there that had the texture of and tasted like Lipton soup powder mix. Supposedly it was a cream of asparagus soup. Anyway, getting a pizza full of canned vegetables really pissed me off for some reason.  My advice: just stick with the pastries and gelato!  Users/Lucille

20080513 16:56:07 nbsp everyone should try their fabulous mocha smoothies.  :) Users/PilarFloyd

20080514 18:52:04 nbsp Pastries are great, the chocolate croissant is a must try (if you get there early enough). Their cakes have a lot of mousse compared to the actual cake, but always moist and just sweet enough, compared to Ciocolat, where their cake can be quite dry (especially if you go at the end of the day). Users/youkai

20080810 22:11:05 nbsp i love this place! the kuttiger family is very hospitable! good food and good hospitality Users/davisrox

20080926 09:26:58 nbsp Absolutely delicious  I went to undergraduate school in Davis in 2000 to 2004, and never even knew Konditorei existed! I recently came back to Davis to go to graduate school and I happened to move into Greystone Apts, almost right across the street from Konditorei. I wanted coffee one morning and was running late on my way to work, so I stopped in and picked up a Cafee Au Lait, and was so impressed, I went back after work to sample some of their pastries. To die for, in a cliche phrase. Like other users though, I do recommend staying away from the pizzas if youve never had a EUROPEAN pizza before, because like the pastries themselves, they are NOT Americanized, and therefore taste differently (Ever had REAL Chinese food, i.e, from Beijing?) from what youre used to.  Users/Aggieanthony

20081105 21:08:30 nbsp Priced for the uppermiddle class—expect to pay about $3 for a pastry item, and $4.50 for a slice of cake.

HAHAHAHAHA, obviously whoever wrote this never bought a quality slice of cake before. I pay 620 yen ($6.20) for a slice of chestnut cake at my local cake shop here in Kyoto, and thats pretty cheap. And thats not a omg Japan is expensive thing either. Users/KellyCorcoran

20081107 22:58:42 nbsp Great food and atmosphere  feels very much like Europe. Would recommend any day for a moderate breakfast or afternoon snack and tea. Users/Xenophon

20081110 23:00:41 nbsp I was thoroughly unimpressed with Konditorei. I have eaten lunch there a number of times and I find it highly overpriced, considering the portion sizes and the quality of food. Their tortes are rather uninteresting, I would rather go to Ciocolat for a slice. Their cookies are slightly better (I particularly like the Linzer...I believe that is what it is called...), sometimes I go to get a cookie sampler for my coworkers or myself...but the prices are hard to swallow. Overall, I probably wont be dining in at Konditorei since my friend (a diehard Kondotoreinian) graduated. Aree rating: 6/10 (I would give it a 5 if not for the cookies).  Users/ArianeMetz

20081224 09:52:55 nbsp One of the best places in town to just sit, eat and enjoy your partners company.  The staff is friendly.  The food is great, especially for the price. My wife and I can get filled up for about $20 (2 pastries, breakfast pizza, soup of the day, green tea), not to bad for quality food.  I have yet to try a danish/pastry I didnt like there, (but my favorite is the quark cheese strudle or rice strudle w/ vanilla cream sauce), so Id recommend just about everything.  The soup of the days are always good. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20090408 17:44:31 nbsp Konditoreis desserts are the BEST in Davis. They are delicious!!!!! The cafe is clean and quite. I like to go there for breakfast on my days off.
If you are deciding where to buy birthday cakes,I highly recommend you to go there.
Believe me, their cakes are PRETTY and delicious!!  Users/kikokiko

20090427 21:23:22 nbsp SO EXCITED TO FIND ALMOND CRIOSSANTS IN DAVIS! They are sooooo yummy here, too. I actually liked it better than La Bous. Its also fun just to look around at their beautiful cakes and pies. They are so fresh and bright! Users/BrookeB

20090621 02:38:26 nbsp This is a gem in Davis! Love the crepe with the berries and gelato. Try thisa scoop of hazelnut gelato inside a stronger coffee like columbiansluping the gelato yum!! Better than any frappochino or what not youll ever have.  Users/val

20090817 13:48:48 nbsp Very delicious deserts.  Gloria always hooks me up with some free pastries.  Highly recommended.   Users/BenLee

20091117 12:54:22 nbsp The best drink Ive ever had anywhere was their mocha smoothie...before they changed the recipe. Luckily my girlfriend spied the mix at one point so she can order it for herself :) Users/GreatRyan

20100125 16:59:06 nbsp This is a real Austrian cake shop. They do not sell bread. It makes me glad that I live in such a rich expensive city that I get a place like this. Users/dizzyditz

20100129 22:46:49 nbsp Best espresso and pastires in Davis hands down.  Every pastry that Ive had has been incredible and everyone that Ive talked to has loved the place. They have a very pleasant little patio with outdoor seating. Also their croissant breakfast sandwich is huge if your hungry for more than a pastry!  Havent tried the lunch... Users/5thAve

20100219 16:05:02 nbsp I have always enjoyed Kondorei. It is a treasure. The lunches are great but a small selection. The coffees and pastries are  amazing! Oh by the way Dizzyditz, sometimes they do sell bread and it is wonderful as well. Users/ashleyinthemist

20100304 12:57:06 nbsp okay . . . So I heard about this place and decided to get a cake for my friends birthday. i havent tried the cake yet, but while we were deciding on which cake, the line became long. We finally decided on a cake and lined up. it took about 15 minutes before they got our order, but we didnt mind the wait, my friend and I were chatting. when I ordered my chocolate orange cake, I wanted them to write happy birthday but they could not do it. the girl at the counter told me they were understaffed(obviously), and they could charge me an extra 4 dollars by putting blocks of happy birthday on there(without my friends name).

The cake was amazing, just make sure you call ahead of time to have them write happy birthday if you need to  )

20100529 16:22:35 nbsp LOVE this place! croissants are to die for! Users/KristinAdams

20100710 14:20:19 nbsp this place is outrageously good. every pastry ive tried is deeply satisfying in that its delicious as well as artistic. their iced coffee is the best ive ever had, no cream or sugar. all this and theres service with a smile :D Users/ketan

20100716 17:19:40 nbsp The best pastries ever in the whole world. The raspberry chocolate cake is delish. Users/JasperD

20110405 15:57:11 nbsp I dont think anyone could claim that Konditorei has anything but absolutely delicious food.  Though its true that some of the cakes are frozen before doing final preparations for customers, Ive never tried one that didnt taste fresh.  Everything is unique, meticulously served, and freshly prepared.  The prices are steep, but the owners use only real, highquality ingredients.  That being said....

I refuse to take partake anymore in supporting their business.  I used to work for Albert and Gloria, and at the time those months were the most stressful and hurtful in my life.  The 4 other employees (who werent the owners daughters) and I were subject to constant criticism and abuse.  All of my coworkers were hardworking, honest, and capable, but it seemed that every day nobody could do anything correctly, and nobody earned genuine respect.  Out of those 4 who were there when I started, all of them left the job within months  perhaps youve noticed the extremely high employee turnover rate.  Dont get me wrong, constructive criticism is necessary and welcome in a boss/employee relationship, but being blamed for errors that we didnt do, working extended (8+ hour) shifts without breaks on busy days, being unable to speak up for ourselves freely, and hurtful attacks on our personalities were a constant source of pressure while working for Albert and Gloria Kutternig.  To be fair, there were aspects of working there that I thoroughly enjoyed, but as a whole, I felt like none of the hard work, initiative, and care that I put into the multiple months of my employment there was acknowledged or noticed.  I respect their business, and I thoroughly enjoyed their food, but I think their treatment of their employees is deplorable and should be addressed.  If you support their business or plan on doing so in the future, all I can hope is that you keep this in mind. Users/LilyRosamond

20110413 12:56:53 nbsp OMG Lilyrosamond i felt the same way. i also worked for albert and gloria kutternig ( the other girls and i called them kutterNUTS)they were the worst people i have ever worked for. i didnt realize all the mental and verbal abuse i got from them until after i left. they were bipolar. sometimes they would be happy and sometimes they would be grumpy. when theyre are grumpy you dont want to be around them but if you are you have to suck up or else they will snap at you for little or even no reason. i was always scared coming into work. i did not hate work because the food is good (but overpriced) and the coworkers/customers were nice. they dont know how to treat their employees properly. it was annoying seeing them so nice to the customers then turn around and snap at you. after i got a new job i realize that working there was freakin hell. try to avoid working here or else youll be sorry. yeah the food is good just not worth the abuse. never been back since Users/anonymousaggie

20110426 16:14:57 nbsp Crazy!

I just read the last two posts and had a throwback!  I have to comment:

I lasted THREE (3) DAYS as an employee here. Literally. (This was a few years ago, and I was an inexperienced baby, but still, I knew something was a muck).  Reading your posts made me feel lucky to have trusted my gut to QUIT on day three.  I got a weird vibe the first time I was hired when they mentioned that they liked hiring europeanlooking females... right away I wanted out.

Day 1 wasnt so bad, I was just getting acquainted with the pastries and trying to learn their weird names....

On Day 2 of the job, I was scolded for not cutting the tomatoes thin enough. And Im not talking Oh lets try and cut them a little thinner Im talking SCOLDED.  I was almost brought to tears.

By Day 3, I was yelled at for not being able to perfect the fancy designs in the foam of the lattes (keep in mind, I have had NO experience in ANY of this... had never even made my own pot of coffee before). WHATTT!?  I remember it was my first time using a cash register, EVER, and she said I was not allowed to use it for calculating purposes... in other words, she FORCED me to do all of the cash exchange using JUST my brain no pen paper, nothing and I had to do it FAST!  If I was not handing them their change fast enough, I got yelled at. Psycho, right???  I quit that afternoon and she literally THREW my earnings in my face and told me to GET OUT! YOU WASTED MY TIME!

Im all about delicious sweets and yummy pastries, but I do NOT support a business who treat their employees like slaves... So, I do not recommend this business.     Users/NikiRose

  Ive never worked at Konditorei or in fact at any retail establishment, so I wouldnt know about these employment issues.  Even so, this criticism of the establishment, while it may have some truth to it, seems over the top.  Its just basic common sense that if youre not supposed to use the cash register for arithmetic (which may make sense if they are worried about keeping track of money), and you dont like doing arithmetic in your head, you COULD bring your own calculator.  Even your phone probably has one.  Also, if you had a falling out with them, then it may be wise to get a different job, but outright confrontations generally have two sides to them; people dont usually throw things for no reason. Users/GregKuperberg


20110505 13:56:49 nbsp I worked at Konditorei once a few years ago. although they did expect a lot from me, I proved myself as a worthy worker and I earned their respect and trust and kindness. I ended up working there for a year and three months. the entire Kutternig family was very welcoming to me. because it is a family business, its like being in their home, you definitely feel the family vibes and you work in a family environment. the daughters were very warm, made me feel comfortable at work even on tough days. while I worked there, I did see girls come and go through quick employments, but those were the girls that just werent willing to adjust, or in a more sensible statement; the girls who listened to their bosses and did what they were told, were the ones who came through. on my shifts, I was told that I was able to eat whatever I please and sit down whenever there was time, so I counted that as enough of a break. to me, it was a pretty fair and reasonable job, they never asked too much of me. everything I was requested to do wasnt impossible, and as for the cash register that doesnt count back the change for you, Im pretty sure we all know basic math, and thats truly all it is. and in fact, one of my friends works there now, and shes been there for over a year, and she loves it. holding a job there is possible, you just have to be willing to give it your all. and Im pretty sure thats the standard of any job owned by people who take their business seriously. I love Konditorei as a pastry shop, and I loved it as a job. Users/SarahReneeJohnson

20110730 12:29:06 nbsp I absolutely love this place. I am moving away from Davis and am sad that I wont get to enjoy their pastries, cookies, and meals anymore. I have been a frequent over the last five years and I have to say that Ive enjoyed everything I have had here. LOVE the cookies that come with their sandwiches. The mayor bread is fantastic, just wish it was available more often. Users/KalaPeka

20110730 12:31:17 nbsp Im not sure why old employees are ranting on the employment in this place... Davis Wiki isnt exactly used for those searching for jobs but rather a good bite to eat. Users/KalaPeka
  People use the Davis Wiki for all sorts of things, and I have definitely seen people using it to look for jobs or to fill jobs.  See, e.g., the employment page.  But to answer you more directly, some may choose not to go to a restaurant if they dont like the way the employees are treated, as a matter of principle.  I say this as someone who likes Konditoreis food and who doesnt know anything about its treatment of its employees.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110923 14:22:10 nbsp While I could quibble about Konditoreis location, prices, hours, and somewhat cold ambiance, I have to admit that they make the best pastries in Davis (or in Sacramento for that matter). They serve totally authentic Austrian food and pastries. And while their singleperson pizzas are not what youd get at an American pizzeria, they are exactly what youd get in Austria or Germany and I think they are very, very good. Highly recommended (but come early if you want to ensure that they will not have sold out of your favorites). Users/ToNils

20120127 13:54:32 nbsp Best cakes and pastries ever. Their Mediterranean pizza is also really good.  Users/RoamingDavisite

20120214 14:25:37 nbsp Chocolate Nougat is my favorite but the Gloria Mousse is delicious too.   Users/BingL

20120227 07:28:15 nbsp I adore this place its ambiance and pastries, and will continue to make guilty trips to buy that sinful croissant every now and then...!  One thing I do want to mention, though, is that I wish the pastries were MORE FRESH MORE OFTEN.  Bought 2 mango croissants yesterday, and they were not...I know its a family business and may be difficult to keep up on this sort of thing, but to the owners of Konditorei: you REALLY need to develop a system or something that tracks your freshness.  For me, your pastries are easily the BEST in Davis, but it is a letdown to your customers when they come and purchase an item that is not fresh.  For me, a more than occasional customer, this happens about 3050 percent of the time. So amazing business, but I certainly would be coming even MORE often, especially for birthday cakes if I knew the freshness were more guaranteed. Thanks for reading! Users/katietakara

20120405 17:31:34 nbsp This is an absolutely charming place with great pastries, serious chocolates, fabulous birthday cakes, and an allaround nice atmosphere.  It is authentically European  and not just any old European thing, but traditional, takeiteasy European.  (That was why they moved away from downtown, to help create a relaxed environment.)  The cakes are truly sophisticated, the best in town.  I like Ciocolat too, nothing against Ciocolat, but I like Konditorei better.  As for the pizza, well it is not their high expertise, but the pizzas are still interesting and good enough for me.  After 20 years here, Konditorei is Davis. Users/GregKuperberg

2012042221:31:15 nbsp I finally went here for the first time and was...actually rather disappointed. We didnt have pastries (not that I am a massive pastry person other than croissants, but we got there late enough that there wasnt much left anyway. But the folks I was with were driving in from out of town and run late, what can you do), and found that the breakfast cakesmarble and poppy seedwere absolutely tasteless. No flavor whatsoever, shockingly so. I liked the chocolate orange cake, but Id say the orange is what made the flavoring on that one. The chocolate, not so much. One of the folks out with me wasnt overly thrilled with his breakfast sandwichs lack of flavor either. The rest of us had breakfast pizza, which was pizza bread with egg, sausage, bacon, etc. just...plunked on there. Odd way to do a pizza. Well, it was tasty enough and I did like the pizza bread. I think Im just surprised for all the rave reviews Ive seen and heard that the cakes my party had were...flat. If I ever go here again, I guess Ill just stick to the breaded goods everyone raves about.Users/JenniferRutherford

20120822 10:01:46 nbsp In my very humble opinion they make THE best espresso in town.  Dark rich flavor thats never bitter, thick crema head that doesnt dissolve quickly, and a respectable portion.  Not a watered down version of a healthy portion; nope, an honesttogoodness full shot.  Or two if thats your inclination.

I cant speak to the quality of their lattes, mochas, etc., as I dont drink those particular concoctions.  I prefer straight espresso, so sugar no cream.    Users/browneyedblues

20121017 11:05:14 nbsp Ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a pumpkin latte. Croissant was very good, far better than any other options in Davis or Sacramento for that matter. Ordered another before I left to eat as a snack later because it was so good! Latte was so so, didnt detect any hint of pumpkin but wasnt bad either. Quaint on the inside, in kind of a weird location but worth the drive (or bike). The credit card minimum was kind of annoying, I think it was $6 minimum but just a pastry is about $3.00 so if you forget cash youre forced to order something else, hence the latte in my situation. Cool place with interesting history, highly recommend for breakfast pastries! Users/cj2012aggie

20121121 09:15:42 nbsp Regardless of how good their food and pastries are, i would never come back.  My receny visit was gross.  There was a mouse inside of their dining area.  The owners are rude to their employess by calling them stupid and thieves.  A friend of mine used to work there and Gloria talks about all the guests that come in and works all her employees to the bone.  Their daughters dont help for anything while everyone else slaves to make their business prosper.  Sounds like hyprocites to me.   Users/Samanthawong

20130823 17:08:20 nbsp Often come here to try new pastries, which are authentically austrian recipes. Their breakfast options are also very good. Their gelato was unfortunately not as authentic as you would find in an italian gelateria, but that is not their specialty. The austrian pastries are, and those are worth the visit. Users/ManuelCalderonDeLaBarca
