More religious Judaism Jews stick to a series of strict dietary laws. These kosher laws include: not mixing dairy and meat (e.g. no cheeseburgers), only eating land animals that chew their cud and have cloven hooves (e.g. no pork), not eating scavengers (e.g. no vultures), only eating meat that has been washed in a salt bath and has had all traces of blood removed, and only eating sea creatures with both fins and scales (e.g. no shellfish or bottom feeders).

Limited supplies of Kosher foods can be bought at Davis Supermarkets, but people with cars can benefit from the larger selection at Bobs Butcher Block & Kosher Deli in Sacramento.  Foods that are kosher can often be identified by a symbol on the packaging usually consisting of a U inside an O OU or a K in a triangle or star.

In 2006, the satirical ASUCD Jewish Slate included making the CoHo Kosher as part of its platform.
