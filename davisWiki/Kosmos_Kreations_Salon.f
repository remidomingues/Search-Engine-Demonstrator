20050926 17:05:14 nbsp The guy did a really good job on my hair pretty quickly and even gave me tips on how to take care of it.  Theyll give you the card rather than wait for you to ask for it, unlike the folks at Noodle City.  This is the place to go for a fashionable do at a studentfriendly price! Users/JennaChan

20051005 nbsp My regular hair cutter was busy, so I gave this place a try. Id definitely recommend. The woman was very meticulous in her trimming, and even explained to me why my hair needed to be shaped a certain way in the back. Users/TomHinds

20051028 13:33:02 nbsp I was also satisfied with my recent haircut. The woman did indeed spend more time and effort than normal on my hair. Users/JackHaskel

20051111 22:47:52 nbsp This place is great. The man cut my hair and did a fantastic job. The really will do whatever you want. Some guy came in ahead of me and gave the man a picture. The kid didnt have enough hair for that hair style, so the man that cuts the hair made up a new style to emulate that one on the spot. Users/GregHirson

20051111 23:21:22 nbsp Just a thought...but maybe for hair places it would be cool to show a before and after picture to see how great they came out! ) Users/KarlaFung

20051216 18:48:05 nbsp Just got back from there; great place, friendly people. Got in and out in less than 15min Users/JeremyWong

20060124 20:13:08 nbsp Best salon in town bar none. Best prices, speed and quality. Just be respectful and be sure to tip!  Users/RenoKing

20060214 15:01:33 nbsp I came in on a saturday morning to get a perm and it washed out by tuesday. The guy seemed really inattentive, trying to get in as many haircuts as possible while my perm was devlopping so he probably did a crappy job. I would NOT come here for a perm again. I was watching them do haircuts, I would trust them with short hair, but maybe not longer hair. Users/ChristinaReginaldo

20060219 16:23:13 nbsp Does anyone know a place that will do dreads? Users/TobinJones

20060317 13:06:46 nbsp I was really psyched to get my hair done here after reading everyones comments on here, and my coworker also hyped this place up.  They highlighted and cut my hair for only $50 and the highlighting turned out great but the guy cut my hair TOO short. I dont speak Chinese and he can barely speak English so he probably didnt understand.  Also I told him to leave my bangs alone but he did something w/ them anyway and now I look like some Japanese popstar lol. Overall it was OK, I miss my long hair and my straight bangs.. I guess only time will fix this.  Good prices but I wish I went to Supercuts or Great Clips instead.  Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060317 13:08:41 nbsp Oh, in response to Christinas comment on here, I totally agree. Maybe theyre good w/ short hair cuts (like w/ guys) but I will never come here again for a haircut. And when my hair was developing (during highlighting) the guy seemed like he forgot about me while he was cutting others hair. Users/KrystalVillanueva

20060428 19:39:50 nbsp I got my hair trimmed/cut here and they did a great job and for a great price, $12.  The woman even showed me how Supercuts botched my last trim since I had this one extra long chunk of hair among a lot of shorter ones. Users/RohiniJasavala

20060510 13:19:30 nbsp This place is great! The people there are friendly and they definitely know what theyre doing. I walked in not knowing what cut to ask for but the guy knew exactly what cut would fit me. I am very satisfied with my haircut ) Users/GraceChang

20060516 22:33:52 nbsp The lady there does the best eyebrow arching I have ever had. And its only $8. I only go to her now. They are both very nice. I think there is only two of them working there, so if you are in a hurry its best to call them first. Users/AnnaNeilson

20060911 17:10:19 nbsp I went here a few times but I will no longer go back. Their razor gave me a burn a couple of times and they did nothing about it. Also, the place is VERY dirty! There is hair everywhere  in the drawers, on the ground, on the seats, in the combs. Dont go if you dont want lice! Its not worth the few bucks you save. I also agree that they cut your hair shorter than you want it. Users/BrianWallace

20061008 15:39:58 nbsp This place is a really great place to get your hair cut for an affordable price. I didnt get to see the lady, but i did get my hair done by the taiwanese guy and he did a fantastic job. highly recommend except that there was a pretty long line Users/JasonKong

20061014 22:19:37 nbsp Excellent haircut. It came to $10 exactly but I was happy to leave a $2 tip. Users/MattLow

20061118 08:35:12 nbsp Ok. If you are an Asian guy looking at this website because youve been bleeding through your ear trying to find a place to cut your hair, let me tell you, from one Asian guy to the next, this is the place. They will give you a Bay Area style haircut like you are used to. Trust me, Ive been to several places and suffered a few bad haircuts until I found this spot. Btw, its $10 so its comparable to Bay Area prices.  Users/VinhBoy

20061202 19:37:49 nbsp Theyre great!  Their salon doesnt look attractive, but they do a good job.  I went in for a perm and of course, they cut your hair before you get it permed.  The guy cut it and I liked it so much that I was thinking of just keeping that hair cut.  The perm was good.  I got a spiral perm despite the fact that I read Christina Reginaldos comment.  I think she washed it the day of, or the day after and everyone knows you cant wash a perm for at least 3 days after getting it done!  It turned out very good and I love it SO much.  I will definitely go there again and recommend others to as well.  Users/JanetLee

20061217 04:52:32 nbsp I have had my hair cut twice here, once by Connie and once by John. I was very pleased with both cuts. Walked in without an appointment on a Saturday and didnt have to wait long. If this couple had a swankierlooking salon they could get away with charging a lot more than they do, so I don t mind the utilitarian ambiance. (The Chinese pop music on the boom box was entertaining!) This place is a great alternative to Great Clips or Supercuts. Users/JaneSchaferKramer

20070106 15:32:07 nbsp Worst haircut ever.  I came in with a detailed picture of the style I wanted, but my haircut came out absolutely nothing like it.  They also used a razor blade for all of my layering, which ended up with a rough textured, not even layered hair. Users/LinaOkada

20070108 08:12:54 nbsp Worts hair cut experince, cut my son ear and did not tell me, they do not have 1st aid kit, they put a sanitator external use to my son ear after he was bleeding because I asked for something. They are fast, I will said they are rushing , they use razor blade for everything. The guy is impatient. Dirty people, they cut chinese style that is why they use the razor all the time. Users/VivianaBennun

20070124 18:34:57 nbsp Excellent place. I just got my haircut and it is definitely comparable to Bay Area haircuts, like someone else mentioned, and definitely the place to go if you are an Asian guy.  LOL at all these biased comments. chinese style barely speak english dirty I didnt speak chinese to them at all and I got my hair just the way I wanted. And Chinese places usually do have hair all over the place, thats just how it is. Users/DavisWikiUser

20070224 12:29:15 nbsp i have a question ... what language of chinese do they speak? i mean, all these comments say they speak chinese but theres more than one chinese language. do they speak mandarin or cantonese or another dialect of chinese? Users/ReneChan mandarin (but for clarity, they also speak english, of course).

20070311 14:27:19 nbsp i loved it! i came in for a highlight and lowlight, and the guy did a better job on my highlights than any high end salon i have ever been to. i did not get a cut, but i would definately recommend it for color! Users/ReginaGunn

20070312 19:08:29 nbsp The lady was really nice and I showed her a picture of what I wanted but she made alterations to it that she thought better fit my face and neck characteristics.  I didnt like the haircut initially but I went back the next day and she adjusted it to the length I wanted for free.  She was still a very talented hair stylist.   Users/BamCam

20070318 20:21:43 nbsp Great place to get a haircut. Very quick and efficient. Didnt wait too long. Will come again. By the way they speak both mandarin and cantonese. Users/BrandonToo

20070326 17:30:44 nbsp I thought while my hair cut was not great, it was quite good for such a low price and nice service Users/MattHh

20070327 20:50:28 nbsp i come back here every 2 months to get my haircut.  im not very picky so i dont know how good my haircuts really are.  however, i love the low cost and the fact that im able to support an independent business rather than freak great clips Users/DerekFung

20070329 14:52:18 nbsp As with the last guy, Im not very picky about my haircuts.  I get my hair cut here every once and a while, they do a decent job and the price is relatively low for Davis. Users/AjTavakoli

20070411 18:16:43 nbsp I went to this place today, because I figured having Asian hair, Id be best going to an Asian salon. They dont speak English very well, but since I went in there not having a clue what I wanted it didnt make a difference. I just pointed to a picture on the table and said I want it shorter. It turned out alright. That was the first time Id ever paid for a haircut. Also, how much do people usually tip? Is $3 ok? Users/AliceChoe

20070411 18:32:45 nbsp Oh yeah, and this is the best haircut Ive ever had. Users/AliceChoe

20070426 10:57:53 nbsp Great place for haircuts. Its good to have a place in town that offers Asian style haircuts at a cheap, affordable price. The owners may seem to be in a hurry but they do take their jobs seriously and always made sure that I was completely satisfied with the cut. I havent been to any other hair salon ever since Ive discovered this place. Users/Kat

20070429 11:29:45 nbsp Great haircutters, and one of the cheapest in Davis for guys, like 9.95 or something. Users/William.Peacock

20070502 16:43:08 nbsp Excellent haircut. No wait time. Cheap. I really reccomend. Users/MattTran

20070520 12:38:02 nbsp i went here just to get my bangs cut and they did a horrible, horrible job.  the guy razored my bangs to thin them out (which was something i did not ask for) so they came out choppy and waaay too short. i looked like a 10 year old who used regular scissors to cut their own bangs. it took three months to grow out and then have a professional at a REAL salon fix it (and these were just bangs, not even a full out haircut).  so disgusting. and then i found out after the fact that the salon i usually go to (pure beauty) cuts bangs for free with the same stylist you go to for a regular haircut, so i didnt even have to go through all that.  oh well.     Users/MikaOkamura

20070528 10:33:29 nbsp Got haircut here twice by the guy.  Not too bad.  What i liked was that it was speedy.  In and out in like 15 minutes, but im guessing that i got lucky and there were not that many people in there.  I bet the wait will be a lot longer if they were busy since theres usually only two people working. Users/PorkFoo><><

I get great haircuts here by the guy. Advice for the newbies: Look through the hairstyle guide books, point to it and talk about what you want. Dont think that your verbal directions will get you the cut of your desire. The place is full of hair, so if you need a neat looking place, try coming in the morning. Dont wait when there are more than 2 people in there, avoid busy hours for them, come back later so that they can spend time on you. Users/BettyHuang

20071022 22:14:18 nbsp I love this place!!  Its the best haircut Ive seriously ever had.  My boyfriend has always been getting haircuts here from a male barber, and hes always liked his haircuts, so I went to get one myself for the first time tonight.  I dont know what people are talking abouttheir English is fine.  I showed a female hair cutter some photos of similar haircuts that I found online and she asked me questions about them in order to find out more information about what I wanted.  She worked VERY METICULOUSLY and took excellent CARE in cutting my hair into the exact style I asked of her.

Before tonight, I didnt get a haircut for over a year, and my hair seems to grow really quickly, so it looked pretty haggard to begin with.  Thats why for all the hassle it took for her to cut and style my hair into something manageable and soft, I was surprised when she actually charged me very little cost, and thats another reason why Im writing such a positive review.  Ill definitely get haircuts from Kosmos Kreations from now on. Users/YS

20071023 00:25:53 nbsp After hearing good recommendations from a friend, i decided to check this place out. Contrary to what everyone else says about the workers here they treated me rather coldy, he made me seem like I was a inconvenience to him, even though they werent even busy. To cut a long story short, he gave me a horrible hair cut, chopping off 5 inches of my hair when I TOLD HIM to ONLY cut 2 inches, the cut was also very uneven. Needless to say, Im not coming back her again and I would not recommend girls with long hair to come here. Even though the price is cheap its not worth it unless youre a guy.   Users/Kphung

20071023 08:23:52 nbsp I went here on a Saturday morning not to long ago to get a haircut because of all the great things I heard. I got there just when they should have opened (according to the hours posted) but after waiting 10 minutes after, with no one showing up to open I left and went somewhere else... Users/MyaBrn

20071029 10:56:32 nbsp be careful. the girl replacing the guy does NOT know how to cut hair. the guy went on vacation and wont be back for another 2months or so. request the haircut from the skinny one with short hair. Users/headach3n

20071030 08:38:21 nbsp I like this place. If you dont have very high maintenance hair, then this is the place to go. I like the little short asian lady. I think her name is Connie. Shes very soft spoken and very patient. Her english isnt that good so you cant speak too fast to her. I notice that they recently seem to have different people there and I dont see that guy anymore. I havent tried any of the new people yet but I didnt like that asian guy. He was so rude and impatient. The first time I went was for color. He was messy and got it all over my ears. I was telling him and so he started to get pissy. Then Connie came over and took over. She was very nice and cleaned me up and my color came out great. It she didnt come over that day I think I wouldnt have given this place a 2nd, 3rd ... etc chance. Worthwile to go if you live in Davis. Users/JSakai

20071030 22:48:07 nbsp Hey does anyone have any input into their hiliting/coloring abilities? Specfically, I want some blond hi lites and low lites  is that something they can do well?  Users/Aggie2010

20071219 11:39:24 nbsp John no longer works there. Too bad because I liked the way he cut my hair the most. Does anyone know where he went? I know he was talking about a salon on 3rd St. or something. Anyways, Connie isnt too bad of a hair cutter. My friend seems to really like her. This is the only place I go to for a cut! Users/syang

20080106 02:04:54 nbsp The guy (John Lin) opened a new place in University Mall: New Fashion Salon Users/LauraShih

20080116 00:52:40 nbsp I love my new haircut by Connie!!! All my family and friends loved my new look!!! Plus plus, she did my eyebrows really well! Also, I do my skin care there every month, all my acne were healed and skin is getting better!  Thanks Connie! Users/Cici

20080330 18:00:46 nbsp I have been getting my haircuts at Kosmos Kreations for quite a while now. I always like the way John cut my hair. I went there today to find Connie and a couple other ladies working. One of these new ladies started working on my hair. It was soon apparant that she does not know how to cut hair at all. She is also incredibly slow. She took off most of my hair because she kept trying to straighten out her mistakes. After almost an HOUR, Connie took over and fixed my haircut as much as she could. My head now looks like an egg. I could have cut my hair the same way at home with a shaver, and it would have been much faster. I am never going there again. Next time, Im going to John at the UMall. BEWARE: As a consequence of getting a haircut from the new lady wearing glasses you may have to shave your head. Users/Kostya

20080421 21:36:19 nbsp I think it was Connie who did my hair. Anyway, she did an amazing job (I never thought Id be so happy with a haircut). I got a perm a few months ago so we was able to work the perm into a short haircut. I was so happy with the job that I tipped  her super well. DEFINITELY GOING BACK.  Users/EmilyTung

20080705 10:45:44 nbsp So I have been a regular customer for the past few years here, and think both John and Connie do great cuts. Since John left though, the lady who replaced him is terribly slow. She is improving, 1st time it took her an hour and a half to do a simple trim (on a male with a simple hair cut). Next time a little over an hour. Now she is finally under an hour but it might be a good idea to request Connie if you want a good cut. Unfortunately the people hired by john at his new place are claimed to be just as incompetent. I wish they were still a team. Users/MattHh

20080729 16:27:48 nbsp Recently got my hair cut by Connie. Im satisfied with the haircut, although it differs significantly from the hairstyle in the picture (which came from a book of their own). She took off more than I had wanted, so ladies, if you decide to get your hair cut here, make sure you make it clear exactly how much you want taken off. Note: The prices above do not match what I was charged  $18+tip (I originally had shoulder length hair; she cut off 23 inches using a texturizing razor). Users/at86

20080812 23:07:08 nbsp I love Connies work on my hair, she did amazing job on my hair and she gave me useful suggestions about how to take care my hair and skin. Connie did my eyebrow there and it is not hurtful as I expected. But most importantly, Connie did my hair on my wedding day, it is so gorgeous and even though it is an outdoor wedding, the hair stays on for the whole day. Thank you, Connie. Users/rainwing

20080914 22:24:48 nbsp The man does a really good on cutting bangs. The lady really doesnt!! Users/cookiemonster


20080918 14:59:53 nbsp Really great place.  I had my haircut by Connie whose very good at what she does and pretty witty to talk to.  I should have come here a lot earlier, Im really sad I only discovered this place when Im to leave Davis.  Users/BessieChu

20081010 17:06:59 nbsp I went to Kosmos today for the first time. Its $10 and up for a haircut. They charge you by how much hair you have and want to cut. For $18 (I have long hair), its really not bad at all if you ask Connie to cut it for you. I showed her a picture and she gave me an idea how it would look realistically on me. She used the razor to give my hair texture and my hair is a lot lighter than before. Its thinner, but the hairstyle doesnt look totally flat. I like the way she cut my side bangs too. It looks a lot edgier. Before, I went to Angies and got my haircut there twice because it was cheaper but I didnt like how they couldnt cut side bangs right. Personally, its worth a couple dollars more to go to Connie instead. Shes great!! I would definitely go back again! Users/PSL

20081018 10:35:45 nbsp Once you come in here once this will be your regular hair cut place in Davis. The place has just been remodeled so everything looks much nicer, the store owner is very nice and knows and understands hair, to put it simply the best hair salon in Davis at the best price.  Users/ktlam

20081116 11:01:59 nbsp IMPORTANT: Ok, how should i put this? I came in hoping to get a normal haircut. The instructions were simple, please TRIM my hair and SHORTEN it a LITTLE BIT. I dont know where my instructions became difficult. She started chopping away at my hair. 3 minutes into the cut, she even pointed out the hair on the little poncho thing you wear look how long your hair is. I was really nervous that she screwed up my hair, so i quickly asked she to have my glasses back for a quick check. She buzzed cut half of my head already. I was really pissed. I asked her to PLEASE not cut my hair any more shorter than they buzzed it. So they started to buzz the other side to make it even, and i was pretty sure that was the only way to get my hair looking O...K... So now i have this ugly buzz cut thats not what i asked for. I wanted maybe an inch off at the most, but now im missing 4 inches of hair. it will be 6 months until my hair is looking decent again. DO NOT COME HERE. I dont know what to do at school tommorow, as some teachers dont allow hoods/caps on in class. I am so pissed right now its not even funny. So dont come here. Users/HonHsu

20081206 10:47:01 nbsp I got my hair cut here about 1.5 years ago... while they did cut it shorter than the picture I decided on, I got the impression it was because it would grow out (making it more natural like in the picture).  I liked the cut but didnt come back for a trim all this time for fear of spending my parents money.  Im wondering why the man split away? Users/RebekahLee

20081224 12:10:56 nbsp I come here all the time

Its the only place I will get my haircut at

Connie is the best. She listens to you all the time and she spends time on your hair. She really cares.

For those who ask, Connie can speak both Mandarin and Cantonese. In addition, Connie speaks Vietnamese and her English is pretty darned good as well. Users/ThUn

20081228 18:06:09 nbsp I went into see Connie after a recommendation from a woman who has similar hair to me that goes to Kosmos...(brown, fine but lots of it, longish, simple style) Connie was great, very nurturing beyond the call of duty. I trusted her enough to go shorter than I really usually wear it just to get the dead ends off and she did a nice job. She told me not to pull it back so tight for a while and to massage my head once a day, as well as recommended more calcium in my diet! I appreciated her observation and motherly style without being intrusive and still giving me the cut I asked for.
 Users/ahbrapeach

20081228 18:08:16 nbsp And for the record, I agree, her English is fine. We had a great conversation. Users/ahbrapeach

20090107 11:39:35 nbsp Been coming to this place for over 3 years. Its the ONLY place I go to in Davis. Very patient, very thorough. HIGHLY recommended. Users/AnthonyLam

20090125 03:03:06 nbsp I have long dyed hair and went in for a layered trim. I made it clear to her that I wanted to keep my length (got a trim elsewhere before and got 4 inches of my hair cut off!) and she did a pretty decent job. My hair was still my desired length, but much lighter and healthier. I got to say I was really satisfied with my bangs though! And yeah I think their prices went up (from whats listed at top)cause the cut cost $18 + tip but thats still not bad.  Users/gato

20090208 17:41:59 nbsp Went there a few months ago and got my hair butchered by that place. The woman theres first question is fade or bowl cut?  Because I wanted something else she charged me 3 bucks extra and told me just to ask for a fade next time.  Go to razors edge, much better cut, cheaper, faster, and the guy knows what hes doing. Users/BrianBusemeyer

20090301 12:38:24 nbsp I was not blown out of the water by my hair trim, but I was no disappointed. It cost me $15 to get long hair trimmed, though the woman cutting my hair spent a longer time on the short hair of someone in front of me for only $10. This leads me to believe that being a returning customer means something here, especially because when I asked that the split ends be more effectively dealt with, she started complaining that shed already done more than Id initially asked for, even though Id initially asked for the split ends to be taken off. So, I would go here if $15 is your price and you dont need anything special. Users/warriorvoyager

20090512 23:18:00 nbsp Ive gone here twice, liked my cut both times! Im definitely sticking with this place. Users/JenniferGiang

20090702 19:09:43 nbsp Dont trust them with long hair. Bad experience there and friend had one also cut it double what I wanted for both of us. Urgh!!!! Users/Churro615

20090702 19:31:51 nbsp i went there wanting only 1 inch and a half but i got three inches cut! im churros friend btw (by the way) i would give it a 1 and a half stars. Users/pancake5556

20091002 12:31:51 nbsp Just went for the first time.  Had an ice conversation and the cut came out pretty good, especially since I always test my barbers by giving relatively vague directions.  If youre nice and friendly, it seems like she gives your cut a little more time and flair.  Im an asian male and got a cut after 1 month, so she probably couldnt tell the original style. Users/spellman23

20091103 14:36:06 nbsp Got my first cut there today. It was quite busy, but she still cut my hair very carefully (and well).
Im very happy with my hair cut, and am going back next time. Users/Oleg.Lokhvitsky

20091203 23:01:12 nbsp Extremely long wait even though the place was practically empty. I was there waiting, and some guy walked in without an appointment and the stylist went ahead and cut his hair before mine (even though I was there first) because his hair was quicker to cut. She also cut off ~4 inches of hair when I asked for ~1 inch off. Never going back.  Users/jrz

20100213 14:50:07 nbsp Worst. Haircut. Ever. She gave me a Hong Kong mullet, when I pointed out that it looked bad she told me that it was because my hair was curly. Yeah. A random drunk guy on the street would have done a much better job.  Users/FloridianPlywood

20100222 13:16:07 nbsp Absolutely amazing haircuts. Im in the military and I have to get my haircut every week and the owner, Connie, does a tremendous job on high skin tight fades / high and tight haircuts. I refuse to go anywhere else for a number of reasons: 1) The price is already lower than most other places in Davis 2) As someone mentioned before, shes incredibly meticulous but doesnt take a great deal of time and 3) She has a clipper that cuts up to the skin, which is what Im looking for in particular. I only recommend Kosmos whenever people ask me where I get my haircut. The only caveat, however, is that I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment cause it gets pretty busy in there. Users/H

20100228 20:02:28 nbsp I just got my hair cut from Kosmos Kreations earlier this afternoon. I brought in a picture of a haircut I kind of wanted, but Connie suggested a different cut because she thought it would go with my face better. She was very meticulous and even pointed out all the mistakes my last hair cut lady made and joked, watch how a professional does it. This is the first time in a while that Ive left with a completely satisfied haircut, and I definitely plan on returning in a couple months. I also got tips on how to maintain my haircut while its growing out. Definitely knew her stuff, and would recommend to others. :) Users/Jennyfish

20100715 16:15:00 nbsp They have a new hairstylist Gloria.  Shes much, much slower than Connie, and doesnt quite have as good of an eye.  Satisfactory boys haircut though. Users/spellman23

20100908 23:21:04 nbsp Ive been to Kosmos Kreations multiple times with many different people, and its interesting watching Connie workshe just knows how to make hair look good on people!
I finally went in to get my OWN hair cut about a month ago and I can honestly say that it was the first time Ive been completely satisfied with my hair. I brought in a few pictures of shorter hair for her, and Connie gave me advice on what would look good and be easiest to maintain. I let her do her thing, and I was so pleased at the end! I have had endless compliments on my hair, and I love that I dont have to do anything except brush and go, and it basically styles itself.

keep in mind Im girl with a round face and hair thicker than Rapunzels, and if she can make short hair look good on ME, she can make ANYONE look great!

20101009 16:10:39 nbsp This place is horrible. My friend went there and not only did they cut off 2 1/2 inches more than she asked for, they gossiped to eachother in Chinese about how bad her split ends were and how badly she took care of her hair, assuming she couldnt understand them. Unless you want a bad experience or a jacked up hair cut DO NOT COME HERE! Users/ViviS

20101103 15:28:31 nbsp There is a reason why this place is so empty! I gave this place a try because of all the positive comments on daviswiki. But she absolutely butchered my hairstyle. I showed her 5 different pictures of my previous hairstyle at different angle. She barely took a look at them and started dry cutting. That alone already alerted me that she was not very skilled hairstylist. All she used was the sheering scissor throughout the whole haircut. She did not even use an electric hair trimmer to trim the edge of my hair. Last but not least the edge of the different sides of head is quite uneven. will definitely steer clear of this place in the future and I would advise you to do the same(especially long to medium hairstyles).

P.S. I was getting a typical asian hairstyle which should have been their specialty.

Cost$15+ $2 tip and a fked up head of hair

20101117 08:54:49 nbsp Ive had my last 34 haircuts here. Each time time I was charged $20 + tip. Im surprised it says $18 for womens haircut.
She does a great job when she she isnt extremely booked. Sometimes she may cut off more than you really want so make sure to specify. Users/lyraaa

20101123 03:18:10 nbsp I used to work here and bring the music to brighten up this place. Make sure you speak simple english to Connie. Sometimes she has a hard time understanding what each client want. Shes really good at fades. If youre very picky about your hair, then you should go to another salon / barbershop. Great place for asian hairstyles Users/BrianWong

20110206 03:30:04 nbsp Connie is simply the best. She speaks English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Connie listens to all of your concerns and does a great job. Its best to schedule an appointment so that she focus her attention/time on you. She gets extremely busy sometimes, which tends to distract her. Keep in mind she is the owner and the only employee, so things can be very hectic for her. Ive never been dissatisfied wit her work. Shes also extremely friendly. Users/ThUn

20110222 15:22:34 nbsp Fast haircut, no wait, came out alright! Users/hanknguyen

20110326 10:30:40 nbsp Connie is the best. Ive been geting my haircut there for years. I simply show her a picture of the style I want, and she does it. She has a great eye for style and will make it match your face shape. Users/joneric

20110414 17:35:35 nbsp I definitely not recommend this place.  I went there twice because of cheap price, but I have stopped now.  The guy didnt take any hair cutting classes.  He also criticized a lot about how thin my hair is, he also called other girls in the shop to come look and touch my head (Im a girl too by the way).  It was totally embarrassing.  I thought the job of a barber is to give a person a hair cut that will suit them and make them look better, not to criticize and embarrass people because of the way they look.  So, I went to SuperCut and got my hair cut nicely, and now Im modeling parttime.  Hows that. Users/MeBear

20120125 14:27:29 nbsp I`ve been a long time customer of Connie`s and consider her a friend of mine. She owns this shop and is the stores only employee. Given that fact, she does an amazing job at what she does. I dont go anywhere else in Davis for haircuts! On a side note, sometimes she gets especially busy on Sunday with family or community obligations and may not get to the store until 1pm. However, if she knows you want a haircut on Sundays, she will rearrange her schedule to fit yours, just call her up ahead of time and make an appointment.  Users/NathaliePham

20130108 00:33:40 nbsp I wanted to update my last post about Kosmos, which was back in 2010. Over 2 years later, Connie is still the only hair cut person in Davis who I trust with my hair. When I go in, she still knows exactly how I like my hair, and continues to offer input if I want to try anything different. Ive always gotten a lot of compliments about my hair since I started going to see Connie, even from numerous strangers in grocery stores (lol), and multiple people around campus have asked where I get it done/have been satisfied with their haircuts as well.

Side note: Shes fluent in Vietnamese and Chinese (I believe both Mandarin and Cantonese, pretty sure others have commented about this), but can speak English very well too. We often have friendly chats switching between English and Vietnamese, but its still always a great experience when I see her every ~6 weeks. Even if its roughly $20+ a cut, I dont mind, because I always love the end result! Users/Jennyfish

20130926 18:15:12 nbsp Connie is absolutely wonderful! For 6 years, I have not let anyone else cut my hair. I have long blonde hair and I really enjoy that she does a dry cut. She never cuts an inch more than I ask her to, does not suggest weird styles and certainly does not do her own thing as I have experienced in the past with other hair stylists. She is very professional and a perfectionist so all layers and hairs will be precisely cut and in place. I have brought several friends to her that are always satisfied and for about $20 I walk out with my hair done exactly the way I like it. Womens hair cuts are her specialty!  Users/amandasinclaire
