20100620 04:11:52 nbsp same people as Thai Dynamite?  Users/StevenDaubert
  20100620 07:03:17 nbsp When I was there in early June for dinner the hostess was the same, but the food was different from the Thai Dynamite offerings. Leads me to believe the kitchen staff is new.   Users/3prong
  According to an article in the Enterprise (June 20, 2010), its a new owner.   Users/CovertProfessor



20100622 22:03:49 nbsp I like this place. I went here last Friday with a group of 10 and the food and service were both great. I had pad woon sen with tofu and it was quite tasty. Plenty of black pepper to give it a nice kick but not too spicy that it overwhelmed the rest of the dish. I also tried three of my friends dishes  2 other noodle dishes and 1 curry dish  and they were all good. The food was also reasonably priced and unpretentious, unlike some other Thai places in town. As a Thai who grew up eating some pretty good home cooking, I give the food here a thumbs up.
The only downside, as I see it, is the location and (if you care about these kinds of things) the atmosphere. The place still looks like a diner, which makes the food seem a little out of place. The Friday night I was there, there were only 2 other tables. The upside to that was that they had no problem seating and serving our large group.
I encourage you to give this place a try soon (in case it goes out of business). Users/Nerissa

20100624 14:40:10 nbsp I was excited to try this new Thai restaurant with my friends, however was disappointed by the quality of food.  The steamed rice that they served with our lunch entrees looked brown from being old and over cooked.  My friend initially thought we had been served brown rice...but I can guarantee you that it was not the case. Users/Magster

20100630 16:44:52 nbsp Tried this with a coworker and thought it was just soso.  Thai Dynamite was so much better. I felt the same way about the rice.  It was mushy and didnt taste fresh.  Then they served a blah iceberg lettuce salad with a really sweet thai peanut dressing and chicken and rice soup.  Huh? I think the soup is the soup that Cindys was serving for the nonthai menu.  In any event, may try again, but probably not with all the other good thai in Davis. Users/LokiAbbi

20110330 21:46:13 nbsp Not the best thai restaurant in town.  The rice is way to mushy. Users/purplemonkey

20110810 18:36:54 nbsp I was nearby so popped in for some green curry.  It was made to my specifications and everything was delightful.  The WiFi easily worked very well. Users/BruceHansen

20111008 19:51:35 nbsp I came here last picnic day.  The waiter overcharged us for the bill.  Then, when I pointed it out, he left, and came back with a second bill that was also incorrect.  I was most annoyed.  The Thai food was okay, but considering that there are other Thai restaurants in town that arent either trying to rip me off or incompetent at addition, I wont be back. Users/Mbrowne

20111016 14:56:14 nbsp This is a sad excuse for Thai food.  Food in general, for that matter.  Bland to the point of flaccid, and substituting cheaper ingredients in place of the traditional ones.  I was severely disappointed and wont come back.  Its not that hard or expensive to make very good Thai food.  I should have known that a place which shares it space with a diner is going to be compromised.  I wont make that mistake again.   Users/Marshall

20111216 16:58:04 nbsp food is good but looks like they over charge every time we went there.  they must put the gratuity in the final price already! Users/JeffA

20111216 16:58:29 nbsp alright thai food, horrible american food Users/JeffA

20120202 12:19:54 nbsp Went to Cindys in the evening when it turns into the Thai restaurant.  Surprisingly delicious.  We usually go to Taste of Thai, but thought of trying this place out base on its review & the consideration that authentic thai is usually not favored by the general population due to the unusual spice and ingredients not common in most area areas.  We got green curry with the choice of squid(I think it was number 37 or one of the other numbers above it).  The culmination of spice, bamboo & green beans were delicious in a way that was exciting and familiar, sort of reminded me of home cook thai food.  The second dish we got was red duck curry, which also has a nice taste & balance to the coconuty base.  The servers were very nice, really good customer service, despite the longer wait, but I suppose they want to give you enough time to look over the menue & the thai tea had unlimited refill, which is a plus.  I found it just right, not too sweet. Users/kikao

20121102 02:38:38 nbsp I love this place.  I could eat here every day.  The food is great and the staff is freindly.  Best breakfast in town and the Thai food is just as good. Users/rmk734

We showed up (close to closing) but the open sign was still on. To turn us away they said we are closing in 5 minutes everyone hates the late table but that is part of the industry. Disheartening... Daubert

20130321 21:12:46 nbsp This USED TO BE my favorite Thai resaturant in town. However, the last three or four times Ive been here, it has been absolutely terrible. Tonight is the straw that really broke the camels back though. I picked up take out, and for the second time in a row they got the meat wrong on one of the two dishes I ordered (tofu instead of beef). They also have screwed up the spiciness in a major way the last two times. Last time, they mixed up the orders that were supposed to be spicy and mild. This time, they made the spicy order WAY too spicy. I ordered a 4/5 in spiciness, but this is something that I do routinely both here and at other Thai restaurants in town. I really like a solid kick to my food, but this pretty much left me crippled. I drank three glasses of cold water and a glass of milk and was still dying. This was after only a few bites; Im going to have to throw out the rest. In conclusion, I will NEVER, EVER go back to this restaurant, despite its convenience for me and how much I used to like it. Oh, by the way, I think the manager is uncomfortably casual and borderline unprofessional. Users/AlexPerkins

20131023 14:08:51 nbsp Tried the Massamun curry with chicken for lunch today. I was with two companions. One ordered French toast, the other red curry with chicken and brown rice and chicken satay.
The complimentary soup and salad was pitiful. Soup: little more than chicken broth flavored with cabbage and green onions and sparingly small bits of carrot and green bean. Salad: cabbage and some a couple spring greens and carrot peel shavings smothered in hollondaise sauce.
Cindys French toast with eggs and bacon appeared quickly and looked yummy. My other companions red curry with chicken satay that appeared tasty. My Massamun curry arrived at the same time as hers and seemed fine though the rice was overcooked where they had scraped it from the pan. The curry had large potato chunks which, although well cooked, were not appetizing as it was obvious that they were green. I removed them all from my curry and ate well although I found a small piece of what I assume was beef in the last bite of my meal.
Not returning for the Thai in the near future. Users/E.C.H.
