http://ucdavis.facebook.com/profile.php?id3201807 Kris Fricke is the former Chief Justice of the ASUCD Court.  In this position he swore in four ASUCD Presidents, presided over about seven cases, and was considered for impeachment three times.  On 03/10/05 The ASUCD Senate concluded he has jedi powers.  Allegedly he caused the ASUCD Senate to think that one of two operative sentences in a bill meant the opposite of what it clearly meant.  This was subsequently changed. He has also expressed a believe that it would be in ASUCDs best interest if bills and actions that are found to be in violation of state or federal law can be reversed by the ASUCD Court rather than necessitating a lawsuit.  Court Vice Chair Daniel Raff consistently tried to confuse this with saying that the court has the power to try UCD students for breaking state and federal laws, such as vandalism, theft and murder, as well as stating that the U.S. Constitution does not provide U.S. citizens with the right to privacy.

He may or may not be associated with the infamous http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/ EMOSNAIL livejournal (Echidna Media Organization S.N.A.I.L. Project), and likes http://www.flickr.com/photos/commissariat/ photography.

Warning: Though this apparently comes as a suprise to some people, Fricke considers calling for his impeachment to be a very hostile action and will immediately undertake the most energetic defense possible.  If you do not seriously aspire to remove Fricke, I strongly suggest you spare everyone a lot of drama and kindly request Frickes presence in a venue other than his impeachment hearing.  Last time someone called Fricke before a Senate Removal Hearing, it directly resulted in the complete collapse of her party.

If you still hunger for relevant links, Justice Fricke has caused the creation of this http://www.geocities.com/winged_snail/cntnt.htm link page as part of his shockingly shoddy website.

Did You Know: Oxford Circle Park (AKA Little Big People Park)is was Kris first and most physical lasting mark on Davis.  As one of three people on the City Renovations subCommittee he was influential in deciding on the final equipment composition, and specifically the final red/blue colour scheme was wholly his idea (versus blue/yellow (school colours) and green/silver (to blend in with the trees) yuck!).  Kris still considers the park with its unique geodesic equipment to be his lil baby.

It is well established hearsay that Kris owns a grappling hook, studied propaganda so much that he was asked to be a guest lecturer for a propaganda class in Spring 2005.

  20041222 18:16:02 nbsp Erg, it looks like you guys basically never have cases.  I guess its cool then  I was just concerned about 200 court cases or something :)  Just make sure they arent copyrighted ?  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  20041222 18:20:29 nbsp The cases are surely public information.  No government documents have copyrights.  Users/KrisFricke
   20041222 18:47:27 nbsp Further elaboration on copyrights  things on the official ASUCD webpage might be copyrighted  at least Alex Park (the IT guy) might THINK theyre copyrighted and get butthurt, but for example Senate Resolutions / Bills, minutes, budgets, (Court findings) and other official government business are certainly not copyrighten  Users/KrisFricke

   20041222 18:30:03 nbsp Yeah, sounds great.  They are very relevant to Davis, arent found anywhere else, and are public information.  You might want to put a note on the main court page about where (if you were so inclined) you could find official copies of the cases (as these cant be official because they are edited, etc).  Even though they might not even be avail. at SGAO, might as well say its worth a try.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051212 20:30:30 nbsp I was already thinking about that when I went through it  thats why nearly all of them were orphaned redirects to Userpages, not actual pages. Most were a result of the page being renamed and the original not being deleted and never used. A couple were nicknames. I dont think anyone used the recently made hitler tower. B & F is just too vague. Angies Salon was an orphan, even though Angies Beauty Salon is the first search result.  Engineers wasnt fair, as it directed to engineering students, even though there is also a page Architects & Engineers. The rest were all userpages. I doubt I messed up any external links, but if I did  sorry. Users/EdWins ES

20060308 18:31:47 nbsp i feel very strongly about ridding the wiki of stupid inside jokes Users/TravisGrathwell
  20060309 14:39:06 nbsp Its not an inside joke if it was never discussed previous to being put on the wiki, and has never since been discussed except in reference to its placement on the wiki; and that is the situation with the ASUCD Gulag.  It is not an inside joke. Users/KrisFricke
   Why does its being discussed outside of the wiki have any bearing on whether its an inside joke? If anything that just makes it an inside joke that originated on the wiki. As long as there is no such place as the ASUCD Gulag and discussion of such place is limited to the titters of a http://ucdavis.facebook.com/profile.php?id3201807 couple Users/BrentLaabs russophiles it will continue to be an inside joke. Users/TravisGrathwell
   Whether there are any inside aspects of the matter are indispensible to whether or not it is in inside joke.  An inside joke requires context available only to people who were there when it was created.  References to the ASUCD Gulag began entirely in the public sphere and hinges on no knowledge not available to the general public.  While I understand you and others consider this wiki to be http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Serious_business serious business, I strongly believe we should not take ourselves too seriously and should encourage the use of publicly understandable humour upon this wiki.
   20060309 14:57:51 nbsp You could make the ASUCD Gulag page, perhaps? Users/JosephBleckman

20060316 20:19:55 nbsp Kris, the media board talked about the decision and two things came of it. 1) A senator may write a bill changing the law (not technically retroactive but still kinda ex post facto) and 2) from the feeling I got. The Aggie will not be renewing their contract next year. So in a way, everyone wins. Or no one does. Who knows... it isnt a competition, anyway. Users/RobRoy
  Actually, Brent already wrote and passed a bill which changed the way the websites thing works a little... the general idea is that Creative Media has to make and store the websites unless Alex Park approves an alternate plan.  I dont know if that would work for the Aggie.  Personally, I think a more interesting question is if the Aggie is allowed to Lamargate endorse candidates for City Council (which I said they could in the same bill) or whether the ASUCD Constitution prohibits it.  And whether case law would override our constitution.  So much fun! Users/BrentLaabs

20060420 14:56:04 nbsp The going off air edit description made me lol Users/EdWins ES

I maintain that member is more neutral than justice.  Everybody agrees that Aguilera and company are members of the ASUCD Court, but not everybody agrees that they are justices. I try to be neutral, but the Court doesnt have to, so feel free to change it back.PH
  You and Users/SteveOstrowski, apparently.  I have to be neutral, you do not.  The constitution has referred to us as justices since 1996. For a short time from 20012003 it was erroniously changed, but I believe that has been fixed and the Constitution should refer to us as justices again.  Anyone who disagrees that Aguilera & co are justices is in a small minority now I think, and in my opinion flat out wrong. Users/KrisFricke

20060503 12:18:09 nbsp You asked about the wiki graphics about number of edits etc. a while back... so I added them to Wiki Community/Graphics.
 Users/BrentLaabs

20060504 12:43:18 nbsp Pet peeve of mine too... but in that singular case, it seems right.  There are Catholic symbols being used in conjunction with other Christian symbols.  I.e., there are generic Christian symbols paired with Catholic (a subset of Christian) specific symbols.  Thus the statement is the one time in a thousand when that phrase is used and is correct. Users/JabberWokky

20060504 12:46:00 nbsp Or to put it the other way around, some symbols are Catholic specific and others general to Christianity.  There are no Protestant specific symbols.  Thus Catholic and Christian symbols, not Catholic and Protestant symbols. Users/JabberWokky

20060505 01:01:31 nbsp I suppose you may be right Jabberwocky.  Although one could be saucy / ironic about it and refer to the differences as Catholic and catholic, as capitalization implies the Roman Catholic church but uncapitalized refers to christian church in general...  Users/KrisFricke

20060505 02:52:54 nbsp Sort of the way that Jabberwocky refers to a poem by the good Rev. Dodgson and JabberWokky is a kiboesque string designed to be unique?  ;) Users/JabberWokky

20060829 13:24:47 nbsp Mr. Chief Justice, Im going to be sending you an Email in a day or two with some stuff. I just wanted to give you advance warning, kinda raise the excitement level a bit. I want it to feel like Christmas morning when you open this work of art that is my impending message. Hope summer is going well, by the way. Users/KevinPowers

20061205 23:51:45 nbsp Thats right Kris, people can acll me the Holy Trinity. Wait, dont do that, its most likely a bad idea. In other news, I might be the only former justice to argue infront of the Court. Call be Mr. Trailblazer instead. Users/KevinPowers

20061207 12:44:39 nbsp Yeah, its Steve Ostrowski, it allows me to have the ability to have multiple public pages with different spellings.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20061214 11:11:52 nbsp Yeah... I have no idea whatsoever as to what the Advisors do.  The plan thing I did pick up from an entry, Vicki Swetts last paragraph.  Im still not sure what that last paragraph means, or why it would be worth noting that the Advisors do not have a Plan (as you edited the entry).  Why is it important to note? Users/JabberWokky

20061214 11:15:37 nbsp I had frequent clashes with Vicki Swett over what she was and was not obligated to do for student government.  She variously refused to do anything for me and told me I had to go through her for things.  Similarly, the recent controversy with Tucker stems from disagreement about what exactly his role is.  The purpose of Admin Plans is to settle these debates, so that what every entity in ASUCD exactly does and its relation to every other relevant entity is clearly described.  In lieu of my conflicts with Swett and Leathers with Tucker, I believe it is noteworthy that the Advisor does not have an Admin Plan Users/KrisFricke

20061214 11:17:12 nbsp Ah... let me try to put that in the entry in a way that somebody who doesnt know what one is can understand. Users/JabberWokky

20061214 11:18:11 nbsp Oh, do you know if the official title is Student Government Advisor or ASUCD Advisor?  Is there an official document that uses the one or other? Users/JabberWokky

20061214 12:24:18 nbsp Just so you know, the http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/government/advisor ASUCD website says hes the unit manager of Student Government. Users/JabberWokky

20061214 13:00:05 nbsp Hmm.  Ill email Mark I guess.  Im pretty sure thats wrong, since I know for a fact that Mark is the Advisors boss, and Mark is in the Student Government unit.  The ASUCD Webpage is frequently less accurate than the Wiki, even regarding ASUCD. Users/KrisFricke

20061214 13:01:59 nbsp Actually, is that even worth bothering emailing Mark about?  I dont think its much of a matter of dispute.  The problem should probably be more accurately addressed by having someoen (Brent?) fix the ASUCD page, which Im certain is wrong. Users/KrisFricke

20061214 13:03:36 nbsp Mark is an employee of the University paid to make sure every aspect of ASUCD does not fuck up, not just the Student Government Unit, as director Tuckers boss is Mark Champagne. Users/JamesSchwab

20061214 13:08:28 nbsp Is that true? Thats wack.  Is the Aggie Advisor technicially the Aggie unit director?  Other units have student unit directors, why isnt the ASUCD President technically the ASUCD unit director?! Users/KrisFricke
  Thats just the way Student Services and the Administration have it set up. Users/PaulHarms ph

20061214 13:11:24 nbsp No the Advisor is the unit director for the Student Government officeSGAO, a better, accurate title would be SGAO Office Manager. Users/JamesSchwab
  SGAO isnt a unit (and Rachel actually manages it, anyway).  According to the administration, though, Student Government is a Unit of ASUCD.

20061214 13:34:48 nbsp Ah, my source was an old job description of the ASUCD Advisor which said they were the director of SGAO.  Anyway, if thats how the Administration has it set up, than thats that  but that doesnt make it Not Wack. Users/KrisFricke

20061215 12:28:45 nbsp Uhh... you do know that the EditLock has been removed for quite awhile now, right?  Or were you being sarcastic? Users/JabberWokky

20061215 13:34:46 nbsp No worries  it was buried in the notes about one of the software upgrades.  Basically, if two people edit different lines in an entry, both sets of changes are merged.  The problem was that people would open an entry to edit, and then not edit anything and the entry would be locked for ten minutes.  Or they would take 15 minutes to edit.  It was just one of those annoying things that people seemed to have trouble with.  I just mentioned it to you because I figured you thought people were ignoring the fact you were editing and starting to get frustrated.  It wasnt personal.  :) Users/JabberWokky
