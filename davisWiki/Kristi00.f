20100308 12:54:25 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Kristi, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I moved your comment from the Talk page for Bookmarks over to the Varsity Theater entry for you.  Just click Edit or add a comment using the Comment button, and it will appear on the page youre looking at.  Talk is generally used for kind of a temporary editor chat thing... itll make sense once you get used to the wiki.  Once again, welcome!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
