Born: June 3, 1987

UC Davis Student (Third Year)
I transfered to UCD this fall from Saddleback College in south Orange County, Ca.
This is the first time Ive ever lived somewhere other than Mission Viejo.  Im still getting used to the fact that not everyone uses a car as a main mode of transportation, and that you can actually use the public trans system!

Im a professional portrait Photography photographer specializing in children and families, equestrian, and commercial photos.
Please visit Kristine Kreations Photography my wiki page for details.
My work can be seen in various websites (besides my own) including http://www.istockphoto.com/kristinekreations iStockPhoto.com and http://www.betterphoto.com/gallery/free/gallery.asp?memberID153513 BetterPhoto.com.

I have 13 photos in the gallery of the official Weird Al Yankovic website (http://www.weirdal.com/gallery.htm WeirdAl.com).  The photos were taken at the 2007 OC Fair concert series.  I also had three photos, unrelated to Weird Al, displayed in the juried gallery at the OC Fair this year.  One of those photos is the mare and foal pictured below.

I am a published photographer.  I did two cover stories for OH Magazine (http://www.obesityhelp.com/magazine ObesityHelp.com), and a third cover story has been shot but not yet printed.  The two issues are 2006 Issue 3, and 2006 Issue 6.
