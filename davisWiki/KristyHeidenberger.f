Kristy Heidenberger  is a UC Davis graduate with a B.A. in Communication and a minor in Political Science and is now pursuing a masters degree in teaching in Washington, D.C.

She likes kitties, Squirrels and the colour pink.  In fact she worked at a kitty warehouse on Campus, where she was what you might call a http://www.flickr.com/photos/84358187@N00/17000181/ kitty technician.  The socalled CBarn keeps and raises cats for nutritional studies.  She also has a kitten named Bailey that she adopted from the Yolo County Animal Shelter.

Kristy is from Pleasanton in the bay area.  This is not the town superman is from, and it is not the location of the movie Pleasantville, though I do recommend watching that movie.  She now resides in San Diego, CA and works at the Helen Woodward Animal Center.

Kristy is forever on a cupcakebakingrampage and makes a new batch of cupcakes practically weekly.  A few favorites so far are the White Russian Cupcakes, Dark Chocolate & Wine Cupcakes, and the Malt Chocolate (whopper) Cupcakes.

Also she has a lot of sass.  In fact we say she is sass in a glass.

     I really like living here.  Being able to walk to class and being so close to the ARC are probably my favorite aspects.  The management is a bit disorganized and you do have to complete two community credits a quarter in order to be elligible to resign your lease for the subsequent year.  Completing the credits is relatively simple and it is best not to wait until the last minute during finals.   Giving blood gets you one credit, so you usaully only end up having to attend one event a quarter and sometimes they are pretty interesting (most of the time not). Kristy

20110307 18:54:51 nbsp Enjoy the beltway!  I have friends in DC, and there are some nifty things around that area.  Im guessing youre towards the northern end of town (up by the universities), but http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid10698973979572588280 Panaderia Latina is a great bakery if you ever get down that way (ignore Googles misspelling of the name).  Its simple fresh baked goods of an amazingly wide variety. Users/JabberWokky
