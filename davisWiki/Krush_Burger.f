Their food truck has been known to visit Davis on occasion, mainly hitting up Cousteau Place during lunch hours.

Somewhat unusual for Davis  they offer no vegetarian options vegetarian burger.




Krush burger is local out of Sac and Krushes every burger onto the grill. I expect it to compete nicely / exceed Habit style spots ~SD

I had a chance to try Krush Burger tonight after hearing about how great their food was.  Maybe its due to the fact this is the second day that they have opened, but the food was unfortunately, nothing special at all.  The higher prices, smaller portions, and mediocre at best food does reaffirm that burgers and brew is hands down the best burger place to eat in Davis, fairly priced, well portioned,  and overall good quality.  If youre looking for something faster, Id go with Habit Burger as well.  Sorry Krush, I was really pulling for you guys and hoping the food would be bomb (got the original and the ninja and fries), and a red alarm definitely goes off for me when the thought Hey, i think i could make this goes through my head when Im dining out.  ~SG

All in all, two sliders, a side of fries and beer cost me close to twenty bucks. Sorry krush, but with Burger and Beer deals around town for 10 or 12 bucks, I dont see myself going back.

20140407 09:41:42 nbsp Well my wife and I finally had a chance to head on over to Krush.  I had the Cowbell and the Philly slider combo with Fries and a Track 7 IPA and my wife had the Salmon and Original Slider.  It was $21.95 I believe.  Yea it was a bit more expensive than Habit or In N Out but we were thinking of going to Dos Coyotes and while it was less food it was similar in price.  The interior of the place was nice and clean, beer selection solid, and the counter service was efficient.  We had special requests for all 4 of the burgers and they all came out perfect.

The burgers themselves were really good in our opinions.  My wife loved the Salmon slider and thought the Original was fine but nothing too special.  I totally enjoyed the Philly and thought it was great until having the Cowbell which was outstanding.  Happy to have them in the town and especially in that shopping place to add some variety.  We dont eat a ton of burgers but we do enjoy them and Krush would certainly be considered an option next time we are craving the cow.

The food is pricey and the customer service inadequacy is very disappointing. You expect a friendly, accommodating staff, but at Krushburger you get none of that. The workers look like they were straight out of the cell block. You also have to wait forever with their pager system.  Users/MichelleKwon

20140601 14:35:41 nbsp After multiple visits Id have to reiterate that this place is really good!  We have been there at least 6 times and the burgers and consistent, high quality and extremely tasty.  Yes it may be a dollar or two more than Dos coyotes to feed two people but we both leave extremely happy with the choice.  The customer service has only gotten better and I think they take a lot of pride in making their food here.  The beers on tap are really great choices and not the same ones you see in most places!  21st Amendment, Track 7 and Ballast Point?  Extremely awesome!  Today to top it off, I found out they would make a grilled cheese, small fry, milk and a soft serve cone for my 5 year old for like 4.50 extra.  Everyone today left happy and Im not ashamed to admit Im addicted to the cowbell.

A great addition to Davis and especially in the Marketplace.  yummy Users/loneshark
