Im a fourthyear psychology and Women and Gender Studies womens studies double major. Aiming to graduate this spring. I love going to school in Davis, the friendly atmosphere, the multitude of coffee shops filled with twentysomethings studying for midterms. Besides going to class, I usually have a parttime job. So far Ive worked at coffee shops, a water store, as a house cleaner, a mental health rec aide, and am currently a nanny. Id like to find a job that I can keep for longer than 6 months, but its also kind of fun changing it up also.

I spend a lot of time in cafes around town, and am hopelessly addicted to coffee. I also love books and music, especially music from mother Russia, my home country.

And Davis is definitely the best when its cold and rainy... I cant wait till fall.
