At Kumon, our math and reading programs help children of all ages and levels become eager, independent selflearners. Unlike tutoring sessions, Kumon helps children learn how to learn on their own, and develops strong academic skills. Our students gain a sense of confidence that will help them in the classroom and beyond. (Taken from http://www.kumon.com Kumon website)
