However, Kung Fu over the years has encompassed likely thousands of different styles. However, many of them fell into obscurity over the years because of secrecy, or because the style was absorbed, or transformed into another style. Kung Fu is often categorized into Soft or Hard styles, or Internal and External. Hard or External styles focus on physical techniques. They may rely on developing strength, speed or other techniques, and generally can vary from style to style. Internal or Soft styles are influenced by Taoism and Chinese Internal Medicine with a focus on relaxation and the circulation of chi.  It is claimed by some practitioners of Internal styles that the skill that can be attained by an External style is limited by body constraints, whereas with Internal styles, there are no limits to skill.
