Hello, Im Kurt Sassenrath, a Computer Science and Engineering Computer Science Engineering major at UC Davis since 2008.  Ill be the first to say that Im an academic at heart, with a passion for most of the sciences, though engineering ties me down.

My typical activities include programming projects, gaming (video and board), bowling, and cooking.

C/C++
REBOL
Java
Javascript
Python
Perl
PHP
LISP

I have experience in web design (HTML/CSS) and Photoshop.  I enjoy creating art, and have created several brush set resources for Photoshop, which can be found http://dragonfire3k3.deviantart.com here.
