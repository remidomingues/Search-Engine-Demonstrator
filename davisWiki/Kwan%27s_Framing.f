20080503 16:14:30 nbsp Fabulous frame shop.  I was able to order a beveled mirror in a custom size with the frame of my choice (for less than it would cost to get a premade one in the same size elsewhere), and it looks absolutely lovely.  Very quick, professional and courteous service; its wonderful to work with such a kind and polite business owner. Users/JenThornton

20081119 16:11:01 nbsp My wife and I just had our second item framed at this shop. It is amazing, and Mr. Kwan is the sweetest man alive. His work is flawless. The man would outshine the Mona Lisa if he framed it. Users/condemned2bfree

20081225 12:34:45 nbsp I had two items framed at Kwans this month and am very happy with the outcome.  One item, a Chinese painting, required special mounting that Mr. Kwan expertly handled.  His shop provides quality service and results.  Users/Edward

20090123 10:09:42 nbsp I have had two very meaningful items framed here. A collage of my brothers wedding photos, vows, and program, which turned out beautifully. My brother loves it and my whole family was blown away. I have also had my PhD framed here. With both, Mr. Kwan took a great deal of time to speak to me and learn exactly what I wanted and created beautiful masterpieces. He is a sweetheart of a man kind and generous and extremely good at what he does. I really cant recommend him highly enough.  Users/Zeeba

20100323 20:59:03 nbsp If you have pictures to frame, go to Kwans!  I called Aaron Brothers and Michaels to get a quote for the least expensive prematted photo (18x24).  Aaron Brothers was slightly lessexpensive than Michaels because they were having their big framing sale.  I went into Kwans because I prefer to shop local when possible, and his least expensive frame was the cheapest!  I ended up really like one of the more expensive frame options and he worked with me to get it closer to my price range.  It was a GREAT experience!     Users/CharlieMurphy

20110405 16:02:38 nbsp I agree with all the other comments.  Fast, friendly, reasonably priced, and quality work  this is the place I plan to do my framing! Users/ScottWieking

20120114 14:59:14 nbsp I agree as well. Im a totally DIY guy, and priced out frame components online first. I had 2 pieces of artwork (1 small and 1 postersized lithograph), and it was going to cost over $300 online, plus I would have to buy the frames and mattes based on photos only, and I would have to assemble everything myself. I went to Kwans and ended up paying $435 including tax. The small picture cost ~$190, and the large one was $245. Yes, thats about 1/3 more expensive, but they give you extremely good advice. I ended up with more unique frames than I ever would have chosen online, and also learned that there are >20 shades of white mattes  who would have known? Anyway, Kwans completed the frames a day ahead of schedule and they were done perfectly. For anyone (like me) who only needs to frame a couple of pictures every year or two, Kwans is the only way to go. Users/sbyun

20120711 13:02:43 nbsp I am extremely happy with the service I received here.  The two people who helped me were very friendly and knowledgeable.  They helped me to select a good frame for my print, giving me helpful suggestions on the frame and the glass.  They were able to get the framed print back to me quickly.  And most important of all, it looks great.  I am thoroughly pleased with the whole experience. It was a little more than I had expected to pay, but it was worth it. Users/CovertProfessor
