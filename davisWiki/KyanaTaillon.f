Hi. Im new to the area & new to DavisWiki. My family and I moved here six months ago so my husband can attend grad school at the UC. Im a photographer (this is me in front of my studio on Main Street in Woodland). I have two little boys, the younger is named Davis. :)  I recently (and finally!) scored a vintage Schwinn bike that Im excited to take with me on Davis bike trail adventures, finding lovely and interesting locations to shoot. Im constantly working on photographyrelated projects and have a bit of an obsession with rescuing things from thrift stores & yard sales.

You might want to close out the wiki you created by going to it (http://kyanataillon.wikispot.org/Front_Page) and going to wiki settings and looking for the option to close it forever.

20100219 10:24:07 nbsp Yep.  Looks like it has been deleted.  No worries... its actually easier than that to edit and do stuff, you accidentally got into the site tools to make a new wiki site.  Not a big deal.  Like Jason said, welcome to the wiki!  Were all friendly volunteers willing to help each other out, so just ask! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
