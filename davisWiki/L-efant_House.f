The Lefant House (20012005) was located at 712 L Street, named for its location and the large ceramic elephant near the front door.

The Lefant House was home to Users/GregorySmith Greg Smith, bassist/vocalist of Keep Your Distance (the band practiced in the garage).  Other tenants included JeffMacDonald Suzie, BenMcCord Brocktune, and Chester the Molester.  Previous roommates include Ilya (The Mad Russian), Rob (and often girlfriend Katie), Jacob (subleaser extrodinaire), and Matt Id rather be at UCLA Franko.

Aside from Keep Your Distance KYD practices, the Lefant House was also home to occasional parties, NHL Hitz tournaments, Robotmedia movie shoots, and way too much World of Warcraft.

The only show ever played at the Lefant House featured Unless and Keep Your Distance rocking the fuck out on Saturday, April 30th, 2005.  It was Keep Your Distance KYDs final show before dissolution, with Users/DonovanKelley Don skipping work to play an excessively long cover of Louie Louie and even longer breakdowns.

The Lefant House was abandoned (read: moved out of) in the Summer of 2005.

Currently the Lefant House (aka Black Hole) is home to the band Olive Drive and a yet to be named metal project.  Residents include Kris Rosa, girlfriend Marissa, CormacMcHugh and the Bob.  Users/DonovanKelley Don is still known to make an occasional appearance.

Olive Drive played in the backyard 7/11/08 with an appearance by Bones http://www.myspace.com/bonespdx from portland who opened.

Band practice, Sudwerk and PBR drinking, and various parties continue to shadow the landscape.
