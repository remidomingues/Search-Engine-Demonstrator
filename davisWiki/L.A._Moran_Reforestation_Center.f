The L.A. Moran Reforestation Center is one of two centers in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protectionâ€™s tree nursery program (the other is the Magalia Reforestation Center in Paradise, CA). Together these nurseries have provided up to 1.8 million seedlings a year for reforestation projects throughout California.

The center is also home to the only staterun seed bank in California, which performs genetic research and stores more than $4 million worth of seed owned by the state and private companies.

Budget cuts in 2004 resulted in the suspension of nursery operations here and at the Magalia Center, though the seed bank operations continue.  Plans are supposedly in the works to reestablish the container nursery program.

The center sits on 40 acres along Chiles Road, and is adjacent to the CDF Mobile Equipment Facility.
