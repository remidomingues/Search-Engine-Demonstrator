L.E.A.D. is an acronym for Leadership, Empowerment, Activism and Determination.  Founded in the Winter 2000 ASUCD election at the R.E.A.C.H. Retreat, and active between 20002010, L.E.A.D. was the longest running ASUCD slate in modern ASUCD history. For most of its history, L.E.A.D. was the progressive, leftleaning slate, especially during the years where it fought for control of ASUCD against Student Focus and GO. L.E.A.D. won the executive office 7 times during the years it was active on campus, and at its height controlled 10 out of 12 of the ASUCD Senate seats. See also: wiki:lead:Front page Lead Wiki

 Winter 2001 

In response to massive violations of election codes on all sides in the previous election, the elections committee instituted a system of violation points. If any candidate earned three or more violation points, they would be disqualified. Each candidate was given a copy of this policy, the election codes, and signed a statement saying they agreed to follow the codes. Later, the LEAD ticket argued that the campaign agreement they had signed was unconstitutional and that they therefore didnt have to follow it.

Going into the election, the election committee had assessed two violation points to the LEAD slate for various violations of the elections code. LEAD, in a landslide election, took all open positions in the election. After the election, LEAD was charged with five more violations of the election code. When the elections committee declined to issue a violation point (and the other four alleged violations were pending), the person who brought the violation appealed the decision to the ASUCD court. The court found that a violation had occurred, issued a third violation point, and disqualified the LEAD slate, thus giving the seats to the runners up.

The day after the decision, the LEAD candidates held a rally in which they bashed the decision as racist. At the same time, suspicious KKK fliers appeared around campus, resulting in the local paper The Davis Enterprise contacting the KKKs Grand Wizard in Indiana for a quote. They were likely posted by LEAD in order to play the victim and justify their accusations of racism. According to one student, the first time I saw the flyer, I assumed that either Bledsoe did it or DCR did. At least one UC Davis custodian observed the an Africanamerican and caucasian student posting the fliers during the wee hours in the morning. Although it was never proven, rumor had it that these two students were Tiqula Bledsoe and his campaign manager, Edgar Chen.

After spring break, the ASUCD court reconvened and reexamined their ruling. They came to the conclusion that while LEAD had violated election codes, the elections committee had the discretion in issuing violation points. The other four alleged election code violations had been dismissed by the elections committee at this point. The court found that the elections committee hadnt investigated those allegations thoroughly enough before dismissing them, so it remanded those violations back to the election committee for reconsideration. After reconsidering the matter, the elections committee declined to issue any more violation points. Those that had brought up the violations appealed again to the ASUCD Court and the court asked for the parties involved to prepare briefs. Before they could hear the case, the ASUCD Court changed their mind and stated that they would not hear any more appeals on the matter. Rumor has it that LEADs threat of a lawsuit against the university caused Larry Vanderhoef to pressure the ASUCD Court to drop the matter.

By the Fall of 2001, students were more angry than ever at Bledsoe. The television show Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher came to UC Davis and held an untelevised version of the show in the UC Davis Rec Hall. One of the panelists was Tiqula Bledsoe. As Maher introduced the first panelists, the 2,000 member audience politely applauded. But as soon as Maher introduced Bledsoe, the audience erupted with a resounding BOOOOO! that lasted for nearly a minute. Maher responded, Wow! Well have to hear what YOU did!

Sacramento State L.E.A.D.
Slightly related, in an apparent attempt to copy L.E.A.D. at UC Davis, Sacramento State students established their own slate called L.E.A.D. (Leadership, Empowerment, Action, Determination).  It is unknown when this slate originated and its connection with L.E.A.D. at UC Davis.
