 To facilitate organization of this page, and to be fair to other Wiki users, please use this discussion section for questions and comments. Thanks! 

 More Support for the Student Music and Art Scene 
      what, the coffee house isnt close enough to the dorms?  Users/arlenabraham arlen
      The coffee house is a great close venue, however student could use more of these. JimSchwab
        Supporting the renovation of the Varsity Theater into a multiuse music and movie venue.
      Why could students use more venues? This sounds like more construction in a school nicknamed Under Construction Daily. If you guys are looking to spend money, why cant it be on more practical uses of land, like parking lots?  Users/jessesingh jesse
      We wish to continue in the great UCD tradition of construction....actually we would achieve this by; turning existing buildings into new venues(the Old Firehouse, which in its self is a cool name for a venue), as well as making current venues cheaper for student organized activities (ARC, Freeborn)Users/JimSchwab
 $tudent Money for the $tudent$ 
       I dont buy this. Money doesnt float around here, it gets spent. Im pretty sure all of TAPS profits go to pay TAPS employees, help run the unit, etc. Also its not money for the students, its money for the students in clubs. What if I dont want to join any clubs? What percentage of students are in clubs?  Users/arlenabraham arlen
             There are 400+ registered student groups on campus, with each group having anywhere from 5 to 80 students. You dont have to join a club and may utilize your ASUCD fees through many places; KDVS, the CoHo, Unitrans, Bike Barn,  etc.Users/JimSchwab

 Help Student Groups Help Themselves 
        Isnt this what Building Roles does?  Users/arlenabraham arlen
            Are we suppose to boycott them? Users/JimSchwab

 Bringing ASUCD into the 21st Century 
   Good idea, but youll need some way to protect the computers without a CRC there watching them. Locking stuff down discourages theft, but not vandalism.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
         We made it past the first hurdle, Alex Park, who is willing to work with us.Users/JimSchwab
   As far as I can tell, there are two ways to do this: 1) get a junxion box for $700 ea, retrofit the bus to power the box, get a verizon or cingular GPRS card for $99 ea and then pay $60/mo ea for 135kbs service. This isnt really fast enough for more than 5 or so people. 2) Get Cingular or Verizon (probably the former because we have a contract with them) to do the WAN for us. I have no idea how much this costs, but I would guess it would be expensive. Buses would still have to be outfited with wireless devices.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
       Thanks!Users/JimSchwab
   You should also talk to my roommate about this, Users/RyanCastellucci.  I believe his company has a high gain antenna that can receive wireless internet throughout Davis. Users/BrentLaabs
   Aria Communications We approched Unitrans about doing this on the P/Q line for free and were turned down. The plan was to serve WiFi out with a small web cache and cellular internet service with some a custom setup. The hardware is around $300$350 per unit, plus data service from a celular provider. We also wanted to test out a GPS feed on that hardware to allow the busses to be tracked. Users/RyanCastellucci

 Educate not Dictate 

   Im sure lots of people will come to these... Give it a try, just dont spend my money on it.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
        Many people outside of ASUCD have requested these, so there appears to be a demand. The costs are minimal, basically the costs of the flyers. We will try to keep costs low however but using the wiki, lj, myspace, facebook, listservs, and class presentations.Users/JimSchwab

 Protecting Student Rights 
    This seems like something that is out of the scope of ASUCD. It would be a good thing for the Liason to work on, but doesnt strike me as a platform issue.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
      Advocating for student rights, especially on a local level is definitely within the scope of ASUCD. The liaison can work on general issues, but the Senate must take a stance in order for the liaison to officially work on a specific issue...red tape.Users/JimSchwab
    Hold more Know Your Rights Forums where a student can learn how to respect law enforcement as well as exercise their rights.
     Good idea, but again, Im not sure people have time to attend forms. Perhaps make little if you get arrested, or get a noise violation, or searched, or stoped by the police cards, cards.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
          At past forums cards were handed out. Students have time to attend these events when they are coupled with regular group meeting times as well as held in the evening. Past forums have been successful and feedback was positive. Cards are helpful but videos and question and answer sessions work even better.Users/JimSchwab

 ASUCD Accountability 


 Institutionalize Voter Registration 
   Do you know how many students arent registered to vote? It seems like everyone i know is, but if there are indeed large numbers of nonregisterd students, this is a good idea. I think a more important task is getting people to actually vote (and do so in an educated manner), but this is significantly more difficult  Users/arlenabraham arlen
         I will look up the exact data from Davis, but on average only 18%24% of 18 to 26 yearolds are registered to vote. Of those registered to vote, less than 50% actually vote. An exception to this was the November 2004 election where 70% of registered 1826 year old UCD students voted, in part because of the election hype and the availability of early voting.Users/JimSchwab

 Improving CampusCommunity Relations 
   Isnt this the liasons job? Both the ASUCD meetings and the City Council meetings are public. If lots of senators want to discuss something with the City Council, Im sure they could get a spot on the agenda. It seems to me that youre going to have a hard time finding when 17 people can meet.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
        They have been held in the past. The council members who attended these had very positive things to say.Users/JimSchwab
  Creation of local High School Shadow Days. Work with ASUCD Pathfinder and the SRRC to bring local high school student leaders to campus to shadow campus student leaders.


 Other Comments 

  This page used to be much clearer, when it was part of L.E.A.D. and had the discussion mixed in with the platform items. Moving the discussion comments out of context makes it confusing. Users/SteveDavison
   My apologies, but I think the consensus complaint I was hearing about the page was that people were not easily following what the platform was.  I have had a lot of people ask me about the LEAD platform and I have sent them to the Wiki to find out.  I would be really disappointed if I have to start sending people to another website where the information can be clearly presented.  I am not arguing that discussion should not continue, I am just saying that a page on the platform has to clearly present the platform (as Wiki is designed to be the definitive information source of Davis).
