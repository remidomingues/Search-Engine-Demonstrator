Full Version:

With the passage of ASUCD Senate Bill #74, authored by Assagai, coauthored by Holloway, Keene, and Whitney, ASUCD voted to create the Campus Outreach and Organizing Office, the first of LEADs campus social issues. This office will be located on the first floor of the MU, across from the book store, in the space formerly occupied by the ASUCD Student Center.

The Campus Center for the Environment (CCE) (formerly the Office of Environmental Affairs) was created with the passage of ASUCD Senate Bill #76, authored by Mathison, coauthored and introduced by Kyle Keene. This office will be located in the MU basement in the Project Compost Office.

In accordance with LEADs commitment to keeping student fees low, LEAD authored and supports a Constitutional amendment that will require a 60% vote to pass any fee based initiative. ASUCD Constitutional Amendment #8, authored by Lloyd, coauthored by Assagai, Holloway, Sanchez, and Whitney, will appear on the Fall 2005 ASUCD election ballot.

LEAD supported giving ASUCD Senate the ability to censure its members for misconduct.  ASUCD Senate Bill #73, authored by independent candidate and current ASUCD Senator Eric Fox, coauthored by Keene, Avi Singh (Independent), and Whitney, accomplishes LEADs campaign promise to bring more accountability to ASUCD public officials.

In order to increase the power of student voters within the Davis community, LEAD promised to advocate for Choice Voting in the City of Davis.  The advocacy efforts were led by the Davis College Green Party Davis College Greens before LEAD was involved in the effort. LEAD senators, President and Vice President, as well as Friends Urging Campus Kindness senators, assisted the Davis College Greens in their advocacy effort. As a result of our collective advocacy, the implementation of Choice Voting in the City of Davis will go to the voters on the June 2006 Ballot.

LEAD supported advocating for lower text book prices through a special committee of the senate. ASUCD Senate Bill #36, authored by Beeman, coauthored by Holloway and Lloyd, created the Textbook and Affordability Selection Committee (TASC). This is a special committee of the senate that will work with CalPIRG to advocate for lower text book prices or alternatives to textbooks on the UC Davis campus. Robert Baron is the newly appointed chair of the committee.

In the face of a grossly overprojected revenue from the previous years budget, Tipsy Taxis fares will be increased to $1.50 for FY0506.  To help students avoid the fee increase, Senate Bill 83, authored by Lloyd and intern Genna Carnes (now GASC Chair), will offer $5 ride coupon books good for five rides.

To bring the ASUCD Senate closer to the student body, Fall Quarter Senators Fiel and Lloyd promised to begin holding regular ASUCD Senate Forums.  Fiel, assisted by her interns, put on ASUCDs first senate forum in the Winter Quarter, entitled ASUCD vs. Diversity. In addition, the administrative plan adopted for the Campus Outreach and Organizing Office institutionalizes the practice by including it in the list of activities.

Promising to expand culture funding, ASUCD Senator Janine Fiel amended the FY0506 operating budget to increase funding for culture retreats.

The popular campaign issue for Fall LEAD senators was the concept of allowing the Environmental Policy and Planning Commission (EPPC) to perform environmental audits of ASUCD units.  Now renamed environmental assessments, this ability has been added to the ASUCD Standing rules (SB 85) and included in the commissions firstever administrative plan (SB 86), authored primarily by Karly Kauffman, EPPC Chair, with the assistance of Lloyd.

Wireless Expansion into the downtown Davis area was popularly received in the fall election campaign.  Through communication with the Davis Downtown Business Association Davis Downtown Business Associations (DDBA) Tom Lovering, Lloyd has developed a strong line of communication between the campus IET and the DDBA to ensure that the DDBAs wireless expansion efforts will remain free for students.

Campaigning for a StudentPolice liaison position, Senators Fiel and Lloyd supported the proposed Student Police Relations Committee (SPRC), ASUCD Senate Bill # 41, authored by Senator Avi Singh (independent candidate), and coauthored by Office of External Affairs Director James Schwab. Senator Lloyd assisted Singh with the implementation of the project.

In the Presidents proposed budget, Assagai increased CFC funding by two thousand dollars!

LEAD has begun working on:

 	Organizing a Rally at the Capital to highlight Californias Master Plan for Education, and call for increases funding and accessibility to the UC system.
 	Expanding the ASUCD Lobby Corps program through increased outreach efforts.
 	Making AGTV accessible in the dorms.
 	Providing printing services in Campus Copies/Classical Notes and the Cyber Lounge at the ARC.
 	Advocating for an increase in diversity among faculty on campus.

LEAD is still committed to fulfilling all of our campaign promises.  Sixtyseven percent of voters put their trust in LEAD, and LEAD has, and will continue to deliver.
