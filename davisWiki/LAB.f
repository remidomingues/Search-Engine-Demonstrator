About Our Collective
The CO/LAB is an art and design collective created by students who are trying to build a creative community at UC Davis. Students in the group come from many different areas of expertise, including design, art studio and technocultural studies. The CO/LAB began in November 2006 as UC Davis senior design student Milan Phanâ€™s brain child and has grown into a group of 35 students. The CO/LAB recently held a showcase of multimedia design work in a May exhibition.

The Co/LAB held a gallery show in the Basement Gallery of the UC Davis Art Builidng during the week of May2125, 2007. While the Co/laborators are very sad that their show closed, that doesnt mean they are done collaborating. The group plans to carry on the spirit of collaboration and hopes to make the Co/LAB a permanent Davis staple. Some of the work from the Basement Gallery show will be displayed at UNCANNY which is to be held on May 31, 2007. Additionally, meetings will be held throughout the summer with tentative plans for another gallery show sometime during the 20072008 UC Davis school year. If you are interested in joining in on the continiuing collaboration please email the Co/LAB at MailTo(thedesigncolab@gmail.com).





The set up at 10:30pm on the Saturday before opening of the May 2007 Basement Gallery Show.
