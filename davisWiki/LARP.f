LARP is an acronym for Live Action Roleplaying.  It is a type of roleplaying games roleplaying game wherein the participants take on a character, often of their own creation, and  interact with other players doing the same, thereby creating a shared story and improvisational theatre experience.

One of the most popular systems is the Storytelling system, published by White Wolf.  The system allows a group of players to work with a Storyteller to create a storyline.  The plot may be guided by the Storyteller or guided by the participants.  The story is then facilitated by the Storyteller and a group of people playing various parts that fill out the setting.  Prior to the Storytelling system, White Wolf published Minds Eye Theater, a similar system that can still be found in use. Storytellers are aided by Narrators, who assist in running stories in the game.

 International Chronicles 

No large scale chronicles meet regularly within Davis, but people in Davis looking to play in a world wide setting have a few regionally active options:

The nearest http://owbn.org/ One World by Night chronicles are in Stockton (whose vampires lays claim to Davis within the game or at least they did several years ago), Sacramento and Oakland.  There are also games in wiki:chico Chico and Auburn.

The nearest regular http://camarilla.whitewolf.com/ Camarilla chapter is in Sacramento, the http://www.strangebed.jwmedia.net/ Strange Bedfellows domain.   There appears to be no domain claimed that covers Davis, but ingame activity can still occur here.  Should anybody in Davis playing in the Cam need an east coast contact, Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards and Users/SarahEdwards are both VSTs and players active in Requiem, Awakened, Forsaken and Lost chronicles in Pennsylvania and occasionally neighboring states.

A new http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf:_The_Apocalypse Werewolf Chronicle by the http://mindseyesociety.org Minds Eye Society is starting on Week A Saturdays from 1pm5pm at Mace Ranch East Park.  Initial game is on March 22nd, 2014.

 History 
The first Davis LARP was a Vampire: the Masquerade game entitled Underground Puppeteers Underground Puppeteers (nicknamed the Underpup game), founded by Bill Albertson (Storyteller) and Users/KentWhittington Kent Whittington (Head Narrator) on Sept. 13, 1996.  Underground Puppeteers lasted for nearly two years, and in that time saw two new StoryTellers (Users/RichardCrawford Richard Crawford and Keith Phemister) and a rotation of approximately 60 players (although the core group at most times numbered about 25).  It was played at the Death Star Death Star for a year before moving to Mansion Square Mansion Square, but ultimately returned to the Death Star Death Star before ending in early 1998.  A 10th anniversary game was held September 15th, 2006 featuring characters from all the various games sporting the Underground Puppeteers Underground Puppeteers banner.

The second Vampire: the Masquerade LARP present in Davis was founded by Michelle Booher and Jon Martz in June of 1997, and was called Second Progeny Underground Puppeteers: Second Progeny and nicknamed 2P.  Due to mature story themes, the original Underground Puppeteers Underground Puppeteers staff restricted its player base to individuals aged 17 and over, but realized that a need existed for a game tailored to younger participants when it came out that a number of players had lied about their ages to be allowed in.  Wanting to allow younger gamers to participate, but understanding that younger gamers might not have the emotional maturity to handle stronger themes (and respecting that even the players who could handle them might have parents who would object to their exposure), Second Progeny Second Progeny allowed a range of players from 1325 and placed PG13 restrictions on the story and game elements.  Users/AdamBlackman Adam Blackman became StoryTeller for Second Progeny in September of 1998 and continued in that role until the games conclusion in 2002.  As independent LARPs go, Second Progeny Second Progeny was wildly popular, drawing over 100 players throughout its run and participants from as far away as Rocklin and Alameda.  A sequel 2P2: Millennium 2P2 Millennium ran briefly in September 2005 as an invitationonly venture by Users/EdGylesJr Ed Gyles Jr..

During the run of Second Progeny Second Progeny, several other LARPs began and/or ended.  Reign In Blood Reign In Blood was another teenoriented Vampire game, running on Saturday mornings; Tooth and Claw Tooth and Claw was another adultoriented game played on Saturday nights.  Cataclysm Cataclysm was a longrunning Werewolf game (19982000) managed by Users/JoaquinChavez Joaquin Chavez with an abortive 2003 continuation, Terrible Certainty Terrible Certainty, resurrected in name as a current oldstyle Minds Eye Theatre MET Vampire LARP.  And the original Underground Puppeteers Underground Puppeteers was briefly revived three times, with the last permutation forming the foundation of a longrunning game in Sacramento.

Following the end of Second Progeny Second Progeny, Users/AdamBlackman Adam Blackman started a Changeling game called Book of Dreams Book of Dreams, which lasted two years and is credited with spawning into the two separate and unrelated Changeling games Dreamers Ball Dreamers Ball (Which ran from 2004, covering 3 different historical periods and 2 different game systems.  It finally completed its storyline in 2008 with Storyteller Users/JaredThaler Jared Thaler) and Glitz and Glamour Glitz and Glamour (ended 2005).  A Vampire: the Dark Ages game known as Dark Past The Dark Past (run by Users/JoaquinChavez JoaquinChavez) had several short runs in 20032005.  Silent Throne Silent Throne (another Changeling LARP) and Frailty Frailty (a Werewolf game) both founded by Users/ErikBerman Erik Bob Berman and later passed to other StoryTellers (Users/MartinPresley Martin Presley and Users/TimSmith Tim Smith respectively) had strong multiyear runs, but finally ended in 2006.  One Vampire: the Requiem game, Users/MementoMori Memento Mori (hosted by Users/AdamBlackman Adam Blackman and Users/ErinManley Erin Manley) had a shortlived run in 2006, and the Werewolf game Nightfall Nightfall hosted by Users/JoaquinChavez Joaquin Chavez moved to a tabletop format in 2006 as well.  The Changeling game SticksandStones Sticks and Stones by Users/AdamBlackman Adam Blackman and Users/ErinManley Erin Manley) also moved to tabletop format in 2008.

During this time, The staff and players of Dreamers Ball were invited to take part in White Wolfs play testing of the new MET: The Awakening system as part of White Wolfs outreach efforts to get feedback from nonCammarila gaming groups.  As a result, Gates of Gold was formed, with a limited participation, as a playtest run.  With the end of the Playtest period, Gates of Gold was opened to the public, but its size was limited by its small venue size.  As of May 2008, Gates of Gold returned to the Death Star Death Star and is once again an open game, using the MET: the Awakening corebook published in 2008.

Several groups have run sites dedicated to tracking the various LARP games in Davis, including the defunct Penny Dreadful Penny Dreadful and Black Clad Gaming Black Clad Gaming groups and the http://www.davislarp.,com DavisLARP website.  Currently, http://larp.davisgames.com DavisGames provides an online hub and forum/wiki space for the local liveaction gaming community.
