20100331 23:30:27 nbsp Hi LC, and Welcome to the Wiki!  If youre looking for a new dentist, I recommend Sang Tran, DDS Dr. Tran in North Davis or Dagon H.C. Jones, DDS Dr. Jones in East Davis.  Ive been to Dr. Tran a number of times and had great experiences (Dr. Wong, who shares office space with Dr. Tran, is also great).  While I havent been to Dr. Jones personally, Ive heard glowing reviews from a couple of friends, and hes very active and endlessly helpful here on the wiki.  The marvelous Dental Questions page is his doing. Also, while youre here, why no introduce yourself?  You can edit this page to add some info.  Have a look at the Importance of using your RealName page.  It really is conducive to a quality community experience. Users/TomGarberson
