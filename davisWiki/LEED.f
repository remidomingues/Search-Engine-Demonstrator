LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a sustainability certification system developed by http://www.usgbc.org U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for verifying that a building, home or community was designed and built using strategies aimed at achieving high performance in key areas of human and environmental health: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality.

UC Davis has http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/progress/buildings/map.html several buildings which are LEED certified, some at the highest level: Platinum. Additionally, all new buildings at UC Davis are required to meet standards equivalent to LEED Silver certification. Currently LEED certified or registered buildings can be found on the http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/sustainability/ sustainability map of campus.   The LEED for Homes certifications are also reviewed here in town by the Davis Energy Group.

More information on LEED can be found http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID1988 here on the http://www.usgbc.org USGBC website.

LEED should not be confused with LEAD, the once and future ASUCD student government slate, although Dan Xie some of Ravi Deepak their candidates Users/BrentLaabs/Issues have campaigned on getting more LEED certified buildings on campus.
