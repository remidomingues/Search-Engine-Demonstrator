Volunteers help make many of the programs and services offered by the UC Davis Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Resource Center possible. Volunteers assist with various projects including updating resources, compiling program evaluations, advertising events, and supporting existing programs such as TransAction Week and Safe Zone.

If you are interested in volunteering regularly, please read on to learn more about our Volunteer Office Assistant program:

Volunteer Office Assistants have regular office hours and commit to working at the center for at least two hours a week. Transcript notation and 199 research units are also available. Please note that in order to receive transcript notation, you must volunteer for a minimum of four hours per week.

Below is a list of some sample tasks that Volunteer Office Assistants can help with. Volunteers can choose what types of tasks they are interested in and comfortable with (so if tabling or answering phones isn’t quite your thing, don’t worry).

Sample Tasks for Office Assistants:
 Updating mailing lists
 Creating a welcoming space at the center by greeting visitors as they come in
 Giving tours of the center to newcomers
 Tabling at events
 Data entry/inputting evaluations into database
 Emailing reminders to folks to return overdue library materials

 And more!
