 LUGOD To Celebrate 15th Birthday 
 Join us on Monday, January 20th, 2014 at 7pm at the Veterans Memorial Center (Club Room), as we celebrate our 15th birthday with food, cake, giveaway prizes, and a presentation on http://www.gluster.org/ GlusterFS (an open source, distributed file system capable of scaling to several petabytes (actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands of clients.).

 Linux Users Group of Davis 
 LUGOD stands for Linux Users Group of Davis.  From their website, they are a 501(c)(7) nonprofit computer club serving Davis, California and the Sacramento area. We are a collection of over 400 people dedicated to GNU/Linux ^TM^ (a powerful, free, Unixlike operating system), Free Software, Open Source, and other related topics.

What a night! http://www.lugod.org/10 LUGOD turned 10 at our January 19, 2009 meeting!  Many got free pizza, snacks, birthday cake, giveaways and raffle prizes.  We enjoyed a presentation by Allison Randal, chief architect of Parrot.  7pm at the Davis Public Library.  (Heres a http://lugod.org/documents/flyers/lugod_parrot_200901.pdf Flyer (PDF))

 LUGOD has about 100 active members, and meeting attendance anywhere in the 10 to 60 range, depending on the topic. Many travel from outside Davis to attend, and a far smaller percentage of members are students than you might expect. Not surprisingly, it includes a fair swath of Davis sysadmin population. They work to promote Linux among the towns population, including but not limited to the student population. They maintain active mailing lists and a semiactive IRC channel (#lugod) on http://freenode.net/ FreeNode.net.

 Activities of note to residents 
  Meetings and Social Gatherings 
  Their http://www.lugod.org/meetings meetings are held on first Tuesday and third Monday of the each month as of 200708, thirdMonday events are general meetings with guest speakers, and are usually held at the Davis Branch Library Davis public library and include a technical or nontechnical presentation. FirstTuesday meetings are social gatherings, usually held at Crepeville. (Be sure to check http://lugod.org their website before you come, sometimes the location gets moved around to another location, such as Sudwerk.)  Note that as of 2013, apparently no one is in charge of running the social gathering; be prepared to socialize with the other fellow looking lost in the middle of the restaurant.  Or with yourself.

  Installfests 
  They used to hold Linux installfest workshops (http://www.lugod.org/if), usually held on Campus campus, at which people have Linux installed on their systems by volunteers. They are running sort of short of these volunteers (email MailTo(if@lugod.org) if you would like to help), and they seem to feel that there are enough userfriendly distros out there that you should be able to do it yourself. More information at http://www.lugod.org/if/help. (Note: Installfest days sometimes change, depending on volunteer/coordinator availability.)

  Handson Linux Demos 
  They occasionally have handson demos, so that people who havent tried Linux yet can take it for a test drive. Freebies and informative handouts are often given out at these events.

  Conferences and Other Events 
  LUGOD has participated in a number of events, including the Whole Earth Festival and the California 4H Clubs 4H conference at UC Davis, LinuxWorld Expo in San Francisco, the Government Technology Conference in Sacramento, and more.  In April 2008, LUGOD participated in the Yolo County Child Development Conference.

  Internet Kiosks 
  They helped construct Public Internet Terminals public internet terminals at Newsbeat, the Davis Food Coop (which were maintained by DCN the Davis Community Network and Omsoft), and Chamonix. All have since been removed from operation.

 History 
 LUGOD was founded in January, 1999. A http://www.lugod.org/documents/history/beginning.txt post to the ucd.life Usenet newsgroup, made one month earlier by cofounder Pete Salzman, prompted the formation. The clubs website contains http://www.lugod.org/meeting/past/ meeting minutes, copies of http://www.lugod.org/presentations/ presentations and http://www.lugod.org/photos/ photos from many meetings. Mailing lists are publicly archived as well.

 In the past, LUGOD worked with the Computer Science Club at UC Davis to host Installfest installfests, but in recent years have run them alone.  A number of groups were started by people involved with LUGOD, such as ZUGOD Davis Plone Users Group and the CVBIG, the Central Valley Bioinformatics Interest Group. LUGOD has also been involved with the other local Linux user groups: http://www.saclug.org/ SacLUG in Sacramento and RoseLUG in Roseville.

 On January 19, 2009, the LUGOD 10th anniversary meeting ended with the police arriving as a member of LUGOD triggered the alarm after being locked in the library as the meeting was disbanding.


20080415 20:51:53 nbsp How does LUGOD feel about BSD? Users/VinceBuffalo
 Opinions vary, but many members are supporters of anything thats Free and Open Source, in fact quite a few also run various BSD machines. Users/AlexMandel

     It is now official. Netcraft has confirmed: BSD is dying

    One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered BSD community when IDC confirmed that BSD market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all servers. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that BSD has lost more market share, this news serves to reinforce what weve known all along. BSD is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last samag.com in the recent Sys Admin comprehensive networking test.

    You dont need to be the Amazing Kreskin amazingkreskin.com to predict BSDs future. The hand writing is on the wall: BSD faces a bleak future. In fact there wont be any future at all for BSD because BSD is dying. Things are looking very bad for BSD. As many of us are already aware, BSD continues to lose market share. Red ink flows like a river of blood.

    FreeBSD is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its core developers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time FreeBSD developers Jordan Hubbard and Mike Smith only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: FreeBSD is dying.

    Lets keep to the facts and look at the numbers.

    OpenBSD leader Theo states that there are 7000 users of OpenBSD. How many users of NetBSD are there? Lets see. The number of OpenBSD versus NetBSD posts on Usenet is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 7000/5  1400 NetBSD users. BSD/OS posts on Usenet are about half of the volume of NetBSD posts. Therefore there are about 700 users of BSD/OS. A recent article put FreeBSD at about 80 percent of the BSD market. Therefore there are (7000+1400+700)4  36400 FreeBSD users. This is consistent with the number of FreeBSD Usenet posts.

    Due to the troubles of Walnut Creek, abysmal sales and so on, FreeBSD went out of business and was taken over by BSDI who sell another troubled OS. Now BSDI is also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel house.

    All major surveys show that BSD has steadily declined in market share. BSD is very sick and its long term survival prospects are very dim. If BSD is to survive at all it will be among OS dilettante dabblers. BSD continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save it at this point in time. For all practical purposes, BSD is dead.

  What about Red Hat?  Why do Google searches necessarily correlate with number of users?
