  30 Day minimum rental

  7x8 (smallest): $55/mo + $25 application fee + $20 key deposit

  They want you to pay the first and last months rents up front.

Bonus  This self storage storage facilty is freakishly close to campus (over by the Domes), a plus for any outgoing freshmen who need to leave some stuff in Davis for the summer.

 
   Stuff!  If you got too much and you want to keep it, you need one of the storage units in Davis!



Im pretty sure this place is (or at least used to be) called Russell Park Storage. I rented from them last summer and thats the name that they went by. Somebody want to double check? Users/AbbyLawson
