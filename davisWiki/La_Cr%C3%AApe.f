La Crêpe is great if you want a crêpe from a real Frenchman, as the owner is from France. Though housed in the The Silo it is not run by Sodexho but is a small rendition of what the crepe bistro used to be, minus the soup. The owner of La Crêpe used to own the Crepe Bistro, and at least one other employee is a past Bistro employee as well. Prices mainly range from $2.25 for a simple sugar & butter crêpe to $6.95 for the hearty Poulet Provençal. First of all, you can choose a Breakfast Crêpe, a Daily Specials crêpe, a Make Your Own crêpe, or a Dessert Crêpe! (exciting isnt it?) In addition to the type of crêpe, be prepared to tell them whether you want a white or wheat crêpe upon ordering, if you want jack, swiss, or cheddar cheese, and what type of sauce youd like (pesto, mornay, or curry). Most of La Crepes #savory savory crepes are available ovo/lacto vegetarian style, but both the mornay and curry sauces are prepared with chicken broth & white wine.

A crêpe has been described as a tortilla that has a consistency similar to a pancake and has been folded and filled with various goodies.  An alternate description would be a really thin omelet with lots of flour mixed into it to create a eggy soft wrap.  Depending on the filling, they can be sweet or savory.

  Sugar and Butter ($2.50)

Prices corrected as of mid 2008.


A bit expensive for breakfast, but the people are nice and the food isnt bad.  Try an Orangina while youre there.

I recommend the Florentine or the Coq au Vin crepes. Or, if you prefer, any of the omelette ones are good.  Users/AndreyGoder

My fav Crêpe place in Davis, IMO better than Crepeville or even the now defunct Crepe Bistro.  Spinach and/or broccoli and/or mushrooms crêpes with swiss cheese and mornay sauce were my favorites.  Users/JevanGray

I recently tried Bacon, Jack, Avocado, and Mornay Sauce  YUM! But I miss the cool guys behind the counter :(  LizaAbeja

I personally prefer the crêpe cart (also referred to by its formal name La Crêpe) to Crepeville any day...but hey, thats just me.  Users/JulieLujano

I HIGHLY recommend Alains Avocado crepe. Its fantastic. Users/AnnaHamilton

20051020 10:09:59 nbsp I like Crepevilles hours and coffee refills (ooh theres an idea for a page), but the Crepe Cart is amazing.  Although I have few reasons to go on campus since graduation, this eatery is perhaps the best one I can think ofat least around lunch time. Users/JaimeRaba

20051020 13:00:04 nbsp Im a fan of the Kathmandu crepe too. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060308 16:21:11 nbsp I love the french kiss... I just wish they heat it a lil longer so alllll the chocolate melts Users/JoAnnaRich

20060602 01:22:06 nbsp The Kathmandu crepe is what ive blown almost all my pseudocash on. It is delicious... Users/PaulArden

20070413 19:16:43 nbsp I missed Crepe Bistro, and was so glad I found them here.  Delicious! Users/EdHenn

20070508 11:28:00 nbsp If the owner is there watch out, he wont let you get weird crepes as it is insulting to his style of food. By weird I mean ingredients that wouldnt normally be seen as going together. Users/StevenDaubert

20070926 16:49:38 nbsp I have never had an onion soup as delicious as the one they used to have at Crepe Bistro.  They should bring the recipe over here. Users/CalamityJanie

20070929 12:11:54 nbsp I agree that the French Onion Soup from Crepe Bistro was some of the best.  Great idea to bring it over. Users/CJSD

20080318 23:16:57 nbsp Deelish. While its not the healthiest thing you can get, its also one of the few places in the Silo that doesnt come deepfried and dripping in oil. Ask for wheat crepes! The guy who works the cash register is so happy and friendly.  Users/RoseRed

20080506 01:08:32 nbsp The Florentine crepe is really good . . . and pretty filling :) Users/phyrephox

20080511 22:03:10 nbsp These crepes are damn delicious! Especially since Im a veggie maniac, Woowho! Go wheat! I just dont get the tall guy sometimes who is very loud...his voice is very deep when he screams customers names and then it becomes very high like a little girl when he says enjoy! Order the Ratatouille with feta cheese. Its amazing! Just like that mexican guy with the hair net. The asian guy is funny too...he reminds me of the old little chef in the movie Ratatouille. Users/LupeDaya

20080519 21:23:49 nbsp I enjoy the crepes here, but mostly it is the outgoing staff that makes this place special.  I recommend the pesto tomato crepe...  Users/BradKern

20080529 08:21:09 nbsp Anyone know if they stay open during summer? Users/EdHenn
   20080606 23:34:37 nbsp I think if they are open, it would be during the summer sessions only. Users/LupeDaya
    Both summer sessions?  Users/StevenDaubert
       20080609 21:05:51 nbsp I guess well have to wait and see...I know Im going to see if their open. Its worth Users/LupeDaya

20091006 17:00:56 nbsp I tried the La Crepe for the fist time today during lunch. I ordered a simple tomato, onion, and cheese crepe. And i have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical at first since its a crepe place in a university dining hall (next to Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, etc), but the crepe was as authentic as the ones I used to love scattered around the les boulevards de Paris. Next time Im getting une crepe avec du citron et du sucre, cest magnifique! Users/ben8jam

20091015 13:00:09 nbsp Just had a coq au vin crepe. Delicious. Highly recommended :). Users/Keegano

20091027 19:28:12 nbsp DELICIOUS! I love it way better than crepeville.  The people who run this place are super nice.  If I could, I would eat here everyday.  You have to try something with the mornay sauce.  It is amazing! Users/Larissa

20091028 14:47:01 nbsp I had the Crepe Dujour, a crepe with pesto sauce, chicken, and tomatoes. Other than it being absolutely delightful, the service was fantastic. The guys working there are great. Users/syxxshooter

20091103 17:34:03 nbsp The crepes here are very good.  And the big white guy is funny.

A+++++++ would buy again Users/JackWaller

20091205 23:02:27 nbsp My experience with crêpes before this place was limited to Crepeville and Crepe House Uni. This place is just so much better. The actual crêpes themselves are just so tasty. The savory fillings and sauces are mouthwatering as well.

I have had
  Kathmandu
  Lemon
  Sugar and butter
  Poulet Provencal
  Florentine

All of these were winners.

I think my main complaint about the place is price. A savory crêpe and a bottle of Orangina (which is highly recommended, btw) will put you back about $10. Still, its worth it.
 Users/WilliamLewis
 They havent raised prices in two years  Users/StevenDaubert
  Good to know. wl )
  Probably because theres not much room to go up :P users/edwins ES

20091207 18:03:54 nbsp Id recommend this place. The crepes are delicious, quite filling and the staff are friendly. Users/CraigEasdale

20100116 20:23:16 nbsp Absolutely the most delicious strawberry crepe. Im not a student and I pay for parking during the day just to go to the crepe cart!  Users/LeeY

20100211 13:39:57 nbsp Pretty tasty.  I had their Spinach Special.  It was way more dense than I expected, so I guess that means it is a good deal :)  Theres a Davis Wiki sticker on the register.  Nice. I recommend avoiding the noontime rush and snack on something until about 1:30.  Then you wont be waiting in a crazy long line (maybe). Users/RyanMikulovsky

20100304 13:00:48 nbsp my experience with the butter and sugar crepe was good. but i recently got the spinach special. the spinach felt like it was thawed from frozen spinach. the cheese was just overwhelming and was so fattening and the crepe was soggy. i was so disappointed and upset for a 7 dollar crepe. i am probably never coming here again. Users/chand3123k

20100318 14:34:53 nbsp The omelette crepes here are really really good... though they are a little pricy... and the last time i went there they got my order completely wrong... still recommend it though. Users/olwright

20100327 16:36:38 nbsp I LOOOOOOVVVEEEEEE la crepe!!! the food is AMAZING and the customer service GREAT! the young guy that comes on at 11 is the BEST! he recommended me to try the Ratatouille crepe with chicken and now im addicted! it is as if im in paris eating an authentic French crepe. Trust me, once you try this place, youll fall in love ) Users/dmp

20100415 15:47:16 nbsp Amazing crepes and an even better customer service!! I ordered my crepes to go, and they gave me a can of whipped cream for free!! Dont expect to get a free can of whipped cream every visit, but you will get great crepes every time!! Users/JeffreySusila

20100504 19:21:18 nbsp YUM. delicious!  Wish they had more of the Crepe bistro menu including the quiche and salads. Looking forward to going back again and again.  Users/HeatherMartin

20100520 11:18:17 nbsp The mushroom and cheese crepe is absolutely amazing. I want to thank all the guys at the crepe cart and let them know that what theyre doing is awesome. Props to Daubert for bringing a chill vibe to the place! Users/timchin

20101103 12:56:30 nbsp Daubert came by the Baytel office and let us sample some of the crepes.  Ive been hooked like a meth addict ever since.  Best crepes in town....no contest. Users/aroach12

20110317 13:16:20 nbsp Im a big fan of the Ratatouille and strawberry crepes and the friendly service. Gourmet lunch!  You guys always crack me up too! Thanks for cheering up my day! Users/DerekDowney

20130226 09:27:28 nbsp This place is absolutely amazing! I normally do the create your own Crepe option with Jack Cheese, Avocado, and Chicken  yum! The people who work here are really nice and friendly, and the crepes themselves are always delicious. Although it may appear a bit pricy, the crepes are very filling. Ive even eaten half for one meal then had to save the rest for later. If you havent stopped by La Crepe in the Silo yet, Id highly recommend it. Users/MaggyRyan
