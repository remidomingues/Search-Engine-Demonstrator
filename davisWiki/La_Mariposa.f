It looks like a good one from the outside, we werent able to stop in but will soon enough.  Coming off Highway 113 into Woodland, its the first Thrift Stores thrift shop on your left.


This store is a great find if you have little ones.  They seem to cater to childrens clothing.


This store is closed!
