20100106 06:30:21 nbsp Welcome to La Quinta!  The hotel is has recieved a muchdeserved facelift, with new furniture, high definition televisions with direct tv, carpeting, and laminate wood flooring in the lobby. Still the same management and owners, so we hope to see our old friends come by again soon! Users/Flynn

20100601 17:34:24 nbsp This place is great. I love the friendly staff and the new rooms are amazing. They are under renovation but when they finish the place it will be the second nicest place in town. (Hyatt is #1) I always have my friends and family stay at this hotel and would suggest it to anyone as it is truly the best value in town. Users/JoeRandom

20120208 02:31:00 nbsp I am so pleased with my decision to switch over from the Comfort Suites Hotel to La Quinta. The General Manager, Melissa is so much more respectful to me. I am so much more relaxed here, and feel more welcome. I have some cognitive, memory problems now as a Senior Citizen,and they have been very patient, and understanding about that. I have a much better view to here on the 3rd floor, the view is awesome of big tall trees,compared to the bushes, and parking lot I had a view of at the Comfort Suites Hotel. I feel confident the management will not enter my room without my permission except in case of a legitimate reason to check on my safety, or the physical safety of the room, such as a flood, or fire. It brings back good memories of when I was in Oregon.  Users/deals911
