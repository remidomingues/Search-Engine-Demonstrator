20050415 17:12:51 nbsp a few things. 1) dont be afraid to use your real name, it gives you more crediblity. 2) remember to preview before saving. saving repeatedley ties up the server with unnessary backup versions of the page. 3) events usually go on the events board. be sure to add your event there. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050424 19:04:42 nbsp I second the first suggestion. Users/JackHaskel

20050424 21:05:58 nbsp Thanks for the suggestions.  Since this is a page representing the committee organizing this event  I wanted to keep it general and easy to find among the pages by the name of the event.  Ive also added it to the events page.  Users/LaRazaCulturalDays

20050424 22:22:06 nbsp Might I suggest having this as a general page for the La Raza Culture Days? Its important that we have such a page anyways and this seems like a start. Itd rename the page and add spaces to it. Then Id rename myself and start editing that page. Past history and a little synopsis of the event would be good. So would pictures and a review of this years event once it happens. Check out the Whole Earth Festival page as an example. Users/JackHaskel

20050424 23:03:20 nbsp why is it called cultural days if its only one day long? Users/ArlenAbraham

20050425 16:28:28 nbsp La Raza Cultural Days is actually a whole week long.  During this week we have various programs relating to the latino culture and community.  However, la gran tardeada is the culmination of the week long celebration and is the most family friendly.  This page was meant to advertise the tardeada because it is the highlight of the week because it has so many features.  As for elaborating on the page that sounds like a great idea and ill work on it.   Users/LaRazaCulturalDays

20050425 16:31:41 nbsp Oh...Im kind of new at this so i had a question.  Can I rename the page without having to make a new one? And how can i rename myself so people know Im editing the page but dont think that I am not the sole organizer of this event?  Users/LaRazaCulturalDays

20050425 17:38:07 nbsp rename the page by going to edit, then rename (theres a button below and to the left of the editing box). to rename yourself, just log out and create a new user account using your real name. Users/ArlenAbraham

20080131 17:14:18 nbsp Why do Native Americans and Latinos each have their own separate set of cultural days? The vast majority of socalled Latinos are predominantly of Native American descent. They are just as much of Indians as the Natives of the U.S. The only big difference between the two is that one group was conquered by the Anglos, the other by the Spaniards. Excluding White and Black Latinos, Latinos and Native Americans are one people, so shouldnt they just combine both cultural days into one big event? It could possibly be called Indigenous American Cultural Days. Let the White Latinos (i.e. Cubans, Argentines, Spaniards) have there own set of festivities. Also, this year better have more events that focus on Indigenous culture. It would be a shame if this years Latino Cultural Days didnt focus on Indians when so many Latinos (especially Xicanos!) are overhwhelmingly of Indian descent. Users/Maitl

20080131 19:47:36 nbsp Yes there are similarities, butNative American culture is not the same as Latin@/Chican@ culture. Its like saying African culture and AfricanAmerican culture are the same because they share common ancestry. Simple as that. Users/MattBlair
