They work on issues of discrimination such as race, religion, and sex affecting Latin@ and other disadvantaged communities. La Raza PreLaw is a nonprofit Student Organizations student organization with a progressive agenda that seeks to protect and advance the civil rights of individuals who are underrepresented while undergraduates undergrads at the UC Davis University of California, Davis and in respective communities. La Raza PreLaw also seeks to bring about positive change by addressing legal issues dealing with, but not limited to immigration, schools education, Medical Services healthcare, and employment issues. LRPSA works to promote and sustain the Academic Help academic success of any prospective law student at UC Davis.
