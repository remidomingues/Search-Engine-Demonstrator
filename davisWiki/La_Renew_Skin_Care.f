20120529 21:21:49 nbsp 20120529  I am so glad Lisa has decided to stay in Davis.  I have been through a lot of waxers and skin specialists in my life, and she is just the best.  Quick, painless, knowledgeable, and nice.  I have seen her for four years and would follow her anywhere.  She is particularly good with women who are not so young, because she really understands how skin work.  You will be relieved and happy; really. Users/PatriciaNelson
