20120121 08:43:45 nbsp PLEASE READ BEFORE CONSIDERING THIS PLACE!

Let me start off by saying that I know times are hard and money is tight for many students and their families, the last problem you would want is to have an unpleasant living situation. I have lived in five different apartment complexes in Davis, and this one was by far the worse. Im very easy going and have almost nothing to complain about my previous residencies. During signing period, the manager Carlos and his staff presented themselves as the friendliest people I have ever come across. Shortly after I found out that this was all an acting job to lure me into signing a lease. After you sign your lease, EVERYTHING GOES DOWNHILL. I can count on one hand the number of times I went to pick up a package from the office, and each time they were rude and gave me funny looks. Same thing for the two times I needed a repair. However, I will say the maintenance staff are very prompt and genuinely friendly. They acknowledge and greet me every time they see me, the polar opposite of the office staff. Then renewal and signing period emerges, I started getting the friendly office staff once again. They offering snacks and coffee in the office to supposedly help students through Finals. This is all just a facade to get you to sign the dotted line. Dont fall for it. Dont get stuck in a miserable 1 year lease over $2 worth of cookies and coffee. They will try anything to get you to sign, posting flyers on your door, pestering you every time they see you, sending out emails, etc. I was walking across the street and Carlos honked at me, and then pulled down his window to tell me only a few left, if you want it sign now. Another time I was watching TV in the lounge and the short lady with the glasses came up to me and started small talk with me, and was trying to convince me renew. In my head I was just thinking, why arent you so nice when I actually need your assistance? My neighbors have told me stories just like this and were calling Carlos all sorts of names. And for the amount of rent that this place charges, you dont get what you pay for. The appliances are older than most of the college students and the rooms are very small compared to other places in Davis. Around June, La Salle sent out flyers offering residents extra money on top of their deposit if they move out early. This was obviously done to make more time for them to fix the apartments for the upcoming tenants. I was not interested because I needed to stay for the remainder of my leasing period. Heres the part that upset me the most about La Salle. During the last few weeks, they were constantly finding loopholes to get into my apartment to do renovations, such as replacing the sink and doing some touch up work on the walls. These things were in perfect working condition, and I had no complaints. My question is why did they wait until my lease is almost up? Why not earlier? It was not to help the current resident(me), it was selfish and unprofessional on their part to interfere with my time here to do renovations for the next resident. And on the last day of the lease, they showed up half an hour early for my move out inspection. I told the lady with the glasses, I wish to use the time left to do some last minute cleaning and she gave me attitude. Finally my deposit check came to me about 1 month later, and I got  25% of what I paid originally. I left the carpet and walls flawless so I definitely got ripped off. But hey what can I say, that was no surprise to me at that point.

By the way, when I read this wiki page during my apartment searching, I noticed the wiki moderators had a problem with the La Salle staff editing anything any negative comments posted on this PUBLIC forum, where people can post whatever is on their mind. Then posting their own sugar coated words. I should have taken these insecure acts as a hint before I chose to live here. I wont be surprised if they added their own fabricated comments under fake names. You can clearly tell most of these comments were home cooked by the way they do excessive praising.

I have friends who live here and have seen two one bedroom units here and one multiple room unit here. Decent sized room, dining room, living room, kitchen, and bathroom. The places are cute, moderately priced for the condition, and are near bus lines and shopping centers. I would live at a place like La Salle.

20060413 13:32:42 nbsp Is it true that they are lowering their rental rates? Users/MindyYang

20060413 16:02:34 nbsp I lived here for two years in a 2b+loft, and it was one of the better apartment complexes I lived in in Davis.  The general complex is fairly quiet, the layouts are nice and airy and have good lighting, and we didnt have many problems.  Its in a good location too.  The management was great and very responsive (dunno if its changed since).  Good location too.  Overall, Id highly recommend this place based on my experience there. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060808 21:45:57 nbsp whatever you do, dont live on the first floor. opt to live in an upstairs apartment as downstairs apartments are more susceptible to roaches, mold, and lack onf sunlight. im happy to be moving out of la salleits not all that great. Users/EmilyTung

20061101 20:06:15 nbsp woo I paint le salle on lease turnover if you live there chances are Ive been in your unit!!!! Users/StevenDaubert

20070422 11:40:48 nbsp I have lived here for two years.  When I moved in the condition of the carpet and paint were horrible, and the apartment had not been cleaned well before.  So I had to spend my first day there doing what the cleaning crew should have.  However, I think this was because the people did not move out early enough and we moved in so soon after, but still it should have been taken care of.  The old manager was great; the new one is okay.  He is responsive to the residents.  However, I fell one night out front of the office and when I called to tell the maintn. person all I got was attitude.  Trying to make me feeling stupid for slipping on a drainage crate in the middle of the walkway.  All I was asking was they do something like put a cone there so no one else would fall.  All and all I think the place is too expensive for what you get (but I did not want to deal with moving) and the people are average. Users/Shanita

20071201 14:10:37 nbsp I found this to be one of the more affordable 1 bedroom apartments in davis that had a good location.  I love being able to walk to get groceries.  The apartment (the 1 bedroom) is SMALL  but not bad.  The carpet had pet damage when we moved in, but the manager was nice enough to let us know that we wouldnt be charged for that.  They give a complementary carpet cleaning around november of each year, which is good.  I mean, it protects their carpet and it helps the residents as well.

I wish the office was open at more accessible hours  it is 10am5pm, which makes it hard to go in if you have a job with 85 hours.  Aside from that, the Manager is really responsive to residents, full of information, and always e mails me back promptly.  We sent in a maintenance request and it was fixed pretty quickly as well.  So far, living at la Salle has been good.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20080218 02:46:14 nbsp For the price it is VERY bad. When we moved in there were a ton of things wrong and the management wouldnt fix them until they became a health hazard (and some things that started out as hazards were ignored). the rooms they show are WAY nicer than what you actually get. Dont get fooled.
The manager is a nice, and the bus lines are very close, and you are close to two shopping centers, but I would suggest trying Pepperwood or Almondwood instead if you want to be on Alvarado. Users/willowspirit10

20080226 19:04:11 nbsp Just FYI, I and three of my future housemates put down their $800 deposit and filled out two forms including our phone numbers and other information. We were relatively high up on the waiting list. The management assured us they would call us as soon as there were any openings. A week later we decided to call them to see if they had any new information. They had lost our phone numbers, and therefore went on down the waiting list. There was no housing left. Be careful! If you want to live here I suggest calling them all the time and being very persistent. Users/MarielleBerman

20080523 06:41:45 nbsp Do not live here! I was here to help someone more and i parked over night. They towed my truck. There were a ton of empty spots in the parking lot, the manager was mad because i had parked next to them. Way to spit on some kids that are not hurting anyone.  Users/saju83

20080609 19:32:17 nbsp I love this place! I moved in with my boyfriend  now husband in Sept. 2007. Carlos (the manager) was so helpful to us the day we moved in, he made sure that everything was up to what it should be. Later on that week I made a note of improvements that it needed and they were fixed with in a reasonable amount of time. Just a few months ago, I complained about the kitchen sink, a few days later I got a brand new sink and faucet put in. Carlos always tells my husband and I that if we need anything then theyll take care of it.

And P.S. Parking has been sooooo much better since they inforced the permits, for a little while I was having trouble finding parking. And just so you know, friends can still park here they just need a parking pass. Users/Adaleen

20080819 14:29:06 nbsp Cable NOT included. Users/someday909

20080821 20:49:50 nbsp Do they allow pets? I mean little animals, like hamsters etc Users/someday909

20081109 22:43:12 nbsp Im starting my second year of living here. I was kind of dissapointed I didnt find a new place when I renewed my rent, just because I thought this place was kinda pricey. But once I started looking on daviswiki for other places with similar/lower prices for 1bed1bath and similar utilities, I couldnt find any. This place comes with just about everything except a microwave and a computer. When I moved in they had just replaced all the carpets, and the walls were clean.

Pros:
Safe I have never had my bike stolen here, and I dont always lock it
quiet complex
many utilities for good price well, in davis
near 2 big supermarkets
on 2 bus lines, and 10 min bike ride to campus
good amount of space
great management

Cons:
loud piping I wake up when the people above me turn on the sink, the shower sounds like an annoying waterfall
sound can get in easily
little light for 1st floor apts though when the trees are trimmed more light gets in
50$ fee if you dont pay your rent on time
my friends cars have been towed here before after they had been here for ~2 hours

no, I dont work for la salle. I just have been looking at other apartments and they all look expensive and bad, which made me appreciate my choice of la salle all the more Users/alyssap

20100309 21:20:27 nbsp I lived in La Salle from Fall 2006 to Summer 2009 and completely loved it; I only left because I had to move out of state for work.  The management and maintenance people (Carlos and Dana) are extremely pleasant, helpful, and quick to respond to problems.  Overall the complex is one of the quieter ones, though the shower system can be a little noisy (like you can hear through the walls when your neighbors use the shower).  I never had any problems with cockroaches or mold or anything like that, but I kept my place pretty clean so I think that helped.  The central heat and AC were great and the appliances were in good condition.  Also, its really nice to be within walking distance to Marketplace and the Save Mart shopping centers and right next to a bus stop for J, G, and F lines.  Ive lived in many different rental situations and La Salle was definitely one of the best. Users/RoseC

20100724 13:46:13 nbsp Some of my neighbors here are douchebags that burn out their tires loudly in the middle night while blasting polka music. Users/ToNu


20101204 12:27:04 nbsp The times are wrong; they are not open at all on weekends.  Beware UPS.  I was waiting all day Friday for a timesensitive package.   They delivered it to the office without knocking or leaving a note, so it was delivered while we waited at home.  By the time we realized what had happened the office was closed and we could not get in touch until Monday.  UPS is so stupid! Users/Sabrina

20110117 15:46:40 nbsp this place is not too bad it is quiet and close to the market place and savemart. I just dont like it here mainly because the one bedroom apartment is quite different than other rooms and doesnt really let for too much room between two people. my neighbors are really loud and run inside their apartment and since i live beneath them it sounds like the ceiling will fall. the appliances that we have in our apartment are old and seem to breakdown a lot, they come and fix them but its just a hassle that they break down every two months. we do not get much sun inside the apartment since its the bottom floor so its basically dark all day. also you can hear the plumbing really loud and you can hear when your neighbors use the bathroom the walls are very thin! the model that they show is not what they give you. the times that i try to see the manager they are not there so its not a great help if you have questions and have work and class. i think they might raise their prices for rent this year not sure though. i would save the trouble of not renting the one bedroom apartment maybe try the two bedroom i hear those are better but who knows i dont live in one.  Users/edna5

20110117 18:12:05 nbsp Still waiting to get my cat deposit back, we moved out on 12/19/2010. According to Civil Code Section 1950.5 the landlord mus pay back the deposit within 21 days after you leave the unit, the landlord must refund your full deposit, except for limited deductions which must be itemized in a accompanying notice.

It has now been 28 days :( Users/SarahS

20110121 10:25:52 nbsp I just want to respond to the previous comment from Sarah. You are completely correct about your security deposit. However I signed the lease with you and I know that your lease did not end until January 1, 2011. I personally mailed you the security deposit refund for your pet deposit on January 19, and you should have received it by now. You are correct that management has 21 days to return your security deposit effective as of the day you move out, but I was never informed of your move out date. When this happens we have no choice but to consider the end of your lease as the day you moved out. I apologize for the delay, but you should have your $500 pet deposit back in full by now (No deductions were made)   :) Users/chernandez

20110121 10:29:04 nbsp In response to Sabrinas comment regarding her UPS parcel. Management is always willing to leave any time sensitive parcels inside your apartment, but they must receive permission from the residents. Users/chernandez

20110121 10:29:50 nbsp Office now open Saturdays 12pm to 5pm Users/chernandez

20110301 00:07:47 nbsp Are pets allowed at La Salle? It says above that no pets are allowed but the comments about the pet deposit have me confused? Users/jasonn

20110324 10:03:16 nbsp La Salles Pet Policy has Changed. They now allow dogs and cats with an additional deposit. Users/chernandez

20110919 11:00:22 nbsp They rip you off, dont get anything close to your deposit back no matter how much you clean. Users/ElleBeit

20111118 09:33:03 nbsp I Love this place! I moved in about 6 months ago and couldnt be happier. everyone is supper friendly and helpful. Maintenance is great, when i call in a repair they are there that day or the next day. most importantly its quiet. Good Location. I like being able to take a short morning walk to grab some coffee. I would defiantly recommend La Salle to anyone.    Users/NancyNguyen

20111212 17:10:04 nbsp La Salle has been a great place for my roomates and I.  Management is always polite and responsive when issues come up.  The place is clean and spacious with a HUGE balcony.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone that is looking for an apartment.  It is a great community, great location (two grocery stores within walking distance), on two major bus lines (j and g) and has been a great place to live for the last few years!   Users/StaceyHorn

20120918 19:44:23 nbsp Great apartment!  I love their roommate program, so I could sign early and have my friends sign later when they finally decided.  The staff are pretty nice, albeit a bit ridiculous...  They would sometimes mail us letters, and when they posted notices they feel the need to give it to you several times via both email and hard paper, so I feel like theyre pretty wasteful.  Can be difficult to get a straight answer from them.  I told them that in 2 weeks I would need help with a repair, and they told me not to worry about it, that theyd be there the entire weekend so I should just grab them whenever.  The weekend came and I went to get them and I guess they decided to take the day off and not tell anyone...  Pretty ridiculous.  But the rent is fair, decent place close to school and multiple bus lines, and location for shopping is perfect (savemart and safeway just a block away!!!)  Move out was incredibly easy and done correctly. They had some movie parties that were really nice and fun to do. I was overall very happy with La Salle.  Typical college apartments.  Nothing too fancy or amazing, but definitely gets the job done! Users/SabrinaMuerle

20131030 20:25:46 nbsp Typical college apartment complex. Layout of the 1 bedroom is nice, huuuuge living room. Bedroom is tiny but fits two beds and a desk if you dont mind it being a bit cramped. Electric stoves. Friendly management. It is not a particularly quiet complex, next to Covell and a number of parties happen here. But residents (at least this year) are super friendly and willing to get to know one another. Plus you cant really expect a quiet complex in north davis, theyre much more crowded and are cheaper so higher proportion of undergrads.  Users/AnBan

20140113 16:21:15 nbsp Currently living at La Salle and although I like the apartment (spacious, decent appliances, great maintenance people) I have nothing positive to say about the management. There is a complete lack of responsibility regarding theft and safety. Within the first week of school, locked bikes were stolen from the bike racks directly in front of the complex. While bike theft is a common problem throughout Davis, there are zero measures taken by the apartment management to prevent theft or compensate for the loss. There are no video cameras to monitor the perimeter of the apartment, and you can look up Davis Police Records and see that there are numerous instances of theft and occasional violence in the parking lots. Another issue is mail theft, meaning that packages which are dropped off at the doorsteps of each apartment are often stolen by either neighbors or random passerby. The management does absolutely nothing to prevent this from happening besides blaming UPS for dropping the package off on the doorstep. If you value your property (bike, mail, and personal safety), I do not recommend choosing La Salle. I have lost hundreds of dollars this year from stolen textbooks and a stolen bike. I am not blaming the management for the theft, but I am blaming them for not taking measures that could easily prevent certain issues from occuring. Unfortunately, I am not the only one who has experienced these issues and I hope that by posting this review I can prevent others from having the same trouble that I am currently experiencing. For the price I am paying to live in this apartment, I expect management to show some respect and regard towards its tenants.  Users/ashleygreene

20140718 14:16:37 nbsp I have lived here in a twobedroom apartment since September 2013. The apartment manager, Tracy Montoya, is rude and unprofessional. When we just moved in, our toilet got clogged. So my housemate called Tracy and asked if the toilet could get fixed, but Tracy started yelling at her. Tracy said my housemate was supposed to call the emergency management as soon as she found out that the toilet was clogged. Indeed, my housemate did not call her right away, because we have two full bathrooms. However, I do not think it is the reason to yell at my housemate.
In addition, Tracy is very reluctant to answer residents emails. A lot of times, when she does answer, she will NOT answer all of your questions; instead, she will just answer one of your questions and make you keep emailing her. She expects residents to talk to her in her office rather than over email, but she fails to consider that students have busy schedules and if something can be addressed through email, why would we want to waste our time to go into her office?
What annoys me the most is that Tracy AlWAYS leaves her office earlier than scheduled business hours. They claim that their business hours are Monday through Friday 10am to 5pm. However, she always leaves before 5pm on weekdays. So if you happen to need to talk to her in her office around 4 or 4:30pm, expect to see an empty office.

Besides the unprofessional and rude manager, the apartment complex is not quiet at all. People have crazy parties at night all the time. And people always leave their dogs unleashed in this apartment complex.

As for the room size, I dont know about other floor plans, but for my apartment, the living room is way too huge, and the smaller bedroom is way too small. My two housemates cannot fit in their desks in the smaller bedroom, so they have to put their desks in the loft. HOWEVR, the loft is ALWAYS so freaking hot, so they never really go upstairs to study. Therefore the loft is basically a pure waste of money and room.

NOTE: this apartment complex does not provide microwave!!!
My advice: try your best to avoid living here unless you have some emotional attachment to this apartment complex.
