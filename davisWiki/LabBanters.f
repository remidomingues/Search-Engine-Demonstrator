Welcome to the wiki.


20071002 06:55:31 nbsp You seem to be quite familiar with the wiki, including injokes and politics, so Im skipping the pleasantries.  Lay off the abusive editing.  Not everybody here has time to deal with vandalism like this.  We have spouses, children, family that are important, and youre vandalizing the public resource that we volunteer for in our spare time.  Maybe you are the kind of prick who would go over to the EC Gardens and rip up the plants or otherwise destroy the work of volunteers in the community, but Im guessing you just see the internet as a big game.  Please reconsider: youre hurting real people with real lives out here.  I dont know who you are, and I honestly dont want to know.  Just please stop. Users/JabberWokky

   I agree wholeheartedly.  Its not funny  its abusive and intensely lame.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Im going to agree with Philip and Jabber here ... you went way over the line this time.  I did it for the lulz only works if its actually funny.   Users/BrentLaabs

20071002 19:59:52 nbsp Bleh, all this recent trolling is making me sick, the wiki should just be a positive place free from this damn drama, and all these messes. Users/DavidPoole

20071002 22:02:34 nbsp Im not on wiki all that much, but even I know this is steve. Users/LizethCazares

20071002 22:15:01 nbsp Take a look at the http://daviswiki.org/Users/LabBanters?actionuserinfo edit history... It doesnt seem like Steve. The only way it could be Steve is if Steve was trying to make it look like it was Brent trying to look like Steve (and both failing miserably by the way). Either way... It was in poor form for whomever was behind it and I sincerely hope that they suffer the karma that they are due. Users/JasonAller

20071003 07:28:35 nbsp I assumed it was Steve at first, but it turns out to have the same IP Address as Users/WilliamLewis. He also seemed to http://daviswiki.org/Users/KarlMogel?actiondiff&version2231&version1229 know who it is. The destructive edits are just about as bad as some of Steves old edits, except that it highlighted a couple pages that needed fixing/deleting, like the Prop 73/85 expage. Users/KarlMogel

20071003 09:02:16 nbsp What if it was steve pretending to be Brent pretending to be William by breaking into his house? I think this is more plausible.  Users/JamesSchwab

20071003 21:21:57 nbsp Or if it was wireless internet... I could see him lurking outside the window logging on! Users/KarlMogel

20071003 22:14:29 nbsp When will people learn to do even the most modest forms of IP source obfuscation?  I think an engineering student would know better... (sighs) Users/ChristopherMckenzie

 The person behind this account is not an engineering student. And youre right, an engineering student would do better. wl

  Well then, that settles that.  But read as less then a personal attack, I was more patting the oft problem of insufficient education  some graduate students in security couldnt explain Tor to me ...  Anyway, too much thinking for this time at night  and not important... catch me in the morning if you want me to go on and on ... Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20071003 23:05:55 nbsp You do know that David Poole shares the same address as Laabs and Lewis, which could be what lewis referenced with that comment. Users/MaxMikalonis
 We have a winrar. wl
