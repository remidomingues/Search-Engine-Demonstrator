From their website: The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement and the Office of the Labor Commissioner were established to adjudicate wage claims, investigate discrimination and public works complaints, and enforce Labor Code statutes and Industrial Welfare Commission orders.

The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) is an important website for employees to know about. The DLSE provides a wealth of information regarding the rights of employees in California in easy to understand formats. PDF quick sheets can answer many questions that employees may have about their rights.

In addition, and most importantly, if an employer fails to pay your wages, you can submit a wage claim and recoup your pay plus penalty fees.
