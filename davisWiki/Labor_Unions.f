Labor Unions in Davis:

   CUE Coalition of University Employees: UC Clerical Employees
   UPTE University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE Local 6, CWA Local 9119)
   AFSCME
   AFT
   wiki:WikiPedia:United_Auto_Workers UAW United Auto Workers: UC TA Union (UAW Local 2865).
   Davis Teachers Association
   wiki:WikiPedia:International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers IAMAW International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers has a IAMAW local chapter

Sometimes they hold Strikes strikes, and sometimes they get involved in election campaigning like through fronts like Working Families for Progressive Leadership.

California is not a wiki:WikiPedia:Righttowork right to work state. In 1999 then Governor Davis signed S.B. 645 which changed the UC and CSU system from wiki:WikiPedia:Open_shop open shop to wiki:WikiPedia:Agency_shop agency shops. This resulted in mandatory paycheck deductions for unionrepresented UC employees who were not paying union membership dues.

In the spring of 2007, the campaign to make Sodexho food service workers, which had been attempted 3 years prior, was rejuvenated. The campaign is led by workers, AFSCME, Students Organizing for Change, and has the support of numerous other individuals and groups. If it is successful, the union would collect http://www.ucop.edu/payroll/REL2006/Completed/SR81480_AFSCME/SR81480_AFSCME.pdf 1.5% of 500 food workers pay monthly even if they dont join. This works out to about $17,500 per month or $210,000 per year in addition to the money that they already were collecting from the SX and EX collective bargaining groups. At the same time, the workers would get more affordable healthcare (currently one pays 20 dollars a week to cover only themselves for Kaiser whereas under AFSCME they would pay about 2 dollars for the same plan). They would also be guaranteed higher starting salaries, paid sick leave, 15 minute breaks, a formal process for filing grievances, and union representation, among other things.

The foodservice campaign has been successful at other campuses, including UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Cruz, making UC Davis the only one to contract out their foodservice workers among the 10 UC campuses and 5 medical centers.

It would be nice to add national and international unions that are represented in Davis.
