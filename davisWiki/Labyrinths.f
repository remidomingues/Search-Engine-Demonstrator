20070314 06:14:50 nbsp The wooz was a maze, not a labyrinth technically...  Are we including labyrinths outside davis then? (there is at least one in sac).  And no, the one in mace ranch is really a spiral. Users/WesHardaker

20070314 08:13:34 nbsp Id say nearby only because if you like them, you are interested in all of them in the area.  This might become Mazes and Labrynths, or, if there are enough of both, an entry for Labyrinths and another for Mazes.  I tossed the semirelated info here because I didnt want one category page for a single nonDavis link. Users/JabberWokky
