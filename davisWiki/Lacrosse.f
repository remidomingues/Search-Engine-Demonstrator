Lacrosse is played at Davis Senior High School with boys and girls teams, and the http://www.davislax.org Davis Lacrosse Association has teams for several age brackets. Lacrosse is also a UCD Intramural Sports & Sport Clubs club sport at UC Davis, where there is both a mens and womens club team. The mens team exists as a virtual varsity team, as there are only two NCAA mens teams on the entire West Coast. For more information on the mens team, see Mens Lacrosse.  For info on the womens team, see Womens Lacrosse.

Lacrosse is a fastpaced team sport played by two teams of ten (men) or twelve (women) players, each of whom uses a netted stick to pass and catch a rubber ball with the aim of scoring points by tossing the ball into the opposing goal.  A team is split into three on attack, three on defense, one goalie, and the rest playing midfield.  Only midfielders are allowed to cross onto both sides of the field, with attack and defense required to remain on their sides.  The major differences between the mens and womens versions are two extra midfielders in the womens game, and much more contact in the mens game.  Men wear a lot more protective gear as a result.

Variations of the game such as box or indoor lacrosse are evil bastardizations of a beautiful creation and should be avoided at all costs.FootNote(Note: Opinions on evil bastardizations of lacrosse are not necessarily those of the Davis Wiki community as a whole.  But seriously, screw indoor lacrosse.  Users/ZacMorris)

The sport was invented by Native Americans Native North Americans.  Originally played on a kilometer by kilometer sized field with teams of 100 to 1000 men on each side, games lasted continuously during day light hours for multiple days in a row and were often used to settle intertribal disputes.  The usual strategy was to injure or kill opposing team members before making a run for the goal.  The sport was christened lacrosse by French explorers in reference to the similarity between the stick used in the game and a shepherds crosier.

Lacrosse is also the national sport of Canada, and very likely the coolest damn game in the world.
