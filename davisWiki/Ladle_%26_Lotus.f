Background
Amy first began studying holistic health in 2004 while living in India.  Since then she has continued to expand her knowledge in the field by studying Ayurveda, massage therapy, yoga, nutrition, and integrative health more indepth.  In August 2011, she completed a 75credit Master’s degree in Holistic Health Education, with a specialization in nutrition, from John F. Kennedy University.


20110911 17:12:02 nbsp Ive taken Amys yoga classes, both at work (as part of the Wellness Program) and also at Kaya Yoga Studio.  Its been a great experience!  Shes knowledgeable about both yoga AND human anatomy (which isnt always true with yoga teachers).  She can also readily address concerns about past injuries affecting how one approaches yoga.  I have wrist and lower back issues but was able to feel comfortable in her yoga classes, knowing she could make suggestions that helped me adjust.   She is also a natural teacher who is friendly, accessible, and most importantly, truly passionate about what she teaches, someone who continues to be assiduous and humble in her own practice.  Having experienced a couple of yoga instructors who were (unconsciously) judgmental and/or bossy, I am really happy to have found Amy as my teacher.   It is my feeling that anyone can benefit from her instruction, but I particularly recommend her classes to beginners who may feel intimidated about starting yoga, or to those who feel they havent found a good instructor yet.

20110912 14:59:37 nbsp Amy is a wonderful resource for personalized nutrition information. She is flexible and sincerely invested in her clients success in leading a healthy and fulfilling life through activity and a diet that works for them. She is incredibly knowledgeable in many disciplines and schools of thought within nutrition. She can speak to a practical, yet holistic approach to overall health. Despite moving out of town, Amy has still kept in contact and made sure that I am doing well in my transition. She is fantastic, full of wonderful information, and I happily have recommended her to many of my friends! Users/KCollins

20110917 18:12:09 nbsp Im fortunate enough to have had Amy as a yoga instructor at my workplace in Davis. Ive practiced yoga off & on for about 8 years (okay, more off than on), but Amys instruction has really given me a lot more enthusiasm for my practice. Ive learned more from her than from any of the other yoga instructors/studios Ive been to in town  shes got a strong understanding of anatomy, which is really helpful in adjusting poses or focusing practices to accommodate injuries or other physical limitations. But more importantly for me, Amy obviously takes a lot of enjoyment in teaching, and her classes are infused with humor. She also seems to be a good instructor for new or returning yoga students, based on the interactions Ive seen in classes. Users/TrayBiasiolli

20120105 14:41:59 nbsp I have learned so much about myself having Amy as my yoga instructor. Under her instruction I have been able to accomplish the unexpected and to accept and embrace my own physical (and mental) limitations. She has taught me to breathe. I can’t recommend her enough.

Her webpage also offers delicious and healthy recipes.
