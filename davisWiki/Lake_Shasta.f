Lake Shasta is a nice destination for a wide variety of outdoor activities.  It is located about 3 hours Northern California north of Davis on Interstate 5 in  wait for it  Shasta County.  Shasta is Californias largest reservoir and its third largest body of water (after Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea).

If youre looking for a closer lakey option, check out Lake Berryessa.  If youre in need of Shastas closer to home, theres always Shasta Drive.  Like Lake Shasta and Mount Shasta, the road was almost certainly named for wiki:wikipedia:Shasta (soft drink) Shasta soda (available at a Nugget near you!), and probably has nothing to do with the wiki:wikipedia:Shasta (tribe) Shasta Tribe that makes Northern California their home.  Right?
