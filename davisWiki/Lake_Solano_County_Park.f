Lake Solano is a reservoir on Putah Creek in the coastal foothills west of Winters on the boundary between Yolo County and Solano County. It sees more than 200,000 visitors per year. It is good for activities on or off the water.  Some popular activities include: Bicycling,  Birds and Bird Watching Bird watching,  Paddling Boating (no motors allowed),  Camping (RV and tent),  Fishing,  Hiking and Backpacking Hiking,  Picnicking and Barbecuing (enormous barbecue pits),  Sunbathing,  Swimming,  Town Wildlife Wildlife Photography photography. See the http://brtinsights.blogspot.com/2013/03/hikinginsolanocountycaliforniamap.html road map, satellite map and topographic map.

They rent boats paddle, canoes, sit on kayaks for $10/hour. Weekend parking is $5 for the day. If you have your own boat there is no launch fee.

If you get out on the water you can either go upstream under the #bridge bridge which will let you go up to the island, or downstream to the #diversion_dam diversion dam. The water tends to be very calm and can be surprisingly clear at times.

There is a surprising amount of wildlife around the lake; mostly waterfowl and other birds, but also legions of squirrels and even some deer (no hunting!).  Of course, the most common wildlife is the type that likes to feed off the crumbs and handouts of fat picnickers.

 Features 

 Bridge 


The bridge is located on the road that divides the park between the sides picnic and campings. People fish from the bridge, and even when they are not there the array of fishing lures caught up in the high voltage wires that also cross the water testifies to their having been there.

 Camping 

The camp grounds are a decent place to spend the night with friends. You can bring up to two cars per campsite. The place is a little family oriented, so try to not be too loud after lights out.

 Diversion Dam 


At the lower end of the lake is the diversion dam that controls the water, splitting it between agricultural usage in Solano County and the waters that flow down Putah Creek.


 New Zealand Mudsnail Infestation 


An infestation of New Zealand Mudsnails was discovered on October 30th, 2003.
