Lake Spafford isnt a ponds lake so much as a place south of Mrak Hall in the Arboretum where Putah Creek becomes obese and then thins down again. It is named after Ed Spafford, who was ASUCD President in 1953 and Vice Chancellor for many years(????).  Also known as the location of the Picnic Day Battle of the Bands, and a good place to find kids feeding Ducks ducks.

On Sunday afternoon, August 17th, 2014, Eric Jensen and his wife saw something they had never seen beforeotters! They were a group of about 68 river otters that swam into Lake Spafford from the west end of the Lake. The sight became even more remarkable and a bit gruesome when they gathered on the southern side of the lake to attack and ultimately kill an adult duck. Several ducks flew around the lake in panic. It was too late, and minutes after killing the duck the group of otters began to tear apart the ducks body before a number of horrified visitors to the lake. What a sight!
