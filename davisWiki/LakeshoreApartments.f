It was not just a suggestion. Please read the Importance of using your RealName. Close this account immediately and edit under your real name. Users/WilliamLewis

20100224 10:13:23 nbsp   Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Organizational accounts pose several problems, but the core issue is that they detract from a sense of community when one or more people use the name of an organization. This leads to a sense of faceless, impersonal action rather than the actions and statements of a member of the community. As a member of the Davis community, your contributions are very much appreciated, but it would be better if you make them using your name rather then the name of your organization. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions please do so. Users/JasonAller

20100224 11:57:05 nbsp As for the floorplans, youre currently uploading them to an external site. We want whatever content we put on a wiki page to be hosted here. Also, storing all the floorplans in an animated GIF makes it difficult for people to use them. Ive broken the GIF up into several individual files and Ill be putting them up shortly.

20100224 12:25:07 nbsp sorry, i was unaware, we were just trying to put up new photos of our property, it was an honest mistake! i made a different account with my name, can you unlock the lakeshore page now??? Users/jessicalakeshore
   It was never locked... it was simply zeroed out, which every person on the wiki can do.  Everybody (including you) can delete, rewrite or change any content on the wiki.  No worries... Ill go revert the page (which means bring it back to a previous version, another thing you can do as well).  If you have any questions, just ask  were a community of volunteers here (just like you), and there are plenty of people who can help you out.  Welcome to the wiki!
