Lamar Heystek was a member of the Davis City Council, a former columnist for The California Aggie, and a former employee of Safeway. A graduate of UC Daviss Linguistics program, his political life has centered on voicing student concerns and preserving Daviss Essence of Davis unique qualities.  He is often seen as an ally to Sue Greenwald on council, but that is mainly because of his cows slowgrowth stance.

Lamar is Dutch and proud of it, has a twin brother (who is on the board of education in his own respective location), a sister in the veterans military, and a father who is at least as funny as he is.

Lamar is also a monthly contributor to The Peoples Vanguard of Davis. Is this still true?  See also Heysteks Pothole Project.

 Davis City Council Campaigns 
 Petition to Urge Lamar to Run for ReElection in 2010 

In October 2010, Lamar announced that he would not be running for reelection to the 2010 City Council Election City Council in 2010.  Some of his many fans started a petition to urge him to reconsider.  The letter stated that Lamar has demonstrated leadership, honesty and integrity on the key issues that face the city of Davis, that he has been a voice of civility, maturity, reason, and passion in the face of great obstacles, and that the city cannot afford to now lose Lamars experience.  The petition is available http://www.draftlamar.com here. However, on March 12, 2010 at 4:30 PM  30 minutes before the filing deadline  Lamar announced that his October decision would stand and that he would not run for reelection.

 2004 and 2006 Campaigns 

Lamar first pursued a seat on the Davis City Council as a student in 2004. He finished seventh among eight candidates, earning 4,539 votes, or about http://www.yoloelections.org/sites/elections/archives/20040302/davis_council.html 10 percent of the vote.

On Wednesday, January 25, 2006, Lamar announced that he would once again run for city council. The California Aggie ran an http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2006/01/26/CityNews/UcdAlumnus.Launches.City.Council.Bid1505861.shtml article on it the next day.
His platform was based on:
  growth management
  neighborhood preservation
  fiscal restraint
  environmental protection
  policecommunity trust

His campaign slogan was Its a Brand New Day!


Image(lamarswear.jpg, left, Lamar being sworn into his new position. http://media.collegepublisher.com/media/paper981/stills/9m33r8g6.jpg Source.)On June 6th, 2006, Lamar Heystek was elected to the Davis City Council, with June 2006 Primary Election/Results 24.1% of the vote, in a major victory for the student vote, as he presented himself as a councilmember that would pay attention to the needs of the students, who are a significant slice of the Davis population.

Although detailed statistics are not available to determine what proportion of Heysteks supporters were students, the behavior of the election returns supports this assertion. Students typically do not vote by absentee, whereas establish residents of Davis often do. Early election returns showed Lamar clearly behind several other candidates due to the absentee votes which were already counted. As the night progressed and more votes were counted, Lamar gained on all his competitors. He garnered more ElectionDay inperson votes than all of the other candidates, finishing with the second highest number of total votes, winning him the seat (He almost passed the incumbent Ruth Asmundson). This suggests that he gained a greater proportion of the student vote than the other candidates.

 Safeway Career 

A head clerk at Safeway with a career spanning approximately eight years, Lamar decided to give up his job so he could continue to pursue local politics in 2006. However, Lamar did not make the decision recklessly, nor did he make it independently. The market had offered $20,000 to all of their longtime employees (including Lamar) to quit to make way for newer, lesspaid ones. Because of the strange nature of the $20,000 offer, and because few knew that the offer was made to all longtime employees, some people thought that Safeway was trying to silence his columns making fun of working at the market.

The job had provided Lamar with four years worth of fodder for his weekly column in The California Aggie, so by quitting he would be dispensing of this humor source, not to mention ridding himself of an income. In a simultaneously prudent and clever move, Lamar asked his column readers to weigh in and decide for him: quit or not quit.
(http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2006/02/21/Opinion/Should.I.Quit.Safeway1621661.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com Should I quit Safeway?)
 A week later, Lamar announced that he would be leaving Safeway. (http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2006/02/28/Opinion/ThePeople.Have.Spoken1640745.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com the people have spoken)

At his retirement party held at Woodstocks, Elise Kane and Rob Roy, in a joint effort, presented Lamar with a death certificate for his career (see image at left), a bouquet of tampons in a toiletpaper roll vase, and a Safeway womens restroom sign meant to be worn as a medallion. Needless to say, Lamar was thrilled.

 Career with the California Aggie 
 The Born Loser Column 

Image(lamar.jpg, Lamars famed California Aggie column mug, right, 300, noborder, thumbnail)The Born Loser was the name of Lamars weekly humor column in The California Aggie, from Fall 2002Spring 2006, spanning four years. Shortly after he started the column, column titles were stripped from most of the papers columns, so it ran without the tagline. Nevertheless, during funny antics about sleeping in safeway bathrooms, speaking dutch, and http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/11/09/Features/A.Stream.Of.Unconsciousness1318696.shtml peeing on an electric fence, Lamar managed to fit his tagline into the body of the column from time to time. The column ran on Tuesdays.

The Born Loser character always seemed to find the universe, both animate and inanimate, getting the better of himself. No matter what he could do, incalculably unlikely calamities befell him, including getting stuck between shelves while looking for dairy products for a cute girl. He also has had the unlikely misfortune to have died several times, you can read about one of them http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2005/06/07/Features/TheBorn.Loser.Dies1320825.shtml here. Death notwithstanding, Lamars column returned the following year.

Lamar always kept his column personality distinct from his public persona, especially as he got into Davis politics, but if you walk up to him and quote one of your favorite lines of his, he is likely to bowl over laughing.

There is a Facebook group called http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200419888 People Who Laugh Out Loud to Lamar Heystek Articles.

 Lamargate 

He has the unique distinction of having a major controversy named after him  Lamargate (although he was not actually involved in the scandal).  As an Aggie columnist, he wasnt allowed to have an opinion about ASUCD politics, to the point that they wouldnt actually allow him to use the word Lamargate in his column.  Once elections were over, in a http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2005/03/01/Features/WinOne.For.The.Loser1319754.shtml later column he did get to use the word.

20050721 12:40:34 nbsp I vaguely remember an old Born Loser column containing a paragraphbeginning my readership is so low I could insert a graphic sex scene in my column and nobody would notice or something like thatthat was taken directly, and without citation, from an old Dave Barry column. Of course, I dont want to make any libelous accusations based solely on my own memory of an event several years in the past, but does anyone else remember a Born Loser column fitting this description?

20060310 15:34:48 nbsp I think it is inappropriate and unethical for a candidate for the City Council who is also a UC Davis employee to have a column in the California Aggie.  Lamar I challenge you to quit your column in the Aggie, or else all the candidates should have columns in the Aggie.  Users/RobinSouza
  Good point. Ive been wondering why Editor didnt bring this up when Lamar announced his candidacy.  Users/ArlenAbraham
    I think its fine. Its not like Lamars column is in any way, shape, or form political. His columns are more like verbal diarrhea (not to take away from the funniness of the column) with no real point. As long as he isnt campaigning in his column or mentions anything about his running for office, theres nothing wrong with it. Users/VivianPham

  Yeah, thats right! And Rob Roy works at Ben & Jerrys... I challenge him to quit working there because it is unethical and inappropriate for a candidate to be giving away free scoops of ice cream during a campaign. Users/BrentLaabs

  Provided he doesnt campaign for himself in his column (and from my experience he makes fun of himself a lot in his column and doesnt campaign at all), I think its a bit unfair to ask him to quit his remaining job over this. Being the sitting mayor is surely more of an advantage  should Ruth Asmundson resign her position? Lamar is not a candidate who happens to have a column, hes a columnist who happens to be running for city council. It doesnt give him an advantage over the status quo: it IS the status quo. Users/KrisFricke

  It doesnt matter that Lamar isnt (directly) using the column for political gain, its not good journalistic practice to have a candidate with a column in the paper. Its basically free advertising because his name and photo are on the top of every column. Everyone knows that you have to work hard at writing press releases if you want Aggie coverage. Im sure the other candidates would love to have a column in the aggie  I know Rob has appiled in the past. The Ben & Jerrys comment is totally irrelevant because its not Ben & Jerrys job to provide unbiased election coverage to the City of Davis. I know that Aggie columnists in the past have resigned so that they could run for ASUCD Senate. Its a conflict of interest.

  Im not saying that lamar should resign, im just trying to support robins argument and was wondering why it hasnt been discussed before.Users/ArlenAbraham

20060310 19:27:36 nbsp I wrote a letter to the editor this Tuesday that didnt get published after reading Anna Ritters latest column.  Here it is:

Sir,

It has come to my attention that, as of late, the Tuesday Aggie has quickly migrated from the hillarious raunchy sex column issue to the Anna Ritter bitching hour.  If I wanted to bore myself with inane topical whining about the woes of frustrated college life, Id read that column by the guy constantly talking about his job at Safeway.  How am I supposed to flirt with girls doing the crossword at the MU when my old line So, did you see the sex column today? becomes So, did you read the latest from that Safeway bozo? Users/ScottRitchie
  You could change the line to So, does this rant make me look like a bozo?  Users/KarlMogel KJM

20060311 01:43:34 nbsp I would like to point out that if the Aggie chose to endorse anyone in the city council election, it would probably be a violation of the ASUCD Constitution.  If this is true, it would mean that the last bill that I wrote was unconstituional  oh well.  Someone should propose that as an official question to that court. Users/BrentLaabs
  Editorials in the Aggie are the collective opinions of the editorial board.  As such they are covered under free speech.  So the Aggie endorsing someone doesnt constitute a violation of the IRS code that the ASUCD Constitution forbids. Users/MichaelNguyen
   Let me paraphrase you:  Senate Resolutions are the collective opinion of the ASUCD Senate.  As such they are covered under free speech.  The Constitutional Amendment didnt just say you cant break this law, it enumerated specific things in addition that ASUCD was prohibited from. The distributing statements clause is particularly troublesome. Users/BrentLaabs
{{{
Article I, Section 6
(2)	In accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, ASUCD is prohibited from
directly or indirectly participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf
of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office.  This includes endorsing a
candidate, making donations to a candidate’s campaign, engaging in fundraising for a
candidate, distributing statements for or against a particular candidate or becoming
involved in any other activity that may be beneficial or detrimental to any candidate.
}}}
     A senate resolution is not the collective opinions of the senators it is a representative statement from the ASUCD itself, as an organization.  The Aggie opinion section is a forum for the opinions of individuals/groups of individuals, including those in the editorial board, not the ASUCD.  The editorial board in no way reflects the opinions of the ASUCD.  You are drawing a false parallel.  It would be different for the Senators to get together and say We, being senators, all support candidate X then to say We support candidate X in the name of the ASUCD. The opinions are the former rather than the latter. Users/MichaelNguyen
  Im afraid I disagree with your logic here.  When the Editorial Board collectively decides to endorse a candidate, is that not a representative statement from the California Aggie in the same way that a Senate resolution is a representative statement of ASUCD?  The legal problem is that THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE IS, LEGALLY, A PART OF ASUCD.  The fact that the California Aggie has large circulation in Davis (in fact, its said to have the largest circulation in Yolo County) and the fact that the California Aggies bank accounts are, in fact, ASUCD accounts mean that ASUCD is, naturally, leary of any legal trouble an Aggie endorsement of a political candidate may bring.  I suppose the best I can do at this point is consult our legal counsel and our business manager. PH
   From the Aggie Editorials represent the collecticve opinions of The California Aggie editorial board.  From that statement it looks like its the opinion of the Board not the organization.  Its the collective opinions of the Board, not of the Aggie itself.  When the Senate issues a resolution it is the not the opinion of the senate but a statement from the ASUCD itself.  These are completely different situations.  From the http://www.californiaaggie.com/about/ website Views or opinions expressed in The Aggie by editors or columnists regarding legislation or candidates for politicial office or other matters are those of the editors or columnist alone. They are not those of the University of California or any department of UC. Advertisements appearing in the Aggie reflect the views of advertisers only; they are not an expression of editorial opinion by The Aggie.  So its like a bunch of editors coauthoring one opinion, not a bunch of editors deciding where the Aggie stands.

20060311 18:45:09 nbsp Lamars dad knocked on my door this afternoon and asked me to vote for his son.  I was impressed.  I will. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20060319 14:15:04 nbsp I think theres a quite a difference between a school newspaper with an independent editorial board and the body of government itself.  Because ASUCD is the governing body, it makes sense that this mini Congress be prohibited from endorsing a candidate.  A campus Slate, however, could probably endorse a candidate without running afoul of this IRS rule.  I think its official (quasi)governmental endorsements that theyre afraid of.  So I dont think the parallel is tight enough to cause a problem. Users/JaimeRaba

20060328 16:52:19 nbsp Well, looking at the media board guidelines, it looks like the Aggie can endorse.  Im going to stop worrying about this argument, because I really believe that the Aggie should be able to endorse anyone they want to.  Its just a fact of the situation that ASUCD and the Aggie are in an abusive marriage, and neither seems to think about the other in its decisions. Users/BrentLaabs

 I was an ASUCD Senator from Fall 1998 to Fall 1999. I was honored as ASUCD Senator of the Year in 1999.  I had run as an independent candidate in the Winter 1998 election as one of 16 candidates  and placed 16th (I told you I was the Born Loser! These roots run deep, really deep!). In the following election, I ran as one of six candidates on the Student Action Ticket (not Student Action as is reported on the Wiki; maybe someone can make this minor change). There were eight candidates in this election  and I placed third from last (or sixth!), hanging on to the last seat by a measly 12 votes over my (now)friend Ken Loo, an independent candidate who ran on a twoply platform. I enjoyed this campaign very much, but my Senate win paled in comparison to becoming Senior Class President in high school (no offense!). I was the only ASUCD senator to vote against the proposed budget in June because it included an undeserved $7aweek pay raise for senators (bringing it to $35/week). One senator said he needed the increase to cover his electric bills, to which I said, Why dont push carts with me at Safeway? I actually donated each of my Senate paychecks to a different cause (one of them went to cover the expenses of attendees of the Students of Color conference, one of whom I would eventually run against in another ASUCD election). I ran for ASUCD Vice President on the Student Action Ticket with my slatemate and fellow Senate alum Jenna Ramesh. We ran against Matt Huerta and Erica Alfaro, who led the firstever LEAD slate. There were five tickets running and we worked hard to make it to a runoff with Matt and Erica. It was a tough campaign that we eventually lost. I congratulate Matt and Erica to this day  they had a much better field team and their support was broad and deep. Ironically, I was told that I would have been broadly supported by those who had backed the eventual winners had I run for president instead! I have not affiliated myself with the Student Action Ticket since, well, I was a student (its a lot like citing which crowd you hung out with at lunch time in high school for your ASUCD campaign, and besides, the world perspective that had informed my undergraduate politics has since changed). By the way, Jenna ran for president again on the Student Action Ticket (or another incarnation thereof  Ill have to ask her; I was studying in The Netherlands at the time). This was the first ASUCD election held via the Internet, to my knowledge. Previous elections had been held using fillinthe bubble Scantron ballots (which reminds me of how we used to register for classes  by phone!).  Jenna was briefly presidentelect due to the temporary disqualification of the eventual winners (which reminds me of the similar situation involving Senator Rob Roy). This was probably more than youd ever wanted to read! I can tell you even more about it over a beer or two. Users/LamarHeystek Lamar Heystek
