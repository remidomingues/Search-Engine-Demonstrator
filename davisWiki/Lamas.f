Lama (with one L) is the name of the genus including both species Lama glama (llama) and Lama paco (alpaca). Both can be found at the UC Davis Vet Med Teaching Hospital. Both species, said to have been some of the first animals domesticated by humans, are of particular interest to equine surgeons who say there are many similarities between horses and the ruminant pack animals from South America, which are more closely related to camels. Because llama and alpaca have become popular pets in California, School of Veterinary Medicine veterinary medicine students have created their own llama club.

Oh, and llama poop makes excellent fertilizer and is easy to gather, because they poop in little piles that look like a pyramid of rabbit pellets! Llama manure is considered by many to be the best byproduct of this remarkable animal. One major benefit is the lack of any significant odor which makes this product ideal for indoor plants. The dung is high in nitrogen in comparison with other natural manures and can be used on plants without the danger of burning them  this makes Compost composting unnecessary. Llama dung is also being used as a filtration system in Bolivia to neutralize acidic, metalladen Tap Water water supplies; this lowtech bioreactor system harnesses microbes living in the manure to neutralize the acidic water and remove most of the dissolved metals.

Llamas and alpacas are also treasured for their wool. Theyre closely related to the wiki:wikipedia:vicu√±a, whose wool is widely considered to be the most luxurious wool in the world. Your local knitting yarn geeks can probably say more about this. You can see some crafts made from alpaca wool at Redwood Barn Nursery. Yolo Wool Mill sells alpaca and llama yarn, as well as some finished objects.

Llamas are the perfect highaltitude, lowimpact pack animal  these gentle spitting creatures can carry onethird of their body weight. But wait! Dont just let those valuable llama turds fall by the wayside as you trek up the mountain... save it for your campfire at night. On those cold, treebarren highmountain ascents, youll be grateful to start your fire with some dry llama dung in the absence of any firewood. Though the dried pellets burn much like charcoal briquettes, the smoke has a pungent aroma.
