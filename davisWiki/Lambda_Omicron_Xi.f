Lambda Omicron Xi, or LOXi, is a community service Sororities sorority.


History


During the 2001 school year, a transfer student named Stephanie Hoffman found herself unsatisfied with the community service organizations on campus. She transferred from University of California, Riverside where she was part of a local community service sorority. She liked the sorority because she was able to participate in community service events without a long term commitment. She also liked that the sorority didn’t have tons of rules or required a huge fee every quarter. She researched some of the clubs and sororities on campus and even attended a few rush events, but didn’t find one like her old sorority. She decided to start a chapter of the UCR sorority at UC Davis, but there were too many requirements. Finally after some more thought she started her own sorority during the summer of 2002 with Jasmine Wiest, Molly Hucklebridge, Katrina Jimenez and Katie Holmquist. Lambda Omicron Xi emphasizes community service as well as sisterhood and friendship. Well known for their distinct Ladybug AFrames, the sorority stands out as a strictly community service oriented organization.
