The Beta Chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon was established in 1985. As an Asian Americans Asian American Fraternities Fraternity, Davis Lambdas is the most influential ethnic fraternity on campus. With many philanthropies and brotherhood events that spread Asian awareness, the brothers of Lambda Phi Epsilon has created an everlasting impression in the Davis Community. By getting 27% of all Davis noise violation noise violations, they have contributed to the building of many parks, and hiring of many police officers, who now till this day, still give us many noise violations. Many of those violations were simply because we had too many people congregated outside of our house. Although the blatant suppression of Asian awareness goes untested, we are trying our best to overcome these modern day acts of racism and oppression and prevail as a powerful voice amongst the other Asian American organizations in Davis. As the largest International Asian based fraternity in the world, Lambda Phi Epsilon is the stepping stone to success. By battling racism, Davis Police Department oppression, and community service contributing to the community, we instill values of leadership, honor, and courage into all of the brothers of Lambda Phi Epsilon, creating leaders among men.

In Winter 2012 the Registered Student Organization status of Lambda Phi Epsilon was revoked by the University for a minimum of five years.

They never followed up with me, or called to see how I was.  I have to admit though, they threw great parties. Not a total waste of time, but pretty close.  Live and learn.   Users/Aaron.Curtin
