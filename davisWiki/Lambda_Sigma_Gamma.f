Lambda Sigma Gamma Sorority Inc., is the first and largest multicultural Sororities sorority on the west coast.

 

Lambda Sigma Gamma was formed March 11, 1986 at Sacramento State University by 26 women. Our founder, Linda V. Fuentes found that there was a need for a sisterhood emphasizing multiculturalism. Lambda Sigma Gamma became a place where women who had a difficulty and unfamiliarity with the multicultural idea could come together and be comfortable among other sisters. These goals brought the 26 women together to form Lambda Sigma Gamma.

Since then, 20 additional chapters have joined our family and our membership has grown to include over 1,200+ sisters to date. The second, Beta chapter, was founded at University of California, Davis on May 6, 1989. We are continuously growing and welcoming new women to take part in our sisterhood. Our chapters are located throughout California and range from as far north as Chico and as far south as San Diego.

 Mission 

Lambda Sigma Gamma is an academic, community and social Sororities sorority. It is a network of women in higher education seeking to make university life less lonesome and more supportive for all women. Our unity is enhanced by weekend retreats, community service, educational programs, and social meetings. Lambda Sigma Gamma members have found that the sorority has given them lasting friendships, opportunities for community involvement, academic support, and the development of leadership skills.

Lambda Sigma Gamma is a multicultural sorority and as such believes in the value of diversity and sisterhood. It is through the acceptance and understanding of other cultures and lifestyles that Lambda Sigma Gamma strives to become strong and united. All women attending UC Davis are welcome to rush Lambda Sigma Gamma regardless of race, creed, sexual  orientation, religion, socioeconomic background, undergraduate status, or age.

 Multiculturalism 

We, the members of Lambda Sigma Gamma, believe that multicultural is not just a word, rather a deep rooted feeling which lies in our hearts. We, as individuals, have come together from different creeds, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic backgrounds from all over the world. It is within these differences that we choose to unite our lives and share our dreams, in hopes to educate one another and better ourselves. We will always consider the challenges in meeting our goals when striving to bring together women from diverse worlds under the spirit of multiculturalism for Lambda Sigma Gamma.
