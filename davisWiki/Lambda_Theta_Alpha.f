“The Eminent and Unstoppable”
  Epsilon Upsilon Chapter
   “Eternamente Unidas”


Lambda Theta Alpha (ΛΘΑ) was founded at Kean University in 1975 as the first Latina Sororities sorority in the nation. Lambda Theta Alpha strives to develop strong leaders that produce and engage in political, social, and cultural activities. Based on the principles of Unity, Love, and Respect, the Sororities Sorority was established for the unification of women through charitable and educational programs. Although Lambda Theta Alpha is Latin by tradition, the Sororities Sorority is inclusive to all women regardless of race, color, creed, sexual identity, gender expression, or religious beliefs. Lambda Theta Alpha is a proud member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations.

 Interested Ladies 
Lambda Theta Alpha is committed to the growth and diversity of its sisterhood. This is successfully achieved through the interest group called Interested Ladies of Lambda Theta Alpha. The Ladies of Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Incorporated take great pride in the interest group and devote much time to its success.

Lambda Theta Alpha recognizes the importance of reaching out to others and forming a united coalition of professional, diverse, culturally and politically conscious women. We are not an exclusive group and believe that all women alike should be given the opportunity to make their mark on the world. This is our right and our legacy.

The main goals of the interest group are to establish working and social relationships with the sisters and with the other interested ladies. As an active member of the interest group, interested ladies gain insight into becoming a member of Lambda Theta Alpha.
