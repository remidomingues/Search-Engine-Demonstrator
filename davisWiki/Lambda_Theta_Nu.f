Stepping and Machetes

In 1987, the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc introduced stepping to the ladies of Lambda The Nu Sorority, Inc by inviting them in a unity step. Then in 1989, Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Incs Alpha Chapter at California State University, Chico incorporated machetes, becoming the first and only sorority to incorporate machetes as part of a stepping performance.

Dancing with machetes has traditionally been seen as a symbol of a mans strength and bravery, however for Lambdas, breaking down this barrier has become a symbol of empowerment and determination for Latinas to integrate in ever aspect of life not intended for Latina women. Since then, chapters across the country have continued stepping with machetes as a personification of strength in Latina women whose perseverance is multidimensional.
