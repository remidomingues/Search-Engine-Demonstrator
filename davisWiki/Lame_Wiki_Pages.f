Think Lame as in lame horse... these are entries that need work or need to be put down.  The topic might be interesting and the entry well worth spending time on, but they cant walk the walk as they are currently written.


 Probably Unsalvagable 

  Christianity
      The Christianity page has a lot of nondavis information (and im not convinced it should). Im sure there are people in davis who worship satan. Users/ArlenAbraham
      I tried to condense as much information as I could for a person who has little or no knowledge on the subject. The intention was to educate, in a quick and organized manner without the person having to search wikipedia or something and recieving a long article and deciding its not worth their time. I was trying to alleviate ignorace.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

  White Supremacists
      Unless someone else can verify a White Supremacist presence, I say, delete. Users/JosephBleckman
       Search the http://davisenterprise.com Davis Enterprise archives, search for hate crime and the article will be number nine. Its basically about some skinheads in Davis beating the crap out of each other.
  Turtle House/Name Debate  mindnumbingly useless.  I disagree.  The debate shows a lot about the inner culture of the house and what people find to be important to themselves.  If you just skimmed it and thought it was just a debate about whether to name it turtle house or not then you might be right, but there is more discussed than that.
  When the bulk of wiki pages are made up of opinion, I dont understand how folks can say definitively that one page is useless. The page is longer than the Covell Village Debate? Perhaps that shows that this is an important issue for those involved. If you have no knowledge or investment in it, of course it is going to appear useless to you. I am uninterested in much of the content of the DavisWiki, but it would be wrong to delete it because I think it is stupid.  Users/MorganFlores
    Its not really about whether the page has a lot of opinion or not  its about whether the page has any hard information at all.  If 98% of the content is opposing sides of an issue without any attempt to compromise, people will just talk themselves in circles (e.g. ASUCD Senate these people).  A concise statement of each of those kind of issues serves better, and but integrating arguments is a lot of work so it rarely gets done.  The Turtle House page actually starts pretty well, so maybe it doesnt belong here. Users/BrentLaabs
    I would say that stupid is never the criteria.  An entry being deleted should be considered by most to be devoid of any value, including factual value, entertainment value or historical value.  I would say the TH/ND is a Lame entry that should be heavily chopped down to become a history (and where are they now) of the Turtle House and moved to a different entry (as should the Covell Village and Measure X entries).  There is a substantial amount of verbage that has value on the page... ironically, the debate itself is of the most dubious value.  Users/JabberWokky jw

     This page isnt lame at all!
      Dude, for people who arent in on the joke (read: almost everyone), the page has little or no meaning. While Im not saying it should be deleted, its definitely pretty lame for most viewers. The same applies to Tarmackia.
       Just because you dont have a sense of humor doesnt mean the page is lame.  Ive never worked for the Aggie, but its still got kitsch!
        Thank you for the personal insult. It really helps to make your argument seem more valid.
 Questionable 
  Area Codes (added Feb 13, 2006)
 not quite sure why Area Codes is necessary... its not like Davis is broken into multiple area codes; cant we just include our area code on the Davis page? Ill check back in about a week to see if theres any opposition to deleting the Area Codes page unless somebody thinks its deserving of a longer wait. Users/AlphaDog

 While it is true that I fixed it so that its at least correct, I tend to agree. Its below the threshold of mentioning that Davis has 7digit dialing, and otherwise, theres not much to say. Users/DanielBrown

  One reason to keep area codes is for the historical changes that they went through. Davis used to be in the 916 area code.  Users/JasonAller

    Philip, and anyone else who cares: I resurrected Area Codes after I examined it, saw that a lot of people had put serious work into it, and felt that a unilateral deletion was unwarranted. I can imagine it being useful to someone who comes to UCD from outside the area, perhaps outside the country. One could even argue whether pages about pay phone numbers or Internet addresses are as useful as a page on area codes. There are far worse pages than this one, and at the cost of saving a couple kilobytes, it seemed like an easy decision. BTW, it should be delisted from this page too. Users/SteveDavison
      The deletion was not unilateral:  There was a posting here (for a week), and discussion on the page itself, and no one objected  everyone who commented agreed to delete the page.  (As far as my caring, I dont, I just wanted to add it back to this page because it was removed on the grounds that the page was deleted). Users/PhilipNeustrom
    I created area codes just to document the ones in the immediate area, 530, 916 and 707. I dont see the point in having the whole state listed.  Users/ArlenAbraham
  cool spot is an example of a page that should be deleted when Davis Houses gets deleted.  This (latter) page has such an Ihuffscotchguardfumes feel to it, and besides, how can it have any legitimacy when it doesnt even list IHOP?
    Davis Houses lists public music and party venues where notable events (such as certain bands playing) occurred.   Thats an argument for keeping Davis Houses... and an argument (unless they have done more than is currently listed) against cool spot.
  Bicycle Rides  While its a fantastic entry, there is the rather important point that fully half of it is a copy/paste from another website.  :(  On the other hand, Kens website was written by a wikizen, if I recall correctly, so it is possible they contributed their original work? Users/JabberWokky
  Energy Healing  some say unsalvagable, but it seems reasonable that theres a slice of Davis that believe in, practice and are interested in this.
  Lame Wiki Pages  In theory, this page shouldnt exist, perhaps it should be just “community discussion”, I dunno, it just seems rather silly to have a page with a rather redundant purpose.

 Stubs and Starting Points 

These pages are a little skimpy  they need more content or just a better writeup.  Help them.  They are good ideas, just need a bit more content.

  Adoption
  Introduction
  Majors Pretty much most of the major specific pages
  Nam
  Neighborhood Watch
  Ralphs cornbread
  Renter Small Claims Stories
  Spots and Places
  Tenant Rights  Not lame, but it could be great with a rewrite and a bit more content.
  The Pavilion at ARC
  Usenet is mostly ideas for what should be there, rather than actual content.
  Vernard B Hickey  Just has quoted text (copyright violation)

 Copy and Paste Jobs 

   John Boe  A bad example.


    Is there a way to reverse includes  to see what entries include Copy/Paste?

 Jumble of Conversation 

  Covell Village/Talk  Somebody really needs to go through and move anything useful over, kill the rest.


 Discussion 
20051203 17:20:16 nbsp I think the lamest pages on the wiki are the ones that are essentially pages for people (UserPages) that have absolutely no content on them. There are some bad examples of pages that dont have anything informative. I think thats pretty lame. Users/JohnDudek

20051204 00:43:54 nbsp Sams/Politics is relevent to some extent, however it could definitely be pared down to a summary of both sides points, to remove the pointless bickering. The only real question is if that is done, would it be worth putting on the main page, or keeping it seperate. Users/JosephBleckman

20051204 15:30:22 nbsp Nobody forces people to read these socalled lame pages.  One mans junk is another mans treasure.  I think they should be left for further development, rather than deleted because certain individuals think they can force their values onto the entire wiki community.  In fact, I think this general lack of temperance with the delete command is making the wiki lame. Users/JaimeRaba

  If a socalled lame page has been there a while with no development, deleting is appropriate. If nothing else, it puts that page on the Recent Changes, possibly catching someones eye who might want to update it. Certain individuals have no more power than any other individuals; as a consequence, consensus going to prevail in edits. This is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus by design in Wikipedias as a general rule. Users/DomenicSantangelo

    There is no reason why consensus would prevail.  Obviously more people than you want to see these pages remain, but you persist in deleting them.  Users/JaimeRaba

       Im inclined to agree with you if someone took the time to make a creative page, its worthy of sticking around. I think the wiki is stable enough at this point that we should be encouraging more creativity, even if no one else has a clue that it all means. At the same time, I think we should keep track of any historically, but no longer currently, important pages a list will at least prevent them from disappearing gfrom the radar. Users/CraigBrozinsky

          I totally agree. The keyword being creative. Is http://daviswiki.org/JeromeJohnson?actionrecall&date1133374474 this creative? Users/DomenicSantangelo ds

          No reason for consensus to prevail? You must misunderstand the fundamentals of the Wiki. And in case you forgot, 1 is equal to 1, not greater than it. Users/DomenicSantangelo ds

          Its entirely unclear to me whether its consensus that actually prevails in edits, or persistance.  It is better for the Wiki if its consensus, but it takes skill and effort from all of us to make sure the best ideas rather than the loudest or most repeated ones prevail.  Sometimes this includes coaxing ideas from those too shy to speak up often.  I am not yet convinced we collectively have the necessary combination of skill and effort for this.  If we are not careful, the Wiki will be dominated by the most persistant users, and everyone else will give up and leave.  This would be sad.  (Could someone please find a better home for this comment? Thanks.)  Users/AlexanderWoo

            Consensus should prevail: we should discuss our edits when in disagreement and seek to work toward a common solution.  However, there are situations where discussion and consensusbuilding does not take place, and persistance pervails over discussion.  As you mention, some are reluctant to participate in debate or discussion of their edits.  Our challenge is to find a way to encourage consensus in the editing process, while still allowing for freedom to edit.  What can we do to make this more of a reality?  Are there situations in which consensus cannot be reached?  If so, how should we deal with these situations?

              Lacking consensus, you should respect other peoples opinion, entertain the idea that you are wrong, and move on with life.  I do it all the time  its liberating.  Users/ChristopherMckenzie
