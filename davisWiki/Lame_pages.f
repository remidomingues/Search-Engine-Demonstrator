This is my own personal list of lame wiki pages. Nuke them from orbit!

  Arriving Businesses  Timesink to keep current. Not useful.
   Somewhat interesting, IMO, if people bother to keep it up, which so far they have been.  cp
  {{{Current Businesses}}}  Timesink to keep current. When a business goes under or comes into town, is someone really going to go look for this page and update it? Who is going to want such a list? Really quite useless.
   The Businesses page, to which Current Businesses redirects, is useful, I think.  But the redirect itself is unnecessary.  cp
  {{{Davis Community}}}  Useless redirect that nobody would ever search for or link to.
  {{{Democracy}}}  No real meat to the page. If you read this, you dont come away knowing anything new about Davis, or even about democracy.
  {{{Honorable Businesses}}}  Every slumlord in town probably would feel entitled to be listed there—if anyone cared about that page, that is.
  {{{Index}}}  Anyone who is looking for an index of pages is better served by All Pages. Also, prone to grow stale. Nobody is using this, so it will never be updated.
  Mixed Race and Multiethnic  What is mixed race and multiethnic? Who would search for this term? Who would want to link that? Mein gott! The content itself isnt bad, though, just the name.
  {{{Philosophical and Religious Organizations}}}  Another useless redirect that nobody will search for and nobody will ever use for linking. Lumping together philosophical organizations and religious organizations does neither justice, anyway.
  {{{Station}}}  A hodgepodge page linking unrelated things together. Doesnt help anyone find anything theyre looking for. It was dead but now is resurrected pending a DNR request. Please consult the Zombie Attack Response Guide.
  {{{Tunnel}}}  All about tunnel in Davis! Yay tunnel! Now the page is a redirect to something potentially useful, but it there is still no reason for this page to exist—even as a redirect.

Grumble, grumble. Dragging an editoremeritus back to do housekeeping... is not wise. Do not waken them, let them rest in peace... If further disturbed they may point out the rot at the core of the Sycamore and make wide and sweeping changes. Users/JasonAller
 This wasnt aimed at you. This was just a place for me to complain. Users/WilliamLewis
