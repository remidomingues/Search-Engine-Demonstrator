20050511 01:37:21 nbsp I think whats kinda nice about this pizza place (besides the fact that I live right across the street from it) is that their toppings seem to be pretty high quality.  When you order olives and mushrooms, for example, you get BIG slices of black olives and giant mushrooms.  Makes it that much more flavorful, IMHO.   Users/KalenRidenour

20050602 18:22:47 nbsp I think Lamppost Pizza offers the best pizza quality wise, although the pepperoni can get kind of greasy.  The size of the pizza/$ isnt the best deal, but their pizzas taste so good that its worth spending some extra money.  And the big screens do give a nice atmosphere when playoffs arrives. Users/BenLee

20050606 00:12:05 nbsp Greasiest pepperoni ever, but I guess it works. Users/RohiniJasavala

20050717 15:52:52 nbsp Until recently, they didnt have evening access to the bathrooms. This place can get quite crowded with Little Leaguers. Users/NoelBruening

20060130 17:40:27 nbsp Their pizzas are a bit on the expensive side, but you can always find coupons for them in the PennySaver.  I actually prefer Lamppost to Woodstocks, as shocking as that may be. Users/CarolynVerDuin

20060305 18:31:10 nbsp I dont suggest fundraising with Lamppost Pizza because you dont get your check back soon. I fundraised there in Dec. 05 with an organization and we still have not received our check. Users/ChristineBui

20060622 03:33:33 nbsp They have green olives!  Yes!   Users/DudeNude

20060822 11:40:46 nbsp this is the best pizza in town.  if they were located in downtown, they i bet they will easily beat woodstocks.  i would have never known about this place if i didnt live right behind it. the only toppings i get is white garlic sauce with chicken and mushrooms.  try this combination and you will never want to eat pizza anywhere else.  the only problem is that they count chicken as two toppings and they also charge for the creamy garlic sauce even though youre not getting the tomato sauce.  therefore, it can get pricey, but i always use their buy one pizza get one for $1 coupon so i can get two pizzas for under 20 bucks.  Also they give you a lot of big slices of chicken so i guess its not too bad.  Theyre flat screen tvs are awesome and they have whatever game you wanna watch.  Dining area reminds me of most round table pizzas, large with comfortable seating.  employees are young and cool.    Users/PorkFoo

20060914 15:39:09 nbsp Their pizza is good and the staff is nice. My favorite part about this place is they sell dough balls! You can get get a medium, large, or Xlarge dough ball for a cheap price and make your own pizza. The dough is QUITE good. Users/RathyMarie

20061015 12:55:59 nbsp In their favor, this is the best pizza out of the places Ive been in Davis.  Pricey, though.  My gripe is that although they advertise having the NFL Ticket, the employees dont know how to use it.  The person working there said the manager is the only one who knows how to set it up, and since he wasnt there they could only show one game on all the screens.  Two customers in the whole place, and one of them (me) ended up leaving.  Users/TonyBraim

20061016 10:27:02 nbsp Me, my boyfriend, and all the partygoers who come over to our place, LOVE this pizza! Users/RichardBobo

20070225 21:04:34 nbsp Service was excellent. Came in on a rainy Saturday night past closing and they were very friendly and accomodating. Love the plasma tvs. Users/TerencePhan

20070509 00:36:06 nbsp EXPENSIVE. Food is smallportioned and not that tasty. Wait time is long considering the fact that we were the only people there. Service is alright, although they didnt mention the 10% discount with student ID... Users/MikeHubby

20070509 13:22:37 nbsp This is my favorite pizzafordelivery place in Davis.  Thats not saying much, mind you, but its something. Users/DanLawyer

20070608 17:03:07 nbsp I cant believe the comments about this place  the pizza is TERRIBLE, as is everything else Ive ever gotten here  Ive been here twice, and went with a group of people the second time (big mistake), and everyone thought it was gross.  Learned my lesson, though  will NEVER go back.  If youre in the area and want good food, go to the mexican place  its cheap and excellent. Users/AcMach

20070711 10:52:00 nbsp Grossly overpriced...You can get an order of breadsticka from Steves pizza that are twice as good for literally half the price. Also, their sandwiches are a rip off...a small sandwickhwith barely any meat that comes with a salad on the side will run you upwards of $8. They should make the salad optional and charge $5 for the sandwich alone like other places. I will never eat here again, although it is a decent place to watch a game and drink some brew. Users/MikeJones

20070719 18:45:11 nbsp About 10 years ago they had the best turkey sandwich  Users/dickjones

20070909 21:29:27 nbsp Its Sunday, and youve got a hankerin for pizza.  But Village Bakery is closed.  Symposium is closed.  What to do??  Lamppost Pizza is a fine alternative.  While I wouldnt say it was amazing pizza, the bread was good, the sauce was good (the place where a lot of pizzas fail) and the toppings were fresh.  Id definitely get it again.  As a nice bonus, it was prepared quickly. Users/CovertProfessor

20070923 20:07:42 nbsp This place has the best pizza but must have the smallest delivery area in Davis. They wont deliver past the 80 freeway and they wont deliver past Pole Line Rd.  That means if you live in one of the Wildhorse, Mace Ranch, or any other large neighborhood, you wont be able to get your pizza delivered.  Seems like a bad business decision to me  especially with so many other delivery options available. Users/HenWeigh
    No, it means if youre on the complete opposite side of Davis at this place, youre SOL.  http://maps.google.com/maps?fd&hlen&geocode5676126442663644288,38.566824,121.732464&saddr1260+lake+blvd,+davis,+ca&daddrpole+line+road,+davis,+ca&mrcr0&mramr&sll38.535813,121.714783&sspn0.118701,0.233459&ieUTF8&ll38.554139,121.717958&spn0.029668,0.058365&z14&om1 Look, Lamppost is as west as Davis can get.  Its about exactly 4 miles to Pole Line. Most places in general dont go over 4 to 5 miles.  Its just unlucky placement for them or you (depending how you see it).  A bad business decision is doing 7, 8, 9 mile deliveries on city roads with all the stoplights and (evening) traffic, and stopsigns off of the major streets..  Not sure what other options they have, if youre referring to other pizza places  compare the location.

20071005 02:39:52 nbsp I used to work here, and hated every minute of it. That being said, fresh out of the oven, it is one of the best tasting pizzas in Davis Users/DCWine

20071008 11:33:39 nbsp Great hand tossed pizza, I will say to the people that say bad things about the pizza here 9you were raised on crap pizza so you dont know what good pizza taste like if do not like try again and then go back to what you are used to little Caesars and see what you are missing) Lampost is great pizza and i am proud to eat here and will do so until i cant thank you lampost  Users/Brians

20071012 17:39:39 nbsp decent pizza, especially wiht green olives...mmm
has anyone tried their burgers? or fries? Users/YooHyunOak

20080707 17:29:44 nbsp The calzone is a great deal for under $8, and you get to choose 4 toppings at that price. I generally go chicken, bacon, and creamy garlic sauce. mmmmmmm.... Users/JoePomidor

20080907 22:08:30 nbsp great service, good food, 20% discount on their website!  Users/renee415

20081124 22:02:19 nbsp Best Hawaiian style pizza ever! They are a bit expensive, but honestly its worth it. I prefer their Hawaiian over the kinds types I have tried there (combo and meat lovers). The people who work there are also very nice. I have tried the calzone, and I did not like it only because the cheese on the outside kept falling off. Overall, best pizza in town.  Users/Kiran

20090110 17:25:17 nbsp Got a Super Aggie burger from here and no complaints. It was a bit pricey, but good food nonetheless. Users/AlexChiang

20090316 22:02:41 nbsp Expensive...but ORGASMIC pizza. I tried a slice at a party once, and am still craving more of their delicious garlickycheese. MMM. Users/BrookeB

20090403 15:00:24 nbsp The place was kinda dead last time I was in there.  No vibe, just felt sort of sad.  They seem to have nice TVs though, so maybe Ill be back for a sporting event one of these days.  The food was more than decent.  Love their buffalo wings... not too slimy or sour. Users/ChonT

20090508 19:36:55 nbsp hella bomb. Medium is pretty big.  Users/RealComputers

20090723 10:23:16 nbsp I just heard that Lamppost is moving to the Howard Johnsons location out by Mace. The notice I received said moving. Is this true? Or is it an additional location? Users/MattCzarnowski
  If its true, theyre gonna have to do a lot of work. That place is basically an empty shell right now, and I havent seen any new work done on it for at least six months. Still, if they did move, that would be very convenient for me! Users/JoePomidor

20090723 13:10:13 nbsp They used to have an additional location on Chiles Road, on the other side of Mace. Im not sure when it closed but I think I was there in 2000 or 2001. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091002 13:53:45 nbsp Lamppost pizza is your basic hometown pizzeria, with high prices. An extra large pizza will run you 25 dollars, before tax. They have some deals during the week, but all the deals still require you to spend over 20 bucks. Steves and Woodstocks do the same, but their pizzas are a little cheaper and they have better student discounts. Also, not unlike all restaurants at Westlake plaza, Lamppost is usually near empty and has zero vibe to it. How does anything stay in business in this plaza? Users/JakeJames

20091027 14:31:46 nbsp I tried the pizza here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and really liked it.  Ive got to agree with most of the other comments: its pricey, but some of the best pizza in town.

I just checked on their prices for pizza dough: $1 for a small, $2 for med., $3 for large, and $4 for extra large.  This seems roughly comparable to the Nuggets housemade dough (frozen), which runs somewhere around $3.50 for enough dough for a 16 pizza.  Im going to give it a spin tonight, so well see how it compares! Users/TomGarberson

20091113 17:09:17 nbsp I have never ordered anything from Lamppost that I havent loved!  Their pizzas are really good, I love their pepperoni, though it is rather greasy.  They also do really nice salads and their online ordering makes things really easy. Users/ReeseLayton

20100613 17:00:25 nbsp So, first comment of year. If only more recent, hence more timely, comments showed up first. Unlike everyone I know, Im not a big fan of delivery. But tonight, I splurged and ordered from Lamppost, mainly because there was a coupon here (though isnt 10% pretty lame?). They said 2025 minutes, turned out to be 35. Again, I guess I lack the big fan of delivery at all costs gene. Then, the pizza was totally wrong (and not for my palete :( ). I called and they said they made a typo. So Im taking the time to post this FWIW. Oh, and while Im waiting for the redelivery, I computed that in addition to overcharging me for a more expensive pizza, they neglected to take off the 10% (or is the food tax 23% hereabouts). Again, FWIW, they showed no interest in offering any kind of compensation or appreciation of my business for the mistake that THEY made and admit that THEY made. Anybody care to venture what my lack of success will be in getting a refund for the two overcharges...just back from the doorthe answer is a big NO! Users/Listenup

20100809 16:08:52 nbsp This pizza is sooooo great! Just thinking about it makes my mouth melt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Users/JackieRodriguez

20101230 00:21:04 nbsp My friends and I went there a few weeks ago. There was a coupon in the California Aggie that allowed you to buy two drinks and get a free medium pizza, so we jumped on it. The ad said Just mention the California Aggie!. So we got there and the first of us tried to order this deal, and they stated wed need a coupon. None of us really understood this, since the ad simply said to MENTION the California Aggiethere was no couponbut we did as they asked and got the coupon by printing the page off the Aggies websiteone copy for each person. When we brought these in, the manager immediately said, You dont think Im going to let you just photocopy one paper, do you?. We proceeded to explain that these were each their own copy, directly from the website, and that clearly, all of us being students, we could get copies of the printed Aggie if we had to. As if we were trying to pull his teeth, the manager reluctantly gave us the deal (and maintained a bad attitude). The pizza was decent, but my friends and I will never go back there again due to this disrespectful treatment. Why did they place a deal in the Aggie that they didnt want to honor?! Users/JustinHorton

20110213 12:22:50 nbsp We live in West Davis and discovered this place a year ago and since then we pretty much go every Friday. They have the best, freshest homemade style pizza and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a sports bar/grill, which we love. They always have awesome deals, but if you really want to get in the know  you should sign up for their text message deals and join their facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/lamppostpizzadavis) because they send out regular deals that you cant otherwise get. Like, buy one pizza get a second for $2!! Or youll get a text msg on a Tuesday night when you dont feel like cooking and it will say something like: Come in to Lamppost and get an XL 1 topping pizza for $12. The staff there is very cool  especially the one guy who manages at night (sorry I cant remember his name but hes really outgoing and loves to joke around with the customers) and often times you can see them flipping the pizza dough in the air while you hang out. Love that! The other thing we love about Lamppost is that they are open late (by Davis restaurant standards where 9pm is close!) and stay open during the week until 10pm and until 11pm on Friday/Saturdays. I wish more people knew about Lamppost because there are times when weve gone in and its been somewhat empty (may be a symptom of college kids gone for the summer) but Im also quiet fine with it being a West Davis only gem too.  Users/Bryna

20110317 16:42:23 nbsp The staff are very short with their customers and are quite rude as well with regards to coupons/discounts. You put out the coupons, so dont moan and groan about it when you have to honor them. Users/smittyhoy

20110430 11:43:59 nbsp Lamppost Pizza has burned me before with poorly topped pizzas and pizzas so greasy it soaks through the entire bottom of the box, but I stuck by them due to their proximity and their pizzas usually being at least onpar, if not slightly better than Woodstocks. However, after receiving obnoxious attitude and a terrible pizza the other night, I dont think Ill be back.

We stopped in and ordered a pizza togo, and while we were waiting decided to check out their arcade. Theyve got 3 games, a Cruisin World, some 6 in 1 retro game cabinet, and Soul Calibur. All of them were 50 cents (quite the price for such ancient games). While my friend played Cruisin World, I decided to play PacMan (Well, Ms. PacMan since its what they had) since the machine already had a quarter in it and Ive been on kind of a retro gaming kick. Midgame, while Im getting frustrated with what was possibly the worst arcade joystick I have ever used, I hear the cooks saying something about those high guys in the arcade. Since we were the only people in the arcade, I listened a little closer to hear the cooks talking shit about us playing games. What I dont understand is why Ms. PacMan! What I dont understand is why you even care that I play Ms. PacMan, let alone any arcade game. So a little pissed off, our pizza comes and we leave.

We ordered a Margherita, and there was waaaaaay too much garlic on it. And I really love garlic, so that is saying something. It was practically inedible.
So I dont know if the cooks messed with our pizza because they thought we were high or didnt like us playing arcade games, or if it was just a crappily made pizza, either way were done with the place. Users/AngryEnt

20111026 19:12:55 nbsp You Know....I am getting  rather sick of the horrible service and attitudes from these people. I mean really?? Do they absolutely always need to be such JERKS?>?>> I happen to live in there neighborhood. sometimes I feel like Something to eat from this establishment. But Cmon Really???? Their food is not that great!!!Why do they always need to be hating what they do so much? Its not our fault you are having a bad day every day... Users/ashleyinthemist
  Hunh... I get takeout from them pretty often and have always been given friendly service.  Sorry to hear that yours has not been.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Ditto.  Always a friendly greeting and a smile when Im in there, whether its for food, just drinks, takeout, or just to pick up a dough ball or two.  Its too bad youve had bad experiences. Users/TomGarberson
 The long term managers (the chipper younger guy, and the nice lady) have been around Davis forever, and worked there for quite some time. They are always super friendly Daubert

20111110 10:57:04 nbsp Updated 2/15/12 The burgers seem to have changed in December 2011 and I dont order them anymore.  My guess is they changed the beef they are using.  Can anyone verify this?  They ovencook the fries and season them, so they taste great and are relatively healthy for fries.  The salads are good.  The blue cheese dressing has lumps of real blue cheese in it.  Yum.  I have found their service to be very good for eatin and take out. Users/ChollaCat

20111228 19:25:30 nbsp Tried a calzone tonight. It was about $8.25 and was pretty big and pretty darn good. Users/MikeyCrews

20120127 13:35:06 nbsp Their burger  was surprisingly good. Not as good as B and B as the bun and bacon were both pretty ordinary, but still not a bad option for west Davis (its a few bucks cheaper too). I didnt really care for the thick cut fries. The calzone(pepperonni, jalepeno, feta, olives) is still delicious.  Users/MikeyCrews

20120628 21:13:33 nbsp The food is ok, but I was a bit frustrated by the lack of baby changing station. You would think that a family restaurant would have that. When I asked them about it they said, Yeah, weve been trying to get one for awhile, but havent been able to put one in. Really? Youve been in business in this town for how many years? It was so frustrating to try and change a 2year old on the bathroom counter between the sinks. I might give it another try once the youngest is out of diapers, but until then, forget it. If youve got kids in diapers Id avoid this place. Users/RichieB

20120722 19:25:21 nbsp Of all the options for pizza in Davis, dont go here. Their pizza is expensive and they engage in false advertising with their coupons and discount offers. Coupon advertising 30% off and also advertising to order online. So we ordered online only to go to pick up the pizza and be told that our coupon was invalid because we ordered online. (not stated anywhere online or in the coupon). To top it off customer service was very rude. Users/Laurieanne
  It sounds as though you may have been trying to get two discounts, one for online and one with a coupon?  In my experience, restaurants rarely if ever allow you to combine discounts.   Users/CovertProfessor
  In order for you to get online coupons you need to enter the code for the coupon where it prompts you to ( Should be below your payment information). There isnt much they can do after you put your payment information in and send the order through. However if you ever have any questions about the online ordering or if it is glitching you can call in and one of the employees should be able to help you put your order through or just take your order over the phone. As for the prices its not Dominos or Little Ceasars and the owner does a really good job sending out good coupons to make up for it a lot of the time. You can get the best deals by signing up for text/ email, if you go onto lamppostpizza.com/davis there is info on there on how to sign up. Sorry to hear you had a bad experience, whenever I go in its enjoyable.Users/DittoBrown

20120808 15:08:57 nbsp Lamppost is great pizza.  I wont try to rank it among the several excellent pizza places in town, but its among the best.  Its also pricey, but unlike many of the other pricey and delicious pizza joints, they periodically offer really excellent deals.  Among the deals are the occasional $10 off $25 or more coupons, some buyonegetonefree (or half off) coupons, and my personal favorite, the regular Monday and Tuesday deal: buy one pizza at regular price, get a second one (of equal or lesser value, obviously) for $3.  You wind up with a couple of XL pizzas loaded with toppings/sauces for around $30 delivered, if I remember right.  Heckuvalot cheaper than most of the other good pizza places in town, and a lot tastier than the budget options.

They also have very tasty chicken wings and reasonable beer prices (I think its $1214 for a pitcher of decent brew, including Mirror Pond).  This is also a great place to buy dough balls if you want to make your own pizza.  $1/2/3/4 for S/M/L/XL size, and the $3 large easily rolls out to a ~16 pie.

Service has always been friendly and delivery time estimates are pretty accurate.  They also participate in the iDine program (Google it), letting you get 5% back on your purchases there. Users/TomGarberson

20121228 13:55:15 nbsp I live on the other side of pole line and I was told by an employee that they dont deliver pass pole line?? HMMM?? I wouldnt mind driving to them if only they werent so rude!! Ill stick to Woodstocks!
