Ive only recently moved to Davis, and I hear theres a substantial community of Landmark grads here.  So I started a Meetup.com group, hoping to bring us together, and perhaps create some general communitybuilding as well.  Check out the group and consider signing up, or send your friends who you think might be interested.  Also check out the info I have there for the two Home Introductions Ive got scheduled for October 21st and November 5th.

To get to the Meetup group go to:  http://www.meetup.com/DavisLandmarkGraduatesLaidBackActivityGroup/

Its an opportunity for Davis area Landmark Forum graduates to keep the distinctions alive for themselves and each other while having fun in lowkey activities; Perhaps a game of Frisbee (bring your dog or friends and watch if you dont want to play,) a moonlight walk through the Arboretum, Happy Hours, Game Nights (Pictionary, anyone?) or whatever else we think of.

The goal is to spend a few hours once a month getting fresh air in our lungs (either by being aerobically active or by laughing our socks off, or both) while getting the Landmark distinctions reactivated in our brains.

This group is open to anyone who has graduated from the Landmark Forum and any other courses or seminars. Friends are also welcome as long as we have a critical mass of graduates (so the intent of the group wont be lost.)

Im committed to keeping this group alive, but Ill ask for input from any and all group members! Im hoping to create a space where we can take a break from the rigors of our everyday lives and reengage in the Landmark distinctions that caused our breakthroughs and transformations in the first place.

I will schedule the first event as soon as I get at least 5 members. I hope thatll be soon!

NOTE: As of this moment I have two home introductions scheduled October 21st and November 5th. If you youve wanted to introduce any of your friends, colleagues or family members to Landmark, this could be a quick and convenient way to do it. Just let me know and Ill give you the details.

Another Note: I moved to Cali from Massachusetts in March. So my personal ulterior motive is to meet more people in Davis. If youre a graduate with a similar desire, even better!

Bonnie.
