Hey there. Im Landon, currently a student at UC Davis (class of 2013)! I really love living in Davis because of how friendly and quiet the town can be, and I love the education provided at UCD (even if those fee increases can kind of sting). My greatest passion is my faith in Jesus Christ, and I do my best to show love to others every day in the same way he showed his love to me. Ive been involved at several different campus groups, and have loved them all! I also enjoy photography, playing guitar, and digital art.

If youd like to email me, you can do so at LandonE99@gmail.com.

Have a good day!
