Landscape architecture is considered both a University Departments department and a Majors major, though the Landscape Architecture major is the only major in the LA department.  It does not have its own Graduate Groups graduate group, but works closely with the Geography Graduate Group, and has ties to the Graduate Group in Ecology and the Community and Regional Development Graduate Group.  The LA department belongs to the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.
