The Lantana is a beautiful droughttolerant plant that it is planted all over Davis.

Lantana is REALLY hearty.  Users/LeonaScanlan My sister recently bought one from Ace Hardware here in Davis, and drove up to our Pops house in Grass Valley and ended up going to the river without taking it out of her car.  It baked in the sun for a full day and whithered, but didnt die.  The peppers she bought at the same time totally ate it.  This little guy sprang back and is getting big and green again.  Good plant.
