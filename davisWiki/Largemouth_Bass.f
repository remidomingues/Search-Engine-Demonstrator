Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) are the nations most sought after warmwater game fish. They fight hard, grow large and are tolerant of a wide range of water habitats. Largemouth prefer areas with lots of cover. Along rivers and streams they will hold close to the bank, by logs, or underneath overhangs. They do not like swift current and will feed on most anything that will fit in their mouth. Largemouth can be found in most fishing areas around Yolo county. They can be distinguished from the other bass species in Yolo county, smallmouth bass, by their horizontal markings and their mouth descending beyond the eye.
