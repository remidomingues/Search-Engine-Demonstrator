It looks like you and Users/natashahairstylist, Users/AlyssaHairStylist, Users/antainette all left forwarding messages on the Tangles page. The Wiki Community, of which you are part, is still figuring out wiki ethics. One of the issues that hasnt really been figured out is leaving information on a page for one business directing people to another business. Obviously in personal services businesses where individuals gather a following knowing when a service provider moves between businesses is important. Maybe you can help figure out some guidelines that would be helpful for both businesses involved, the customers and the service provider who is moving. Users/JasonAller
