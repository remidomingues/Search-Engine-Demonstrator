Larry N. Vanderhoef was the UC Davis Chancellor chancellor of UC Davis from 19942009. It was announced in an http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8684 article on the UC Davis website that he would step down from his position in June 2009 after 15 years as Chancellor. His last day was August 16th, 2009. He will take sabbatical for a year, and then return as a professor of plant biology.

Vanderhoef was born in Minnesota and grew up in Wisconsin.  He got his wiki:WikiPedia:Bachelor_of_Science BS and wiki:WikiPedia:Masters_degree MS degrees in Biology at http://www.wisc.edu/ U of Wisconsin.

He proceeded to serve on the faculties of several universities, until in 1984 he became the executive vice chancellor of UC Davis and the oneperson governing board of the UCD Medical Center.  Subsequently he absorbed the additional titles of acting vice chancellor for academic affairs and acting vice chancellor for research and, in 1991, provost (these titles held simultaneously, mind you).  Jan 21^st^ 1994 he was named chancellor of UC Davis.

Vanderhoef is a member of Sword and Sandals, but appears reluctant about it (at least in http://wwwucdmag.ucdavis.edu/fall96/Feature/Feature_Sword.html this source) and claims to have only attended a single meeting  the meeting in which they first admitted women.  He has received the AntiDefamation Leagues Distinguished Community Service Award.  He was the proud recipient of the http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/01/27/FrontPage/Chancellor.Named.sacramentan.Of.The.Year1319355.shtml Sacramentan of the Year for 2004. In his twenty years here at Davis he has not heard anything about Cow Tipping cow tipping, but is looking into it. Picnic Day 2009 is honoring Chancellor Vanderhoef as a Distinguished Legacy.

Much of this information was found in his http://chancellor.ucdavis.edu/chancellor.cfm official bio.

Was the first Chancellor to award the UC Davis Medal to people.


In early 2006, Vanderhoef faced the threat of a no confidence vote by the http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/story/14117181p14946392c.html Academic http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2006/01/25/CampusNews/Academic.Senate.Member.Circulates.no.Confidence.Petition.Against.Chancellor1504199.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com  Senate.  Seems like they were a little irked about Vanderhoefs deal in which he gave former vice chancellor Celeste Rose a $205,000 job with no official duties. Rose then dropped her threatened discrimiation lawsuit.

On http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7661 March 13, 2006, the no confidence resolution failed with 734 (69.6%) votes against, 320 (30.4%) votes for.

There is a blog written by Larry Vanderhumpf, an online spoof of Larry Vanderhoef. It is also called Fake Larry Vanderhoef  Dirt at UCD Fake Larry Vanderhoef.

The quad east of the Mondavi Center was named the Larry N. Vanderhoef Quad after he stepped down as Chancellor. He was also awarded the UC Davis medal and as Chancelloremeritus currently has offices in the new Conference Center.



In January of 2005, The California Aggie ran a feature on Vanderhoefs typical day in this http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/01/28/FrontPage/Spend.A.Day.With.The.Chancellor1319363.shtml article.
    I am the anonymous student in the article. Users/JackHaskel

I sat by him once at the Mondavi Center for the University Symphony Orchestra fall performance and he happened to clap at the wrong time, so I guess he doesnt know much about classical music. Users/RohiniJasavala

If you try to go to his office, on the fifth floor of Mrak Hall, his secretary will promptly kick you out unless you have a damn good excuse.  I know this because I tried.  Oh, and the fifth floor has some nice furniture in the waiting room, which youll never get a chance to sit in.   Users/BrentLaabs

Ive had lunch with him before and found him to be a standup guy. Users/JesseSingh

He kind of resembles Dick Cheney but without the sideways smirk.

Rumor is that Larry has a 2 million dollar slush fund that he can use at any given time, but it is only a rumor from past ASUCD Senate ASUCD Senators who knew him very well.


Ever written him an email?  I definitely got a real and very well written response to an email I sent him during the whole Celeste Rose scandal.  It really impressed me that he is willing to take the time to answer his email.  Users/NathanSchley


Larry is a good guy, when I was 1214 on my near daily excursions to the MUGA I would go down college parkway and occasionally I would stop and talk with him when I saw him outside. My dad told me I was chatting with the chancellor, and he became that instead of the guy in that big white house square house. We were on a first name basis, he called me Steve and I called him sir  Users/StevenDaubert

20061120 21:47:04 nbsp he seems like a pretty stand up guy. i spoke to him after the Dialogues with the Chancellor chancellors dialogue thingy his assistants held. he even gave me his business card and commented on my suggestion. woo fucking hoo. Users/EmilyTung

20081001 16:35:01 nbsp Chancellor Vanderhoef came into the ARC today while I was working at the front desk.  I find it completely hilarious that he forgot his ID card. Users/sososharp

20091207 10:37:00 nbsp I recall reading an article years and years ago in the Aggie about Larry being accused of being part of a money scandal that sent free millions of dollars to UC faculty and/or administration. I dont remember the details and I cant find the article in the Aggie anymore. I could just be crazy but does anyone else remember this. Even if Im completely wrong in my remembering it would be nice to see that article again.  Users/Thatotherguy
  Youre probably referring to the Celeste Rose thing.  Users/jsogul
