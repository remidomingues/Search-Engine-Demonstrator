20080609 02:59:35 nbsp I grew up going to this place. For 22 years Ive seen the barber Van here, but now I sometimes go to Aggie Barber just to save a few bucks. Go see Van. He is the funniest barber you will ever find. He has the best jokes, he knows exactly what hes doing and how to do it, and hell make the haircut worth your while. You can get a shampoo before the haircut too. Top notch. Users/JeremyDutch

20090131 14:50:34 nbsp I have tried many salons in Davis, and have had bad experiences. A lot of places are expensive, dont listen to the customers requests, and dont remember returning customers. I strongly believe that Lasting Impressions is the most underrated salon in Davis.
My stylist has been Maria Gates since last July. Ive gotten many compliments on my hair. She is talented, super friendly, remembers me, has even been able to schedule evening time appointments. She even gave me a bag of homemade treats at Christmas! Its also kind on the budget conscience student Haircut: $25, Haircut+color:$75. Maria also does eyebrow waxing and highlights (but I havent used those services). My only complaint is that they dont accept credit cards, so be prepared to pay in cash or check.
Tell Maria that Catherine referred you and Ill earn some brownie points. Users/Pearlinthemist

20090321 17:05:16 nbsp I think Lasting Impressions is a really great shop with so many talented people there. I go to Maria (My roommate) and she is amazing. I love how my hair turned out. Its wild! Who doesnt like neon colored streaks? Users/Mogitha

20090626 15:55:35 nbsp MARIA is awesome! I usually dont spend much on my hair (I color my hair myself and I often go to $15 haircut place) because I dont see why I need to spend too much it. However, when I had my graduation, I wanted to do something special so I went to Maria for consultation. She suggested that I cut my hair and partially highlight it. It cost me total 85 and I tipped her 15 because I loved it! I was timid at first because I never tried highlights before but Maria made me feel at home and just ease me. I was afraid I am going to waste my money but she made every penny worthwhile! I recommend this place for anyone who looks for something a level up than most cheap haircut place. You will be pleasantly surprised!  Users/farrasweetie

20090822 21:32:48 nbsp Wow, Maria is fantastic.  I usually spend about 50 or more on a hair cut in davis, but for a shampoo/condition and haircut it only cost 25.00! She gave me the exact haircut i wanted and she was very friendly and easy to talk to. I can definitely see why this salon is number one rated for 10 years. After trying out so many salons this is by far my favorite.  Users/kalane08

20091211 14:34:11 nbsp I called for Maria since I heard she does awesome highlights. The woman who picked up the phone said she no longer works there, however, she said she does do highlights. I then proceeded to tell her that Ive dyed my hair black before (since I have grey hairs) but I wanted to go lighter without it turning orange to which she replied, Oh no...I dont want to deal with that. Okay? Bye. Well, thanks for nothing! And I hadnt even tried the service here yet! Sadly, I didnt catch her name. Users/syang

20100318 20:44:44 nbsp This is the worst hair cut I have ever gotten, and thats counting when my mom used to cut my hair herself.  I walked in that the two ladies were gossiping and kept me waiting in the chair for 5 minutes. So unprofessional.  I thought about walking out immediately but didnt want to be rude. I showed her pictures of exactly what I wanted and showed her the length that I wanted it cut. She disregarded everything I asked her to do and instead of a college age haircut, I look like a 12 year old.  I tried to guide her throughout the haircut in order to get close to what I wanted but it didnt help either. The price for a womens cut is $35 not $25, just trying to keep you from being surprised like I was.  Overall, terrible experience. I would NEVER recommend this hair studio to anyone looking for a collegeage haircut. Maybe more suitable for people looking for an elementary aged style or a grandma haircut.  Users/jchanley

20100711 06:48:42 nbsp @syang, I know Maria personally and if you contact me privately (Mogitha@gmail.com) I can give you her phone number, shes trying to find a different salon. If you mind travelling to woodland, thats where shes at. She had family problems & had to quit because they wouldnt give her time off. :/

@jchanley, Who cut your hair? I know that Maria wouldnt do that, but she doesnt work there anymore. Basically its now a shop for old ladies and the same customers to gossip all over everything and give shitty haircuts for outrageous prices. If I want a shitty haircut, Id rather call my mom and get it for free. Users/Mogitha

20110302 18:20:28 nbsp ASK FOR DAWN! I have been going to Dawn for years and she is the best in Davis! She actually takes the time to listen to what you want and will even tailor your haircut to your lifestyle. Users/MargaretWong

20110307 21:51:10 nbsp OMG!! I just got a haircut from Dawn and she is soooooo amazing! This is the best color/haircut of my life its so modern and cutting edge. I totally reccomend her! Go see her. Users/ChantelQuincey

20110409 16:13:20 nbsp Thank you Dawn!! You did an awesome job layering my hair and the new bangs are the perfect length! This whole week I never stopped getting compliments.  Users/A.Walters

20111105 17:42:30 nbsp I just moved to Davis and was avoiding getting my hair cut because, face it, it is scary to go to a new hairdresser! I decided to try Lasting Impressions and am SO glad that I did. Dawn gave me an AWESOME Aline haircut.  The whole experience was great: they fit me in at the last minute and yet my appointment wasnt rushed (which is really important if you have thick hair and want a short haircut!). Dawn gave me exactly the haircut that I wanted and also provided tips about how to style it different ways.  My haircut and wash cost $35 in the end, which is more than some of the other places in town, but it was TOTALLY WORTH IT.  Users/SLongo

20111112 00:48:09 nbsp I had my hair cut by Dawn after reading this page, and I love it! Shes very easy to talk to, knew exactly what I wanted, and did a great job. I got an Aline and she made it work perfectly with my curly hair, which a lot of hairdressers have had trouble with. For the haircut, shampoo/conditioner and styling it was $35, but I just rounded up to $40. She spent almost an hour on me and I couldnt be happier with the result. Users/NicoleBeadle

20120121 14:09:13 nbsp I just got back from lasting impressions and I am in love with my haircut. Dawn talked me through what she was going to do, and it looked so amazing when she was done! I will definitely be going back! Users/emilycohen

20120203 13:38:07 nbsp Just got a haircut there and it was awesome!  Dawn was super nice and she did an amazing job.  When I got there I thought I just wanted a trim (Im usually kinda nervous about letting people cut my hair) and Dawn did something like one of those makeover shows where she talked to me about my hair shape and how she wanted to do something totally different with it.  I agreed to just let her do her thing and I couldnt be happier!  Also totally affordable.   Users/alpmille

20120223 19:12:10 nbsp Dawn was amazing! As always. She really knows how to listen and help you find a style that works for you.  Users/CaroBaro

20120318 09:27:37 nbsp I have been going to Lasting Impressions for several years and I always look forward to my appointment.  First of all I love the shops atmosphere.  It is warm and cozy and all the hair dressers are friendly and there is a sense of well being there.  Gerri is the owner and she is my hairdresser.  She is always pleasant and in an upbeat mood.  When I want a new look she always offers good suggestions.  I just had my hair done the other day and as always I love it.  Ive been to other shops over the years but Lasting Impressions is the best.  Even the customers are all friendly to each other and its just a fun place to be.  Lasting Impressions is all about people.  You feel it the minute you walk in.  A very positive and happy place.  CarolSchnitter

20120909 19:20:14 nbsp I decided to try a different hairdresser from my usual one, and given the good reviews on this Wiki I have Lasting Impressions a try. I had a haircut from Dawn, but was not very satisfied with the results. Although at the beginning she took the time to analyze how my previous cut was, when it came to actually cutting my hair she did a fast job.  At the end, my hair looked very similar to how it was before I walked in into the shop, and I will soon need a new haircut again. :( Also, Dawn was not very nice and polite to me. I think that my experience was more similar to a Super Cuts rather than a nice salon. I dont think the price was worth it! Users/EliraK

20130609 15:43:31 nbsp I love this place! Everyone is super nice and welcoming. Even after having Beth cut my hair for over 3 years now, I have always been happy with my experience. My cut and color changes a couple times a year (I like to change), Beth always listens and works her artistic magic. Users/DebbieWarner

20140728 15:05:26 nbsp Ask for Beth Davis!!!!!! Been going here for 14 years, and my mother has been going to her for 20+. Excellent.  Users/AllieNicole
