I have been a Dog Trainers trainer in Davis CA. Since 1992. I address both basic training and behavior modification for those special needs dogs. The training is based on improving the communication between you and your dog, first by understanding why our dogs do what they do, then by teaching them what you want them to do. The training method uses positive motivation instead of scare tactics, which only confuse your dog and increase unwanted behaviors. All dogs have the potential to become great companions if they are given the chance to learn what we expect from them and are trained in respectful ways. My dedication is driven from the desire for owners to give their pets a home for life. I acknowledge the terrible fate so many displaced dogs face. These wonderful animals gift people with so much. They provide sight for those who can’t see, they reach items for those with limited mobility and they bring joy to those who are sad and alone. They give unconditional love to their owners. They demonstrate the kind of loyalty it takes for any of us to sustain relationships and yet they are still discarded from the homes by the thousands for lack of training and commitment from their owners. I hold great respect for all of you who strive to give your dogs the very best, it does require an immense commitment and time to train your dogs. I also believe, you will receive the rewards ten times over! Lets have happy well mannered dogs. Training through play makes learning command so super easy. Leash work teaches your dogs to be safe off leash dogs and under voice control at all times! Lets have safe and happy companions. Kids welcome to Sunday family classes!

20130412 19:36:44 nbsp Thank you Wendy (and sweet Luna too) for deciding to set up a Laughing Dogs page :)    Users/CayceWallace

20130413 22:25:49 nbsp My partner and I used to help train SPCA foster dogs and Cayce kindly lent her time to teach the obedience classes. I definitely appreciated the way she led the classes, and I hope to use her whenever we get our own doggie. Users/MeggoWaffle

20130516 13:44:36 nbsp Cayce does a great job working with reactive dogs and rescue dogs. She has donated her time over and over to work with dogs to train them before finding a home, and Helped my feral dog becomes a happy interactive member of our family! Users/AshleyDunleavy

20130516 14:21:08 nbsp Cayce has helped train two generations of our headstrong Australian Shepherds. With our current dog, she worked with our kids to make sure we had a pup that was responsive to all different family members, and that we were all consistent with our commands and not making the poor dog crazy. Shes gentle, firm, knowledgeable and connected, and other dog whisperers have nothing on her! I consider her a local treasure and keep referring friends & their fourfooted pals to her with utmost confidence. We love Laughing Dogs! Users/AutumnLabbeRenault

20130516 14:31:59 nbsp There truly are no words that can express the gratitude I have for Cayce. She has helped me and my canine companions well beyond my expectations. She makes training fun and has enhanced the relationship between me and my dogs and opened my eyes to ways of communicating with my dogs that I didn’t know were possible.  Users/JodiJordan

20130516 15:59:58 nbsp When I got my first dog she was 4 months old and so shy she wouldnt come out of her crate on her own for the first month. I wasnt sure how I could help with her being so timid so I looked up different dog trainers in the Davis area. I received a flyer advertising Laughing Dogs from Midtown Animal Clinic so I looked into it. Over the phone Cayce asked me about my pup which I named Luna and decided to give me a free meet up to assess her, at the same time requesting I buy her a martingale collar. During this meet up she taught me how to walk Luna properly so she wouldnt pull away or just stop which was a huge step as Luna refused to walk up the street let alone around the block. While going to the puppy classes I saw improvement in my shy dog and became quite proud every time she learned a basic command. Eventually I moved to the small dogs class where she became even more social with the dogs as well as their owners. I am quite pleased with Cayces work as she is dedicated and truly cares for the dogs. She informs the owners of dog logic and is resourceful of supplies. The classes are well within budget even for a student and welcomes everyone with open arms. Users/WendyArnold

20130516 17:15:37 nbsp Thunder is my first dog. The first weekend I had him I went to Cayces class. I was in class for a whole year. Now I have the pleasure of being able to have Thunder with me all the time, as he is very well behaved and properly socialized. Even now, whenever I have a question on what I should after an incident (Thunder is attacked by an off leash dog at the green belt, for example), Cayce is always available for me and Thunder. And I know that Cayce is this generous not only with me, but with all her students. She also trains, for free, fosterdog parents! She is the only dog trainer I recommend to anyone who asks! Users/NataliaDeebSossa

20130518 15:07:43 nbsp Cayce has a magical ability to connect with dogs, and their owners, too!  With her vast knowledge and experience, she trains dogs to be happy, wellmannered companions.  My dog and I continually strengthen our partnership as we work with Cayce together.  And, classes are fun.  Everybody wins with Laughing Dogs! Users/MelindaHillis

20130520 07:47:21 nbsp Cayce is all heart! Her classes are like therapy for my dog Bear and me, and our relationship keeps getting better and better!  Users/Lisaboyce

20130521 16:16:23 nbsp I have worked with Cayce on my both my dogs.  My big dog, a mini golden Doodle, was a rescue and we had an issue with him escaping over our fence.  Through my work at Cayces class and through a consultation with her, we have been able to make Bentley be a safe dog.  He is now well behaved and very happy in our home.  Our little dog, a yorkiepoodle mix, is still working on not barking at other dogs on a leash.  The classes are very good and Cayce cares about each and every dog and owner in her classes.  Her techniques work and make sense.  I would use her over and over.. Users/SandraMansfield

20130605 22:51:15 nbsp I initially contacted Cayce because my dog is reactive and I never thought in a million years that she could participate in a group class, let alone learn commands without trying to bite everyone.  Though I wish she could attend class more often, Cayce has given me the confidence to continue working with Lechita (my pup) though she is difficult to handle at times.  Lechita has made a lot of progress with Cayces support!! Users/MelissaLKnox

20130615 21:16:35 nbsp Five weeks ago we adopted a 10 month old Pit Bull/Black Lab mix who is very sweet, but was also very reactive to other dogs.  Cayce worked with my husband, son and I to teach our dog in a consistent, positive and clear manner and each week our dog got progressively better.  Yesterday morning my husband and I were enjoying a relaxing breakfast date at Café Bernardo with our dog on the other side of the bannister, and up came a large aggressive German Shepherd.  Our dog stayed in a relaxed down stay the entire time.  That was definitely a defining moment for us and we are so proud of our dog and are so grateful to Cayce.  Users/DebbieS

20130929 18:01:15 nbsp I am experienced dog owner but found out the hard way that there is no real oversight for dog training businesses. I originally took my puppy to a supposedly positive only trainer in Davis who was celebrated in magazines like BARK, the SF newspapers and at UCD, but  used techniques that created confusion and increased anxiety in him (and many of the other dogs she trained) so that he ended up being reactive. Her solution was to blame the owner  and charge $90 an hour to watch videos of fearful dogs, none of which proved to be helpful. I then tried another local selfpromoting trainer who presented herself as a behaviorist and she, like the first one, was only actually effective with push button dogs. She had no real affinity for my dog and was unable to tap into my desire as a committed pet owner to train my dog and learn how to keep him safe and happy so he could be my companion. I was so lucky to find Cayce who immediately understood my dog and what I was going through. She was able to first of all, correctly assess the drives, temperament issues, and early training stressors that were causing my dogs reactivity and secondly give me actual hands on practical methods that worked! Through her tutelage I also learned that as my dogs  owner I am the the real expert on him and should never defer to people that are supposedly experts but do not have our best interests at heart. This newfound confidence in my abilities to work with my own dog is such a fantastic part of the gift  Cayce offers. She lets every owner know that by coming to training they already have been good owners but should expect much from the training and it should never make things WORSE for the dog. She also loves my dog. She loved him from the get go and when I saw how kind she was with him compared to the way the other trainers approached him, I almost started crying. He is an amazing dog and so is every dog. And that is what Cayces class is all about having our true best friends in our lives so we can hang out together for their still too short but, if we are lucky, very long lives. Users/lorimaloney

20140129 19:10:56 nbsp We have gone to Cayces classes for three labrador puppies over a span of 15 years. She has helped us get all three dogs on a great path to obedience. Cayce is great at problem solving with the behavioral idiosyncracies of each dog.  Her teaching methods are positive and effective.   Users/CathyFarman

20140201 16:02:06 nbsp I love Cayce and the whole Laughing Dogs team!  Their training classes are always very informative and so much fun!  They truly have fostered a supportive network of fellow dog owners and a safer environment for us and our dogs.  I recommend Laughing Dogs to anyone who has ever wondered what is my dog thinking? Laughing Dogs provides great insight to the canine world and AWESOME support through any training difficulties.  Way to go Laughing Dogs! Users/JacobMontgomery

20140331 17:50:31 nbsp Laughing Dogs is a team, and the leader is Cayce. To the extent that our dog, Trim, pays any attention to commands, its because she trained me to understand how he was relating to me. The classes are a positive environment, but youll be given things to work on  its pretty much all play for the dogs, but it requires discipline and focus by the humans. The rewards, however, are huge. I highly recommend classes with Laughing Dogs as a great way to improve your skills as an owner, and to improve your dogs behavior. Users/DougWalter
