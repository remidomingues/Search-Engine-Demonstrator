20090212 11:40:38 nbsp Please refrain from editing other peoples comments, even if you find them offensive. It is unethical to change somebody elses words when they have assigned their name to them, no matter how offensive it is to you. It is essentially misquoting the person. If a comment has no redeeming value, perhaps it should be deleted. However, dont change other peoples words. Users/WilliamLewis
