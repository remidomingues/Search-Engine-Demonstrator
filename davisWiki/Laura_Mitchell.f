Laura Mitchell is a 5th year at UCD who currently works as a Community Intern at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center as well as a facilitator for The Bivisibility Project.

She was beaten and detained by police after March 4, 2010 Public Education protest a march supporting lower fees approached an I80 onramp  according to news reports, because she grabbed a police baton. The AGTV video just shows the police beating encroaching protesters, Laura being dragged out of the crowd, beaten with batons, a police baton being taken from her, and her being dragged away. Some believe she was singled out because the police considered her a ringleader of the demonstration and the baton grabbing thing was another bit of lame police pretext.

While at UC Davis

Laura Mitchell started Crafternoons a weekly social and crafting event hosted at the LGBTRC.  Initially, Mitchell funded the event out of pocket, but when she was hired as a Community Intern at the LGBTRC in Fall 2009, Crafternoons became incorporated into the LGBTRCs budget and part of their regular programing.

Mitchell was a coordinator at The House for the 20072008 and 20082009 school years.  She discontinued her involvement with The House upon starting her position at the LGBTRC.

She is also one of the BEST PEOPLE EVER.
