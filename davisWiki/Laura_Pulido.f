 Platform Issues 

  UTILIZE AGGIE STADIUM TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL
 Ensure that our $31 million stadium is used year round. Allow it to be utilized by more sports teams, student groups, good causes through charity walks, and for entertainment purposes (night concerts & movie screenings).

 ASUCD STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY ADDRESS
 Connect our ASUCD representatives with the greater student body and hold them accountable by having them report directly to students. Use on oncampus media (Television, radio, print) to cover the address far and wide.

  INCREASE FUNDING AND AWARENESS FOR UCD CULTURE DAYS
 Advocate for increased funding through the administration and ASUCD. Bring new and creative fundraising ideas to the Culture Day programs.

  PROMOTE UCDS PEER EDUCATION PROGRAMS
 Better the campus climate by increasing participation in the different Peer Education programs. I will work with different departments and student groups in order to better advertise programs including SAFE ZONE training through the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Center and P.E.A.C.E. training through the Cross Cultural Center.

20081111 23:50:33 nbsp At the first forum she said that she would be willing to have ASUCD pay for the costs of having the stadium open more. Im not sure where the money for that will come from, but if you need help going through the budget to find the money I would be glad to meet with you and help in that process. Users/JoseBleckman
