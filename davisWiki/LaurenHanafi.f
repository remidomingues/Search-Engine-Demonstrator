Hey Lauren, welcome to the wiki! Users/PhilipNeustrom

Hi Lauren, I deleted your NAU page because it didnt seem to have much to do with Davis, the images you uploaded were probably copyrighted by someone else, and the only text on the page was a cut and paste. I changed your link to the wikipedia page. Im sure the wikipedia community would appreciate it if you wanted to contribute to that article. More people will see it on a nondavis specific website.
