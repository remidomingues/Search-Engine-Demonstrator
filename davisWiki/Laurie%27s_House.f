Lauries House is an innovative, sustainable, communitybased foundation offering multifaceted social services & educational programs.  We cultivate independence and selfreliance in children and their families.

Having received its NonProfit Organizations nonprofit status from the State of California in July 2010, Lauries House is in the early stages of organizing its services to support local young women and their families.

Committed to family wholeness, Lauries House plans to provide practical support, life skills, counseling, housing and a birthing center. Additionally, young mothers will receive support to allow them to complete their high school or postsecondary degrees.  Assistance will include helping to care for their children up to the age of 3.  With a focus on sustainability on all levels, Lauries House will incorporate organic gardening into its life skills program, from raising and caring produce to marketing and sales.  Participation will be rewardbased.

Lauries House is modeled after the Harlem Childrens Zone (HCZ), which supports the whole family.  The HCZs urban model will be adapted for the urban/rural communities Yolo and surrounding counties.
