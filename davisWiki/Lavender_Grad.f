This annual event recognizes graduating undergrad and grad studentsâ€™ contributions to UC Davis and the queer community.  Lavender Graduation is an opportunity for students, faculty, staff and community members to celebrate the accomplishments of UC Davis lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and ally (LGBTQIA) graduates. Lavender Graduation also provides a space for graduates to recognize significant people in their lives who have helped them achieve their goals (such as family members, a partner or close friend).
