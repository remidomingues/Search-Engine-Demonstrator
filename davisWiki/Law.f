The Law  the thing we love when it makes our lives easier and the thing we hate as were being hauled off to jail. Its no surprise Davis has its fair share of laws, as the United States has long been held to be a nation of laws (the rule of law meaning that the law is held to apply to everybody, with no one above the law).

 Law Questions & Answers 
Do you have a question about the law? Post your question here and perhaps some other informed wiki readers will be able to help you.

 Ive got a question about purchasing alcohol. If I am over 21 and walk into AM/PM with someone who is 18 years old, the clerk refuses to sell me the alcohol, because he has to card both people. But, if dad walks into the same store with his son, the clerk doesnt have to check the sons ID. Is there some special Davis municipal code? I know they do this to stop the purchase of alcohol for freshman at such, but whats the actual law?
  Stores have the right to refuse service to anyone. Theyd rather tell you to piss off than lose their liquor license over a forties forty.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a law firm that can create a prenup agreement?  Thanks...

   Folks: Practicing law without a license is illegal, and while citing general statutes or general legal principles to address a general question may not constitute such practice, I strongly recommend that section be removed due how easily that line may be crossed. Users/JaimeRaba
      That would be a great thing to put into the Questions and Answers section, Jamie.  I think that referring and recommending attorneys is still legal, yes? Users/JabberWokky
