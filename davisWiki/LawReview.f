Describe Users/LawReview here.



Howdy!  I noticed youre using the same computer address as Users/LawReviewEditor, which leads me to think you might be the same person.  Creating multiple accounts starts to get confusing, and since neither of you (or is it just one person?) has introduced yourself, its kind of oddly impersonal (and a bit hard to know who Im talking to).  If youre the same person, a couple people have left you messages on Users/LawReviewEditor, and if youre different, well then... welcome to the wiki to you, too!

20100205 00:14:16 nbsp No problem, Ms. or Mr. Review!  The wiki is about cooperative editing, and were a friendly bunch here.  If you have any questions, just ask. Users/JabberWokky
