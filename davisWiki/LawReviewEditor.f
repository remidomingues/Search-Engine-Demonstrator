   Then why dont you introduce yourself?  Howdy!  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I hear good things about the Law School and that rankings are really heading upwards.  The wiki is a community effort, so most people here use the name they go by in real life as a way of fostering community.  You might have noticed when you signed up the form suggested you use your real name.  Thats not to say everybody does; we are pretty open about odd names (look at mine!), but it does raise an eyebrow when you respond to a friendly inquiry with a terse three word, six letter reply.  It doesnt seem neighborly, and this is, after all, a community composed mostly of neighbors.  It seems odd that youd introduce yourself to your neighbors as Ms. or Mr. Editor.  At any rate, I just stopped in to welcome to the wiki welcome you to the wiki.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards (and yes, thats the nickname even my wife calls me).

20100204 23:47:56 nbsp How about you create an account using your name, then? Its the Importance of using your RealName standard way of doing things around here and it would prevent people from confusing you with people you arent. ) Users/WilliamLewis

20100205 00:01:12 nbsp Thats very fair.  Because the Law Review is run by a different staff every year, it seemed convenient to set up an institutional user name for continuitys sake.  That said, hi, Im Roey. Users/LawReviewEditor
   Ah, okay.  That tends to produce problems in the other way around.  Not only does it make it difficult for the editing community to work with you (since there could be a different face behind the mask each time you login, and you dont know if its who you were talking to before), but it also causes a lack of accountability.  Each individual edit is tracked (click the info button), and if there is an unknown plurality of people behind an account, you cant communicate with the person who made the edit  in fact, you cant know who made the edit.  Since discussion is critical to cooperative editing, it can raise all kinds of issues.  Think about it this way: imagine if everybody on staff used one single email address and never added their name to the bottom of emails they sent out and deleted emails when they read them (so only one person read whatever new email happened to be in the box when they logged in).  You could never communicate between each other, since you all use one single email account.  Community based editing is similar: discussion and accountability kind of rests on being able to know that youre talking to somebody youre working with.  It also allows you to edit the rest of the wiki without stamping the Law Review Seal of Approval to every word you type.  William pointed you to the Importance of using your RealName entry, and its good reading for some other related issues.  While role accounts arent strictly disallowed (again, the community here is friendly and operates on principals of openness), you should be aware they can and have caused problems in the past, so they have some social stigma associated with them.  Regardless, none of this is intended to dissuade you from participation  your contributions to the entry about the UCD Law Review publication are very appreciated, and Id love to see the Law School in general see more information added to it.

   Hey Roey!  I hope your 3L year is going well, and its good to see some representation of the Law Review on here.  As Evan said, it clarifies things a lot when you post under your own name.  You (and future generations of LR editors) can make a profile for yourself where you note that youre an editor on the LR, so well both have the record of who made the edits and know that its got that LR seal of approval. Users/TomGarberson  P.S. You doing any moot court competitions this year?
