 About Me 

I am a Davis local who is a solo patent practitioner. I specialize in helping startups and individual inventors protect inventions in the Internet, software, electrical, and mechanical arts. I have an online virtual law office, and I regularly commute between San Francisco Bay Area and Davis/Sacramento corridor in order to represent independent inventors and small start ups.

I enjoy being a patent attorney because it gives me the opportunity to work with entrepreneurial and creative people. I take pride in my work, and enjoy helping my clients build and grow their companies. I care deeply about the success of my clients and I take a personal interest in companies that I represent. I offer them direct access to my phone and a timely response within one business day or less. For this reason, I have dozens of inventors and clients who can serve as references for my legal aptitude and counsel.

Like many of my clients, I am an engineer and entrepreneur myself. This helps me uniquely understand and relate to clients and their perspectives in helping them grow their businesses.

I hold a B.S. in Applied Computational Physics from UC Davis. I received my J.D. from University of Pacific McGeorge School of Law, with concentration in IP law. I received a Witkin Award in my Computer and Internet Law course while studying at McGeorge.

 Legal Services 

IP Strategy Consultation

For most of my clients, this is the first step of our legal relationship. In my legal experience I learned that each clients business situation is unique, and therefore each client will need a slightly different IP strategy in order to have a strong yet cost effective IP protection for their business.

By creating a IP strategy for their business, a client can make the right decision at every stage of their business to protect their IP without breaking their budget, because it is a well known fact that we all have to start somewhere, and usually our resources are extremely limited at the beginning.

Patent Prosecution

I conduct patent searches and provide patent search opinions. Once the patent search result shows a good chance of patentability, I typically file a provisional patent application that eventually becomes a full nonprovisional utility patent application.

I also file design patent applications for clients who requires ornamental protection for the functional products.

Technology Transactions

I draft and negotiate information technology agreements. These include software licenses, SaaS and cloud computing agreements, domestic and foreign outsourcing contracts, IT distribution agreements (VAR, OEM), joint development agreements, data “licenses,” and IT professional services contracts, as well as sales of hardware, semiconductors, and semiconductor IP cores.

Internet & ECommerce

I handle legal issues specific to ecommerce and the business of the Internet, including data security, online trademark and copyright issues (fair use, etc.), and spam law. I also negotiate and draft ecommerce contracts, including Internet collocation and hosting agreements, ISP terms of service, online service level agreements (SLA’s), acceptable use policies (AUP’s), and linkexchange agreements.

Trade Secrets & Other IP Advice

I advise clients on all types of intellectual property issues. I have particular experience in setting up trade secret programs – ensuring protection of secret sauces, R&D, business plans, and other sensitive information. I also help protect and maintain portfolios of other IP assets, including brands, designs, and new technologies.

Privacy

I advise on compliance with privacy laws and regulations. My work includes HIPAA advice and business associate agreements (BAA’s), and crafting of employeefacing and customerfacing privacy policies, as well as advice about the other privacy issues that arise in commercial contracts.

Why I am Unique

Small Client Base with Multiple Projects

As a solo practitioner, one of my work philosophy is to provide the best quality of work on a given project. As such, I limit myself to a small number of active clients on any given moment. On a typical month, I work with 3 or 4 long term clients, and at most 3 or 4 clients who have small projects. With this kind of workload, I am able to provide fast response to Client communication requests, and spend more time with clients to discuss their projects in a better detail.

Highest Ethical Standards

In my years of practice, I discovered numerous problems that arise because of unethical behavior committed either by the lawyer, the client, or both. Many of these ethical issues arise unintentionally, but nevertheless the consequences can be dearly for the parties involved.

In my practice, I spend an extra time at the beginning of each project with my clients to ensure that our projects comply with all ethical rules that apply to us. Most clients I work with appreciate the extra attention and care to make sure that they are doing the right thing for the right reasons, and they appreciate how high of ethical standards our legal profession holds for each of the members.

Flexible Billing Options

In my typical work, I offer fixed fee rates for my clients. I estimate the amount of hours required to fully perform a legal project, and use that estimate to calculate the fees with my clients. Id like to know how much work I am getting myself into, and I believe most of my clients want to know how much fees will be incurred on a given legal project. Once the fee has been agreed, the first half is due at the signing of the agreement, and the remainder will be due once the documents are ready to be delivered or filed.

In addition to traditional billable hours, I also offer allyoucaneat services for a fixed monthly fee. As a client, you and I can agree on a monthly fee based on the estimated workload, and that covers all our services, or in some cases, all our services in a field of work (e.g., technology law advice and agreements). The fixed fee structure gives my clients predictable expenses and makes calling the lawyer more comfortable. It also helps align our incentives. It lets me search for new areas to contribute – trade secrets audits, improved form contracts, etc. – without worrying about driving up legal fees.

Of course, some relationships involve too little work for fixed fees, and some clients have sporadic needs. That’s why traditional billable hours are always available too.


Mentorship and Other Projects

Besides working with my clients, I also enjoy working with other lawyers to learn and innovate what I can do with my practice. I enjoy sharing my experiences with other lawyers, especially the ones who are entering what may be the toughest legal market in history. Therefore, if you are a lawyer, new or experienced, and would like to learn or share your experiences with me, drop me a line and we can arrange a meeting.

I am also actively trying to get the entrepreneurial scene up and running in the Davis and Sacramento region. I am currently working with McGeorge Law to launch what may become an Intellectual Property (IP) law incubator that services small businesses and independent inventors in the area. If you are interested to learn more about this project, please send me an email and we can discuss it further.
