Davis has a fair number of law students at the UC Davis School of Law at King Hall. All of these students are members of the Law Students Association, and do not pay fees to GSA or ASUCD. Little is known about these students, since they dont have a class in Wellman Hall every quarter like the rest of the students do. However, they are known to hang out variously at G Street Pub and Sophias. Many law students become teaching assistants for departments like Political Science, Economics, Asian American Studies, etc. They tend to practice law after graduation, primarily for private firms and the state and federal government. However, a significant amount of law students go on to perform legal and nonlegal work for public interest and nonprofit organizations, international nongovernmental organizations, as well as work in supporting roles in the California state legislature.

There are also undergraduates who are prelaw students working toward becoming law students. Some might be members of Phi Alpha Delta, a prelaw coed fraternity.

http://www.mcgeorge.edu McGeorge School of Law at the http://pacific.edu University of the Pacific is another Sacramento regional law school which some UC Davis undergraduate students go on to attend. Lincoln Law School (nonABA, http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Education/LegalEducation/LawSchools.aspx California accredited) is another Sacramentobased law school with significant numbers of UC Davis alumni.

In 20092010, 53% of law students were women and 37% were students of color.
