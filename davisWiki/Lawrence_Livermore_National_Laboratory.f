Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a US Department of Energy research institution that is operated by a consortium consisting of the University of California and various private companies. As of 2007 it was no longer managed by the University of California, but rather Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC. It is home to a UC Davis extension associated with Applied Science, which was created as a dual appointment for physicist and nuclear weaponry enthusiast Edward Teller.
