 The Name of this Band was Lawsuit 


Once upon a time there was a band in Davis named Lawsuit.  It was a 10 piece band, known for its quirky lyrics and its 4piece horn section (the Horns of Adequacy).  The band played up and down California, were popular entertainment for the Whole Earth Festival and regulars at the Palms Playhouse when it was still here in Davis.

The band broke up in 1996 and its lead singer, http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~basykes/paul.htm Paul Sykes died in 1999.

Interested parties can visit http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lawsuit/37123275565 Lawsuits Facebook Page for details and pictures, or download full albums from the http://preoccupiedpipers.com/tt/discography/ Preoccupied Pipers website. There was a website called The Lawsuit Graveyard but the internet seems to have lost it. For quite awhile people would ask Armadillo Records for CDs and were directed to the site.  Lately Ned has been posting Lawsuit and Paul videos to http://www.youtube.com/user/preoccupiedpipers.

If anybody is desperate for it, Users/JabberWokky thinks he mirrored the site while it was active and has it somewhere on a spindle of DVDs.

20060707 08:11:20 nbsp Lawsuit was my favorite band when I was attending UCD.  The halloween show they did at the Varsity theater will be in my mind forever (especially the Oingo Boingo covers, those were fabulous).  I still listen to Emergency Third Rail Power Trip on occasion, as well as some of the earlier Preoccupied Pipers work.  I miss this band. :( Users/AlexPomeranz

20060809 03:12:40 nbsp Aaron feldstein showed me this incredible music when he found third rail power trip(One of lawsuits CDs) a few years back (I beleive at his girlfriends mothers hosue) and Ive been hooked ever since.  Ive got all their Mp3s from the graveyard, and im on the waiting list for CDs at armadillo and the two major music stores in berkley.  They were an absolutley amazing band and im very dissapointed I never knew about then while they were still in existance as a group.  Its unfortunate that theyre not around anymore, Davis could use a glorious local band to get behind.  Just absolutley stunning lyrics. Users/OlinHannum
