LeTip of Davis is a local chapter of LeTip International, a private business networking group dedicated to generating business leads for small business and consultants. The group meets weekly to pass business tips. These tips are recorded and compiled to show members how much business they are generating from the group. The meetings are a high energy and profitable source of support for small business owners and consultants. Since the first meeting of the Davis chapter on July 11, 2011, the group has exchanged over $20,500 worth of business leads among its members as of April 2012.

To make sure conflicts of interest do not occur, only one business per category is allowed into the group, although categories may be subdivided. For example, a group may have a mechanic specializing in foreign car repair and another specializing in domestic auto repair. An ethics chairperson ensures that conflicts of interest are resolved if ever they arise among members, which is rare.

The LeTip of Davis group started meeting in July of 2011 at Common Grounds. As new members joined and they outgrew the space, the board voted to move the meeting to a Tuesday lunch meeting at Our House Restaurant. The group meets every week, and an attendance policy ensures that only committed businesses stay with the group.

As a newer group, there are still many coveted categories open. The Most Wanted List includes:

 1. Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
 1. Bookkeeper
 1. Attorney â€“ Personal Injury
 1. Attorney  Bankruptcy
 1. automobile repair Auto Mechanic
 1. housekeeping Housecleaner
 1. Beauty Salons and Barber Shops Hair Stylist
 1. Acupuncturist
 1. Handyman
 1.  Restaurants Restaurant
 1. Auto Body Repair


Interested business are encouraged to attend two lunch meetings in a row to learn how the group works and see if their business is a good fit. The first lunch is paid for by the group. To attend a meeting, please call Lily Starling of Downtown Davis Massage and Wellness at (530) 4007646. Any business is welcome and encouraged to join regardless of whether they are on the MostWanted List, unless that category is currently represented.

20111230 15:27:00 nbsp Ive been a member of LeTip of Davis for just about 2 months now and Ive gotten 5 new very outstanding clients from my LeTip Group (some are actual LeTip members, and others are outside of LeTip). Ive also gotten to experience services from many of the LeTip members. One thing that is very important to me is that businesses that I refer to are top notch, because I feel like I put my reputation on the line each time I refer one of my clients to someone. Im happy to report that each of my experiences with a LeTip Davis member has been excellent. This group is becoming to feel like a business focused family to me, and I look forward to our LeTip lunch meeting every Tuesday at 11:30am at Our House, where we bounce business ideas off one another and exchange business referrals. If youre looking to grow your business and you are the best at what you do, then I would encourage you to check us out by attending one of our LeTip meetings (Our House in Davis, on 2nd Street; Every Tuesday from 11:30am to 1pm).

20120102 15:39:10 nbsp I agree with Laura, I am very satisfied thus far.  Thank you to Lily Starling for putting this Wiki page together! Users/JustinLowenthal

20120530 17:15:52 nbsp My business The Laundry Lounge has been a member of LeTips Davis Chapter since November 2011.  We decided to join after not really getting any direct benefit of being a member of the Davis Chamber of Commerce for years.  I love LeTip because it directly drives customers to my business!  Since joining I have done over $2000 in sales directly from LeTip tips.  The way it works is everyone in our chapter recommends my business to their friends, family and coworkers if they need the service The Laundry Lounge offers!  The best marketing dollars I ever spent were on my LeTip membership.  My ROI has been fantastic.  We also meet each week and discuss business tips with other small business owners (each other,) all the while passing business tips to each other for people we know who want to use our services.  Its great.  COme check us out every Tuesday at 11:30 am at Our House Restaurant in Davis.  Lunch is on us! Users/dina2901
