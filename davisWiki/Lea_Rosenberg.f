Note: Lea has recently been targeted in a lawsuit regarding her involvement in several charitable organizations in Davis and Yolo County alleging that she has used her widespread connections in the Davis community to fraudulently raise funds for services for foster children, young adults who have aged out of foster care, and families at risk.  The lawsuit also names other prominent people (Judges, defense attorneys, district attorneys, and business people) in Yolo County associated with the Davis Odd Fellows, Soroptimists and other nonprofit organizations, plus others, including Attorney General Kamala Harris.  The Plaintiff apparently has a criminal case pending in Yolo County Superior Court.
