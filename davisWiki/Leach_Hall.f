address(Lysle Leach Hall, 38.535669, 121.756408) is located on the south end of the Tercero dorm area and is apart from the other dorms . These dorms were originally built for Grad Students graduate students but were converted to undergraduate Dorms dorms recently to accommodate a growing population of undergraduate students.

Lysle Leach Hall is comprised of 178 rooms arranged with either four or five rooms sharing a common hallway and bathroom in a suite configuration. A variety of facilities are available to the residents, including a laundry room, television lounge, study lounges with full kitchenettes, and a game room with piano, pingpong & pool tables. A convenience store and Learning Resource Center are also located within the Tercero area.  from http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/Halls/New/default.htm

All of the rooms in Leach are singles (meaning one lucky person gets the entire room), and four or five rooms share a common bathroom. Many past residents have complained that Leach has an asocial atmosphere that makes it hard to meet people (due to the fact that most, if not all, of the doors being closed on most nights) and reluctance of its residents to attend social events.  In Spring 2006, the study lounge was converted to a custodial office, leaving only the television lounge and game room available for resident use.  Through healthy and normal interaction recent freshmen classes have shown that the heart of the asocial problem lies in the students who inhabit Leach, not Leach itself.

After the 20112012 academic year, Leach Hall was scheduled to be decommissioned and demolished, according to Student Housings http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/about/strategic_plan/08_capital_projects.htm strategic plan. However, seismic safety problems with Pierce Hall and Thille Hall have pushed the university to redirect their efforts to replacing those buildings, rescuing the structurally simpler (and presumably seismically safe) Leach Hall from demolition until the 20142015 school year at the earliest.



Leach has had a total of THIRTEEN (as of 21307) fire alarm episodes in the 20062007 school year.  Three of these happened on Halloween, spooky.  The problem was finally addressed by Student Housing, a contractor played room raiders for a few days and all is good.
