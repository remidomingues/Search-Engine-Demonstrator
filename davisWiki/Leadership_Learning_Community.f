The Center for Leadership Learning Community was a former program for residents living in the Colleges at La Rue.  It was run by the Center for Leadership Learning.

The Leadership Learning Communitys vision was to develop and cultivate a new generation of leaders through student participation in a thematic based livinglearning community centered upon leadership learning. The program was designed to enhance leadership capacity and civic engagement among undergraduates; refine professional competencies; and increase knowledge and understanding to effectively build diverse relationships and networks.

This undergraduate community fostered intellectual and social growth through student participation in a thematic based livinglearning community centered upon leadership learning. Continuing undergraduate students learned how to refine their repertoire of professional preparation and leadership competencies.

The Aggie Family Pack — a web site for the families of UC Davis students — wrote http://aggiefamilypack.ucdavis.edu/0105/larue.html an article featuring the Leadership Learning Community.

The Leadership Learning Community offered both Academic Community Events (Leadership Learning Seminars, Film & Discussions Series, Diversity Presentations, Guest Speakers, Professional Skill Development Workshops, Presentation/Facilitation Skills Training, Service Learning Opportunities, etc.) and Community Building Events (Quarterly Study Break Celebrations, Movie & Game Nights, BBQs, etc.)
