Note: Real hours are 15 minutes shorter, as you can only use the lab until closing time if youre already there. Printer may be shut off 15 minutes early as well.


The Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) mainly exist as computer labs for those in the dorms. They are stocked with PCs with the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office, the Encarta reference library, and other such Davis Computer Lab fixtures  such as scanner access and Matlab. The LRCs are frequented by those without computers, and those who wish to gain access to their free printing allotment of 150 pages per quarter. This limit is not one which they wish to enforce too heavily, but seemingly just to prevent a few people from printing excessive amounts of pages. The staff do not seem to so much as bat an eyelash at those who print slightly more than the limit, and are supposably willing to grant those who request them more pages.

They normally require users to swipe in before use of their computers  seemingly not to keep track of printing allotments as is rumored, but seemingly is to keep those not from the dorms from having use of them.

Additionally, the LRCs advertise assistance in the use of the Degree Navigator, SISWEB, MyUCDavis, and MELVYL.

Cuarto has two Learning Resource Centers (Emerson and Castilian) seemingly in order to save denizens of Cuarto Castilian Hall/Oxford Circle the long treks that would be required of them to make it to the area LRC should there only be one in one part of Cuarto, and to make sure that they would be used by the maximum number of people possible  something that would not be likely to happen should a large cluster of students feel that their closest one would be too far away to easily reach.

Based upon their webpages seemingly out of date information, the Segundo LRC seems to have been in its present location since when Ye Olde Segundo Dining Commons was the Segundo Dining Commons.
