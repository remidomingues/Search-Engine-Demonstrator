People leaving Davis should consider relocating to one of our Sister Cities.

Leaving Davis is typically what a student does after graduating from UC Davis. You might also leave if you feel like You know you have been in Davis too long if you have been here a little too long.
  I have heard, but cant find it anywhere, that Davis has/had the largest percentage of graduates that remain in the area after graduation.  Users/RogerClark RC

Not to discourage people from Stay In Davis staying in Davis, but if you have already left Davis, leave us your virtual calling card here, say hi, and let us know where you went!

  Users/EvanEdwards and Users/SarahHillard are on the other end of I80, in a small college town in Pennsylvania.  Sarah is pursuing her PhD in Chemistry at Penn State and Evan is pursuing her.  They have vague plans to move back to Davis at some point in the future.

  How far away are we talking about including? I live in West Sacramento which is technically leaving Davis, but I am only the next town over. Is this meant to be those moving beyond the Sacramento/Vacaville/Woodland area? Bay Area?  Users/RogerClark RC
       Id say that if you can make it to an event in Davis without having to arrange for an overnight stay, youre  basically still local.  Users/JessicaLuedtke

  Ill be leaving Davis  and the United States  in two weeks to begin work on my doctorate. Things Ill miss: the Davis wiki, coop, adult learning center, and Delta Venus (especially Irish night). Things I wont miss: the new Target, the ignoramuses who voted for it, the apathetic/transient student population, bland food, marketdriven thinking, the psychics Hummer, neoprimitivism, and liberal elitist hypocrisy. I would consider returning under one condition: if I were offered a tenuretrack position at UCD. Ironically, I think the Davis wiki is the best thing going for Davis, next to a few great professors and their lasting influence (which Ill have to assume exists, based on my undergraduate experience in another state). Salut, everyone!  Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

  Those that do leave Davis ought to seek out other Alumni, depending on the city where they move to. For example, there is a decently sized group of Alumni over in Washington DC. I know this because I briefly visited a few of them in November 2006. I am sure other major cities will have some as well.  Paul Amnuaypayoat
