Lees Deli is a arriving businesses new restaurants restaurant in Davis, featuring a sandwiches sandwich station, noodle soup station, salad bar, Chinese food bar, dim sum, sushi, soup bar, pastries, bagels, and beverages.  They also sell cronots, a hybrid between a croissant and donuts donut, similar to the (trademarked) cronut (but obviously entirely different).  A cronot is a laminated dough torus and is sold for $2.50; some of these have glazes or are rolled in granulated sugar.

How it works: walk in, grab a togo box for your food if you want buffet choices, or approach the soup/sandwich area on the north wall of the restaurant.  Pay for your food on the west wall, and sit at tables all on the south wall of the room.

For buffet choices (the cold stuff is the salad fixings and sushi, the hot stuff is the dim sum and Chinese entrees), you put whatever quantity of items in your box and take it to the register for weighing.  You pay the same pricebyweight ($6.95/lb) for both hot and cold, so it feels like a better $/calorie value for the hot stuff vs the lettuce.  Similar hot/cold buffetinabox options are available at the Food Coop and at Nugget.

Soup: request your noodle (ramen, udon, and a third), request your broth (such as miso, udon, or tonkotsu), and you get the option of adding wontons.  The soup comes in a plastic bowl with various toppings.  On 8/29/13, my ramen had fish cake, pickled daikon, half a baby bok choy, half a hardboiled egg, canned corn, wakame, fresh cilantro, noodles, and broth.  For an upcharge, you can add a few more vegetables, chicken, or char siu to the soup.  There is also soup on the hot buffet which is paid for by volume (akin to Safeway serveyourself soup of the day).

Sandwich: choose your bread, choose your fillings.  Some are preset, others have more flexibility.  It seemed like you can choose whether your meat is heated before being added to the sandwich.

As of 2013, Lees had 11 other locations, primarily in San Francisco (and one in Berkeley).




20130901 19:48:29 nbsp I was not that impressed with the cronots.  First of all, they were not fresh, even though I was there not long after the restaurant opened... they had clearly been refrigerated.  (I dont know if they are made elsewhere and shipped?)  Second, Im a bit of a croissant snob, and these were definitely not light and flaky the way a croissant should be.  Basically, it was not much different from eating an OK but not amazing donut.  Then again, its possible I just dont know what they are supposed to be like.  I was expecting a crullerlike thing, but it was dense like a cake donut.  And for what its worth, I thought they were better with cream than without.  I havent tried their food yet; thats for another day.  Hoping they put some tables outside. Users/CovertProfessor

20130903 14:32:44 nbsp $6.95/lb for hot/cold food.  Didnt think the price was too bad until I filled up my box with what I thought was minimal food and it came out to $7.  I had a very small serving of chow mein (probably about three bites), a fist size of string beans, 5 pieces of broccoli and one Shanghai dumpling.  I wasnt impressed with the taste either.  The string beans were slightly raw.  The Shanghai dumplings werent as juicy as I expected it to be.  The food wasnt great but it wasnt horrific.  But for the price I paid, I feel I would be more satisfied if I walked to Subway, Ohana, Old Teahouse, or Traders Joe.  I didnt try the salad bar or the sandwiches.   Users/BingL

20130912 20:00:35 nbsp Sandwiches are good, classic, large deli sandwiches. Nothing special, so dont expect it to compare to Zias, but decent and well priced.

The hot food buffet had a wide selection, but is way too expensive, and its not very good. If you fill up a togo box about 3/4 of the way youre looking at about $10$15 (under $6 at Hunan for the same amount of food). Just go to Hunan. Users/GarrettGallegos

20131022 00:20:19 nbsp I tried the per pound buffet. I wasnt that bad if you pick the right foods, but for 6.95/lb its not worth it. My 2 eggrolls, 4 peices of orange chicken, 2 shanghai dumplings, 2 siu mai, a small serving of eggplant, curry chicken, steamed fish came out to $13. The steamed fish, eggplant and curry were pretty good but the rest were just average. The orange chicken were way too hard with way too much batter and sauce. The other stuff I didnt get looked either old and dry or not very appealing. The sushi looked worse than the ones from safeway. If you want shanghai dumplings, go to an authentic shanghainese restaurant thats know for them. no other places are good. The only thing that was good was their customer service. Their buffet is a rip off. I definitely wont be going back to Lees Users/shacheung

20140118 14:27:58 nbsp YUM.  I just ate at Lees for the first time. I went for the hot food salad bar.  First the service was excellent  the person at the register and the manager were really friendly and helped guide me through the options. Then the food was great, I especially liked the fish: fresh and not overcooked! Amazing.  I had a filling volume of food on my plate (only premium items, no rice and noodles) and a small soup for $9.50. With the quality of the food, I thought it was a good deal. Ill be back for sure.

20140201 18:33:29 nbsp I go here because I live next to it, otherwise I wouldnt bother. No complaints on the hot bar, but the sandwich I had was super bland. Bland bread, really bland roast beef and mediocre vegetables. Users/ScottB

20140202 23:34:15 nbsp I cannot tell you how much love I have for this place. Getting lunch for the next day for $3 is great, and it comes in the microwavable container too. Also, dim sum in Davis is hard to come by and its pretty okay here. I just dont want everyone in town to know about this to assure I can still get my half off meals. Users/MilesThomas

20140331 21:24:45 nbsp Im going to have to take back the nice things I said about this place. They switched from a paybyweight system to the Panda Express style, where you get 1, 2, or 3 entrees with some starch (like chow mein or fried rice) for a fixed price, and no longer discount the food after 9:00pm.

Its clearly not doing too well by the attendance frequently seen in the restaurant (to say I frequented Lees prior to this change would be an understatement), and it never really marketed itself on campus or in town. Its a shame that they went this route to cover costs rather than branding itself a la Woodstocks. They could have even hired some college students/recent grads as unpaid marketing interns. Goodnight, sweet restaurant.  Users/MilesThomas
