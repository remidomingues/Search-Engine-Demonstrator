Describe LeeBaudoin here.


Visionary person. Interests are:  cultures, musicclassic rock, easy listening, Andrea Bocelli, Stadio, Adriano Celentano (from Italy), classical music, etc., etc. Only interested in sincere peopleotherwise, its a waste of my time.  Lived in Davis years ago and loved it.  Biggest mistakes ever made(1) leaving Davis and (2) letting the love of my life leave.  Could be a beach bum but would suffer from lack of food variety. Like organization and neatness. So really the country life is for meflowers and trees everywhere, privacy and my own space.  Sorry folks theres more but time is almost exhausted to tell you everything. Besides, some things are my own business.  Ciao !
