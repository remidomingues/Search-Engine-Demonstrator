Lee is a Davis resident, a parttime engineer and stay at home mom. She was at http://www.purdue.edu Purdue University for over 6 years earning BS and MS in Civil and Environmental engineering, and is happy to be in sunny California. Lee is also the creator of Bounty and Savings, a local savings website. She is grateful for the excellent school system in Davis, from preschool to elementary schools, and the small town community.

She thinks that patronizing big box stores is not a sin, and by using coupons one minimizes the dollar for dollar impact of buying from chain/big box stores, and leaves more for local farmers market, and local businesses and services.  She donates half of all the free and cheap snacks she got from http://www.bountynsavings.com/category/safeway/ Safeway and http://www.bountynsavings.com/category/target/ Target to her kids schools, which were great, quote from school staff, for kids who havent had breakfast or didnt bring lunch and came to the office asking for food. She has also handed out cookies and shampoos to the homeless around town.
