 Candidate Statement 

Hey everyone!

My name is Lee Lo, (like Lilo & Stitch!) and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the SMART slate. I am currently a second year Political Science major actively involved and passionate about UC Davis! I am running for ASUCD Senate because I believe in empowering students like you to have a voice in ASUCD!

I currently serve as a member of the Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission, an intern for Southeast Asians Furthering Education at the Student Recruitment and Retention Center and a member of the Hmong Student Union. I also continuously outreach to first years as a Foundation for APATH (Asian Pacific American Themed House) Mentorship Board member. As a Senator, here’s a couple things I want to do for YOU!

FREE UNITRANS BUS RIDES ON PICNIC DAY
Picnic Day is the biggest studentrun event hosted on the UC Davis campus and is the day with by far the most amount of students on campus at one time. It is a day in which many UC Davis students take pride in as an Aggie. Currently, all students are charged an additional fee this day to ride the bus, a service already paid for by student fees. This equates to an additional tax on students and their livelihood. I will work closely with Anthony Palmere, the general manager of Unitrans, to explore alternate forms of funding for this day so that students don’t have to worry about another expense!

CREATE A STUDENT GUIDE TO LIVING HEALTHY ON A BUDGET
I will compile a comprehensive guide on how to eat and live healthily on a budget. Too many students go throughout the day either only having one meal or none at all. I have personally witnessed many UC Davis students choosing to not eat because of their financial situation and/or because they do not have the time to simply cook for themselves and, instead, resorting to buying unhealthy fast food that fits in with their schedule. My goal is to create an opportunity to those who don’t see any in their current situation. This comprehensive guide will offer ideas on ways to eat and live comfortably with a low budget. I will work with the nutrition professors and utilize ASUCD resources in order to create this much needed resource guide.

By becoming an ASUCD Senator I vow to work relentlessly for the communities that I love. So be SMART! Vote for the results we will produce together. Vote Lee Lo #1 for ASUCD Senate and SMART #25!
