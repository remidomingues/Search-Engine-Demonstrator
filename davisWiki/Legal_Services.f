At one time or another People we will all need some legal help.  This page is a compilation of some of the many resources available.




 Legal Resources 

 Small Claims Court 
Small Claims Court is a means for individuals to seek redress for their civil grievances without the costs of an attorney.  In small claims actions, neither party may bring an attorneyyoure representing yourself.  In California, small claims court is only available for claims where no more than $7,500 is in disputealthough the court can award more than that as punitive damages.  The winning party can also often recover the costs they incurred on the suit (e.g. the filing fee).

 SelfHelp/Free Resources 
There are a lot of resources available to help you address your own legal problems at little or no cost.  Bear in mind that the law is incredibly complex, and its a big risk to represent yourself.  On the other hand, attorneys are extremely expensive.  If youre retaining a lawyer for a civil suit that you are filing, you will probably be looking at a contingency feerather than charging you on an hourly basis, the lawyer will keep typically between 30% and 40% of whatever you get out of the case.  The advantage of this system is that the lawyer will usually foot all of the costsfiling fees, hiring mediators, process servers, yadda, yadda, so the case costs you nothing unless you win.

  Legal Services of  Northern California provides free legal services in the areas of public benefits, housing (eviction defense, fair housing, general landlord/tenant law), consumer protection (debt collection defense, creditor harassment, contract disputes, identity theft, foreclosure prevention), employment, education (suspension and expulsion defense and special education rights) and simple estate planning for low income people earning less than 200% of federal poverty level and seniors over 60 who live in Yolo County.

  Graduate students Do not currently receive complimentary legal aid through UCD. This service has unfortunately ended and will be discontinued indefinitely.
  The Law Library at King Hall is open to the public.  Its an excellent resource.  Anyone can check out nonReserve books.  Parking is free on the weekends, but you need a UCD parking permit/visitor permit ($6/day as of 2010) during the week.  There are tons of bike racks handy, though.  Outside of academic hours, youll need to use the entrance at the northwest of the building.
  The Sacramento County public law library is located in downtown Sacramento at 8th & I in the old Hall of Justice, right across the street from the Amtrak station.  Meter parking is available nearby; on weekdays, theres valet parking in the basement of the building ($2 per half hour, $20 max for the day).  Diagonally across I Street is another private parking garage ($1.50/half hour, $18 max.  It closes at 6pm, so if you leave after that, its free.  They also have an early bird special, $10 for the day if youre in by 8am).
  The Yolo County Law Library is in Woodland at 204 4th Street.  It is open 9:30am3:30pm Monday through Friday.
  Yolo County has an excellent compilation of useful web resources, available http://www.yolocounty.org/index.aspx?page1260 here.
  The California Courts system has a variety of selfhelp resources.  Most of them are compiled http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/ here.
  (Ill be gradually filling this out with some of the selfhelp clinics, law libraries, referral services, etc. in the area)

 Attorneys and Law Firms 
There are a lot of lawyers out there, some of them good, some of them not.  It can be daunting, trying to pick one.  The best way to find a good lawyer is through the California State Bar website  Legal Specialists search.  Go to www.calbar.ca.gov, click on Legal Specialists on the left, and then under Consumers, click on find a specialist.  State Bar specialists must take and pass a difficult exam in their field of specialty, and must also keep updated in their field in order to maintain their certification.  The next best way is to ask another lawyer in that particular field  perhaps a certified specialist from out of town.  One can also look at Super Lawyers which is a peer recommended and vetted website.  Finally, you can find a lawyer through word of mouthif folks have had a good experience with a lawyer, thats sometimes a good sign, but peer recommendation is better.  You can also look to a California Bar Associationapproved referral service.  Theyll set you up with an initial consultation with a lawyer (in good standing with the bar association  though any lawyer can sign up for the referral service, competency is not a requirement) in your area who practices in the field of law you need.  Different referral services have different fees, but a typical system is $30 for the referral, which will guaranteed you a 30minute consult at no additional cost.  After that, additional time with the lawyer will generally require you to sign a fee agreement.

As a general rule, stay away from lawyers who advertise on television or billboards.
