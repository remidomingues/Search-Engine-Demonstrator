Legubitron struck (ed. for past tense) fear into the hearts of other musicians. As Dan Macht, a guitarist and singer for group, stated before playing a Davis Rock Challenge concert in Spring of 2004,  other bands are already getting scared, theyre already shaking, because our neural pyrotechnics are gonna blow them away; because we fire up the imagination, and they just sit back and watch...theyre about to take some lessons in the school of Legubitron.

The band played all over California and in all likelihood can claim to have fans in practically every hemisphere. If they didnt then the music industry just wouldnt make any sense.

They played the Pirate Ship, the Turtle House, The Graduate, G Street Pub, Delta of Venus, and various other venues.

They were:

  DanMacht (Choadbot) on guitar and vocals  now taking over journalism grad school at NYU.
  Users/EricRuud on bass and vocals  went on to play in the ZimZims and Sholi.
  Users/NicholasBarbulesco on lead guitar and vocals  now playing in The Squid Hickeys.
  GregHagel (Choadbot) on skins and symbols  now playing with The Masons of San Francisco and Sholi.
