Leighton Hinkley was a graduate student in the Department of Psychology (Psychobiology) at UC Davis (20022007).  He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the http://bil.ucsf.edu Biomagnetic Imaging Lab at UC San Francisco.
Leighton also taught General Psychology at UCD before his postdoc.  Hes got much love for Davis.

If you pay close attention, youll notice that Leighton likes to make comments on the Restaurants pages.  Go figure.

Woohoo!
