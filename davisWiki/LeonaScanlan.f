  Leona Dance is Users/SummerSong The Bummers older, identical twin sister.
  She plays Capoeira and will be attending UC Berkeley in the fall to study Toxicology.
  Leona is a frequent visitor to The Bakery.
  Leona could be considered a Hippies hippy and would probably live in The Domes if she attended UC Davis. This is because Leona loves to frolic in nature, eat Organic organic vegetables, garden and talk to animals.
