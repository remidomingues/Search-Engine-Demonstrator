20050729 17:00:46 nbsp I recently got four new tires and a new thingy for the front right part of my axle...anyway theyre really nice and offer nice warranties.  Yippy. Users/SummerSong

20050823 10:06:15 nbsp Ive heard stories of Les Schwab doing crappy work and I know their tires are cheap quality. They dont sell any great brands like Michelin, Bridgestone, BF Goodrich or Goodyear. If you want great service and great, safe tires,  for the cheapest you can find (of that quality) go to the tire center at Costco in Vacaville. Users/ChristopherAdy

20050823 12:08:52 nbsp I agree with Chris. I went to Les Schwab in Vacaville after a fairly new tire I bought from them exploded on the freeway. They didnt seem concerned, as if their crappy tires blow out all the time, it kind of worried me. And my mechanic pointed out a dent I had gotten from an accident on my old car that Les Schwab did nothing about and just put a new tire on. I dont go there anymore, but I did go for the free rotation. Users/MichelleAccurso

20060102 19:05:03 nbsp The Les Schwab tires are generally rebranded of other tires.  I recall that some of their tires are good brands, such as Toyos. Users/JaimeRaba

20060705 20:47:34 nbsp True dat.  Toyos are the best tires.  I always buy them and have never had any trouble with them.  Les doesnt sell Michelin, Bridgestone, BF Goodrich or Goodyear because they are really expensive and suck compared to Toyos.  Get your tires from Les...  Users/SlutMan

20060822 14:48:34 nbsp I recently got a flat tire and Les Schwab patched it for free! No complaints here!! Great, friendly service!! Users/MeBeCarly

20070402 14:16:46 nbsp I had a tire leaking air  turns out it was a nail.  They fixed it for free. Users/DanWillenbring

20070825 09:12:01 nbsp Randy is a really cool guy!  :)

Fair price and prompt work on replacing my rotors.  Well done! Users/Casey

20071107 14:13:22 nbsp As of today, rotation is free (no matter where you bought the tires) and balancing is $12/tire if not purchased from Les Schwab. Users/MattVanGundy

20071212 16:41:40 nbsp These guys are scary good.  I used fixaflat to get a car there (all four tires were in need of replacement, and one was flat).  By the time I parked and got out of the car, one of their technicians was already inspecting the flat tire.  He asked for the keys and directed me to their office.  I had barely started explaining what I wanted to the person inside when the technician came back in.  He had the make, model, year & VIN all written down, gave me some tire options (All Toyos) and within 30 minutes I was out the door with a new set of tires and a bag of fresh popcorn.  I noticed their waiting area also has childrens toys and books.  Great experience.  The only thing keeping them from godlike perfection is that their TV is tuned to Fox News. Users/SteveZ

2008213 nbsp These guys are AWESOME.  I had to go on a long road trip the next day and desperately needed to have my tires rotated.  Not only did they rotate my tires without charging me anything, but they did it in less than halfanhour!  In addition, I had a tire that I periodically had to fill up with air.  I had taken it into a different Les Schwab, and they were unable to find anything.  I told these guys about it, and they were able to find a minute hole in the tire, and fixed it!  If you can, see Troy  hes very professional about everything and extremely helpful.Users/Kipp

20090127 10:42:59 nbsp I really, really like these guys. Highly recommended. Trustworthy, helpful, good service, good people.  Users/lindas

20090128 21:35:19 nbsp I took my car in to get my tires rotated, even though they were not purchased from Les Schwab. I was greeted in the parking lot by an employee, he examined the tires, and took me inside to log my info. into their computer. He did not charge me for the tire rotation and balancing because I had purchased tires from them for my other car. He conducted the tire rotation himself. The store was not excessively busy on the Saturday morning that I visited and my entire visit lasted approximately 20 minutes. I will return to this Les Schwab the next time I need new tires.

20090323 17:38:31 nbsp My roommates and I have all had good experiences here. The employees are polite and willing to explain things, and are generally awesome. They have a huge selection, so they can offer you several different grades of tires, depending on whether you care about durability, warranty, etc. They sell offbrand tires, but that doesnt mean much: most of them come with warranties that meet or exceed those of comparable namebrands.

20100202 16:49:08 nbsp  A+ service!  After an annoying tire repair experience at Vander hamm Goodyear store and I had to get a refund after being lied to and charged for items I did not authorize, I took the tire here and they fixed the air leak at the rim no problem for free and balanced it and only charged me $12.50 after Goodyear charged me $21 and I got nothing but lies, and unbalanced tire and a tire still leaking after they told me it was not leaking.  The people here are very friendly, fast, fair and courteous and they give you what you pay for and more. I bought two tires last month for my small truck for a good price and they are perfect.  They did such a good job above and beyond the call of duty on the tire leak Goodyear could not fix, I went back and gave them a $10 tip. They do have good tire brands as well as economy brands and less expensive than Goodyear or BigO.  Users/cjsg
