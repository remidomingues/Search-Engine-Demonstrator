20101026 22:49:13 nbsp Hi Leslie, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Good to see another local business getting its start here.  Before posting, please be sure to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner welcome page for a load of important information on how businesses and the wiki (with its nonprofit guidelines) interact.  One key point: rather than linking to an outside website, the way to introduce your business to the wiki is to create a new business page for it here.  There, you can introduce the company (from the communitys perspectivesee that link above!), and include a link to your businesss page.  A direct outbound link is a bit on the promotional side, though. Users/TomGarberson
