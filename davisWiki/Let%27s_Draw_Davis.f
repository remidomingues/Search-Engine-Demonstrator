http://letsdrawdavis.wordpress.com/ Lets Draw Davis is a sketchcrawl that takes place monthly in and around Davis. Sketchcrawls are free and open to everyone, all ages and abilities. We meet at a starting point and sketch around a part of Davis, either together or individually, then meet up at an end point to look at each otherâ€™s sketchbooks. All you need is something to draw with and something to draw on! For the date and location of the next sketchcrawl, please click here.

Lets Draw Davis grew out of the worldwide http://www.sketchcrawl.com/ Sketchcrawl movement. Its organized by Davis resident http://petescully.com/ Pete Scully who is also a member of http://www.urbansketchers.org/ Urban Sketchers.
