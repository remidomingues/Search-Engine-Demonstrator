Let Them Eat Cake! is a cupcake and Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods specialty cake shop in Davis that is owned by a mother and her two daughters. At their grand opening they gave away free cupcakes and slices of a twotiered cake they created just for that occasion (as an example of the specialty cakes they make). The bakery uses only the freshest ingredients (no preservatives!).

Let Them Eat Cake! has three daily flavors and a rotating weekly menu, http://www.letthemeatcakedavis.com/faqs.html which they dont put online, but they will get one to you if you make a request for the menu by email or phone. Their menu includes two Vegan cupcakes (on Mondays and Fridays) but more vegan options and gluten free cupcakes are available through special order.  For birthday celebrations birthdays, parties, weddings and other special occasions, the bakery offers cupcake towers and tiered cakes. They also offer Partytogo packages that let you create your own cupcakes! They provide the cupcakes, sprinkles and frosting (which can be colored upon request) and you can have the fun of decorating (and of course, eating) them! Their basic package ($5.50 per person) includes one cupcake per person while their Cupcake Lovers package ($7.50 per person) includes two cupcakes per person.  They also offer gift certificates, so you can help your friends get their cupcake fix without having to guess their favorite flavors!

The shop serves Intelligentsia coffee.

It has recently started serving breakfast, though only on weekends.

Also, for those of you who would like a nice, quiet place to study, work, or just surf the net, Let Them Eat Cake! now has free Wifi for its customers.

For approximately the first two years of its life, Let Them Eat Cake was located at 423 L Street, Suite B, later occupied by Stone Soup Catering & To Go.  It was founded by Paulette, Chelsea, and Brittany Coffman.  New owners took over on March 1, 2014, having acquired the recipes for 50 of the previous owners cupcakes with plans to use others of their own.

Great as special treats to your unsuspecting friends  theyll think youve descended from heaven!




20090902 08:45:59 nbsp Had some cupcakes from them yesterday. YUMMY! My favorite was the daily flavor ...Banana something.. sorry cant remember the cute name but it was a banana cake cupcake with rum infused frosting (very subtle so dont worry youll get too boozy from the frosting). We tried all the flavors and they were great.  Very good texture of the cake and frosting was perfect (not too sweet).  Theyve done a great job renovating their space and it is kind of a fun location tucked away in what is soon to be the Davis Gourmet Ghetto (I am sure it will rival Berkeleys gourmet ghetto). The owners were friendly and energetic and you can tell they real care about what they do.  Go check it out! Users/HeatherMartin

20090908 20:57:24 nbsp I like how the their URL can read, let the meat cake. Meat cakes, yum. Please fix your images on your website! I would like to see the meat cakes. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20090910 16:40:31 nbsp Mmmm...the Dubliner...chocolate with guinness.  Delicious!  This place is adorable, and the two girls there were extremely sweet.  Their workspace is pretty open behind the counter, so you can see the baking process while devouring your cupcake and sipping your coffee.  GO!!! Users/AlyssaOlenberg

20090910 20:56:07 nbsp Question: Do they deliver or will they send in mail? I have a cousin who might like to have a batch of the Dubliners. They sound fantastic! Users/jsbmeb

20090912 11:50:50 nbsp We heard about this place by word of mouth.  Took awhile to find it, the signs helped.  Just stopped by last night, I had Scarlett (Red Velvet + cream cheese frosting) and my fiance had the Dubliner.  Cupcakes were moist and baked to perfection.  Not overly sweet and not piled with a ridiculous amount of frosting that usually plague cupcake places.  Great place, I hope they do well.   Users/JenAndWinston

20090915 13:27:29 nbsp I think it is great that there is a bakery in town that features vegan cupcakes. I tried to buy one today on a whim and was told I needed to special order or show up on a Monday or Friday. I think that if the business is going to advertise that they offer something then they should make sure they have it available. I would suggest making at least one of your daily cupcakes vegan for customers just dropping by. I definitely went away disappointed but look forward to giving them a second chance. Users/CarenRoma

20090919 16:15:38 nbsp Oh my god these are good cupcakes!!!  And I dont even particularly like cupcakes! Users/lilhaf

20090919 20:17:42 nbsp Yum!  Their cupcakes are wonderful, so much better than what you get in the supermarket.  Great, inventive flavors. Users/lemurific

20090919 20:41:36 nbsp Any chance of importing cake recipes from overseas such as some variety of Kleckselkuchen (German)?  Granted, it is no cupcake but the article did mention twotiered cake.  Sounds like a rather innovative store. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090920 09:48:08 nbsp My best friend and I tried this place the other day and it was fantastic!  The owners were super nice and helpful, and the cupcakes were super yummy!  I had the cookie dough and she had the apple...she is not a cupcake fan either, and thought it was really good.  I hope that they do really well here, despite being off the beaten path...maybe we can convince them to move downtown?  I would study there every day!  (dangerous, but possibly good for some of the gyms in town...).  Tell your friends and stop by!!! Users/UCDvetstudent

20090927 12:28:05 nbsp I just discovered this place yesterday and was SO excited as I LOVE cupcakes. I have to say the cupcakes themselves are delicious but the frosting is mediocre. I had the Scarlet, the chocolate, and vanilla. Like I said, the cake
partvery deliciousbut they should create a new recipe for frosting...I plan on going back to try the vegan cupcakes. Users/lgrote

20090928 14:46:54 nbsp These are seriously the best cupcakes in the Sac area...Ive tried cupcakes from every cupcake bakery around. The flavors are inventive and taste just like theyre supposed to, without being over the top. The cake is moist and crumbly, the frosting flavorful and not too sweet. Ive had all 3 of the daily flavors but my favorites so far are the Amy Winehouse (chocolate orange), the dark chocolate peanut butter one (Junes flavor of the month but the owner made a special batch and I lucked out), the banana split one, the Apple Hill (apple & spice) and the Cookie Monster (cookie dough inside the cake!). I loved the honey cake part of the Doodlebug but the lavender frosting was a bit much for me. I cant wait to try some of the other weekly flavors! I keep missing the Smores one and the PB&J one. Gotta get in there and feed my cupcake addiction! Users/davispigeon

20090928 15:53:12 nbsp Everyone else seems to love these cupcakes, so I went with high hopes expecting to love them.  But I didnt like them much, and neither did any of the people I was with.  We tried the vanilla, the banana (had some sort of jam in it?) and chocolate with Guinness in it.  I wasnt impressed with the flavors, and they all seemed very sweet.  (And Im not the sort of person who generally thinks things are too sweet).  In all honesty, I prefer your average bake sale cupcake or even the cupcakes at the Davis Creamery.  Maybe we just didnt try the right flavors?  Im willing to give them another shot  if I like them better a second time, Ill come back and revise my comment. Users/CovertProfessor

20091001 23:03:32 nbsp 5 Stars!!!!
I dont even really like cake, and I love this shops cupcakes.  The cake actually tastes as described (such as root beer) and the frostings are not too sweet. The Amy Winehouse (chocolate orange) is very good and the Smores one because the chocolate cake was deep and dark. The June flavor of the month is a peanut butter/chocolate which is a MUST have. Request it and maybe she will add it to the weekly rotation.
All this place needs is an ATM/credit card machine and a cooler full of milk.  Users/Lfein

20091003 14:00:40 nbsp Ever since I had my first cupcake their a few days ago, I cant stop thinking about going back!!  Their cupcakes are delightfully, and perfectly, sweet and creamy!  Their location is a bit odd, and bad for foot traffic (as earlier mentioned, its a bit ghetto).  Im hoping they look to do some remodeling or painting on the outside of their building as business picks up (which it will with cupcakes these good!).  Will definitely go again, and I have already recommended it to all of my friends! Users/tuckerm

20091007 23:06:08 nbsp I like this place and will continue to support it with my business. Part of that comes from my love of cupcakes, another part of it comes from my appreciation of what this bakerys about. I love the motherdaughters startup cupcake bakery concept, and I admire the work and creativity that went into the place. However, I really think this place would survive better in a more central downtown location that would draw people in who were just walking by, instead of only attracting customers who know where theyre going. That said, I wish them success and I cant wait til Ive visited for every day of the week to try all the flavors! So far Ive got four days down and two more to go! :) Sometimes they have cookies which are amazing too! I love the scarlett, pineapple express, twilight, and their seasonal flavors have been great (pumpkin, gingerbread..) I also heard something about a chocolate peanut butter one but I never got to try it, hope itll come back. Users/SRB

20091013 11:17:09 nbsp I came here for the first time yesterday and was very impressed! As a vegan, I had to try their Vegan Chai cupcake and it was AMAZING. Moist, creamy, perfectly spicy and not overly sweet. My friends were very impressed with their nonvegan cupcakes too. I sincerely appreciate any effort at all to provide for different diets, no matter how disastrous the outcome, but Let Them Eat Cake actually makes REALLY GOOD vegan cupcakes. I hope theyll be able to create some more signage directing people toward the shop because its a tough place to find! If they were located downtown, business would be booming already!! Users/ChrissyNoble

20091014 15:04:40 nbsp I am vegan and also give 5 stars to the vegan chocolate cupcake. However, they either need to lower the price or make the cupcakes BIGGER... am I the only person that thinks $2.75 is an awful lot for a SMALL cupcake? I would love to frequent this store often but sadly cannot afford it except for the occasional treat.  Users/Nancycat

20091101 15:08:27 nbsp Awesome stuff, split a Bannana is good complete with jelly center and can honestly say its the best cupcake I have ever The thing they need now is some kind of sign outside so everyone can find them, and maybe borrow some chairs from the place next door for outdoor seating Users/CraigFergus

20091110 15:58:01 nbsp Best. Cupcakes. Ever. My friend and I had the Cheesey Monkey and the Acai Berry muffin. Will update and report on the Amy Winehouse cupcake this Friday...mm. Users/AlvinTsao

20091115 13:14:52 nbsp I went there yesterday and location was a bit tricky. But upon finding them, I chose the Scarlett cupcake. Its essentially a Red Velvet cheesecake. First Impression: Looks yummy, Not too big but not small either. Lots of frosting. Smells...weird? It took me a while to pinpoint it but the cream cheese frosting actually smells like REAL cheese, not cream cheese. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing. It definitely doesnt smell like any other cream cheese frosting Ive had. Now for the taste test: DELICIOUS! The cake portion and yes, the cream cheese frosting complemented each other very well. It was not overly, artificially sweet like other cupcakes. It was just right. I also tried the cake and the frosting separately. The cake itself was moist, the flavor was so good and not bright red (sometimes red velvet cakes have the appearance of a bloody bright red which is not appealing). The cake color itself was a dark burgundy red. Their cream cheese frosting was so soft, melts in your mouth and seriously not TOO sweet. (#1 reason why I dont like frosting)It was not dry or hard like you would see with other frostings. Personally, it was not too heavy a frosting but I wouldnt mind having it a lighter, whipped frosting.

I cant wait to try the other ones! I hope they are all as good as this one.  Users/KimN.

20091123 19:14:26 nbsp This place is delicious! Their icing/topping/whatever is on time of the cupcake is delicious and makes the cupcake so much more enjoyable. Im definitely happy about having a decent cupcake place around! Will come back! Users/ElizabethLee

20091128 19:43:49 nbsp These place smells like wet dog.  Users/DolceVita

20091208 10:34:21 nbsp So good.  I have had the dubliner and the chocolate chip cookie dough and the happy daze and they were all incredibly good.  Please support local businesses! Users/mmangrum

20091208 17:14:48 nbsp This shop is located in an odd place and the entrance was a little confusing to find.  I had the Dubliner cupcake upon recommendation and it was orgasmic.  Usually I find that cupcakes are too sweet and too dry.  The cupcake I had was moist and perfectly flavored.  My only complaint is that the cupcake was too small and I didnt have enough money to buy more.  From now on, this will be my shop to go to for a little snack, or a celebration cake.  Highly recommended.   Users/BenLee

20091217 23:00:29 nbsp Anyone have any idea what they do with all the cupcakes they dont sell each day? I was there almost at closing time and they display case was FULL. I hate to imagine them in the garbage? Not to sound ignorant but really have no idea. Users/SRB

20091218 10:03:28 nbsp I asked the exact same question, the owner told me that they donate them (she mentioned the location, but I forget now. Im a big supporter of this shop, not only is it local and very mom and pop theres also professionalism and great service. I have been back 45 more times, and plan to come at least twice a month, and have nothing negative to say.  Users/AlvinTsao

20100112 17:20:07 nbsp This saddens me to write, as I initially really liked this place.  But, after 3 unfortunate visits, I will no longer give them my business.  During these last visits, I have never felt more unwelcome.  When I entered this small shop, no one greeted me or even said a single word to me, other than what the price was after I picked out my cupcakes.  Actually, I really felt that they would rather me not even come in and give them my business.  So strange, especially since they are a new small business.  And it was the owners who treated me this way.  While I would typically chalk this up to an isolated event, this occurred on the last 3 out of the 7 or so times than I have been there.  Even my husband was astounded by their poor attitudes.  I will stick to my own cupcakes from now on. Users/lemurific

20100112 17:51:51 nbsp Wow, these cupcakes are amazing! I went here this morning and scarfed a Scarlett on the spot. Even though they sell bottled water they were nice enough to give me a cup of tap water. I bought a Dubliner and ate it at home. It was also very tasty, so I went back again and bought another Scarlett! These cupcakes are really tasty. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100112 22:19:51 nbsp These cupcakes are amazing. Theyre definitely a guilty pleasure... but the beauty of it is that theyre so satisfying that youll never have to worry about inhaling a dozen of them in one sitting  one or two is plenty! I really hope this place sticks around. Users/MichellePalmer

20100116 16:24:31 nbsp Great cupcakes! I only wish they would offer a better deal when you buy a dozen or more. Users/Sherri

20100117 14:16:33 nbsp Normally we shy away from posting comments, as most posts reflect personal opinions which are as unique as each individual posting them. While one person may say too much frosting, another may say perfect balance of frosting to cake, etc. That said, I simply cannot ignore the post made by lemurific who states, ...I have never felt more unwelcome...no one greeted me or said a single word to me... I can say with all confidence that we greet each and every customer, many whom we know by name, and are very friendly to all of those who visit our shop. We are a family business, and strive to treat our customers like friends or family as well. Even during our busiest times, we greet each customer (though perhaps we may let them know that we will be with them in just a moment), often letting them know what our flavor of the month is, or what our Saturday Surprise flavor is. We would NEVER make a customer feel unwelcome (we have even been polite and gracious to loud drunks!). One of my daughters is a bit shy, and not quite as outgoing as the other; she might stand quietly by letting the customer browse our selections, but she is never rude or unwelcoming and has a smile for everyone who comes through the door. I invite you all to stop by and see for yourself; we love what we do, we love sharing our creations with our customers, and most of all we love getting to know all of you! Users/pcoffman

20100125 16:04:13 nbsp Since the owner does not wish to acknowledge that their service is less than perfect, and the fact that I felt so unwelcome on multiple occasions, I will clarify and expand upon my above comment.  The last time I came in to the shop was with my husband, about an hour and a half before closing.  Again, just to clarify from the owner’s comment, we were not even drunk or obnoxious.  We were just a happy couple on their date night who really wanted one of their tasty cupcakes.  When we came in, the shop was empty, the owner and her daughters were sitting down on one of their cafe tables, clustered around their laptop.  All three of them looked up at us, didn’t say a word, and continued to look at their computer screen.  There was no smile, no greeting, and definitely no mention of what the “flavor of the month is, or what our Saturday Surprise flavor is”, there was NOTHING.  After some time, the owner sent her daughter to take care of us.  She just stood behind the counter, no words were even spoken.  After we told her what we wanted, she gave us our cupcakes, told us the total price, and took our money.  Perhaps she is shy, as the owner admits.  That is good to know, so thanks for the clarification.  But, honestly, it was the owner herself that made us feel so unwelcome.  When you enter an empty, very small owner’s shop and they never ever say a word to you, don’t crack a smile, and don’t really acknowledge you, how are you supposed to feel?  Isn’t it awkward?   We felt completely unwelcome and obtrusive.  And, this is not the first time that I have felt this way.  Comparatively, I get better service at the bakery counters at Safeway and The Nugget.  Shouldn’t you expect more and not less from a small business owner?  What is much worse is that the owner doesn’t even care to acknowledge that she could possibly be unfriendly or unwelcoming at any point in time.  It is as if she is dismissing my comment altogether.  An apology would have been better.  It is unfortunate because I really enjoy their cupcakes.  I WAS a repeat customer. Users/lemurific

20100126 23:04:28 nbsp Once again I find myself pondering whether or not to reply to a post. On one hand, it would seem wise to simply let sleeping dogs lie, but on the other it seems wiser to defend our reputation and our business philosophy of providing the best possible customer service while making the best cupcakes and cakes imaginable! To that end, I will once again address lemurific. Her first post troubled me deeply, and I spent much time wracking my brain trying desperately to recall any instance when I would have ignored a customer or been less than friendly under any circumstances.  Then I read the most recent post by lemurific and it all became clear. She is not complaining that I did something wrong, she is complaining that I simply did nothing. She states that, when the bakery was empty we were using our laptop computer; we do in fact use a laptop to order supplies, correspond with customers, keep the books, and plan cake designs for upcoming orders. She goes further to state that she was not greeted, which is a point that I still contest, and that I sent my daughter to take care of her. She makes the point that the owner of a small business did not help her personally, and this seems to be the focus of her discontent. Ironically, an owner did in fact help her; both of my daughters are equally invested owners in our business. So, when lemurific visited, although one or two of the owners were perhaps taking advantage of a quiet moment to tend to other bakery business, another owner gave her full attention to taking care of a customer. While many business owners will delegate such duties to an employee when they are otherwise engaged, at our bakery you can always count on an owner serving you. If some of us are busy baking, decorating cakes, or tending to other bakery duties which prevent us from interacting with our customers directly, the others step in and provide customer service. The mere fact that some of us might be otherwise engaged in various duties does not equate to poor customer service, rudeness, or ignoring customers; it simply means that we are focusing on other tasks and our customers are being cared for by another one of us. However, in spite of these facts, the bottom line is that the customer is always right  regardless of what they are saying. That is the basic foundation of good customer service, and one we live by. At the end of the day, I know that I pour my heart and soul into our bakery six days a week. I know that my daughters do the same, all while being full time students. I know that we strive to provide excellent customer service, and truly love getting to know each of our customers (many of you are more like family!). Sadly, I also know that lemurific believes that she was treated poorly and that is what matters. So, if you are listening lemurific  I offer you my sincerest apology. I hope that you will someday visit the bakery again, and discover that we truly do strive to provide the best experience possible for all of our customers. Users/pcoffman

20100128 17:38:18 nbsp I finally got the chance to visit this place today and I must say in response to the posts above that the owner was very friendly.  I was by myself and she made an effort to strike up a conversation with me and was happy to tell me about the business including their suprise flavors, how their menu rotated daily, their facebook page etc.  She was exceptionally nice.  Also, I have tried cupcakes from many, many places and I must say that this was the best cupcake that Ive ever had.  They even top sprinkles.  Theyre rather smaller than most other places and I actually like that, but feel like perhaps the price should reflect that a little.  Nevertheless I will definitely be back on a very regular basis!  One other request  post the menu online.  Perhaps Im just missing it somewhere? Users/5thAve

20100204 16:19:24 nbsp I was stoked to check out this little shop. Delicious! Its smaller than the usual cupcake (but ure not missing out)... perfect richness, size, and flavor! I had the Bollywood (chai cake and chai cream cheese frosting). Im excited to try all the other flavors!
O and leasing a place downtown is way too expensive, so I dont expect them to move! Go support their business by word of mouth!! Users/SaThai

20100306 18:58:38 nbsp I came here with my mother and father and we all shared a Cookie Monster and another one whose name escapes me, but it featured a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting, with chopped bacon placed on top.  Im no expert on cupcakes, but they were some of the best Ive ever had.  Both were extremely sweet.  The Cookie Monster was very buttery, with some cookie doughy stuff inside that made it very tasty.

What really impressed me though, was the chocobacon one.  I bit into this cupcake, and was overwhelmed by sugary chocolate... just as I was about to dismiss it as too sweet, the bacon cut into the sugar and chocolate and added some much needed saltiness.  Cupcakes are generally a rather simple experience, but this one really blew my mind.  The girls here arent just working with a flavor, theyre working with a slightly longer food experience in the shape of an innocent cupcake.  It was great.

At $2.75 per cupcake, Im not exactly going to return everyday... but as a nice treat or gift to someone special, I will keep this place in mind. Users/BrandonWong

20100421 19:19:16 nbsp Ive always wondered about this place. I stopped by today about 3o min before closing time, and unfortunately, they were pretty much sold out of all of their cupcakes. I did manage to snag the second to last chocolate/bacon cupcake (which was DELICIOUS)! Their cupcakes are average size cupcakes, and I felt that they were fairly priced considering how yummy the cupcake was. I will definitely visit again! Users/AndreaG

20100429 15:18:29 nbsp Got a giant chocolate chip cookie and a red velvet cupcake. An orgasm inside of my mouth Users/Ldish949

20100513 11:16:29 nbsp Finally tried this place. Ended up getting (4) instead of 1 cupcake because I couldnt decide. Woofed down (2) immediately, its so good and worth the splurge! Also great as special treats to your unsuspecting friends for coffee meetups Users/LeeY

20100521 12:27:01 nbsp This place rocks! I love the smores cupcakes (available only on Mondaysbummer). The vanilla and chocolate frostings are great, but Im not a huge fan of the cream cheese frostinga little bitter for me. The cake is super moist and the cupcakes are reasonably priced. At this point, Ive tried nearly every flavor but I always come back for the Illegally Blond (vanilla cake w/ vanilla frosting), and the Smores, I think its called the happy camper or something similar.  Users/ces139

20100523 14:05:41 nbsp Their cupcakes are very good (the use of butter instead of shortening is really noticeable).  Theres definite room for improvement with regard to stocking the shop though  Ive come by on two separate occasions to find the shop closed due to heavy sales that day.  Please bake more cupcakes than you need and sell the surplus the next day at cost (or discounted to some degree) so the store can keep regular hours. Users/cfb

20100607 00:32:08 nbsp in love with this cupcake place! Its hidden but definitely stop by, worth the money also.
if its your first time, try the dubliner or one of their many other flavors of the day
the girls behind the counter are always very friendly, i come in every now and then and will continue to! Users/melamazing

20100721 20:39:56 nbsp The pineapple express and the blueberry cupcake were delicious. I let my mom take a small bite and after a second, she took another huge bite. She left me with only half. (  Users/KRSanta88

20100923 10:12:08 nbsp I am not a cupcake fan and I scoff at the recent cupcake craze.  However, these are some DAMN GOOD cupcakes, very rich and very tasty. Always fresh with some very interesting and flavorful taste combinations. The chocolate chip cookies are also very good. Awesome coffee, a very good light roast with smooth flavor. One of the best date places in town. Users/DagonJones

20100924 19:35:51 nbsp Stopped by a few days earlier to check out the place. Came back today and bought Twilight (corn cupcake with cream cheese frosting) with a coupon from one of those coupon books they keep giving away on campus. It was deliciousvery fresh tasting, and the cupcake was not so overly sweet that I went into a sugar coma after comsumption. The cream cheese was very cheesy tasting unlike more conventional cream cheese frosting at somewhere like a Safeway Bakery or in a container in the baking isle.  I will be back. Scarlett seems to be a popular flavor as they were all sold out around 4pm. Users/heatherbreen

20101004 22:04:38 nbsp Its a bummer that vegan cupcakes arent available every day. Ive gone twice and both times they did not have them. I should have read the website before going, but I assumed they would have at least one vegan flavor available since it is Davis.  Users/EricaMacGregor

20101022 17:06:51 nbsp In a word, AMAZING! These women know how to make a truly exceptional cupcake. I have frequented this cupcake shop for about a year now and keep discovering new and delicious flavors! I love love love their vegan chocolate cupcake and today I tried the root beer cupcake and the special when in rome cupcake. Both of these cupcakes were incredibly good! The women that own the shop are sweet and always super friendly. There frosting is tasty without being too sweet. I have not had a cupcake here that I didnt love! Keep it up ladies! I look forward to my cupcakes every week! So yum yum yummy! Users/DavisBirthDoula

20101204 17:29:53 nbsp Bummed they dont have GF cupcakes, other than by special order. I assume to make a special order I have to by a bunch and not just a few...anyone know? I tasted some frosting from my husbands cupcake and it was tasty, not too sweet. But alas, I was really bummed to walk out cupcakeless.  Users/AmLin

20101230 14:07:28 nbsp To the owner of Let them Eat Cake, dont dwell for one minute on the (VERY sparse) negative feedback on this page!  I have been to your shop many times since you opened and have experienced nothing but warm welcomes from you and your lovely daughters.  Your cupcakes are simply sublime and I wish you the best of luck!

20110420 08:00:19 nbsp The dubliner is amazing, and it doesnt taste like beer, it just does something very unique to the flavor. Just like my pancakes (aka crepes) where I use 5050 milk and dark beer, where people dont go it tastes like beer but wow, how do you make it taste like that???. The merlot cake is also divine.
And it is a nice place to enter, they treat you like family.

20110514 00:11:42 nbsp I often read comments on Davis Wiki to get a general expectation. However, reading this page does not sum up my disappointment with Let Them Eat Cake. A friend of mine, and recent graduate of UC Davis, placed an order of 12 cupcakes to be delivered to my apartment for my birthday. She scheduled the drop off for 1pm, however, when placing the order, she was asked for an alternative drop off time. My friend, hard pressed, said 6pm would be okay  but she expected the delivery to take place at 1pm (her REQUESTED delivery time). Around 6, I received a phone call and still no cupcakes have shown up....until 6:48. The delivery guy said he got lost in the apartment complex  which can be understandable  but 48 minutes worth?? I dont think so. Not only was my friends, a paying customer, requested delivery time ignored  it was almost one HOUR later than the alternative delivery time! Now, I dont know if the shop was busy, if they had some sort of problem they needed to deal with, or what  but if you give the customer an option about when they want them delivered and request an alternative in case of some problem...shouldnt either one ATLEAST be met?
The dozen cupcakes looked really nice and I was really looking forward to taking a bite into one! My friend couldnt remember what flavors she ordered so I looked online to find some sort of menu...which there is none (and I can respect the owners decision to keep their work private) so it was a blind taste test. However  two of the cupcakes were vegan due to my boyfriend having a severe dairy allergy. But the vegan cupcakes were not marked and out of a dozen cupcakes and no menu  how can you be sure? This isnt something you can just play around with! Quite a disappointment!! Since I have only recently received my delivery, I tasted two of the cupcakes. The first one had a cinnamonlike frosting and the other was a traditional red velvet. The cinnamon was really interesting and unique but the red velvet left much to be desired. Their frosting was just soso and the cupcake did not taste like anything at all. Im trying to mark this disappointing discovery to just being full  but I have had cupcakes professionally done and these make it to the bottom of my list. Very disappointing to both myself, my cupcakehungry boyfriend, and my friend who ordered the dozen for me. Overall  I sadly regret that my friend even placed an order through this business. I love to support local businesses in Davis but this one was just a disappointment.

It seems there are quite a few customers that enjoy the cupcakes though  so it may just be my personal taste...but their delivery service and cupcake packaging (in regards to the unmarked vegan cupcakes) were just ridiculous. Users/tracyc

20110526 17:42:18 nbsp Even though $2.75 for a cupcake is pretty expensive, this place is still great and worth coming to in order to satisfy the sweet tooth.  The Dubliner is easily my favorite cupcake.  While I havent tried all of the flavors yet, I doubt that any of them would come close to the Dubliner, although the Blonde cupcake is pretty yummy as well.  I ordered a birthday cake from them about 18 months ago, and although I thought the cake was fine, the owners said they messed it up a little so they threw in like 6 extra cupcakes.  Yay.  They have friendly service and I shall continue to be a patron so long as I have money in my wallet.   Users/BenLee

20110531 18:34:08 nbsp Had some cupcakes from them a couple of weeks ago. I got the Scarlett and Dubliner, the Scarlett was amazing! The cake is so moist and the cream cheese frosting is to die for. The Dubliner however, I didnt care much for. I could taste the beer in it, and I just didnt care for it. Not the less, a great place to get cupcakes. You will love it!  Users/CheyenneMaine

20110603 17:10:20 nbsp Mediocre cupcakes, terrible service. Ill agree with the poster who said Ive never felt so unwelcome at a business.  When I walked in, there were three individuals behind the counter, no one stirred upon noticing a customer had entred.  When went up to the counter and made eye contact with one person, she reluctantly walked over to wash her hands. As I was walking out someone mumbled  have a nice day which may win the least sincere greeting award.   I also asked for a bag since it was raining outside, my request was declined.  I can only assume this place is popular because theres no competition for a cupcake place in town.  Their version of red velvet cupcake (scarlet) was OK.   The frosting tasted like straight cream cheese, the cake was unremarkable but satisfactory.   Users/ZeeZee

20110609 17:35:12 nbsp The new shop looks very sketchy to me and it is located at the side of a building.  I was very scared of entering the cupcake shop but seeing how it was the only one in Davis with good reviews I went in anyways.   I didnt really get a welcoming feeling when I went in, the atmosphere was not very warming or welcoming. The room was dim with light grayishblue and tinted lighting; it was like being in a horror movie. However, I was greeted with a welcome.  The selection of cupcakes looked almost all the same except for the colors, but I thought to myself, hey its not only about presentation if it tastes good right? So I bought a Dubliner cupcake... which disappointed me, the frosting was good but the cake was very bland and almost too mushy in my mouth as I chewed.  The texture of the cupcake completely threw me off.  Maybe next time if I ever go back there, Ill try something different.

20110610 15:21:11 nbsp Finally had a chance to get over and treat my family to cupcakes, only to find the place closed this afternoon for a private party.  That was a huge bummer!  A business should be open during normal hours, or somehow able to accommodate customers.  There was no indication when the store would open again, just the shades drawn and a note that said private party.  Good cupcakes, sure, but seriously lacking in professionalism today! Users/ElisaAllechant

I am terribly sorry about the confusion about our hours that day. We had put up a sign saying Private Event to indicate that we had closed in order for everyone at LTEC to attend my graduation (as a family owned and operated business, we had no one to run the shop while my mom, Paulette, and sister, Chelsea, attended my graduation from UCD).  We realize that this sign was confusing, and although we had prepared by putting up a notice on our website, Facebook, and in the shop itself, we should have put up a clearer sign. We hope you visit us again soon  we are open 7 days a week now, with the hours updated here on Wiki.

Sincerely,
Brittany

20110711 14:06:25 nbsp I think I can say I was the first to taste the Sunday special flavours (as a customer) and in one blow they knocked my favourite Dubliner down to 3rd place, with the new RAVEN and POG being no 1 and 2, respectively :) I actually uttered wow when I took my first bites and having a nice cup of coffee. The worst about this place is that they open up so late, so I cant have my morning coffee there every day as I go to work.. well.. maybe its good for my health :)
Ive just noticed people complain about the service and I think that it has that familiar (know who you are) atmosphere that I always miss when I shop in Denmark. The new place does feel incomplete, and it is, but so far with teh direction they are heading, it looks awesome. Maybe switch out the flourescent light tubes with nice beautiful warm lights to match the ancient decorations?  Users/MichaelNielsen

20110731 23:33:47 nbsp Ive enjoyed the couple of cupcakes Ive had, and I think the new C Street location is adorable. I appreciate the quiet politeness of the girl(s) whove served me; Im not looking for any kind of extravagant sell or handholding when I walk into a cupcake shop. Pleased also about the WiFi/tables at the new place.

Recently I had my mother in town to help me out after an injury. I was stoked to take her for some fun foods in town, but despite the NOW OPEN sign we found the bakery closed on our first visit, in the middle of the day, during business hours, with no explanation. It was a little disappointing, and if a shop is going to close during business hours, whether for family matters or having sold out, a clear notice on the door helps maintain customer trust.

Im totally curious about how the Amy Winehouse cupcake sales have fared. Users/Willikers

20110919 17:53:14 nbsp For what everyones saying about the customer service, Id say the workers and owner are a little bit spacey but they arent being deliberately mean. Not every shop has to be inyourface bubbly like InnOut or something.

Ive had good experiences with them the couple times I went there and the Rosemarys Baby cupcake is soooo good! No one should be afraid to buy it... Its 20x better than the Dubliner or the Scarlett! Users/sundeimasu

20111009 13:21:43 nbsp Yes, this is a superior bakery but I have to state up front that at the old Let Them Eat Cake location I too felt at times the customer service left much to be desired. Trying to strike up a conversation about flavours and special orders after making a purchase once was like pulling teeth, so I discontinued trying to park near their odd location. After a break, Ive been to the new location numerous times now (much, much nicer space) and the owner still has not said hello and acknowledged me if she is upfrontNOT ONCE. Ive shopped at stores where even rude cranky owner will still say hello! It is an acknowledgement of thanks and gratitude even if they are knackered and busy. However the man at the counter is very kind. This is a tough economy and I am all about supporting local businesses so while I do not expect coddling and fawning I do want to feel a sense of community. At this point Im there because the product is so superior. As for the product? I dont think they make one bad cupcake. They could lay off the icing in the sugar just a tad and still keep the icing delicious but that criticism is minor; they really know how to make a cupcake which is moist, filling and flavourful. I will continue to support this local Davis business and hope that the owners simply learn to be more effusiveeven when busy. Users/MaryCarroll

20111112 21:53:59 nbsp Ok cupcakes, the pumpkin one is good. But I expect my chocolate cupcake to actually taste like chocolate. Especially for their prices. Sugar Daddys is better, and has more variety. Guy behind the counter was a little creepy. probably wont be coming here again. Users/AlexandraS

20111121 14:28:37 nbsp I am a HUGE dessert fan and Ive tried many cupcakes, but this place is my absolute FAVORITE!  I made a wiki just to comment this place.  The texture is moist/light & the frosting is amazing.  I believe Ive almost tried their whole menu and Im so glad they have frequent customer cards now.  My favorite cupcake is the French Toast one!  I LOVE this place and when I get married I definitely know Im ordering from here! ;) Users/sanonymous

20120106 15:33:18 nbsp Theyre a bit too expensive. I do love a moist cupcake, but Im not sure if theyre worth the price.  Users/OliviaGlass

20120131 16:28:43 nbsp I went here yesterday with a housemate and ended up getting so many cupcakes. One of my housemates really loves the Scarlett. She says its the best red velvet shes had and shes quite picky with her sweets. I really liked the Smores cupcake. I will be returning soon to try other flavors! Users/ElaineJeu

20120229 21:46:31 nbsp Started visiting this place at the old ghetto (not at all ghetto, dear Davisites...) location as soon as I spied it on a walk one day. Loved it from the start! REAL cream cheese frosting that is actually creamy instead of gaggingly sweet (see: grocery store cupcakes). I have yet to get through all the flavors but I really enjoy Apple Hill and Cookie Monster (Saturday flavors), and a special vanilla one with blackberry frosting they had the other day. Their cupcakes make my day.  Theyre always moist yet crumbly with just the right amount of sweetness.
As for the customer service, I have to agree on one level with some of the negative comments here. The part I dont agree with is where it will keep me away. I understand that people are different and not everyone is the outgoing or bubbly personality type. This isnt a popularity contest; its a cupcake bakery. And their cupcakes are WORTH IT. Sometimes, I have gone away feeling a bit peeved at how much the person working there that day brushed me off like an annoyance, but as soon as I take a bite of the cupcake it all melts away. Im not saying this should be ignored, though. If they want to make it in a place like Davis, theyre going to have to pick up some slack on the customer service front. Its not everyone who works there, but one or possibly two people in particular I think. And its not outright rudeness, its an underthesurface hurry up, I have other things to do kind of attitude. I can handle it. The rest of Davis, perhaps not. Please take some constructive criticism, LTEC, if there are those among the family who prefer not to deal with customers, dont make them. Put the ones up front to whom a friendly demeanor comes more easily. Otherwise youre going to have more butthurt customers who are probably being overly sensitive, but are valuable clientele nonetheless. That said... BOTTOM LINE: AMAZING CUPCAKES. Users/gurglemeow

20120311 17:18:33 nbsp Adorable location, great coffee, lovely cupcakes! I will be returning many times over. Users/BombayCollins

20120321 20:15:39 nbsp Ive been here several times now. I have to say the cupcakes are only worth it when I have a Groupon or some other such discount. Otherwise, they are way overpriced. For example, I got luck o the Irish today and it just tasted like a vanilla cupcake with cream cheese frosting. Why did I pay $2.75 for something I could make at home, when I came for something unique? I actually thought they mixed up which flavor was what, but the guy working there said he mixed the frosting himself. I couldnt taste even a hint of Baileys, though.

On another note, apparently they have had a frequent buyer stamp card for almost two years. Today was the FIRST time I have ever been offered one  I didnt even know they existed. This is pretty annoying because I would have earned a free cupcake or two by now. Maybe the women who work there never offered the card because theyre trying to save money, or maybe its just another symptom of the way they treat customers (I would classify their behavior as aloof/brusque, rather than intentionally rude but I have witnessed this from them on each visit, like several others on this page). Either way, the owner and her daughters could take a lesson from the friendly guy who was working today. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120403 16:52:59 nbsp Since my last comment Ive been in about 6 times and the guy and girl who have been working there most frequently have been super nice and friendly. :) Users/gurglemeow

20120503 14:36:58 nbsp Just stopped in to the best cupcake place in Davis and had to hurry home and write a review for them. I have to say, their customer service is top notch. That in itself will cause you to be a returning customer. The cupcakes here are soooo light and fluffy its like eating a cloud :) I tried their chocolate chip cookies and I swear they are AHMAZING! soft, yet not gooey and taste as if they just came out of the oven. I went today because it is a coworker of mines birthday and she loves their Mocha/Espresso cupcake, but unfortunately I had forgotten they have a daily menu and today is not the day for her cupcake. The guy at the counter said if I had a few minutes he would whip up a comparable one for her. NOW, THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE! She couldnt even tell the difference! I loved their cupcakes before, but after today and the wonderful experience I will certainly be a loyal customer :) Thank you to the wonderful staff for making my coworkers birthday that much more amazing. Users/hazeleyes16

20120614 13:31:49 nbsp This has become a regular stop for my fiance and I as part of our weekend outings. He loves the Dubliner and sticks with it (Ill admit, it is delicious), whereas Im still working my way through their other flavors. Thus far, Ive been pleased with every cupcake and the service has always been friendly, though they could stand to put a bell outside just in case the person working there is in the kitchen. At $2.75, I think theyre a reasonablypriced treat given the quality of the food. Users/AbbYu

20120929 19:11:36 nbsp Ive had cupcakes here for a while and liked them. My husband liked the frosting most of all he thought the cake was good (but not great.) I decided to go big for my friends birthday and instead of making a cake, or buying at Nugget which I usually do (if buying), I ordered chocolate espresso from Let Them Eat Cake. Unfortunately we were all disappointed because it was a very thick, dense cake, with just the smallest layer of frosting. I know people have different ideas of cake this review is simply to tell people that (1) if youre a small amount of frosting person then this is the place for you, but if (2) youre a lots of frosting person, then you may be quite disappointed.
It was very strange of 5 women there, not ONE finished their piece of chocolate cake. Ive never seen that before in my life... Im just glad I figured this out before I put in an order for our anniversary cake (our anniversary is next week), as my husband would have been annoyed, and I would have been supremely annoyed to spend twice the cost of a Nugget cake... As a side note, there were two glitches with the ordering process. First, I went in to order, and a guy working there asked me when I wanted it. When I told him it was for a Saturday (2 weeks away), so Id it pick it up on Friday, he told me this was impossible because the baker was making wedding cakes (or cake) that day and couldnt do more. Okaay. Fair enough. So I asked him if I could pick it up on Thursday, one day EARLIER. He told me NO, I couldnt order it for Thursday, if the cake was for Saturday. I was confused... Whaaat? He said something about health code problems, possibly, if I got a cake on Thursday night, for Saturday. This was weird I said Id put the cake in the fridge. He said NO. I said, so, youre not going to let me order a cake for Thursday OR Friday? He said NO. Luckily I remembered then that my friend switched the night to Friday (due to some childcare conflict) and WHEW! He allowed me to put in an order. Except he didnt want to take the order, he said to email them the order. 2nd slight weirdness was that I emailed the order and included a simple decoration message, and didnt get a confirmation for about 4 days. I wasnt sure they got my order because it took a while, but I figured they were obviously busy. I then replied to that message about doing some additional special birthday decoration, but this time I didnt hear back at all. And when I picked up the cake it was the first message. So, I would have preferred to do my order in person, so I could get acknowledgement in a timely manner, and have verbal discussion. I honestly wasnt 100% sure there would be a cake waiting for me when I went in, and prepared for a backup trip to Nugget...  Users/DeniseJF

20121018 21:07:04 nbsp I dont like eating cupcakes often because I think theyre too sweet (gasp!) but I tried their blueberry white chocolate scone and it is HEAVENLY. Seriously the best scone Ive ever had and cant wait to go get another one. Theyre really big and have a nice crisp on the top and corners, but its still soft inside. Tart and sweet and soooo good with tea. Im a fan! Users/ghwl

20121116 12:30:33 nbsp These are some of the best cupcakes Ive ever had. My personal favorites are the Brazilian Bombshell (Tuesdays; acai berry, tastes similar to blueberry, VERY yummy), Happy Days (I think? Rootbeer cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting; you can taste the effervescence!; Fridays), and the allmighty Pumpkin King cupcake (October seasonal flavor). Now let me tell you... my boyfriend isnt very fond of cupcakes (hes not a sweets guy) but he LOVES the Pumpkin King cupcakes. They are his favorite cupcakes EVER. Super moist because of the pumpkin, fluffy, not too sweet but just sweet enough. I could eat those all day. Breakfast, dessert, snack, whatever. When my boyfriend was still living in Davis and I first started going there, we were there about once a week or so to buy cupcakes, then we got too lazy because I moved to West Davis. I try to stop in when I can, and I go out of my way for sure for the aforementioned Pumpkin King cupcakes. (Seriously. If you havent tried them yet, you better go in next October.)

They also now accept credit cards! :D Makes me happy because I always am sad when I couldnt go because I didnt happen to have cash or my checkbook on hand.

I dont know about the bad service; every time Ive gone there its been good. Not like outoftheirwaytoberidiculouslycheery good, but definitely not rude by any means. Users/kimmisan

20121202 12:55:07 nbsp I have always enjoyed their cupcakes so I decided to order a birthday cake for my boyfriend. When the baker called me to go over my order my only request was for the cake to be super chocolatey and fudgy anything else was fair game since they were the pros. The cake turned out great! Super moist and my chocolate loving BF loved it. Users/JenniferH

20130104 18:17:57 nbsp cute place, cute story, probably the best cupcakes in town. Sometimes dry at the end of the day but when theyre good theyre delish. The Amy Winehouse, if/when you can get it, is amazing.  Users/PhoebeAyers

20130201 15:23:13 nbsp Ive been eager to taste their cupcakes for a while now.  I tried 2 different flavors and they were both delicious.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  Ill definitely come back. Users/Trena

20131022 16:38:04 nbsp Let Them Eat Cake  Central location, cute Frenchthemed interior, and most importantly delicious, moist cupcakes. Yes, at $2.75 per cupcake, they are a little pricy but well worth it. They carry Mighty Leaf tea and now that they have a running coffee machine, you can enjoy delicious cappuccinos and lattes. Regarding the customer service, I agree that it sometimes leaves to be desired. The daughters and the young man are helpful and quite welcoming, however the mother and the current female employee are not friendly. I have never had a smile or a greeting from the mother, even though I am a faithful customer. And the current female employee is barely polite. Even though this shop gets a lot of customers, Im wondering why the inside is pretty much always empty. They have wifi, are centrally located in a college town and yet customers seems to come in and out, not stay and hang out. Dommage! Users/SophiaBrattain

20131108 14:54:55 nbsp I love this place.  They have the BEST coffee in town.  I like the atmosphere, I have had interactions with all employees and they are all very nice. Quiet, considerate, and sincere is how I would describe their service which is exactly how I want it.  I get annoyed by overly perky and boisterous customer service, it just seems fake. Users/DagonJones

20140626 11:37:50 nbsp I hadnt been in to this place since they moved downtown, but I love the location! Super cute! The cupcakes are so good and you can definitely tell that they are homemade and preservative free. The frosting is outstanding. The creamerys cupcakes are massive and the frosting sometimes pastelike. The frosting at LTEC is light and fluffy and lovely! If the owners were interested, I think this could be a great daily breakfast/lunch place. The interiors are so cute and welcoming and there is so much seating! I would love to come in on an afternoon to enjoy a sandwich and iced tea with a mini cupcake for dessert. Just a suggestion!  Users/ArianeMetz
