The deans office for the College of Letters and Science is located in the Social Sciences and Humanities Building.  Frequently many freshmen and transfer students are unable to locate it, and many students end up in the office asking for directions elsewhere.  They allow walk in appointments which are few and generally unavailable, however, they cannot actually make normal appointments at the office thusly requiring one to access their http://appointments.ucdavis.edu/ online appointment system.

Letters and Science holds students to the 225 Unit Limit with few exceptions.

  Interesting Fact: Letters and Sciences first reached equal undergraduate enrollment to that of College of Agriculture Agriculture in 1960.
