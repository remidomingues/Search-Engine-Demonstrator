Hi there, and Welcome to the Wiki.  Check out How to edit this page to learn a bit more about how to edit this wiki, youre getting the hang of it! I shrunk the picture on your page by turning it into a thumbnail, which you can read on how to edit that page.  You can also always click the Info button on the top of the page and use the compare feature to see http://daviswiki.org/Solano_Paw_Prints?actiondiff&version213&version112 what was done in any edit.  Good luck. Users/edwins ES
