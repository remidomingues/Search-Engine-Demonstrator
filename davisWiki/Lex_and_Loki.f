Lex Luthor and Loki share an apartment with Users/AnnaJones Anna Jones and Users/AnthonyValenzuela Anthony Valenzuela.Image(lex.jpg, Lex, looking all cute, right, thumbnail)
Their favorite things to do, in order of preference are:

  Eat
  Sit at an open window
  Take catnaps
  Play with small pieces of plastic or hair ties
  Cuddle with their humans
  Chase each other
  Cuddle with and clean each other

They hide when someone knocks on the front door, or when Anthony pulls the vacuum cleaner out. Loki prefers to sit in Annas lap, or on the desk in front of her while shes studying or sitting at the computer. He also likes to cuddle against Annas tummy under the covers at night, or against Anna or Anthonys tummy if one of them is lying on the couch. Lex gets excited at night when someone heads in the direction of the bed. He races ahead of them and leaps onto the bed to commence with the nightly ritual of attackthehandsundertheblankets, followed by a scratch behind the ears and under the chin.

Lex and Loki were litter mates, born to a feral mother and presumably feral father(s). They were rescued at approximately 8 weeks of age by Annas sister, Amy, who raised them and turned them into the sweet kitties they are today. Loki and Lex are codependent, and freak out when one cant find the other one. They are frequently seen sleeping together, and cleaning each other.
They have several nicknames that are used for either, or both:

  Little Bastard
  Fluffy Butt
  Fatty McFatterson
  Smelly Cat
  Baby
  Chubby Boy
  Whiny
  Monkey
  Stinky McSmelly

Lex is also sometimes called Lexipoo.
