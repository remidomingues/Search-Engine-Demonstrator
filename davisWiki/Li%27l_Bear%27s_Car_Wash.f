Lil Bears Car Wash is a coinop... AKA selfserve Car Wash car wash. It has 5 wash bays and 6 vacuum machines.  If you want a full service wash, there is a team of cute fuzzy little bears who will wash your car for you.  Some people have questioned the ethics of enslaving young bears into forced labor, but you cant argue with the results! The car wash features standard wash options such as high pressure soap, wax, rinse, and low pressure foam brush, tire/engine cleaner, presoak, and spotfree rinse. The canopy over the vacuum area provides good relief from the sun/rain. Conveniently located on site are vending machines that sell car care products, as well as snacks and cold soda for your enjoyment while you pamper your car. The change machine is only given out tokens, but wash, vacuum, and vending machines are programmed to accept tokens, U.S quarters, Susan Anthony B.,  Sacagawea, and new presidential dollar coins.

20090912 14:29:19 nbsp I went here and was kind of annoyed that I could only put two tokens in at a time, and to buy more time I could only use quarters before the time ran out. I found myself scrambling to find quarters (because I couldnt use the token I had on hand) and therefore wasted my paid time.

Oh, and one other thing: The stall that I used was covered in grease, and I kept slipping as I was washing my car. Ive been to similar car washes and yeah, sometimes those are slippery too. However what I didnt realize was that the grease saturated my shoes, and so after I drove home I noticed there was grease all over the inside of my drivers seat floor. I ended up having to buy carpet cleaner for that, too. I guess that might be normal to some car washes and I should have paid better attention, Im just pointing it out because Ive never had this happen before at any other selfserve car washes.

The car was itself was OK. Just be sure to have quarters on hand as well as tokens because 4 minutes just wasnt enough time for me to wash my pontiac. Users/BrookeB
