20100904 11:44:04 nbsp Welcome to the wiki.  You may also wish to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  When a stylist leaves a salon, it is common for the wiki to document what salon they went to.  But advertising on a (what is now) your competitors page, http://daviswiki.org/Luci%27s_Salon?actiondiff&version2226&version1224 listing prices and encouraging people to come over, goes too far and is not a very nice thing to do, in my opinion.  Also, wiki is a nonprofit and is meant to be informational, not advertising.   Another editor (not me) deleted your comment from the Lucis salon page, and I added a simple note saying which salon you have gone to.  Users/CovertProfessor
