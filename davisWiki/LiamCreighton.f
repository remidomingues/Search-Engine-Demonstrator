Sex Appeal: Id do me

At various points in my life Ive been described as a deadbeat, dead inside, English, and somewhat disappointingly, a nice guy. Ill leave it up to you to decide for yourselves.

I come from a country where the national religion is football (the roundball kind) and the national sport is drinking. Im a little bit afraid of American churches. Theyre generally not very old, and theyre full of worshippers, not tourists.

Ive been resident in Davis for a couple of years, but I didnt chose to be here. I chose to be with a girl who chose UC Davis for her PhD. So it goes. Now Im here Im quite fond of Northern California. I like the fact that almost everyone is originally from somewhere else; its easier to fit in.

Anyone who spends more than a couple of minutes talking to me will very quickly discover that Im into movies. When its my turn to do postgraduate study Im taking my girl back to the UK where I will (hopefully) attend film school. Im really quite singleminded about this. I discovered that one of my favourite filmmakers, Krystof Kieslowski (the director of the Three Colours trilogy) was rejected twice from film school in Poland before he got in, which Im sure will be reassuring at some point in the future.

In the meantime Im trying to keep my days as filmic as possible. I shoot and edit occasional projects for clients, and use the proceeds to add to my personal collection of film equipment. Get in touch if youd like me to shoot something, unless its a wedding. I dont do weddings, not even for special friends. Some people on this wiki may have seen the documentary I produced for the opening night of the Varsity Theatre. Im quite cheap, although Im starting to think I might be worth a little bit more.

I just started working as a media trainer at Davis Media Access (formerly Davis Community Television), so if youre keen to learn how to shoot with a Canon XL2 or GL2, or want to learn how to use Final Cut, sign yourself up for a class and find out for yourself if Im really dead inside.


Hey, do you know if the ice cream/cafe by Varsity will be a new Mishkas? Users/PhilipNeustrom

Philip, the ice cream cafe will be called Icekrimski Cafe. It will not be a new Mishkas. Sinisa Novakovic is currently in negotiations with the City council regarding putting a brand new building on the land between the Varsity and the Hunt Boyer Mansion. If he is successful this is where Mishkas will move to. Users/LiamCreighton Liam Creighton
