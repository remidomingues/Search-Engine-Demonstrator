{{{Libel
n.
   1.
       a. A false publication, as in writing, print, signs,
          or pictures, that damages a persons reputation.
       b. The act of presenting such material to the public.}}}

Basically, libel is saying something false and damaging about someone in print. Dont do this, it is illegal and you can be sued. Libel is not to be confused with Slander.

Libel consists of three parts. First, the writer must publish an untruth about another person in a manner that is meant to be believed by others. Second, the object of the authors words must be damaged in some fashion. Third, to distinguish libel from slander, the publication must be in some form of permanent impression. That medium may be anything from a ponderous tome to a photograph either in a book or embedded in a website to an email. Even an angry response posted to a chat room may be the subject of a lawsuit. However, since the wiki can be changed and altered almost instantly the permanency of a statement is questionable.

Furthermore, the most important component of libel is that the published material is untrue or misleading in a manner that defames the subject. If the words are facts, they cannot be libelous. Misinformation that is essentially harmless is also not considered to be defamatory and therefore libelous.

Problems arise when the published material is misleading or incorrect and when it also defames the subject. Then three issues come into play. First, was the subject a private or a public figure? Second, did the author show a reckless disregard for the truth? And third, did the author maliciously intend to do harm to the subject (only if the subject is a public figuresee the movie The People vs Larry Flynt) or was reasonable care taken (if the subject is a private party).

Note that libelous is NOT synonymous with negative or biased.  Libel is not permitted here; bias and negativity are. However, pages that present only one side Neutral Point of View can be balanced with other views if you have an opposing viewpoint; and negative information may not always be incorrect or even inappropriate.

Many insults are not considered libelous.  For detail, see http://www.internetcases.com/archives/2005/03/thanks_to_denis.html  California Court of Appeal: Dumb Ass is not a defamatory term.

 Libel on the Wiki 
Please dont threaten the Wiki with libel lawsuits if another editor posts information you think is libelous.  Its silly, its obnoxious, and its not going to help you get what you want.  Most people dont like being threatened.  The wiki, like all interactive computer service providers, receives wide protection from the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act Communications Decency Act.  Your beef is with the person who wrote the potentially libelous statement.

That said, libel is not welcome here.  The Wiki isnt set up to be some kind of arbiter of the truth; all of the editors here do their best to make sure obviously bogus claims dont stay.  If you believe content is libelous, you should raise the issue.  People will try to come up with a reasonable resolution, but you need to remember that people who arent personally involved are often left trying to guess about a hesaidshesaid situation.  If the discussion doesnt turn out the way you want it to, you may need to take the issue up off the wiki.  If you feel its necessary, the Legal Services page can help you find local legal advice and/or representation.

Its also a bad idea to threaten fellow editors with libel lawsuits to shut them up.  California has a broad antiSLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, viewable http://www.casp.net/statutes/cal425.html here.  If you file a libel lawsuit against someone without enough information to show a probability that you will prevail, and the alleged libel is speech in a public forum (like the Wiki!) about a matter of public interest, the judge can throw out your case and require you to pay the defendants legal costs.  That aint cheap.  If youre only threatening, just bear in mind that if youre reading this, the person youre threatening probably is, too.  If they really are speaking falsehoods, youre probably better off taking formal steps to let them know youre serious.  If youre just trying to intimidate them, you should stop, because they probably know it as well as you.

In short, if you actually believe youre being defamed and the community doesnt have enough information to agree the offending statement needs to be taken down, you need to address it through the proper channels.  Dont be a jerk and throw around legal threats on here.
