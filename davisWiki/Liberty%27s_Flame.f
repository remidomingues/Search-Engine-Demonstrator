Libertys Flame is a conservative (not necessarily Republican) paper put on by the Young Conservatives Foundation (YCF), a nonprofit registered corporation that exists solely for the purpose of putting out the paper.   YCF gets its funding from grants from other conservative organizations and advertising space.  Unlike the liberal papers on campus, students do not subsidize its production.

Most (or possibly all) members of the YCF board are or have recently been members of the Davis College Republicans

AS PAPERs cannot produce the quality of printing they would like, and they have the resources to produce it without AS PAPERs, so it is printed elsewhere, possibly by a company in Sacramento.  They did print one issue a couple years back through AS PAPERs, which was pretty hilarious because Jon Otero wrote about how they were abandoning their principles by getting public funding.


 Speculation 
A publication unleashed by the Davis College Republicans.

I am pretty sure this is a libertarian publication and not republican? Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Oh come off of the high horse.  The Davis Libertarians like the death penalty and hate abortion.  How the hell is that libertarian?  It isnt.  Its republicans that think the word republican is bad so they attach to the term libertarian cause I dont know  they like guns.  I really dont know.  There was a prochoice rally and some guy got arrested there a few years back for protesting against it.  He claimed to be a Libertarian.  Some people dont see this as incongruent.  But if you start wanting to limit personal freedom and support economic freedom then you are, by the Libertarian Partys definition, a republican  so yeah, get with it. Users/ChristopherMckenzie
    Keep in mind that there are several major flavors of Libertarian political philosophy, one major branch of which is highly anticorporation and anticapitalism.  Libertarians believe in full rights to the individual which are given away by compact, some by social agreement (government) and others by individual consent.  There are quite a few systems that fit into that, from cooperative communism to democratic socialism to capitalism (the anticorporate philosophy holds that only very small groups can form equal relationships and agreements).  Two forms of government which do not fit in are authoritarian fascism or socialism, which may be way people are turning to the label Libertarian, since those tend to be in vogue at the national level right now from our two representative parties.  There are plenty of prolife Libertarians... if you accept that life begins at conception, you have to see abortion as the ultimate removal of liberty by force  murder.  It all boils down to when you see life as beginning.  I dont see a clump of cells as having rights until a bit later, but there is zero incongruency in a prolife Libertarian.  Like most arguments on the issue, it hinges on when the biological act turns into a human with rights.  Users/JabberWokky jw
     Soooo ... some of these branches are indistinguishable from some branches of the Republican Party except by name alone.  I have met a lot of true Libertarians who I could not call Republicans.  One guy I know, for instance, after being robbed, went to a private detective because he didnt believe in using the governments established police force for assistance.  Some of the supposed Davis Libertarians are pro drug control and anti gay marriage.  Im not saying that there arent Libertarians out there, but a lot of the supposed ones I meet are just confused Republicans who found a new SAT word to use. Users/ChristopherMckenzie
        Certainly.  But that has nothing to do with Libertys Flame being Libertarian or not.  Does it claim to be?  It was created by the DCR and claims to be conservative, which doesnt seem to indicate they are selfidentifying as Libertarian.  Phillip said that they might, but phrased it as a question.  I have met plenty of people who seemed to not understand their claimed political affiliation, but that has little to do with this particular publication.  Incidently, the large paeloconservative branch of Republicans can very arguably be considered Libertarian (and tends to support the ideals of JFK and reject much of Bushs actions), so there are overlapping groups.  Id imagine, like most college publications, the leanings of the publication depends upon who happens to be writing and editing the publication at any given year.   Users/JabberWokky jw

Libertys Flame is an ASPAPERS publication created by the DCR. Users/DanMasiel

Definitely DCR.  I have a copy of one of the best issues, if youre interested.  Users/BrentLaabs

Actually its not put out by DCR, YCF and DCR are two different groups on campus...true there is a bit of overlap in the membership but they are in fact different entities.
