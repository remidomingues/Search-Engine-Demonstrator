 Liddy Gee y Iggy Pee 

An eccentric indie band from Foster City, California. Known for their complex Foster City vernacular and understated good looks, Liddy Gee y Iggy Pee often leave their listeners soaked in a postcoital wake of Budweiser and circular logic. They currently play as a guitar duo, although rumors are abound that they may be adding a drummer for future shows. Their music has been described as the combined sound of a rambunctious, rebellious youth and a fierce dedication to the humor of inside jokes, obscure lyrics, and quirky guitar spasms.

 Members 

Lindsey Giusto, lead singer and lyricist, has been known to utilize a twosided psychological mask during live shows, often juxtaposing harsh screams and seductive coos to emphasis the loud/soft dynamic of Liddy Gee y Iggy Pees music.

Ignat Printsev, a philosophy and biology student of UC Davis, takes the role of graphic designer in the band, arranging, adding to, and filling out Lindseys structural ingenuity with found items: chains, empty wine bottles, boxes, screams, and exasperated sighs of triumph.

Both members hail from Foster City, California.

 Influences 
According to the band (in what appears to be story form):
Leo CoHEN & Gene Gunit Wilder muttered Liddy, in between drags off his large, often phallic, Cubano  elegantly wrapped in the film of his saliva. Oi, Oi! exclaimed Iggy with his arms in the air, a toothbrush in one hand, and a pitch fork in another, HUNTING BEARS! IS PERHAPS ONE OF MY FONDEST HOBBIES!!!! Suddenly, Liddys aura turned into a deep, dark shade of honey mustard. THATS IT MAN! Calvin and Hobbes! And so they quivered giggled, and they drank spritzer until noon.


 Controversy 
Much has been made about the strange Spanish y that combines the nicknamed parts of Liddy Gee & Iggy Pee. Little has been said by the band about the language barrier introduced by the y (pronounced e) but theories are abound that the y emphasizes the bands universal appeal and simultaneously exemplifies the bands preference for peculiar lyrics, singing styles, and guitar techniques.
