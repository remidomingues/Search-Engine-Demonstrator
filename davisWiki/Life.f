Describe life here.

Where to begin??

is a series of dogs. George Carlinoon

I was walking my dog at Christmas time in the cloudy afternoon of Christmas Eve in the Village Homes Shire, when I caught a whiff of wood smoke from a fireplace.  That was life.

When I was a little boy, my mother used to sing me a song. It went like this: Life is short, life is shit, and soon it will be over. Cabbie from Brain Candy

Life is like a box of chocolates. A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift that nobody ever asks for. Unreturnable  because all you get back is another box of chocolates. Youre stuck with this undefinable whippedmint crap that you mindlessly wolf down when theres nothing else left to eat. Sure, once in a while, theres a peanut butter cup. An English toffee. But theyre gone too fast, the taste is fleeting. So you end up with nothing but broken bits, filled with hardened jelly and teethshattering nuts. If youre desperate enough to eat those, all youve got left... is an empty box... filled with useless, brown paper wrappers.  The XFiles

  While UCD students can formally study life at the School of Medicine or a biology or philosophy course, you might also consider navigating davis getting out into the world, and adventures outside of davis exploring it, maybe love meeting some people and experiencing life first handcows .
