LIGHT OPERA THEATRE OF SACRAMENTO (LOTS)
The Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento (LOTS) was founded in 1982 by Mike and Debbie Baad and Dolores Allen. Drawing on their considerable theatre experience, including roles with the Sacramento Opera and Davis Comic Opera, the Baad family assembled a core group of St. Marys Church Choir members to start the St. Marys Players. H.M.S. Pinafore, the St. Marys Players first production in 1982, received rave reviews. H.M.S. Pinafore was followed in 1983 by The Pirates of Penzance and in 1984 by The Mikado. By this time, the St. Marys Players, drawing on many talented performers from throughout the Sacramento area, had established itself with the theatregoing public, and its productions were attracting larger and larger audiences. In its fourth year, the St. Marys Players became The Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento and moved to a new home at the Coloma Community Center. In 1989 they moved to their present location at the 24th Street Theater.

In addition, LOTS has performed at the Woodland Opera House, Theater El Dorado in Placerville, at the Vets Memorial Theatre in Davis, and in Roseville. In previous years, LOTS has also presented works other than the Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire, including Man of La Mancha, and Stephen Sondheims Side by Side. LOTS is a member of the Sacramento Area Regional Theater Alliance (SARTA) and a founding member of the League of Sacramento Theatres. Mike and Debbie Baad continue to guide the development of LOTS as artistic directors of the organization.

2012 Production:
THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE

Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento celebrates its 31st season with Gilbert & Sullivan’s swashbuckling musical comedy The Pirates of Penzance. Goofy, irreverent, and as entertaining today as it was when it first opened in 1879, Gilbert and Sullivans The Pirates of Penzance follows the story of an orphan boy who was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate instead of a (ships) pilot. One of the most popular operettas ever written, Pirates is a hilarious farce featuring softhearted pirates, bumbling policemen, impressionable young ladies, an eccentric MajorGeneral, and is pouring over with unforgettable melodies such as Poor Wandering One, and tonguetwisting songs such as I am the Very Model of a Modern MajorGeneral. The company performs with a live orchestra and supertitles.

Synopsis: When Frederic (Ian Cullity) was a child, Ruth (Debbie Baad), his nurse, was instructed to apprentice him to be a ships pilot. Being hard of hearing she misunderstood and instead apprenticed him to be a pirate, taking a job as the pirates’ maidofallwork in order to be by his side. Having finally reached the age of twentyone, and having dutifully served his piratical apprenticeship, Frederic is preparing to return to civilization. With just half an hour left to serve, Frederic warns the Pirate King (Chris Baad) that he plans to renounce piracy and, since it is a dishonest business, will now devote himself to drive it out of existence. Frederic urges the piratesMajorGeneral to join him in embracing a lawful calling, but they refuse.

Ruth pleads with Frederic to marry her and take her with him. Frederic has never seen another woman and has no way of knowing whether Ruth is as beautiful as she tells him. Nor is he sure how he feels about taking a fortyseven year old wife. Just then a group of young girls, the daughters of MajorGeneral Stanley (Mike Baad), appear. Frederic immediately sees they are beautiful—in contrast to Ruth’s plainness—and renounces her. Frederic attempts to attract the attention of the girls, but only Mabel (Sara Haugland) takes an interest. As Frederic woos her, the pirates return and seize the girls, determined to marry them on the spot. The MajorGeneral opportunely arrives and dissuades the pirates from their dastardly plan. He has heard that they show sympathy towards orphans and tells them that he is one. Sure enough, they agree to free his daughters.

The MajorGeneral has taken to spending sleepless nights full of guilt on account of his lie to the pirates. He is consoled only by his childrens sympathy and Frederic’s plan of leading a band of police against the pirates. The police arrive and are enthusiastically sent off by the MajorGeneral and the girls, leaving Frederic alone. The Pirate King and Ruth return and confront Frederic with some news of their own. They remind Frederic of an amusing paradox: his apprenticeship was to run out on his twentyfirst birthday, and since he was born on February 29th—leap day—he has only now reached his fifth birthday! Obeying the dictates of his strong sense of duty, Frederic immediately rejoins the pirates. He tells them that the MajorGeneral is not really an orphan and they declare revenge. Awaiting the perfect opportunity, they sneak up on the MajorGeneral and capture him. Just in the nick of time, the police come to the rescue and charge the pirates to yield, which they do. Ruth explains that pirates are really “all noblemen who have gone wrong” and they are pardoned and allowed to marry the girls.
