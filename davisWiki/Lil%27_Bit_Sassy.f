20090618 13:45:25 nbsp I have been seeing Leisha for the past few years for cuts and highlights and she is just awesome! She knows what works and what doesnt work for my face and skin tone and I have never left the salon feeling unsatisfied! I think it is a bit more expensive than some other places in town, but it is well worth it, in my opinion, and you really get what you pay for! Users/JessicaNoel

20120530 08:22:01 nbsp Worth the drive from Roseville!!!  After going to all the big wig salons here is Roseville and fair oaks I realize I was paying WAY to much when I never fully got what I really wanted.... En even hair cut!! Also I tint my hair red and it always looked dull.  Nancy puts a shine in it that I really like.  My hair is very thin.  If I get a bad cut it takes forever to grow back. So I cannot afford to sit in a chair and stress out any more.  Just the fact that when I sit in Nancys chair I can relax and not stress out on what hair I may end up with, is worth the drive to me!! Thanks Nancy.   Users/SusanBerger

20130120 08:08:49 nbsp I bring my mother here.  She has lovely thick hair that can be a real challenge to cut, but Lil Bit Sassy has done an excellent job every time.  We love this place! Users/joannahale
