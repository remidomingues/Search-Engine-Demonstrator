Once Pole Line Road crosses Cowell Blvd. Cowell Boulevard it becomes Lillard Drive. It crosses Drummond Avenue and passes Putah Creek Park before coming to an end.
That Lillard Drive and Drummond Avenue connect should be noted that historically Jennie D. Drummond, prominent woman of Davisville,  married Henry R. Lillard.
