Lilys Day Care is a familyrun, statelicensed childcare service.  Lilys Day Care has years of experience in natural parenting, and is familiar with cloth diapering and breastmilk. Lilys provides kindergarten preparation for preschoolers and a variety of activities for children, from infants up through school age children.  With a focus on diversity and exposure to other cultures, Lilys offers a nurturing environment for the children of our community.

Philosophy
Lilys Day Care uses the innovative teaching techniques of the Montessori school system and the Reggio Emilia Approach.  Unlike traditional teaching methods, where each subject is rigidly separated and students conform to the lesson plan of the teacher, these methods focus attention where it belongs – on the student.  The teaching style at Lilys is a blend of social development, imagination, and creativity  your childs interests direct the teaching, and one subject leads easily into another.  A child might experience the beauty of nature, learn the names of plants and animals, be introduced to the circle of life, and get healthy exercise, all while playing in the expansive backyard available at Lilys.  In summertime, kids learn first hand the science and fun of vegetable gardening. Art, English, science, and P.E. all follow naturally from the experience, rather than learning being dictated by and limited to a single subject alone.

Cultural Awareness
Lilys Day Care understands the importance of introducing children to other cultures, and makes diversity the goal whenever possible.  The children are given a wide variety of music to listen to on a daily basis, from classics such as Mozart and Bach to African and Spanish songs.  The children learn to appreciate the different styles of the world while developing an appreciation for music of all types.  In addition, Lilys Day Care can offer your child exposure to Spanish, as the owner is a fluent Spanish and English speaker.  It is welldocumented that exposure to two or more languages is extremely beneficial to a child – Lilys is able to give your child that extra benefit.

Activities
Children at Lilys Day Care have a wide range of opportunities for play and learning.  There is a regular storytime, as well as a constant supply of music from all over the world.  Younger children have ample exposure to language, both English and Spanish, and the backyard, with playset and beautiful landscaping, is available for all.  Care is available both before and after school, and school pickup and dropoff can be arranged.


20100128 07:57:45 nbsp I was quite apprehensive about going back to work when my son was only 4 months old, but having him in Lily’s care has completely alleviated my worry.  Lily provides a warm, caring environment, as well as being immaculately clean, and my son is now 16 months and thriving.  It was a blessing to find Lily! Users/KristinS

20131107 22:30:40 nbsp My daughter began attending daycare with Lily two afternoons a week when she was 18 months old.  She quickly felt comfortable and talked excitedly about her experiences after each session.  Lily is warm, caring and very obviously emotionally invests in the life of each child in her care.  My daughter was exposed to Spanish and English at daycare and has begun naming objects in Spanish and following directions in Spanish quite well which has been a wonderful added bonus.  The environment has always appeared very clean and is conducive to handson play and learning.  We are moving out of state or I certainly would have looked forward to my daughters continued participation in Lilys daycare setting.  Users/KatieColvin

20131123 19:31:02 nbsp I have had Lily watch my kids from infancy until grade school. She is extremely conscientious and maintains a super clean home. I was really happy with the bilingual environment. Also, Lily makes an effort to entertain children with toys and books as opposed to some day care providers who put children in front of the TV.  I would recommend her care without reservation.  Users/Sarakurzenhauser

20131125 12:43:14 nbsp Lily has been taking care of our daughter since we started her in day care when she was 6 months old, and we could not be more thrilled. As her program description and other reviewers have noted, she has many wonderful and engaging activities for the children, provides a bilingual environment, her home is lovely and clean, and the children are always beaming when we pick up or drop off. But more than that, Lily and her family have provided a loving, nurturing home for the children, and we consider them an extension of our family. I have never felt a moments worry about leaving our daughter with Lily and would recommend her without hesitation.   Users/AnnWillis

20140606 12:43:35 nbsp I wholeheartedly recommend Lilys Daycare for all of the same reasons as the other comments. My daughter LOVES Lily and going to her daycare. She has a wonderful time with the other children. At 15 months, she often doesnt want to leave when I come to pick her up!  Users/MonicaKeane
