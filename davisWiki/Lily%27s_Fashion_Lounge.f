Lily’s Fashion Lounge was one of the very first original women’s clothing boutique to open in Downtown Davis (established in 1997). What made Lilys unique is that, in addition to the fun, fashionable and VERY affordable clothing, they offered a unique shopping environment and a fun helpful staff that would assist with any of your fashion needs.  The store closed in 2007.

Their setting included wall hangings of vintage clothing, local artwork, oneofakind wrought iron detailing, and the Lilys Lounge. The lounge was a comfortable sitting area filled with dozens of the latest fashion and mens magazines. So when you had finished selecting from their latest fashions or if you needed some ideas to get started, the lounge was the place to be! Also, if you needed to occupy the man in your life while you shop, the lounge had mens magazine selections specifically for him to enjoy.

The People
All of their employees were UC Davis students and many were fashion design majors, studying the latest colors, fabrics, and fashions. Everyone on staff had an excellent knowledge of fashion and they was proficient in helping customers match a difficult item, find that perfect accessories to complete their look, or find an outfit for a special occasion. However, they would also simply leave customers to browse at their leisure.


20070530 01:28:13 nbsp I came here looking for a lastminute dress to wear to a wedding, and the owner suggested a dress to me that I never would have picked out for myself but ended up loving and buying that same day. Dresses are, in fact, pretty affordable, and they offer a 5% discount to UCD and DHS students (maybe even any student?). For nonslutty fancy clothes, I recommend this place.  Users/ElisaHough
