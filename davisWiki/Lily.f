The part I like best about cats is their independence if you leave home for a few days, they can kill a bird to eat, and they arent as emotionally needy as dogs (nor do they slobber!) Having grown up being tortured by Stephanies youngest sister, Lily is extremely tolerant of people and their antics. Shes been dressed up, put in boxes, and had her fur pulled constantly. All in all, shes a very awesome friend :)
