Lily is a mini Aussie who was once described as objectively adorable by a https://twitter.com/cory_golden/status/373134934233186304 Davis Enterprise reporter and has been likened to both a bear cub and a baby deer. She makes noises like a little dragon when shes excited, which is pretty much all the time. She can often be found exploring Downtown with her humans and hanging out at the dog parks.

Lily was stolen out of her home on the evening of August 26th, 2013, but thanks to an amazing response by community members, especially those in the Davis Pets Lost and Found group on Facebook, she was recovered by Yolo County Animal Services and returned to her family on August 29th! Shes no worse for her little adventure, and is back to playing fetch for hours on end and taking up as much of the bed as possible.
