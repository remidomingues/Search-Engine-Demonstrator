20070718 03:24:02 nbsp I think I found the same dog about a month ago. She was wandering around Arlington Farm Apts, a very wellbehaved and nice dog. We walked her around the neighborhood and found a house she seemed to know, the one on next to Arlington Farms that looks almost like a boat, but they didnt answer the door, so we left them a note and took the dog to the shelter in Woodland. We called the next day and they had picked her up. Her name is Cocoa.
