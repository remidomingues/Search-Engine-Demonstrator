The Lincoln Highway originated when Carl Fisher (who built the Indianapolis Motor Speedway), saw a need for a transcontinental highway. The early supporters of the highway decided to name the new route for Abraham Lincoln, who fifty years earlier had supported the construction of the first railroads transcontinental railroad. Beginning in 1913, the highway, with its termini at wiki:newyorkcity:Times Square in wiki:newyorkcity New York City to wiki:sf:Lincoln Park in wiki:sf San Francisco, saw dozens of communities battle over the routing of this first national road. Within the following decade, other highways were designated, and new routes were devised by local, regional, and state supporters vying for federal, state, and tourist dollars. This echoed the earlier battles over railheads and depot choices during the development of the railroads.

The Lincoln Highway wound directly through Davis at one point, approaching from the east along what is now I 80, passing down Olive Drive, and under the Richards overpass. The road then turned left onto First, right on B Street, and then heading west toward Winters via what is now Russell, passing the original entrance to Campus UC Davis.

There used to be gas stations in this part of Davis because of the Lincoln Highway. The route within the town limits had gas stations, restaurants (the SnoWhite drivein, which became JuJus, which then became Murder Burger which was renamed Redrum Burger), and lodging (an auto court, now Slatters Court). There were three gas stations within town along the route. Two of them were on opposing sides of B Street at the intersection of B and First one of which was owned and operated by Joe Truffini, while the third was on the southwest corner of Fifth and B, as the highway turned west out into the countryside.

Slatters Court (pronounced Slaters) on Olive Drive was one of many motor courts that peppered the highway. Back then, one could drive their automobile into the Court, get a cabin (now homes), clean up at the community bathroom (today a rental residence), eat at the community cafeteria (currently a multiroomed dwelling called IHouse), and in the morning fuel up at the station (presently a barber shop).

With the advent of other highways such as Highway 50, support for the Lincoln Highway dwindled. Eventually, the road was realigned in spots and rechristened Highway 40 Route 40. At this time, the citys portion ceased to function, and a new section was built just outside the city limits. Route 40 was later redesignated Interstate 80 I80. The eastern end of Olive Drive curves slightly and serves as an freeway exit. Beyond that, the original, extant Lincoln Highway is now a Bike Paths bike path extending to the Yolo Causeway causeway.


 Historic Markers 

Fact Check: In 1928, the Boy Scouts erected 3,000 concrete monuments along the length, the local one of which is located in Central Park at the corner of B and Russell.  this is the official recorded history, but the plaque appears to contradict this.  Possible BSA and the Building Inspection Division together?  Somebody could contact the local Boy Scouts and see if they have any records.

Another marker is located at Russell and Arthur in West Davis.

  I believe the concrete marker was originally erected by the Boy Scouts, with no involvement from the Building Inspection Division; eventually, many of these markers were taken down across the nation. At some point, two of the markers were either saved or found, and the marker was then reinstalled by the Chamber of Commerce and the Building Inspection Division with the accompanying plaque. This side of the street didnt become Central Park until the 1930s. John Lofland, Phyllis Haig, or someone similar is probably more knowledgeable than me on this subject.  Users/CentralDavisite
