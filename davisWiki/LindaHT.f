Describe Users/LindaHT here.
I am a fun loving girl who loves this little town!  I just turned 22 and have a bunny and a bird in my home on 2nd Street.  I love Thrift Stores thrift store visits, thai food, and plays, especially musicals.  I am super single and mingling with the ladies only (yes I am a lesbian).  Anywho, if you want to get to know me or follow my commentary please do so, be well folks!
