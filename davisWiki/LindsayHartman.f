20080227 16:30:12 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. After reading your http://daviswiki.org/Chiles_Mansion?actiondiff&version226&version125 comment on the Chiles Mansion page Id like to invite you to add more information about the Native Peoples who were here before. Remember that the Wiki is only as good as you make it. Oh, and generally comments left in the comment section should have attribution for who left them to make it easier to track the history of the conversation; to do this you can use the third button from the right on the edit page (the one that looks like a name tag).
