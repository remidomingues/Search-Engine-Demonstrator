I was a grad student in the UC Davis School of Educations teaching credential and Masters in Education program from 2006 to 2008.  I spent my undergraduate years at UC Davis (20022006), majoring in English and Women and Gender Studies.   I moved to Portland, Oregon with Users/JonathonLeathers Jonathon Leathers in 2007 and teach middle school Language Arts in a small town on the outskirts of the city.  I really wish wiki:Portland had a wiki.

Below is a picture of me from The March for Womens Lives which I attended in April 2004 with our campus NOW group. The green party on campus donated mucho dinero, so I made a sign for them.
