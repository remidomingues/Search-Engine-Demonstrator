Linguistics is a department in the Letters and Science College of Letters and Science.  The department used to be housed in the 2nd floor of Sproul Hall, and due to a shortage of office space several faculty members had their offices offcampus in a suite at the corner of B St. and 2nd (200 B St., Suite A).   Eventually, they moved to Kerr Hall Kerr, where the department is currently housed, with the majority of offices on the 2nd floor.  For detailed course and faculty info not found below please see the http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu department web site. Also, note that the major requirements have changed starting Fall 2007.

UC Davis now has a Linguistics Club.

 Courses 

 Lower Division 
LIN 1: Intro to Linguistics  An introductory course for majors and nonmajors alike, this introduces all the areas of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. It also may include a discussion of language features and language acquisition, and sections on the evolution and genealogy of languages or sociolinguistics.

LIN 20, 21, 22, 23: 20  Oral English, 2123: Reading and Writing for NonNative Speakers



 Upper Division 
If you are planning on majoring or minoring in Linguistics (except Linguistics for Language Teachers minor) you will need to take these two classes:
 LIN 103A: Linguistic Analysis I: Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology

 LIN 103B: Linguistic Analysis II: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics

Most, but not all of the courses below require LIN 1 and 103A/B:
 LIN 105: Topics in Language and Linguistics

 LIN 106: English Grammar (same as ENL 106)

 LIN 111: Intro to Phonological Theory aka Optimality Theory 101

 LIN 112: Phonetics

 LIN 121: Morphology

 LIN 131: Intro to Syntactic Theory

 LIN 141: Semantics (philosophy people should find this one very interesting)

 LIN 150: Languages of the World (as its basically a more general version of LIN 152, I wouldnt recommend taking both)

 LIN 151: Historical Linguistics

 LIN 152: Language Universals and Typology

 LIN 160: American Voices

 LIN 163: Language, Gender, and Society

 LIN 165: Applied Linguistics

 LIN 171: Introduction to Psycholinguistics

 LIN 173: Language Development (same as EDU 173)

 LIN 175: Biological Basis of Language

 LIN 177: Computational Linguistics  A class about working with human language on computers. Prof. Ojeda teaches this class. He covers sound, meaning, morphology, and syntax, mostly focusing on using computers to express the linguistic concepts. I havent once heard him discuss any particular applications of Computational Linguistics, but youre free to imagine  the goal is to teach the concepts that are encountered in Linguistics, and to teach ways to work with them in wiki:WikiPedia:Prolog Prolog.

 LIN 182: Multilingualism

Theres also graduate and Ph.D. programs.

Some faculty members
  Will Benware. (Emeritus)  Grandfatherly figure and one of the clearest speakers you may ever have the pleasure of hearing.  Comes to class every day in a threepiece suit, and for a lack of a more eloquent (and accurate) way to put it, he knows his sht. Usually teaches 103A, 151, and 50.
  Patrick Farrell.  A little bit twitchy.  Has been heard to use the word shit in class without it being part of data for analysis.  He is very receptive to students dropping by to discuss or argue about linguistic things.  Used to be the department undergraduate advisor and was honestly not an extremely helpful one.  Usually teaches 103B and 152.
  Raul Aranovich. His confusing name results from a Russian ethnic background but Argentinian nationality.  Usually teaches 103B, 121, and 131. Current undergraduate advisor.
  Jason Schneider. Young, possibly attractive, professor who teaches course 1. Very helpful and will make you want to switch majors.
  Almerindo Ojeda. Very intensely involved with Comp Lin. Teaches 141 and 177.  Also heads the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas.
  Kathleen Ward. Most people either like or dislike her. She is passionate about the subject, yet sarcastic and incredibly demanding. Very interesting teacher  youll either enjoy her anecdotes and usage of outdated names or sink into your seat. She teaches LIN 1, 106, 160, and 163.
  Michael T. Wescoat. Teaches Linguistics 1 and various upper division and graduate classes. Very approachable if one has questions about the subject matter.
  Vai Ramanathan. Mainly teaches graduate courses, but occasionally dips into upper division to teach 165. Great professor, encourages discussion, and usually always has easily relatable/relevant topics.
  Orhan Orgun. Usually teaches 111 and 112. Very wellliked, easygoing, and humorous professor with an intense passion for phonology (which is to be expected).
  David Corina. Teaches 177. Very into psycholinguistics and works at the Center for Mind and Brain. Great professor (though he does give off the absentminded professor vibe, and very approachable if you want to talk about psycholinguistics.
  Jack Hawkins. Teaches 150/152 and some graduate courses. Professor Emeritus of Cambridge, and an expert in language universals and typology, especially between English and German (has a book out). Very interesting, knows everything about every language, and has a really cool British accent.
