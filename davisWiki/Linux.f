wiki:wikipedia:Linux Linux is an open source operating system that is Living Cheaply free in wiki:wikipedia:Gratis_versus_Libre more than one way. Most relevant to communityminded Davis is the philosophy that drives Linux development: (1) you should be able to know exactly how your operating system works, (2) you should be able to change it if you dont like how it works, and (3) you should be able to freely share it with others.  Its no surprise that the DavisWiki System Info is served off a Linux machine.

Linux is freely downloadable online (e.g. see options on http://distrowatch.com/ distrowatch.com) and allows you to run a treasure trove of high quality free software applications.  The software most useful to the academic community (office suites, mathematics and statistics, and Internet communications) is well represented, and some recent distributions of the OS have gotten so http://www.ubuntu.com/ userhttp://www.kubuntu.org/ friendly that 9 out of 10 grandmothers can use it.

The Computer Science computer science major at UC Davis is very Linux/Unix centered. As such, many students taking CS classes run some variant of Linux on their machines so they dont have to live in CSIF the dungeon. Apple Inc. OS X also works for this purpose.
