20070817 10:07:19 nbsp If you disagree with an opinion on an entry, add your opinion.  While Wikipedia works via NPOV, trying to eliminated points of view, Davis Wiki generally works on APOV, or Aggregate Point of View, where all editors add different points of view to an entry until it accumulates the various opinions of Davis itself.  If you have a different take on something, add it... just try to phrase it so that the varying points of view read well and can be compared to each other by the readerFootnote(And feel free to ignore this advice... its just what Ive found works well within the wiki).
