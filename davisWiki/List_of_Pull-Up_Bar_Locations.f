Society has overemphasized (even sex fetishized) the pectoral muscles and their concomitant exercises, the bench press and the pushup.  Break free of those mental chains, Do some pullups instead!  Tell society that your lats are tired of being ignored!

Davis is no exception to this brainwashing.  Along with asymmetrical hate of convenient shopping (like Target, WalMart or Costco), Davis Cows poopoos the bodys desire to do pullups!  That is to say, Davis is all pec and no lat.  Nonetheless, heres a list of otherwiseunpublished places that do have pullup bars:

Free, Outdoor Locations:
  North Davis Fitness Trail
  Toomey Field
  Walnut Park

NonFree Locations:
  the ARC Activities and Recreation Center


Do the yang to the pushup yin.  Dont let Davis turn you into an android.  No more flabby lats!
