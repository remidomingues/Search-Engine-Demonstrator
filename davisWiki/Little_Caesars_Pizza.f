20090702 17:30:37 nbsp Got a $5 HotNReady pizza today, pretty good for a $5 pizza. Its quick too, I was in and out within a minute with the pizza in hand. Users/ahsu

20090702 20:54:10 nbsp Cant wait to try it! had fond memories of the Marketplace location with its memory game (victory got you free breadsticks, etc) Users/StevenDaubert

20090712 12:35:22 nbsp Really great location, I work here. The owner is really nice and the company really takes pride in the pizza making process! Try the crazy bread or Italian Cheese Bread if you decide to give it a try, its sooooo good. Users/TICKtacTOEtag

20090712 19:08:24 nbsp Putting high standards aside, the $5 pizza is a pretty good deal on a day with no time and two mouths to feed.  In fact, bonus for the fact that the pizza is ready to eat and cheaper than any super salty gourmet frozen pizza.  But, again, not exactly going to be a staple in my pizza diet.  Just great when youre in a crunch or lazier than youd care to admit. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090713 00:13:11 nbsp Does this location deliver? Users/hankim

20090817 13:53:11 nbsp hotnreadys are a steal for the price.  its unfortunate that you have to pay for the packaged sauces but its understandable since their only source of revenue seems to come from the 5 dollar pizzas.   Users/BenLee

20090822 16:21:22 nbsp I suppose, if you were ever so desperate for something edible but was incredibly lazy, and all you had was $5, Little Caesars is the place to go. However, if you do not meet the above criteria, then please stay far, far away. A $5 pizza that you get for under a minute is exactly how you think it would taste! Users/blastoff

20090825 23:01:57 nbsp This is a great deal. I hope they put that nasty place Cenarios out of business. No its not the greatest pizza ever, but its tasty and it doesnt break the bank. We are in a recession after all. Users/Dozer

20090902 20:19:31 nbsp I am so happy that a Little Caesars opened in Davis.  Now I dont have to waste gas going to Woodland to get cheap pizza!  And it tastes good; honestly I like it better than several of the $20 pizzas Ive had in Davis. Users/hokusman

20090902 22:31:22 nbsp The pizzas alright (for $5 its an incredible deal though). The Asian girl who works the counter is really nice!  Users/jsogul

20091201 20:02:45 nbsp Its a nice place to work (I used to work there). I love the pizza and Italian Cheese Bread is my fave! To answer a previous comment and many calls that Little Caesars gets, yes, they do deliver! Users/MarjaGMorgan
  Is there a minimum for five dollar pizzas to be delivered? And how much is the delivery charge? Users/hankim

20091202 15:58:28 nbsp Their pizzas arent bad. I like their crust, soft and chewy. I asked the cashier how many pizzas they sell a day and he said 200300. Thats insane!  Users/AvidSpots

20091214 16:00:29 nbsp Unfortunately, Little Caesars in Davis does NOT deliver. They cant afford it! Perhaps something in the future? But despite popular belief, they do make and roll all their dough onsite (nonfrozen), and prepped onsite as well. Their HotNReadys are sold constantly and new ones are always being thrown in the oven so the pizza never sits in the hot box for more than 10 minutes or so. Ask them about specialty pizzas, they usually cost under ten dollars and are made right away, more toppings than the HotnReady. Its really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, its a good deal for 5 bucks.    Users/Jester
  Darn, if they did deliver I would live off their stuff. Users/hankim

20100108 15:24:38 nbsp I seriously get the HotNReady pizza every other week because its so convenient and cheap! And its not bad pizza for only 5 dollars. I have had to wait a few times to get the cheese pizza, and it seems like they dont have as many HotNReady cheeses and they do pepperonis, but my wait time was always under 10 minutes. If you want cheap and easy, definitely go for Little Caesars. Users/emmaleanne

20100519 09:49:56 nbsp Do they deliver? Users/JKx788
  Nope according to another comment. Users/hankim
  I think Ive seen a little caesars car driving around though. Maybe they use it for something else? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100519 13:48:29 nbsp The owner of this place is often working behind the counter and is super nice to his customers. Users/DagonJones

20100519 17:15:42 nbsp Deep dish for 7 bucks is amazing, its square as well! Users/StevenDaubert

20100608 22:08:33 nbsp Go next door, to Cenarios Pizza, and buy a better pizza with better service for 46 cents more.
I just came from little caesars, got there at 9:45, and they told me they were closed and wouldnt serve me.
I usually go to little caesars once a week, now Ill got next door once a week.
You just lost my business, Ill give it to Cenarios Pizza once a week now.    Users/Shaodw

20110622 00:08:03 nbsp Probably the best pizza place in Davis. They dont slather their pizza in oil like other places and its the best deal you could get. On some days I went there and they have specials (like with olives or bellpepper) for the same $5. Owners are nice and friendly too Users/JohnathonJosephs

20111119 22:59:11 nbsp I believe that Little Caesars very graciously donated quite a few pizzas (I dont know exactly how manyI saw at least half a dozen large boxes) to the peaceful protest of Chancellor Katehis planned press conference this evening. Several hundred hungry students appreciated it! :) Users/zombiek

20120210 18:53:39 nbsp MULTO BENE!!!!! THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTICO ITALIANO!!!!! The BEST PIZZA IN DAVIS!!!! Users/KCSlater

20120305 15:51:35 nbsp Pretty good food for the price.  It seems odd that you have to purchase the bread and dipping sauce separately, though. Users/LoriOrf

20120305 16:22:47 nbsp I really like the prices, and I eat their pizzas more often than Id like to admit. But I  always get a stomachache from eating them. I know its not food poisoning, but there is apparently some ingredients used here that my body has trouble digesting. Ive never have this problem at any other pizza place. Users/ScottMeehleib

20121111 23:18:51 nbsp While it is true that the pizza is pretty good for the $5 price, I had a terrible experience with the cashier here. I ordered some Hotnready cheese pizza. Unfortunately, she mixed up the order and thought I said pepperoni. She did not confirm with me, and I did not notice the mistake until I got home. When I called back asking to make the order right, she told me that they could not help me because I left the store. Eventually she gave me the appropriate order, but not without fighting me every step of the way. Suffice it to say, I will not come back. Next time I need cheap pizza, I will go to Dominoes instead.  Users/NyssaSpector

20130302 13:11:58 nbsp The service is terrible, the food always makes my stomach hurt. The food is cheap for a reason, I only go here when on a tight budget. Users/NobleMason

20130723 17:51:53 nbsp Weve found the service here to be fine. When they took longer on an order than expected, they gave me some free crazy bread as an apology. We far prefer their rectangular deepdish pizza over their standard pizzas, but they are a little pricier and you have to wait 15 minutes. Totally worth it. Very good pizza, quite thick. I had them make extra cuts for smaller pieces and brought it to a potluck for kids, and it was perfect. Users/EvaG

20131108 16:15:15 nbsp I called in and told them I wanted 2 deep dish pizzas and asked to have it ready for me to pick it up an hour and a half later than the time I called. They said they would have it ready by then. I came in 5 minutes after the time I asked them to pick it up and my pizzas still werent ready. I had to wait an extra 20 minutes for my pizza to be done. They should know how long it would take to make the pizzas, plus I called an HOUR AND A HALF before wanting to pick it up, it should have been ready by the time I got there. Other than that, prices on the pizzas are fair and I would only go with the deep dish. The $5 pizzas kinda suck. But you get what you pay for. Users/JaceWinter

20140415 22:10:45 nbsp Im mad because instead of the $5 hot and ready pizza, its $5.99. Its not too big of a difference, but it was a lot simpler before. The crazy bread is crazy good (: Users/YoungResident
