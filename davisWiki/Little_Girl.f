She is very very small (even for a mouse) and enjoys burrowing, especially under sunflowers. In fact, she lives under a dried sunflower from the Farmers Market.



Technically, she is named phi, but she is never called that.  She is in the line of mice such as i, pi and e (who was better known as Little Bean).  Her companion is New Bean.

Their Users/TarZxf roommate has dubbed her the Poop Machine due to her ability to excrete more mass than she has every two nanoseconds.  It is quite a feat of quantum physics.

  She is small, figure 15 grams, that would be 7500 metric tons/sec.  That is about right.  Users/SarahHillard
