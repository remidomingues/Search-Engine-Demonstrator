 Cover Charge
Cover charge on special events. Occasionally the entrance fee is redeemable for drinks inside the establishment
.
Little Prague was one of a growing number of bars in town that charged a cover fee for entrance. The cover charge policy has since been altered, now only charging cover for special events and fundraisers for various UCD groups.

You can easily avoid cover charge at any bar in Davis by simply going early (prior to 10:00pm) and grabbing a cheap beer along with your stamps/wristbands.

The cover charge may be higher if it is a special event, or may be replaced entirely for donations to other entities such as the Law Schools various fundraisers and other types of events.

20110303 16:20:12 nbsp At one point in time, Little Prague wouldnt give free glasses of water at night.  Is that still the policy? Users/TomGarberson
  has not been the policy for as long as I have worked there (Since Mar 2010), and stopped being an issue long before that. They have a water cooler for all those who need an immediate water fix, but if you ask any of the barstaff (depending on how busy they are) for a cup of H2O they will gladly hand you one, with or without ice. If I am working, I will grab a glass for any who ask and bring it to you if at all able to.

20110501 01:23:28 nbsp Only place I go now.  Great bartenders who get to know the regulars and take care of them  amazing in my book.  Bruce, Wes and Han all make little prague the place I enjoy most :) Users/OliviaY

20110525 16:15:12 nbsp Go here on Saturdays! They have a new DJ who not only plays good music, but actually takes requests. The drinks are good, the atmosphere is great, and with the addition of the good dance music, Prague is the SPOT in Davis on Saturdays. I havent experienced any of the issues others have commented on. All in all a really fun place to drink/hang out. Users/JuanaBNDavis

      My husband and I became regulars at Little Prague about two months ago, almost instantly after moving to Davis in April 2011. The patio is gorgeous and we enjoyed the food, which isnt as great as Ive had in the Czech Republic but decent for small college town America. We also went to the bar often after dinner for a beer or a glass of scotch. For the most part, the staff is very nice and attempts to be helpful. The owner, on occasion, seemed rude to the staff, but I never needed to interact with him so I didnt realize the extent to which he despises his customers, or perhaps only his customers of color. There are cultural issues in the Czech republic relative to the treatment of people of color these issues traveling to the United States with the immigrants though, is unacceptable in the public sphere.

     On the particular night in question, my husband, a friend and I went to the bar, we ordered a beer and a glass of wine and paid for them. We decided to order another round, and my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and left the tab open this time. Since we frequent the bar often (about once a week or more) the staff knows us well, my husband routinely leaves the tab open and I order on his tab or close it as necessary. After my husband finished his beer, I went in to order another beer and close the tab. The bartender I was ordering with was busy and I would have preferred to wait for her, because the owner seems so contemptuous. Unfortunately the owner spotted me at the bar and engaged me in conversation, he started starring at me and said, Well are you going to order something”. His tone was dismissive and aggressive at the same time, and he was looking at the men at the bar instead of looking at me while he spoke, trying to engage them in what was becoming a confrontation, rather than a conversation. I attempted to pronounce the name of the Czech beer, which may not have been perfect. Of course the owner himself has a horrendous accent while speaking English, but that isn’t something we penalize people for in the free world. I told him I had a tab open and spelled the last name instead of pronouncing it, because it is a foreign name and he would not be able to understand. He became irate yet again and said, I dont know you. I elicited the help of the bartender, whose attention I had attracted by this point, including the attention of much of those seated at the bar, who found my husbands credit card. The owner then looked at the ID and the card and said, “this isnt you, you cant sign for this man” (I had told him Id like to close the tab and leave and did not want the beer). I then went to the patio and fetched my husband to sign for his card. My husband was told he had not spent enough money to close this tab. My husband offered to let them charge the requisite $10 on the card as he just wanted to leave the place at that point, but was told he must make another purchase. Luckily, I produced a $10 bill and was able to recover our credit card and ID and escape the dastardly place.

      It really saddens me, but I will not return to this establishment again, nether will my husband who is faculty at UC Davis and he wont be holding any outings with his colleagues at this establishment. Little Prague offers mediocre food with a side of terrible service and occasionally a little bit of old fashioned Eastern European fascism circa 1933. There are plenty of fine establishments to choose form in this town, I am sad that weve spent so much of our hard earned money at this particular one.  Users/ZeeZee

20110618 03:29:37 nbsp The two previous comments are about a sad situation among many.  Is the owner sexist and racist or an equal opportunity disher of beration and obnoxiousness?   Users/BruceHansen

20110724 19:20:51 nbsp I had a somewhat irritating visit here this afternoon.  A friend and I stopped in before a movie, since we arrived downtown 45 minutes early.  It was around 3:15, and there was only one other person at the bar.  The bartender greeted us, then took an order from the other patron.  Then she came and went from the bar at least 3 times, each time telling us, sorry, be right with you.  It was 810 minutes before she actually took our order.  She then poured our beers, and got a good 2.5 of head on my Sierra Nevada.  At least she didnt serve it that way; instead, she said itd be a few minutes, since there was a lot of foam on it.  Rather than pour off the head and fill up the glass, she waited a good 34 minutes for half an inch or so of foam to disappear, then topped it off, pouring off a little bit of the foam.  I dont mind an imperfect pour, but come on.  If youre charging $4.50 for a pint of Sierra (which is $2.99 for an imperial pint, i.e. 20oz glass, at The Davis Beer Shoppe), you can afford to pour off the 1/8 oz. youll lose in head from a bad pour, rather than making the customer wait for it to fizzle off.

Despite getting there when the place was all but empty 40 minutes before our movie started, we had to hurry a bit to finish our drinks and head over to catch the show.  Thats just bad service.

(On a side note, the bartender was friendly enough when we werent being ignored) Users/TomGarberson

20110818 00:26:46 nbsp This is seriously one of the most disappointing bars in Davis. The bar service is always awful  it takes way too long to order a drink, and the bartenders never pay attention to the order of people who have been waiting. It makes it hard to come and enjoy the bar, since the outdoor seating is really great and theres always randomly awesome dancing.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20120427 23:18:57 nbsp As of last month, I am never going back to this establishment. There are two reasons.

One the owner is a complete creep. The couple of times that I went there before my last visit, he would gawk and drool over all the hot girls and guys in our group. While its clear that hes married, he certainly doesnt act like it when hes out groping his way through the hot college students that he hires as staff. I think its only a matter of time before someone sues him for harassment  and I wouldnt be surprised if it was a client and not a staff.

Two  he or his wife kick people out of the place, even after theyve ordered food and drinks, if the customers havent ordered enough food. Heres what happened on my last visit  knowing that the bar is almost always completely empty, I had suggested to my study group that we meet there for our meeting. Once there, half the people ordered drinks, and a couple more ordered nibbles. Being students, not everyone ordered both a drink and an appetizer. While we talked about our work, it became obvious that the owners wife was glaring at us and at the bartender. After a while the bartender came over and apologized saying the boss needs everyone to order an appetizer and a drink, or Im going to have to ask you all to leave.  Seriously?  The place was empty.  We were sitting in the window making the place look lively and inviting, and shes dictating what it is that we need to order?  So we asked if we could just finish our orders before leaving, and the old lady said NO! Order or get out.  So we left our table half finished. On the way out I went to boss lady and I said You do realize that this is a small town, and even if it wasnt a small town, you do realize that people talk about things like this. She just frowned as said You can only stay if you pay To which I replied So youd rather have an EMPTY bar, without ANY customers, instead of having a dozen people with half of them paying for your food and drinks?

So instead we now go to Delta, or Luigis to meet and we are welcomed with open arms.

In short, creepy, lecherous and sexually confused owner and mean wife make this place #1 on our local no go list. Users/ChuckFrank

20120723 17:54:35 nbsp  Banned from Little Prague because I stole a cake from a bar? 

Last weekend, in high spirits and high expectations, I visited Little Prague with my boyfriend and my friends for a drink. While on the dance floor, my boyfriend and I unexpectedly got tapped on the shoulder by the manager and were told to follow him. Confused, I thought perhaps he just wanted to check our ids, so I willingly followed him to his office, not really thinking anything of it. He told us to sit down. Without any introduction or explanation of what was going on, he and one of his employees stated, I know that we served you Wednesday night. He continued to point to his computer at an extremely blurry stillphoto from a surveillance camera and said, This is you. Absolutely DUMBFOUNDED, I told the manager and the employee that I was confused and that they have obviously been mistaken because I never visited Little Prague on Wednesday. Specifically and honestly, I told them that I was at home that night watching Netflix (Breaking Bad to be specific) and that my boyfriend was in Fairfield at the time. Additionally, my boyfriend pointed out that its impossible to discern even the faintest characteristics of the people on the photo, not to mention that I do not bring a purse to a bar (I have a phone with a slot for credit cards and my license) and that the height difference between the two individuals wasnt even close to our height relationship. The manager and the employee did not even respond to these statements. They repeatedly claimed that we were apparently those people on the photo. Now that the situation has become even more ridiculous at this point and they are continuing to detain us in the room, we ask what in fact are you accusing us of? The manager said, You stole a cake. Now, to be honest, I almost laughed, because the notion that I stole a CAKE from a BAR on a night that I wasnt even out of my house is absurd. And the fact that he wouldnt even give me the decency or the respect to hear me out, made it even more ridiculous. It gets worse. He told me and my boyfriend that we were banned forever from the bar and that he was calling the cops immediately. Now that I feel completely violated at this point, I tell him to check my credit card records. I swear to you, the manager responded with, What good would that do? My boyfriend answered as any individual would with common sense, and he said, It would prove if we bought alcohol here and what time we would have been here. The employee informed us that he couldnt remember if I paid in cash or credit card. Naturally, we responded with the likes of, How is it possible that you vividly remember, at 110% capacity, that we were here specifically and that YOU served US for HOURS, but you cant remember if I used cash or credit card? It only seems reasonable that such a notorious cake thief would have made an impression upon the bartender as to what method of payment they used for hours. With this in mind, the employee had nothing to say, and we were told to leave the room and sit at the table. When we asked for our licenses back, the manager refused. We told him we would call the cops and he said they were already on their way. Shortly thereafter, we were kicked out of the bar and were told that we were banned forever  for allegedly stealing a cake. At this point I am legitimately crying outside and distressed because 1) the manager at Little Prague ruined my night, and the night of my friends, by making a scene out of something so petty and ridiculous 2) he called the COPS on a situation that was completely a waste of time for the authorities 3) he falsely accused me and made me feel like a criminal for something I didnt even do 4) he treated me with complete disrespect and without the decency to even listen to my completely rational explanations, nor did he even consider, for an instant, that he might have been mistaken. This is a man who is so prideful, so opinionated, and so unreasonably spiteful that he cant see through the tearful eyes of a woman who is telling the simple truth. In fact, at seeing his true character, I almost believe that he was deliberately provoking me deliberately making me so angry so that I WOULD do something wrong, so that I would fulfill his expectations because he couldnt bear to accept the fact that he was mistaken and that he should apologize.

Obviously, since I am banned for stealing a cake, I will never return to Little Prague. However, many of the people who witnessed this night have been left with bitter distaste at the way this business acts and how it treats its honest paying customers, and they have likewise vowed to never go back. Now, this is just my individual story and I am not preaching to people to them them not to visit this establishment. But by taking into consideration my story and coupling it with the widespread negative reviews of this place on Daviswiki, it goes without saying that there is something disturbingly wrong with this place.

        While awful for you, this is one of the more comical Vaclav stories. The guy is an egomaniacal tyrant, though some people have slightly nicer ways of saying the same thing about him. I remember when he put those cameras in years ago, it was like he was just hungry for the conflict. I think in some ways hes responsible for his own problems; he wanted a cool hot spot, and with that comes more people, and maybe even a cake thief here and there. And frankly, if youre going to steal something here, its got to be the cakes. The princess cake is amazing. Either way, sorry this happened to you. Im no law person, but check out this info on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopkeepers_privilege shopkeepers privilege. Seems like he wasnt really keen on any actual investigating, just being a total ass, but welcome to Little Prague! Users/DavidBenjamin

       @ Users/CakeThief, how crazy that this happened to you! Did the police actually show up? I have never been a super fan of Little Prauge, but now I dont think I will give them my business at all, even if they do serve Black Lion Beer.  Users/jsbmeb

20120725 17:10:03 nbsp @ jsbmeb, Yes a cop did in fact show up; however, he did not take any of my information or even address any issues with any of us. I actually had to approach him in order to initiate a conversation. Obviously, he thought the entire situation was ridiculous and a waste of his time, and he was just responded to a call and making sure things were under control...which they were, I guess you could say, except for the manager being crazy. Users/CakeThief

20130304 18:16:59 nbsp I have been a regular customer of this establishment for about a year now and have to say that I rather enjoy the atmosphere.  The night scene throughout the week has a lot of different styles of music flowing.  There is even live Jazz is the restaurant next door on Saturdays from 610pm.  If you are a fan of Jazz, this is the place to go in Davis.  All three gentlemen are amazing to converse with about a vast myriad of topics.  If your cup of tea is more in tune with a club scene, there are live DJs Wednesday through Saturday.  On Wednesdays and Saturdays, a local group of talented audiophiles put on RECESS, an Electronic Dance Music themed night.  On Thursdays and Fridays there are differing styles each week, usually top forty mixed with R&B and a sprinkling of different themes (more detail to be added later).  While the owner tends to come off as aggressive, I think people just need to realize that he simply has a different style than most Americans.  I have seen his interactions with customers and must say that he has been learning how to interact better with the customers he serves.  The main people he seems to have issues with are those who have disrespected either the establishment, his staff, or himself.  I have yet to see him go out of his way to give people a hard time.  He simply reacts to how people approach him.  The staff at the bar is spectacular.  They are personable and professional, as well as a funloving group.

Allinall:
A great night scene with the biggest dance floor in Davis, even without opening up the restaurant bar.
One of the best bar staff in town.
Certainly one of the most diverse collection of musical styles of ANY of the bars.
Dont forget to order some Devils Toast at the bar.  Hands down, one of the best munchies at a Davis bar. Users/P.Red

20130824 07:53:18 nbsp I never make it here when Im on a bar crawl since its just far away enough and quiet enough I am never tempted. I did go for karaoke night once, which was fun but pretty dead (not surprising considering its on Monday nights)... Ive been only one other time, and the bartenders are always really nice (for my birthday, one made a specialty raspberry drink that was amazing) and really great at what they do. Ive never eaten here. All in all, not too bad of a place.  Users/HannahToru

20131014 21:08:19 nbsp I was DD a couple weeks ago and brought some people here. When they said last call they also closed the bathroom. Security wouldnt let me or anybody in my group use the bathroom, even though it was still 10 min before closing. Then one of the bouncers made some rude comments toward my GF.

When I found the supervisor, he was obviously wasted, and kicked us out when I tried to complain.

I used to go here all the time, but never again. Users/hobobot
