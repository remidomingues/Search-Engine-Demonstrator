Little Prague is a Czech restaurant.  Maybe youve never had Czech food before, but dont be afraid  its just good, hearty food.  The Happy Hour Drink happy hour at Little Prague is a good deal, with tasty 24oz. glasses of beer for $4.00, as well as 1/2 price appetizers like potato pancakes, deepfried cauliflower, Duck Nuggets and more.  For meat lovers, Little Prague also offers an assortment of European sausages, such as Bratwurst, Bockwurst, and Rindswurst, which vary from pork to allbeef varieties (also 1/2 off during Happy Hour).  Their bakery section (The Farmers Wife) sells bread to many of our local grocers and makes wedding cakes along with the multiple varieties of cakes available every day.

The ambiance, however, isnt always so hospitable.  The owner of the L.P. is considered by many of the below reviewers to be a real piece of work  rude, autocratic, and possessed of his own unique take on the Romantic, European charms of Bohemian dining. He has been known to kick people out if you do not order enough food or such things as wrongfully accusing people of theft. Please read comments below for stories before you decide to support this owners business. There are many other tastier, cheaper, restaurants with good service.

Little Prague is a bit pricey (it is, after all, considered an Upscale Restaurants upscale restaurant by some).

It should be noted that Little Prague is actually two separate businesses, the restaurant and the bar.

The space next door which was previously occupied by the Salvation Army Salvation Army Thrift Store is now the Little Prague Bar, a separate business extension of Little Prague with occasional live music and near nightly DJs.  There is a small cover charge of $3.00 for DJ nights ThursSat, cover charge (depending on Band and their fees when they play) for live Bands on Mondays.  In 2008, they started offering free water in a big orange cooler located on the bar near the dance floor. Former to that action, their Little Prague/Former Water Policy water policy was controversial.

It should also be noted that, while they do charge a minimum on credit card orders of Credit Card Minimum Purchase $10, it is generally lower than any other bar in town. They also have an ATMs ATM machine which does charge a fee for some cards if you wish to avoid the minimum order. Other than that bring cash and, like any other establishment, remember to Tipping tip for your service.

The Little Prague building was originally home to the Blue and Gold diner and later the Blue Mango restaurant.

20100324 19:59:29 nbsp Im writing a review on the restaurant.  It was quite pricey and the portions did not match the price.  The soup that came with my meal tasted like something out of a Campbells soup can.  I ordered a dish with a pork chop, sausage, sauerkraut, and potato pancakes.  It looked pretty impressive, but I was disappointed.  Half of the plate was bland, and the other half was over seasoned and very salty.  Maybe the kitchen staff had a bad day or maybe this type of cuisine is not for me.  Service on the other hand was very attentive and friendly.  My party received multiple refills on our bread.  I would considering giving this place another try.       Users/BenLee

20100329 16:09:48 nbsp I am always surprised to see this restaurant is still in business. Yes, they have a wonderful patio (probably the best in town). And their cakes are good. So is their violinist who adds a very nice touch when he is there. They also have a good happy hour. But I have never thought much of their food (probably more due to the style of the cuisine than to its execution) and the owner is about the rudest person I have ever met. I for some time tried to give the restaurant a chance, but I got tired of making reservations only to then have to wait 20 minutes for my table after arriving (even when the restaurant was only partially full), all the while being pointedly ignored by the owner, then having to experience less than stellar service and mediocre food. I can put up with a lot, but an owner who shows actual contempt for his customers is too much to bear, or at least not something I like paying for. And to the extent it matters, no, I am not a college student. My bad experiences with the restaurant have been when I was in my 40s and when dressed in businesscasual or better attire (not that that should make any difference in how you are treated when you are a paying customer of a restaurant). I keep hoping that this restaurant will go out of business so some better restaurant with a nicer owner can make use of its wonderful space, but it somehow keeps hanging on . . . Users/ToNils

20100330 15:36:41 nbsp We had lunch at Little Prague today and were quite pleased.  Judging from his accent, I assume that we were served by the owner.  Both my wife and I had the chicken schnitzel.  The portion size was perfect for me, and my wife gave me about 1/4 of hers because she had all that she wanted to eat.  Ive always wanted to have one of their deliciouslooking desserts, but was so full from lunch or dinner that it required a return trip later.

All I can comment on is based on our experience.  Some people might describe the service as slow, but I think this is more of a cultural difference and expectations set by too many corporate places.  Dining is an art in Europe, and serving is considered to be a worthy profession, unlike here, where its something that one does to get through college or until a better job comes along.  Our server came back to the table to explain that he was brewing another pot of tea, after I had asked for a refill.  There is even something near the front of the menu about eating and talking slowly; something that many Americans could do to improve themselves.

As far as the comment about being checked on too frequently, blame corporate restaurants for the strict time standards and steps of service they require of servers.  Me, Id rather not have a menu thrust at me before by butt even hits the seat. Users/JMLowman

20100611 09:46:13 nbsp . I went there for the World Cup special.  I have been to the restaurant before and enjoined their brunch.  Kudos to the owner for the good idea of combining breakfast with the big screen TVs in time for the 7AM game.

Unfortunately, it was understaffed (only the owner working) with about 2530 customers, served lower quality food, and was overpriced.  The omelette ingredients were beyond skimpy: 1 tablespoon of cheese on top (which was $2.50 extra) and nothing at all inside since they forgot the ham.  Other omlettes at the table were equally flat despite the order arriving with all the ingredients ordered.  I asked the owner about the cheese not being a standard ingredient, but he was either unable to understand my point or saying that their omelettes dont normally have cheese.  I remembered ordering an omelette during brunch there before, so I took a glance at the restaurant menu.  Cheese was included with each omelette.

The coffee was $2, which is a normal price, but then the unsolicited refill from the owner was also added to the tab for another $2.  Clarification on the bar menu might be in a good idea so that people know what to expect.  Water was not served or available for me to serve myself.  Instead the owner had a special for $1 bottles of water.  This was inside of a bar, but it was 7AM and everyone was eating breakfast and drinking coffee, not alcohol.  Water should at least be in a large jug for us to serve ourselves.

It was a nice idea to have a place to eat breakfast and watch the early morning World Cup games, but the reality fell short.  I left feeling exploited and annoyed.  None of the prices on single dishes were exorbitant; it was the unexpected and relentless nickelanddiming that did me in.Users/cyraemery

  Perhaps they read your comments (or heard from others) and made changes where needed. By the time I went on 6/23, the coffee was selfserve and bottomless, and there were at least 4 servers for a fullhouse 7 a.m. game. Dont know if the food changed, though. JoRo

20100810 08:38:54 nbsp Went for dinner last night...the customer service was good and the staff was friendly. And while I believe the food is very overpriced, it is pretty good. The desserts are awesome! Users/jsbmeb

20100811 11:18:42 nbsp Ive never eaten here, but have been here many times at night while at the bars. I always get a weird feeling here  theyre not totally friendly, and some of the staff think theyre cooler than they are. They also cannot mix drinks AT ALL. The bartender didnt know that 7 referred to 7 up! We had to tell her how to make the drink, and after getting it made twice, I couldnt even drink it. If you drink here, just stick to beer. Users/aggie2009
  Most likely this was not a bartender, but a waitress at the restaurant next door who helps from time to time and, on a very rare occasion, is there by herself. Very highly doubt it actually happened this way though. As for who in the bar you had an experience with that feels they are cooler than they are I am curious as to the details of this interaction.

20101214 18:41:19 nbsp Sigh. Went here for lunch on Saturday because my husband loves it. Like Ive said before, its good, but not good enough for the prices. That being said the service was good as was the food. It was a little weird when we were seated though the owner was nice but only handed us one menu for 6 people and then he said we had to choose between the reg. menu and the special menu right then and there. He was cool though when we asked if we could order off the dinner menu...the husband loves the sausage plate. Users/jsbmeb

20110217 20:36:14 nbsp I went there the evening of Feb. 13th for an early valentines day dessert... MISTAAAAKE! The dessert was awful, the coffee weak and mediocre, and the price high (for the awful quality.) We ordered 2 pieces of cake to share chocolate fudge and carrot cake. The chocolate cake was cold and hard, and tasted of freezer burn. The carrot cake didnt taste like anything and the frosting was really cheap tasting. The cost came to $19 with tax and tip. My recommendation save your $ and go to the Nugget where the desserts are fresh and delicious and apparently have been made within the last week! Users/MommyScientist

20110318 12:25:24 nbsp Hell hath no fury like a writer scorned.  This is my review of what I anticipated was going to be a wonderful, fun St. Patricks day at Little Prague:  http://www.funnytheworld.com/2011/Mar/18.htm  (I wont be back). Users/BevSykes


20110550 21:48:29 nbsp The desserts here are amazing.  The food is not so good, though we did get a steak with whipped cream on it  interesting!  The one time we ate there we were sick for 3 days :(  The bar has good ambiance and some of the bar tenders are really cool.  Wish they had more beer options though   Users/bobobb

20110615 01:25:26 nbsp       My husband and I became regulars at Little Prague about two months ago, almost instantly after moving to Davis in April 2011.  The patio is gorgeous and we enjoyed the food, which isnt as great as Ive had in the Czech Republic but decent for small college town America.  We also went to the bar often after dinner for a beer or a glass of scotch.  For the most part, the staff is very nice and attempts to be helpful.  The owner, on occasion, seemed rude to the staff, but I never needed to interact with him so I didnt realize the extent to which he despises his customers, or perhaps only his customers of color.   There are cultural issues in the Czech republic relative to the treatment of people of color these issues traveling to the United States with the immigrants though, is unacceptable in the public sphere.

     On the particular night in question, my husband, a friend and I went to the bar, we ordered a beer and a glass of wine and paid for them.   We decided to order another round, and my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and left the tab open this time.  Since we frequent the bar often (about once a week or more) the staff knows us well, my husband routinely leaves the tab open and I order on his tab or close it as necessary.  After my husband finished his beer, I went in to order another beer and close the tab.  The bartender I was ordering with was busy and I would have preferred to wait for her, because the owner seems so contemptuous.  Unfortunately the owner spotted me at the bar and engaged me in conversation, he started starring at me and said, Well are you going to order something”. His tone was dismissive and aggressive at the same time, and he was looking at the men at the bar instead of looking at me while he spoke, trying to engage them in what was becoming a confrontation, rather than a conversation.   I attempted to pronounce the name of the Czech beer, which may not have been perfect.  Of course the owner himself has a horrendous accent while speaking English, but that isn’t something we penalize people for in the free world.   I told him I had a tab open and spelled the last name instead of pronouncing it, because it is a foreign name and he would not be able to understand.  He became irate yet again and said, I dont know you. I elicited the help of the bartender, whose attention I had attracted by this point, including the attention of much of those seated at the bar, who found my husbands credit card.  The owner then looked at the ID and the card and said, “this isnt you, you cant sign for this man” (I had told him Id like to close the tab and leave and did not want the beer).  I then went to the patio and fetched my husband to sign for his card.  My husband was told he had not spent enough money to close this tab.  My husband offered to let them charge the requisite $10 on the card as he just wanted to leave the place at that point, but was told he must make another purchase.  Luckily, I produced a $10 bill and was able to recover our credit card and ID and escape the dastardly place.

     It really saddens me, but I will not return to this establishment again, nether will my husband who is faculty at UC Davis and he wont be holding any outings with his colleagues at this establishment.  Little Prague offers mediocre food with a side of terrible service and occasionally a little bit of old fashioned Eastern European fascism circa 1933. There are plenty of fine establishments to choose form in this town, I am sad that weve spent so much of our hard earned money at this particular one.

20110615 01:30:25 nbsp How sad that if it wasnt for tonight this review would have been somewhat positive.  I have good reason to believe that the owners of this place do not want customers who arent their own particular ilk, whatever that may be.  The food is decent, although the goulash does not compare to what ive had in the Czech republic.  The sausages are good but how can you go wrong with a sausage. If you choose to visit this place, despite the fact that is is probably owned and operated by racist, antisemitic nazis, then order the soups, they are the best thing on the menu.  I have personally been run out of this place and refused service.  The waiters and bartenders are not the problem, its the management and the owner and I choose to vote with my money and never patronize this place again.  Users/ZeeZee

20110731 22:31:14 nbsp I came in today and got a piece of carrot cake. It was over $6 (which I knew before ordering so that was fine) but my boyfriend and I both found it horrible. It was way too sweet. We didnt even finish it.   Users/JanaShute

20111224 12:17:10 nbsp Little Prague Restaurant is an absolute gem.  It is a bit pricey, but it’s great for something special like when guests come to town.  Lenka has been our waitress numerous times, and makes great suggestions on both food and beer.  The food is amazing—all the goulashes, anything with a dumpling or sausage, the beef stroganoff, chicken schnitzel—it’s Bohemian heaven if you’re into that.  It was here that I learned the word “robot” was coined by a Czech—I have wowed many a person at cocktail parties with this fun fact.  Someone above comments on their treatment of people of color— not everyone in my family is white, but we have been all treated really well there.  Unfortunately I can’t eat most of the foods here anymore because of dietary issues, but you probably can, so go!!

20120523 11:12:54 nbsp Horrible little restaurant with extremely unfriendly owners. The food is PASSABLE, but just barely. Will never return. Users/FoodsterDan

20120530 10:53:42 nbsp Mr. Owner,
Why dont you learn from these negative comments? I am a woman who was born and raised here. I am a professional not a young college student. You should be taking care of all of your patrons. Dont forget this is a college town the students here are making it possible for some of us to have jobs!
Your food and desserts are decent but freshness is what we want and it is lacking in your restaurant. Your prices are too high for what you get. You try to stick it to us every chance you get. Charging for a refill of coffee! Really? I have loved the location of your restaurant and the few good meals I have had kept me coming back. The atmosphere is so uncomfortable! Why are you so rude to us? You are rude to your staff as well. We have menus thrown in our faces and no smile. Some of your wait staff is friendly except when you are giving them nasty looks then they feel uncomfortable. Good customer service is critical! Why dont you wise up? Users/ashleyinthemist
## well I think you are a racist despicable ASS hole Users/Sherri
