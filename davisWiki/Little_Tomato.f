The Little Tomato is a nick name for the Peoples Republic of Davis in the fashion of New York city being the Big Apple, New Orleans being the Big Easy, or Chicago being the Windy City. The phrase was coined by Rob Roy during his 2008 City Council Election 2008 bid for City Council. During the election Rob wrote a song called The Little Tomato which he performed in the crowd at Celebrate Davis 2008 Celebrate Davis as well as on stage at the Whole Earth Festival 2008 Whole Earth Festival. The song can be streamed and/or downloaded http://soundcloud.com/robroy/littletomato here.

In 2010, much like he Davis Wiki Dot Org Slash Music did for the Davis Wiki Wacky Woo 1 2006 Davis Wiki Fundraiser, Rob created a mix CD for the Local Wiki fundraiser entitled Audioversity in the Little Tomato: 6 Decades of Music Associated with Davis, Ca.

Fittingly, Sacramento has been referred to as the http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/summary15/ Big Tomato.
