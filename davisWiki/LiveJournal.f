About LiveJournal

Livejournal.com (LJ, pronounced eljay, spelled eljay by those who are ludicrous) is the amazing journaling site that many UC Davis students waste their time on.  It has been around since 1999.  For a while, the site had growthslowing measures in place: access was granted if you knew someone with an invite code. But lo! the admins saw fit to open the site up to everyone again. Ljers can update via an html page or through one of the many convenient http://www.livejournal.com/download/ eljay clients.

LiveJournal was started by a college student named http://brad.livejournal.com Brad Fitzpatrick.  In early 2005, Fitzpatrick sold LiveJournal (the project he proudly calls his baby) to blogging company http://sixapart.com Six Apart, which also owns Movable Type, Typepad, and the newly launched Vox.  That same year, LiveJournal hit a population of 8 million users with 2 million active journals.

 Communities 
Livejournal communities act like message boards for various interests. There are a number of Davis oriented LJ communities, with the UC Davis one being the most popular.

UC Davis Community
The http://www.livejournal.com/~ucdavis UC Davis LJ community has gained notoriety amongst UC LJ communities and has appeared on http://www.ljdrama.org ljdrama.org  The climate of the community changes drastically each minute and can have as many as 42 posts in a day.  Some consider it a very informative and social group, although also very caustic to certain types of posts and comments.

The UC Davis LJ community was http://www.livejournal.com/community/ucdavis/352.html started in Feburary of 2002 by Users/JoeConte Joe Conte when he was a junior at UC Davis. Some curmudgeons point to the UCD LJ community as a prime example of http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/SturgeonsLaw.html Sturgeons Law.

A noteable injoke on the UCD LJ is ending a post with the word Discuss.
   This has been a joke in various spoofs dating back to at least the 50s and possibly earlier.  It lampoons the lazy way to write tests that some instructors take (What is 3 +7?  Discuss.).

The UCD LJ is notorious for being unmoderated, despite the fact there are several moderators.  On 20020522 LJ user charlatan posted a photo of his penis to the community, which caused much http://community.livejournal.com/ucdavis/78878.html discussion and debate about the lack of community moderation.  The penis photo is said to have been used in the 2002 The California Aggie/Spoof Edition California Aggie Spoof Edition, but it is hard to verify as the original photograph is now gone.

Another notable nude moment was May 26, 2006, when someone posted http://community.livejournal.com/ucdavis/3130960.html#cutid1 photos of a couple having sex (photo was later replaced with a picture of a rabbit, then the entry deleted) with a WoW mask covering the face of the gal and a copy of the General Catalog covering the face of the guy.

Davisites Community
More oriented toward the town itself, the http://www.livejournal.com/~davisites Davisites LJ Community is much lower traffic and tends to have less noise posts than the UC Davis community.  It is home to both Undergraduate students students and townies.  Historically active, it has stagnated to an almost standstill in 2005.

Davis Swap Meet Community
Fairly active, the http://www.livejournal.com/~davis_swap_meet Davis Swap Meet Community is devoted to buying and selling items locally.

Davis Events Community
The http://www.livejournal.com/~davisevents Davis Events feed is tied to the DavisWiki and publishes all of the Events events listed on the Wiki.  If you have a LiveJournal, you can Events Board Syndication subscribe to the Events Board and get updates on your friends page!

 Blogs 
Quite a few weblogs are kept on Livejournal.  A majority are just meant to interact with friends, but a few blogs maintained by UCD students are meant for the whole blogosphere.  EMOSNAIL is prominent among these, both as an ASUCD political blog and for entertainment value.
