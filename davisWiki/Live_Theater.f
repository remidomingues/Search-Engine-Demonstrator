 Beyond Davis 
The Sacramento region, including Davis, has a good theater community at all levels and price ranges.  You dont have to go to http://www.theatrebayarea.org/ theater in the bay area to see http://www.shnsf.com/ Broadway level productions, even though they sometimes have http://www.theatrebayarea.org/tix/index.jsp reasonable prices .   Within a short drive is anything not already offered in Davis.

There is a thorough http://www.seeaplay.com calendar of Sacramento Theaters  productions.

Conveniently, and affordably, in downtown Woodland, is the http://www.wohtheatre.org/ Woodland Opera House .  WOH is a state park that puts on concerts, family and regular plays and musicals, in a lovely building.

Sacramento has (verify?) four professional theater organizations, several quality community theater groups, and a few dinner theater, youth theater and so on.  Look at the websites to get a feel for what grade of acting to expect (but dont shortchange the community groups, not only are they affordable, some of them are excellent).
