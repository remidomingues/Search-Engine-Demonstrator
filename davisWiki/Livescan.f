Livescan is a method of taking fingerprints using some specialized electronics hardware. No ink, no smudged prints, instant digitization... sure makes life easier for LEOs (and big brother!). In Davis, you may require a Livescan background check if you take part in certain programs (like the Citizens police academy or various primary/secondary teaching internships) or apply for http://www.hr.ucdavis.edu/Emp/Background certain jobs. You can also get a livescan against your will should you run into trouble with the law. When they take your prints for a background check, theyll send them off to the California Department of Justice and/or the FBI and scan them against their databases. If there are no matches and your fingerprints arent otherwise required, they are destroyed.

Places you can get livescanned:

  UC Davis Police Department
  Parcel Dispatch PDQ
  Davis Police Department
  Yolo County Sheriff  Coroner Yolo County Sheriffs Department
