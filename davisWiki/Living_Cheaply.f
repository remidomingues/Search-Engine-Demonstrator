 Banking 

   Ditch Banks with monthly fees that drain your accounts. Open up a free checking account at a Credit Unions Credit Union. The credit unions in Davis offer free checking accounts with no monthly fees. You can save a lot of money in the long run. For example, if your bank charges you a $10 monthly checking account fee, this can add up to $120 a year. A free checking account from a notforprofit credit union will save you money and you can even get free check orders (normally costs about $15$35).
   If you use a lot of ATMs and are tired of ATM fees, you can sign up with a bank or credit union that offers ATMs ATM fee refunds. First Northern Bank will refund ATM fees from other banks ATMs if you provide your receipts to the bank within 60 days. USAA(United Services Automobile Association), which formerly had an office in Sacramento, is an online insurance and banking company that offers ATM fee rebates (Up to $15 in ATM fees refunded per month). USAA checking and savings accounts are open to military members, former military, and people who are related to military members. Deposits are done by mail and some members are eligible for deposit via mobile phones and through some UPS stores. You might want to go with a local credit union or bank for easier ways to deposit money. They dont have any bank branches in California.
  If you want cash but you dont like ATM fees, you can use your ATM/Debit Card for cash back at the register. Drug stores and grocery stores offer this feature. You can enter your PIN and get cash back. Usually, this is free of charge.
   If your credit card has an annual fee or a high interest rate, you can shop around and see if a credit union offers credit cards without annual fees. Also many credit unions offer credit cards with better interest rates than banks and credit unions usually offer better loan rates than banks due to their notforprofit statuses. This can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars on home loans or car loans.
   Credit Unions often offer better rates on car loans and home loans. You can save a tremendous amount of money by getting loans from a credit union versus a forprofit bank.
   Golden 1 Credit Union offers a free box of checks with a free student checking account.
   Travis Credit Union, USE Credit Union, and Yolo Federal Credit Union also offer a free checking accounts.

  Discount stores such as Target, etc. feature a small list of $4 and $10 medications. Some basic medicines are available at those prices. Not all medicines are on that cheap list. There are some medicines that are more expensive. You can print out a list and give it to your doctor.
  AAA AAA Discount AAA offers discounts at local businesses such as Rite Aid and CVS CVS/Pharmacy for prescriptions; check the AAA page for a list of local participating businesses.
  Costco offers many prescription drugs at lower prices than at other pharmacies. Nonmembers can use the pharmacy. However, they only accept cash or debit.
  Many drug stores and supermarkets offer store brand versions of medications such as Tylenol. The generic store brand is listed under Acetaminophen. You can save several dollars just by choosing the store brand. The store brand medications contain the same active ingredients and are just as safe and effective. Big corporations advertise Tylenol and other brand names such as Claritin to try to fool people into spending the extra money for the brand name, when the store brand generic equivalent contains the same active ingredients. Dont fall for the advertising. Save money by going with whatever is cheapest.
  Kaiser Permanente The Kaiser pharmacy sells a variety of over the counter products at prices lower than at drug stores. You can save a great deal of money by buying your over the counter medications at the pharmacy. For example, generic Claritin is only $9.95 for 100 tablets. They also have Allegra and generic Zyrtec at steep discounts. The generic Tylenol is only $4.95 for 100 caplets. NonKaiser members have been able to purchase these products without having to show a Kaiser card.

 Internet 
  The price you pay for Internet access is always negotiable.  Call your Internet Service Provider every so often and tell them youre thinking about switching to someone else.  Ask them if they can make it worth your while to stay and they can almost always come up with a deal.  Also works for cable, phone service, credit cards and insurance.  Remember, it never hurts to ask.

 Out of town destinations for cheap(er) things 
 Electronics / Computer Parts 
   Frys Electronics (Sacramento) They will match any competitors prices including internet prices.
   HFE Electronics (Sacramento)
   Surplus Stuff (Sacramento)

 General BigBox 
  WalMart (Dixon, Woodland, West Sacramento, Sacramento)

 Warehouse Stores

   Sams Club (Sacramento and Vacaville) Owned by Walmart.

 Grocery Stores 
   Food 4 Less (Woodland)
   Grocery Outlet (Woodland and Davis)
   WalMart (Dixon)
   Winco (Vacaville) Be careful about cheap groceries. Often when you see low prices you buy more. You could fill up your shopping cart and it could end up being over a hundred dollars. Buy only what you need to survive. Stick to a grocery list.

 Outlet Malls 
   Napa Outlets
   Vacaville Outlets  Please note, that outlet stores often sell goods that are specially made for Outlet stores. These could be lower quality products or slightly defective merchandise that did not meet standards for the regular department stores.

 Tech/Professional Schools

   http://scc.losrios.edu/cosmoserv.html Sacramento City College  Haircuts and salon care (various prices)

 Taxes 
  The IRS website lists various vendors that offer free tax filing with a free efile. Efile allows you to submit your tax return electronically and you do not have to mail anything. http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id118986,00.html link You can file a Federal tax return for free. Just choose a vendor. Some examples are TaxAct, TurboTax, and H&R Block At Home. State tax returns are not free from these companies.

However, you can visit Californias state tax website and file your State Tax return for free using CalFile. CalFile allows you to file your state tax return electronically and you do not have to mail anything. http://www.ftb.ca.gov/index.shtml?disabledtrue link You can get a free federal tax return from the companies above and then file for free from the State of California. In this way, you can do your both of your tax returns for free as long as you qualify for a free CalFile. CalFile allows you to efile online and it is much faster than a traditional mailed tax return.

The advantage to online free efile from these companies is that it is fast and convenient since it is online.

 Volunteering 
Volunteer Opportunities Volunteering can help you feel like you are giving back to the community. On top of that some events can get you free admission to a lot of fun/interesting events in Sacramento, typically food, and occasionally a free TShirt. The only drawback is you may need a car to get to the event since it is not in Davis.

Do not volunteer if you dont believe in the cause. You are there to help them, and being opposed to what they do is not going to help anyone. Do consider your own values when volunteering.

The following list are events that can net you some pretty sweet things for the cash strapped student.
  Free California State Fair Tickets and Parking.  Contact the http://www.sacramentocvb.org/ Sacramento Visitors and Convention Bureau and ask about volunteering at various events. You work a few hours and then get into the events for free. They have events throughout the year, and always need volunteers. Do it often enough, they may start calling you. It is a Sacramento centered organization, but they take everyone so fear not about your non Sacramento residence status.
  http://www.sacjazz.com/ Sacramento Jazz Jubilee is held every year over Memorial Day Weekend in May. Volunteering for them nets you an all weekend pass (a $90+ value) plus other goodies.
  http://www.makeawishsacto.org/ Make a Wish Foundation of Sacramento has fundraising events throughout the year and treats their volunteers pretty well. Alpha Phi Omega volunteered at an event last May and they were given several flats of leftover sandwiches to take home with them after the event.
    Users/RogerClarks wife is their volunteer coordinator, so he would be remiss in not including them.
  http://www.infineonraceway.com/ Infineon Raceway at Sears Point is a killer place to go watch the races, but tickets can be steep for the college student. Volunteers get in to them for free. If you cant do it directly with them, they may point you to charity groups that work it as a fundraiser and need volunteers.
  There are a lot of other events throughout Davis that need volunteers. It may not net you much in terms of goodies, but you can be working at killer locations at events and have a better view that most other people.

20041121 11:48:15 nbsp Somehow, I feel something is wrong with the idea behind this page. If you want to live cheap, dont buy as much. Every single thing on the page though is about spending money. Maybe, Ill link to parks and games and stuff when I have time.  Users/JackHaskel

20041121 12:18:23 nbsp I like that idea.  Also, though, sometimes you really do need to buy food, clothes, etc, and places like Costco are usually cheaper.  Shopping wiser overall  spending less, buying less  is a better idea, for sure.  Maybe we could have some links to like inexpensive foods and inexpensive recipes?    Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041121 12:21:19 nbsp Or maybe more of a guide to spending less while in Davis would be useful  maybe it should go here and then from here we link to this place (maybe named Buying stuff for less or something)  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041124 18:55:24 nbsp The falacy at work here is that people who buy things from Costco buy stuff they dont need.  I think that may be true of most Costco shoppers, but many of us Davisites prefer Costco because they sell larger sizes and therefore less packaging per oz of product (i.e., better for the environment)and AT A LOWER COST.  The Costco parking lot is filled with Davis vehicles, so obviously the soccer moms know about this place.  Too bad theres fuel involved, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  I dont know if anyone has ever figured out how much money you can save by buying necessities outside Davis, but Im fairly certainly you can stretch a dollar twice as far.  Heres the sad thing, most of the stores in Davis sell useless, overpriced TRINKETSwhich is where most of the anticostco people think we should be shopping instead.  I wonder if the Davis city counsel realized that Cost Plus may eventually drive all those tricket dealers out of business.  I also love the coop, but I think they have become somewhat lazy in trying to get their members the best deals, because people are willing to buy products with a very high base cost (despite their professedly low markup), while you can get the same products for much less elsewhere.  Take for example Toms of Maine products, way too pricey.  Bottom line, at Costco, I can get a 5 pound bag of tortilla chips for $3, I can get 16 eggs for $1, and they have a modest selection of organic veggies for WAY less.  But hey, I suppose if you want to avoid buying things, you could always make your own soap.  Fight club, anyone?   Users/JaimeRaba

20041202 10:10:05 nbsp Costco can be cheap for large groups of people trying to live cheaply together.  An apartment of 6 guys can get a whole lot of paper towels, soda, laundry detergent, etc, for much cheaper.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20041212 18:59:36 nbsp I added the big box stores walmart and target. Both are generally good with prices, however I find both carry lowerquality items (you get what you pay for). Best to buy things from these stores where they cant really mess up the quality (packaged foods, etc).  Users/JamesDawe

20050201 21:03:01 nbsp I hear tell the target in woodland is packing up shop. Does anyone have an ETA on this? Users/ArlenAbraham

20050202 11:20:04 nbsp I heard the target in woodland is closing when the new target in davis opens in 2006 Users/MyaBrn

20050204 16:24:21 nbsp For those of you are serious about saving money and living cheaply, redeeming recycled goods and dumpster diving should be looked into.  Users/ErnBro

20050209 17:44:44 nbsp So here is a challenge/question for yall. I have a bunch of friends coming in from out of town for a thing, and they are big Sake drinkers. They appreciate good Sake when they are sober, but once they are drunk any Sake will do. So... with that in mind, does anybody know where I can find a lot of Sake around here, for not a lot of cash? Users/EricKlein

20050210 08:48:07 nbsp RE Sake: Try Kims Mart... they probably have the large size bottles of drinking sake. Dont make the mistake of trying to drink cooking sake, as I once did. Yuk! Anyway, if Kims doesnt have the large bottles of drink and you have a vehicle, Sac has a large Asian market on Broadway near 10th by the motorcycle club that definitely has a good selection of the big bottles. Users/AlphaDog

20050210 08:54:35 nbsp Nugget often, but not always, has good sales on Sake.  Users/JackHaskel im hungry, why must nutella be so damn expensive...i could live off that stuff

20051017 02:19:15 nbsp I have to say for all the people who put down places like Walmart and Sams Club obviously do not shop for themselves and think that money must grow on trees. Also for all those people who oppose a SuperWalmart are idiots. If u rather spend up to and close to $70.00 for like 20 items at Safeway, be my guest. But here is some advice find a friend with a car and go shopping at places like Costco or Sams Club and see how much money you have left over in the month to pay for other things. I also stress shopping at places like Food 4 Less or the Grocery Outlet in Woodland. Food 4 Less happens to be aligned with Nugget Markets, so I highly doubt the food quality is any different. But for those who have a level of skepticism that borders on stupidity keep on shopping at those expensive places. Users/MikeMele
  Costco can save you plenty of money if you shop wisely, refrain from buying items youre gonna wind up throwing out, and care about good quality products. Lots of their products are equivalent to sale items at supermarkets, but there are certain key items that save tons of money without needing to wait for a sale. Salad Greens, batteries, Olive Oil, cheese, toiletries, soda, baking goods, alcohol, aluminum foil, and spices are all cheaper there than at Walmart. Plus, you dont have to worry about items expiring in two days like when you shop at Grocery Outlet.

20070104 18:44:31 nbsp Winco in Vacaville has a bulk food section (unlike Food4Less) and they are better quality than Grocery Outlet. Check out www.winco.com Users/LinaPlanuty

20071213 12:03:50 nbsp There should be an entertainment section as well. You can rent movies for free at the public Library. Users/MyaBrn
