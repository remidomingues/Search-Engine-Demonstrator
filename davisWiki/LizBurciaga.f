I am  a 5th year English/Theatre major.
I worked at Unitrans for 3 years as a conductor. 050. I worked in the UC Davis main bookstore for one summer 08. I used to work at Uncle Vitos Slice of New York.
I will be graduating in June.
I can be seen sometimes at an occasional karaoke night. I love singing, but am by no means as good at attending karaoke nights around Davis as some people.
I am a costume queen, you may have seen me once and most likely never recognized me outside of costume.
I am great at beer pong. I might correct your grammar. I play video games. I did ballet. I like a good baseball game.
I care a lot about people. I may be a little too nice at times, but I wont let myself get walked all over.
I have fleeting hobbies, but I usually come back to them all.
I dont like to plan. My favorite day of the week is Friday.
I have a crazy mother and an extremely sweet father. I own 3 dogs that live in LA whom I miss terribly.
I have a million quirks, but I think Im fun to be around.
