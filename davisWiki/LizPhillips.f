20070911 13:33:07 nbsp Thank you so much for identifying Bahai Grove those trees.  I have asked dozens of people about them (or that type), and nobody could give me a name. I grew up in a place where Cypress are wiki:wikipedia:Taxodium distichum entirely different looking, live in swamps and wiki:wikipedia:Cypress knee have knees.  It is odd to move around to places with different trees.  Thanks for the information. Users/JabberWokky

      Hey, glad to help! Theyre officially called wiki:wikipedia:Cupressus sempervirens Cupressus sempervirens, but certain members of my family insist on calling them Dr. Seuss Trees. I know what you mean about moving...Im from Massachusetts, where most of the plants here Just Wont Grow. liz
