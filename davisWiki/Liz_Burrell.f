Liz Burrell joined ASUCD in June of 2002 as a legislative intern for the State and National Affairs Office (SNAO).  After attending the annual University of California Student Association (UCSA) Congress in August 2002, Liz was nominated and confirmed to serve as UCSAs Vice Chair for Legislative Affairs.  Liz was responsible for pushing through the revival of SNAOs Lobby Corps program.  In February 2003, Liz was appointed and confirmed as Director of SNAO.  At the next UCSA Congress, she was nominated and confirmed as Chair of the Legislative Affairs Committee.  Liz took a year off from student government and returned in 2005 as the Director of State & National Affairs in the Office of External Affairs.

From 20022004, Liz served in a Student Focus Administration, with the first year under Anthony Volkar, Director of SNAO, and the second year running the office herself.  From 20052006, she served under James Schwab of the L.E.A.D. slate.

Liz, along with several other incredibly smart individuals, successfully lobbied for the discontinuation of ASUCD funds going to support UCSA.
