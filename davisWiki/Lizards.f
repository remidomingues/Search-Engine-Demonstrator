Lizards are fairly common tiny reptilian guys who zip around and enjoy the sun more than wiki:wikipedia:George Hamilton (actor) George Hamilton (or, if youre younger, wiki:wikipedia:Snookie).  If you believe the wiki, the only local lizards are Western Fence Lizards, aka Blue Bellied Lizards.  If you dont believe that, figure out what other ones are around and add them to the wiki!

Oh, there are also the Lounge Lizards, but they arent quite the same thing.
