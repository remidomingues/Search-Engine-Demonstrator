I grew up in the Woodland/Davis area, and moved to Santa Barbara for a brief while, and then returned to Davis for another year to work at Osaka Sushi (G Streetfor 10 months), Caffe Italia (briefly), and the B Street Theatre (Sacramento, CA).  Im now residing in Oakland, CA, and going to city college.

Davis will always hold a big fat special place in my heart.
