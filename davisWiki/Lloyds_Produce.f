20080112 09:23:10 nbsp actually someone put up this picture and other information without telling me or without asking me what I or without knowing that cherry belle is a name for a radish and not a potato, so read between the lines. I was not too pleased to see my phone number and address on the web but no one has ever called me and I do not live at that address but still i am a little uneasy that it has been posted and I will try to remove it except that i am a computer idiot and at this point I do not know how Users/lloydjohnson

20080112 09:58:09 nbsp Welcome to the wiki, Lloyd! You might want to take a look at Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner to get a better idea of how DavisWiki functions. The person who originally created the page almost certainly did it with the intention of providing more information about a Farmers Market vendor they found interesting. Ive removed the address, phone number, and picture. If your contact information is personal, not business, there is no reason to have it on this page. Personally, I think the picture is wonderful and would love your permission to repost it, but thats your choice.  Users/JessicaLuedtke
