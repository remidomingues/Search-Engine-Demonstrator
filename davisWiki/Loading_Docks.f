On the UC Davis campus, most buildings have a Loading Dock that accepts shipments and expels shipments. For some reason, people dump old things they no longer want on these docks, often getting in the way of loading and unloading things. Any items on docks are still university property; University policy governs the disposal of surplus items and the legal way to obtain any of them is to go to Bargain Barn. Anything with a UC Davis Property Tags property tag will likely be missed. In spite of this many longtime Davis residents use Loading Docks for Dumpster Diving or finding useful things that are being discarded. Most loading docks are most wellstocked on Wednesdays can someone verify?

 Things regularly discarded at Loading Docks 
  Electron Scanning Microscopes (sometimes)
  Bookcases
  Desks
  Chairs
  Desktop accoutrements
  Computers, Monitors, Printers (may not work)but some are museum pieces
  Glassware
  Miscellaneous plastic and metal deviceconstruction materials.

 Tips 
Be careful of your own safety including watching out for hazardous materials like broken glass or toxic chemicals.
Bring a car or biketrailer if you expect to take anything.
