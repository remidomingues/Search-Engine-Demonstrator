This page is written with a Davisspecific slant.  For general information, see http://localwiki.org LocalWiki.org.

The LocalWiki project is an ambitious effort to help other local communities create information hubs as fantastic as the Davis Wiki.  Right now, the project has two main components: new software, designed from the ground up for local community usage; and a focused stewardship of individual pilot communities.

When will Davis Wiki be running the new software?

While developing software is a major initial aspect of the project, our aim isnt to simply upgrade the Davis Wiki.  At first, we have to focus our attention on the initial pilot communities.  Davis Wiki is really successful, but people need to see radical successes elsewhere to help spread collaborative local media.  Davis Wiki is also quite mature, and if we aimed to immediately support everything on the Davis Wiki or immediately port over Davis Wiki to the new software we would lose focus that would be better spent on the initial pilot communities.

So the plan is to work with one or two pilot communities until theyre in a good place.  At that point, well step back a bit and figure out what functionality and features should be running on the Davis Wiki.  Weve been building everything to be extremely flexible, softwarewise, so if theres functionality we develop for one community that isnt needed or wanted in Davis we can turn it off or alter it.  Well also be able to add new features based on feedback from Davisites who are currently using and editing the Davis Wiki.  Its also worth noting that our current grant funding is explicitly for new/pilot communities, so this is another reason why our initial focus is on new places.  In a nutshell: we have limited resources and insane ambitions.

How can I help?

Up until last week weve been 100% focused on writing new software.  If youre a programmer and want to help out, please do!  Everything is entirely open  http://code.trac.localwiki.org/ information on all that is here.  Were going to be doing a big open source outreach push in the next month  and hopefully hold a few hackathons in Davis and SF.

Were now shifting gears a bit as we figure out the first set of pilot communities.  More on that in a week or so.

More later, post questions here and I will answer.  You can also shoot me an email at philipn@gmail.com. Users/PhilipNeustrom

Whats the plan as far as migrating Davis Wiki to the new software? Users/TomGarberson

   I was thinking we could have a nerd hackathon in Davis (on the http://daviswiki.org_Board#head20521 events board here) to work through some Davisspecific software issues.  Hoping we can get a demo site running sometime shortly before then so folks can poke around and we can figure out what we like, what we need and what we need to change.  Im also thinking itd be good to migrate over Sacramento first as its less active but also familiar enough to Davis folks that we can get a feel for things first.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

    What about nonnerds or those who cant make the meeting  is there a way for them to give input too?   Users/CovertProfessor

       Yes!  Well have a bigger, nearby wiki migrated (like Sacramento) very soon and the demo DavisWiki site up for that exact reason.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

        Looking forward to giving it a spin on Sacramento.  Would it be worth doing a brainstorm prior to the hackathon to work out exactly what kind of Davisspecific software issues need to be addressed?  Thatd also let those of us who arent as softwaresavvy (nerdy or not) help out, as well. tg

           Or maybe a group editing / playaround with the new stuff once the demo sites up?   What do you think would work best?   In terms of Davisspecific, theres two types of things Im thinking: 1) Stuff that holds up a migration 2) Things folks want, or want changed, within attackrange.  #1 includes, off the top of my head, the comments functionality (which Ryan in Rochester has been working on, but we would need to discuss here as its been a controversial topic), the events board, footnotes and just general solidness of the whole shebang.  #2 includes, well, anything :)  But things like how should user notification work? / anything that that might be specific to needs here.   Users/PhilipNeustrom
            Yeah, #2 are the sort of things where itd be worth getting a community conversation going to figure out what needs doing prior to the hackathon.  I doubt well get anything resembling consensus on how to handle comments, but notifications are the perfect example of something that could use brainstorming. Users/TomGarberson

Hi all...I created this page to discuss the migration (when / if) to the local wiki software.

I just checked out the https://dentonwiki.org DentonWiki, which looks amazing. Anybody have any news on this?

Thanks â€”aroach12

   Were migrating over smaller sites first (https://sacwiki.org SacWiki.org is the first nearby one).  Being so close to Davis, were hoping the SacWiki can be a good way to get some feedback.  Well be making a big SacWiki launch soon and hopefully get a bunch of great feedback then.  Theres two relatively small software blockers, as explained a bit above: implement an Events Board and figure out what we want to do with the Comments macro/functionality.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

     Thanks for the update. Users/aroach12
