Many people think that one of the best ways to eat sustainability sustainably is to eat local food; the term locavores has been coined to describe people who eat all or most of their food from local sources.  Eating locally means less fossil fuel burned to get the food to you  as an added bonus, it also supports your local economy.  If youre industrious, you can obtain and prepare local food from the Davis Farmers Market, from Fruit and Vegetable Stands, from a CSA box, from the Meat Lab, or by reading carefully the signs at grocery stores such as the Davis Food Coop. Or you can gardening grow it yourself!  (It doesnt get much more local that that).

For those that are less industrious, here are some restaurants that emphasize local food:

  Farmers Kitchen Cafe
  Emighs Market in Dixon has lamb and beef from Rio Vista (sandwiches too!)
  Monticello
  Mustard Seed
  Seasons
  Tucos
  Cuarto Dining Commons
