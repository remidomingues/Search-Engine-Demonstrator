The Local Produce Link (LPL) is a project of the Healthy Eating Active Living Collaborative of the Health Education Council in Sacramento and is made possible by a grant from The California Nutrition Network. LPL was started in July, 2005 by Users/RainbowVogt Rainbow Vogt and Users/PatrickProctor Patrick Proctor. The goal of LPL is to connect schools with nearby farms, from which fresh fruits and vegetables can be bought. This connection creates direct marketing opportunities for Californias organic and farmers market growers. As the most agriculturally rich state in the nation, LPL wants Californias students to reap all of the benefits that farm fresh food has to offer.
