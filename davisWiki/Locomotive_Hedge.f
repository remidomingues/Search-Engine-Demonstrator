The locomotive hedge is parked on G Street right next to The Davis Enterprise corporate office (which is next to Jack in the Box).  

Youd probably never see this Topiaries Topiary unless it was pointed out to you, because when you walk by it looks like a normal hedge (headon, that is).  But from the side...


It jumps out!  A freaking train, sitting right there on G Street!

Note as of December 1, 2004: the hedge seems to have been pretty much destroyed theres not enough bushes left to form a train any more. Bummer. 

Spring 2005 had the locomotive back and chugging along.
