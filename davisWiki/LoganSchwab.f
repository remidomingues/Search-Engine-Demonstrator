20140401 12:56:10 nbsp Thanks! All those are from Putah Mikey.  The winter was slow but the prespawn and spawn have been killer on warm days without the rain. Still can pull the bass in the rain but its a lot more work for a lot less fish. I dont like to say exactly what I use on here bc I dont want just random ppl to look up fishing in Davis and figure it out so easily and ruin the amazing fishery that Putah has been for me haha.
But if you want to go fish sometime Id be happy to show you some stuff.  Im sure you could teach me a few things about stonegate. Ive never targeted bass there only the carp and catfish. Id love to get on the bass action there.  Users/LoganSchwab

20140405 19:05:52 nbsp Hey guys new to Davis, and have been wanting to fish. I checked out Putah creek near old Davis road with my roommate and didnt catch anything. You guys know how the fishing is there this time of year? and any advice? i tried fishing a jig very slowly today and nothing :/ Users/MarioLira

20140406 23:44:35 nbsp Fishing is great this time of year.  A jig should work pretty well
Got to fish it shallow up against the bank for the most part.  Users/LoganSchwab
