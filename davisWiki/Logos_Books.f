Logos Books is a notforprofit second hand bookstores bookstore located in downtown Davis. All profits from the store go to support the charities Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders. Prior to opening as a brickandmortar store in 2010, they operated as a small internet business. Since 2000, they have contributed over $45,000 to these two charities as an online book business.

20100226 16:23:14 nbsp My two boys and I stopped here to shop on the second day of business for Logos Books, and we really loved the place. Susan and Peter introduced themselves to us, and they were really friendly and helpful. We picked out a book each, and found them to be reasonably priced. I saw plenty of poetry, and room in the front of the store for a small reading! Davis deserves more used bookstores, so I am pleased that Logos has joined us on 2nd Street. Users/DrandyJones

20100313 11:01:20 nbsp I saw this place a couple of weeks ago and got really excited that theres a used bookstore in town now! I parked the car and walked straight in to check it out... but I didnt make it very far. The owner was sitting at the counter near the back of the store and stared at me as I entered. I smiled and continued in, but he kept staring at me until I finally realized he had something to say to me he wanted me to leave my purse next to the door (and unattended it might have been less worrisome if he had offered to hold it behind the counter instead) before I looked at books. I was about to comply, then changed my mind and left, extremely insulted.

My purse is not huge sure I can fit a paperback in it, as I have before when I go someplace and want something to read but I am no thief; Ive never shoplifted anything in my life! To automatically imply to all women that they are thieves before they have even had a chance to enter the store is extremely insulting. I felt untrusted, judged and... well... insulted. To make matters worse, he wanted me to leave it next to the door on a little shelf where it would be unattended and any passerby might be able to simply pick it up and walk off with it.

If the shop owner changed their policy and allowed women to keep their personal items with them while they shop, then I might consider coming back here. But as it is, the owner is displaying a complete lack of trust and respect for the women (and men?) shoppers who carry purses/satchels. Personally, thats not an attitude which I feel comfortable supporting with my business. Users/StephanieStudebaker
  From my limited experience with that bookstore situation, theres a discount book store that I went to in Berkeley that was all set up for putting your books by the counter.  They probably didnt worry much about the hand bags, I guess.  A shopkeeper should especially refrain from insult with the small purse.  Without my showing respect as a night time cab driver in South Dallas, I could have been killed.  I at least greatly reduced my risk by being respectful. Users/BruceHansen

  That is a bit strange considering I was in there a few weeks ago and had my large carrier bag on me as I perused books. They didnt say anything to me about it, though I did get the awkward vibe. If only they had music or something playing to cut the tension. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100521 12:19:28 nbsp Ive purchased a handful of books here for very cheap.  Novels are usually two to four dollars and are at least acceptable condition, and frequently are quite good.  Logos features a fairly amazing selection of foreign language fiction (French!  German!  Spanish!).  The atmosphere is a bit dry (though Ive never been asked to check my bag) and it is difficult to sell a book to them, but I usually stop in and poke around in here when Im downtown. Users/bjahern

20110128 13:44:05 nbsp Logos is a small bookstore but they have a very interesting selection of books. They often seem to have more varied and offbeat books than the larger bookstores in town. And they have always been polite and friendly when I have stopped in; I think Ive even been in with a bookbag without being asked about it or stared at. It is worth stopping by the store if you are in the vicinity. Users/ToNils

20110220 21:49:03 nbsp They were open and celebrating their 1 year anniversary today.  It was the first time Ive been in here and it is a pretty neat bookshop.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20110420 16:13:02 nbsp My favorite place in davis, hands down. They have a ton of rare editions of  classic literature that are surprisingly inexpensive.  Users/nqbui89
