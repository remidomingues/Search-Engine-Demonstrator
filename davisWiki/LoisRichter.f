Davis Garden Show is also archived online (mp3 files) and podcast.  See http://DavisGardenShow.com DavisGardenShow.com for details.

 DCTV (cable channel 15) series: Thoughtfulness (formerly Sundays at 5:00pm).  Started in the 1990s, this show was to TV what Lois current show is to radio  an eclectic mix of topics  with the addition of lots of visual plays and activities.  Sometimes new live shows were created weekly, often they were on a biweekly or monthly shooting schedule.  Recently its been very erratic, and is no longer scheduled as a weekly event.

 A subseries on DCTV was Gardening West of the Causeway featuring Don Shor  similar to the Davis Garden Show radio program, but with pictures and real plants instead of phone calls.  Each month there was at least one seasonrelated gardening show offered.

Personality?:  Image(ATCKatieSketch#03.jpg, right, 300, thumbnail, Katie in my lap!)
 Usually outgoing, occasionally reclusive.  Very friendly.  Often offers to help in groups and participates fully in meetings.  Speaks to strangers and is easily distracted by birds, flowers, kittens, etcetera.   Likes to know what the rules are before the game begins.  Lois has a passion for learning new things and for sharing what she knows.  Always an editor, Lois likes to learn about something and then create a clear presentation to pass that knowledge along.

 Strengths: Bright, intense, easily enthused, able to analyse problems and devise solutions, very good with words.  A good editor, able to focus and clarify. (Better at doing things NOW than at remembering to contact others later.)
 Weaknesses: Makes puns and word plays.  Underexercised.  Frequently gets caught up in the moment and loses track of time; needs to use her calendar a lot!  Occasionally forgets to go somewhere or is late.  Inertia causes her to not go out much unless shes keeping a formal commitment  or is picked up by someone.  Perhaps says Yes too much.

Personal History:
 Originally surprised at being asked to teach, Lois eventually took on that role in many arenas  leading classes for the Mother.com ISP, the MacNexus users group, and Davis Community Network; teaching thru DJUSD DJUSDs Davis Adult School, City of Davis Senior Center, and UCDs Craft Center; and doing private work as a onetoone tutor and a smallgroup corporate instructor.  As a coleader of the http://www.dcn.org/iug/ Internet Users Group (IUG), Lois occasionally gives topical presentations.

 Lois leads tours as a Docent for the Arboretum at UCDavis and a volunteer for the Yolo Audubon Society.  She and her husband (Jim Drummond) planned to run a birdingconnection business after he retired  hence their domain name http://gotouring.com GoTouring.com!

Current Passion: ATCs

 ATCs  Artist Trading Cards (aka Art Cards)  21/2 x 31/2 works of art which are created by one person and exchange with another ATCmaker.  These little treasures are never sold, only traded (or gifted).  Lois worked for six months on the firstever public ATC Exchange in our region  (22 Sept. 2006).  It was preceded by three ATC classes in August, a workshop in early September, a Davis Enterprise article, and lots of flyers and announcements.  More than 20 people came to the Exchange  most with at least a few cards to trade  and there was enough interest in an ongoing ATC group that two more 2006 swaps were planned and a new club was formed early in 2009.  Call Lois for more info about the ATC Exchange Club of Northern California.

Presentations, Teaching, Etc.: Upcoming Events
Being a docent for the Arboretum for about 20 years, I annually lead 26 tours.  Different years, different topics.  In January 2009, I did a presentation (slideshow, talk, and birdwalk) that drew the LARGEST group of participants Ive ever had!  The room was packed.  (And so many folks said they regretted missing it, that I did a similar presentation at the Senior Center in March.)

Asked to repeat this topic for 2010, I present Birds that Winter in the Arboretum  TWICE ... on October 17 and November 21.

For 2012, I scheduled Birds in Davis (a free slideshow & talk) BOTH at the Senior Center (Tuesday, 31 Jan) /and at Arb HQ Library (Sat., 4 Feb) with a birdwalk following the Saturday presentation.  (All events free and public.)  Then in 2013, I did another Arb presentation & birdwalk.

If you want info about my upcoming birding talks (or art workshops), please contact me by phone.

20100830 21:37:50 nbsp Hey Lois, thanks for all your work on the various bird pages!
... theres a feature you might find useful.  You can view changes to a page one by one in chronological order.  All you have to do is click on the Info button at the top of a page, select two of the edits (potentially the first two, versions 1 and 2), and hit the Compare button.  Thatll bring up a page showing you the first edit made to the page after it was created, along with the date of the change and the editor who made it.  At the top of that page, youll find a next edit link whichll take you to Version 3 and show the second change, and so on.  Its a reasonably good way to track a conversation.

That said, its far from perfect.  The next version of wiki software, which is in development now, will significantly improve the ability to track and/or join discussions. Users/TomGarberson

As for whats better to do, well it really depends what youre doing.  If youre going to make a quick change like capitalize a letter, then Quick Edit is perfect.  If youre going to do some in depth work like rearranging and restructuring paragraphs, then youll probably want to do a proper edit.

For the other, it is definitely better to edit one page, save your changes and then edit another page, though with less used pages (like the birds pages) it probably wont make a difference.

Having a page open for editing does not prevent other people from editing it, just whoever saves 2nd (or 3rd, etc) has to check the edits of the other person and remove automatically added tags before they can save to prevent people either changing the exact same thing or overwriting someone elses changes by mistake.

You can also put comments in the bar under the edit window that will tell other people what changes you are making so they dont have to open the page and compare your edit to the old version to find out what has changed.  Users/MasonMurray
  Just to give you another perspective on this issue  since there are many ways of doing things, and no rules other than the ones that editors agree to  in my opinion, it is fine to edit a page a bit at a time, adding new content at each point, as you have been doing.  I think the please remember to preview issue comes in when people miscode and dont see it because they forgot to preview, so that rather than each edit adding new content, each edit is trying to do the same thing.   I think your edits have been great and I thank you for your contributions!! Users/CovertProfessor
