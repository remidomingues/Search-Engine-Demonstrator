London Fish n Chips was the name of a restaurant that served delicious fish and  you guessed it  chips.  But what you probably didnt guess is that they also had rice bowls and bento boxes. At the same location is now (2010) The Dumpling House which also serves Fish and Chips in addition to Asian dishes, and retains the London Fish n Chips sign above the door. Basically it seems they have changed from a Fish n Chips shop that also serves some Asian food, to an Asian shop that also serves Fish n Chips.

The fries are not Americanstyle thin crispy ones, but rather oilfried wedges of potato.  Mmmm... potato in boiling oil; a nutritional nightmare that is oh so tasty.  They also  serve up a variety of other savory deepfried food, all of which goes well with malt vinegar.  Other sauces include tartar, ketchup, and a thick red spicy sauce that claims to be cocktail sauce, but lacks the requisite horseradish and is therefore not cocktail sauce.

New to the restaurant in 2009 are rice bowls and bento boxes.  Rice bowls can be served with your choice of chicken, beef, or tofu (there are surely other options).  The bowls also include steamed carrots, broccoli, and teriyaki sauce drizzled rice.  As of July 2009, rice bowls cost exactly $5 when tax is included.  Bento boxes also have various options such as fried calamari steaks or prawns.  They include rice, slaw with ranch, steamed vegetables, and a fortune cookie.  Bento boxes cost $5.99 before tax.

The restaurant has been in operation for many years. Since 20060202, it has been owned by the same person as Davis Noodle City. They added sandwiches to the menu, but kept the same name as the previous owners and retained the focus on crispy fried goodness.


For many years, it was run by two Chinese women who seemed to enjoy frying things. It was taken over by a Chinese couple in spring 2005, who immediately introduced chicken strips (battered like fish, but with a fresh chicken taste.)  As of this writing, the fish is still delicious, and the portions just as generous. With the exception of these new items, the new owners have implemented a few changes to enhance your experience there. Notably, they now change the oil every day, so you no longer have to worry about lingering fish and deep fry oil odors. They still serve deepfried twinkies and snickers, but they are not on the menu.  The restaurant serves CocaCola products and allow free refills.

They tend not to ask whether you want a receipt or not, so for safetys sake, you should probably ask for one even if theyre not crowded.


The location became The Dumpling House on 20100125, though oddly the http://www.yolorecorder.org/recording/fictitious/lookup/index_html?uid17950079 Fictitious Business Name was renewed after this date.

20080225 22:31:41 nbsp I stopped in around dinner time. It was sad to see the place empty save two other customers, but the service was prompt, the portion sizes were good (if not a little large) and the fish was deepfried to perfection. The onepiece is a really good deal and plenty of food! Users/JessicaRuygt

20080225 22:33:45 nbsp I got the twopiece here one time and it was wayyy bigger than I thought it was going to be. It was good, just be prepared for large portions.  Users/JeremyOgul

20080317 01:36:34 nbsp Great place for a snack that just hits that greasy crispy craving. $4.30 after tax for one fried fish and fries. Lots of other combination options like getting 1 fish with prawns, clams, or calamari. They have sandwiches, onion rings, and other fried goods. Not bad, recommended. Users/CoreyPham

20080323 23:54:10 nbsp The first time we went there the place was completely empty but the food was good and service was quick. You get large pieces of tender fish that are fried nice and crispy (not soggy at all) along with a large amount of fries. I have also tried the calamari and it wasnâ€™t bad either. If you have a craving for deep fried food then this place is recommended.  Users/NtoWolves

20080413 02:51:02 nbsp Wow, this place was fantastic. Service, taste, and portions are great. I especially enjoyed the spicy, tangy sauce condiment with the fish. Fantastic dining experience. I will go again. Next time Im getting an order of fish&chips, a .99 milk tea, and a side of coleslaw. So delicious!!! Users/soohoo

20080428 07:55:04 nbsp Fish was yummy but the calamari was way over cooked and had the texture of hard rubber. Users/stevie13

20080531 12:10:25 nbsp Great atmosphere, nice owners/employees, and good food if youre in the mood for some grease.  If not, I think you can get the chicken sandwich unfried. Users/KernHaug

20080609 19:28:46 nbsp everything tastes pretty good, service is quick, but they dont give you a receipt unless you ask. Users/Noobster123

20080613 2:21:00 nbsp Im vegetarian, so I cant say Ive ever actually eaten the food here. The people seem very friendly though. A friend and I once asked the woman at the counter if she would deep fry a gum ball for us and she was happy to oblige, although she did request that if it made a mess and she had to change the oil in the fryer that we would be willing to pay a few dollars compensation. Users/EMS

20080619 14:44:01 nbsp I love the clam strips, and theyre pretty cheap, too. Users/JoePomidor

20080712 13:30:34 nbsp I like this place, but I think they should replace their cocktail sauceit seems a little off to me (last time I ate there was during the winter) Users/at86

20080721 18:51:51 nbsp I go there often because of the large size fish, for 3.99 + tax, its a great deal. I love the fries, fresh hot, friedtoorder food. The shrimps are kind of small, but if you order the calamari, they give you alot! I really enjoy this place, once a month whenever I crave fries Users/llee10789

20080722 20:12:00 nbsp So I finally went here despite my better judgement.  Dont get me wrong.  This place was pretty good...if you like fried food.  I thought I did, or at least I remember liking fried food.  But there in lied the problem.  I havent had fried food in so long, my body just did not like it.  I ordered the 1piece fish with a side of slaw and could only finish off half the fish, 2/3 of the fries (which were perfectly done), and half the slaw.  The slaw was perfectly crunchy, but was a bit too drippy for my taste (I tend to prefer a smoother sauce).  Allinall, it was tasty and such, but a while later, my body was having the wtf did you just feed me blues.  I get this way with burgers too...Im not sure why... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080803 16:54:19 nbsp They have pretty good calamari here.  Users/AvidSpots

20081001 16:21:17 nbsp My housemate and I decided to give this place a shot the other day, and lets say Ill be returning sometime soon.  When I first noticed the prices, I was a bit weary, so I decided to order the 2 piece, assuming the pieces would be a bit on the small side.  I was soon corrected after I recieved my food.  That deep fried snickers looks interesting, Ill need to give it a shot next time. Users/JimL

20081204 00:20:56 nbsp I went here the other day and the 3 fish tacos with fries were excellent.  I really liked the cozy atmosphere inside.  Cool art on the walls and folk/indy music playing in the background.  Maybe next time Ill try the calimari. Users/CharlesWinkelmann

20081209 22:36:55 nbsp me and my partner just hit it up right before it closed. The service was great, the food was good, the banter was also wonderful! The only thing that detracted from the experience was the smallish portions, but then again Im a 205 lb fat American, so dont trust me. Users/StevenDaubert
 Dude, Im fatter than you and I was overwhelmed by how much food I got when I split the 6 piece meal three ways with my roomies. wl

20090331 12:50:41 nbsp I called there to see about food for a conference and as soon as I introduced myself to the person on the phone, the man who picked up screamed were not interested in your business! and hung up.  I had never contacted them before about anything.  I found them to be rude.  I will not patronize them in any way and encourage others to do the same and take your business elsewhere clearly they do not value having customers enough to be courteous. Users/natah
 I, on the other hand, would assume that they mistook you to be a telemarketer, which justifies such a response. MattJurach

20090427 21:21:43 nbsp I thought it was a little peculiar that a LONDON fish n chips was run by a Chinese family, but I tried it anyways. I got chicken strips and fries, and MAN WAS IT HOTTT! I had to wait almost 10 minutes before I could start eating it, but once cooled, it was pretty good. My friend ordered the One fish and was kinda disappointed because it just seemed to be a giant fish stick. She ate it anyways. I kinda want to try their Alfredo or spaghetti, just to see how it is. Users/BrookeB

20090714 20:34:35 nbsp Yummy food!  If youre craving some greasy, yet delicious food, this is the spot for you.  HUGE portions, dont order too much because you will get a lot of food! Users/davisgirl10

20090717 19:21:33 nbsp Rice bowls and bento boxes are a pretty good value although I think the rice bowls are best out of the bunch.  The staff are amazingly nice.  Today they didnt have rice ready when I ordered my chicken rice bowl (just as the opened) so they comped me a little and prepared the rice right.  Im very happy that they have added such inexpensive rice bowls to their menu.  My only wish is that they have different sauces to choose from ala wiki:chico:Pommes Frites. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090718 00:02:01 nbsp Ive eaten here twice now.  FishnChips has super friendly owners and huray, clam strips!  For some reason though Ive felt very sick after eating here both times.  It may just be due to the severe amount of grease (I usually have a high tolerance for junkfood) but a lot of people seem to love them so perhaps my stomach just doesnt like something they use here.  Too bad, I love me some clam strips. Users/OliviaY

20090721 07:48:51 nbsp Great customer service. The staff is very kind and always asks the customers if they need anything.
I love their fish & chips too. Users/thisisht

20090804 00:39:49 nbsp Elderly employees working behind the counter were friendly.  Ordered the 1 fish combo.  I know its deep fried, but damn the fish was greasy.  I didnt feel very well after eating the fish.  Ive been to other restaurants with deep fried fish so I know its possible to not have it so greasy.  The zucchini is still delicious as ever.  Interesting that they sell Japanese food and tacos at this restaurant.   Users/BenLee

20090927 19:56:07 nbsp They have a great Teriyaki Chicken (Tofu too) bowl that is healthy and the price is right. Fish and chips is always good too. Nice folks with a great menu choice. Users/GarySaylin

20091111 11:06:11 nbsp Ew. There was a bit of plastic and some metal in my clam chowder. When I pointed it out to the waiter he asked if I wanted another bowl. Gross. Users/GJC02

20100125 13:00:31 nbsp LONDON FISH N CHIPS HAS IS STILL SERVING FISH N CHIPS BUT IT HAS CHANGED TO THE DUMPLING HOUSE!!! The dumplings are amazing...and the fish n chips are great as usual..great place to take a date! OH! and...this Sunday, Jan 31rst...all the money will go to help haiti. please go and eat there!!! Users/liuballs

20100125 23:11:43 nbsp The Dumpling House (formerly London Fish & Chips) still serves fish and chips, but is primarly a great dumpling restaurant. I tried the vegetarian dumplings when they opened Sunday (the 25th). I plan to go back again and again, especially this coming Sunday when they will donate proceeds to Haiti relief. Users/GarySaylin

20100126 07:58:29 nbsp I think this place took two years off of my life, but it was worth every deep fried piece of fish, potato, and candy bar. Users/Risky

20110804 15:10:03 nbsp Used to love coming here, food always perfect, service always friendly.  Random memory: They had napkins with a cartoon on them, depicting some buy at a fish n chips place in the UK, asking for the fish to be wrapped in that days newspaper.  Loved eating here, then going to Yesterdays to look at books... that place had the smell of pipe tobacco, and an endless treasure of books to comb through. Users/OldDavis73
