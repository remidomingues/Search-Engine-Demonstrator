 Directions 


From Davis go west on Russell Boulevard or Covell Boulevard  Covell becomes Highway 128 and merges with Russell.  Follow 128 past Monticello Dam and the south shores of Lake Berryessa.  At Turtle Rock bar, turn right on Berryessa/Knoxville Road.  Follow Berryessa/Knoxville around the north side of Lake Berryessa and continue north into the hills below Blue Ridge/Rocky Ridge Blue Ridge.  The road will go over eight low water crossings, which may not be passable after recent heavy rain.  Park about 9.5 miles up the creek from Lake Berryessa, around mile marker #28, at old corral on the right side of the road.  The drive is relaxing and the hike is great, but due to the curvy roads the drive is about a one and half to two hours from Davis.

20120528 21:32:57 nbsp Beware it is a long and laborious drive up there. This page originally had the drive at an hour. I was exasperated to find that it is really closer to two hourswhich means I could have driven to Point Reyes in less time. GoogleMaps says it is over 66 miles from Davis to Long Canyon and many stretches of the road are slow. I should have checked a map rather than trusting this page! Users/MichaelPlotkin
