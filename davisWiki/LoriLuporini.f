20070329 23:50:47 nbsp Are you indeed the new owners of Java California? Regardless, welcome! If you are, just wanted to say from an exDavisite that Java California is one of the best things about Davis (odd, being that JC isnt even in Davis...). Thats not a knock against Davis, just that JC is so great. I spent a lot of time (and money) working there late at night. Users/EricKlein

20070405 10:14:56 nbsp Congrats on your new store; I really hope you give the place a good scrub as the previous owner saw fit to violate every health code there is. Its not cool to serve people undated old food and halfcurdled milk thats been resteamed so many times it makes the coffee taste like ass. Users/Lauren
