Describe Users/LoriOrf here.

  I lived in Davis from January 2009 to June 2012.
  I miss Davis but enjoy living elsewhere with my husband, our kitten kaboodle named Fiona, and our dog named Mumford.
  I attended CSUS and graduated with honors with a BA in Psychology on May 18, 2012.
  I went to Taqueria Davis at least once a week, that is what I miss about Davis most of all.
  I used to volunteer in the kitty annex at the Yolo County Animal Shelter.




20110818 09:57:14 nbsp Its very belated, but welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for all the gnoming! Users/TomGarberson


20110902 18:09:53 nbsp Yikes.  Sorry you got that kind of reaction to your review.  I think most people understood your complaint.  That was a very reasonable reply to an unreasonable attack, by the way. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110906 18:56:25 nbsp Thanks Lori! Both my bunnies are rescues so I definitely know what you mean. One was kept in a small cage the first year of her life, the other was found dumped in the wild. I encourage you to write a letter to Ace as well. Maybe right now they think Im the only person who cares about it. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111106 10:55:26 nbsp Thanks for the updates on Fiona and your user page!  Just so you know, you can link to any page on the wiki by putting just the title of the page in brackets and quotes, {{{like this}}}.  Check out wiki:wikispot:Help with Linking for more info. Users/JonathanLawton

20111106 13:27:41 nbsp Thanks, Lori. We are in agreement. Im glad you stand up to your friends since the animals cant. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111210 21:47:34 nbsp The restrictions are based on the IRS (were a nonprofit, or technically, were hosted on a nonprofit).  Technically, if it comes from the community, its okay.  That said, of course pushy marketspeak is generally removed or at least toned way down.  A helpful tip about deals  especially coming from somebody not benefiting from it  is fine, and usually sticks around.  Word it right and it should be fine.   Users/JabberWokky

20120122 12:18:10 nbsp Hi.  The full link is http://www.englishforums.com/English/OneOfThePluralOrSingular/ghvkk/post.htm (Scroll down a bit for the example.) Users/BruceHansen

I appreciate the deference. I am happy with the page either way, s or no s. Its a very small thing in the long run
and I dont want to make an issue out of nothing. Have a lovely day. Lori
 Yes, that particular s is a small matter, but Im wondering about the rule.  As you said FAHC is the subject and is is the verb.  Doesnt the that phrase conplicate the sentence to include comprises the Fil–Am at UC Davis. as part of the prepositional phrase?  I dont know what the authority is, but http://www.towson.edu/ows/moduleSVAGR.htm this seems like a good source.  Just calling to your attention;  you dont have to reply. bh

20120223 21:29:28 nbsp Awww, Fiona is so cute! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20120224 11:11:34 nbsp To whome it may concern We would really appreciate it if our page was left alone. It has nothing to do with you personally and the apartments are under new management and new ownership. The comments posted are irrelevant seeing as how they are from several years back. Please leave the page alone. Thank you Users/HLDAY

20120315 17:33:21 nbsp Hahahaha! Users/TomGarberson

20120315 18:28:10 nbsp Gasp! You mean go to the source?!?!? From the Wiki?!?!  NEVER! ;{{{^}}}P

Although in this case, the allegation is that they say one thing and then charge for something different.  Which is kind of hard to get somebody to admit to. Users/JabberWokky

20120319 17:26:02 nbsp Its been said before, but thanks again for all of your gnoming!  Great edits. Users/TomGarberson

20120322 15:42:12 nbsp Thank you, I saw it.  Hes gone far beyond the wikis; hes posting stuff on other websites as well. Users/TomGarberson

20120322 17:51:13 nbsp Tom asked me a couple hours ago to let it stand.

Is there a worse person to target with libel than an attorney who has free time? Users/JabberWokky

20120428 20:45:17 nbsp Yes, that must be it.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20120428 21:01:13 nbsp Yeah, me either.  Lets see if others notice now that weve spoken up. Users/CovertProfessor

20120527 20:01:37 nbsp Congratulations! Users/CovertProfessor
                                                 Thank you! Lori

20120709 13:01:30 nbsp Thanks!  Ill fix the entry to make that clearer. Users/CovertProfessor

20120907 14:47:04 nbsp Hard to know when to back away sometimes.... Users/PeteB

20120907 14:57:24 nbsp Probably a good call. Users/TomGarberson
  Yep. Users/DonShor
  Agreedhe wasnt going to give up on it. Users/PeteB

  Its frustrating when someone ignores facts and demonizes others, but restraint seemed to be the best option. You cant have a logical conversation with someone like that, and it didnt seem to be worth anyones time anymore.  Especially over such a trivial (in my opinion) matter. Now we just lie in wait for the next taxi war! While simultaneously knocking on wood that we get some free time between trolls :) Lori

20120908 05:36:00 nbsp Im about to attend a wedding (thus my lack of edits, as I can read on the road, but posting from my phone is a pain).  Its kind of like cleaning a fish tank: Its important it be addressed, and doing it right keeps everything alive and healthy, but itll be hard to remember any details of doing it in a few months.

So, thanks for helping keep the water clean (you and everybody else). Users/JabberWokky

20120914 13:24:44 nbsp To be fair, the events are likely spacial in nature as well. Users/JabberWokky
   Very true. Ive never been much for spatial intelligence and reasoning, I can get lost in my hometown. Im much more linguistically oriented, hence why I fix everyones spelling :)

20120920 20:42:50 nbsp Lorigloriawilliamson is suspicious but it is a different IP. Users/PeteB
  yeah, I saw that. Do you happen to know how to lock pages or is that some magic that only jabberwocky can do? Im holding off on reverting until they get distracted and go to bed or something. Otherwise its just a tennis match. Hopefully they took some Tylenol pm or something ;) lori

20120920 20:52:55 nbsp I dont know how to lock but Im bored so Ill revert as much as need be until they give up or I go home. Users/PeteB

20121026 08:57:24 nbsp I very much appreciate a good edit comment.  Also, I ploinked zubin into the banned list.  Five edits, all spam. Users/JabberWokky

20121120 17:56:14 nbsp Lori I saw the comment about Las Vegas above. Id be more than happy to help you frame up and start a Las Vegas Wiki if interested Users/PeteB

20121121 15:45:07 nbsp also you need zero (0) computer skills to start / run / build a wikispot wiki

dive in! if its too much ask Pete or JW or anyone on GnomeHQ Users/StevenDaubert

20121122 11:22:50 nbsp I grilled and smoked it :)  The recipe is from amazingribs.com, the ultimate smoked turkey.  Turned out absolutely delicious.  I still have a big bag of leftover turkey frozen, ready for another turkey pot pie sometime in the next week or two. Users/TomGarberson

20121130 20:56:56 nbsp LoriI have emailed Phil Neustrom to inquire about starting up the Vegas Wiki. Users/PeteB

20121204 15:38:01 nbsp Maybe not a sockpuppet, Loritheyre different IPs. Users/PeteB
    yeah, I saw that. Im tired of that page in general.

20130223 09:17:56 nbsp I know how that goes.  Hope you feel better soon.  Also, good answer on the edits issue.  I mean, really. Users/CovertProfessor

     Trololol? tg
     That was my suspicion from the beginning but I couldnt ignore a challenge to my intelligence. Peeps be trippin. Lori

20130305 19:25:27 nbsp Same could be done for Lost and Found Users/PeteB
    That is true. I might work on that after I work on the roommate page tomorrow or next week.  lg

20130319 17:10:11 nbsp Pls chime in on current situation because now statement is more of a personal attack especially the last part Users/ElizabethBarthel
     sorry to hear that. I wanted the statement to be purely factual and not bashing. Will chime in on talk page. Lori

20130323 23:09:43 nbsp Thanks!  Bekka is keeping good and busy, liking her job in Vacaville.  I know it can be stressful at times, though.  How are you liking the field? Users/TomGarberson
      school was definitely fun. I love taking tests and getting good grades. I had my first day of externship at an actual vet today. It was a good time but definitely very fast paced and tiring. I hope to become accustomed to the pace and standing up for 8+ hours.  Lori

20130325 21:19:25 nbsp Love the oxford! Cant believe I missed it... Users/Davidlm

20130510 19:11:16 nbsp That particular mistake always amuses me.  Ill often say noon because I figure if I say 12 PM people wont know what Im talking about. Users/CovertProfessor
      It seems to be a very common mistake. Ive fixed it on a few pages over the years and many friends have asked me which is correct. I also try to say noon and midnight because its just easier and leaves no room for misinterpretation. Or maybe the business is only open for one hour and Im mistaken ;)
       Heh... probably not.  cp

20130620 14:09:20 nbsp Hi lori, not sure who to contact about this. We recently received a review that is a blatant lie on our page two days ago. Who can we have remove it? Users/AllegreApartments
      Hello, there is generally a quick discussion on a talk page before deletions occur. Covertprofessor posted a comment that contains some info you might find helpful at the bottom of your user page, Users/AllegreApartments, if you havent already seen it. Lori

20130627 17:52:28 nbsp Thanks for keeping a gnomish eye on things Users/StevenDaubert

20130905 18:43:24 nbsp Hi LoriOrf,  thank you for taking a look at the Yogurtland comments section.  I am trying to work within the guidelines of DavisWiki but was disheartened to see such a comment on the page myself.  I have asked another Wiki user who goes by the name of CovertProfessor.  They have made really great suggestions in the past and I am awaiting their advice on how to handle the situation as well.  Some of the employees and a lot of the customers are from the cities this user has put down.  Is there anything you recommend I do to resolve this issue?  Your advice is much appreciated.  Thank you for your support. Users/AjayHira

20130906 11:09:18 nbsp Thank you Lori.  I am new to the Davis Wiki. From your advice, I now have a good grasp of what to do if I have a concern.  Take care. Users/AjayHira

20130921 13:38:18 nbsp https://rocwiki.org/PeteB/Isabella_and_Abigail Very true indeed :) Users/PeteB

20130923 17:57:55 nbsp Thank you for the thoughts Lori. Much appreciated. I miss her horriblyshe was a phenomenal character.  Users/PeteB

20131001 18:10:19 nbsp No I did not however Ive since moved on thank you for checking, and commenting out your comment Users/StevenDaubert

20131028 08:17:33 nbsp Thank you for your help with the quick edit someone left on my comment. As much as I try, I wish only the best for Viking Residents.  Users/rheascprent

20131120 18:13:23 nbsp Fixed.  In that case it wasnt a table, but a tip for future cases where you cant find the problem: unfinished bold and italics in tables can cause really strange problems later in the page.  Thanks for pointing it out! Users/JabberWokky

20131209 23:14:47 nbsp If you really want my thinking, I was saying that I hadnt checked that he was right; I was only fixing the links (since a new editor might get confused if they got a comment with broken markup). Users/JabberWokky
  Looks like Loris dry humor was a little too subtle here... I got a good chuckle, Lori!
    Doh, yes!  Of course!  I can only plea that it was late when I saw her comment, and part of my brain was clearly already asleep.  jw

 Dr. Baker understands me! It was a really terrible play on the phrase for Petes sake.  Lori

20140104 13:12:30 nbsp good catch :D I had it spelled NEWayze then toned down the snark a bit & plum forgot to drop that s {{{>_>}}} Users/StevenDaubert
        Thanks, I hoped that the correction wouldnt offend you and clearly it didnt. I had a friend in high school who would literally scream anyways is not a word!  This conditioned me to twitch and brace for the scream when I hear someone say it. Im a grammar enthusiast, but I try not to be overly strict on the wiki :)  ~ Lori

20140105 13:35:50 nbsp Fun times.  Its a pain to have happen, but its always kind of nice to see how many people step up to protect the wiki.  You rock. Users/JabberWokky
##          thanks, it seemed like a large and time consuming task for one person to revert all those pages. Go teamwork! Also, excellent call on the recent ban. Reading the exchanges and searching for motive is mindboggling. ~ Lori

20140124 16:20:56 nbsp Thanks for catching that spelling error. Im glad you supported Taqueria Davis when you were able! Users/DougWalter

20140819 08:10:54 nbsp I could well be missing something, but as celiac disease only affects the small intestine, unless they are eating the soap, gluten in it shouldnt affect anybody with the condition.  A bit of Googling confirm that, even if gluten gives them a rash, its when they eat it, not have it touch their skin (the rash is a reaction to ingested gluten).  Of course, Im certainly neither a doctor nor an expert on your friends condition!  I was just curious about the query. Users/JabberWokky

20140821 13:52:47 nbsp no gluten in my soaps. Users/DagonJones
