The district has a unified registration and student identification system, and students in all of the colleges receive the same identification card, the Student Access Card. Students in the district passed a measure in 2003 increasing student fees to pay for reduced rate passes for all public transit bus and light rail systems in Sacramento, Yolo, Folsom, El Dorado and Elk Grove. To get the pass, students must present a printed report showing that all fees are paid, with a zero balance owed to the district. The pass is in the form of a sticker that goes on the students card showing the valid period. For more information on the pass, see http://www.losrios.edu/lrc/lrc_sainfo.htm describing the card.
