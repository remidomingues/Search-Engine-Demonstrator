Scroll down and take a look at the DavisWiki section.  There is a plethora of penii youll have to go through, but thats typical for ED.  Its amusing that most of the ED entry on Daviswiki is still the text written by the early Davis Wiki editors way back when. jw

20110523 21:24:08 nbsp The funny thing is that I cant figure out if this is Josh or somebody spoofing Josh.  Although Josh knows Im a business owner, so Im leaning toward it being an attempt at mocking him. Users/JabberWokky

Thats some fucking shit.  First we get some pot peddling hippie bullshit downtown turning all of you pseudointellectual assholes into lazy bums, like you didnt have enough of that crap already, and now youre taking chill pills.  You know where to stuff stick your pill

I dont know what the hell youre trying to say, but I dont have ot put up with that crap.  Youre just a bunch of damaged people who cant make it out in the real world, so you do your academic crap and argue over content on some stupid ass website while wrecking real peoples livings.
   Absolutely.  Preach it, brother! jw

20110523 21:49:07 nbsp Soo... are you actually posting from Hurricane Electric?  When I was in high school, they used to host LAN parties and stuff. Users/TomGarberson

20110524 15:27:28 nbsp Youre worse, dude.  Youre running around whining and complaining about someone taking a dump on a companies reputation while suffering from epidemic diarrhea.  Youre just leaking shit all over, and in the end it links back to that company and makes them into the ones with that ahole.  Even if normal everyday undamaged nonacademic people never see that, youre annoying the damaged pseudointellectuals people that are just nerdy and damaged enough to stick around forever.  Theyll never completely delete it, they wont ever side with you, and if youre worried that theyre communist facist something somethings shouldnt you be worried they may even get just ore biased and do something even more Stalintastic?  I mean, I guess I thought it was kind of funny at first, but even Americas Funniest Home Videos eventually ran out of videos of guys getting hit in the nuts.  Users/EdWins

I.E. someone who realises doing the same thing forever does not work, and things need to change.  Users/MasonMurray

20110913 16:44:44 nbsp In real life, life does in fact feed on life. Who cares who wins? Winning is a fucking illusion in this mess. Wake the fuck up. Were all gonna die. Master or servant, this life means nothing unless you can transcend. Love, Scott Users/ScottMeehleib
