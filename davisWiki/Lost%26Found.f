20091101 13:32:00 nbsp Hello there. Welcome to the Wiki Welcome to Davis Wiki. I see you just edited our Front Page to promote a book. Thats not generally considered a good thing to do. If you want to write about this book, I suggest you create a page for the author, David L. Johnson, Jr., and write about the book there. When you have done that, feel free to link to the page from Noteworthy Published Authors. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Also, consider the Importance of using your RealName.
