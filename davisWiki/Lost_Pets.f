Losing a pet is a horrible thing. This page is meant to help people get a start on finding their beloved pet! Or, if youve found someone elses pet, you can post here to try to reach an owner. Please remember to add dates to postings.

Due to the number of missing pets, those who have been missing for one year or longer may be moved to the Lost Pets/Archive Lost Pets Archive page.

In addition, it helps to be proactive! Dont let your pet outside unsupervised in the first place (especially rabbits, with the heat and predators and http://www.littlebigcat.com/health/indoorsoroutdoors/ read here why you shouldnt let your cat outside). Whether they are indoor or outdoor, you should have your pet implanted with a small microchip. Although you cannot track a missing pet with a microchip, a person will likely contact a local animal humane society, shelter, animal hospital, etc., and one of the first things they will do is scan the animal to see if theres a microchip implanted, which will have all the relevant information to return your pet to you! This costs only $45 (plus an office visit) at the Vet Med Teaching Hospital VMTH, and can be done by most veterinarians, and is highly recommended! Some people with indoor cats keep a breakaway collar on them just in case they slip out. It helps to engrave indoor cat along with contact information so whoever finds them knows they are lost rather than just wandering.

What Else You Can Do

When you first lose (or find) a pet, here are some practical first steps you should take:

 1. Visit the Yolo County Animal Shelter (where your pet will likely end up if it is taken to the police, or if somebody finds it) in Woodland at 2640 E. Gibson Rd. It is open TuesdayFriday from 10am1pm and 26pm, and open Saturdays from 10am1pm and 24pm. They are closed Sundays and open for limited services (no adoptions) on Monday from 15PM. A shelter employee will have you file a lost report on your pet and walk you through the shelter to see if your pet is there. You may also file a lostreport at this location, please bring a printed photo if you can. Your lost report will be on file with the SPCA office there, and will be checked with every animal brought into the shelter. They  will also scan animals to check for microchips, so knowing your pets microchip number is handy, in addition to having the registration information up to date..
 2. Call the Yolo County http://www.yolospca.org/ SPCA at 5306628858 and provide a detailed description of your pet. If you have digital photos of your pet, you can email these to a SPCA representative to ycasrescue@hotmail.com
 3. Post fliers within at least 3block radius from your home or last seen location and talk to your neighbors directly.
 4. Call the Davis Police Department at their nonemergency number (530)7475400 (The people who found our dog called the Police Department).
 5. In addition to the Davis Wiki, post lost and found animals in the local https://www.facebook.com/groups/PetsLostAndFoundDavisCA/ facebook group. Members include YSPCA and UCD VMTH as well as several area vets and animal shelter employees. Please join https://www.facebook.com/groups/PetsLostAndFoundDavisCA/ this group and check it often so that it can be an effective community resource. You can also post ads in http://sacramento.craigslist.org/ Craigs List, http://www.davisenterprise.com/ Davis Enterprise, http://www.petfinder.com/ Petfinder and http://www.petharbor.com/ Pet Harbor.
 6. Post a flier at Petcos bulletin board and other pet stores, along with coffee shops and stories where people visit often (libraries, Target, schools, etc).
 7. If you lost a cat, realize that the cat may be hiding during the day due to all the commotion and dogs being walked outside. Go out at night when it is quiet and call your cats name. You may find that the cat has been hiding in the neighborhood nearby. They often dont go very far. There are excellent catfinding tips for a variety of cat personalities at http://www.catsinthebag.org Cats In The Bag.
 8. Call all of the veterinary clinics in Davis people bring and report found animals often.
 9. If you FOUND a pet, take it to a Veterinary Hospitals veterinarian to get it scanned for a microchip. File a found report with Animal Control. Post in the local https://www.facebook.com/groups/PetsLostAndFoundDavisCA/ facebook group.
10. If you cant care for it, take it to the Yolo County Animal Shelter or post in the local https://www.facebook.com/groups/PetsLostAndFoundDavisCA/ facebook group to see if anybody can foster for the time being.

GOOD LUCK everyone, and dont give up!!!

FOUND CAT: 08/07/14. Medium/Long haired, Siamese/Tabby mix with blue eyes
Found in vicinity of Lake and Covell Blvd. Medium/Long haired light brown coat with stripes on front legs. Dark ears and between ears, dark, fluffy tail. Timid, skinny and hungry. Ran away this morning (8/9/14) when I tried to feed it but did eat and let me take photos last evening at a close distance. Contact me at 5307599728 or 5308484374



 FOUND CAT: 7/20/2014. Black and white, probably a neutered boy NOT microchipped
Found at dusk (around 8pm) 7/20/14 in the North Davis Green Belt right next to Jalisco. I think he is a neutered boy but I could be wrong, he is pretty fluffy so it was hard to tell. Sweet affectionate full grown cat, not very chatty. No extra toes, clearly a beloved pet that is now a little skinny and dirty. One arm is mostly white the other had a black patch near the elbow, black tail. I have many more pictures, email me if interested. (feycooper@ gmail .com) We thought he looked like Indiana (another missing cat) and when we returned him the owner said it was not Indiana. We took him to VetMed and they scanned him for a chip but found nothing, and he had no collar. We released him back where we found him with some food.

SPOTTED SIX CATS: 1/10/14  1/14/2014.  Cat colony at east end of Arboretum
While biking the Davis Loop, I spotted these two cat friends, who were relaxing together in the sun. Are they wild, are they lost, are they at home around there? I dont know. But maybe somebody recognizes them as their own? It was at the end of the Arboretum towards Rocknasium. Its directly behind the new location of the Davis Flea Market. Come to think of it, on another point of the Davis bike loop, maybe a couple of weeks ago,  loop I saw a very sad, light haired cat, he was incredibly! lean, you saw all his bones :(, and exhausted. I didnt know what to do, as I dont want to catch a cat like that (we cant take a cat in our house). I mention this, because I think its very sad that people lose their cats like that. Because I bike a lot in Davis (about 4 5 times a week) I see cats without identification all the time and I think its better to keep them inside. Better for the birds as well. I think it should be enforced by law that all cats wear identification.

Tail piece 1/13/2014

Today when I biked by again, I saw the two cat friends again, now cozy socializing in the pipe, and a third, gray cat was joining them. Obviously these cats live here, so anybody looking for them, can find them here.

Tail Piece 2  1/14/2014

I biked by again and this time had my Canon with me. Unfortunately, no sharp photos again. Its like I thought, there are even more cats living there in a group. I took photos of 6 different ones (see all pics and compare closely) now. I suspect there even are more than six. I will keep an eye on them. These cats look good enough, but wear no identification and are very on their guard. Who knows if they belong to somebody?

 Users/ConstantiaOomen CO
 There have been feral cats living there for ever and a day, they want nothing to do with humans. totally feral. Some of them have punched ears, others dont. The kittens have gotten bigger as well, they are almost cats now. Daubert ~SD

 @ SD: Ah, so you knew abut this place? But what about the all grey cat (pic 2, 5 and 6) and the very big cat (in pic 3); could it be that they have joined the group? I see two cats in the Lost section with the names Nugget and Belchik, and it could well be them?  Users/ConstantiaOomen CO






FOUND CAT: 1/9/14. Short hair blond/light light orange

FOUND CAT:01/15/13. Young/kitten female? calico
Image(Stray kitten resized.jpg,thumbnail,400,left)I am 99% sure this is a girl, she looks pretty dirty right now, kind of skinny, I had to sit for a while before she would let me pet her, talkative, very sweet though. When I tried to pick her up she jumped out of my arms and now she wont let me get that close. No collar. Put out some food for her, she was very hungry and scared. This was in the Lexington apartment complex near campus and InNOut. Please call/txt (949)4562479 if this could be your cat! Sorry picture is so bad, I was going to take her inside and now I cant get too close so this is the best I could manage.
