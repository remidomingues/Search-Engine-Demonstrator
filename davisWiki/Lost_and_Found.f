For bicycles, go Bike Recovery System here, for everything else, continue...

If you have lost or found an item, (after doing the things below), list it here. You should also make tags/stickers reading Reward for Return email: xxxxx phone xxxx and place them on all your valuables, ESPECIALLY those things you carry with you or move around alot. Many, possibly most, people are honest and ethical and will return your item to you for free if you just make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Make a list of your items with descriptions, serial numbers, and photographs that way youll have something to go on when they disappear. Make a photocopy of the items in your wallet and your key ring. That way youll know what you lost/who to contact and can also remember what keys went where. Dont carry around more than you reasonably use. Make backups and spares, keep them in a safe at home.

 Lost items in Davis 
 Do you know where you lost it? If so, go there and look for it. Write a note Lost xxx. Email xxx and affix it there. Retrace your steps. What is the nearest place someone might have returned it to? Go there and ask if its been turned in. Leave a contact for them in case it gets turned in. If it was lost in the Memorial Union, see the MU Information Center Desk or call at 5307522222. If its very valuable, call the Davis Police Department ((530)7475400 ext. 4 or (530) 7475441) and leave a message. If on campus, visit the UC Davis Police Department, they have a lostandfound. If not located at any of those locations, there are more Lost and Founds  in the ARC and in Unitrans in South Hall. UCDPD also has a relationship with a commercial website that operates a http://ucdavislf.com/selectitemtype.aspx lost and found website.
 If its a Lost Pets lost pet theres a page for that.
 If you lost something in the computer labs campus computer lab you can check with the Computer Room Consultants CRC to see if the item is in the computer lab lost and found bin. After a week the lost items in the bin is turned over to the Academic Technology Services Client Services Desk in 1440 Surge II.
 If you lost something of value in a UC Davis Classrooms classroom or campus lecture halls lecture hall, it will be left in the classroom, usually in a container of some kind in the front of the room.  If the item is above a certain value (laptops, phones, small children), it will be sent immediately to the UC Davis Police Departments lostandfound.
 Sometimes, people place classified ads in The California Aggie.
 Make a post on http://community.livejournal.com/ucdavis/ UCDavis Livejournal
 Put up fliers.
 Post on Craigslist and/or the Davis Enterprise.

 Found items in Davis 
 Do the above in reverse. Leave a tag at the location saying Found item, turned in to MU Information Desk (for example). Turn it in to the info desk, or police department, or such. Sometimes its actually better to leave the item where it was to give the owner a chance to return and collect it.

You can put down your name and leave your number at the both the UCDPD office and the MU Info Desk, but there is little else you can do except hope a Good Samaritan turns it in while you wait. The majority of people are ethical and will return valuable lost items if they can. Its only a tiny number of individuals who do all the damage in society.

Make sure you have contact information on the items you carry, so if something is lost someone is able to return it to you. If theres no such info, they have little hope of returning it no matter how much they want to. I put my email and phone number on such items (i.e. cell phone). Larger supermarkets have plastic key ring tags which will allow them to get lost keys back to you, assuming you give accurate contact information.
 Found items on Campus 
  Turn it in to the UC Davis Police Department Police Department or MU Games Area Desk
