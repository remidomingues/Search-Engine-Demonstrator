Hi Louis.  Michaels ex wife is nearly always credited with helping create Village Homes.  See, for instance, the plague/plaque http://daviswiki.org/Village_Homes?actionFiles&doview&targetVillage_Homes_Plaque.JPG here.  Also, I reverted your change wherein you altered someone elses comment.  It made it appear as if they had said what you added to their comment.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070625 18:58:49 nbsp Hi Philip: unfortuneately you do not know the early history of Village Homes, being a longtime Davis resident, Michael Corbett wrote his first book A Better Place to Live these were the ideas that he implemented into the creation of Village Homes. His exspouse was not a part of the design concept or even supportive until it took off. Years later she coauthored a newer version of his original book, called Sustainable Communities. I think it is unfortunate when someone as modest and altruistic as Mike constantly gets his coat tails ridden on. Users/Louis

    You may be right that Mike did all of the work and Judy does not deserve the credit she got.  I dont know if thats true or not.  I do know that everything Ive read about Village Homes notes Judys role in the project.  I think you would be better served by expanding the entry by describing the specific things Mike did for the project.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
