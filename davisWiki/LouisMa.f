I know tons of people who parked in the visitor spots at The Colleges and went to class.  Are you saying that the spots are not always occupied?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070928 12:46:54 nbsp They are not always filled, which was what the wiki stated previously.  I both live here and work at the Leadership Learning Center office, and from what I have seen, people do park there, but not as often as the previous version implied, as TAPS does actually ticket there (its supposed to be 20minute parking).  Ill restore the mention that people do actually park there, but with those modifications. Users/LouisMa
