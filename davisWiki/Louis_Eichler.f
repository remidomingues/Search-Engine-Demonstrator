Louis A. P. Eichler was the original publisher of the Davis Enterprise (then called Davisville Enterprise). Prior to that, he had worked for another newspaper called the Cordelia XRay.  He ran the Enterprise from January 1, 1898 until he sold it to William H. Scott on September 15, 1899.  Eichler left the Davisville Enterprise for more lucrative work at The California Odd Fellow, a magazine that was based out of Sacramento.
