The Lounge Lizards is UC Daviss oldest a cappella music group. They are one of the most prominent a cappella groups on campus, including The Spokes, The Liquid Hotplates, and The Afterglow.

The group originally began in 1995 with a group of friends in the Integrated Studies Integrated Studies Program, living in the Tercero Residence Halls dorm building B at UC Davis. Magic happened in the dorm lounge and UC Davis first a cappella group was born. Now, after seventeen years, the Lounge Lizards are thriving more than ever, performing at a wide variety of events around the city of Davis, including the Farmers Market, Picnic Day, and other benefit performances. Thus far, one of the Lizards proudest moments was performing the national anthem at a San Francisco Giants game in 2001. They competed alongside the Liquid Hotplates at the Varsity Vocals International Championship on February 2nd, 2008 at UC Berkeley, and they were the only group from UC Davis to perform there on February 21st, 2009. They performed with Kings College Londons All The Kings Men in a spectacular showcase this past February, 2012. Look for the Lizards this year at the Farmers Market.
