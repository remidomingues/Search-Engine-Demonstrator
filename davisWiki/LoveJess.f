Did Preeti Girl go out of business? Even if this is the case, we keep the pages of businesses that are no more and modify the entries to reflect this fact. Check out Departed Businesses for a few examples. If you have any questions, you can ask them by clicking on my name and leaving a comment for me on my page. Happy editing! Users/WilliamLewis

20090324 15:52:20 nbsp While I could give you a phone number for the people that run the server as well as the agent for service of process, I dont see why youd need either. The former is for technical issues (not user support) and the latter is only relevant if youre trying to sue/depose the wikispot foundation or its directors. Youre probably interested in talking to someone who exercises editorial control. Such a person doesnt really exist. We as a community (and that includes you!) decide what is on the site, based on consensus that has been built up since 2004. If there is something you want to do that goes against this established consensus, go ahead and start a discussion and the community will discuss whatever issues you have. If you have any further questions, dont hesitate to ask. Users/WilliamLewis
