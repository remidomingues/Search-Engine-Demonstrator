  In a jam?  There are a variety of legal services available in Davis!


20120531 20:24:00 nbsp Justin Lowenthal has been my trusted commercial attorney for the better part of a year. Last year I started my own business full of starryeyed Icandoitmyselfness and came up pretty quickly against the realities of small business ownership: contracts, leases, accounting, TIs, predatory merchants, business structuring for optimal vs. haphazard growth, employment structure (this is a HUGE deal this year since they have raised the misclassification penalties to bankrupting minimums!!) and much, much more. Justin is savvy, clear cut, and his services are intensely personalized. And I can afford his rates!

I get regular updates about material I need to be keeping on file, how to protect my confidentiality, and how to streamline my setup. I never feel like I am being nickle and dimed for every second that we are conversing in fact I feel like he has spent way more unbilled time researching industry specific law for me than he should!

I definitely recommend giving him a call for a free consult. Hes fantastic at estates/wills/trusts work as well.

20120802 18:29:44 nbsp Had an initial consultation with Justin Lowenthal, about trademark and LLC incorporation. I was very impressed with Lowenthal and found him to be extremely professional and helpful. He went above and beyond what I expected from a consultation.

After the consultation, I emailed him an additional question and he responded extremely promptly. Any future legal needs I have, I will certainly consult Lowenthal
