  DPI Graphics & Design Services
  A Learn to Dance dance studio called The Space
  Lockers for student organizations
  Project Compost
  CoHo and Freeborn Hall storage rooms and industrial dishwashing room

Lower Freeborn can be accessed via:
  The south side of the building
  The north side of the building
  The MU Games Area  head down past the bowling lockers
  The Memorial Union MU  elevators and stairs

The ceiling of Lower Freeborn Hall, in between the basement and the first level, buildering can be accessed if:
  You have a flathead screwdriver and a short ladder
  No one else is around
  Youre not afraid of asbestos

Live in the KDVS Hallway
  The hallways of Lower Freeborn have also been used as a recording space by KDVS Engineers on occasion because of the natural reverb and interesting acoustics.
