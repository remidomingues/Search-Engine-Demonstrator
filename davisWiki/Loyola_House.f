The Loyola House (AKA List House, Unlist House, YSDHC house etc.) was located at 2938 Loyola Drive.  The residents were evicted, and the house is no longer hosting performances.

This house was the base of operations for You See Davis Hardcore and a practice/recording space for many local musicians. The walls were home to many parties (Hardcore Halloween I,II,III, Sachipalooza I,II,III, Davis Coeds Party) and the mattress enforced soundproof garage held lots of shows.  They used to have a fire pit but the asthmatic neighbor complained.
