 All About Lucky 
  The best thing about Lucky is his ability to make you smile no matter how bad youre feeling. He has catlike intuition and loves to cuddle and sleep all day. While he refuses to play with toys or other dogs, he loves the company of doting women...men not so much.


  Lucky was adopted from an abusive home at about 1 year old, and has come a long way from being a cowardly, fearful animal, to the loving, loyal pet we know today.


  Luckys favourite hiding places include: under the bed, behind the table, inside boxes, in his crate, kitchen cabinets, behind the toilet, on closet shelves...


  If Lucky could, he would likely enjoy spending his whole day behind a couch somewhere with no distractions or interruptionsnot even a break for a snack could tear him away.


  Lucky is a light eater, but when he does sit down for a meal, he requires privacy. He will not eat if someone is watching him, and he prefers to take his food out of his bowl in order to eat in a secluded, unreachable place.

  Lucky loves Users/EricWilliamWong Eric Wong, but just doesnt know it yet. :)

  On 1/31/14, Lucky had surgery to remove a bleeding tumor from his small intestine! Since then, he has made a full recovery (yay, go Lucky!)
