Lucy  Love

Come visit her at Madrigal Choir Tenor Sectionals.

Lucy is at Yale University (DHS 06).  She loves Madrigal Choir Madrigals and sings all of the time, to the dismay of her neighbors.
Her sister, Elaine, plays the cello.  Together with their mother, these formidable Fitz Gibbons make noise everywhere.
