Come join local coven Casadh an Gealach as we celebrate Lughnasadh. Lughnasadh is a Celtic harvest festival, honoring the Irish sun god Lugh. It is a time where we break bread with friends family and our community and share the bounty of the earth.

We welcome anyone and everyone and encourage questions, curiosity, and fun! We are an easygoing, open group of priests and priestesses who want to share this beautiful holiday, food, and merriment with the community.

If you have questions or need directions email us at casadhangealach@gmail.com

We will have gluten free and vegan breads and snacks. If you have another dietary concern or allergy, please let us know and we will be happy to accommodate you!
