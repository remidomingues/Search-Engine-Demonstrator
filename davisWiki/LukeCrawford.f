Luke Crawford lived in Woodland, not Davis, however he made the trek to Davis whenever he needed social contact, as Woodland lacks suitable facilities.  He created this page after running into Users/TarZxf at the Davis Food CoOp coop, who was wearing a will work for bandwidth shirt.  Being the opportunist he is, and having quite a lot of spare bandwidth, Luke tried to hire him.

(backstory here is that Luke did, in fact, hire Neal although payment was made in US currency rather than bandwidth.  Neal has since moved on to bigger and
better things.)

If you ask nicely, he might give you a http://prgmr.com/xen/ Xenbased virtual server.

Luke was a SCSI elitist.  Luke now feels that NCQ makes modern SATA drives, if not awesome, at least usable in a multiuser environment.

You can email Luke: MailTo(lsc AT prgmr DOT com)

Luke likes jolt, pho, and those really good avocado burgers that the cantina serves.
(Lukes doctor wont let him have jolt or (much) pho anymore)

Luke is useful if you need parts for odd computers, or if you need to host something that uses a lot of bandwidth.  He also occasionally needs people for programming jobs.  He claims to be able to fix most anything, but runs screaming from windows installations.

Luke is 6 tall and weighs 185Lbs.

Luke left Woodland in 07 for bayarea Xen consulting gigs, and now lives in Sunnyvale.  He currently is a computer janitor for Yahoo! during the day, and still runs a xenbased virtual private server hosting company at night.
