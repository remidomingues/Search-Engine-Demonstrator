Lula and Rebeccas Platform/Candidate Statement

“Be the change you wish to see in the world” – Mahatma Gandhi


We are running for ASUCD President and VicePresident to be passionate, active, and professional voices during these tough times. Our students demand strong leaders to fight for them during this period of State budget cuts, rising fees, and high unemployment. We will be those leaders and those voices.

Our joint experiences on this campus cover almost all aspects of student life; freshmen mentoring and academic counseling; serving you food at the Coffee House and facilitating the REACH retreat; fostering studentpolice relations and developing the leadership skills of student organizations; pushing for better UC environmental policy and educating students on campus violence prevention.

Our policy priorities, laid out below, focus on being tough, but fair advocates for students to the Administration, City and State; protecting our academic resources, supporting our rights as renters; and expanding entertainment options.

We ask that you join us in fighting for our disappearing resources, advocating for higher education in the State Capitol, and continue improving the quality of life for all students.

As the LEAD executive candidates, we are proud of our organization’s 9 years of accomplishments and service to the student body. LEAD has consistently balanced the ASUCD budget; fought for student resources and rights in City Hall and the Legislature; created and grown amazing programs like the Campus Center for the Environment, the Gender and Sexuality Commission, and Lobby Corps; promoted UCD’s best charitable program – Cal Aggie Camp; and coordinated many concerts and events.

Join us as we continue the LEAD tradition of working hard for all students.

The opportunity to make a significant change is a rare occurrence. Our combined resources extend far beyond ASUCD, and because of this we are in a position to take the association to new heights. We urge you to be a part of the change you wish to see by voting for Lula AhmedFalol and Rebecca Schwartz. Thank You.

We are also running with 6 amazing Senate candidates who we will need to accomplish our goals. Please vote for ALL 6 when you log on to vote on FEBRUARY 18th20th at https://elections.ucdavis.edu/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~OUR PLATFORM~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACADEMIC

Work with CalPIRGs Cheaper Textbooks Campaign to provide students with cost efficient and environmentally friendly alternatives to textbooks.

Urge professors to utilize ASUCD Campus Copies/Classical Notes when printing course readers. This will promote student jobs and reduce our students costs.

ADVOCACY

 Lobby the administration for more diversity among faculty and administration. Increase student representation on hiring committee for new faculty and administration.

 Institute ASUCD Lobby Month every May with ASUCD Lobby Corps. Expand this program to have at least one studentlobbyist in the California State Capitol every day the legislature is in session.

 Continue to build partnerships with ASUCD Lobby Corps and Student Recruitment and Retention Center (SRRC).

 Expand ASUCD Lobby Corps’ partnership training program to reach all campus centers and student organizations to increase the number of trained studentlobbyists.

 Commit to protecting ASUCD Cal Aggie Camp, ASUCD’s only philanthropy.


COSTEFFICIENT SOLUTIONS TO BUDGET CRISIS

 Foster collaboration between the Club Finance Council and the ASUCD Outreach Assembly in order to effectively educate clubs, advertise, and promote the efficient use of funds

 Audit all ASUCD Units in collaboration with the ASUCD Business and Finance Commission audits to eliminate any excess or overlap in spending


ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

 Install compost bins near all major foodtrash bins. Work with the City of Davis to follow implement similar programs.

 Work with ASUCD Environmental Policy and Planning Commission (EPPC) to eliminate “glossy” flyers, as these are not recyclable. We will promote environmentally friendly and still aesthetically pleasing ways to advertise.


RENTERS’ RIGHTS

 Work with the City of Davis and City/County Affairs to ensure student renters receive accumulated interest on their security deposits. Many cities in the US have already implemented these policies, the City should follow suit.


QUALITY OF ONCAMPUS STUDENT LIFE

 Increase the amount of indoor “lounge” space available during the ASUCD Coffee House renovations so students have guaranteed meeting/hang out/study locations.

 Increase amount of money available to student organizations! We will reallocate Outreach Assembly funding from stipends to a general pool of funding available to any student organization through an application process similar to Club Finance Council (CFC). In order to promote collaboration among campus organizations, the Outreach Assembly funding will be specifically tailored to cosponsored events.


ENTERTAINMENT:

 Institutionalize a Spring Quarter Sleepover in the Quad

 Reform ASUCD Entertainment partnership with the City of Davis

 Create an ASUCD Music and Arts Committee to strengthen the connection between the Arts community and UC Davis



Although we are committed to our platform, we acknowledge that limiting ourselves to only these issues would not be proper representation of the student body at large.

If you have any criticisms or suggestions (or jokes), please feel free to contact us!

Fall 2007 Candidate Statment
Hi fellow Aggies! My name is Lula AhmedFalol and I am running for ASUCD Senate.  Since beginning at UC Davis I have served our community an active member of the Campus Violence Prevention Program (CVPP); Director of ASUCD Pathfinder; a Peer Advising Counselor (PAC) for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP); and a Cultural Programmer for Student Housing. My offcampus experience includes interning for California Assembly Majority Leader Karen Bass at the State Capitol.

As a Senator, I will work to improve the quality of student life. My top priorities will be to increase finals week study locations and improve campus safety for freshmen. Students need access to numerous places to study during hectic finals week. I am working with local coffee shops to stay open until 2am or later during finals week, and so far I have received positive feedback. Additionally, I will continue my work to build a partnership between Student Housing and CVPP to post crime bulletins in the dorms. The more information freshmen have, the better decisions they can make about their safety.

I will expand ASUCD Pathfinder to outreach to the 70% of high schools in Yolo and Sacramento Counties that do not offer the classes necessary to be admitted to a UC. By reaching out to these communities, UC Davis students will academically prepare a diversity of students for college. Lastly, I will continue my efforts to enhance entertainment by working with the Entertainment Council, KDVS, Campus Unions, the Mondavi Center, and student artists and performers to increase the diversity and frequency of campus performances. Please join me in my efforts to do these and many other great things for students by voting Lula AhmedFalol. #1 for ASUCD Senate!

Thank You. Best regards, Lula AhmedFalol.
