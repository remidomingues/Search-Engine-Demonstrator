Lumpy is an insane squirrels squirrel. It has a tumor on the side of its face and inhabits the area by Wellman Hall on the UCD campus. Its pretty funny until it runs after you. Reports from a disclosed source residing on the Lacrosse team has seen it with his own two eyes and fears it! Find Lumpy, its a rare treat!



20080611 10:52:52 nbsp Yknow, if squirrels are anything like mice, Ive had several with tumors or abscesses on the sides of their faces (and on their sides).  Its a pretty common problem with all the rodents Im familiar with (mice groups tend to overlap rat and cavy groups).  It is quite possible that there is no single Lumpy or that if this Lumpy passes, another shadowtail will develop a similar lump and be dubbed Lumpy. Users/JabberWokky
