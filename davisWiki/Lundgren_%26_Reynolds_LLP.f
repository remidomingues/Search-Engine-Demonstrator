20110623 16:52:04 nbsp Stephen Reynolds was retained in 2010 in a complex Chapter 11 case that resolved seven years of litigation and millions of dollars of claims in seven months.  Mr. Reynolds and his staff coordinated with other counsel, rigorously pursued the research, and presented the case which (along with California and Washington State counsel) resulted in a settlement favorable to me.  Mr. Reynolds was professional, creative and charged a modest fee.  I am a retired attorney and base my opinion on twenty plus years of practice. Users/EdwardMacDonald
