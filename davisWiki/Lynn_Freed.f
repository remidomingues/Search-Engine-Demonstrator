Ms. Freed’s work can be found in various popular sources such as The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Vogue, among others. Her work is accessible to nearly everyone, because of the fact that it has been translated into a multitude of languages.

Ms. Freed has received various awards recognizing her work.  She has been awarded residency fellowships by The Rockefeller Foundation, The Camargo Foundation, and The Lanan Foundation, just to name a few.  One of her works, “The Curse of The Appropriate Man” is on The New York Times “Notable Books of the Year” list.  Finally, she was awarded the Katherine Anne Porter Award by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Although Ms. Freed is now a very well respected writer, she admits that she “wrote some very bad, sentimental, predictable stories (when she was a girl).”  Her best advice for young writers to be patient, because it took her ten years or more to develop the kind of literary voice she is known for today.  She admits that she didn’t always want to be a writer.  She almost enrolled in law school in hopes of securing a sizable income, but she realized her true passion and made the bold decision to stick with it.
