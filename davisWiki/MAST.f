http://mast.ucdavis.edu/ MAST stands for Mathematics and Science teaching programs.  This is a program for undergraduates who plan on becoming secondary or middle school math and/or science teachers.  The focus here is on giving students enough experience to make the transition from learning to teaching by exposing them to elementary, middle, and highschool classrooms.

MaryBetty Stevenson, the MAST Center Director can be reached at the MAST Resource Center, 1023 Sciences Laboratory Building.
Her hours for Winter & Spring quarters 2007 are: Monday 111 and Thursday 111 (other times by appointment)
