20090511 20:29:42 nbsp Ling Tseng at this location is the best. I just bought my very first home and she guided me along every step of the way, from those first tremulous moments when I made the initial inquiry to the closing day when she handed me the key to my new house. She quickly tuned in to the kind of house that would suit my needs and focused our visits on properties that matched my criteria. She educated me about each aspect of a home purchase, explaining all the documents I signed, answering all my questions in clear terms.  Moreover, she kept in touch and was accessible. Im writing this from my new home!! Users/vlantry
