20090605 21:15:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. Barbieri and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  Thanks for your comment on Plutos.  Did you  report the food poisoning?  It can be a fatal health hazard to the young, elderly or immune compromised, and can also be easily mistaken for other things, and should be reported if you really think you got food poisoning from a restaurant.  Some types of food poisoning can also leave permanent neurological damage, so if you really suspect it, you should see a doctor.  I hope you and your friends are well, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
