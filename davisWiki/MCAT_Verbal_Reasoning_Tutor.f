Self Evaluation of Your TestTaking Strengths and Weaknesses is Key to Achieving High Scores:
Raising your VERBAL practice scores consistently is very possible.

So is scoring as high as you desire on the real MCAT Verbal Reasoning Section on Test Day.

All it takes is your willingness to think through and accurately execute every necessary step toward success.

A slight change in attitude may help as well.

Do you attack the VR as though it were a normal reading comprehension test?
How is that working out for you?
Do you get stressed out from dealing with the MCAT VRs Uniqueness?

Perhaps individualized VR tutoring is for you.

Lower stress by approaching the MCAT VR on its unique terms.

Try reading the passages like they were challenging and (hypothetically) fascinating magazine articles.

Stress will decrease while your practice score numbers increase.

I have tutored the MCAT VR at the UCD Experimental College and independently for two years.
I know its quirks and can help you as an individual adapt to them.
