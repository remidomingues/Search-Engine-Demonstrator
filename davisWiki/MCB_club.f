The Molecular and Cellular Biology Club (MCB Club) is comprised of UCD students who are interested biology. The club focuses on cell biology, biochemistry, and genetics, but anyone with a passion for general life sciences is always welcome. Meetings are every 12 weeks and feature guest speakers including professors and people from the ICC (Internship and Career Center). These presenters love describing their research and giving suggestions about how to get a job in the field. Of course there are also delicious snacks. Besides regular meetings, there are also social events that help members get to know each other and have fun. At bowling night the MCB club beat the NPB club for the 2nd year in a row. The end of year barbecue is also a great way to relax with fellow members. This is a great club for both bio and nonbio related majors. Not sure if youâ€™re interested? Visit the club website for more information or stop by the department office. Better yet, come to the first general meeting of Fall 2009 (TBA) and talk to some current members or professors.
