Welcome to the Wiki Howdy,  Mr. or Ms. 324, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  It would be kind of odd to run into you and have you introduce yourself as MD324, eh?  :)  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for your recent reviews... years ago I dated a woman who lived at Cambridge  shes now Mrs. Edwards :)  and I never really had problems with parking, although it tends to fill up in some of the corners faster than others.  Some people likely just dont want to have to walk all the way across across the complex, and complain about parking as a result.  Kind of silly; Ive lived in places with serious parking issues, and Cambridge never struck me as difficult.  At any rate, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
