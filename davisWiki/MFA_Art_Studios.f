The MFA Art Studios are for Master of Fine Art students in the Art Department Studio Art Program.  There are several studios within the building and another 4 located in TB9.  These studios are essentially a workspace for MFA art students.

The studios are opposite the of Art Building Art Building across Parking Lot 6.  There is a short driveway which leads to the door (see photo).

Do not be tempted to Parking park in the driveway, you will get a TAPS ticket.  The studios are in use nearly 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  You may, however, circle for hours and hours if you need to in order to pick somebody up.
