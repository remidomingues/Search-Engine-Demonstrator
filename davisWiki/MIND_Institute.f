The UC Davis MIND Institute (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) is a research facility and outpatient clinic located in Sacramento and part of the UC Davis Medical Center campus. Clinicians and researchers specialize in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/resources/fragile_x_syndrome.html fragile X syndrome, http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/resources/tourette_syndrome.html Tourette syndrome, ADHD, http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/resources/down_syndrome.html Down syndrome, and http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/resources/22q11.2_deletion_syndrome.html chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

The main building is split into a http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/research/index.html research clinic, where visits are primarily for participation in any number of https://mindweb.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/studies/index.php ongoing research projects, and an http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/clinic/index.html outpatient clinic where clinicians conduct diagnostic and other specialty appointments with children, adolescents, and adults with neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, there is a basic science facility adjacent to the main building where many of the molecular aspects of the research studies are undertaken. Typically developing children, adolescents, and adults are often wanted for participation as control participants in studies at the MIND Institute.

It hosts a distinguished lecturer series which is open to the public (details on web site). Many of these and other lectures are archived on the website for anyone to see. If you are a university affiliate, you can get there on the UCDMC Bus Line UCDMC Shuttle for $1.50 (passes must be bought in advance). Volunteers are able to ride this shuttle for free with their yellow volunteer badges.

The MIND Institute presents opportunities for undergraduates at local colleges and universities as well as other community members who are interested in behavioral sciences to get involved in research and clinical settings. More information can be found at the Internship and Career Center. Additionally, information on volunteer opportunities at the MIND Institute http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/giving/volunteer/ can be found here.
