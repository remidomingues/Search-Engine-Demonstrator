20080730 01:18:45 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. F, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding information to the Skin Renewal Center, however editing other peoples attributed reviews and changing their names seems a bit strange and is generally not the way things are done.  You might want to look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner informal guide to the wiki for business owners to get an idea of what common traditions there are around here.  As part of the community, feel free to edit all over the wiki  theres just some polite customs that have evolved over time so that everybody has a chance to have their say.  Of course, there may have been some kind of reasoning behind your edits that I just didnt understand  thats why we tend to discuss such things.  If you have any questions, just ask.  Once again, thanks for adding the information (I copied it up to the top, which you should feel free to edit), and again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
