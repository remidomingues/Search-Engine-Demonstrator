 2014 Davis Dance Revolution CHAMPIONS 


MK Modern began when a group of students who were involved in Mga Kapatids
Pilipino Culture Night decided to expand their passion for dance to the
next level. From its humble beginnings MK Modern has evolved into a
prominent dance group on the UC Davis campus that seeks out fresh, raw
talent and new opportunities to add to its continually growing history.

The diversity of its members always add a refreshing, new flavor to the
team dynamic and is a true testament to the constant reinvention of this
group. The variety of dance styles serve as the medium through which this
multicultural family expresses their love for hiphop. MK Modern prides
itself in creating dances that pump up and ultimately entertain the crowds
as they continue to give Davis a taste of whats fresh in the dance
community.
