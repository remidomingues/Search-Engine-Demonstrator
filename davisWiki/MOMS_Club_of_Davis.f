MOMS stands for Moms Offering Moms Support and that’s exactly what theyre all about!  They are a local chapter of a larger nonprofit organization designed to provide support, daytime activities, and  resources to moms in Davis who stay at home with their children either fulltime or parttime.

The organization provides  wonderful opportunities for Moms Groups mothers in our community to connect with each other, have  fun, and form lasting friendships.





What They Do:
 Special Weekly Activities & Park Days: A variety of nocost and lowcost activities are scheduled during various days and times throughout the week to accommodate different schedules. Weekly park days are scheduled along with fun events that appeal to children of different ages.
 Playgroups: Each playgroup is divided by age range and sets the schedule and location that works best for its members. A playgroup leader helps facilitate playdates and acts as a liaison to the club at large.
 Babysitting CoOp: Members share babysitting among themselves without the exchange of money. The coop is intended for occasional—not regular—childcare. Quarterly meetings ensure the coop is running smoothly.
 Moms Night Out: Special monthly events, typically held in the evenings, give moms a muchneeded break from the kids! Events may include dinner, a movienight, or a special “momonly” gathering!
 Members Meetings: These daytime meetings are held monthly in conjunction with fun activities to get to know other members better! All members are encouraged to attend (with their children, of course) and provide activity ideas, feedback, and make decisions that impact the club.

Dues are $25 per year and pay for our rentals, supplies, and programs. Prospective members are invited to attend two meetings or scheduled public activities prior to joining.
