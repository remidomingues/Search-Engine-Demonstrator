The first mutterings of MONUMENT were Users/DanMasiel heard around the spring of 04. It has since ballooned into a vast and poorly understood Marijuana conspiracy, whose members identify themselves only through a complicated series of facial gestures and hand movements.

MONUMENT was a shortly lived literary magazine.  Users/DanMasiel Dan Masiel was involved.  He notes that:
  Monument was a lot of talk and very little action. Or should I say very slow action. It is actually fully laid out, Ive screen printed 140 really nice covers and I still havent gotten around to printing the insides of the damned thing. I am just too lazy to jack photocopies from somewhere and too cheap to pay to have it printed. But you know what, Im willing to bet that someday it will be released and whole lot of people that I ranted at long ago will be very surprised. Im keeping my fingers crossed...
     If cost is the issue, you could take up a voluntary collection, or have people buy them presale (i.e. $2 preprinting, $5 afterwards). Sell them as rare, unique art objects instead of cheap zines and you should be able to more than cover the cost.



It should be noted that an issue of Monument has, in fact, been published and distributed.  If you did not receive a copy its because youve been deemed dangerous to the Monumentalist Movement; so we cant have you getting your hands on the zine, deciphering the carefully encoded messages, and fouling up our plans.
