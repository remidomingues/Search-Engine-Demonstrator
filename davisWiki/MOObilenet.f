MoobileNet is the UC Davis WiFi wireless network.  The network can be used by campus students, faculty and staff, as long as you have a UC Davis Kerberos login (the thing you use for email and MyUCDavis).  For more information (like how to set up your PC/Mac to use the network and how to connect), go to their website at http://wireless.ucdavis.edu wireless.ucdavis.edu.

There are two wireless networks on campus  moobilenet and moobilenetx.

Moobilenetx uses secure wiki:wikipedia:WiFi Protected Access WPAEnterprise (as opposed to WPAPSK) encryption so all of your data is transmitted and received over an encrypted connection.  This used to work with a special applet where you had to first log in to moobilenet and then have it transfer you over to moobilenetx.  Now (or was it always?) you just need your Kerberos login and WPAEnterprise provides encryption keys without your manual intervention.  These keys can be regularly changed without your knowledge which adds an extra level of security to your communications! That said,
> You should always use moobilenetx for your security!<

Another added bonus is that your Kerberos credentials can be remembered by your OS and so you can have near flawless transitions between wireless access points and have Internet connectivity as fast as your equipment can manage.

Here are quick links to get you setup with moobilenetx:

Alternatively, to connect to the unsecured wireless network moobilenet:

Step 1: Choose moobilenet from available wireless networks.

Step 2: Open your web browser and login with your UC Davis LoginID and kerberos password.

Step 3: Start browsing the web!  But do keep in mind your connection can be easily snooped; dont access mail if your password isnt transmitted with encryption and dont use programs like AOL Instant Messenger.  You may be surprised that your password to access mail on many POP servers may be in cleartext; and so too are mail that you receive.  Most modern IMAP servers require encryption for identification and/or general connectivity; check to be sure.  Someone can easily snoop on all your nonhttps web traffic.  Things like online banking are usually https so theyre generally secure  but if you see any warning messages dont use the site.



Shields Library is not known to have adequate bandwidth for the hundreds of people in the vicinity that, during the day, simultaneously connect to MOObileNet.

In the spring of 2011 the campus joined the http://www.eduroamus.org/ eduroam group which lets visitors from other member campuses use wireless at UC Davis, and UC Davis folks can in turn use wireless on other member campuses.


20070424 18:01:45 nbsp Many of the wireless spots dont really get a good enough signal to actually get on (specifically the one located on the border of hutchinson/storer. Users/MattHh

20070611 00:11:53 nbsp Anyone want to wardrive the campus to get a dynamic map of signal strengths. Ive really had hit or miss luck in some places like the domes which this map claims to cover. Users/AlexMandel

20090515 12:22:25 nbsp What kind of speed does MOObilenet provide? I know the campus computers are blazingly fast, but I would be surprised if even full 802.11g WiFi speeds were available on the wireless. I suspect that its heavily throttled, but Ive not seen evidence one way or the other for that. Users/RobertM525

20100104 14:53:31 nbsp Unfortunately, coverage of both networks is still not complete, and there are places where moobilenet is available but moobilenetx isnt.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100114 10:28:43 nbsp Suddenly Im getting really good signals in Olson 241 (it has been impossible this quarter until now).  Maybe its environmental but I sure do like using my laptops keyboard over old iMac keyboards (such high relief, wrist killing buttons!).  Heres hoping coverage is continuous over the quarter. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20100129 11:34:31 nbsp For anyone else whos been frustrated, I was finally able to get my (Tmobile) Blackberry to connect. Type: PEAP. CA Certificate: Equifax Secure Certificate. Inner link security: AUTO. Token: None selected. Everything else blank. Users/BrianNeal

20110228 13:02:48 nbsp Does anyone else feel like moobilenet is incredibly unreliable? It usually takes me at least 5 minutes to connect and then it will often cut out and come back in.  Users/RajanSingh

20110509 16:49:00 nbsp Has moobilenetx stopped working for anyone else? I think it was like 2009 since the last time I used it. Users/MattCorey
  Works for me.  But coverage is spotty.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120309 12:35:40 nbsp Moobilenet connectivity has been terrible lately (Im actually posting this from my phone, hah). It seems extremely bad in the silo and the MU, particulary during peak hours. Im no networking whiz, but it seems that the hardware is unable to keep up with the sudden influx of wireless devices. Even when I manage to connect on moobilenet or moobilenetx, I am often met with huge pings (on the order of 2k ms) or extreme packet loss. Users/AbbYu

20120309 19:00:35 nbsp Ive had problems with it lately too.  In some areas, the wifi routers are getting overwhelmed with too many devices wanting to connect, although I suspect there are other problems too  such as the authentication server.  I actually talked to IET about this.  They said that its up to the department (such as Campus Unions or the ARC) to request and pay for additional base stations if they want them.  The problem with this is that the department that pays for the device is not the same as the user of the device, so they dont have much incentive to order better hardware.

I frequently am unable to connect with my own devices, and when I am, the connection often drops in a few seconds.

Oddly, Im also sometimes unable to connect in areas with lightly used networks, such as around buildings where most people connect via ethernet. Users/IDoNotExist

20120309 19:46:43 nbsp I havent had trouble at the MU, but Ive had trouble near the Silo. Users/CovertProfessor

20120611 21:14:09 nbsp Does anyone know how to connect an xbox 360 to the moobilenet network? Ive tried setting my login info and password but it still wont let me! Users/GabrielMunoz

  Try connecting to moobilenetX instead, since moobilenet requires the popup authentication.   Users/tyang
