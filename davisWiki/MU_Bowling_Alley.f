The MU Games Area Memorial Union Games Areas Bowling Alley is the bowling alley for Davis.  This is because, well, its the only bowling alley in the city and has 16 lanes to choose from along with a billiards and arcade area.  The prices are cheap for all and you get a discount for showing your Reg Card. This is where the UC Davis Bowling Club practices.




RESERVATION POLICY: We do allow you to reserve lanes for group events. You must call at least 7 days in advance to request a reservation. We do not take reservations for Thursday nights after 9pm, or from 5pm Friday through 6pm Sunday.


If you want to palm the ball youll need to use one of the special palming balls located next to the first lane.  This is because the wood used in the lanes is especially sensitive and the holes hitting the ground somehow cause problems if the balls being palmed, so just pick up one of those nearly holeless balls and palm away.
The problem comes from the ring of the hole landing on the wood so it gives these half moon cuts into the wood Daubert

The bowling alley has Moonlight Bowling (aka Rockin Bowling or Disco Bowling) when they turn the music way up and they turn down the house lights in favor of a crazy multicolored light show on the bowling floor.  Its kind of distracting when you are trying to bowl, but it makes it really entertaining.   This takes place ThursdaySaturday nights.  It goes from 10:00 pm until 12:00 midnight.  (During vacation schedule, its from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm.)

If for some reason you have the desire to flee Davis and want to go bowling, Vacaville is home to http://www.starsrecreation.com/ STARS Recreation Center, open 24 hours. STARS has around 40 lanes of bowling, it also has a small arcade, laser tag, and a bars bar. STARS is at http://maps.google.com/maps?q155+browns+valley+parkway,+vacaville,+ca&spn0.031071,0.060176&hlen 155 Browns Valley Parkway, across the street from Nugget the Nugget. To get there go Westbound on i 80 80, take Monte Vista/Browns Valley Parkway exit. That will put you right there. There is currently construction, I apologize.


Users/MichelleAccurso Ive also heard that theres some bar upstairs with pooltables, but Im underage so I dont know.

20090922 16:23:09 nbsp I just called the MU to reserve 4 lanes for this coming weekend as a part of a birthday party.  Be warned they require 1 week notice to reserve lanes.  On a seperate note, Ive been to Stars and its wonderful, I wouldnt pay to bowl there, but the comment below is correct they have a small seperate bar upstairs with pool tables and a balcony so you can look down on the music stage.  They have great live music on the weekends, mostly cover bands, but there is a cover. Users/SaraRoscoe

20100211 15:37:09 nbsp I like the MU Bowling Alley better than Stars. Its cheaper and has a more fun clientele and vibe than than STARS bowling alley. (They have great laser tag though!)

The best thing about the MU is that they always give me the student price even though I dont go to UC Davis. Since I go with a Davis student and look like I could be a student they just assume Im one without asking for my ID. Nice. Users/bear

20110124 20:47:53 nbsp bear, you do realize that if one person in the group is a UC Davis student, the entire group gets discounted price, right?  Users/whereyouat
