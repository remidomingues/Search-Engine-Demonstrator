Phone Number: (530) 7569903

Perfect for impromptu phone calls and latenight rendezvous.  Also, if youre a superhero, this is the perfect phone booth to change into your costume in.  The door of the phone booth was removed during Feburary of 2005, but returned in March.

Charge: 50 cents for local calls.


One time I was out of cellphone battery and I used this phone to call a friend.  Once youre inside it (with the door closed) you feel like youre in a British spy movie.  I love the rough feel of the telephone booth and how heavy the metal door is.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

Summer Advisors used to (and perhaps still do) use this phone booth as a lame icebreaker by egging the Freshmen into stuffing as many of themselves into it as they can simultaneously.  Users/TravisGrathwell
  I saw this happen over this past summer. I guess thats as close as you can come to still do  Users/KenBloom
