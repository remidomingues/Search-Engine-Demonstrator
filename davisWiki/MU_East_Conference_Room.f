MU East Conference Room is located across from the Information Booth in the east side of the Memorial Union. The room is rectangular and has very loud air conditioning which makes it a bad place for meetings. It is often used by ASUCD to announce the results of ASUCD Elections when there is bad weather. It is also used for storage by the UCD Bookstore during the bookbuy rush at the beginning of each quarter.

There are rumors that the UCD administration is considering bringing a bank to fill in the space.
