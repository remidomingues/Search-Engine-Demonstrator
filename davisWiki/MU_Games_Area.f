Located in the lower level of the Memorial Union, under the UC Davis Bookstore, the MU Games Area, often abbreviated MUGA, is a fantastic and magical place filled with over 50 Arcade Arcade Videogaming games, MU Bowling Alley a bowling alley and ten Pool Tables pool tables.

The MUGA is a melting pot (more of a salad bowl, actually) of different gaming groups. They tend to divide themselves as such:

  Initial D fans gather around the fourplayer Initial D machine to hone their skills and memorize the various twists and turns of all the courses.
  The rhythm game fans gather around the Pump It Up machine and try and get the moves down on harder and harder songs.
  The fighting game fans gather in The Arcade Room to see who has the m4dd35t 5k1llz.

Warning: Use the UCD Bathrooms bathrooms here at your own risk!!  It isnt pretty at all.  Users/StevenDaubert thinks this lies, the Games Area has made an effort to clean up the male bathrooms.

20100227 01:27:10 nbsp Its such a crock about the ADA, the bookstore chooses to not open the lower doors (next to pump it up and fast and furious motorcyle) when they do the textbook buyback. Wheelchairs can use that lower door after taking the elevator. They stopped using that lower door to make people go in and out of bookstore thru the upper entrances Users/StevenDaubert
