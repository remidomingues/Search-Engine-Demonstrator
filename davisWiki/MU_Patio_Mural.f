Kim Anno and Miranda Bergman
The Unfinished Dream, 1991
acrylic mural

Commissioned by the Office of Student Affairs and the Campus Art in Public Places Work Group

In June, 1990 UC Davis Art in Public Places issued a call to artists for a mural competition to portray UC Davis transition to a campus of true diversity, reflecting the richness of its many cultures and supporting its growing underrepresented populations. Kim Anno and Miranda Bergman were selected by a committee of students, staff and faculty to paint the mural. The evolution of this mural was a collaboration between Anno and Bergman at every stage, from discussions and research to creating the sketch and painting it. There were several meetings with student groups for input and discussion of the design. The meetings resulted in changes in the sketch and made the designing of the mural a vital and interactive process. In addition, students participated in the painting of the mural.http://artstudio.ucdavis.edu/gallery/public/ source (See #8)

20090309 20:46:38 nbsp This mural weirds me out. Some friends and I had a long talk about it one day during lunch. There are just so many different cultural references, and too many of them were not understood by us.  Users/TimMatthiessen

20100914 15:11:28 nbsp This is a racist mural. It does not depict underepresented populations, just those who are thought to be as such. It depicts the racist palestinian/Sudanese flag of intolerance and racism. if this mural truly represented all of Davis, it would have some Jewish iconography somewhere, especially in light of the many hate crimes committed against Jews on UC Davis. This mural does not represent Davis, is offensive, and needs alterations to be made neutral or peaceful. As it stands, its a mural promoting genocide, racism, and the continuing harrassement of Davis real minorities. Users/AllBark

20101116 10:39:12 nbsp Am I mistaken or is that Ernesto Che Guevara prominently featured in the mural? As a matter of historical record, Che was a racist mass murdering Marxist revolutionary who once proclaimed, among many other outrageous comments, Hatred as the central element of our struggle! Hatred that is intransigent...hatred so violent that it propels a human being beyond his natural limitations, making him a violent and coldblooded killing machine...We reject any peaceful approach. Violence is inevitable. ... The victory of socialism is well worth millions of atomic victims. So, according to UCD, this sort of blood soaked hatred represents true diversity and the richness of its many cultures. Users/D.E.Putnam
