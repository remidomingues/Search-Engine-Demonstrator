20100907 23:41:44 nbsp Hi MWen, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Sorry you had such a bad experience with Executive Cleaners.  That sounds horrible.  I hope you manage to get things sorted out clotheswise for your trip, and that you enjoy the trip.  Good luck, and if you have a chance, please follow up with your comment and let us know what happens. Users/TomGarberson
