The Unitrans M Bus Line serves a large portion of South Davis, which contains one of the largest student populations in Davis. The line runs down B Street B St. to Richards Boulevard Richards Blvd to Cowell Boulevard Cowell. From there it makes a left turn on Drew Avenue looping around via Research Park Drive Research Park back to Cowell Blvd, then on Richards Blvd, to 1st, and on B St. to the MU Terminal. The Mline runs approximately every fifteen minutes during the day during regular service.

The Mline was created in summer of 2006 to help improve the ontime performance of the former WMU line, which most people considered to be notoriously late. The issue of lateness arises from the heavy passenger load, but more frequently from Downtown traffic, and congestion at the Richards Underpass, which the new Mline avoids by using 5th Street instead. Unitrans endeavors to be on time, but especially during the midday and afternoon hours, the traffic conditions make this virutally impossible.

Since this bus line covers the same area as the W, in South Davis the easy way to remember is that you just turn the M upsidedown to get a W.
