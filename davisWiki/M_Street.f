Address(M Street) runs for only two blocks between Duke Drive on the south side and 8th Street East Eighth Street on the north side, with a cute traffic circle where it crosses Colgate.

The street is exclusively residential until it meets East Eighth where the Davis Manor Center Orange Mall is on the right.

One notable house is on the outer corner of Duke and M, where at least 14 cats hang out, fed by the man who lives there. Another is the Robot Rocket Residence.
