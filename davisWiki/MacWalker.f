20100903 17:54:15 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mac, and welcome to the wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!   I noticed that you deleted all the comments off the entry about Theta Xi, and I was curious why.  It seems like theres quite a bit of information in there, so I restored it.  Was there a particular reason for the deletion? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
