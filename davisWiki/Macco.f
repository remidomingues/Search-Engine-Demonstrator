Youve already chosen your Importance of using your RealName username, so the next step would be to introduce yourself and make some positive contributions like adding business reviews, Photo Requests uploading photos, or adding to Seed Pages List pages that need more information.

20091020 22:54:39 nbsp I put the name in for you.  I knew who left the comment from the edit history which all wiki pages have.  There is absolutely no need to attack any user on the wiki in this manner.  You also might want to be careful from the tone of your two reviews it at least comes across as though you work for yoloberry though obviously I (and anyone else) might be misreading that.  As for the webcamera issue how do you know who is using it and for what purposes?  The only reason I was made aware of it was because several people through social networking groups brought it to my attention.  They use it to people watch which is not either of the two purposes you listed on the comment page and which I found to be disturbing.  I left my comment because I do very much so appreciate the quality of food but have no desire to be broadcasted to anyones computer and know others might feel the same way; in fact I have at least two friends who are now sadly going to yogurt shack instead to avoid the video camera.  Shouldnt a business know that they are potentially losing customers over this?  It is ultimately in their best interest.Users/OliviaY

20091020 23:16:09 nbsp Its okay, a lot of people dont know how the wiki works at first.  Just know that its not really appropriate to attack someone (and please note that in the interest of letting it die you did start it), and can come across especially poorly/suspect when you seem to be championing a single business.  Good luck with the wiki there are lots of resources to help out newbies. Users/OliviaY

20091020 23:43:20 nbsp Well yoloberry is lucky to have such militant customers.  Good luck with that. Users/OliviaY
