The Mace Ranch Community Park Habitat Area is an area in the Mace Ranch Park that has been set aside as a wild life habitat.  There are a plethora of rabbits living in the fenced in area, and almost always some Burrowing Owls as well.  Because the grass becomes too long for the Burrowing Owls during the spring time, sheep and goats are placed within the fence to mow the grasses.

Surrounding the area is a collection of Mace Ranch Community Tile Project community created tiles.

City of Davis information about the http://www.cityofdavis.org/pcs/openspace/livestock.cfm sheep and goats.

On April 30, 2011, the area received some landscaping attention from volunteers with Mormon Helping Hands.

20070315 11:37:09 nbsp Goats are domestic animals right? Some wildlife. It was more wild before the city ever did anything to it, such as declaring it a wildlife area. Mowing the grass with goats may be more wild than with riding lawnmowers, but that is nowhere near the sort of wilderness in a place like Modoc County. Meanwhile, grass grows in cracks in the sidewalk, cockroaches infest restaurants, and these are unrecognized as wildlife. Whether or not humans can be wild is still another issue (Is panhandling or graffitti on train cars wild?). Wild should mean uncontrolled and disorganized, and relative wilderness all depends on point of view. Users/NickSchmalenberger

 20070315 12:38:28 nbsp Yeah...  I was sort of happy they left at least some of the field for wildlife but was confused when they put in goats...  Im sure owls, thouh they may not like the long grass, have lived in it for years before we started mowing it with goats for them.  Of course, we should have never built the city at all if we wanted wildlife to exist everywhere.  The other attempts at open spaces in the city (see the ponds) are about equally controlled, watered, etc. Users/WesHardaker

20070315 13:24:42 nbsp I think the ponds have really been pretty successful. I think the one near me in West Davis is pretty nice looking and is useful for drainage too. I have often wanted to take a canoe around it. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070315 15:57:53 nbsp I like the ponds too, but theyre not natural landscaping as would exist if no one had anything to do with it (some are even watered by the city during the summer).  I actually have no idea what the current area in mace ranch is called...  maybe its not a wildlife area (which I guess is what you have an issue with?  If so, I think the name is mine).  BTW, if you like natural areas, do check out the grasslands park south on Mace.  Much more native habitat Users/WesHardaker
 Did I say I thought the ponds were natural? The ponds are certainly artificial I agree, but I think nice anyway. The sign on Mace Ranch Park says habitat area which I think is an even worse name. The whole area is zoned residential and I dont see much point in setting aside habitat for burrowing owls  or wildlife specifically. If it is set aside for some particular purpose how wild can it really be? What if, gasp, a nonnative species moved in? The city would hire all sorts of consultants to come in and manage everything to fit their fantasy. I think a better name for this sort of place would be Natural History Preserve to reflect the dynamic nature of wilderness. There should also be some sort of benefit to the city like the storm drainage in the ponds. I had an excellent discussion with Users/SteveDavison about the meaning of natural on Food/Natural. I have been to Yolo County Grasslands Regional Park too, I agree it is nice. Users/NickSchmalenberger
The burrowing owl is a threatened species and attempts have been made to list it as endangered in California. Thats the point in setting aside habitat for them. Second, I think the whole point about the area not being wild is cute and all, but really what is the point. You would be hard pressed to find any area in the lower 48 that isnt managed and therefore by your definition not wild, but yet some of that land has been set aside as reserves where particular species are likely to persist. Are the burrow owls likely to persist at Mace Ranch? I dont know, but it beats not trying. Actually, wasnt the reserve or park (or whatever you want to call it) a required part of the Mace Ranch development. Users/JimEvans

 20070315 22:25:51 nbsp I think all new development requires new land set aside for no development (covel village developers praised themselves for the land they set aside (which, actually, may have been above the minimum; I dont know)).  Actually, there is a lot more owls in other areas in mace ranch than just that little patch.  Say, for example, right where target is going to go. Users/WesHardaker

20070315 22:39:33 nbsp Sometimes I forget how unconventional my idea of wilderness actually is, so Im sorry. It includes rusted out cars and bird poop on statues but does not include burrowing owls living in artificial burrows maintained for them by people. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070315 23:04:34 nbsp I certainly havent heard of plastic burrows...  is there supposed to be plastic burrows in that area?  given our frog tunnel I guess I wouldnt be surprised. Users/WesHardaker
 Actually I dont know if they are plastic, I wrote that off the top of my head, but I read it off the picture of the sign Users/JasonAller uploaded on Mace Ranch Park...  There could be some affordable housing jokes about this. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110418 01:48:57 nbsp Saw some sheep there on Friday. Its my favorite sign that its spring time, seeing these farm animals basically right in my backyard. But, I have to say, I havent seen a burrowing owl here for a good few years. Maybe Im not looking hard enough... Or maybe they just up and left. And with that new development happening right next to this preserve, I cant see them coming back any time soon. I miss when this whole area was somewhat wild, not the planned and bland soccer fieldbaseball backstop dominated park it is now...  Users/CecilioPadilla

20130414 13:12:49 nbsp And now the City of Davis, that couldnt manage to maintain the proper environment for the Burrowing Owls, has determined that the area is now ready to be develop;ed into a passive recreation area per the approved master plan for the Mace Ranch Community Park (City of Davis Staff Report dated November 27, 2012).  Sounds to me like it was part of the master plan that the owls werent going to make it.  But you know, the ecominded Davis residents could feel good because we had a habitat area!  (Does it matter that it FAILED?)  We just shouldnt have trusted the city to manage it.  And Im curious how we can now develop the park according to the master plan using funding from the Verona Subdivision Development Agreementwhich didnt exist when the master plan was created.
