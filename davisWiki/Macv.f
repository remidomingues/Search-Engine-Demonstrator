From the use of the category tag, it seems like youve been on other wikis... you might want to read the Welcome to the Wiki/Wiki Enthusiast wiki enthusiast introduction.  Were friendly neighbors here, so you might want to also consider the importance of using your RealName, although thats just by tradition, not a hard rule.  Weve got a great little community here, and were glad to have you! Users/JabberWokky
