20100222 17:20:30 nbsp Hi Mad.Is.On, and welcome to the wiki!  Please check out that welcome page and also consider the importance of using your RealName.  It really does help in establishing an identity here and engaging with the community.  Also, I think that rather than the Social Websites page, the proper place to put your formspring link is here in your user page. Users/TomGarberson
