 

Mad Cows Racing Team is a Davis NonProfit Organizations nonprofit triathlon club which was something of an offspring of Dave Scotts triathlon fever. As a moving force and cheerleader for triathletes in Davis, Dave and his father brought a lot of athletes into the sport and even into Davis, as a training ground. Shortly after Verne Scott, Daves father and coach of the Dave Scott Triathlon Club, joined his son in Colorado in 2000, a small splinter group of local triathletes decided to form loosely as the Mad Cows; this seed group was led by Jennifer Aguilar, Steve Caswell and Damian Horstman. By 2002, Steve Larsen Steve and Carrie Larsen returned to Davis and, alongside Diana Hassel and Lydia DelisSchlosser, brought greater organization and enthusiasm to the group with the Mad Cows Triathlon Team.


From the Mad Cows site, Current pro triathletes residing and training in Davis include Jamima Iley, Diana Hassel, and Chad DeMasi, agent and athlete for the highly successful Team KINeSYS. These individuals are trained by Beth Zinkands former coach, Dr. Jan Elsbach, who is a Mad Cow himself and coaches many of the top athletes in Davis. With the advent of the Mad Cows Triathlon Team, Davis has become a nexus for the athletic and an excellent place to train for athletes of all abilities and ages.
