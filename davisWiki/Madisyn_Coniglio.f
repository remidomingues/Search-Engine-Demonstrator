Hi, My name is Madisyn Coniglio and I am an ASUCD Senate candidate under the LEAD slate for the Winter 2007 ASUCD Senate Elections. I am a third year majoring in Sociology with a minor in Political Science and I am originally from Bakersfield, CA in the Central Valley. I currently serve as the Vice Chair of the ASUCD Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission and was also a former ASUCD Internal Affairs Commission Internal Affairs Commissioner for two years. I was also an intern for former senator Nadeah Vali. The other areas of campus I have been involved in include being a volunteer for CalPIRG, the Student Recruitment and Retention Center (SRRC), the Cross Cultural Center (CCC), the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center (LGBTRC), and Picnic Day. I am also a proud sister of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority Incorporated, a Latinabased, Multicultural Organization dedicated to the empowerment of all womyn. One of the most fulfilling parts of my experience at UC Davis has been being a Peer Advising Counselor (PAC) for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) for the past year.

The issues I am focusing on in this campaign are:

  Minimum Progress
  Womyn of Color Conference and Student Initiated Outreach Conference
  Funding for Centers Reacing Out to Underrepresented and Underserved Communitites
