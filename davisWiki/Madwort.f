Madwort, or Sweet Alyssum (Lobularia maritima) is a hardy annual ground cover native to Southern Europe, sporting dense clusters of tiny snowwhite, pink or purple flowers. This delicate little plant blooms continuously spring through fall and selfseeds easily to return the following spring. The plant should be trimmed regularly to maintain a neat appearance. Somewhat drought tolerant and weather heat resistant, alyssum thrives in full sun to lightly dappled shade in most any soil
 perfect for Davis! Alyssum can be just as easily grown from seed as from starts, and grows up to 8 tall when left untamed. In full bloom, the plant gives off a slightly sweet aroma, requires little attention, and is attractive to Honeybees bees and butterflies & moths butterflies. The alyssums have been called madwort or healbite because of an old belief that they cured rabies. Alyssum is classified in the family Cruciferae (Brassicaceae), or cabbage family.
