Maggie Jacobs lived in Davis for thirteen years before she left for college and her parents, (Carol Brydolf and stepdad Tim Kehoe) picked up and ran away to Winters. Maggie considers herself fortunate for not being present because it meant she did not have to do any packing or heavy lifting. She, unlike many of her Graduates of the Davis Joint Unified School District graduating class of Davis Senior High Davis Senior Highschool, opted out of attending UC Davis because she believed, Davis is boring. Having lived in Winters for two summers now, she recants wholeheartedly any statement she has made regarding the activities offered in Davis as she finds them to be infinitely more stimulating than her current two places of residence, the aforementioned Winters (and all two blocks of its downtown) and Isla Vista, where drinking is a sport and sleeping is for pussies. That being said, Maggie would also like to say that her current home in Isla Vista is on the beach and she is not complaining.
Maggie has not yet accomplished anything spectacular of note yet in her life, but she hopes that shell contribute something cool to humanity before she dies in 2035 from an asteroid impact. Maggie Jacobs has never been cow tipping.
