20120910 18:25:50 nbsp I also found this place via a coupon book. Tried to contact them at both of the listed numbers, one of which seemed to go to a personal cell phone, but got no answer or return call from either. Ill go elsewhere or perhaps, thanks to the Wikis information on Carpet_Cleaning, do it myself. Users/harvardslacker
