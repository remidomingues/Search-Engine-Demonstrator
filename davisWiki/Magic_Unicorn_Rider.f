The Magic Unicorn Rider rides one of Daviss unique vehicles and can be seen zipping along streets and sidewalks all over downtown and on the UCD campus. Hell even go inside of places, such as the UCD MU Coffee House, cafes, restaurants, and bars. The Magic Unicorn Ride is a small electric vehicle equipped with a high fidelity music system, rainbow chasing lights, powerful electric motors, independent differential drive, and a highspeed precision motion control system that allows the vehicle to spin around on its center axis, stop on a dime, dance around, and is capable of rearing up like a real unicorn due to its rapid acceleration. Its battery system has a range of approximately 18 miles on a charge and powers the sound system and special effects lighting using high efficiency DCDC converters. It is designed and built by its rider, artist/engineer/music composer/technology historian Mark Chang, a UCD graduate and local resident. Construction was complete in August 2011.

20120423 17:13:06 nbsp what is the top speed? It looks like it books Users/StevenDaubert

20120424 05:03:35 nbsp Will, hopefully, be more mindful of the public, the law, and the safety of others along with his own in the future. Weaving in and out of traffic on G St., a rider fell off, was nearly hit by an oncoming car and then he just takes off... quirky, semigenius aside, seems to have no regard for others or for the law. Users/WesP

20120425 04:59:46 nbsp WesP, thank you for your concerns. I have a perfect safety record riding the magic unicorn out of approximately 60 hours total run time. The incident you mentioned on G Street involved a person who had been drinking alcohol and attempted to sit on the rear of the unicorn without my permission. The added weight caused the ride to tip rearward thus dumping the passenger. This occurred to the side of the road where bicycles normally ride, and I did turn around immediately to make sure that the passenger was OK (she was laughing). She was not nearly hit by an oncoming car. Rather, a car passed us slowly. I do not weave in and out of traffic when riding the unicorn. I follow all traffic rules, stopping at stop signs and signal lights, looking in all directions. I slow down considerably when giving rides to a few approved, sober passengers. The whole purpose of riding the unicorn is to share a magical experience with other people. They frequently tell me that Ive made their day or cheered them up. I am always completely sober and alert when riding it and have extremely accurate control of its motion at all times. The unicorn is meticulously maintained and safety checked before every ride. I just want to set the record straight that in no way am I simply gallavanting around with no regard for others or for the law. Users/MarkChang

20121119 07:42:03 nbsp After having seen this unicorn rider several more times, in addition to speaking with the driver (unbeknownst.to him),  I have found my earlier comment to be a one time fluke and applaud him for attempting to bring a small amount of joy to those he encounters. Users/WesP

20121119 17:14:40 nbsp An internet argument, resolved peacefully and cheerfully by happy agreement on all sides? Hooray; its a Thanksgiving miracle! Pumpkin pie and tiny trophies for everyone! Users/BarnabasTruman

20130921 14:20:23 nbsp It cracks me up how this thing can rear up on its hind legs like a real unicorn. Users/GenevaDuren
