Magic: The Gathering (colloquially Magic or MTG) is a cards collectible card game created by mathematics professor Richard Garfield and introduced in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. Magic is the first example of the modern collectible card game genre and still thrives today, with an estimated six million players in over seventy countries. Magic can be played by two or more players each using a deck of printed cards or a deck of virtual cards through the Internetbased Magic: The Gathering Online or thirdparty programs.

The game has created more then 51 base sets and 11 Core or beginner sets to date with more on the horizon and has increased sales from a mere $100,000 dollars (at the release of Alpha) to more than $650,000,000 annually and shows no signs of decreasing even in this poor worldwide economy.

Davis has a good sized following of Magic players who play at the local comic and game shops and has produced several protour players over the years, the most noticeable being Luis Scott Vargas (now a resident of Oakland, California.  It has also produced fine Judges for the DCI (the Wizards of the Coast oversight organization for the game) such as Riki Hiyashi, a level 3 judge and longtime Davis resident who continues to excel and grow personally and assists others in becoming judges and better players with his knowledge.

20100319 18:19:32 nbsp Do either of the gaming stores, or any players, in town buy Magic cards in bulk?  I have a couple thousand cards from 3rd, 4th, and 5th edition, and would like to sell them off.  A handful (quite literally) of my nicer rares were stolen back in high school, but there are still some solid cards. Users/TomGarberson
