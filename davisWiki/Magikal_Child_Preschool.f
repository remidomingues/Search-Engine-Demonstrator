20110404 12:59:16 nbsp My two children have been attending Magikal Child for over a year.  Heather and Filipe are a my childrens 2nd parents.  Heather is calm, peaceful, respectful, energetic, and a beautiful child at heart.  Filipe is a wonderful male role model in my childrens lives and we just love his gentle giantness, sweet playfulness with the babies, soccer skills with the older children, and musical skills.  Heather and Filipe speak spanish to the children and interact with each other in the same way.  I love coming by in the afternoon and hearing Filipe walking around with his guitar just playing to who ever is listening.  They are both successful in keeping the kids active all times of year with their large back yard and car track, or indoors hanging from the rafters of the ceiling (literally).  You can note my son in a perfect 2 year old table pose.  It is the perfect small environment for many fortunate children in Davis.  Thank you Heather and Filipe for all you have provided for and taught to my children.   Users/JenniferA

It is great to have them in a structured, yet not rigid environment where individual development is encouraged and fostered. We highly recommend this preschool and certainly feel fortunate to have found it. Users/Sarahlejeune
