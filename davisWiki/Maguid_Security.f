20100601 19:29:27 nbsp My frat president wants to know if you guys are licensed with the state? According to his findings no license shows up on a consumer affairs search for Maguid security or under the names; Maguid or Nunes? Talking with the consumers affairs people anyone supplying security must have a license to operate called a Patrol Operators license, plus those working for Maguid Security must have guard cards and be covered with workers compensation insurance. Please verify you have this so my frat can may be use you in the future.  Users/Bosco
 The website at maguid.net no longer belongs to them. The Wayback Machine displays a site archive from 2004, which contained a flash movie (intro.swf) that was not saved... not that it matters, since they claim to have started in 2006. Mark last logged into his http://www.myspace.com/businessstudent myspace last Wednesday, and the Companies section says that he works as a consultant from 2006 to present but heaven knows when that was last updated (hes not in Davis anymore, that part is fairly certain). Oh, and just for kicks, the address, 642 Lessley Place, is a http://maps.google.com/maps?hlen&q642+Lessley+Place&ieUTF8&hq&hnear642+Lessley+Pl,+Davis,+Yolo,+California+95616&glus&eiPsgFTMrBJoHNdyi_M8J&ved0CBMQ8gEwAA&ll38.551298,121.729534&spn0.000581,0.001206&th&z20&layerc&cbll38.551386,121.729807&panoidRNaOyDDHwIkbeuLaDfflQ&cbp12,102.36,,0,11.01 residential household. Seems to be a rented house, since the geography graduate group had a barbecue there in 2008. Bottom line? You should probably look somewhere else, because these guys dont seem to be around any more (if they ever were). Users/EBT
