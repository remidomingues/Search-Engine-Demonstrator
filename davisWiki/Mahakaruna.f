20071218 23:53:34 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Below are some links to the pages that youve created tonight:

  wiki:davis:Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center in Davis
  wiki:sacramento:Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center in Sacramento
  wiki:stocktonwiki:Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center in Stockton

I cleaned up the formatting on the Sacramento one a bit. One alternative to maintaining three separate pages would be to use interwiki redirects which allow a page to be held on one wiki and referenced from other wiki:wikispot wikis. Sticking {{{#redirect wiki:sacramento:Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center}}} by itself into a page on either the stocktonwiki or the davis wiki would point to the Sacramento wiki.

It may be that it makes sense to have complete entries on each wiki in which case you may want to use interwiki links on each of the pages to allow visitors to easily navigate to the other Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center pages. To make such a link just insert {{{wiki:davis:Wisdom Kadampa Buddhist Center}}}. Or just ask a question, there are many people who can help out around here. Users/JasonAller
