Also known as The Russian Lady, Mahins Alterations is best for your adventurous tailoring needs, like making a pair of pants one to two sizes larger, in the waist, seat and leg.  Mahin is Persian from Iran and speaks Farsi.


20070601 17:00:13 nbsp Whether she is referred to as the Russian Lady, she is Persian from Iran and speaks Farsi. She is an amazing seamstress and very quick. She can work wonders in a matter of minutes. I am a regular with her and I am so pleased with all she does. Not only is she downtown but shes so reasonable too. What more could you ask for? She makes me feel comfortable in my clothes! Users/NasMo

20070602 01:31:18 nbsp She altered my prom dress a couple years back, and we went back when my sisters wedding gown and my bridesmaids dress needed hemming. You can definitely trust this woman with a sewing machine, and her prices are quite good, like NasMo wrote.  Plus shes friendly. Users/MaryLieth

20070921 17:08:43 nbsp I brought her a formal bridesmaid dress 1 size too large to hem and alter the neckline.  She did a good job on the hem, but it cost me $50 for the full skirt.  The neckline was terrible and her hand sewing was shameful.  I didnt even realize how bad it was until I had to undo it all and do it myself.  If I would have looked more closely at her work, I would have asked for her to redo it or not charge me for the neckline ($15).  In all, I think she is probably talented, but I think she has so much business that she doesnt have enough time or even needs to do a better job.  She had a zillion bridesmaid dresses and uniforms in her office.  I would go to her for hemming, but definately nothing else.  I will try Hans next time. Users/lemurific

20071104 10:12:58 nbsp As a long time customer of Mahinâ€™s I was disturbed by what you have written.  I must ask if you could do it yourself and $50 to high a price, why did you take it to be altered?  If you had enough time to do it your self why not return it to her and ask her to redo it?  And I am not sure what a zillion is but if you mean she has a four foot rack in the corner with cloth hanging on it I would agree.  In the future I would advise you to develop some social skills so that next time you encounter an issue you can contact that individual and resolve it like an adult as oppose to going online and slandering some one behind there back.

  sometime, I have no idea what is wrong with you.  I am just reporting my experience with her.  I was happy with the hem job and reported the price I paid for it.  I had to redo the halter neckline, b/c the seams where much higher than my bust.  I waited to get my friends opinion, and all they all agreed that it looked wrong.  Once I took a look at her hand sewing at the neckline, I was shocked!  I cant believe that someone as skilled as she must be, would put out a product like that.  I have very minor sewing skills, but I was able to alter her alterations and handsew it better than her.  That being said, I would not have trusted myself to do the original alterations.  I would have gone back to her, if I was in the same state once I noticed the poor sew job.  The point is, it should have been sewn well the first time.  Had I fastened the halter myself in the store, I would have seen this and said something.  As far as what a zillion means  I would say she had at least 15 bridesmaid dress and about 20 uniforms.  Her racks were overflowing with clothes, which made my dress become a wrinkled mess.  That is my honest opinion.  I would go to her for a hem, nothing else.   Users/lemurific

20071129 21:45:29 nbsp I take my wifes clothes to Mahin all the time. She always does a wonderful job. Most of the time she is very busy, but always takes the time to have a quick chat. She has even hemmed and added patches to my sons karate uniform while we waited. Totally recommended. Ive gone to Hans in the past, but Mahin is the best. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20071204 17:44:17 nbsp Mahin beautifully altered the neckline of my Signature bridal gown on short notice almost six years ago and shes been altering my clothes (and my mothers) every since.  As a petite woman (5 ft, size 0/2) alterations are often necessary.  I find her prices reasonable for this area and she does a great job, whether its shortening my dress slacks and designer jeans or tailoring my shirts and blouses. She is a kind, compassionate woman who trust her completely.

Lemurics comments seem suspicious. Mahin has always insisted that I try everything on before leaving.  Its a nuisance, but she wants to be sure that I am happy with her work.  If lemuric wasnt willing to do that, then she has no right to complain after the fact. If there was a problem, Mahin would have addressed it then.  To not give someone the chance to address your concerns and, then, bash her work, seems very inconsiderate.  For this reason, I am posting both here and on yelp.

As for the price, whether the bridesmaids in lemurics posting got a good deal because they all went to the same place or there is more competition (near the garment district, perhaps?) doesnt matter.  Mahins pricing is reasonable for this area.  Maybe we should follow the words of Thumpers father in Bambi If you cant say anything nice, dont say nuthin at all!.

For me, Ill stay with the kindest, most dependable seamstress that were lucky to have downtown!

20071210 15:47:47 nbsp Ive taken her suits and pants for the past few years and have always been happy with her service.  Users/AndrewBianchi

20080125 09:53:33 nbsp Ugh!  I am not sure what makes my comment suspicious.  I am giving you my honest perspective.  What is the purpose of the wiki, if you arent free to share all your dealings with these places whether they are positive or negative.  I just so happened to have a negative experience with Mahin.  Maybe she was too busy  I dont know since I have never been back to her.  It is good that other people have had other positive experiences with her and it is clearly apparent that she has long time loyal customers.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Dont crucify me for sharing what happened to my poor dress. Users/lemurific

20090403 13:17:31 nbsp I have been taking my pants to her for the past 3 years and have received the best quality of work from here. Highly recommended!! Users/adamc328

20090719 13:14:59 nbsp I just want to update that I recently brought her a dress and several pants to be hemmed and she did a wonderful job.  She also altered a vintage coat for me and although I wish it costed less, she did a great job.  I am very glad I went back and gave her another try. Users/lemurific

20100222 21:02:21 nbsp Has anyone gone to Mahins for repairing torn jeans? Users/ARL589

20100413 18:10:01 nbsp Ive never gotten alterations before so I came to the wiki to see who was local and could do them. I decided to go with Mahins and I am very happy with the result. She took up a toolong dress that I will be wearing to a wedding and shortened the straps as well. I am overall very happy with the fit and I felt the price was reasonable.  Users/Babhari

20110516 15:57:24 nbsp Last year my wedding dress needed to be shortened, straps adjusted and the bust area taken out a bit.  Mahin did an amazing job with it and it was absolutely perfect!  I would trust her with anything and she works very quickly.   Users/NichoelM

20111104 14:41:27 nbsp Had her fix a very broken pair of leather gloves today  she did it very quickly and cheaply, and they are SO much better! Would definitely recommend her. Users/GretchenW

20120120 12:48:55 nbsp I needed some alterations done on a suit jacket before an interview. She did an excellent job and was very kind. Work was done within 2 days. Reasonably price, especially compared to new jacket. Ill definitely be returning for all my other tailoring needs. Users/Sar58

20120301 12:29:46 nbsp Mahin is amazing. I had a suit jacket that I needed taken in at the back and she performed an excellent job with the alteration and very quickly too. I will definitely visit her again if the need arises. Users/MarkTwain

20130702 09:05:33 nbsp Love this woman! Ive taken her bathing suits, sheets to be made into curtains, suits, dresses, pants and shorts that were too big after I lost weight, jackets, you name it! She always does a great job and is so friendly I like to visit for a bit. Her stories about her travels to Bali are fascinating, too.  Users/LaurieJLoving

20140202 11:44:21 nbsp Mahin is AMAZING!  Ive taken dresses as well as skirts to Mahin and have been really really impressed.  Ive needed her to basically downsize the entire dress/skirt, so take it apart at the side seams.  Each time Ive ended up with something that fits me perfectly.  I would recommend her for simple stuff (shes done great with hemming pants), but this is definitely the place to bring any more challenging stuff too! Users/daviscagradstudent
