Mail Drop Boxes are little blue thingamahoozits where you put your outgoing snail mail instead of going to the Post Office. Little magical gnomes then sneak inside, grab the mail, bless it, and then deliver it. Heres a list of all these seemingly camouflaged metal repositories.

The weight limit for items that go into the postbox is 13 oz.  Keep this in mind if you are trying to mail something other than a letter.

Please fill in more as you find them and note the pickup times as well!

 Private Mail Drop Boxes 

You can also drop your letter mail at many apartment complexes around Davis. Several of these complexes have the boxes out front by the street.  For instance, on 8th Street E. 8th St. near the corner of Chestnut youll find several of these. Typically, pickup for any given day is at the same time as delivery.


  I think Id be great to add pickup times as well.  Perhaps follow the lead of the Payphone Project and split up into multiple pages (pics would be neat too). Users/JevanGray Jevan
  This is amazing.  I was just looking for a page about this on the wiki and was about to create one when this very page popped to the top in Recent Changes. The wiki comes through again! Users/KenjiYamada
  I agree that a listing of drop times would be great! RickeyBooker
  Could these be added to the Davis Map? (Adding pay phones too would be good.)

20070527 19:42:58 nbsp Maybe splitting up the noncampus ones into area as well? Users/EddieKim
  20070710 I tried sorting them as best as I could. Please make corrections if I was wrong! Users/LillianChow

20071016 17:41:20 nbsp This is such a great resource!  Thanks for all those who contributed.  Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20080827 10:45:18 nbsp Beware that some of the mail drop boxes are out of service during the summer.  I went to the one in Tercero Housing Area and it was locked until the start of the fall semester.  (The one on LaRue and Bioletti was unlocked, however.) Also, the Memorial Union Post Office doesnt open until 10am over the summer. Users/tigerlady
