Majors are programs of study for Undergraduate Students.  These may be different from the actual University Departments departments, detailed on each Colleges Colleges page.  This list doesnt get updated too often; for an uptodate list, head over to the http://admissions.ucdavis.edu/academics/majors.cfm official UCD majors list.

The list of minors is slightly different from available majors.  Check out the list http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ucdwebcatalog/minors.html here.
