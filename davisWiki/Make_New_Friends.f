Chelsea Ransom Le is a credentialed K12 teacher and holds an M.A. in Education and B.A. in Child Development & Community Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz.  She taught grades K3 for six years and most recently taught Algebra at Davis High School.  Much of her inspiration for learning about children’s development came from teaching with colleagues at Applegate Nursery School in 1999. As a parent of a two year old she cares deeply about childrens opportunities for social development and networks available to new families.  Her hope is that Make New Friends will support other families who are seeking enriching experiences for their children and need the flexibility of part time care.


 Philosophy 
Children are born with an innate desire to learn and engage with the world around them.  Some of the many ways children learn are through play, observation, participation, engagement, exploration, experimentation, and reflection.  Early childhood educators at Make New Friends carefully observe and listen to each child, responding in ways that nurture their growth.
