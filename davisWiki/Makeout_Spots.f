Someone should map plot these! Users/MichelleAccurso

 I just felt the need to add that the Arboretum Gazebo is an awesome place to make out if you love to make out in places WHERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE!!!  Seriously, I NEVER go there, not even in the daytime, let alone in the light of a full moon...

  Tragic Events has no record of Tragic events/Suicides suicides in the gazebo.  The closest was Hugh Pat Patterson, who hung himself from an oak tree close by in Shields Grove.  If you know something that the wiki doesnt, please edit the page. Users/MattJurach

  I have never heard of anyone committing suicide in the Gazebo, and Im a townies townie! Users/JamesSchwab
