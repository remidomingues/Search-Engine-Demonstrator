Making Waves is a retail store for water sports supplies. They carry Triathlons triathlon suits, Swimming swim goggles, and competitive & recreational swimsuits.  It closed  temporarily, as it turns out  on June 15, 2007, and Super Suppers will be moving into its old location at 212 E Street in the E Street Plaza.  However, the owners apparently had a change of mind, and are now (as of July 12, 2007, or thereabouts) running the business out of Outdoor Davis.
