Malford H. Drummond (May 1, 18591932) was a Davis resident and coowner of Liggett and Drummonds General Store.  Born to Lewis Craig Drummond and Eliza Reid, Malford was raised on a farm near Davis and attended public schools there.  He later studied at Atkins Business College in Sacramento.  He started his career in hardware sales alongside E.W. Brown, the former business partner of his deceased father.  However, Drummond soon broke away from this venture and established the hardware and grocery store with Liggett.

In 1884, Drummond married Eliza Callaway and they had one son, Lester.  Tragically, Eliza died after being thrown from a carriage, just over a year from the date of their marriage.  After this loss, Drummond found life in Davis to be very painful as he was constantly reminded of his wifes death. Two years later, he moved on to Fresno, and later the Sandwich Islands.
