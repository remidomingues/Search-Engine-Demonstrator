Mall rats and others may be interested to know that our local malls are:

 In Davis 
  University Mall  barely qualifies as a mall but it is in Davis (might be called a stripmall by some) It used to have a single contiguous walkway down the center and qualified better as a mall. You can no longer walk through the interior of the mall from one end to the other since Forever 21 took over the west side entrance of the mall.
