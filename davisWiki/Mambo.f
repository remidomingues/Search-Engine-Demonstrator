Mambos this awesome little dogs dude who happens to hang around Users/JoePomidor a lot.
He was found in downtown Sacramento Sac, taken to Petco, Police Department Trading Cards traded hands there, and Hangovers eventually ended up in Joes Temescal Apartments apartment. He couldnt send him to the Yolo County Animal Shelter shelters, so he adopted him. He also spends time with his Siamese Fighting Fish sparring partner, Rufus.
Although Mambos parents are completely unknown, we think he is part Border Collie, and the rest is speculation.
