The ManKind Project in Davis

The ManKind ProjectÂ® (MKP) has three weekly Davis groups (called IGroups; short for Integration Groups). They also man an MKP educational booth at the UC Davis Whole Earth Festival and hold yearly open house events. Contact the email above to get specifics.

An MKP IGroup is a group of men who meet to communicate and connect with each other on a deep level. They strive to listen to each other fully and to recognize and value the emotional nuances in each individuals expressions. Members encourage and remind each other to keep committed to the important things in life. The group encourages mutual feedback and the exploration of each others goals and passions. They attempt to cultivate an atmosphere of absolute but benevolent honesty, in which individuals can benefit from having their blind spots revealed through frank appraisals. The hope is that everyone will come away from the meetings with a better sense of their own potential and the steps needed to actualize it in their own lives.

A statement from someone affiliated with the groups:
We dont need to sit around and tell each other Were fine the way we are. Nor do we need to beat ourselves up for our real and imagined shortcomings. What mens work asks us to do is tell our real stories. It asks us to be honest about the source of the pressures and anxieties so many of us feel and too few of us articulate. And once weve laid the truth out on the table, mens work invites us to support each other in taking positive action to change our lives and to change the world in which we live. But we cant move directly to the action without first telling each other the truth. And at its core, the goal of all mens work is to help men do just that.  http://hugoboy.typepad.com/hugo_schwyzer/2006/03/last_night_i_wa.html Hugo Schwyzer
