I dont recommend the salmon.  It had lots of teeny little bones.  Ive heard good things from some people about other things they sell though.  Users/MarieHuynh

The older dude that runs this place is really friendly. The ribs are good, the spicy food is truly spicy, but Id avoid the chicken dishes.  Users/VictorZapanta
  Why would you avoid the chicken dishes?  Users/JackHaskel
  Ive had nothing but good luck with the chicken. Especially good (for the price) is the teriyaki chicken lunch special  its only $4 or so and is quite tasty!  Users/KenNeville
  I just tried their chicken teriyaki dish, pretty good for the price, but the salad that came with it was quite boring, consisting of iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots, and um... this funky creamy dressing. I also had their eel sushi roll, which was pretty good.  This place is decent, and I might come back to it. Users/KarlMogel
  At any Korean place I try to avoid the chicken because it just doesnt seem... Korean to me. Korean places, especially the BBQ, should be all about the beef and pork. Korean places should also be all about the spicy fish stews. Except for chicken teriyaki, which is from the Japanese side of the shop. Users/IrenePark

20050706 17:55:54 nbsp Try the bibimbap or the seafood tofu stew... Quick and delicious Users/EricWecker

20050804 02:11:39 nbsp The place is pretty good, although they dont have the chicken teriyaki to go anymore, you have to order one of the regular things on the menu Users/HarrisonNguyen

20050906 11:47:21 nbsp My girlfriend and I tried this place once.  I dont remember exactly what either of us got, but I had some dish with pork and she had some dish with chicken.  Neither of us could come close to finishing.  It was easily the worst food ever created.  To put my comments in perspective, you should know that I often eat food out of dumpsters. Users/NikolaiBraun

  Well, that explains it. Youre used to food out of dumpsters, this isnt going to have the extra flavouring youre used to. |D Users/JeffreyNonken

20050910 13:41:05 nbsp Users/BlancheNonken and I ate here yesterday. She got the California rolls and some kimchi, I got the Teryaki chicken lunch with pot stickers. I have to say we both enjoyed the food. The teryaki chicken was about average, I liked the pot stickers. The salad was as Users/KarlMogel described, but I liked it. Maybe I wasnt expecting my salad to be exciting? It would be more nutritious with something other than iceberg. The dressing was sweet, not bad. They start you out with Miso soup before you order; the soup was pretty good. I plan to go back and try some other dishes. Users/JeffreyNonken

20050913 14:13:14 nbsp Ate there twice recently.  The Bimbimbap was good, but the beef in the Bulgogi was really weirdtasting, and we didnt finish it.  I may or may not go back. Users/HarrySpanglet

20050922 11:08:49 nbsp I went there for the first time last night and had the Hot Night Roll (crab, spicy tuna, spicy sauce, etc.) and it was really tasty. It had bits of tempura on top, which brought it up to like a 9 out of 10. Users/SharonZimmerman

20051013 17:06:42 nbsp I thought their Eel Rice bowls are really good...like Little Tokyo material but I wish they gave you more rice... Users/CarlosOverstreet

20060108 20:15:00 nbsp Its not too bad... I guess Ive been spoiled by eating in Koreatown in LA, but otherwise the foods decent.  If spicy isnt an issue, the Kimchi Chigae is good.  Its a pretty general restaurant, so if you go in there without that many expectations itll definitely satisfy you. Users/AlexKim

20060220 02:50:40 nbsp The kalbi (barbecued ribs) are really good.  No complaints about the bulgogi, though Ive gotten it kinda dry a few times.  Probably the only choice for Korean food in a thirty mile radius around Davis. Users/CurtisLim

20060511 02:08:03 nbsp For the prices, I dont think they give enough...I always come out of there feeling a bit hungry.  Im not satisfied but it usually does it... Users/ChrisLee

20060714 07:01:32 nbsp The korean food here isnt spicy enough Users/KillerBobo

20060729 17:57:09 nbsp The food is good, the short ribs, bibimbap and some of the specialty rolls especially. The people here are friendly (if occasionally overwhelmed).  Ive had a number of large get togethers here, and everything has always gone well.Users/MisterProfessor

20060729 20:18:18 nbsp Mmm... bim bim bap. Pretty good food but I wouldnt go here for the sushi. The owners so nice too. Users/LiRic

20060801 18:39:52 nbsp its impossible to get bibimbap and kimchee tofu stew wrong. a davis staple for me. Users/EmilyTung

20060802 02:21:09 nbsp Do they make jap chae? Users/JudithTruman

20060803 20:36:40 nbsp I really like the food here. Its good considering its Korean fast food. The owner is really nice and Ive generally had good service here. Users/ArielaHaro

20060909 22:20:25 nbsp I love the Udon (makes my heart happy and body warm, if needed) and the rolls. Granted, I wont go for the sushi, but its still pretty good. The waitress is always really nice and happy, which makes it more enjoyable.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20061213 21:23:57 nbsp The portions here are great with Miso and Salad included.  The food isnt spectacular, but at the price and the quantity it is worth it.  I do however recommend avoiding the salad dressing.  That stuff looked and tasted very strange (not food poisoning strange, just gross strange) Users/JohnHumperdinkle

20070108 18:04:03 nbsp I just love the food here. The chicken is great but when my sister and I come here once a week we always get the sushi. We are big sushi fans and are very very picky about our fish. Most of the rolls and sushi here are to our liking. Our favorites are the Alaska roll, which is california with raw salmon, the Rainbow roll which has Toro(Tuna),Hamachi (Yellowtail), Saki (Salmon) and other assorted fish on top with cucumber and avacado inside, and the philly roll( salmon and chremcheese)  I am a big fan of the tempura shrimp rolls as well!!  The prices are awesome for good sushi too! And takeout does not takelong at all! Users/ClaireGorman

20070422 19:13:23 nbsp Came here today because ive been craving korean bbq. Ordered spicy pork and bbq beef. Pork was decently spicy but the bbq beef tasted different than what i am used to. It would say this place is average in taste but quantity is a bit small. It would be better if they tried to create a full korean bbq restaurant instead of korean/japanese. If they had more variety of korean food then i would come here more often. (There are too many japanese restaurants in davis...) Users/BrandonToo

20070424 19:02:44 nbsp This place is bomb, and the service is awesome!  Also, the best chicken yaki in town, if you add extra yaki and sesame seeds. Users/klmz

20070502 13:18:44 nbsp for being called korean, this place isnt very korean. i had to ask for kimchi and my bibimbap was very...well...westernized. im not trying to knock any kind of quality here but the authenticity is nil. Users/MiranPark

20070502 20:36:58 nbsp The bimimbap in a clay pot was excellent, although next time I wouldnt bother with the beef (there wasnt much of it, and it wasnt great quality), and instead would go for the tofu. The vegetable teryaki makes an excellent light and healthy dish: both tofu and veggies are steamed, not fried. Yum! Users/CovertProfessor

20070522 17:13:46 nbsp I wanted to check this place out and ordered the soba noodles with some weird carrot things. that was pretty yucky. my friend had the teriyaki chicken and that was pretty good. went back because the people were really nice and tried something different. I had some kind of hot seafood noodle and that was pretty good. i cant say anything about being authentic korean, but i liked it. Users/AeSaeteurn

20070806 09:58:11 nbsp Im not sure what some of the people commenting here are complaining about.  I came here last night with a special guest on a hunch, and it would be an understatement to say the place greatly exceeded my expectations.  Whether the food is genuine Korean or westernized I really dont know and dont care since it was very fresh (just before closing Sunday eveningthe least likely time I would think restaurant food to taste noticably fresh), tasty, reasonably priced, was promptly served, and came in goodsized portions.  Everyone working there was very nice and attentive, too.  I wouldnt need to think twice about coming back to this place, and Im sure itll be soon at that.  Excellent; Id highly recommend! Users/MichaelKeteltas

 when you grow up around a certain kind of food and culture its nice to be able to get a taste of homestyle cooking that is authentic and consistent to true tastes as would be traditionally cooked. have you ever had food cravings for a certain type of food? i was just trying to say that to me, someone who is used to traditional korean food the way they make it in korea (and generally in korean restaurants in california esp. in the bay area) its a sore disappointment to not be able to get the taste of home that i crave in korean food, especially since ive found it extremely hard to cook and manipulate food to the same flavors when it comes to korean food. additionally the food i received was not fresh, the bulgogi looked and tasted like it had been reheated after being cooked way earlier whereas traditional bulgogi is bbqed or panfried right before serving. this is the type of thing i was trying to remark on when i said westernized. bibimbap without gosari or doragi or some other kind of mountain vegetable is just not bibimbap to me. Users/MiranPark

 What?! No doragi?! Aww thats sad. Thats my favorite part of bibimpap. Users/AlisaKim

20070906 19:36:22 nbsp The soon doo boo (spicy tofu stew) was really good, its what i always get. The bugolgi is ok, and the kalbee is good, but they dont have any sides at all. They give you a little kimchee and beansprouts sometimes, but you have to ask for it. Most Korean places, including the Manna in SF and LA give you assloads of sides, at least 10.

Other than that, no real complaints, good enough to satisfy my Korean urges. Korean food urges. Users/Kafani

20071012 13:34:59 nbsp I come here all the time and although the service is slow (due to only 2 servers max), the food is very good. I love the stone pot bibimbap and the teriaki chicken. If you mix the teriaki with the white salad sauce, its heavenly. Owner is pretty nice too. Users/Rbbie2x

20071028 07:06:06 nbsp Does anyone know if they serve jjajang myun here? Users/NicoleBush

 not that i know of, the first and last time i was there it definitely was not on the menu. a poor substitute for real, fresh jajang myun can be had in ramenstyle package form at kims mart for desperate cravings.Users/MiranPark

20071122 00:59:57 nbsp The seafood tofu stew is great. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20071211 22:43:49 nbsp I tried a sashimi salad type dish, i forget the name now, it was excellent.  sashimi served over rice with lettuce, cucumber, and apples.  the flavors mixed very well and the food tasted very fresh.  the service was friendly and prompt despite there being several customers.  i would recommend Manna to friends.  Users/Chantal

20080427 19:08:25 nbsp I love the boiled dumplings!

I had the nicest experience there this evening  Walked in to place an order, and they were out of soba.  The guy at the register selected a great alternate dish based on my preferences, and my order was ready in five minutes. Users/Casey

20080516 13:55:20 nbsp I love this place. The food is excellent. Usually get tempura or the shimp tempura roll. All of the appetizers are great also. The older woman (owner?) is so CUTE! She is so nice and always smiling. Last time I went there she was wearing leopard pants with a hot pink sweater and a leopard scarf....adorable lady. All of the waiters are up on the menu, so nice to be able to ask what the difference is between the items. A+ for this place. FAVORITE restaurant in Davis.  Users/tgdavis

20080705 14:43:43 nbsp I always go to Manna because its the only Korean Restaurant in Davis (Oshio is total crap). The food here is far from authentic and disappointing. Their soondooboo is good and so is their kalbi but it is a step down from a real korean restaurant. They also dont give enough panchan (side dishes) and thelady is quite awkward and stingy. Most korean places will refill your sidedishes multiple times but at Manna the lady complains. She also doesnt like it if you more than one person uses the cards and she only allows checks to be split two ways. Just as most Asian Restaurants in Davis...disappointing. Users/islandboy12

20080927 18:11:52 nbsp I went there two days back and I must say the restaurant is just decent. The kalbi was pretty yummy while the bulgogi seemed a bit bland. It seems they didnt leave it in soy sauce long as they should have.. The bibimbap was decent but i think they didnt cook it enough to get crispy hard rice on the bottom. (Which is the reason why we eat dol sot bibimbap no??) The  I was rather disappointed with the number of side dishes.. Only Kimchi and bean sprouts for a 10 dollar meal. Would appreciate it if there were at least 3 side dishes.. is that too much to ask?

The lady at the counter seemed kind. Service was decent. Would definitely go there again. Users/alexlee333

20081008 20:07:56 nbsp dude.. this place sucks..  Users/tahoeian

20081029 16:56:59 nbsp I ordered the Sea Food Tofu Stew for $8.99. It was not that much bigger than a small rice bowl with some tofu in it with virtually no seafood, at least the amount was so dismal that it may as well be considered not there. It was for me a total rip off. I left feeling unsatisfied and hungry. For $9.00, I could might as well buy a roast duck for Ding How that will last me for two meals. Users/supernova365

20081216 20:24:13 nbsp i love eating at this place. i always get the bbq short ribs and my bf always gets the bibimbap. the lady there is really nice, always smiling and offering free candy to the little ones. i brought another friend with us the last time. she thought the food was just okay and pretty much lost her appetite when she pulled a piece of hair out that had been tangled in her pork. it was a good 10 inches. but im sure ill continue to come here Users/skinnyfatgirl

20090106 11:21:00 nbsp I absolutely love this restaurant  its by far my favorite place to eat in Davis, and I go at least once a week (and Id go there all the time if I could).  Ive had good experiences with their salmon teriyaki and their bibimbap with tofu, but I always get their Soon Doo Boo (soft tofu stew) with kimchi.  It tastes wonderful on a cold day in Davis, and even though I do wish there were more side dishes Im content with the bean sprouts and the kimchi that they do provide.  Service can be slow when its busy, but Ive only seen one waiter/waitress working at any given time  and the wait has never truly bothered me.  On the contrary, I find that theyre usually very fast with their service, and Ive never had a bad experience with an employee or management.  The lady who presumably owns Manna is a really kind person, and I always see her chatting up customers.  The atmosphere is laidback and aesthetically pleasing.  Their menus are well organized and easy to understand (numbers are provided for each item for those unfamiliar with the pronunciations).   Users/hwarpeha

20090109 10:52:40 nbsp Great experience! My wife and I went for dinner last night and cant believe all the delicious food we got for the price. Incredibly affordable and incredibly tasty! Users/condemned2bfree

20090217 22:25:42 nbsp SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good, great staff, and great teriyaki! Users/simplyg00d

20090510 15:27:00 nbsp I got really excited the first time I saw it because I really missed korean food from LA. But when i went there, it made me sad. I never went back. I had the soon doo boo and the bulgogi. The soon doo boo was just edible (a little bit more watery than Im used to) but the bulgogi just tasted strange. Users/Michelleshueh

20090706 23:23:52 nbsp This place is alright... I just come here to satisfy my Korean food cravings. Better than nothing. Ive had their bibimbap, which in my opinion, isnt a big enough portion for me. Then again, I eat a lot. Manna isnt that spectacular, but its decent. Users/JanetHung

  Bibimbap is like tacos or sourdough toast, you can never get full from them. Users/hankim

20090719 20:14:39 nbsp I think the food is pretty good. Not as good as the stuff you can find in the Bay, but it will satisfy a craving. I like that you get free refills on white rice if you ask. Im guessing not a lot of people ask for it, thinking they get charged, but its free! Users/AmyTrinh

20091214 21:44:40 nbsp The food is definitely not the best out there (Ive tried the chicken teriyaki and various sushi rolls) but it is decently priced and quite flavorful. The portions are just right. The space is small and cozy which I guess is why they dont have many waiters. Ill probably come here again in the future. Users/sjpacheco

20100331 00:19:27 nbsp This place is too expensive and the mixed plate i got was only average. The chicken katsu tasted exactly like the chicken katsu at a hawaiian bbq fast food place, only it cost more than 10 bucks after tip. I probably wont go back unless someone else is payin. Users/tneeley

20100613 00:15:08 nbsp i only go here when i crave korean food but honestly, i dont find anything korean about this place. i really think they dumbed the spiciness level down for those you cant handle it...i told the waiter to make my soondubu deadly spicy and...it really disappointed me. their quantity is also VERY low: i really dont think anything on the menu can fill me up. my favorite is possibly the stone pot bibimbap but i havent gone enough to verify.

one thing i love about this place though: ask and you shall receive ;) Users/binladen
  What does that mean? users/arwennhold
   Apparently, it doesnt mean that if you ask for the food to be spicy, you will receive spicy food.  (I like their stone pot bibimbap, for what it is worth).   Users/CovertProfessor

20100618 14:31:28 nbsp I just got a salmon teriyaki lunch special togo.  It was $8.99 and was supposed to come with salad, rice and california rollsI didnt notice until I opened it later at work, but they completely forgot the california rolls and the salmon is tiny...  maybe Ill go back and see if they give me my sushi.  Not happy, not much of a salad and rice person. Users/Saffry

20100624 12:22:23 nbsp Went here twice so far. First time I ordered the bulgogi (Korean barbecued beef) meal thinking it would not exceed ten dollars (I was looking at the menu on the wall) and was surprised it cost about $14. The meat was a little chewy but decent and they gave plenty of food so I did not feel completely ripped off and bulgogi is usually pricey at Korean restaurants anyway. The second time I ordered the bibimbap (rice with egg, vegetables, and bulgogi). Pretty good and much better than the bowl of oil that I tried at Davis Oshio Cafe. Will be back to try the jajangmyun at some point. This place is a bit pricey but around the price of most Korean restaurants I have been to. Need more data to determine if this will become one of my favorite restaurants. Users/hankim

20100823 19:29:38 nbsp I went here for lunch with my uncle from the east coast.  I had the Bimbimbop and he had some sort of black noodle dish.  The Bimbimbop was alright, but nothing extraordinary.  My uncle, an adventurous eater, couldnt finish his plate.  We also ordered a dragon roll  the eel was extremely fishy, we didnt finish that either.  Furthermore, with no more than two other tables eating, it took forever for our food to arrive.  When we asked if our food was started (20 minutes after we ordered), they gave us a grunt for an answer.  Not too friendly from our personal experience, and the food wasnt worth the price even if the portions are large. Users/KurtSassenrath
  Black noodle dish was probably the jajangmyun. Users/hankim

20100920 05:37:56 nbsp I always come here for their spicy chicken dish which is amazing. It comes with tons of chicken (which is perfect for me because I am a carnivore.) The food of course is not spicy to me at all because my tolerance for spicy is very high. Most people I know say its decently spicy for them. Anywho, the price for the spicy chicken dish is very reasonable. Going at about $7.99 and even cheaper during lunch hours, what more could I ask for? It comes with rice and a very delectable salad. During lunch you get extra options like gyoza or California rolls.

My Korean peers frequently bash on this place for a multitude of reasons. But realistically, if you want Korean food in Davis there are really only two restaurants. So if you need a Korean morsel fix, choices are limited. Out of the possible choices, Id say Manna is the best one. They could offer a lot more though. At other Korean restaurants they often offer numerous side dishes with almost all orders. So again, Im not saying its the best Korean food ever. But in terms of what we have in Davis, its decent.

The customer service here is awesome though. They are very friendly, and they check on you appropriately. Users/ThUn

20101025 15:04:50 nbsp Ive always liked their deep fried tofu teriyaki. Their regular (nondeep fried) tofu teriyaki comes with steamed vegetables, but the deepfried does not. For some reason, every time I order the deep fried tofu, and ask for steamed vegetables on the side, the workers act like its a huge deal. Basically, they dont like to make substitutions. They seem stingy and uninviting.  Users/Kristina86

20101215 00:45:08 nbsp Wow. They closed? Its been years since I ate here but back in 06  07 I used to grab their unagi rice bowls all the time for lunch.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20101231 11:21:21 nbsp Well, I guess theyre not closed. Why would the addition of a new item require grand opening sign... Users/ThanhVu
     Im guessing they changed ownership. Seen it happen before, but agree that its confusing.  Users/ScottMeehleib
