Slide Hill Park is famous for its large cement slide and a pool complex. The slide used to have two large concrete humps in it that broke up the middle into three distinct lanes. However, too many children would get hurt, so they took them out. The slide and nearby rocks are popular with a couple of BMX bikers who live nearby. Also, in the 1990s a kid with a heart condition went down the slide on a bicycle, had a heart attack halfway down, and died. In other words, some caution is occasionally advisable.

The park is also notable as it is outside of the Open Container Ordinance area. For that reason it is a popular spot for Sloshball. Hooligans playing get drunk in the park should be respectful of the other park users. This is a popular park for families and kids. It is also home to the Girl Scouts.  Also within the park is the Watchman ï¼ƒ8 Watchman #8 art piece.

Catapult At The Park
The park is also occasionally host to Davis largest trebuchet(a type of catapult, see Hurlers) owned by Users/DevinCastellucci and Users/MasonMurray.

It is also where Wiki BBQ Summer 2007 Wiki BBQs have been held.

The coniferous trees of this park attract some unique species of Little Brown Birds Songbirds, mostly during spring. Also look for Owls roosting in the trees during the day. Indeed, the park is a wellknown spot for Birds and Bird Watching.

Slide Hill Park, also known as Manor Park, shouldnt be confused with West Manor Park. Slide Hill Park is routinely patrolled at night by the Davis Police Department. They can be seen with their spotlights driving on the parks bike paths.

20070414 15:10:33 nbsp I have always known this as Slide Hill Park with Manor Pool, never Manor Park.  Can anyone point to anything official saying Manor Park?  I grew up here, so its bothering me. Users/EdHenn
 Im seeing it both ways on the City website. Here: http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/facility/manorpool.cfm and http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/facility/details.cfm?typePark say Slide Hill Park but http://www.city.davis.ca.us/gis/maplibrary/maps/az%20map.pdf says 33 Slide Hill (Manor Park). On this page: http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pw/CIP/cip.cfm?cipB0717A471ECA4D89BDE9AFD02B664A47 , if you click pictures it says Overhead view of Manor Park and the Manor Pool complex. Slide Hill seems to be more common by the Department of Parks and Recreation, while Manor Park is maybe used more by the Deparment of Public Works? Users/NickSchmalenberger

I work for Parks and Community Services (soon to be split into two separate departments actually) and its always Slide Hill when referring to the Park. The pool is Manor Pool, it could be that PW uses Manor to refer to it. All advertising as far as camps etc always uses Slide Hill both internally and externally. Im just speaking anecdotally. Peace

20080506 14:40:43 nbsp Guys the new park supervisors have banned Devin from using his trebuchet. Please help him by sending letters to the Slide Hill Park supervisors.

20080727 13:22:50 nbsp I grew up and still live near this park. My childhood evolved in this park, be it at the pool or one of the play structures. We went there so often, in fact, that when my grandmother died we placed her memorial in it. But yeah, its always been Slide Hill Park, with Manor Pool residing in it. Havent been to the pool since the remodel. Anyone know if its any good? Users/Anja

20080727 16:02:59 nbsp Its always been Slide Hill Park, with Manor Pool for me and my family Users/StevenDaubert

20080727 16:03:18 nbsp and my buddy notices my typing this and concurs wholeheartedly, so I thought I would throw that in... Users/StevenDaubert

20090802 15:42:52 nbsp Flashblack. We used to go here as kids. The kid that died was my bestfriends cousin. Ive always had a strange fear of the place since then. Users/CarlosBarahona

20100402 13:22:03 nbsp The slide is super fun. I honestly think this place is slightly haunted so dont go at night. Users/RebeccaCho

20110510 01:51:31 nbsp I live in the only house that would ever complain about noise at slide hill.  My fiancees family had lived here for years, we love the fact that it is such a staple of davis may they never remove it! Side note over 10 people have died within 100 yrds of my house we should get one of the most haunted spots it davis awards or something. Users/TravisMartin

20110804 17:43:03 nbsp Back in the day (late 70s), the slide was FAST.  Its since been made more coarse, less slick, MUCH slower.  Kids used to ride down on wax paper, which (I guess) made the ride even faster.  In lieu of that, a good piece of cardboard would do the trick.  Kids would get seriously skinned up on there, but no one seemed to care (except maybe the parents)... it was great fun.  Also, there used to be 2 humps in the middle of the slide... I guess the idea was to create lanes for kids to confirm too, but all they really did was send you flying (or bouncing) off on to the hard, coarse concrete sides of the slide.  Of course as a kid, the slide seemed HUGE.  Still, good for a whole day of fun, before the days of the Atari 2600 started sending kids inside to play. Users/OldDavis73
