 Wiki mapping 
Pages in the wiki can be mapped.  See wiki:wikispot:Help with Maps on the Wiki Spot hub for instructions on mapping pages.  When a page has been given a map location a Map icon will appear on the page.  Click it to bring up a map of the pages location along with locations of nearby places.

 General Davis map information 

The city of Davis has maintained a rather extensive collection of useful and interesting maps over at their http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/ Geographic Information System site.  The http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/library/ downloadable map layers page is especially useful for the wiki.  You can download .zip files containing layer files, which you can view with:
  http://www.esri.com/software/arcexplorer/download.html free GIS software from ESRI  Windows only :(
  http://qgis.org Free open source GIS software (like the wiki)  Windows, Mac & Linux
These files contain a lot of useful data.  For instance: the parks file contains the locations/shapes of all the parks, size of all the parks, and their names.

Among the most interesting are the 2005 aerial photos, which you can http://www2.dcn.org/orgs/orthophotos/ download individually in high resolution or http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/2003aerial browse seamlessly using flash.

The http://www.cityofdavis.org/gis/unitrans Unitrans route map is likely the most useful to students, though.

The city also has a http://www.city.davis.ca.us/gis/bikemap.pdf bike map available in PDF form. This map shows Bike Paths bike paths in addition to city streets.

OpenStreetMap has very good coverage of Davis, and you can improve it too.
