20060908 16:11:48 nbsp Can anyone figure out a date for the new GoogleMap satellite image?  I can see that the new parking structure isnt completed yet, and the new TAPS building isnt started yet.  Jagged Tree is still there. Users/MattJurach

20061005 21:15:48 nbsp Hard copies of the city bike map are available at the visitor info booth at the north parking structure.  They are not available at: MU Info Desk, Bike Barn, or TAPS even though they all say the other one has them.  I believe the chamber of commerce has them as well, if you can find that place.
