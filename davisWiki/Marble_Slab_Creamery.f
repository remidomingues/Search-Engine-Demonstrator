This ice cream shop closed around 20070930 and was replaced by another one named Davis Creamery.

This ice cream parlor serves fresh, premium ice cream in plastic tumblers. Similar to Cold Stone Creamery, they offer mixins, items that are mashed into the ice cream when you order.  That similarity causes them to often be compared. They both make the ice cream and waffle products in the store, (unlike  BaskinRobbins and Ben & Jerrys where the ice cream is premade and delivered from elsewhere) and mix the ice cream on a frozen stone, but thats where the similarities end.  Marble Slab opened five years earlierFootnote(According to their websites, http://www.marbleslab.com/story.htm marble slab started in 1983, and http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/secondary/history1.asp cold stone started in 1988.), Cold Stone now has over 1200 stores, and the Marble Slab chain has 267 storesFootnote(According to their website 20060308).

The prices are comparable to Cold Stone.  The smallest size costs 2.99 (no mixin included, but some servers let that rule slide) (Cold Stone is $3.29 including the mixin), 3.20 for original (no mixin), 3.79 with one mixin, 4.38 for 2 mixin, 4.50 for big dipper (includes 1.5 mixin though many servers give 2). Toppings are 60 cents extra if you want more than what is included. If you are interested in ordering a customizable icecream cake be prepared to order it at least 48 hours in advance to allow the staff to make the icecream.

Marble Slab doesnt take American express anymore, but they do accept Visa and Mastercard as well as debit card. The kids cup is like 2 scoops, 2.53 scoops for original cup, 6 scoops for a big dipper, 10 for a pint.

The Big Dipper and Quart size is the best value. For only a $1 extra you can double the pint size ($5.19) to a quart ($6.19).

The Davis store has Wild Wednesdays: Wednesdays, 6PM9PM, buy one original size w/ 1 mixin and get one free.

Currently Marbleslab Creamery is not giving out gift certificates anymore as they are transitioning towards gift cards but they still accept gift certificates.

They recently had a change in management as of June/July 2006, the owner is Lucy who typically works during the weekdays when the store opens until 34pm. The store is basically student run and they try their best to offer great service.

The Banana ice cream shake is awesome.

20050707 09:57:35 nbsp  When Ive gone, the  frozen yogurt machine has always been broken or no in service. good ice cream but HIGH prices. Id rather go to rite aid and get ice cream for 1.00 per scoop! Users/SiennaGrass

20050803 20:14:12 nbsp Strawberry ice cream with a banana mixin is my favorite. Users/AlexPomeranz

20051013 17:41:10 nbsp Something about the name makes me think of an autopsy.  I hope they move the body aside before making the ice cream.  This is pretty much heart attack in a cone: Crisco with flavoring.  But one must be self destructive now and again, right? Users/MisterProfessor

20051015 20:55:43 nbsp To be honest, I wasnt very impressed by Marble Slab. They have lots of toppings, but very few flavors.  Users/MaggieBlank

20060707 10:48:36 nbsp not the greatest ice cream shop to go to.  X only accept cash. X  servers can be rude.  portions are not as great as places such as coldstones.  way too expensive.  graham cracker mixin tastes stale.  not a fan, at all. Users/OnnieLin

20061110 21:39:27 nbsp Sweet cream with chocolate chip mixins...Delicious. The pumpkin flavor is pretty good too. Users/ErwinSena

20070221 19:11:28 nbsp yea they take cards, and yea they also have wild wednedays Users/AndreaPasiliao
