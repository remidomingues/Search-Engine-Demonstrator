Marc Hicks is a Davisite.  He still has several long standing records in the gym at Davis Senior High School DHS for track events. He is the Davis Joint Unified School District DJUSD school safety liason. He bridges the gap from the yard narks to the real cops.  Hicks was chosen to the Davis Senior High School Hall of Fame DHS Hall of Fame in 2012.

 When I was at DHS, I was told that if you cut class and tried to run from him, he would certainly catch you.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
