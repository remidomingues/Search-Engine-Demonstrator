Really amazingly beautiful photos of West Pond, Marcia!  I was going to make them thumbnails so that people can click on them and view them full sized, but ran into some problems.  I asked some other editors for help in doing so; those are such pretty photos, people should be able to view the full sized versions!  You have a wonderful eye for water and light, and I  thank you for sharing your wonderful work  I really enjoyed the photos. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
