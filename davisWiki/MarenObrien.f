Hi, Im Maren.  There are many ways to describe me.  Im fun, outgoing, sarcastic, basically a whole lotta fun!  I really enjoy music, movies, hanging out with friends, meeting new people, and going out.  I graduate this December!!  Woohoo let the countdown begin!  Im majoring in English and minoring in History.  I know what youre thinking....obviously she wants to be a teacher, right?  Well, I dunno.  Im still exploring all my possibilities.  The thought of making a final decision terrifies me.  

Im currently working and going to school.  I work as a Student Assistant for the State in the Department of Conservation, California Geological Survey Library.  Im taking English 106, Grammar, and English 180, Childrens Lit.  I cant wait for the education of Maren OBrien to be over!  Maybe some day Ill suck it up and go to Grad School, but Im on burn out at the moment.

Well, thats all for now!
