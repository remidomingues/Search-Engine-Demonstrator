In 2009, she was one of 100 people nominated for the potential position of http://whitehousefarmer.com/ White House Farmer and won third place! The website was started by an Illinois farming family, and they began the search for the position of White House Farmer as a follow up on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan Michael Pollan’s call for a White House Farmer. Pollan suggested the farmer be charged with transforming “five prime southfacing acres of the White House lawn and planting in their place an organic fruit and vegetable garden” whose produce will be used by the White House Chef, and given to area food banks.

Her placement will allow her to travel to Washington DC, and if the formation of the positions are accepted by the White House, to work with President Obama and the White House Chef team.  UC Davis is among the finest agricultural institutions in the States and it is only proper that a student of ours gets to farm the White House lawn.
