Image(marge1.jpg, thumbnail, left, The reign of Marge.) Image(marge2.jpg, thumbnail, right, Marge and her boy toys.) Marge is a freerange orbweaver Spiders spider belonging to both the permanent and transient residents of 831 Anderson Road Anderson. Marge has two boy toys (names currently unknown) and prides herself on her northfacing web situated near an orange tree and a fence of purple trumpet flowers. Marges hobbies include reinforcing the statutes of matriarchy, catching assorted insects, weaving, and drinking the occasional lager while listening to metal (preferably Luca Turilli).

Dont be caught in her web.

It should be noted that Marge recently gave birth and has lost some pregnancy weight as a result.
