Margie is a graduate of UC Davis since 2007, with her bachelors in music theory/composition, and a complete and total music dork.  Theory, University Chorus chorus, University Chamber Singers chamber singers, California Aggie Marching BandUh Banduh, she does it all.  She also has a cat named Katie.  She likes singing, playing instruments (especially piano, guitar, and flute), writing fiction or fanfiction, and hanging out with friends.  Her favorite TV show is Firefly, and her favorite movies are Star Wars (any of them but mostly A New Hope) and Serenity.  She also enjoys reading the BabySitters Club series, and shes been a fan since 1992.

Her favorite food is her moms cooking, but you could find her dining at Hunan, Fuji chef Fuji, Crepeville, Taqueria Guadalajara Guad, Plutos, and IHOP when she still lived in Davis.  She practically lived at the Music Building Music building before she moved to Ireland (and then graduated), and you could frequently find her in the choir room or possibly napping on one of the benches downstairs.  Nowadays, she is usually only in Davis for events like Picnic Day or participating in the Alumni Chorus.







Margie recently graduated with her BA in music theory/composition from UC Davis in summer 2007.  Currently, she is living at home with her family in Sunnyvale, and working fulltime as a nanny in Woodside.  She also does a lot of babysitting on the side.  Future plans include a graduate degree in music theory, but shes not sure where yet.
