Marguerite Montgomery School is one of the elementary schools in Davis. Their website is worth a visit to read about http://www.djusd.k12.ca.us/Montgomery/montgomery2.htm how the school was named.

Montgomery Elementary is one of two elementary schools in the district that has a Spanish DJUSD Spanish Immersion Program Immersion program, and it currently serves grades K5. The SI program expanded in the 201213 school year to include a combination 4th/5th grade class and added a 1st grade class geared toward students who attended traditional kindergarten the year before and were on the SI waiting list. A 6th grade SI class is planned for 201314. In the past, to continue with the program in grades 46, students needed to transfer to Cesar Chavez Elementary School.

Montgomery hosts a branch of the Yolo County Library known as the http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page1974 South Davis Montgomery Satellite Branch. It is open on Tuesdays from 5:00  9:00 PM and Saturdays from 10:00 AM  2:00 PM in the school library.

On April 30, 2011, the school played host to a swarm of volunteers from Mormon Helping Hands who did extensive landscaping and cleanup.
