A beautiful restaurant serving delicious fresh Mexican food with a bar.  The bar has a large TV,  now showing the 2014 World Cup.  It is quiet in the restaurant area.  There also is a shaded patio.
Last week on Taco Tuesday they offered a Woodland taco for $2 and a chefs taco for $3.  A dinner for 2, including drinks and a flan to share, cost about $50.

Remember to add this restaurant to the Restaurants page.
