Mariah Montanez had her last name changed on January 13th 2006 when she married her souls counterpart, Andres Villela.

She currently resides in Davis, CA but is scheduled to move to San Diego upon the arrival of her spouse from his second tour in Iraq.
Shes kind and flakey and will simply talk to anyone she deems worthy which is most everyone.

Her strict vegan diet is the product of her compassionate beliefs in animal rights.
She spends most of her time working at the L Street Furniture store (where she finds comfort in the clutter), chefing the shit out of vegan food on campus, and taking orders over the phone for Pizza Guys simply because shes super woman.

peace.
