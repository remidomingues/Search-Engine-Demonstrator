 Candidate Statement 
What’s up Aggies!

My name is Mariah Kala Watson and I want to be your next ASUCD Senator because I want your voice to be heard! I am a second year International Relations Major and Middle Eastern South Asian Studies Minor from the beautiful city of Los Angeles. I am a Peer Educator for the Cross Cultural Center, a commissioner on the Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission, and the Publicity and Outreach Chair for the Black Student Union. I have served as the Chief of Staff for Senator Alyson Sagala and sat on the Cuarto Leadership Council.

I’m running with the SMART slate: Student Matter: Activism, Retention, Teamwork because I truly believe in the power of all students on this campus. In my first year, I helped plan multiple conferences, put on a concert on the quad (Votechella), and wrote legislation that not only helped many people on this campus feel safer, but got multiple communities to get up and get active. I’ve worked closely with multiple ASUCD Units. These positions afforded me insight into the operations of our student government, as well as the expectations and duties of an ASUCD Senator. Using my skills, experience, and time, I will be YOUR advocate and push passionately and effectively to improve your college experience TODAY.

MID QUARTER EVALUATIONS

Turning in evaluations at the end of the quarter doesnt benefit YOUR education within that class. EARLIER evaluations help improve your educational experience. With an anonymous option, students can give honest and confidential feedback. My process is simple. Smartsite already has a “mail tool” choice, allowing students to directly contact their professors and TA’s. I plan to include a option to hide your email to allow anonymous submissions. Let’s work SMARTER, not harder, to improve life within the classroom.

HELP REDUCE CAMPUS WIDE HUNGER

Reinvest in The Pantry. One of our greatest and most under utilized units on campus is The Pantry. The mission of this unit is to “aid UC Davis students in their pursuit of a higher education by ensuring that no student ever has to miss a meal or go without basic necessities due to financial reasons”. Times are hard for all students on campus. By reinvesting in the Pantry, we are investing in the physical and overall health of every student. No student should have to choose between rent and food. By advocating for increased funding, better resources, and alumni networking for the Pantry, we can ensure that we will have enough food for ALL students.
