Marianne Waage (http://yamara.plush.org) came to Davis in 1996 to attend UC Davis. She graduated in 2001 with a B.S. (yes, science, not art) in design Graphic Design and a minor in Computer Science. She got a job at the Mathematics Department of Mathematics on campus, where she continues to work today. She handles their graphic design needs, as well as database work and some system administration.

She helped cofound the LUGOD Linux Users Group of Davis, and has been responsible for designing their site, including its present incarnation. Shes designed sites for a bunch of random places, almost as if she (sometimes) gets paid for doing it.

When not at work, she spends her time researching her family history, playing Dungeons and Dragons, dancing, making chainmail jewelry, drawing in ink, http://www.cafepress.com/geekstar/ designing tshirts, and learning to play the guitar and ukulele. She tries to cram all this in between her Experimental College Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido classes.
