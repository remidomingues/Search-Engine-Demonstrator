You say you are from San Jose, but where are you now, your recent edits seem to originate from Broomfield Colorado, can you explain this conflict? ~Users/DavePoole

20070226 15:39:55 nbsp Look at the history. Marie Gruca was created by Steve Ostrowski. Users/GeoffJohnson

20070226 15:46:32 nbsp Marie is a wacko, to be sure, and Steve O. has been known to use sockpuppet accounts to hide his identity.  However, the IP addresses that Marie has posted from are indeed registered in San Jose, and Steve O. created her userpage, not her account.  Creating a userpage for a new user is a very common thing on Davis Wiki  its generally considered to be a courteous action.  Dave, what makes you think Maries IP addresses are in Colorado?  You arent using one of those reliably inaccurate IP geolocation services, are you?  And Geoff, youre misunderstanding how page creation and account creation interact. Users/GrahamFreeman
  Sadly, yes I am... ARIN WHOIS seems indeed.. unreliable, any suggestions as to a better site, in any case, it seems relatively the case that this individual is not a Sock puppet of Steves.  Users/DavidPoole
  I assure you if this account was under my control the comments and edits would have been more subtle. That said I do have the unique ability of being in two places at once.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20070228 22:03:51 nbsp Im definitely not from San Jose, nor from Colorado, nor a construct of some dude in cyberspace. And I take being called a wacko by your ilk as a compliment. Users/MarieGruca
  You are making your edits from San Jose, that is all we need to know.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070301 12:21:38 nbsp No Im NOT....isnt this irritating? Users/MarieGruca

20070301 17:57:40 nbsp You might not be in San Jo, but your ISP might be. Are you located relatively close to San Jose? Is the number your modem dials a SJ area code?  Not to mention IP > Geolocation is relatively sketchy. I get Dial1.SanJose1.Level3.net. I noticed alot of your comments are loaded so to speak. If you ever have any questions about the wiki at all, I suggest you talk with Users/jabberwokky jw... Oh, Steve isnt some dude in cyberspace, hes a UCD student with a major in ASUCD Users/StevenDaubert
  I will be the first to teach a class at the experimental college on ASUCD, it will be the best ever!  Users/SteveOstrowski
  20070303 10:18:35 nbsp So, what do you call loaded, Steven? Elaborate. Users/MarieGruca

20070303 11:11:47 nbsp Steven, you really dont get how IP Addresses work and are used in real life.  Marie might be anywhere in the state  the fact that her dialup service uses IP addresses whose administrative contact is in San Jose has very little bearing on her physical location.
