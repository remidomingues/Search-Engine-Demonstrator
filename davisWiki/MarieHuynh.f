20080917 01:20:57 nbsp How were you able to take
classes at UC Berkeley while in high school,
upper division as a freshman at UC Davis, and
graduate classes as an undergrad? Users/ThanhVu

  I wanted to take an interesting sounding graduate class as a freshman but figured Id probably fail it.  It takes lots of prep, dedication, multitasking, and sleepless nights.  You have to be willing to read EVERYTHING that is assigned ahead of time (and then some) because youre being graded alongside people with up to 4 years of coursework ahead of you.  Theyve seen it all before; you havent so you need time to let it all soak in.  The goal is to be so far ahead that lecture is like review.  Thats not always feasible, but having insane goals means you get the most out of your time in college.  You learn to do things like eat with one hand while writing code with the other.  You schedule everything and are never without something to do or read.  There is no end to your todo list.  You schedule your social life and treasure the times you unexpectedly bump into friends.  If you want to be this crazy, just talk to your profs.  Oh, and pick up a small planner.  Youll need it.

20091028 04:27:57 nbsp Whatever happened to Bink and Pralos eggs? Users/JabberWokky

20100829 17:35:06 nbsp Hah, perhaps I should have been more clear. I meant to ask something more on the lines of how were you able to take those classes, i.e. how did the bureaucracy allow you to skip ahead like that. Users/ThanhVu
