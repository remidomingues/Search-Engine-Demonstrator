wiki:wikipedia:Marijuana, a.k.a., Cannabis, is often referred to as weed, pot or ganja among other things. There are both state and federal laws against the possession and sale of marijuana.  However, California law permits medical use of marijuana by people who have medical doctors recommendation.

It is a Drugs drug that is pretty easy to get in Davis, thanks to a solid base of college students. There are two Head Shops head shops in Davis these days with a fairly decent selection. Newsbeat sells corn cob and mini wooden pipes without the holes in the sides (carbs); these are intended for tobacco only, but they are very cheap ($3.25) and will do in a bind. You can buy hemp products all over town and obviously the Whole Earth Festival causes a cloud to descend on the city.   Folks that smoke a ton of weed are commonly referred to as http://www.youtube.com/watch?vvT12MTZmJT0 stoners or potheads.

Some think that this substance is one of the cornerstones of Davis life and culture and that if Davis wasnt so full of good grass then it would be full of a lot of bored and angry college kids. Others disagree and think it is the shadiness factor scourge of the earth.

Some Davisites also believe that cannabis is a gateway drug ...  to awesomeness.  Of course, its nickname demon weed also points to others blaming it for quite a bit of sadness and pain.

 The Law 

After Prop 36 was passed in 2000, the penalties for possession of marijuana were made much lighter. Possession of an ounce (28.5 grams) or less is not an arrestable offense. It became a misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine, but no jail time. If you are under the age of 21, the court can also take away your driver license for up to a year. Possession of paraphernalia is punishable by a civil fine of $200300 for the first offense, more for subsequent offenses. Penalties for the sale and cultivation of marijuana are much greater. More information on the law regarding marijuana can be found http://norml.org/index.cfm?wtm_view&Group_ID4525 here.

In 2010, possession of an ounce or less was downgraded from a misdemeanor to an infraction. In effect, this means that the consequences of getting caught with a moderate amount of pot are no greater than if you were to receive a mild traffic citation. All that lingers is the $100 fine, although the matter is public record and could show up in a background check.

Medical Marijuana laws are also in effect and can be found http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID4525&wtm_viewmedical here.  Even though there are medical marijuana laws in California, the U.S. still classifies marijuana as a schedule 1 drug and sometimes enforces over California laws, including for medical marijuana.  420 Relief, now  Departed Businesses out of business, was a place in Davis where marijuana cards could be obtained by qualifying patients in order to have Legal Services legal Medical Services medical access.

 Culture 


Hunter S. Thompson jokingly offers this advice:

 You will not be able to see his eyes because of TeaShades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension, and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he cant find a rape victim.  He will stagger and babble when questioned.  He will not respect your authority.  The Dope Fiend fears nothing.  He will attack for no reason, with every weapon at his command  including yours.  Beware.  Any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.  One stitch in time  on him  will usually save nine  on you.)

 Marijuana Addiction Recovery  

Marijuana Anonymous
For those who think pot may be a problem Marijuana Anonymous (MA) is available. MA is a 12 Step program guided by the 12 Traditions. A belief in a higher power is suggested but not mandated: only a desire to stop using marijuana is needed.

Other Recovery Options
Other recovery options include medical treatment (talk to your physician!),  http://www.unhooked.com/faq/index.htm LifeRing, http://smartrecovery.org/ SMART Recovery and other 12 step programs with a general consumer scope, such as http://www.na.org/ Narcotics Anonymous or http://www.ca.org/ Cocaine Anonymous which welcome potheads. All have online information, chat, and meetings and other help for those who have lost control over their use. Many churches have 12 Step programs that dont follow the 12 Traditions.


 Balanced views 

   http://www.nap.edu/html/marimed/ National Academy of Sciences Report  Points out several health problems associated with smoking marijuana, and presents a case for medical use (and prompts for research on how to get the medical effects without the side effect of getting high).

 Legal Issues 

If you get caught smoking weed the consequences can vary widely.  I would suggest getting caught by the Police police rather than your mother.  They really are much easier on you.  If you get caught by the police with a small amount of weed, they will probably confiscate it and your pipe/bong/joint/wooden leg/smoking device, take down your name, and tell you to be on your way. Legally speaking, possession of one ounce (28.5 gms) or less is punishable by a maximum $100 fine. If you have >1 ounce youll probably get arrested and maybe charged.  Possession with intent to sell any amount of marijuana is a felony. If you are driving, and the cops find weed in your car, you  will probably get a DWI if you are acting stoned.  However, there is no test for being under the influence of marijuana and therefore if you act normal its very hard to prove.  Beware that cops are more likely to hassle you about drugs in a vehicle than when you are walking around with them.

Warning: If you are planning on getting caught with Drugs illegal drugs, I suggest you do not rely on me or Daviswiki, neither of which takes any responsibility for you.  If you are charged with a Crime crime, find yourself a Law Firms lawyer.

You just gotta know Where to go if youre stoned where, and who.

For medical marijuana users there are several dispensaries in the Sacramento and Bay areas. There are no dispensaries physically located in Yolo County. However, a few local patient to patient collectives serve the Davis area with delivery of medicinal products. You can find a list of delivery services in Davis at http://www.weedmaps.com.

Davis City Code Davis Municipal Code/40.26.275 40.26.275: Prohibition of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries. Medical marijuana dispensaries are prohibited in all zoning districts, including without limitation to all planned development districts. The city adopted this ordinance because of the conflict between federal and state law on medical marijuana.

 Discussion 
 A view on the topic of Marijuana 
  Im new to wiki, and this is quite confusing.  I just want to add to the discussion, not edit the entry.  But I certainly have strong views about how the entry is slanted, and would love to change it, but I know from trying to correct wikipedia that the regulars are intensely defensive and will quickly censor things to fit their views.  Be that as it may, hear me out as to this topic:  for starters, the term marijuana is a racist term, designed to associate ganja with the scariness assigned Mexicans back in the reefer madness days (view that one on YouTube, kids, alongside U.S. Military propaganda piece Hemp for Victory!) when the persuasion machine of the hugelypowerful paper industry was making sure to nip in the bud any attempts to switch over to the more efficient hemp plant.  So this page and anyone in the medical, safeaccess movement should be calling it cannabis, its actual name, with MJ getting relegated to an embarassing footnote of history. (My initial search was for medical cannabis of course, which turned up no hit.)   But that cultural smear mentality certainly pervades the discussion here, and as well in the article itself.  Speaking of dictionaries, who says its a drug?  Its an herb.  br  The propaganda machine of the government (i.e. Clintons Gen. McCaffrey paying for propaganda elements to be placed in the plots of television SitComs..  salon exposed that so someone might dig up the link) declares it to be, because they are lobbied heavily by the likes of AnheuserBusch (repeated contributor to the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting which terrorizes rural citizenry by helicopter)..  the typical megaconglomerate having its way thoroughly with Governmental power, to the detriment of the typical working stiff.  I think the conformists would say drug has to do with effects..  well guess what, the one legal DRUG, as I see it, which is recreational and has virtually no medical applications, but which is excruciatingly physically addictive (while ganj is not in the least) is of course alcohol, the scourge of any and all college towns.  Pushed at every corner store in addictivelysized and priced packaging, and the brews conform to zero requirements as to listing their ingredients.  I can pull up a few quotes from the Founding Fathers of this land..  aggies in the true sense as they cherished the settlers connection to the land and its fruits  praising cannabis and promoting its cultivation..  I suspect searching through such volumes for references to booze would produce comments more along the lines of warning against degeneracy.   I can go on and on, but how about a bunch of links that do a better job than I can at making the case:
     A show that airs on Davis own KDRT is  http://CulturalBaggage.org  which is hosted by an excop who often interviews Law Enforcement Against Prohibition..  (current officers, many).
     Another show not to miss is webonly (or iPhone App?) as for Davisites:  http://expertwitnessradio.org   which airs over WBAI.org and is hosted by DEAturnedwhistleblower Mike Levine.
     Not sure if its in print anymore, but someone can look up and please link up the book stuffed with facts called The Emperor Wears No Clothes  on cannabis issues specifically.
      I actually did hear a science report on a shortwave (wrn.org)  broadcast (radionetherlands perhaps?)  correlating daily pot smoking with dimentia as subjects got into middle age.
     But I wonder whether one can adequately correct for tainted supply.. an insidious ramification of the arbitrary prohibition/demonization under which we suffer.  (Hence the website, http://safeaccess.org  BTW.)
     Im sure someone good at editing and in the editorial incrowd can reformulate my rantings here into some cogent editing of this article, but if you take nothing else away from reading my rant (excuse me for typing 80wpm)

  Im told smoking the seeds causes impotence (the chemical that causes this is concentrated there).
     That study is fairly flawed when applied to most weekend or casual users.  The problem with that is that they way they defined marijuana users was people who smoked roughly twice a day on a continual basis.  Anyone doing that much of anything will be come impotent.
     NOTE: Who the hell smokes pot seeds???  Ive heard of grinding them into flour, but I dont think Ive ever known anyone to smoke em!  Users/SummerSong
  Also, potsmoking has been proved to increase susceptibility to schizophrenia and depression. These results are not attributable to more mentally ill using marijuana, there is a definite causeand effect between pot smoking and higher incidence rates of mental illness. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4305783.stm Drug doubles mental health risk March 1st, 2005 BBC News world edition
   Despite what this particular study claims, studies are rarely able to PROVE a definite causeand effect relationship between ANYTHING and most authorities agree that most drug studies tend to be flawed and/or biased to begin with (for both the pro and con side).  Just take a look at researchers track record through the years and youll see this.   
   For extra reading on drug culture and how it relates to health in general, I really recommend the book The Natural Mind: A Revolutionary Approach to the Drug Problem by Andrew Weil, M.D.  Users/BobbyGray
    http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html Andrew Weil is a quack.  Users/WilliamLewis
        According to that author.  I would still recommend the book, and would NOT endorse that article nor its author (anyone who has read much of Weils work will note that the article is taking several words out of context, and completely skews Weils philosophy).   Users/BobbyGray

  Most medical experts agree that smoking cannabis in itself does not cause mental illness, but that people who are predisposed to psychosis are much more likely to develop symptoms if they use the drug regularly.

  Its important to note that marijuana has never been found to increase any risk of anything other than lung diseases/cancer when smoked.  Instead, there are correlations, but no positive or negative cause and effects.  Any side effects pot smoking has is countered by its other effects, as my Biology of Cell Death instructor admitted.  In fact, marijuana is less harmful than alcohol because of this.  If weed is ingested, not smoked, there is really no bodily harm (however, it is not doubtful that harm can come from not studying or working enough due to the calmness and sometimes lack of energy/laziness that weed attributes to).

   if you google: 2006 lung cancer marijuana, youll find that there was a study done at UCLA showing NO LINK between lung cancer and smoking marijuana. they actually think the THC may fight against lung cancer!! (one of many articles: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729_pf.html Washington Post)

  If anyone is curious about side effects, I suggest you read this http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_225.html article from The Straight Dope, a source I find very reliable.  It addresses all the issues mentioned above.  Users/MiriamKaufman

  Thanks for the article, Miriam.  I just didnt have the hard evidence to back up my info and the article covers the points I made perfectly! I especially like, on the whole it causes fewer problems than its two main competitors on the recreational drug scene, alcohol and tobacco...you do have to ask why marijuana is illegal and alcohol and tobacco arent.

        Ah, but meanings have never been under the exclusive interpretation of dictionaries. Users/JosephBleckman
         So therefore making it legal would cause a sharp drop in the number of degenerate people in this country!! Degeneracy has to do with morality  legality is a distinct concept. Users/KarlMogel KJM

    Actually, according to a World Health Organization study, smoking pot is SAFER than smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/58013.stm bbc article)
    my understanding is marijuana destroys the cilia in the throat / lungs, where as ciggarettes have some steroids or other things that cause the cilia to stay alive and mutate.  Users/StevenDaubert
     Steven, Im not familiar with the relation of cilia to the destruction of throat/lungs, but if you google: 2006 lung cancer marijuana, youll find that there was a study done at UCLA last year showing NO LINK between lung cancer and smoking marijuana. they actually think the THC fights against lung cancer!! smoking tobacco, however, did show there to be a  link to lung cancer.

Marijuana smoking also did not appear to increase the risk of head and neck cancers, such as cancer of the tongue, mouth, throat, or esophagus, the study found.
      Marijuana is a doubleplusdangerous drug.  Do not commit drugcrime.  The government wants to protect you from yourself, please let it!   Users/BrentLaabs
      Keeping the cilia alive would encourage them to mutate iirc, as opposed to them just being killed off and being replaced  Users/StevenDaubert
I find it both amusing and somewhat hypocritical that Davis, the supposed paragon of liberal thought and deed, forbids medical marijuana dispensaries within its borders.
They cite the conflict between state and federal law Daubert
          That fact has always annoyed me.  Hunter S. Thompson once said something about how left and rightwing politics are actually illusory in their description They are better described as a circle rather than a straight line with true polar opposites.  Extreme liberalism actually has a lot in common with fascism because, in both systems, you have people who are sure their way of life is superior to the point of having no problem bossing you around. For example, Davis is the only place Ive lived where strangers have consistently come up to me on the street to tell me to put out my cigarette because its hurting their health.  Users/ScottMeehleib
