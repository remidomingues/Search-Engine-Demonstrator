Marijuana Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share our experience, strength, and hope with each other that we may solve our common problem and help others to recover from marijuana addiction.

For those who think Marijuana  pot may be a problem, Marijuana Anonymous, aka MA, is a wiki:wikipedia:Twelvestep program 12 Step addiction recovery support group with open and closed meetings. All MA meetings in Sacramento and Davis are open meetings where nonaddicts are welcome. The main MA site has http://www.marijuanaanonymous.org/onlinemeetings.shtml online meetings

Other recovery options include medical treatment (talk to medical professional),  http://www.unhooked.com/faq/index.htm LifeRing, http://smartrecovery.org/ SMART Recovery. Other more inclusive 12 step programs, such as http://www.na.org/ Narcotics Anonymous or http://www.ca.org/ Cocaine Anonymous welcome potheads. Also, many churches have 12 Step programs which forgo the 12 Traditions.

As of April 2014, Marijuana Anonymous meetings are now being held at 1111 H street on Sunday mornings at 10:30 AM.

 Youve never met people who smoke their entire paycheck and feel the need to be stoned 24/7? Sure, it isnt a chemical addiction, but it certainly can be problematic.  wl
