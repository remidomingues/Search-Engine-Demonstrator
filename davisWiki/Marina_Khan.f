Marina Khan is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2009 ASUCD Election running on the L.E.A.D. slate.

HELLO UC DAVIS!!!! My name is Marina Khan and I am a L.E.A.D candidate running for ASUCD Senate this fall. I am a third year International Relations major with a double minor in History and Communications. I want to be your ASUCD Senator because I absolutely LOVE this university and want to be a representative for all students and groups on campus. UC Davis is going through significant changes and I know I could be the voice of the students. I want to hear what you have to say, and I am open to any ideas/improvements you may have.

I have been involved on campus for the last 3 years in various groups and activities. Through my involvement I have seen how great UC Davis truly is, but like any other campus it can always be improved. With your support, I want to make UC Davis the best it can be and a place we can all be proud of!
