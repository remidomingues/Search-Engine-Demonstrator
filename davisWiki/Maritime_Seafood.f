Maritime Seafood is a restaurants restaurant in Woodland that serves seafood.  The owners are gracious , the staff are knowledgeable, the winelist is great and the food is well worth the price.  The owners started with the Old Post Office in Vacaville, opened this one, hopped up to Redding and opened one there, and now one is open in Carmichael.

Fish, meat dishes are seasonal and excellent.  Desserts are to dream about. . . the only negative is that the photos on the menu weblink dont do it justice.
