There are additional reviews about Marjan from when she worked at Ninas Studio, particularly in the Ninas Studio/Reviews from 2008 comment archives.

20100208 10:09:01 nbsp I met Marjan at a really low point in life, I walked into the salon and she sat me down and gave me a new look!!! I felt so good about myself after talking with her. She takes a real approach to people and enjoys what she does. I feel so relaxed when I am in her chair and cannot wait for my next appt. She does an awesome job!!!!  Users/lreynolds104

20100227 14:39:40 nbsp Ive been going to Marjan when she worked at the Style Lounge and when she moved to Avant Garde.  She is the only person I know of that does threading in Davis.  She does a great job on my eyebrows and she gives me beautiful haircuts.  My hair is very thick and long, but Marjan takes her time and helps make my hair more manageable.  I always get compliments on my haircut!  Users/jas1

20100303 16:48:53 nbsp Marjan is wonderful.  Unlike many stylists, her european training allows her the skills to really do an exceptional job.  Europeans train fir many years and it is so obvious in Marjans skills as both a colorist and a stylist.  I am so happy that she is still in Davis.  Plus she threads!  There is nothing like threading to shape eyebrows.  Users/sschladow

20100305 21:54:58 nbsp Marjan did an awesome job on my hair! She understood my hair so well and made me feel comfortable and made sure I like my new style. I will definitely go to her again. Thanks Marjan! Users/cjchung

20100127 18:39:02 nbsp Marjan has been threading my eyebrows for me since I first moved to Davis 2 years ago.  I found her first at Ninas and was so impressed with her work, not to mention the fact that it is very difficult to find a person who even performs the service.  When I lived in NY and LA, I never had trouble finding a good threading specialist.  When I moved to Davis, I was at a loss because I couldnt find anyone who would even do threading let alone do it right.  I was so relieved to find Marjan, she is such an artist and my eyebrows always look perfect after I visit her.  I was excited to find out that she also cut and colored hair and was curious to see if her hairdressing skills measured up to her threading skills.  Well, she surpassed my expectations.  She gave me a beautiful trendy haircut that complimented the texture of my hair and the shape of my face.  I have also been dyeing my mostly grey hair myself for the past 10 years, ultimately ending up with a color that is too dark and mousy.  I consulted with Marjan about a color change and she knew exactly what to do.  I trusted her due to my previous experiences and just let her have her way with my hair.  She decided to add highlights to my hair to lighten it gradually.  She chose a beautiful color that actually made me look 10 years younger. She was fast and efficient and her conversation was so wonderful that time flew by.  I felt like I was hanging out with my best girlfriend and before I knew it my hair was done, and done beautifully.  If you are a eyebrow wax type of girl, I highly recommend you give Marjan a try.  Her threading techniques are fast and less painful than waxing.  I also never have to worry about chemical burns on my eyebrows, as every girl who waxed my eyebrows in Davis would burn me.  I am so glad that I found Marjan because she is good at all of these services and it is like one stop shopping for me.  The salon Avante Garde is beautiful and comfortable.  Marjan is the only girl who has impressed me enough to forget about my previous overpriced and overhyped stylists in NYC.  Users/Keira

20100201 16:18:31 nbsp I first had my eyebrows threaded by Marjan at another salon, and after I discovered the magic she works at haircutting, I havent had my hair cut by anyone else since. She does a beautiful job, caters to your needs, and is friendly and flexible. My eyebrows turn out great every time, too, and shes incredibly fast at threading them. She is clearly skilled at what she does and applies her talent to help make my hair stylish and more manageable.  Users/RoseRed

20100312 14:52:04 nbsp I just had my first haircut with Marjan and she is absolutely amazing!  She is very friendly and knows her stuff.  Marjan was very open with me about what she was going to do, especially if it didnt quite fit into what I had said I wanted (I brought in a picture, but my hair was too short to make the style work exactly the same.)  We compromised, and Marjan was very forthcoming with advice and answered any questions I had.  I will definitely be going back! Users/ReeseLayton

20100317 18:54:06 nbsp Marjan is amazing!!! She made my hair look totally awesome today! I have been going to Marjan for almost five years and my mom and sister have too! We love her soooo much. If you ever want a great hair cut go to Marjanshes soo nice and always styles your hair the way you want it done!! Users/Jgreen

20100325 23:49:29 nbsp I have never been MORE pleased with a haircut/color. Marjan knows her stuff!! I was speechless when she finished my hair because it was better than I could have asked for or imagined. She had great input and is honest with her advice. I live quite a ways away, but will be making the trek up here for Marjan!!! A great, trustworthy and EXCELLENT hairstylist who is passionate about what she does! :)
I also got my eyebrows threaded and it was so quick and easy and they are great!  Users/Amanda19519

20100409 18:43:08 nbsp Its taken me a long time to find a local hairstylist that I trust and I am really happy with Marjan. She is opinionated without being pushy and I ve never left disapointed with my hair. try her for eyebrow threading too :) Users/bmamini

20100423 12:56:28 nbsp I was in desperate need of a haircut and stumbled across Avant Garde online. I saw Marjan today, and I have to say that she did a fantastic job! I brought in a picture, and she was able to easily customize the look to fit my hair/needs. She even asked me about my weekend plans, and when she found out I was going out tonight, she offered to put some extra work into styling and curling it. I am so pleased with my hair, and will definitely be going back to her in the future!!  Users/MicheleE

20100524 10:51:39 nbsp Marjan is one of the most detailed hair stylists I know. Her cuts are absolutely even and perfect. I love her feel for what looks best on me in context with my personality. And...she is such a lovable fun person. Cant wait to go back. Users/drsnuggles

20101001 12:02:17 nbsp I just got my hair cut at Avant Garde Studio this morning. I recently moved to Davis and was in desperate need for a trim. I called two days ago to make an appointment and luckily, Marjan answered the phone! I had a scheduling issue, and needed to make an appointment for earlier or the next day, and she was so accommodating to my needs, and luckily there was an opening at a perfect time. When I got to the salon, I decided to cut it all off, and Ive never felt more comfortable doing it at Avant Garde with Marjan. My cut is amazing, and she really listened to what I wanted. Shes very talented and so incredibly friendly! Im so happy with my choice to come to this salon, and the pricing is very fair for a cut these days. I cant wait to go back! :) Users/rachelledunn

20101201 15:55:53 nbsp I had my eyebrows threaded by Marjan was displeased. She was pleasant but tried to sell me on a haircut and other products. It was the most uncomfortable and painful threading experienced which says a lot since Ive been getting them threaded for over a year now. Other than that my eyebrows just werent the quite right. They were too thin and didnt look as tidy as usual. Users/alanajean

20101206 11:14:46 nbsp I have long, thick, curly hair (ringlets the diameter of your finger) that no one seems to be able to cut. No one, that is, except Marjan. I have been to many stylists, but no one has understood how to cut my hair like she does. My only regret is that I didnt find her sooner. With one look at an old picture of mine she was able to figure out how I liked my hair, and talk me through how she was going to undo my ridiculously bad cut. At every stage she showed me exactly what she was doing and explained why that was right for my hair type. I can relax when I go to see her, knowing my hair is in good hands Users/HalleyFobes

20101223 12:48:13 nbsp I love my hair!  Ive never had short hair before and didnt know what I wanted.  there is so much to say about marjan to be thankful for.  I will try to write more later because right now Im just too excited about my new look to put it into words.  more later! Users/JenniferStanton

20110106 06:04:12 nbsp Thank you so much Marjan!  I love my color!  It looks fantastic once I put on my dark makeup and darken my eyebrows.  I love how dramatic and different it is.  A great way to start the new year.  I also still love having short hair.  Hope you have a happy 2011!  Ill call you soon.  xoxox  ~Jennifer Users/JenniferStanton

20110801 08:57:54 nbsp Marjan did a fantastic job on my cut and colorit was exactly what I wanted but didnt know how to describe!  As an aside, she is also one of the few stylists I have seen who has not tried to sell me products/convince me I needed to flatiron my hair every morning, etc.  I will definitely be going back to see her. Users/BlytheDurbinJohnson

20110910 18:37:08 nbsp Ive been going to Marjan for amazing haircuts for the past couple years and recently for amazing color and highlights.  I always feel prettier after shes worked on my hair.  Marjan makes helpful suggestions when discussing haircuts.  Shes honest about what will work instead of forcing my hair to do something it just cant do (I have fine hair).  Marjans great!    Users/Pheebs

20110926 21:34:14 nbsp Ive been reading the comments here and wish I had as great an experience as everyone else. Unfortunately I did not. Marjan was late to my appointment and another person had to call her to bring her back from her break. When she came in I did not get any sense that she was welcoming, nor did I get an apology about forgetting of our appointment. She smelled like she had just been smoking, and I was pregnant which made it very unpleasant being so close to her. She was also very rough with my eyebrows, pulling and tugging very uncomfortably while asking me if it was the first time I had a threading, as if to imply it was my fault that it was so painful. Although she did do a very good job, I would not go back to her again. Furthermore, $15 is just a ridiculous amount for a threading, anywhere. Users/lunelectronique

20120611 14:00:02 nbsp I have been meaning to add a comment for a long time, but finally created an account on Davis Wiki just for this purpose. I have been going to Marjan for cut/color/threading for some time now (5 yrs or so). I think she is very talented. I am always happy with the results and I enjoy visiting with Marjan while she cuts my hair. Maybe its because I am a long time customer, but she always remembers me in person and on the phone and treats me very well when I am there (offers water and even bought me coffee one time while I was waiting for the developer to finish on my hair!) She works REALLY hard  sometimes I think she does not know how to say no so she gets booked pretty tight. The downside  I have had to wait a little (maybe 10 minutes tops) before she could get to me. But it is no problem for me since I like going here so much. I just factor in a little extra time...and remember  I am the one that called her for a last minute appointment and she kindly skipped her break to fit me in! Users/AshleyLewis

20121115 17:43:45 nbsp I have been getting my hair cut and colored by Marjan for about 4 years now and she is fantastic. Over the years I have come to Marjan after having colored my hair myself and she has both made my hair color beautiful and kept it healthy. Marjan has given me many different amazing haircolors, from black to red to blond; I have never been to anyone else that has been able to change my hair color so often and still keep it healthy. I have also had many different hairstyles from pixie to aline and have never received as many compliments as I did when Marjan started cutting my hair. I usually come to Marjan with a small idea of what I want and I end up leaving with a look that I love. I love coming to Marjan so much that I turned my friends and family on to her and now they love her too. Users/AzadehPourheidari

20130206 14:27:19 nbsp I Love Marjan SOOOOO Much I have been coming to her for about 6years and she saved my hair!! I went to someone before for less and each time they ruined my hair Marjan saved me so much and makes my hair look so good every time I have gone to her I will never change! I travel from out of town for her and it is so worth it!!!  Users/VaniaAlvarez

20130324 19:23:40 nbsp I visited Avant Garde for the first time yesterday and made an appointment with Marjan. She is an absolute genius! She gave me a masterpiece haircut... by far the best hair cut I have ever had! Definitely will go back!  Users/StephanieShiers

20130507 12:13:27 nbsp I go to Marjan for hair cuts and Brazilian blow outs. She is so nice and down to earth, I love her! and she does such a great job. Before Brazilian blow outs I would spend so much time styling my hair, I had to blow dry it then straighten it with a flat iron so it wouldnt be frizzy. Now I can just blow dry it gently and its not frizzy no need for a flat iron. :) Users/AileenEspinoza
