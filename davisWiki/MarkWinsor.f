20110915 14:04:11 nbsp Is there any connection to Davis?  Also, as far as I can tell, it doesnt have a single review for any Davis apartment complex. Users/TomGarberson

20110915 16:14:59 nbsp Mark, thats a nice sentiment.  I hope you wont be offended if I say Im skeptical, though.

First, the Orange Tree listing on the website has no information.  None.  It has a total of 6 page views, and two of those are from me.  Ill bet most or all of the others are from other wiki users.  It doesnt even have a photo of the complex.

Second, you posted the http://dixon.wikispot.org/Apartments?actiondiff&version21&version10 exact same message on the Dixon wiki, substituting Dixon for Davis.

Third, youre currently posting from the http://inlandgroup.com/ Inland Group, a real estate company in Burbank.

Fourth, your post from the 8th of this month was made from somewhere in the general vicinity of South Elgin, IL, a suburb of Chicago.  Meanwhile, the About Us from one of the websites you posted reads in part, Our company was founded in 2010 by a small group of real estate professionals in Chicago that saw a need for a social networking rental review site covering all types of rental properties.  The other one, meanwhile, states that it is owned by MCRE VEntures LLC, a small group of real estate investors in Chicago that founded the rental property review/social networking site you had previously posted.  MCRE Ventures (you might want to fix that typo, by the way) is registered in Glenview, IL, a hop, skip and a jump away from South Elgin.

A surprising set of coincidences, wouldnt you say?   Users/TomGarberson

20110915 16:33:27 nbsp tl;dr: Youre an asshole. Users/hankim

20110916 14:59:51 nbsp If Im wrong in my assessment, youre welcome to explain.  The best available evidence suggests that the links you added were spam and nothing more.  As long as thats the case, I think notice belongs here. Users/TomGarberson
