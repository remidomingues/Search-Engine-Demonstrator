Mark Yudof, a former (and soon to be again) law professor, is the current president of the University of California.  The New York Times named him one of the 10 Best College Presidents in this http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1937938_1937933_1937940,00.html article, though Yudof has drawn a lot of heat for his alleged mishandling of the budget crisis and his greenlight for a 32% fee hike that has left the majority of students reeling.

Yudofs essay, http://www.utwatch.org/finances/change_yudof_harbinger.html Higher tuitions: Harbinger of a Hybrid University?, discusses his views on hybrid public/private universities.

Yudof was preceded by Robert Dynes.  Prior to serving as UC President, he headed the University of Texas system.

On January 18, 2013, Yudof http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28955 announced that he would be ending his tenure as President of the University of California, effective August 31, 2013. On July 12, 2013, the UC Regents announced that Janet Napolitano has been nominated to succeed Yudof. Her nomination is expected to be confirmed at the July 18, 2013 UC Regents meeting.

As for his reason for resigning, Yudof stated:

 ..it has become clear to me that the time has come for me to step away and return to the teaching of law on the Berkeley campus. The prior 18 months brought a spate of taxing health issues. Though these challenges have been largely overcome, I feel it is time to make a change in my professional lifestyle.
 Beyond personal considerations, this also appears to be an apt time for the University to bring in fresh leadership.

The Vanguard asserted that Yudofs http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id6021:ucpresidentmarkyudoftoendhistenureinaugust&Itemid118 tenure will be remembered largely for the doubling of student tuition.
