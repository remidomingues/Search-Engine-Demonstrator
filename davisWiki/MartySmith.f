MartySmith is currently studying Political Science.  He is in his 4th year here at UC Davis.  His interests include (but are not limited to) playing the guitar, mountain biking, camping, hiking,  swimming, water polo, computers, and photography.

In many cases of extreme boredom, Marty can be seen riding about campus on a ratty mountain bike with a CocaCola bottle rack.  In many cases, he generally explores to find new places around campus or blazes new trails on bicycle.

Among other things, MartySmith has worked as a city pool lifeguard in his hometown.  However, he is much happier currently working as a Student Resident Firefighters Student Resident Firefighter at the campus Fire Department.

Once a frequent traveler of Amtrak like many other Bay Area Freshmen, he now calls Davis home...unless its Thanksgiving, Christmas, (or Spring) break.
