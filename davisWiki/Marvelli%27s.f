Marvellis was a Davis location for a Sacramento based family owned old fashioned ice cream parlor. They painted a mural that covered the south wall of the business with an old fashioned Davis scene and made their ice cream on site. They offered a range of sandwiches and other things to go with their drinks and ice cream dessert.

Previous to Marvellis, the popular local chain wiki:sacramento:Leatherbys Creamery Leatherbys was located here.  Going back to the early 80s, another Sacramento ice cream mainstay was located in this spot: wiki:sacramento:Vics Ice Cream Vics

Kens Bike & Ski is now at this location, and the mural can be seen there.
