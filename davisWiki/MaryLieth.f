Born in Woodland, raised in Davis, graduate of DHS.  I used to work at the Davis Public Library, and volunteered at the Davis Food Coop, KDVS and the Craft Center.

I worked extensively on the http://scwiki.org Santa Cruz Wiki while living there for four years.

I used to work extensively on this wiki, but then I realized that I have better things to do than get agitated by obnoxious users.

20070924 19:12:26 nbsp Hi, Mary,

Thanks for paving the way on the Santa Cruz Wiki!  You mentioned somewhere that you have a lot of photos but havent had a chance to process them yet.  Let me know if you want help  Id be happy to give pointers on how to use the wiki:santacruz:Instructional Computing computer labs to process and upload your photos.

Also, do you have an opinion on the domain name issue that I brought up on the wiki:santacruz:Wiki Administrivia page?

thanks,
 Users/Graham.Freeman

20071031 14:22:06 nbsp Wow!  You sure documented the Santa Cruz Boardwalk!  When I was there 6773 it was mainly the Big Dipper!  Good job! Users/RichLindvall

20071101 12:33:08 nbsp Thanks for your response, Mary.  I went to Souel HS.  Was always intrigued by the cement ship at Seaclif beachalso the trivia that the Apple cofounder was injured by a plane crash at Skypark airport in Scotts Valley.  I even remember Santas Village amusement park that existed in Scotts Valley years ago.  It was in the north end of town on the east side of #17. Users/RichLindvall

20080622 15:43:32 nbsp Hey, congrats on the degree! Users/JabberWokky

20080624 19:06:50 nbsp Nice idea on the nearby wikis. Users/JasonAller

20080701 12:31:27 nbsp Hey Mary... is there a reason you linked some of the spiritual organizations to their Wikipedia entries rather than to their local entries?  Like Baháí or Scientology?  In general, its a good idea to link locally and leave opportunity to have people create locally relevant entries rather than link out.  You also might want to look into interwiki links and how they work rather than making web links... down the line those should be easier to work with (for technical reasons involving tracking and moving entries). Users/JabberWokky

20080701 14:08:38 nbsp Dont worry about it  action and learning the layout of the wiki is the only way to figure that stuff out.  Theres a staggering amount of stuff on the wiki at this point, so dont sweat missing anything.  I just knew some of those already existed (and others I missed might as well).  As for pregnancy, anything added thats a bit off topic can be replanted elsewhere.  Thats why some of the people who constantly edit the wiki see it more as a gardening metaphor than anything else.  Stuff grows. Users/JabberWokky

20080704 00:20:05 nbsp Thank you!  I added the University Farm entry.  I figured that it is one of a handful of things that wound up shaping Davis the most. Users/JabberWokky

20080704 00:25:18 nbsp Wasnt even aware there was a problem... no worries! Users/JeremyOgul

20080706 16:04:20 nbsp Not all orphaned redirects are bad redirects. Some of them are useful now when searching and others are logical enough to keep. Users/JasonAller

20080706 16:16:24 nbsp Dont worry, decluttering is a good instinct and deletes can always be reverted if needed. Users/JasonAller

20080724 17:29:57 nbsp Awesome work over at wiki:citywiki! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080724 21:37:28 nbsp Every city wiki needs more ambiguation! Users/WilliamLewis

20080724 21:48:32 nbsp Hey, since youre editing other wikis, you should keep an eye on their individual copyright policy.  For instance, you should technically credit Davis Wiki as the source for that content that you copied over to City Wiki (as per Copyrights).  In that particular case Im pretty durn sure that none of the original authors mind (although I cant really speak for anybody but myself  thats why I drop things like the wiki:gnome:Overwhelmed Overwhelmed include or the Seed images at wiki:gnome GnomeHQ when I create them: theres a specific CC exception there for reuse), but when youre working across various wikis within Wiki Spot, some have different takes on that kind of thing.  Each wiki community develops their own traditions and rules, each creating a different culture of editing.  Some also have different Copyright on their content.  Its just something to be aware of as you edit around, so dont feel bad if you get flamed on or outright banned from a wiki.  Some are pretty authoritarian for various reasons. It can also be incredibly rewarding, like helping a group of sixth graders figure out how to build their wiki for a class project.  Some neat communities are growing out there. Users/JabberWokky

20080731 20:27:50 nbsp If you force a reload (shift reload or something like that) it should show up. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080801 07:39:51 nbsp Also, if you resize the image by one pixel, it forces a reload.  I havent checked with Internet Explorer. Users/JabberWokky

20080820 10:25:25 nbsp There used to be a list of the heaviest yogurt cups eaten in the store were listed on a sort of Hall of Fame list behind the counter. Individuals who could beat the top person on the list (by eating, instore, a heavier amount than the current top individual) would win a gift card. The list has since disappeared.  For some reason I am envisioning your next edit to be to Tragic Events. Users/JabberWokky

20080906 14:24:02 nbsp IKEA (the entry) was the location of one of the nastiest edit wars in Wiki history.  Not that there have been many, but it was really hard to find anything everybody would agree to.  A quick and easy way to check an entrys history is to hit the Talk Page and then view the last version before it was deleted.  The left over comments were probably not cleaned up because there needed to be a cool down period lest removing them would cause emotions to flare up.  Feel free to remove any headless replies that dont relate to IKEA. Users/JabberWokky

20081020 20:00:49 nbsp Hey, Mary... that Job Applications entry is really impressive. Users/JabberWokky

20090120 11:23:31 nbsp Sodexo contract wasnt terminated... the employees are now employed by the university rather than Sodexo, but Sodexo still operates what theyve always operated. Users/OscarSabino

20090326 21:41:06 nbsp They used to be minutemen before the collaborators killed them in their sleep. Users/JasonAller

20090415 11:13:17 nbsp Just as a heads up, AricaChhay emailed me asking (paraphrased) why are you editing my entry?.  Theres a bit of confusion there regarding how a wiki works.  I sent a fairly long email reply trying to explain the whole community editing thing, but since you just edited another of their entries, you might want to know theres a bit of honest misunderstanding there.  Users/JabberWokky

20090416 21:53:10 nbsp Mary  those are internal guidelines for the use of the seals for a group internal to the university.  They cant override US law (in this case, it is the established logo and/or trademark for the subject, and is used to illustrate the subject being discussed, which means we can use it on the wiki).  Their internal rules dont affect groups outside the university. Users/JabberWokky

20090423 02:22:46 nbsp that is some solid gnoming on the alcove Users/StevenDaubert

20110415 20:37:19 nbsp Perhaps he was confused this morning when we spoke about the facilities. I was told the sauna was men only, but maybe he meant steam room.  Meant no offense. I have never used the facilities.. Will starting on Monday although probably not the steam room or sauna. ;) Users/WesP
