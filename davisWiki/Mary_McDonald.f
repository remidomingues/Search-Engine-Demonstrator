Mary McDonald was an early Townies Davisite who owned a decent chunk of land in the southwestern corner of the fledgling town. She lived in a Victorian cottage, built in 1894; now listed as a historic places City Merit Resource, its located at 337 B Street. Along with her daughter, Alice Haines, Mary owned all the property ranging from what is now A street to B Street between 3rd Street and 4th street.  Apparently they operated a small farm and also rented out a few buildings to tenants. Their land was subdivided into various parcels in the late 1920s or early 30s, and Rice Lane was built at one of the boundaries.

Marys father was the local pioneer, John Caulfield, proprietor of the Ranchers Saloon.
