Mason is a gaming enthusiast who enjoys http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft World of Warcraft, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellgate_london Hellgate, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcraft The Best Game Ever. He sadly no longer frequents DRAGON because of scheduling conflicts.  He used to run a game there on alternating weeks.

He would like to share http://www.youtube.com/watch?vu6XAPnuFjJc&featureplayer_embedded&related this video because it explains why people created the wiki.

He works at La Quinta and xenjoys his work immenselyx it pays the bills...

He thinks that Wiki Community/outreach The Wiki Outreach Program is a wonderful program and wonders how it ever fell by the wayside.

He lives in a house managed by Zabace, Inc..

He is currently attending Sacramento City College and studying Civil Engineering to become an architect.

He is probably on hiatus from SCC, however, because he got in trouble with the law for http://daviswiki.org/Users/HWestbrook?actiondiff&version218&version117 stealing his girlfriends shoes.  It is unknown who looked better in them.

He can no longer frequent DRAGON due to scheduling conflicts with work, and is no longer running a game there. Feel free to contact him regarding this via email: MailTo(babys DOT in DOT a DOT blender AT gmail DOT com).

He would like to welcome Ronin, the newest member to his household.  A beautiful specimine of C. lupus familiaris.


Hey Mason, welcome to the wiki. Do remember please that the wiki is a familyoriented site, and edit your page accordingly. Users/JohnDudek

20080708 18:50:48 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. For instance dropping a link to a business you are affiliated with on a page about a competitor isnt really classy. Users/JasonAller

20081125 21:46:00 nbsp Hey, thanks for responding to my question!  I actually showed up at DRAGON sometime in October and Ive been playing there since, so Ive got myself all situated and in some games.  Thanks! Users/AndrewHarrison

20081202 20:43:21 nbsp It is called Droms Comics... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090327 19:42:06 nbsp You are so right about people having bad experiences with good businesses, thanks for saying that! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090423 02:25:16 nbsp hmmm

It does work... I have no idea how to accurately price it. Users/StevenDaubert

20090428 10:06:38 nbsp You are an equal member of the wiki community and have an equal right to a say in anything going on.  The term gnome just means a type of editing (cross linking, correcting spelling, etc) as opposed to adding a few topics and working with them.  As a side effect, gnomes tend to work all over the wiki.  That doesnt make them better, although it possibly makes for more experience with a variety of situations.  Still, you have a voice and a right to have a say in anything.

In that particular issue, I think things have settled down somewhat and most people are just leaving it alone to cool off.  Or at least I am. Users/JabberWokky

20090505 12:04:29 nbsp Ive been wondering about BlueDot myself, but I havent a clue.  Sorry. Users/CovertProfessor

20090507 11:29:30 nbsp KFCs fried chicken isnt my favorite (then again, Im originally from a region full of a bunch of really good fried chicken places, both single restaurants and small local chains... and they dont deep fry it, but rather pan fry it), but try it cold... just chuck it in the fridge and eat it the next day.  Preferably in a grassy field, surrounded by either trees and sky and nobody visible for miles, or a bunch of kids playing on a jungle gym and the softly muted sound of people around you.  Hard to beat. Users/JabberWokky

20090507 14:40:01 nbsp But Jim was incorrect in saying you have to stop deleting or Ill request you be banned.  While the fool addition was silly, I dont think the what the heck response was completely unwarranted, especially after all the people trying to explain the differences between user type pages. I think everyone needs to just chill out a bit and leave it alone. A few days to clear the air always helps.  Users/EdWins

20090508 12:00:05 nbsp Im not sure yet about next week. Ill keep you updated, though. Users/JohnDudek


20090511 12:07:22 nbsp I am fond of deleted comments/ pages and files. those were funny. Users/PxlAted

20090512 19:28:00 nbsp I dont know if I believe that you have nothing against me but all my classes are online and even if they wernt, I know nothing about woodland. Why dont you just go there, its not far.  Users/RealComputers

20090512 19:30:45 nbsp {{{wiki:woodland:page name display name}}} is the best way to do an interwiki link: wiki:woodland:Front Page like this.  Users/JasonAller

20090514 09:23:11 nbsp It was originally was named weed.  The problem is that weeds (as in gardening, which quite a few people in Davis do on a regular basis as well) dont have another common name, whereas weed (the kind you recreate with) does have another common name. Users/JabberWokky

20090514 09:46:43 nbsp Meh.  I personally tend to go by what the majority of people call it.  The majority of people in Davis across the entire town almost certainly use the term marijuana more often than cannabis.  Id say weed and pot are probably up there in general usage too.  I only pointed out the weed thing so you knew the history. Users/JabberWokky

20090514 10:56:32 nbsp I think you can redirect... Ive seen somebody do that somewhere.  In reality, the ideal is to copy it over, as they will grow in parallel.  I do understand the whole but theres not much of a Woodland Wiki community yet argument.  I do know that you cant include (which I would REALLY like to do in some cases). Users/JabberWokky

20090514 11:38:01 nbsp Its up to you and the other editors of Woodland Wiki.  There are pros and cons to both, and different solutions are probably better in different cases.   Users/JabberWokky

20090514 12:45:17 nbsp I will unfortunately be in Rohnert Park all of Monday, but I should be free Wednesday of next week. Busy, busy times! Users/JohnDudek

20090518 18:38:18 nbsp Your face. I was going to say your mom, but been there, done that. Users/KBathory

20090520 02:27:40 nbsp Oh, what did it say? Users/KBathory

20090521 16:42:43 nbsp Its a good question with no simple answer, so this reply is going to be vaguely philosophical.  Each edit like that is a tough call, and whatever is done will displease somebody.  Try to use common sense, and listen to their objections for their actual issue they have.  The easiest way to is to find a good break point (usually a calendar year or a managerial changeover) and archive them from that point back with a link from the main entry.  Another way is to read through them and be both aggressive and very careful on a case by case basis.  Theres no rule against removing and reworking comments, but theres a healthy community tendency to view it with suspicion.  (Note that Im talking about comments: reviews are yet another case).  Keep in mind that if youre not compromising here and there, youre probably not giving other people the room for their strong convictions regarding how the wiki should be edited.  If youre clearly fair and have sound reasons (and communicate them when asked), you can pretty much do anything that improves the wiki.  After all, thats kind of the point of editing it. Users/JabberWokky

20090521 19:30:42 nbsp why prune when you can just archive and start anew? Users/StevenDaubert

20090530 09:02:24 nbsp Holy crap dude, that WAS creepy, and definitely not me. I suppose I should change all my messaging passwords, but Id be able to tell if someone tried to log on somewhere else. And hey, it doesnt really matter anyway. If something like that happens again, let me know. Eeew. Users/KBathory

20090530 23:40:02 nbsp Hello Mason,

20090716 16:04:05 nbsp Hey man. Remember that mod I made or crysis a while ago? I have vastly improved it since. Check it out. Nuke cannon and giant aliens. http://www.moddb.com/mods/loser Users/RealComputers

20090722 23:49:07 nbsp I do throw work ur way sometimes; if theres a problem I cant fix. The way my mod is now, its actually more difficult than the normal game because I didnt just change the settings, I made the AI much more difficult and numerous. The main thing though is that I added the nuke cannon to one map, and by nuke cannon I mean nuke cannon. They included it in the editor but not in the game for some reason. Users/RealComputers

20090925 22:10:05 nbsp Best of luck with the new business. Ive been on both ends of cash flow issues for small businesses (as an employee and as an owner), and it stinks. Users/JabberWokky

20091003 23:28:43 nbsp RE: Your request for Events posting: The info I posted is all off a singlepage flyer. I know it is a UCD class, held in a normalsize classroom. The instructor has graciously opened his class up to the public so we may hear from these artists too. For info on the artists, I recommend Googling them (thats what I did). Anything else? Users/SteveDavison

20091130 19:18:08 nbsp Haha, thats too bad. I made a trebuchet with some of my friends in eighth grade, just a random idea at lunch one day... turned into a PVC masterpiece that managed to huck a couple pieces of fruit. Users/JamesM

20091222 15:27:45 nbsp Hey Mason, Users/WilliamLewis just ordered some more wiki stickers.  Would you be willing to help table at farmers market and help kickstart Wiki Community/Outreach the outreach program again? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100713 23:59:14 nbsp Im not saying you cant or shouldnt move the shuttle comments, but I think the reason they are there is that transportation is discussed on the page.  In particular, the page claims that Super Shuttle stops in Sac after Davis but before airport, and some of the comments support or deny that claim.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100714 06:46:32 nbsp If youre sure nobodyll mind, just make the edit (move the comments).  If its controversial, kick up a talk page about it (click the Talk icon).  Sometimes Ill do it before, sometimes after, depending on how controversial it is.  And by controversial, it might simply be something like Im not sure what this is saying; anybody know for sure?.  Talk pages are a way to voice uncertainty and get other peoples input about a specific entry.  Sometimes they are useful when you have a conflict of interest to state your reasons for an edit you made so that people dont just assume some other reason.

Each edit is always a judgement call, with each editor figuring out what they think is best.  If somebody points out an observation you hadnt thought of (like CPs comment above that some of the comments support or deny that claim), think how to take those points into account.  You might edit the main entry to integrate the points from those comments, but the bulk of the comments belong elsewhere, so you move them.  Most active editors voice specific objections, so that helps a good deal.

The only time theres real arguments on the wiki is when somebodys motivation isnt specific, often I want it my way to promote themselves or their business, or perpetual discussion about the more philosophical wiki topics (the hot one recently is if people should use their real names).  Other than that, everybody is pretty united in the goal of improving the wiki: if you see something you can make better, just do it. Users/JabberWokky

20100719 08:39:54 nbsp It also explains why small companies with employees who bond socially and have reasonable latitude (where a day off to see a kids play is a common and accepted request) and pride in their work do better than those that dont.  It satisfies all those requirements.  And they are reasonable requirements  they are basically people who feel like they are accomplishing something want to move forward.  There are some neat studies that he doesnt mention that tie in.  For instance, satisfaction in positions where you never see the result of your work (processing medical papers) is highly dissatisfying.  If you see the end result  positive or negative, you have much higher satisfaction levels.  Id bet (but have not heard of a study that shows) the highest satisfaction is when you see the result and your improvement.  Which ties back into the Mastery aspect hes talking about.

20100807 16:43:02 nbsp Did you see the http://daviswiki.org/Mondavi_Center?actioninfo edit history for the Mondavi Center page?  (Im taking no stand on the issue, just pointing out what has gone before). Users/CovertProfessor

20100807 17:43:15 nbsp Unless your Mr. Burns Users/StevenDaubert

20100807 20:03:21 nbsp No worries, I just thought the context might be helpful.  When I saw yours and SDs edits, I thought, wait, didnt that used to be on the page already?  So I looked at the history, and there it was. Users/CovertProfessor
 P.S. I reworked it a bit  see what you think.  cp
  That reads much more smoothly now, thanks.  Ive had just under 5 hours of sleep in the last 36 hours or so :( MM

20100809 12:13:34 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/University_Commons_Apartments?actiondiff&version2120&version1119 Thank you. I had trouble figuring out a way to say that without completely insulting people  Users/hankim

So glad I looked at your page. I just watched the RSA video link and now have some more interesting things to view for a bit. Thanks for sharing! Users/Wesone Wes

Yeah, the Triple Play package with Comcast Xfinity requires a two year commitment, thats the downside. If you canceled the next month they would probably want the IPod back. Not sure.   I posted the pricing because a lot of people get a lot of different discounts for various reasons and people will try to call and get the deal thinking it is the regular price, when it is not. I just wanted to inform people about the actual cost for recurring and new members to clarify. I myself was paying 39.99/mo. for the fast Internet at the time (16 mbs) but that was because of a problem they had with my account last year and I planned on genuinely canceling until they offered the deal. Now it is back up to 89.99/ mo. Thats the other reason I posted the pricing. Some get different prices and the cost will change with Comcast claiming it is their set rate for nonnew customers and the amount varies. So, in a way, it helps to keep them in check also according to their posted pricing on the net compared to some idiot verbal pricing over the phone. Users/WesP

20100901 12:00:03 nbsp re: http://daviswiki.org/Events_Board nbsp
(1) How does one CORRECT an event entry?  I tried to align an image toward the right, and obviously erred.  (17 October, Arb discussion, top image)
(2) I added a similar event for November 21, but it didnt show up.  The calendar says its for 3 months, so that should now be SeptOctNov; right?
(3) How do I link to a particular date in the Events Calendar from another page?
Any suggestions or help will be appreciated. Users/LoisRichter

20100908 16:03:56 nbsp Sorry to have to disagree a second time (this time on Users/AshleyMatsons page), but again, I think we are disagreeing about what clutter on the Recent Changes amounts to.  To me, clutter is when people make mistake, mistake, mistake  things they would have caught if they previewed  not making small changes one at a time, which can actually make it easier for other editors to follow.  I also had to correct someone who is making productive edits  we seem very short handed these days.  To tell someone who is being productive that they are cluttering seems a bit harsh.  I realize you tried to soften it, but I still think it comes across harsh.  Yes, tell people about clutter who need to be told, but I think we should save that for the more egregious cases.
