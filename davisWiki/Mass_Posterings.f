Now and then there are posters, sometimes theres a lot of them. Sometimes they appear only on bulletin boards and other times they are stapled and taped and tied to everything. Their distribution in the city is covered by Davis Municipal Code/28 Municipal Code Chapter 28, Section 3 Handbills and Petitions.



Some mass posterings/flyering:

  Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion
    Frrrau Schnibbitt
    Pi Day
  Whoevers in charge of Francescas Birthday
  Pac Man postering
  Students for an Orwellian Society
  ASUCD Student Government at UCD tends to result in a sea of red and yellow (and probably green too, starting in the fall) in November and February.
  LUGOD sometimes distributes flyers promoting an upcoming speaker.
