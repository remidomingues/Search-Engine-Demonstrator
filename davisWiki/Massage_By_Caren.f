20090430 21:55:46 nbsp Best massage in the area. Strong hands, smooth technique, very knowledgeable about various sports injuries, tightness
and needs. Caren is a longtime athlete, both as a pro cyclist and ultra runner. Her years of experience both as an athlete
and as a massage therapist pays off in a really excellent massage.  The massage room is newly refurbished and is very
peaceful and warm.  Highly recommended. Users/rbittman

20090511 13:41:11 nbsp I am a very active, athletic, and outdoorsy person guiding outdoor adventures, etc.  I also, unfortunately, spend a lot of time as a deskjockey.  I had back and neck problems for several years prior to moving to Davis and tried lots of different things between Medical Doctors, physical therapists, etc. to keep my body in balance and functioning for all of my activity.  With Carens help over the last almost 6 years, my back and neck issues have become manageable or even almost nonissues.  She is a great person and the best massage therapist Ive ever had.  She is a big reason why I can do what I can do and she helps me live a healthy life.  Very highly recommended!!!! Users/sileneverecunda
