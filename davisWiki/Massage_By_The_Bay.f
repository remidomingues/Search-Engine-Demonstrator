20130330 00:12:04 nbsp I met Emily through her work as a prenatal yoga instructor at Kaya Yoga. I went to her numerous times throughout my pregnancy and she even came to my house for some postnatal massages those first few months.  Between her yoga classes and the massages I credit her for helping me get through pregnancy without the back pain that I sometimes have. I actually felt pretty good throughout the pregnancy despite being an older first time mom. I highly recommend her. She is also incredibly nice. Users/TabathaYang
