Massage Heights is a local business offering massage services.


20140306 16:21:21 nbsp I am going to start out by saying that I have been a member here for a little over  10 months . The location is excellent and the staff is very helpful. The heated massage beds are awesome and the place is always clean. I just renewed my membership for another 6 months. The massage therapists range in experience. I have tried 5 different therapists and really love Lily and Hope. Lily has a nursing background and really makes sure every part of the body is covered. She gives an excellent face and shoulder massage. She is very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to. She really understands how the muscles, body, joints, and bones function . She will also add on awesome elevations like a free foot scrub or cold stone face massage. She goes above and beyond to make sure someone tall like me 64 is comfortable the entire time. I love her hot stone massages ;) Hope is really great if you want a customized massage . She is taller and can really work deep tissue. I felt less pain and more relaxed with her massage. I have also had two facials here, they were ok. Spa central in Davis is better facial wise . I also dont care for Dermalogica. Ok now on to the things I think massage heights could improve upon. The only reason I ended up with a membership here is not because I was pressured but offered a second introductory rate to try the services again. I do not like a hard sell and want the freedom to make my choices based on experiences not pressure. The ladies up front are sweet and helpful but I think they try to hard to sell memberships since most are commission based. Just relax and let people make the choice. I also dont like being pushed on products so often as well. Massage heights has made a few mistakes with booking appointments or not having a therapist show up when scheduled. I will say they did offer free foot scrubs, extra time, or incentives for their mistakes so they are improving customer service and I appreciate that. They do have a high turnover rate as far as staff goes so make sure if you find a therapist you like talk to them and get their thoughts on who would be best suited should they leave because I was really sad to see Becky go. I cannot comment on credit card billing issues since I always pay in cash for membership and services rendered. I did attend their holiday party and take advantage of their holiday special of buy 2 get one free as well as 20 percent off products. The two products I do like are the linen spray and body butter. All in all this us a good place to get a massage and you have a wide array of therapists to choose from. They are open from 9am9pm so hours are very flexible if you work til 6. Take advantage of the free chair massages (2 per month with a membership.) Also one of the most important thing I learned is be generous with tips here please. The therapists are paid by the hour and only 8 dollars. I tip at least $15$25 dollars per 1.5 hr massage. They also just aired an Undercover Boss episode so check that out as well. I overall am a satisfied customer and again Lily or Hope ;) thanks Ladies for making my experience so good. I enjoy being able to take advantage of the free 10 minute chair massages as well. Brandon is a good therapist for reflexology . Users/ElizabethBarthel

20140306 20:46:44 nbsp Is it correct, as stated in Elizabeth Barthels comment, that the massage therapists are paid only $8 per hour?
If so, Im horrified. Users/Chamoudah
