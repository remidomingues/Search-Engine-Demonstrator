There are usually two masseuses (Alaina, and Sara) working, though I think they work on an independent contracting basis. Appointments are not usually available sameday but are usually available within 2 or 3 days.  They dont always return messages (i.e. appointment requests) left on their machine.

The Massage Services massage environment is very peaceful. They use a heated massage table, which is pretty excellent, along with relaxing music, a water fountain and preheated massage lotion. Sessions are available for 1 hr or more. Cost is approximately $60 for a 1 hr session, but coupons are sometimes available outside their office and repeat customers are often given a $5 off coupon for their next session.
