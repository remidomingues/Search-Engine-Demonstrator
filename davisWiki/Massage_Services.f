On occasion there are http://www.kcra.com/news/18543231/detail.html less reputable massage providers.  Spring 380 made news in January, 2009, with a prostitution sting. According to http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28801145/wid/11915773/ another article, Spring 380 is one of four massage businesses that was under suspicion; all four were opened within months prior to being discovered, all four are within a few blocks of the same location, and none are owned locally. The Davis Enterprise covered the story as well (Jan 23, 09 Prostitution Sting Downtown).
