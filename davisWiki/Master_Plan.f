Following is the Toad Hollow Dog Park Master Plan as adopted by the City of Davis Recreation & Park Commission on September 21, 2006. This information was distributed as part of the agenda at the public commission meeting held on that date.

Many thanks must go to both Pat Riley of the City of Davis Recreation & Parks division for coordinating this effort and researching logistics, as well as Bob Cordrey who patiently facilitated the community meetings, contributed his expertise in park design, drafted the plans, researched additional information and presented the plans to the Recreation & Park Commission.


 Introduction 
The Toad Hollow/Core Pond Dog Park Masterplan process has been predicated upon survey results, city staff comments and two publicly noticed masterplan workshops. Based upon this input, and expecially the public inolvement during the two working meetings held on July 6 & 20, the amenities and design of this Masterplan are being forwarded to the city for approval.

 List of Amenities 
The primary features that were incorporated into the Masterplan design, based upon the needs and wishes of dog owners, are briefly described below in no particular order:
 Walking Path  located within the existing fence and around the perimeter of the park, this path will be six (6) feet wide and constructed of slurried/compacted roadbase (AB), which will provide a firm, all weather and accessible surface.
 Precast Concrete Benches  placement of the benches will provide seating around the perimeter of the park as well as several groupings within the existing tree groves.
 Small Dog Area  to provide a comfortable and safe setting for our smaller friends, the small dog area has been incorporated into the southeast corner of the existing park. With its own fencing, the small dog area has access gates into an entrylock from both the park side and the outside. This area will also contain a water station to be extended south from the existing one. An existing grove of trees will shade a grouping of benches in addition to a single bench along the east fence line.
 Kiosk  just outside the park entry gates will be a small kiosk with a bulletin board, lost & found basket and posting of park regulations. This structure shall be constructed of materials which will endure periodic submersion.
 Rinsing Station  located adjacent to the parking bulb, an atgrade deck, constructed of composite material, will be sited over a gravel bed and sump intended to intercept drain water. A self shutting hose bib and short hose will enable owners to rinse dogs, while the use of soaps and disinfectants will be prohibited.
 Trees & Landscaping  new trees have been strategically located around the park fence line and parking lot bulb to shade benches, cars and the entry area. Several large boulders and some drought tolerant plantings will accent the existing approach walk between the parking and park entrance.

 Cost Estimates 
Cost estimates for the various amenities listed above are provided in this section. Since construction drawing and project specifications have as yet to be developed, this cost analysis is based upon general city and industry standards. Limited funding will most likely result in staged implementation, therefore the various amenities have been estimated individually and in no particular order.
