The Mathematical Sciences Building (MSB) is now complete and occupied by members of the Mathematics Department, who moved there in December of 2005 after a few months of unanticipated delay.

Located on campus between Academic Surge, Engineering III and the Crocker Nuclear Lab, this new facility for Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Science and Engineering is where most of the residents of Kerr Hall moved.

Brown construction did well Recycling recycling construction waste. Working with R4 Recycling, they achieved a diversion rate of over 90% of waste generated on site, including concrete, wood, metal and gypsum wall board.

Opinions about the buildings design have been mixed. Math Department staff members and some grad students have been heard to express their admiration at its beauty and amenities, but some of the buildings resident researchers complain that its design doesnt encourage the kind of casual discourse that often leads to fruitful collaboration. Also, it is generally agreed that the elevators in MSB are, as one student put it, the worst new elevators ever. Almost every large room, particularly the big office on the second floor, has a spot in which your voice echoes. Its rather strange and seems like a possible flaw in the buildings construction.

The second floor has a computer lab for students enrolled in certain math and programming classes. The first floor has the Calculus Room, a dropin place for students in the MAT 16 series to get homework and tutoring help.

There are http://gallery.math.ucdavis.edu/building several pictures of the interior and exterior of the building, just after completion.

Here are some floor plans to help navigate the building:

  MSB is heavily airconditioned.  No matter how hot it is outside, I have to wear a sweatshirt in the building to be comfortable.  In fact I keep one in my office to keep me warm.  This is kind of ridiculous considering that temperatures reach the hundreds outside.    Users/EfremRensi
   I second this! Users/NumiaCairaguas
   If anything, its too warm  at least in the parts of the MSB that I go to. Users/RoyWright
   Its freakin cold. Some of the offices are colder than the rest of the building, too. Users/ElizabethZarrindast
