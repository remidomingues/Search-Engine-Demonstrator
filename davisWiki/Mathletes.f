The Mathletes are regular competitors at the weekly trivia nights trivia night at Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias Bar. They tend to go by different names week after week (they are very creative and up to the challenge of integrating the weeks news into a team name), but among trivia regulars they are typically referred to as Mathletes. The Mathletes have won best team name multiple times, leaving their competitors, the bland Canadian Softwood(CS), in the dust.

They are second only to CS in terms of trivia night victories and they commonly place in the top 3. The Mathletes and CS have had several memorable battles, with CS usually ending up on top but only by slim margins.  Ever since their summer 2007 break, however, CS has had trouble living up to their legacy.  The Mathletes, on the other hand, are vitalized by a summer of victories, and ready to swoop in and take the crown.

The Mathletes (a lighthearted bunch) always have a good time, with many members pretty sloshed by the end of the night. Unfortunately, with the loss of a great player, Dr. Bob, the amount of drinking has rapidly curtailed.

On voting day 2008, they got every question right in the first round (for the first time in Trivia Night history).

  The Mathletes are awesome! Despite our own competitiveness, my team was always happy to see them in the top 3 they seemed like an easygoing and fun group.  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071023 19:22:57 nbsp The best part about being a mathlete is not caring whether or not you win, or whether or not you are anyones favorite.  We have so much fun, we now have two math teams! Users/BobSled

20071024 10:51:37 nbsp After a few more performances like last nights, someone should remove the remark above about the Mathletes commonly placing in the top 3. Users/colte94

20071025 21:17:45 nbsp I have yet to meet everyone on the Canadian Softwood team, but with the way they trash talk, I cant imagine why I would ever want to. Everytime I have joined the Mathletes at Sophias, they have always done the best they can, and have had fun doing it. It is unfortunate that people go to Trivia Night in the hopes of bringing people down, instead of just trying to have a good time. Yeah for the Mathletes, and the spirit for which they play!
