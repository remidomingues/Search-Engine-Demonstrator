20070516 07:41:13 nbsp Ive used them once and was very satisfied.  Matt was quick and courteous.  Although he did rotate the deadbolt knob 90 degrees, which was confusing for a few days.  But it was broken and now it works great. Users/EdHenn

20070823 00:25:33 nbsp My roommate got locked out of his room at around midnight, and we happen to live about a block away from where the service truck is parked. He called and he quoted $70, and figured itd be cheaper to break his lock off and replace it. Users/DaveSchukin

20071009 16:29:35 nbsp I ended up loosing my key to my apartment and to the apartment mailbox, so I call him up. He charges $70 just for coming out, $10 for the front door, and $15 to do the mailbox. It seems outrageously pricey. Users/AlexNelson
