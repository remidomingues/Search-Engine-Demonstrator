Hello, Im  Matthew Blair and Im a Class of 2011 Political science and History majors double major. I like video games because Im a nerd. Also, I spend far too much time on the 3rd floor of the MU.

As student who was in the UCDC UC Washington Program, I encourage anyone looking into the program to partake in it. Its a great program and a very enriching experience.

20081104 08:22:42 nbsp Animals that are fed with total crap, think GMO, full of pesticides, not fit for human consumption, lots of hormones and chemicals, etc, are not going to give you health. Theyll take retribution from your organs. I try and eat local, organic, weather its meat or veggies, which basically means I dont eat out much. Users/PxlAted
  Lets be fair here: GMO is not in any way more dangerous for human consumption than any other plants, and are often better, because they have been specifically designed that way. Also, chemicals is about as generic a term you can get, and doesnt really mean much of anything. I dont mean to attack the point youre trying to make, but your argument will be made stronger by using actual facts and data, rather than just ominous terms like not fit for human consumption.
