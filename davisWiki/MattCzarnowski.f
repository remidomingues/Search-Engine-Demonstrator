20071127 20:19:57 nbsp I typed a long reply and then got distracted and closed the tab.  Quick summary: Yes, comment was specific to Davis, lived other places with good cult audiences, have experience specific to cult movie audiences sucking Davis, but was several years ago. Sacto pretty good, and college town benefits from constantly rolling over people so situation always in flux.  Found future wife via cult movies in Davis, many good friends via Rocky Horror in NorCal, so happy about that.  This sounds like a telegraph, but damned if Ill type the verbose version in again. Cool sombreros, even cooler poster, ceiling flocking rocks. Users/JabberWokky

20071128 18:58:03 nbsp Matt, unfortunately I dont think Davis has a huge indie/artsy/moviepeople crowd. I might be wrong but at least I am willing to bet $8~$10 ticket charge will keep some of them from regular attendance (not that theres anything especially wrong w/ the price).
I am hoping Varsity can be like Red Vic, but thats not going to happen anytime soon. Users/il
