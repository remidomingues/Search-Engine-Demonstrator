>Here I am on the coast in Kusadasi on our last trip to Turkey in 2007.  The http://www.turkuazguide.net The Turkish Coast is my favorite place in the world: <

Everything on the coast of Turkey from Izmir to Antalya is absolutely amazing in its beauty and culture both ancient and modern.

Destinations on the Turkish coast include:

http://www.allaboutturkey.com/izmir.htm Izmir which used to be called Smyrna in preOttoman era.  This is the Agora, the Greek marketplace, preserved as a tourist park


This is overlooking the city of Izmir; Izmir is Turkeys most cosmopolitan city where Turks, Greeks, Jews and Armenians have been living together since the Byzantine era


http://www.bodrumbodrum.com Bodrum is famous for its Venetian Castle:

http://www.allaboutturkey.com/fethiye.htm Fethiye is very famous as a destination for Aegean and Mediterranean yachtsman

http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/WhereToGo/Mediterranean/Marmaris/MarmarisMain.html Marmaris is another famous yachting destination:

http://www.antalyaws.com/english/location/antalya/about.asp Antalya is one of Turkeys largest ports in the South.  This is on the road to the Greek ruins of Perge and Aspendos, north of Antalya:

http://www.allaboutturkey.com/kusadasi.htm Kusadasi is on the Aegean coast, west of Izmir near Selcuk; This was the view from our hotel towards the port of Kusadasi:



http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul Istanbul although not on the coast, is one the most magnificant and historical cities on the face of the earth.

The best thing about Turkey is the dozens of archeological sites.  The coast of modern Turkey was the location of the ancient Greek colonies of Ionia and Iilyria. You can find two of the Ancient Wonders of the world here including the http://sailturkey.com/panoramas/ephesus/ Library at Ephesus, the http://www.unmuseum.org/maus.htm Mausoleum of Halicarnassus.

Archeological sites I have visited include:

The ancient ampitheater of http://www.whitman.edu/theatre/theatretour/aspendos/aspendos.htm Aspendos, located near Antalya,  which can seat up to 15,000 people:


The ancient city of http://www.adiyamanli.org/aspendos.html Perge, also outside of Antalya, which legend states was founded by refugees from Troy after their defeat by the Greeks:




The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora Agora of Izmir.  This is the preserved Greek ruins in the Turkish city of Izmir:






The http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Library_at_Ephesus.html Library at Ephesus.  The Ephesus site is one the largest preservations of Ancient Greek ruins in the world:
