Are you sure that McKenzie Drive is the right address? I cant seem to get it to work with the map application, or find it on Google Maps. Users/GeoffJohnson

20100704 00:05:21 nbsp Check out wiki:Dixon. It is the wiki for Dixon and it needs pages about things like wiki:dixon:Squirty Records. Users/JasonAller

20121016 10:30:14 nbsp Hey, Matt... have you seen the questions over on Pleasant Valley Music/Talk?  Were trying to figure out if PVM is a storefront, mail order, by appointment or what.   Users/JabberWokky

Hey Matt,  I just checked the addy at Switchboard.com for Squirty Records, the name by which Pleasant Valley Music used to be known. (did you rename the business, or buy it out, perhapsPleasant Valley Music is a much more melodious name than the former, IMHO :). It appears that the formerly named businesss address was:

640 McKenzie Drive
Dixon, CA

The map on Switchboard reveals this to be a residential neighborhooddo you operate your recording studio business out of your home perhaps?
Thanks in advance for the info and good luck with PVM, the music biz is tough enough these daze, eh?
