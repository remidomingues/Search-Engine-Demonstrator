Using an asr10 as a canvas, samples as paint, drum loops as  brushes, The Nothing blends JAZZ, classical, and world beat  influences and creates HIP HOP BEATS that are musical works  of art. Following in the same vein as RJD2 and hailing from  Davis, CA (hometown of fellow artist DJ SHADOW), Matt Fisher, aka: The Nothing, was raised on jazz and blues. At 13 he  found hiphop and never looked back, spending his adolescence with HIEROGLYPHICS, TRIBE, DE LA SOUL, and KRS ONE.

Now THE NOTHING has hooked up with likeminded artists all  with one goal: making music simply for the love of it.  Fisher has been lucky enough to work with one of underground hiphops  best: LUCKYIAM.PSC of the LIVING LEGENDS.  PSC used seven  of The Nothings beats for his 2003 release EXTRA CREDIT 2: SUMMER SCHOOL. This album boasted a roster of underground  greats such as DJ DSTYLES of the World Famous BEAT JUNKIES,  and emcees ACEYALONE and THE GROUCH, both of whom  appear on The Nothing track The Wise.  With his first solo release THE NOTHING has taken his multifaceted background  and woven it into a soothing DOWNTEMPO musical experience.


key selling points: This album has received airplay on many college and indepen dent radio stations, including the influential KDVS (Davis, CA),  KCSB (Santa Barbara, CA), KCSF (San Francisco, CA), plus 50  other college radio stations in California Appearing on the Vans Warp tour as DJ for El Jefe Shares the tracklisting on KDVSs Hip Hop Compilation with  other artists such as JLIVE, DJ DNA and the FENOM CIRCLE.   This album is being sent to every college radio station in America On a mission to bring back jazzy hiphop, this album represents  his unique view of music in general, and certainly confirms one  thing: While the name may be misleading, The Nothing is  certainly something  fans of DJ KRUSH, BUCK 65, DJ CAM, and KRUDER  & DORFMEISTER will like this album
