Hello, fellow wikians, my name is Matt and I am a major Davis Foodie. My favorite activities include eating at all the various restaurants in Yolo region. For a list of the way I rank all the Davis restaurants (well the ones ive been to, which is about 98% of them) see Matts Restaurant Rankings.

I just graduated from UC Davis and TAed for a course on Chaos and Fractals in the summer of 2008 at UC wiki:SantaCruz. I am currently in graduate school at wiki:Ithaca:Cornell University in wiki:Ithaca, NY. I almost satisfied my goal of trying all the restaurants in town.

Unusual Facts about Matt
  I am obsessed with keeping track of running stats
  I chose UC Davis over UC Berkeley and UCLA (because UCD had the greatest number of majors and offered more internships/research opportunities)
  I enjoy a few weird flavor combinations (enchiladas with fish sauce anyone?)
  I enjoy the 6 hour drive down I5 to LA
  I have a twin brother users/jbh
  I often like to think about social issues and moral philosophy. My positions are constantly changing.

School stuff: I graduated from UC Davis in June 2008 earning a B.S. in Mathematics Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity. While at Davis I served as a tutor and tutor trainer for the Learning Skills Center, a researcher and mentor for the CLIMB program, and an undergraduate representative for the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. During graduation i received the UC Davis University Medal. Courses I took while at Davis included matts courses these (you can look at this just in case youd like academic advice or would like to strike up an academic conversation with me. By the way, especially strike up an academic conversation with me if the topic is completely unrelated to any course i took :). )




20060607 18:24:19 nbsp Yes, that was indeed me TAing for the geometry class. I apologize if my grading was a bit harsher than Dr. Gee had intended or than you were expecting, but Im very glad to hear that my comments made a differencein the long run, learnings more important than grades anyway. As for folding paper in a curveits a bit difficult to describe without actually showing you, but the basic idea is that instead of holding the corner in place while you crease the bend, you slide said corner slowly across the page. In general, the crease line is perpendicular to the segment from the corners original position to the corners new position, but if the corner is moving, then said perpendicular is continuously changing direction, so you get a curve instead of a straight line!

20061002 14:54:44 nbsp My name is D.J. and I am a senior at Davis Senior High School. I am taking Journalism 1 and we have to do an indepth article. My topic is the red light cameras put up in Davis at select intersections. I saw your opinion that you posted about the cameras and I was wondering if I could quote you. I doubt my article will get into the school newspaper but if it were selected, I would ask you first. If I can quote you, I would need your full last name. Thanks, D.J. Users/DaAg

20061106 18:20:46 nbsp Math 23? Well, not officially; it was more of a Discordian joke. Note the professor listed on http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~phoenix/index23.html the course website. I do offer cheap tutoring in numerology for interested parties though. Users/BarnabasTruman

20070114 16:33:29 nbsp hello matt....village bakery employee here just reporting in: we do still love you...sorry there wasnt enough bread yesterday. Users/LexiHudson

20070224 12:00:44 nbsp Is there a Xebra in town, or is this just an advertising link? They dont seem to be available for sale yet. Users/JabberWokky

20070224 18:45:29 nbsp Are you sure it wasnt the Little Green Electric Car thats often parked there? Users/JabberWokky

20070225 10:36:55 nbsp Cool.  If you spot it again (thus semiconfirming its a local car), it should probably get an entry to itself, if for no other reason than to add a photo request. Users/JabberWokky

20070301 23:58:19 nbsp Matt I want to invite you to my restaurant, Its called Ono Teriyaki.  We serve Hawaiian and Japanese Food.  Our address is 10 N East ST in woodland.  Email me at rtaura@yahoo.com and I can send you a menu.  Users/RobertTaura

20070321 12:09:35 nbsp Kaveri used to be a lot better, its gone downhill from its peak. Slightly better than anything in Davis, but nothing compared to the Bay Area. By the way, whats Math 108 like? Its a required course for CS majors, so I have to take it. Users/TusharRawat

20070321 23:06:38 nbsp Thanks, Matt! I already turned in my application, actually, so maybe Ill see you next year. Will you still be affiliated with CLIMB? I didnt know about the seminars counting as restricted electives. I knew that BIS 132 counted, but if more of the classes count then thatd be really nice. Im watching my units so I dont go over. Users/NumiaCairaguas

20070323 09:57:46 nbsp Howdy, Matt. I zipped through your reviews and did a bit of spelling fixes.  I know this is your personal entry, I just saw you had done some fixes recently, and figured Id lend a hand. Feel free to revert, it was intended as a friendly assist. Users/JabberWokky

20070405 11:59:21 nbsp Matt, were you in Stones again today at lunch? Users/DavidGrundler

20070409 17:47:27 nbsp Hello, Matt. I was wondering what the CLIMB application interviews are like, do you think you could give me a headsup. My email is tsrawat AT ucdavis DOT edu Users/TusharRawat

20070419 08:52:31 nbsp Hi, Matt. I just looked at Users/BryceHathaways page and saw your request to use our photo of the CLIMB room window. Youre welcome to use it on the CLIMB page. Users/RebeccaWan

20070520 22:08:56 nbsp Thanks! :) Users/NumiaCairaguas

20070522 22:47:20 nbsp Thanks! Users/TusharRawat

20070830 18:28:59 nbsp I think you and I just conflicted with the same edit.  I believe... I did a revert at the same time you did an edit, which does not show edit conflicts.  I though the revert didnt work, so I repeated it again, which then seemed to work.  I was trying to remove the or not, and your comment (which would thus be no longer applicable), and refix the leeway issue that CovertProfessor caught.  Regardless, I did the initial edit and was iffy about it at the time (I dont recall why, and I wouldnt do it now), and I retracted it.  Youre right  it winds up being wordy and wishywashy. Users/JabberWokky

20070921 23:51:15 nbsp Im not sure what happened to the file, but my undergraduate thesis is now working properly, in case you have a semimasochistic desire to delve into it.  : ) Users/AaronRosenberg

20070930 23:04:03 nbsp Hey, Matt. There is an easy way to get to the Yolo Fruit Stand from westbound I80 coming from West Sac. See direction additions to their Yolo Fruit Stand page. Users/robinlaughlin

20071112 17:26:19 nbsp Thanks, it was my #1 choice of school/program. Im lovin it! Users/KarlMogel

20071126 10:15:35 nbsp Hey, Matt. I dont check my personal web page very often, so I just now read your message. Im tickled, actually, that you wanted to use our photograph of the flamingoes and am happy that you credited Rebecca and me as the photographers. Users/BryceHathaway

20071226 22:54:55 nbsp For what it is worth (and you may well know this already, so feel free to disregard this), sweet onions are actually a type of onion, not a description.  Sort of like how red onions arent actually red, but are actually purple.  Sweet onions (like Vidalia and Maui) are a bit sweeter and have a different texture, but still have a sharpness and bite to them when raw.  They roast quite a bit differently. Users/JabberWokky

20080105 01:00:04 nbsp The power outage entry is a friggin awesome idea... I renamed the stub, fleshed it out a bit and added it to the front page as a community alert. Users/JabberWokky

20080323 10:28:56 nbsp can you give a citation or something about sugar not giving quick energy? thats a pretty popular piece of  (folk?) wisdom youre arguing against Users/CraigBrozinsky

20080325 16:43:25 nbsp Howdy Matt!  Spanks for the soup compliment.  Your restaurant page is amaaazing. Youre not messing around calling yourself a major Davis Foodie.  Yes, I hope to see ya sometime this summer at the stand but if Im not there, Id like to, in advance, recommend the Kaffir Limemade (layers of lime flavor with a creamy smoothness) or the Mint Arnold Palmer (minty, refreshing, and clean on the palate) for your first pop!  Users/PopsicleGirl

20080331 17:48:59 nbsp Im really glad you enjoyed my suggestion! I always suggest things to friends but I worry it wont transfer because of the subjectivity of taste. Despite that, I think the cheese is a decent and moderately priced deal at Tucos (especially if youre going with 34 people. The portions on the small plates will not be enough to be made into a meal mind you, but try the Lamb Meatballs or the Carrot Chachapas. For Larger Plates I like Bison Tenderloin or the Feijoada. It seems theyve changed the menu around a bit and I havent been in a 23 months so theres plenty that may be good or bad I dont have an opinion on.  Users/AlvinTsao

20080331 18:19:41 nbsp haha, I was voting when you sent me the message. I had to add a lot of businesses to some categories I dont know if that changes anyones votes. I know its subjective but god help me if Hunan wins best Chinese.  Users/AlvinTsao

20080413 02:03:26 nbsp Thanks for adding to the Nutritional Science page and fixing my assumption gone wrong. Do you visit the undergrad room in MSB often, cause you look very familiar. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080421 14:05:50 nbsp Sorry for the late reply... yes, I am missing Kabul, too.  I feel the same way  should have gone there more often.  And there is (or is going to be?) a Japanese restaurant there?  Dont get me wrong, I love Japanese food, but I cant see where this town needs another Japanese restaurant. Users/CovertProfessor

20080502 20:26:00 nbsp hey, sorry to be a wikistalker but what did you think of the CLIMB program, if you dont mind me asking? p.s., i love your restaurant ranking page. i mostly agree out of the ones ive been to and can now use it in the future to find good restaurants. Users/MiranPark

20080504 21:13:57 nbsp thanks for your input. im actually a physics major, but dr. hom said shes found ways to accommodate me into the program if im accepted. it seems pretty relevant and i feel like ill be able to take a lot away from it since i want to go to grad school in biophysics or computational biology or something. again, thanks. if youre not busy is there any way you could give me a general outline of how many hours it is per week each quarter? i understand there are certain classes you have to take but other than that im not sure how much of a time commitment it is.  Users/MiranPark

20080505 00:45:27 nbsp thanks for the heads up. if i do get accepted and additionally participate in climb ill be sure to only take my physics core classes. thanks again.  Users/MiranPark

20080516 02:28:42 nbsp hiya matt, just saw your village bakery ques, the list also refers to vendors i use for my brunch items as well.  i use their ciabatta rolls, baguettes, and sliced bread for my sammiches.  but maybe one day ill sneak some sticky buns in the pops...  Users/PopsicleGirl

20080608 19:19:50 nbsp Thanks for the input, Matt. Ive always needed to work on my stage presence and presentation. Sue Greenwald talked to me the other day at Farmers Market about how I was pretty much deadon with the issues during the campaign (especially since I was not an incumbent so I did not have as easy of access to a lot of the info and I had no one coaching me or helping with my literature) but she thinks joining Toast Masters would do me well because Im rather rough around the edges when it comes to public speaking. Im sorry that influenced your decision but I can only promise you that Ill work to improve my presentation. Users/RobRoy

20080616 21:08:00 nbsp I appreciate your taking the initiative on deleting that pageit was zugzwang for both parties. Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20080621 07:01:43 nbsp Just read your comments about Red Orchid (I was there on opening day). I totally agree with your review, isnt it frustrating how Davis cant get a decent Dim Sum place with an actual Dim Sum menu outside of the frozen aisle section? Shabu Shabu was decent though (but if you want the best stuff get one of the machines and do it up yourself with an Asian friend).  Users/AlvinTsao

20080626 23:18:36 nbsp Thanks for adding my comment box, youd think someone who knows HTML would be able to figure out Wiki a little quicker but apparently not... lol anyway, because of your page Im aware of the new dim sum/shabu shabu place in Davis. Im not expecting a lot (I unfairly compare dim sum to San Francisco, and shabu shabu to Japan itself) but Ill be trying it anyway now that Im aware of its existance! Great restaurant reviews too... El Paisano Taco Truck and New Canton look like my next stops, gas money allowing... Users/SRB

20080812 14:11:56 nbsp You might want to consider the discussion going on at Chipotle/Talk.  Also, McDonalds is not MacDonalds. Users/JabberWokky

20081118 11:50:28 nbsp How about expanding on that?   Users/Zabadu

20101022 07:12:16 nbsp Neat sounding research! Users/JabberWokky
