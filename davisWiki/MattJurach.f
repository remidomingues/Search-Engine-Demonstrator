Matt Jurach is a former KDVS KDVS DJs DJ, hosting the Christian Noise Show for several years in the 1990s (all Christian thrash, punk, grindcore and industrial bands) as well as the shortlived Kick Acid Jazz Show.

Matt Jurach was also Users/RobRoys third grade summer camp instructor as well as Sunday school teacher in middle school at Arcade Baptist Church in Sacramento.

He was also a part of the Davis Fire Crew from 19952003, and still pours drinks at their endofseason parties...

Macka likes chewing on Matts plants and causing other miscellaneous havoc.

If you saw some goateed madman riding through town on a Big Red Radiocycle big red radiocycle, screaming at cars while blaring KDVS, that was probably Matt.

After spending 15 years in Davis, Matt moved to Sacramento in September, 2006.  Of everything he misses from Davis, the wiki tops the list.

20060113 08:13:25 nbsp I just want to know how you could find out that the SHF Rice Dryer was owned by Dunes Casinos. Users/SteveDavison
 Google is truly amazing.  I just googled SHF and the street address from their sign.  That got me to http://www.business.com/directory/real_estate_and_construction/commercial_construction/dunes_hotels_and_casinos/profile/ this, and I was off to the races.BRMy next target is that wierd building at the end of Second Street by the Mace overcrossing.  Anyone have any idea what that is?
    Amazing. And nobody would have ever suspected those towers were full of coins.

20060113 12:01:00 nbsp I think you are talking about the old headquarters from the Mace Ranch. An old building just in the corner of the overpass? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060122 20:59:59 nbsp Hola Matt.   Users/GeorgeLewis

20060125 09:48:01 nbsp Do you have any more info for the Davis Dance Project? Such as: who puts it on, is there a website, what was your source of info (flyer, etc.) I couldnt find any Google reference or any second ref. to confirm date/time/price, etc. Users/SteveDavison
 http://pages.sbcglobal.net/ptdwdt/DavisDanceProject2006.htm Source, linked from the http://trokanski.com Trokanski Dance website.  They are the organizers.

20070106 17:52:18 nbsp Too bad about the hive. I was going to remove it... but the grounds people werent getting the paperwork to me in time. Users/KarlMogel

20071026 09:49:16 nbsp Hey, Matt... since you seem to know about them, it might be a good idea to do up the Featured Page as a guide to local corn mazes, at least now until Halloween. Users/JabberWokky

20071107 12:27:13 nbsp Walmart would make a good featured page, but I think the blurb is needlessly inflamatory.
I think it makes sense that there is a walmart page on the wiki, and the fact communities ALL across the world refuse to allow wal mart in their communities is not narrow minded.  Users/PxlAted

20080710 16:35:23 nbsp Nifty idea with the Room 1337 page. As far as I know there is only one room number 666 on campus if you are willing to accept 0666 rather than the exact match. Users/JasonAller

20090317 12:12:31 nbsp I think theres usually a tendency for a bit of pushback from the community at large in reaction to stubborn and silent behavior.  Im not sure its a useful response in this particular case, but it is what it is: theres no organized effort going on, its just the social reaction to a particular repeated action.  To several peoples credit, there have been various compromises proposed by rewriting and restructuring things that were also deleted without any communication. Users/JabberWokky

20110207 21:59:38 nbsp Mt Hoods Only did ok, but with only one season to reference I am hopeful they will pick up this season! They certainly did not perform like cascades did in their first yeat, the gold standard as far as I can tell.  I think we harvested 11.5 pounds of Mt hoods from 6 plants. In cascades first year, I got about that much from each plant!  You a brewer I presume?  You should come check out the Greenbelt brewers if you are interested  in a homebrew club.    Users/matiasek
