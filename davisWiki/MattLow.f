20110828 17:04:23 nbsp Hey, I moved the stuff about Frank back onto the Olive Drive Barber entry because it seems pretty short and is basically just a history section.  Id agree that it would make sense on a separate entry if there were a ton of reviews, but the whole thing takes up one short section and is directly relevant to the history of the shop, so it makes more sense there.  Plus there seems to be a few people who also want Franks history there mentioned. If theres a reason to pop it out that Im missing, feel free to make it clear.

20110828 19:19:53 nbsp Eh, I dunno.  It makes it seem more like a business listing than a community celebration of the topic to omit peoples views on somebody who was there for four decades.  Its a soft and squishy thing: Frank was a part of the community for a long time in a particular position, so it seems like there should be prominent recognition of that. Users/JabberWokky
