Howdy Matt.  Next time you see something wrong on the wiki, just go ahead and correct it.  The only reason the price on Kathmandu Kitchen was off was because nobody had noticed until you did.  All the info there was put there by normal wiki editors like you.  By the way, theres no entry for the Pooja Indian Grill, and you seem to like it, so go ahead and create one! Users/JabberWokky jw
