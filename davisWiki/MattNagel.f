Matt Nagel graduated with an American Studies major at UC Davis. He was a cashier at the Coffee House for a long time, and he still loves the California Aggie Marching BandUh BandUh. He left in May of 2006, but he still loves Davis far too much for his own good. He now works for a PR firm in San Francisco.

Finally, Matt has the same birthday as Users/ThomasFifield Thomas Fifield, Derek Tripp, and a bouncer at the Mercantile.
