20090424 18:53:23 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for registering under your real name. Weve had a lot of problems recently with people using Role Accounts that diminish the creation of a sense of Wiki Community community here on the wiki. For instance Users/CampusRec someone created a role account for Campus Recreation, but in doing so they created some real problems. If that account is shared between users it may be a violation of campus cybersafety policies and good practices, and if it is being used by only one person then they are contributing to a growing problem here on the wiki with Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Role Accounts. Either way there are now two pages with information purporting to tell users about Campus Recreation and Users/CampusRec. The other issue it raises is that if someone else comes along and registers Users/CampusRecreation and starts announcing events that dont exist and defaming the Chancellor no one will know if that account is really an official spokeperson for Campus Recreation or just a kook who isnt willing to stand behind their words with their importance of using your RealName. By registering with a real name, or a pseudonym and establishing an identity the issue of Role impersonation is reduced. Users/JasonAller

20100521 15:48:13 nbsp No worries... thats why I asked.  Cooperative editing often involves a bit of communication, especially since we all mistakenly stomp over somebody elses edits from time to time.  Ill flip it back now.  Thanks for the contribution, by the way. Users/JabberWokky

20100521 18:45:14 nbsp (re: http://daviswiki.org/Users/JabberWokky?actiondiff&version21585&version11584 your comment on the wokks page) A redirect would probably be more appropriate (though Im pretty sure that was what you were actually referring to by link). Redirects are frequently invoked to http://daviswiki.org/Physics_and_Geology?actionshow restore continuity to renamed pages, http://daviswiki.org/Hutchinson_Drive?actionshow correct common misspellings, and http://daviswiki.org/LAWR?actionshow serve as shorthand for inline hyperlinks. Of course, they are certainly not limited to these uses, and if you feel that creating a redirect on 100 Dollar Coupon Book would help, you are certainly free to do so. (Heres the http://daviswiki.org/Templates/Redirect?actionshow redirect template, by the way.) Users/EBT
  I just created one (didnt see your comment here, EBT).  If you go to 100 Dollar Coupon Book, you are now redirected. jw
