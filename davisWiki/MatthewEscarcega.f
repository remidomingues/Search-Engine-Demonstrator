20080909 22:21:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Matthew, and Welcome to the Wiki!     My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I uploaded a version of the logo you tried to upload as a pdf to the Theatre and Dance, but it looks like there is also a UCD Theatre & Dance Dept. entry as well.  They should probably be combined into one entry with Department spelled out.  Usually the UCD is dropped from the front as well.  If you need any help, just ask!
