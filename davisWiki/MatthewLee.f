Originally from Alameda, California, this 3rd year seeks a Biochemistry degree under the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology Molecular & Cellular Biology. After taking Chem118B with the uber cool http://wwwchem.ucdavis.edu Dr. Neil E. Schore, Chemistry changed his life.  He switched from a http://nutrition.ucdavis.edu Nutritional Biochemistry major to a Biochemistry major. 

But dont get him wrong, science majors are more well rounded that you think.  He is an avid learner of languages, and is currently learning Svenska and Hindi.  Next year, he will be taking Mandarin to satisfy his language deprivation.  His main focus is: talar svenska jättebra, or speak Swedish damn well.  Hes fluent in Cantonese and pretty good with the Spanish, Portuguese (naturally! due to the ajacentness of Macau to China), and somewhat with conversational Mandarin (thats why Im taking it next quarter!).

His music tastes are weird.  He rarely listens to English music.  His favorites include http://www.lenaphilipsson.se Lena Philipsson, http://helenapaparizou.com Helena Paparizou, and http://www.portalmix.com/beth Beth de Op. Triunfo II en Esp.

He enjoy playing computer games such as http://www.pogo.com POGO, http://www.vmk.com Virtual Magic Kingdom, and http://games.yahoo.com Yahoo! Games.  He pretty much is a kid at heart because all he does is goof around with friends and family.  He never gets good studying done, because he goofs and jokes around all the damn time.  It annoys his friends because he isnt too serious about the studies, but theyre cool with it since laughter heals sadness...

Currently spinning on his playlist is: Lena Philipssons Det Gor Ont (It hurts), Swedens Eurovision song for the year 2004.  It is superb.  Yall should download it and bask the GREATNESS of Swedish culture and language.
