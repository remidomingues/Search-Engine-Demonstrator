Hey Matthew, Id say welcome to the wiki, but it looks like youve been around for awhile. I took your comment and put the info up in the header.  It looks like you tried with the email and got confused; no worries... the great thing about the wiki is that there are a ton of people to help.  I find that clicking the Edit icon is often easier for things like tables rather than double clicking to edit. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
