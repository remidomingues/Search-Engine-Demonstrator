Has unfortunately/fortunately graduated from the university, and has moved elsewhere. May be working at a museum (maybe not so) near you, or maybe even working for the Feds, or the state government.


His additions to the Wiki about wildlife have been particularly interesting.  Thanks on behalf of those of us whove learned things.  :)  Users/JudithTruman

20060820 13:03:44 nbsp Howdy, Matthew... Id suggest that you dont just add comments to entries when you have information, just go ahead and edit the entry itself, especially when its good information.  Another helpful thing is to go back and integrate comments that people have left on wiki entries to make a more complete main article.  It is, of course, up to you... but look at the Honeybees article for an example of inclusion of your comment into the entry (people can now add info about the Syrphid fly and possibly eventually break it own into a whole new entry with a link) versus Measure X, which is primarily composed of comments and difficult to both read and edit.
