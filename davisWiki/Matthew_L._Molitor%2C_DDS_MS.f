20100129 10:11:59 nbsp I take my son to Dr. Molitor and I refer many of my own patients who need orthodontics to his practice.  Dr. Molitor has a very warm and friendly personality, he knows how to connect with people and make them feel listened to and appreciated.  From a clinical standpoint he is very detailed oriented, I have seen great results in our patients.  One of the things I appreciate most is that he takes the time to review all the possible options and outcomes with his patients (including not doing orthodontics) so that they can make informed decisions.

20100515 20:16:17 nbsp I have been referring patients to Dr. Molitor for over ten years and have been very happy with the warm and caring way they are treated and with the great results.  Dr. Molitor’s entire team is friendly and kids enjoy going to his office.  Each patient’s case (including both children and also adults) is treatment planned individually with care and sophistication.  Various treatment options are explained to patients, including the option of not having orthodontics.  This is especially important in planning complex cases, an area where Dr. Molitor excels.  My oldest daughter just finished her orthodontic treatment with Dr. Molitor and is thrilled at the results.  Her orthodontic case was complex and Dr. Molitor did an awesome job.  Thank you!
