Matthew Zweig is a coordinator for the Davis Campus ACLU and social chair of AGASA.  But when asked about these positions Mazzy says Oh really?  Thats me?  I didnt know that.  He does currently work at Creative Media.

He is a lover of the finer things in life.  Things such as what no manfearing person can go without, the great American novel Catch 22, the courageous movie Fight Club and well an amazing band called Freezepop.

When asked to describe himself he replies with what most consider to be a rather apt description of: Ive been labeled a Hippy Nerd before and I guess it fits fairly well, As with all labels, it doesnt come close to actually describe the full picture.

Next year he will be living with Users/JasmineLau two Users/KirstenOnell girls. He is a fan of Eddie Izzard and should therefore be commended.
