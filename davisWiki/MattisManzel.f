This seems to be a pretty nice wiki with a good community. Id like to point you to something that might interest you. There is a collaborative editing program called MoonEdit. Up to 14 people can write simultaneously on a page (lin+win only for now). We started on ting sessions. There is a page citywikis on the server isroot.de where you can try it out  maybe start on regular Davistings?. Everybody is surely welcome to global tings. http://s23.org/wiki/index.php/TingWiki tingwiki. BR
Recently ting have been announced and archived on the http://communitywiki.org/odd/CollabEditor/FrontPage collabeditorwiki.
