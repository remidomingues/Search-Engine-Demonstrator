Its going on, right now in YOUR Davis

What have Users you done lately to make a mature Davisite (or anyone else for that matter) aware of the All Pages power and Davis Wiki in one sentence ease that is Davis wiki (and by extension wiki:wikispot Wikispot?

http://vimeo.com/12555175 {{{<}}} and http://localwiki.org could be powerful weapons in the quest to get more mature Davisites on the wiki!
   The photo/url voyage segment is being extracted for use in the Davis Wiki.  Thanks to Jason for the photographs, and whoever (Paul? Philip?) animated it. jw
    That would be a great moving image for this page, but I really like the video as its a primer for more than the Daviswiki, The audio goes smoothly with the video and imparts the concept nicely Daubert
      Yep... Im just saying that the master tracks will be available so we can use it in specific presentations in the future. jw
In the last 2 weeks Ive given at least 5 primers to Mature Davisites who were unaware of the wiki and how kewl it was!
I also introduced the DW concept to a few business owners in the past month!
