Were everywhere.

Were at the Davis Senior Center Senior Center, were at the Upscale Restaurants, were in line at the Supermarkets, at the Parks, running our Dogs dogs in the dog park, riding on the Bike Paths, attending local Churches.

We volunteer with Citizens Who Care and other charity organizations.  We attend theatrical events, especially the yearly Citizens Who Care http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/care/Concert.html Winter Concert and the Davis Musical Theatre Co. shows.

The only place where we arent Mature Davisite Wiki Recruitment Drive broadly represented yet, is on Davis Wiki.

Many of us have already raised our families, so we arent found at Schools school activities, or up to date with the Davis Music Scene local music scene. But were an important part of the town social structure. I hope that more of the mature Davisites will find this web site and make their presence known.


20041209 13:42:54 nbsp I have to say some of the best experiences Ive had in this town have been conversing with the many open minded older folks who live here. I think intergenerational dialouge is highly important and I hope to see more of it on this site.  Users/DanMasiel

20041209 13:59:57 nbsp I absolutely agree with the above comment.  We are especially hoping to promote interaction between Davisites and UCD students.  Users/MikeIvanov

20041212 16:18:38 nbsp How long does it take a Davisite to mature? I know quite a few who are above the magical age of 40 who are still raising their families, or for that matter, have just started one. I know many who wouldnt call themselves mature yet either! As for me, you can count me as semimature; Im not a UCD student, but Im under 40 still.  Users/CentralDavisite
