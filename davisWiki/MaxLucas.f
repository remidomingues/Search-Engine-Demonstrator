Max Lucas once accidentally got locked in a vending machine room in the middle of the night. He escaped by climbing out of a window.



20090213 19:12:23 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Did something change recently with DHL, Ive used OfficeMax to send things DHL in the past? Users/JasonAller

20090213 19:31:01 nbsp DHL is ending all express delivery in the US and laying off most of its workers in the country. Users/MaxLucas

20090326 07:46:05 nbsp Hi Max. I really appreciate your recent edits on the Chico Wiki!  Thanks!! Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090429 22:01:54 nbsp I have absolutely no will power in avoiding cheese.  But the idea of an animalproduct free lifestyle has always been appealing to me. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090430 06:54:49 nbsp Yes that is about where I stand.  Im a bit flexible but do avoid meat a large percentage of the time.  My kitchen has only cheese as an animal product right now.  99% of the time I see no need for meat and honestly I cant afford it anyway!  Also helps that I hate touching raw meat so typically cooking it is out of the question. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090506 21:58:52 nbsp Wow, it is nice knowing another transfer student.  I tried to get into Primero but they never opened up the waiting list.  Student Housing had no clue what they were doing providing transfers housing this year so I ditched them and got my own apartment.  It was amazing how little they knew about the program after their website was updated advertising it.  I might try to take advantage of the transfer student programs.  Certainly wouldnt hurt.  Interestingly several students in my Physics III class are prior military (worked the technical side of things).  However I tend to not associate with prior military since most at Butte are Army or Marines and were infantry  Ive nothing in common.  Im very much looking forward to living in Davis!

20090824 11:45:49 nbsp Are you sure about the Chase ATMs? The ATM locator on their website doesnt list them, but maybe thats because theyre new? Users/jsogul
  I saw and used a Chase ATM at the East Covell CVS, but I havent seen the one at the West Covell CVS. Maybe I just havent looked hard enough? Users/jsogul

20100525 21:16:34 nbsp Hey Max, thanks for all the great edits today. Users/TomGarberson

20100725 22:10:11 nbsp Hi Max, Im inclined to remove the Frys coupon, since they arent a local chain and arent even the closest electronics store. IMO the coupon page would be best reserved for stores that are actually in or near Davis. But perhaps this is worth discussing.  Users/DonShor

20100901 23:08:43 nbsp So is that section of the California Civil Code (on the CC min purchase page) now null? Users/EdWins

20100917 16:32:20 nbsp Howdy! I noticed that you had added to the Target page with a note about the use of carbon monoxide in relation to meat. I wasnt able to find any information that said that CO is injected into the meat, although wikipedia says that meat is sometimes packaged in an environment that contains CO. I updated the page to reflect that, but if theres some other source that says differently its definitely open to discussion. Users/JoePomidor

20101009 17:25:56 nbsp Max is the power editor today! Users/JabberWokky

20101106 17:52:42 nbsp Hmm, that does sound pretty straightforward.  Were going to be traveling overseas in about a month, so itll probably wait until after that, but sounds worthwhile. Users/TomGarberson

20101107 07:19:58 nbsp Thanks Max!  I think I had only used the Coin Master at Safeway before, didnt realize I could get the gift certificates at an actual CoinStar without a fee.  Gotta love Amazon credit! Users/TomGarberson

20101108 21:02:18 nbsp Max, thanks for the updates on the flu clinic stuff.  Its extremely valuable information.  It might be worth adding to the Events Board, too. Users/TomGarberson

20101120 17:44:25 nbsp Ive actually never heard the myth that Mennonites dont use electricity.  I had a vague (mistaken) idea that that was what distinguished them from Amish, but didnt find out the details until I lived in Pennsylvania for awhile and learned how varied the Anabaptists are.  Neat and useful anecdote  I think you really should place it into the main entry so people can read it. Users/JabberWokky

20101120 19:39:41 nbsp Its actually a myth that Amish do not use electricity.  They just dont use it casually and they really dont depend on outside power lines (each community is aggressively selfsufficient).  As an example, cell phones for business and medical help are quite common (and no, I have no idea how cell towers jibes with being selfsufficient).  Its not a matter of how advanced the technology is, it is in how it impacts your life and the community.  Modern hospitals, full of all advanced techniques are perfectly fine to use (and the whole community pays the bills of any individual member).  Penn State has a decent number of students and townies who are from Amish families, and when I lived there I had more than a few late night back porch discussions about the various groups.  I have quite a bit of respect for their choices and history.  The historical relationship theyve have with the federal government is really interesting (they really dont like to support war in any way, and refuse to pay into Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, preferring to take care of their own).  Neat culture, and a really fantastic example of a successful nontraditional culture living by their own beliefs within the United States. Users/JabberWokky

20110305 20:24:48 nbsp Thank you for the accurate information on videos.  Sometime people dont speak very accurately. Users/BruceHansen

20110323 10:44:47 nbsp Thanks for the links Max!  Im new at this. :) Users/TravisLindquist

20110424 23:45:39 nbsp How many flavors do they have? If they have only three, then for each soda, you can have eight different combinations, ranging from no flavor added to all the flavors added.  Users/hankim

20110424 23:53:34 nbsp Never mind. Read the edit you left on the main 711 page. Users/hankim

20110520 01:38:24 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/49er_Video?actiondiff&at_date1305876916.23528 Thanks for the tense fixing! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20110603 08:11:20 nbsp Your doughnuts make me gough nuts! Users/TomGarberson

20110722 19:33:30 nbsp Ive admired your posts for a long time, Max. Thanks for speaking your mind on the Borders page. My way of writing pushes buttons, but I appreciate your point of view. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110726 23:10:06 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Ban_Plastic_Bags?actiondiff&version213&version112 Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I just never could bring myself to summarize all of that.  No doubt others will weigh in now that youve set the stage.  Again, thanks. Users/CovertProfessor

20110821 19:16:19 nbsp Did Safeway switch over to Coinstar instead of their lame knockoff? Users/TomGarberson

20111113 18:00:41 nbsp they uuh, still cater uuh so technically you can uuh still get uuh stone burgers Users/StevenDaubert

20111207 17:10:25 nbsp I dont think they can actually do that.  Im pretty sure civil limitations can only be done in legislature (District Attorneys, for instance, are often protected from being sued for prosecuting people), but contracts that limit the ability to seek damages  while they are used  dont seem to be enforceable in practice.  Im not questioning the edit: its well worth noting that they are trying to.  Im just curious as to why they would try to pull that. Users/JabberWokky

20111207 23:32:11 nbsp Okay, but...  Say, Clear Channel got sued repeatedly for radio contests despite their lawyers writing contracts that were signed by the contestants prior to participating.  The same happens fairly often with other large companies and waivers.  Users/JabberWokky
