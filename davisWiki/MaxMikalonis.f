20080213 13:53:13 nbsp Hi! Im one of the people who had applied for SSFAAC and I was wondering if there is anything to do to follow up my application (interview, etc.) or if I should just wait for a decision. Thanks! Users/ChristineLim

20080218 23:07:54 nbsp The April jump was due to switching from the from just being Davis Wiki to becoming Wiki Spot hosting Davis Wiki. The page count was off before the switch and corrected during the transition.  Some stats to date are still off... the individual User Statistics are lower than they actually should be, but correcting those are pretty much just a vanity issue and is pretty low priority considering that the correction means a heavy database run. Users/JabberWokky

20080424 11:15:31 nbsp Thanks for deleting the duplicate.  My first time adding an image and had a little trouble. Users/EmilyH

20080602 18:46:41 nbsp You get shouts for pointing out bundling, Thanks Users/StevenDaubert

20080616 20:42:07 nbsp Thanks for the clarification Max.  Hows summer treating you? Users/EliYani

20080814 02:02:20 nbsp Yeah, well, DCD is definitely a social structure, and the more daviswiki advertising it gets the better, right? Anyway, good to know youre working with SFBO on stuff. Apparently, Ill be doing some work Friday night manning the Yolo United booth at the Yolo County fair, so sayith Don. Let me know if you need my help with something. Speaking of Yolo United, there ought to be a Daviswiki page for them... Perhaps Ill create one. Users/brandonhkey

20090124 19:20:49 nbsp Thanks for clearing that up. As someone who never really cared about ASUCD politics, it was always just wordplay to me.  Users/EdWins

Max  I saw your revert on the silly Infernal Affairs Commission page.  Im a bit confused by your revert. I wrote that letter, not Steven Ostrowski. And you did vote on the bill. Did I do something to offend you? Let me know so that we can come to some compromise on the page. Take care. Cameron

20091014 21:47:03 nbsp max you have to be kidding he took an unbiased page and made it all about know on p, the arguments and debate are on the wildhorse ranch page Users/DUrhausen

20091027 17:40:05 nbsp If you leave an edit comment when you delete a page you can avoid follow up questions. Why was Osahon Ekhator deleted? Users/JasonAller

20091109 12:05:35 nbsp Good compromise, I made the NotLEAD label knowing it would be changed eventually.  JAM has to be treated like a slate since they have stated Vote #13. Users/GregWebb

20091109 13:40:47 nbsp Of course the election codes need revision.  Theyre the only part of ASUCD bylaws that are highstakes and highuse.  You werent even in Davis when I wrote my first bill  8 pages of elections reform.  Im still convinced that I allowed TGIF to happen, since I wrote the bill to make the initiative process comprehensible by man.  But yeah, if you can, take a look at the 2004 codes.  Awful. Users/BrentLaabs

20100111 13:10:38 nbsp Thanks for the citation.  Have a slice of cake! Users/JabberWokky

20100806 11:38:46 nbsp Probably.  Just giving the benefit of the doubt.  Also known as enough rope. Users/JabberWokky

20120130 18:42:01 nbsp Max  This is in response to your comment on the Clubside Apartments page about archiving old comments. See my comment from a few minutes ago. I believe that It would be appropriate to archive older comments about the Clubside specifically because of the apparently dramatic changes for the better that have taken place.  Users/MarkRowan
