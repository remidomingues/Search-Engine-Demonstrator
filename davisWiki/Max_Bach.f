20130702 13:24:20 nbsp I worked for Max at the Crepe Bistro in the 90s, and he was a great guy.  One of the benefits he provided for his employees was free food, which was a huge plus for low wage job.  He also had a philosophy for was Bistro menu that is rare these days, basically affordable food made from good, high quaility ingredients.  I learned to cook at the Crepe Bistro, and much of my own philosophy about the culinary arts comes from Maxs approach to food.  He is missed, but Im sure still present in the hearts and crepe skillets of many locals. Users/jefftolentino
