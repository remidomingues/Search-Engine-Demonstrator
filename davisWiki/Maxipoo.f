a.k.a. Maxipoo

I am 5 years old. I am currently employed as a relaxation technician. It pays well enough for me to hire a Users/DagonJones family to take care of me and feed me while I am doing my research. I am currently working on a new method of sleep and relaxation. I have found that I can conserve vast amounts of calories by sleeping most of the day. I try to avoid as much movement as possible. this job has been a dream come true.

I enjoy sleeping, relaxing, meditation, eating, stretching, eating, napping, and especially eating.
