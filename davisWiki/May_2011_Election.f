The May 2011 Election had only one item on the ballot:  Measure A, which asks, Recognizing cuts in state funding, shall the Davis Joint Unified School District be authorized to levy an emergency special tax for a period of two years not to exceed the annual rate of $20.00 per dwelling unit for multidwelling parcels and $200.00 per parcel for all other parcels, to fund essential school programs including core subjects, elective classes, reduced class sizes, counselors and school site safety?

This was Davis first MailOnly Elections mailonly election.  The ballots were to be mailed to local voters on April 4 and are due back by 8 p.m., May 3.  The measure required 2/3 approval in order to pass.

Bob Dunning had http://www.davisenterprise.com/opinion/dunning/besuretovotebutdontwastetimelookingforpollingplaces/ predicted on an uncluttered ballot with only one choice to be made, Measure A will carry the day with 70.2 percent of the vote … but don’t bet the mortgage on it

Columnist Rich Rifkin had predicted a 67.2% margin.
