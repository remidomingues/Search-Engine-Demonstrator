The May Warren Alcove is inside the Davis Branch Library and houses hard and softcover books, magazines and occasionally other materials for sale.  The proceeds from book sales go towards the Friends of the Davis Public Library. Patrons pay for items by putting payment in the locked Honor Box. The prices are excellent and the stock is rotated frequently.  They also keep a crate of free publications next to the alcove.

When you enter the library itself, go through the metal detector, turn right, and then turn right again, voila!
