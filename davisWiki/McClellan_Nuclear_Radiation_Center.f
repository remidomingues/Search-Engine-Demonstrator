Operated by UC Davis, the McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center does neutron radiography (including computed tomagraphy) and neutron irradiation, produces I125, and performs neutron research. Neutron radiography (imaging) is used for defect detection in highreliability parts, such as used in aerospace and nuclear industries. Because neutrons are large neutral particles, they have very different absorption properties visavis electromagnetic radiation (Xray/gamma rays).
