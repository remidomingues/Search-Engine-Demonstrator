McConeghy Ranch is a 300 acre piece of land located at the Kidwell exit on Interstate 80.  In 2005 it became the first open space purchased through the use of the funds authorized by the passing of the 2000 November 2000 Election/Measure O Measure O.  The Davis City of Davis, http://www.consrv.ca.gov/index/ California Department of Conservation (DOC), http://www.nrcs.usda.gov Natural Resource Conservation Service, Dixon, and UC Davis purchased the land.

It lay outside either Davis or Dixons sphere of influence, but is now an easement held by the Solano Land Trust and both cities.
