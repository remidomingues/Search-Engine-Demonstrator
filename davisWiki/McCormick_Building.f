Image(fstreet.jpg, The McCormick Building, photographed in November 05, 320, thumbnail)Image(lofts4rent.jpg, You too can Live in the Loft of Luxury... for a price!, 180, right, thumbnail)The McCormick Building, located at Address(707 4th Street) at the intersection of 4th Street and F Street, is a 30,000 sq. ft. mixeduse structure featuring retail space on the ground floor, the offices of Larry Walker Associates (an environmental engineering and consulting firm) on the second floor, and loftstyle apartments on the third floor.  It was developed by Chuck Roe, president of Pyramid Construction, who also developed The Lofts  a functionally similar project at 109 E Street.  It was designed by local architect Robert Lindley of YHLA Architects and completed in 2003 by Steve Harrison of Harrison Construction.

There are a total of 8 residential units on the third floor  approximately 1200 square feet apiece.  The residential portion of the building is managed by Woodmont Real Estate Services of Sacramento.  As of March 2008, there were (still) two units available with a rental price of $1925/month for a 12month lease and $1950/month for a shorter lease.  The latest rental prices may be found on http://www.woodmontrentals.com/ Woodmonts rental site, but at ~$1.60 per square foot, this address may possibly be the most expensive place to live in Davis.
