20080917 20:59:30 nbsp The Capay Valley Wildflower honey (the darkest one I believe) is made from all the different plants in bloom during the season, is thick and has a very distinct taste. It has an almost medicinal sweetness/flavor (Maybe because darker honeys are supposed to have more antioxidants/vitamins?). For those looking for a milder flavor try their lighter colored honeys.
