20081130 20:52:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please read that Welcome to the Wiki link and Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Deleting pages isnt how things are done around here. The Wiki Community prefers discussion over destruction. Users/JasonAller

20081130 20:58:33 nbsp If there is something in particular that is wrong with the InNOut pages, please discuss it with the Wiki community.  For example, if you click on {{{InNOut/Talk}}}, you can create a page for discussion about the InNOut pages.   Users/CovertProfessor

20081130 21:21:14 nbsp Are you aware that the version of the phone number that you keep changing is not just listed on this website? It is also on: http://www.daviscalifornia.com/RESTAURANTS.htm and http://www.indavis.com/directoryf.asp?dir12&nameFood&start60 among others. Is it fair to the person who has the number youve changed it to? Users/JasonAller

20081130 21:26:26 nbsp It may also be helpful to know that the wiki has dealt with a similar issue regarding Ben & Jerrys; talking about why you want to make the change is really smart, otherwise people will only see your edits and react to them as damage and try to repair the page. If you explain yourself and an agreement is reached then that wont happen. Users/JasonAller

20081130 21:28:58 nbsp Im not sure why you are changing the phone number, or why someone would even want to keep their business phone number a secret at a place like that, but as a customer I find it very useful to call ahead and see if a place will still be open sometimes.  Theyd get less business from me at those times if I couldnt call ahead.  Why would you want to put someone elses number on there? Users/IDoNotExist

20081130 21:42:41 nbsp I was contacted by a representative from InNOut corporate in October 2006 about removing the local phone number from the InNOut page. In order to respect the wishes of some that the number not have greater attention brought to it, I privately asked a few other dwiki users for their opinion on the matter. I also posed the question in very general terms on wiki ethics some discussion page and Users/GrumpyOldGeek posted some feedback there. The consensus I got at the time was that since the information was not harmful and was actually useful, it should remain. Indeed, the reason the phone number was posted to begin with is because the user who posted it needed it (long story).

The users of DavisWiki (albeit just some of them, quietly, and informally) decided that the number should stay. InNOut corporate apparently decided it wasnt worth their time to pursue the matter, so they left it alone. I recommend that you do likewise. I can tell you that it is unlikely to be removed and further discussion of this matter will just make the number more visible (c.f: wiki:wikipedia:Streisand effect). If you want to bring this issue to the wiki public, though, thats your right. Users/WilliamLewis
