Meadow Ridge Apartments is located in South Davis near the intersection of Cowell Boulevard and Mace Boulevard.  It may be out in East Davis, but it has quick access to I80 and a lots of covered parking, making it great for those with automobiles.  Despite the name, there is neither a meadow nor a ridge on the property, however it IS a very catchy name.  Meadow Ridge is located near the El Macero Shopping Center, making it a great neighbor to borrow  err buy  a cup of sugar from.  Or whatever else they have there. Meadow Ridge is pet friendly for animals up to 50 lbs with an additional pet deposit and monthly pet rent of $15 per pet.

They offer a variety of lease options from monthtomonth up to 15 months, and do not do the August turnover.  Vacancy information is available 30 days prior to known availability, due to legislation that requires 30 days of notice of intent to vacate an apartment.

20111007 15:03:27 nbsp Dont bother cleaning your apartment, or trusting anything Kelly says. We recently moved out and during the walk through she told me that it was just about the cleanest apartment she had ever seen. I was warned that we would be charged for a touch up paint, as they needed to do that for every apartment. Upon receiving the bill we had been charged $300. And one of the charges referenced heavy cleaning. Every interaction with the front office since Gerry left has been an annoyance. I used to agree that the owner was nice, too bad it changed.

20120612 16:22:18 nbsp Lived here for two years before moving to the Bay.  Good maintenance and quiet place to call home, also close to the Nugget grocery store and a really good Chinese restaurant (Wok of Flame).  Its also extremely close to I80 (but not so close that you are overwhelmed with freeway noise). The biggest negative is that its a long way from downtown Davis.     Users/JaredWilson

20130725 15:17:26 nbsp We just moved in a week ago and we couldnt be happier.  The apartments have a washer and dryer in the unit, are pet friendly and even have wood burning fireplaces!  Kristen has been great to work with and got us into the apartment we wanted.  It has all the benefits of living in Davis and an easy commute to West Sac.  Highly recommend this place!
