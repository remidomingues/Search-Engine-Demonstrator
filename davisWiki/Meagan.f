I am transferring to Davis in Fall as an Animal Science Major. i will be moving from the Bay Area and my pets, Shaka and Sassy, will be coming with me. I am also thinking about joining Club Waterpolo.





Welcome to the Wiki! Sassy looks seriously mellow in that photo. :)  You might try making thumbnails and captions of wiki:wikispot:Help with Images those photos: just use {{{Image(Shaka in snow 018.jpg, thumbnail, 300, My doggie Shaka, he is getting old but still has loads of energy when needed)}}}.  Check out wiki:wikispot:Help with Images for more tips. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
