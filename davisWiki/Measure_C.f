Measure C is a local ballot measure, the only one on the ballot in the March 2012 Election.  The text of the measure reads, Shall the Davis Joint Unified School District continue a local parcel tax to preserve existing classroom programs including math, science, English, and music; key schoolbased personnel including librarians, nurses, counselors, school technology and reading specialists; and other programs such as athletics, drama, student nutrition and class size reduction for a period of 5 years not to exceed the Base Annual Tax of $150.00 per unit for multidwelling parcels and $320.00 per parcel for all other parcels?
