Davis Open Space Protection Tax
This measure was on the November 7, 2000 ballot and passed with 70.4% Yes, 29.5% No. It needed 66.6% to pass.

Measure O increased property taxes by $24/year, which goes to fund open space acquisition and management. It is expected to generate $17.5 million over 30 years.

The first use of these funds was in December 7, 2005, when the Davis City of Davis, http://www.consrv.ca.gov/index/ California Department of Conservation (DOC), http://www.nrcs.usda.gov Natural Resource Conservation Service, Dixon, and UC Davis purchased the 300acre McConeghy Ranch located at the Kidwell exit on Interstate 80. More information about this purchase can be found at the http://www.consrv.ca.gov/index/news/2005%20News%20Releases/NR200526_McConeghy_Ranch_Easement.htm DOC.

In June 2006, a similar measure, June 2006 Primary Election/Measure G Measure G, passed by nearly the same percentage.
