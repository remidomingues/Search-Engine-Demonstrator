Measure P was put on the 2004 City Council Election ballot and passed with 68.5% of the vote, barely the necessary amount to pass.  Measure P was a sales tax increase of .5 percent. Had Measure P not passed it was predicted by the city that there would be a 2 million dollar budget shortfall for the 20042005 year.  Every precinct in the City of Davis approved of Measure P.


<There is a county Measure P on the ballot right now that is a library parcel tax for November 2007, I think we need to be careful not to confuse people since that is what people are going to hear about for the next five months. Users/DavidGreenwald>
