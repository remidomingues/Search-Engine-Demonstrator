The campus Meat Lab sells a variety of high quality meats for fantastic prices. If youre planning on having a BBQ, or just need some meat, the Meat Lab is far superior to any other Butchers meat vendor in Davis, in terms of both quality and Living Cheaply price. Unless youre looking for some specialty meat or fish in which case I would recommend the Nugget.

Most of the meat comes from Cows university livestock which is slaughtered on Campus campus. However, the demand for some beef products is so high that some of it is imported.  The beef is all natural, grain fed and the pork is not injected with hormones.  If you ever want specifics, you can ask the meat lab manager who can tell you everything you want to know.

The Meat Labs prices change every so often and are available on the bottom of the http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/facilities/meat.htm Meat Labs website.

Their Chips and Beer sausage is delicious.  They have a variety of sausages that rotate from time to time.  They also have flats of 30 chicken eggs (and occasionally quail eggs) for $4.

They rarely have everything on their list at all times, so its best to call ahead to check if you are looking for a specific cut.   During the winter, they seldom have a call for lamb and dont carry it.


Directions

From 113, Exit Hutchison and head East.  Turn right (South) on to La Rue Road.  After the road curves, look for Putah Creek Road and turn right.  Turn left at the yellow sign that says Meat Science Laboratory.  At the end of the white fence, turn left onto the gravel parking area and head for the Northeast corner.  There is very limited parking available.


Other Uses

Beyond the direct classes in handling meat taught in the meat lab itself, samples taken during processing and entire processed carcasses are used by many different projects across campus.  Fields that use samples from the Meat Lab include Animal Science, Food Science, Reproductive Physiology, Endocrinology, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, Veterinary Medicine, Entomology, and Microbiology.  As an example, cattle blood collected during processing is used elsewhere on campus to feed mosquitoes used in research.

20080718 22:09:43 nbsp With the price of eggs going up at the grocery store, paying $2.50 for 25 is a great deal.  Tip: Bring 2 old 12egg cartons, if you are biking home. The paper crates they provide are really flimsy.(The shells on some of the eggs are really thin.) Users/AmyTrinh

20100527 16:49:28 nbsp No comments in a while so I thought Id say that this place rocks. Just about everything here is awesome, but if you are looking for some real carne asada, you have to go to El Torito Meat Market in Woodland. Users/GarrettGallegos

20101028 01:58:16 nbsp I dont know if its just me but the price of the steaks, rib eye @ 10 dollars lb and porterhouse/filet mignon ,at USDA CHOICE quality is over priced. But there are a few exceptions, maybe I visited during a mediocre batch of steaks, but if by chance you find a USDA PRIME steak then its worth it. I suggest going on Thursday afternoon cause thats when they get new stock. I did once find a USDA prime rib eye at 10$ a lb and that was definitely worth it, other times Im just going through a pile of meat looking for anything near USDA PRIME. If you cant find USDA prime, then a nearby supermarket serving USDA CHOICE would most likely be cheaper.  Users/MatthewYu
