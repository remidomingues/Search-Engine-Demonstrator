A meat market is where people go to shop for meat. By shop for I mean check out. By meat I mean other people.  If youre smooth, you might get lucky and get some ass at these places. (And by ass, we mean sex.)

Davis Meat Markets include:

   The Rec Pool, or any other Swimming pool (to a lesser extent)
   The ARC
   DJ Dance nights at The Graduate underaged veal, Ketmoree kobe beef, and  Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y. ghetto sausage.

This is not to be confused with the Davis Farmers Market, where people sometimes sell meat, the Meat Lab or the El Torito Meat Market in Woodland. Of historical interest there used to be a real Davis Meat Market.


When the sun is shining and its not below 7075 degrees, the Arlington Farms pool has one of the most extensive selections of meat available. Theres Greek Meat, Abercrombie Meat, Hurley Meat, Ground Beef, Meat Reduced for Quick Sale, and decidedly nonlean meat.    Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn
