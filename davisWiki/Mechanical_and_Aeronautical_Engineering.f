http://mae.engr.ucdavis.edu/ Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering, administered from 2132 Bainer Hall, offers two Bachelor of Science degrees: one in mechanical engineering, the other in aeronautical engineering. They also offer plans for double majoring in mechanical/aeronautical engineering and mechanical/materials science engineering. They also offer a plan to earn a Masters Degree in mechanical engineering in five years (including undergraduate education).

For the uninitiated, Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering is involved in projects such as FutureTruck, Formula SAE, Aerobrick, and Human Powered Vehicle competitions; its facilities include several very cool wind tunnels, a manufacturing laboratory, a hybrid electric vehicle laboratory, a sports biomechanics laboratory, a hydrogen production and utilization laboratory, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and biosensor laboratories, and the Advanced Highway Maintenance Construction Technology (AHMCT) Center. Students and researchers within this department develop some really great technology such as robotics, sensors that can differentiate between weeds and landscape plants, vehicles with enough torque to crack the driveshaft of a heavy duty suv, and more!

MAE pulls in a lot of research funding for the university, much of it governmental, but also a significant amount from private donors such as automobile manufacturers. In fact, the department boasts annual research expenditures in excess of $6 million. Current and former sponsors include NSF, NASA, US Department of Energy, California Department of Transportation, EPA, NIH, Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motors Inc, Mori Seiki, California Energy Commission, Office of Naval Research, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The mechanical engineer uses basic science in the design and manufacture of complex engineering systems, requiring the application of physical and mechanical principles to the development of machines, energy conversion systems, materials, and equipment for guidance and control. Work in this broad field of engineering requires a thorough knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer, electricity, manufacturing processes and economics. The Mechanical Engineering curriculum is based on a common core of engineering courses taken in the first two years. The third year is spent in further study of the fundamental courses, and in the fourth year in tailoring your studies to your own interests by selecting courses in controls and systems analysis, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mechanical design or thermodynamics. You can either prepare for graduate study in Mechanical Engineering or obtain a broad background for entering engineering practice at the bachelors level.

 Majors 
Mechanical Engineering: Mechanical engineers use basic science in the design and manufacture of complex engineering systems. They apply physical and mechanical principles to the development of machines, energy conversion systems, materials, and equipment for guidance and control.

Aeronautical Engineering: Aeronautical engineers apply scientific knowledge to the design, manufacture and operation of bodies and vehicles influenced by aerodynamic forces.

Mechanical Engineering/Aeronautical Science & Engineering: A double major. Requirements for both majors must be met.

Mechanical Engineering/Materials Science Engineering: A combined or dual major directed toward an understanding of the structure, properties, and behavior of materials.
