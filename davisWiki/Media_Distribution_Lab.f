 Hart Media Lab Hart 1101 stopped distributing media in Spring 2010. All checkout videos/audio can be found at the Shields Reserves desk or online at http://streamer.ucdavis.edu/.
 The rest of this page may be out of date and mostly refers to the Hart Media Lab 



The Media Distribution Lab is a Computer Labs computer lab that can be found in 1101 Hart Hall.  If a professor uses a video in a class, he or she can leave it on reserve here, where you can watch it.  However, if youre planning to do any real media work, you should probably head over to the Meyer Media Lab. Any student can check out videos (to watch in the lab); while the lab has your standard mundane class videos, it also is bound to have something to watch if you have nothing else to do. The http://video.ucdavis.edu listing has videos ranging from Rambo to South Park to The Safe Use of Hydroflouric Acid.

The Hart Media Distribution Lab has:

  8 quick access stations (10 minute use if no line): 4 PC, 4 Mac
  12 sitdown stations: 8 PC, 4 Mac
  27 TVs (including 2 and 4 person viewing stations)
  10 Mac Media stations to be used for viewing digital media (restricted to .edu websites; no word processors installed)
  Empty tables with outlet extension to be used by laptop users who wish to use Wireless Printing.
  25 Mac Pros in the 1102 computer classroom, though its often reserved throughout the day (check the schedule beforehand at the http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/available/ website), but has many design programs, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, and Vectorworks. The classroom also has 5 scanners and a color printer ($1.50 per side)
  An annex  which has a quick access scanner (10 minute use) for when the classroom is reserved (ask onshift CRC for permission to use)
