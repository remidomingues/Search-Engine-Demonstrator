Not positive that this page doesnt exist elsewhere in some other form.  But it would be nice to have a list here of references to the wiki by the media.  Possibly, something like Phil Neustroms quote in the NY Times today might go here too, although that isnt wiki related or Davis related, so Im not positive that this would be the right place for it.
    Added to Philip Neustrom, as thats his public entry.  jw


see Wiki History, maybe you can break that section out into this page and then use the include macro to reinclude it on that page?
