20090313 15:05:24 nbsp Ive had a lot of massage for chronic pain, and many therapists hurt me and made me feel much worse later. Vickies massages have helped me through injuries that MDs were ready to give up on. Shes the only massage therapist I see anymore, and the only one Id readily recommend to friends. Users/GreenThing
