20090202 15:37:30 nbsp Kira has always been awesome with my optometry very helpful with my random eye related questions Users/StevenDaubert

20091008 18:01:53 nbsp Got great contact lenses and glasses from Dr. Wagner.  These guys dont try to sell you pictures of the back of your eye and gave me starter contact lens solutions.  Having a eye doctor and optometrist in one place is good  they solved my eye problems together. Users/GHHom

  This comment is a Sockpuppets sockpuppet created by Dr. David Kira in an attempt to boost his own business, and very unethical behavior for a doctor.  It came from IP 71.140.28.22 which is the same IP that Dr. Kira used to make edits (as dtkira) 5 minutes before he made this fake review. Users/FraudAlert

 Actually  this was a patient using our open WiFi in our waiting room.  We added this capability just recently for our patients to be able to surf the web and be productive while dilating.  We use the same computer in the dilating room  hence the same IP address.  Patients are free to make comments as they wish. This patient actually found us through Davis Wiki (checked chart)  needed to see an optometrist (for glasses) and an ophthalmologist (for associated medical problem)  asked to place review.  David Kira

  So, what youre saying is that you just recently added WiFi (just recently meaning before October 8th, 2009) and on this particular Thursday during which you spent your entire lunch hour making changes to this page, you also decided to make another change just before 6pm and there happened to be a patient in your waiting room, despite the fact that your office closes at 5pm, and this particular patient coincidentally happened to leisurely write a review from his laptop computer that he brought with him to his afterhours eye exam not 5 minutes later, which you later edited yourself?  Is that really what youre saying?  By the way, dont sign with my signature. Users/FraudAlert

20100212 10:40:15 nbsp Dr.Kira and Wagner are quite professional and friendly. I cant say the same thing for In house optical lab. They were not friendly to me and even they didnt give the necessary explanation for the bill and my insurance claims. When I get my frames, I saw that the lenses were not placed correctly into frames (It took 10 days to process my order), I had to fix them by myself. I used the frames that I purchased from someplace else, they charged my insurance $15 without telling me. I am so sorry to have worked with them.  Users/Stan34

20100706 16:32:25 nbsp This phone number does not work! Does anyone know the new one? Users/SexyPianist89
    I just called the number, and a receptionist for Medical Vision Technology answered.  Seems fine to me.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20100722 04:04:32 nbsp This has been where Ive gone for eye care as long as I can remember... meaning wherever I went before junior high or so was less than memorable. Ive always felt welcomed and well caredfor and see absolutely no reason that any member of the staff would feel the need to place a false review here. Their service speaks for itself.
I not only leave the office feeling confident in my eye health, but feeling EDUCATED about it. Even when, up until last week, Id left with nothing but compliments on my sight. Last week I left with a prescription for my newly nearsighted right eye... Or it was news to me, anyway. Imagine my shock going from 20/20 to ...I cant read that at all. Of course, I hadnt been in for 3 years seeing no issue with my sight. I learned my lesson.
I was doomed, I suppose. My whole family wears glasses.
Regardless, I was pleased with the assessment and now am aware that I see better if I close my lame eye. Psh. Ill be shopping for spectacles tomorrow. Thank you, doctors and staff, and I will be back next July!

20100724 18:40:38 nbsp Saw Dr. Kira this Saturday  we were referred to him as an oncall provider from my daughters pediatric group. My 3 year old daughter had (what turned out to be) a bug stuck in her eye. Dr. Kira was really kind and gentle with her, took the time to explain to her everything he was doing, and had it out in just a few minutes. Thank you! Users/DanielBoxwell

20101022 01:58:24 nbsp Dr. Wagner was super nice and attentive when he did my eye exam. However, their contact lens prices are a lot higher than other places. I got mine for $40/box, I called several other places and it was $35/box. That said, Id go here for my eye exam but I will never buy contact lenses here again!! Users/thtly

20110503 13:16:13 nbsp I have had glasses for 25 years and contacts for cumulatively 10+ years, and never have I had so much trouble getting my prescription correct.  I was fine with Dr Kira, as he handled my glasses last year, but Dr Wagner handles all things contactsrelated.  So this year, I was newly fitted for contacts, and when I got my first trial pair, the contact for my right eye was VERY wrong.  I went back and got another trial, which was less wrong but I still couldnt read properly, so I have since taken my business elsewhere, as I no longer trust them with my eye care. Users/deeray82

20120105 21:16:35 nbsp I have also had trouble getting the right prescription.  The whole experience also felt rushed.  Im not planning on going back. Users/DaveG

20131014 17:21:07 nbsp I went in to see Dr. Kira a couple of months ago. It was my first pair of glasses, and I was told that if the prescription didnt seem right once I got my glasses, I could go back in and have my vision reassessed free of charge.

My initial experience with Dr. Kira was just okay. It was my first pair of glasses, and I didnt really know the right types of questions to ask. It felt rushed, and I walked out with a diagnosis I didnt really understand and a new prescription.

When I did finally get my glasses (through LensCrafters, not Dr. Kira), the lenses were the correct prescription that Dr. Kira had written for me, its just that the prescription that Dr. Kira had written for me was incorrect. So, I called and scheduled another appointment. The staff was amazing, really prompt and helpful and did their best to get me in as soon as possible.

When I went in, I was again informed by Dr. Kira that this visit would be free of charge. One of his techs also told me that Dr. Kira had left a note in my file saying that I would most likely be back, because its pretty common for firsttimers to need a second exam.

The second experience at Dr. Kiras was not unlike the first. Rushed, but I wasnt about to complain, because they were seeing me for free. At least, I THOUGHT they were seeing me for free, because I was told that multiple times. When I got the bill, however, I found that they had decided to charge me $95, due to the length of the visit, but then reduced it to $35 after I called the billing office in Sacramento. Im not complaining about the charge itself, really, because I was provided a service. But, I am uninsured, and I should have been informed of the charge BEFORE I went in. Its just in poor taste to tell me that my visit will be free of charge, but then have a change of heart and charge me nearly $100 for it. Had I known, I wouldnt have gone back in. I could have gone to an optometrist for half the price. Im just really disappointed, because despite the rushed visits, Dr. Kira seemed like a really nice guy and I really loved his staff.

20140402 16:22:14 nbsp This office is in total disarray. They couldnt figure out my insurance information and were not able to order my contact lenses. I had to go elsewhere to get my prescription filled. This office has gone downhill significantly since Dr. Wagner has left. Time to find a new eye doctor. Users/RonBerry
