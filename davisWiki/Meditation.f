Yoga may include meditation. Tai Chi is a type of meditation in motion.  In Buddhism, meditation is the central practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. In popular culture, meditation is typically portrayed as a stilling of the mind while seated on the ground, but the reality is that you can have this type of mindfulness while doing anything.
