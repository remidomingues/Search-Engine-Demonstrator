Native to areas around the Mediterranean Basin, including Southern Europe and Northern Africa, the Mediterranean Fan Palm is one of the toughest palm species in the world. It is also the most northernly, with populations in Italy and Southern France occurring at 43Â° N, further north than Chicago and New York. Coming from a climate almost identical to Davis Weather Weather, the Mediterranean Fan Palm is extremely drought and frost tolerant and will grow without any additional water or care. They even thrive in the puke pits better known as frat house backyards.
