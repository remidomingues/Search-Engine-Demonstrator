$25,000 fundraising goal
40 days left
Philip says use the name Davis Wiki, that the money is being raised for Davis Wiki.
Relationship to the grant. The grant covers some things, but this is for outreach.
$350,000 is a mandate to go do this, but we need other resources.
Should put front page things that have been on Davis Wiki on other wikis like Santa Cruz. Philip will manage that. Also check that wiki spot donation buttons are set to forward to the fundraising.
Nick asked about RocWiki, Philip had talked to him.

Philip said remember to rename the current pledge list page.

Would donors be allowed to use that in promotional materials that they produce.

The pitch:
We are from the Davis Wiki and we are having a fundraiser. We are a 501(c)(3) organization.

There are some who have used it in negative ways, but we are working to improve things so that it can be used in a more positive manner to build and strengthen community – maybe into flyer 2?

Three pieces of information:
1. This is Davis Wiki
Facts and Philosophy
links to introductory content on the wiki “Welcome to the Wiki”
Some Q & A

2. Support Davis Wiki by donating to the Local Wiki project
What we are doing right now
New effort to support other communities
and to improve Davis Wiki
The more money we raise the better the next version of the software will be.

4. The event that your donation will be auctioned at: (combine this with #2)
