20070427 07:22:58 nbsp Nevermind  Users/JasonAller just IMed me... I was reading the typo as Midtown To PM because it was on the Night Time entry. He figured out it was supposed to be Midtown Stomp.  Ill fix the link right now.  By the way, you might also look into creating a full entry about the group on wiki:sacramento the Sacramento Wiki.  Regardless, its close enough to be of interest for Davisites too.  Users/JabberWokky
