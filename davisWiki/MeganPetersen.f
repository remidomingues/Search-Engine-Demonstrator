   Self motivated, upbeat photographer with a passion for design, skating and music.
   There are way more things that I like than dislike (especially my hat)
   My dude is like my design partner and skate motivator and
   Lady Gagas song Telephone gets me pumped up

From Olympia WA then to San Diego for the past year and a half,
and now moving to Davis cause my man Toby got into UCD (boom!)

I feel I might be a minority not being a student and all, hahaha!  But Davis seems fun,
its awesome Sacramento is right there and the bay is only an hour and a skip away.

20100804 19:39:02 nbsp Hi Megan, Welcome to the Wikiand to Davis.  Have you checked out the Public Skate Park at Community Park?  I dont skate, but it looks like a great setup. Users/TomGarberson

20100804 19:59:14 nbsp oh yea, Toby and I got the chance to check the place out last week, super close to the skate park... lol, its not a whole lot of a skate park, but it was lit at 11:30pm and empty... and only a few blocks from where well be, so its most definitely going to be enjoyed!  Thanks Tom Users/MeganPetersen

20100804 20:46:58 nbsp The big bowl is notoriously lumpy, the snake is bootsie, I broke my tooth on the east side of the fun box when I was 11, at least you can ride down the hills for speed. Go to campus skate spots depending on the skill level and go jump the vine gaps, or any one of the 7,8,9,10,11,12 stairs etc, but watch out for UCD fuzz they dislike the skating Users/StevenDaubert

20100804 21:05:32 nbsp Haha!  Thanks Steven!  That bowl is more of a dip... lol... The Binicia skatepark is where its at )  yea... the fuzz dont like our kind anywhere... but when you get the occasional policeman thats impressed, hes cool and lets you go Users/MeganPetersen

20100804 22:55:12 nbsp What is the sickest trick you two have on lock? Users/StevenDaubert

20100805 10:28:03 nbsp Tobys definitely the skater... hell back savannah anything.  check out my flickr www.flickr.com/rollinglovephotography as for me... i just cruise bowls, sometimes i might soul or makio something, but normally just cruise.

20100807 12:28:18 nbsp oh btw, Jon bones Jones had a UFC fight in Sunny San Diego and he worked the fool he fought and then when he had the mic when Joe Rogan was interviewing him he told San Diego to stay classy Users/StevenDaubert

20100808 22:44:55 nbsp Lol, what a champ!  I love San Diego, a lot.  Even have a sign that says Stay Classy San Diego with a graffiti like tag of Ron Burgundys face on it I found being used as some ad, like the vote for gore picket signs posted in peoples yards and stuff, I dont normally steal, but it was at a gas station, and I was pulling away, it seemed completely necessary to have it Users/MeganPetersen

20100828 13:27:44 nbsp HELP!  MY WALLET WAS STOLEN!  Theres a girl walking around with blonde hair, mid 20s, probably 54 or 55 wearing a black T thats says I Dont Look Angry, I Am Angry, around 150 or 160 pounds with my wallet and my drivers license is much wanted back to me!  If someone sees her please and ask for the ID and wallet, the cards are useless, cut off... PLEASE AND THANKS!  I just moved into town 2 days ago! Users/MeganPetersen

20100828 13:29:03 nbsp Ouch, that blows.  Sorry it got stolen. Users/TomGarberson

20100831 13:41:57 nbsp they caught her in under an hour.  Still gotta clean up the mess of money she spent with the credit card.  Totally chill though, lol... not the best thing to happen in the 1st 48 hours in Davis Users/MeganPetersen
