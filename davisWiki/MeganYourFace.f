Sure. I first have to bleach my hair (normally just the roots, after my previous dye has faded) to a platinum blonde. Then I section my hair into the desired patterns and apply the dye to my hair from roots to the tips and twist up each section into a tiny bun and pin it against my head. Then since my dye is vegetable based and doesnt damage the hair, I put on a shower cap and let it sit for hours, usually over night. Then when I want to rinse it I use cold water to keep the colors from bleeding. ) Users/MeganYourFace
