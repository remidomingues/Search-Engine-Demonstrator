20110822 17:03:45 nbsp Megan shot my engagement pictures in August 2010.  She was very professional and had many cool ideas for locations and specific shots.  She prepared the pictures for viewing and purchasing in a very reasonable amount of time.  She was very nice and even personally delivered the prints we bought to our house.  Users/LoriOrf

20120214 15:11:23 nbsp Megan shot our family photos.  Her pictures are nice.  Her price is reasonable and affordable.  Shes VERY disorganized.  Im going to attribute that to a booming business and she probably needs to hire help to take care of the customer service aspect.  Corresponding with her via email was a bit frustrating at times and while I tried her phone, she was always in the middle of something.  Just trying to schedule an appointment or getting answers to questions about her portrait package was hard.   Users/BingL

Thank you so much for your very honest and accurate review.  I am very happy that you enjoyed your portraits.  While I try hard to reply to correspondences in a timely matter, I do find myself overwhelmed and falling behind, especially around the busy holiday season.  I try to be upfront and apologetic with the delays, but realize that this is just not enough.  Im taking steps to become more streamlined and efficient with communications.  Unfortunately I do not recognize your user name or I would email you directly.  I would love to hear from you so I can make amends! Megan Wilkinson
