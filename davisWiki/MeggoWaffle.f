Hey all, my name is Megan and Im a grad student/TA in social science.

Davis wishlist:
 A good selection of 100% vegetarians vegetarian restaurants (at this point I would be happy with even just one)
 Extensive compost composting by the city
 Politicians who dont fall into the Republican/Democrat binary
 Drivers who know how to use their turn signals
