Culinary Anthropology is my passion Note the word Culinary. Food involves all cultures. Deaf studies due to my own personal hearing loss. I truly did not realize that there was such an issue between the hearing world and the Deaf world. As I stated I am hard of hearing. I tend to remind people often, because they tend to have a listening problem.  Most common phrase hear me say is, What?!, No seriously what did you say?  No.  Life is good, smile and enjoy the ride.
