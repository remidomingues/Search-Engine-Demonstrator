Youve used language implying that the B&J page belongs to the store with language like our scoop shop homeontheweb. Davis Wiki does not exist to give businesses in Davis free webpages. Davis Wiki is a community resource, belonging to the community, that exists to document Davis. Language like we and our is incompatible with this.

You have also made edits that are promotional in nature. Our tax exemption actually Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions prohibits this. We cannot let you make such edits without risking our tax exemption. Users/WilliamLewis

20110211 11:36:48 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  The stuff William is talking about is laid out in the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner/rep welcome page.  Its definitely worth a read. Users/TomGarberson

20110211 15:00:58 nbsp Thanks William for educating us on the use of DavisWiki. We are new to administrate the info on the page. Would it be possible to have a brief phone call to educate us more about how we can get language on the DavisWiki that is compatible with the language used on our website? It would be great if you could help us know what we cant do and we will edit to stay consistent and within guidelines. Many thanks again! Users/MelodyChong
