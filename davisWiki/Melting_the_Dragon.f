Finding the “right” healer

The beginning of ones healing process begins with your decision to embark on the journey. Ask the universe for help, ask for what you want. The next step is finding your match. What does that mean? Finding someone in whose presence you can grow. There are many capable healers and so many systems of healing... where to begin, how to discern which is right for you? Begin by making an agreement with yourself to pay attention to your intuition, to your body sensations, to your own antane... Each of us functions on different vibratory levels and it is important that we find our match. As you go through the exciting and emotional process of casting off layers, your vibration level will change and you will find your needs have changed... you may seek different helpers along the way towards the light. It is a journey of learning to trust your own intuition. We find our truth through that inner knowing, not necessarily through logic. Trust your intuition, trust your guts.... and you will find your helper.
If you found me, Hello.
