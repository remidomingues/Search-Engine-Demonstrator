Melvin Cabebe is a fourth year student at UC Davis. He is currently double majoring in International Relations and Babysitting (at least he feels he is). He is serving as one of Rienda Hall Riendas RAs for the current academic year. There is never a time when Melvin is not complaining about something. More often then not its about his homework being too hard (as is the case with Music Theory) or the residents are too quiet or too loud. Though Melvin often talks about his nostalgia for the Residence Halls dorms, he seems altogether displeased with the reality of being a Resident Advisors Resident Advisor.  Perhaps Melvin should pick his courses more wisely and not accumulate such a strenuous workload while having to manage the complaints of his freshman folk. 

Melvin also happens to be a UC Davis Tours guide where he both works at the desk and gives tours.  He complains alot there too.
