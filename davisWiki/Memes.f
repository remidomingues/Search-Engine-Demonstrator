Love it or hate it, Davis has intertwined itself in a number of Internet memes.

  John Pike
  Senator Ackerman Scandal Ackerman resigned.  how is this  a meme?  Its a LiveJournal UCDLJ thing, or at least it used to be.  Unless you show the meme, no one but insiders will know wtf you are talking about.  I certainly dont know wtf you are talking about.  UCDLJ is pretty dead and has been for some time.
