20110201 22:12:26 nbsp This guy is cool and he pays a lot of attention to detail. Id definitely recommend Memos.  Users/jsogul

20111111 11:30:03 nbsp This is a very good barber shop. They have a lot of customers on the weekends so you should go there during the week, if possible. The hair cuts are very good, with attention to detail, and the prices are fair. I am not going to change my barber as long as I stay here in Davis! Users/Tanzenderbieber

20120131 13:36:16 nbsp This is an awesome barber shop. Just had pretty much the best haircut of my life by Albert, who is a real friendly down to earth guy who, like the comment above, really has great attention to detail and the price is right.  Users/HermesHuang

20120205 19:26:48 nbsp Alberts a very chill guy and pays a lot of attention to detail like the comment above. However, Derek is pretty cocky and whenever I get my hair cut by him he screws up the fade or cuts it wayyyy too short. If you come here get it with Albert not Derek. Users/JoshRamirez

20120210 20:53:07 nbsp hahaha, NEVER come here. Dont even bother coming to this place. Theyll mess up your hair, get you mad, and expect a tip. Especially those two puerto ricans. They cut hair like 7 year olds with clippers. Users/HenryJames

20120227 14:39:06 nbsp By far the best haircuts Ive ever gotten up here in Norcalat least in Davis. But if youre a UCD student and looking for a fresh cut, go downtown and hit up Albert or Derek. Users/JoPin

20120229 21:50:22 nbsp joseph cuts hair hella good... by far the best barbers in davis. Albert has cut my hair too and he is great too.

20120302 21:51:51 nbsp this is literally the best barbershop in Davis. Perfect place to get your hair cut. Theyll stylize your hair however you want and they will do it perfectly. Every barber from the first chair to the last chair has the complete and ultimate skill set of cutting hair.   Users/meddy813

20120302 22:14:16 nbsp I would have to disagree with HenryJames. You my none friend, sound as if you have some personal issues with the members of the barbershop. Youre a disgrace for the fact that you are trying to slander Memos name through fabrications. And if they were to cut hair like 7 year olds with clippers then riddle me this, why do they consistently bring more in more costumers on a daily basis? Besides this morons opinion, memos barbershop is a great barbershop. It is a great atmosphere to be around, and every barber can cut any type of hair to your liking. Dont listen to that aclown HenryJames.  Users/jose9286

20120304 12:07:20 nbsp Great place with an awesome atmosphere! Albert is the man. Im glad I found this place my freshman year. Highly recommend coming here for your hair cut. They can pretty much do what ever you want and they spend a lot of time with each customer which is nice! Users/WyattBrown

20120308 20:03:51 nbsp Wooowwww. I cant believe some of these comments. I love memos, great atmosphere.. Im very surprised to see Joseph on here more times then Derek.. Derek is by far a much better barber and his cousin Albert is too!.. But Derek is a funny guy along with his cousin but as for the cut Derek gets down everytime. I cant see myself getting cut by anyone else especially Joseph, sorry bro but u need a lot of practice. But still Joseph does decent wen I see him cut occasionally so Im not trying to dog him everyone has theyre opinion... But anyways if your looking for the best cuts in northern California.. Foot memos and look for Derek if not then Albert. And I think theres a new barber but Im still not sure how he cuts! As for the idiot joshramirez, ur obviously a moron! Memos barbershop gets 5 out of 5 stars! If thats possible haha Users/Michaelcruz

20120312 18:14:39 nbsp This is a fantastic place to get a hair cut.  It has a fantastic atmosphere and the customer service is off the charts.  My hair has never looked better and the price is more than worth the amount of time they put in.  I definitely recommend this place to all my friends Users/ClintKastrop

20120404 10:08:06 nbsp I get my hair cut by Derek every other week. You cant get a better cut in Davis than here. Yea you gotta wait sometimes but in the end its worth it and you will be back. I GURANTEE. His cousin Albert is legit as well. If Derek is busy or isnt in the shop I go to Albert. They both cut well and once you start coming in more and they start to recognize your face you will feel right at home. Absolutely nothing negative about this place.  Users/ShadiKanaan

20121005 23:01:24 nbsp This honestly might be the best barbershop in the Sacramento area. Dont listen to these people bashing the barbers. Derick and Albert are hands down the two best barbers I have ever known. Anyone who is putting down their work does not know the first thing about real barbers, simple as that. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it, including the tip.  Users/Aram

20121110 16:47:41 nbsp Memos is probably the best barber I have ever been to.  Joseph is freaking awesome and even went out of his way to stay after hours on a weekend nonetheless to give me a killer haircut.  They pay excellent attention to detail and the crew is very friendly. Got my hair cut twice here now and probably wont ever go anywhere else!! Users/NateOffer

20130110 10:46:59 nbsp Cool shop. Lots of attention to detail. Lazy hours though lol. Theyre never open when they say they are or close a bit early. Worth waiting for though. Some of the best fades here Users/StevenTaste

20130415 14:28:50 nbsp Sad to hear that Joseph no longer cuts here.  Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, it was difficult for me to look for a new barber here in Davis.  After finally deciding to get a haircut at a barber shop instead of doing it myself almost 3 years ago, I went to Joseph and have been going to him ever since.  As a matter of fact, Joseph cuts better than a lot of the spots in the city.  The good thing is he is still cutting but only by appointment now and can be reached at (530)8677304.   Users/AlbertRodriguez

20130805 12:35:04 nbsp I do not know if this place is closed or not. I am here on a Monday at 12:30 and the door is locked, its black inside and the phone is disconnected. I hope this place isnt closed it looks like a wonderful barbershop.  Users/GideonWells

20140604 12:29:33 nbsp They shut down.  Users/mev91

20140707 17:32:13 nbsp sad to see this closed up. does anyone have alberts number?  its hard to find barbers around here Users/pbdeng
