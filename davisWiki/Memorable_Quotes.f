The goal of this page is to provide an outlet for all wiki members to write down memorable, funny, or interesting quotes that they or their friends have said. No longer will we be forced to laugh ourselves into oblivion on one doomed night of Drinking Games only to forget the astounding wit that was expressed by everyone. Has your best friend said something hilarious recently? Did you? Well, add it here.

Try to keep quotes somewhat positive. We dont want people getting offended that their Id love to shove giant  in my mouth quote went up on the Internet without their permission. But, other than that, lets quote!


 Users/StevenDaubert thinks it prudent to note that the City of Davisprovided summer camp called rainbow summer kept lists of quotes that were amended rather frequently.

Please keep the quotes in alphabetical order in the correct category.

Scientist says humans and chimpanzees are 98.5% the same. That 1.5% error is why you must now learn cubic splines and partial differential equations from me, while monkey eats banana.
     There is more to life than finite differences... theres also variationalprinciple projections, and semiiterative relaxations!
     Divide by zero, YOU GO TO HELL

   Being human is a weird property, isnt it?
   Ok. Imagine we have a dishpan  wait have I been saying dishpan? What the hell is a dishpan? I just realized I have no idea what a dishpan is. Imagine you believe in flying sauce pans.
   Ok. So if Im at the top of a ski run and I say, ‘I could have been an egg but I definitely couldnt have been a dog... this should seem intuitively to you that… this is a very weird thing to say.
   Just use black highlighter on those three pages. In case you were wondering, this is how you write philosophy books. Just take something that needs one sentence to explain and write ten pages on it. Then do it twenty times. BOOMBOOK!

   Fourths can be consonant or dissonant, depending on their context. Theyre bisexualthey swing both ways, depending on which parties they go to.
   I like the book. I have a healthy respect for the book.
   We have to naturalize the F#. Give it its green card.
   Any questions before I add another layer of hell to our already...hellish...hell?
   Cadential 64s are different. Theyre a controlled substance. Theyre like medical marijuana.
   Its like dogs. They understand a few words, but its all about tone. Are you going up?
   The book and I disagree. We should get a divorce, but...
   This is not Catholicism. There is no Pope of counterpoint rules.
   These rules are all BS.
   Its like theres a marker fairy who came in and changed all the markers.
   Thank you for making that mistake. It means we get to review it. Ill pay your five dollars after class.
   Note my use of the technical word stuff.
   We call it rounded. We should call it something else. We should call it binary with a hint of other stuff at the end.
   Heres where all hell broke loose. labels ii6 chord hell
   What does this sound like? Blank and blank. Ren and Stimpy? No.
   My metaphor for this is that theyre all walking distance from each other. This (the key of G) is UC Davis, this (key of D) is Plutos, this (key of e minor) is Armadillo Music.
   Its like when a little girl is going home. She doesnt know where Woodland is, or where Davis is, but she sees a white house and knows Were going home!
   Its like swimming in the ocean. If you stay on the circle of fifths, eventually youll get swept out to sea.
   Its like a team. If one of the notes is dull and boring, another note picks up the slack. Its just like with you guys. If one of you is having a bad day, I wont pick on you. But sometimes I do.
   Time flies when youre trying to harmonize chorales.
   What are a few octaves between friends?

Otherwise Im dead... and the Yoda dude goes you take nothing in there but what you bring with you and Im like thats really deep. Thats like life, you know. 
    I have an Ewok bear. I dont sleep with it. Ive thought about sleeping with it...
    The fuzzy ewok dudes, they worship the robot. The golden technocrat.

    I come in with my language and I pour it all over you like a gas can... its KABOOM bye bye culture!
    You dont need the apple and Eden and all to tell you whats good and bad. Its obvious. I put a blender up here, plug it in, pour a bunch of hamsters in it and turn it on... thats evil. Pretty obvious, right?
    Cloning sheep... thats just not right.
    It was like, Humbaba the Hutt in Gilgamesh!
    Ooops there I go shutting off the light again... Only gods control the light! Fiat Lux!
    There are so many great songwriters in my generation, were like the smartest greatest people to walk the face of the earth...

    On the Ramayana: Its a fun book to read to your lover or boyfriend or girlfriend... I mean... I read it to my wife, then she falls asleep within two minutes and I keep reading for half an hour, and I go... Trisha???
    Hugging is very cool. Look at that sweet look on Hanumans face. And Rama is very handsome.
    (puts mug back down) Id better not drink this. Ill get pregnant in front of everybody.
    A druid is, in its fundamental meaning, a TREEHUGGER!
    ...Dress split right up to her belt, what a sight!
    Im going deaf... Throw me away...
    It must be college  it feels like Im suffering.
    (Telling story of his friend when they were at a hamburger stand) NOW, MEAT FROM THE COW, BECOME MY THOUGHT! and took a bite  Well, thats just it... Id rather he hadnt done it at the InNOut Burger but...
    Who are we anyway? That we like this fighting? I certainly dont have the answer, but I think its an important question.
    (on Gary Snyders The Elwha River) The teacher came to me and said I just dont like you./Why?/Because I used to be a man. What the hell is that about?
    We are all eating each other. Thats how we sustain ourselves.

   Which of these is true? What is beautiful is good, or what is beautiful is me?

 Art Professor Lucy Puls
   Im not saying that those of you who work in class are elves...
   Youve got to risk ruining your pieces rather than leaving them just OK. I ruin pieces.
   Youre not in the business of making products. Youre in the business of making things that really make a difference.
    (on overornamentation in London) You go in the bathroom and you cant find the toilet because there are so many mirrors...you cant find yourself!
   Thats what life is...a series of compromises.
   Its not like you walk into a gallery and the first thing you do is throw yourself on the floor.
   Maybe Im just the queen of absurdity!
   We have the resident heroin addict...
    Shewhocorrodesalltools...
   Youre ignoring me now?! Im putting you on the beatup list.
   When you think about archivalness, that slows you down.
   Im encouraged but youre too polite.
   Would you like a mustache or sideburns with that?
   Thatll be the end of your career...when you keel over...hopefully not into the cactus outside your studio.
   I dont want you to be making my own work...I want you to struggle with the materials...
   Being disaffective is not a good way of being an artist.
   You can hate me, but I want you to be a good artist.
   Why do this if youre not gonna be a star?
   Do you want to be stabbed by my pen?
   Art has to hit your brain, but it has to hit your body too.
   When youre elderly, you make fun of things to compensate.
   Prior to the internet, youd occasionally hear about the farmer in his barn making a giant ball of string.
   Dont start miming...I hate mimes...Ill stab you.
   I gave my son Hotwheels every time he had to poop...and he has the biggest collection. I tell you, you cant even lift it.

 Theatre and Dance Theatre Professor Jon Rossini
     (as an example of surrealism): You have your brother whos really your father teaching third grade at your high school and you consider how that sixth eyebrow feels...
     Theres no real meaning to knocking over my eyedrops.
     You right handites!
     Love is a sloppy word.
     (on modern post modernism): We dont know what it is, but we know it comes after the thing that happened before.
     Is solving a problem better than leaving it open? I know thats a really lameass question, but Im just putting it out      there.
     I sometimes enjoy text as opposed to theatre better because it is safely ensconced in an ivory protected tower which is my head.
      Experimental theatre is theatre invested in the idea of theatre...whatever that is.
      A manifesto is not necessarily a thing youd want to share with your grandmother, and if you would want to, your grandmothers probably a very interesting person.
      And now Im going to ask the evil question,Why do we care?
      (Pointing to a dent): You can spend some time talking about the outline of violence against the wall.
      (On love): Its one of those fourletter words. You probably dont say it in front of your mother.
      Dont inhabit the darkness too much.
      I noticed that when I started doing tai chi outside, dogs started barking at me.
      Make theatre, not war.
      Why dont we listen to me for a moment?
      Can you be entertained by the carrots not being made for dinner?
      To explain something is to erase certain other possibilities.
      Experimental may mean that we dont yet have a context for it.
      I will not answer your question one more time.
      Nonlinear is not as weird as it could be.

 Art History Professor Simon Sadler
    The Taj Mahal tis rather beautiful...although I think the security guard stole my pen as I was going in...

    Courtesy of Google...the lovely Google...a seethrough negligée pyramid.
    I mean, the pyramids are great, but THIS...
    The courtyard...one of the greatest inventions of architecture.
    Well start class a few minutes late; Ive got to finish...finish the lecture, really...
    Its trying to kill me, this quarter...
    What a lecture to be doing with the remains of a cold...because it was kind of a pivotal moment in the history of the world... (on a lecture about Roman    architecture).
    If you go to the Pergamon Museum, which I find an absolutely hilarious place to be...
    The Romans could build up to the point of failure.
    The architectand it would have been a hedecided not to complete the triangle. Why? Because thats art.
    Can you overestimate Roman architecture? No, no, not really.
    The Romans decided the Scots werent worth it...
    My goodness, werent they convinced they were superior to everything... (on the Romans)
    This is SERIOUS overengineering, folks. (on 2,000yearold Roman aqueducts)
    Its kind of the forerunner to the modern gym. (on Roman toilets)
    For me the history of architecture is really the history of culture.
    Its getting deep and somewhat Barry White by the end of this lecture. (on his own coldaffected voice)
    I hope youre not offended...I somehow think youre not.
    All parts of the empire get the fullservice treatment from Rome.

    Were going to see why the Gothic vault whips the groin vaults ass.
    Take a chance: claustrophobia or vertigo!
    Theyre constantly wanting to fall down, these places. (on Gothic cathedrals)
    It would be a perfect place to die... (on Notre Dame)
    What the HELL is this picture of?
    It had spent hundreds of years trying to fall down.
    Why dont we end the lecture by pretending were in the Piazza San Marco?
    Im not that uptodate on Star Wars.
    Pretend that Im responding to this completely as an ignoramous...
    Star Wars and Blade Runner in one lectureamazing!
    No handrails. You trip, you fall, you die. Kind of raises the stakes.
    Thats a very silly analogy, actually. Beat it and retract it.
    The Bauhaus would have loved the iPhone.

 English Professor David Simpson
   Matthew Arnold justifies my role as a professor.  That way, Im not just a pompous ass.

   Youre seeing part of the past that is a parlance of knowledge...sorry for the alliteration.
