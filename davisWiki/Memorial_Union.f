 History 


According to the http://vtour.ucdavis.edu/ UCD Vtour, it was dedicated in 1955 to honor 128 UC Davis students and alumni who lost their lives in Veterans military service.  Griffin Lounge houses the Golden Memory Book, which lists all of the names of former UC Davis students who died in the armed services.

At least part of the http://www.ucdavis.edu/history.html $1 million cost was raised by the thennew http://www.ucdavisalumni.com/mission.htm Cal Aggie Alumni Assocation (CAAA).  It was http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/housing.html built on the site of West Hall, which was constructed in 1917 and housed 67 men until 1955.

When originally built the MU was only a http://ulibimage.ucdavis.edu/speccoll/east01/full/B9328.jpg single story building, housing a dining commons, kitchen, faculty club, student lounge, Alumni Association offices, a soda fountain and a student store.   But fund raising campaigns from 1961 to 1968 added the second, third and fourth stories along with the MU Games Area and the UC Davis Bookstore.  It was last renovated in 1996 to bring the seismic safety rating from poor to good, at a cost of $8.4 million.  The 4 story concrete lattice that is visible from the south side of the MU was added at that time to reinforce the building.

In spring of 2007, one of the largest flashmob flashmobs in US history occurred at the ATM machines.

 Areas in the MU 

The MU hosts to several commercial operations, some owned and operated by UC Davis itself, other private businesses that lease space from UC Davis via the MU Auxillary Services department (homepage: http://wwwmuas.ucdavis.edu/).  Other space in the union is devoted to University administrative offices related to students, student government, and various meeting rooms.
