20100611 03:51:19 nbsp i was stenciling on the night of Friday, June 11, 2010 when I was stopped by cops. They jacked my spray paint, cuffed me, finger printed me, got my name address, phone, student id, parents names and addresses , and made me walk hope without my bike even after I explained that the wall was legal to decorate. The email got covered and so I couldnt prove anything. Users/lickedwicked
  Not too many people work on murals in the middle of the night. Everything looks suspicious at that time. If this is supposed to be a legitimate mural, why not work on it in broad daylight? Users/hankim
