The Memorial Union Early Polling Station is located in room 163 across from Classical Notes and next to STA Travel. It first appeared during the 2004 Presidential Election. Early voting for UC Davis was the brainchild of Yolo Country Registar Users/FreddieOakley Freddie Oakley.  It was not in place for the 2006 election, as Oakley said that ASUCD lacked leadership or something and failed to promote voting.  Problems also included student volunteers being (really) late, and the low voter attendance. It is fully operational for the 2008 City Council Election.

No less than 2210 people cast their ballots here in November 2008.


20061101 16:27:39 nbsp Last Year only 400 people used early voting, and while its great that CalPIRG worked so well w/ASUCD on voter reg, ASUCD hasnt worked with anyone on Early Voting. That Said, Early Voting Will Occur at the Davis Senior Center from 10 to 3 this whole week, so Vote Early and Dont Forget or Regret. Users/MaxMikalonis
