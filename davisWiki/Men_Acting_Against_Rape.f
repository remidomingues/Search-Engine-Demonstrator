 Mission Statement 

Men Acting Against Rape (MAAR) is a comprehensive Student Organizations organization whose primary focus is to decrease the prevalence of Sexual Assault sexual assaults, Date Rape rapes and violent acts on campus at Campus UC Davis. Our goals will be realized through various outlets of expression, outreach and education. With the proper guidance and outlook, MAAR will succeed in disseminating the knowledge necessary to prevent the perpetuation of these acts, and ideally, create a network of like institutions that have a similar focus in order to more fully augment the worlds understanding of sexual violence and what can be done to prevent it. We intend to help males realize that their strength is not for hurting, and that they too can help to end this violent plague that affects all of our lives. (From the MAAR Website)

MAAR is supervised by staff at the Womens Center and Campus Violence Prevention Program.
