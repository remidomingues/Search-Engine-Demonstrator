 About Mengalis: 

Mengalis Florist came into existence in 1967 when Memorial Florist was purchased by Douglas and Diane Mengali.    The original building at 2 Main Street in Woodland, CA still houses a Mengalis Florist store.

As the business grew, the Mengalis built a new building for their enterprise at 357 Court Street in Woodland, and in 1972 purchased Atkinsons Florist in Davis, then located in the shopping center on east 8th Street.  The following year, the business was moved to the Brinley building where it now resides.  In 1977, Diane Mengali, a UC Davis Graduate in English, took sole ownership of Mengalis Florist in Davis.

Over the years the store has changed decor and configuration, but our focus remained consistent:  Mengalis Florist will only handle the finest quality floral products and employ the most creative and experienced floral designers in Northern California.  We promise our customers that we will try our very hardest to provide them with knowledgable and sensitive service, and promise to handle their orders with the same care we would give those of our best friends.

The philosophy has served us well and become our Mission Statement.  In 2007, Mengalis Florist celebrated 40 years in business in Yolo County.  We look forward to continuing our service to the community.

 

Their main competition is the Strelitzia Flower Co.


20061018 17:04:59 nbsp Mengalis does really good work.  They have great designers and a nice shop to browse in. Users/AmandaCaudle

20061216 14:35:16 nbsp Beautiful work and very downtown friendly! I found better service here than at Strelitzias and they were a lot friendlier. Users/DebWestergaard

20080317 13:59:29 nbsp It was essential that my $40 bouquet of six tulips (!) get to my girlfriend before noon on Valentines Day, because she had a 3hr. class starting then.  I called twice on the days leading up to Valentines Day to make sure they had noted for their deliverer that my girlfriend lived in the back house, and that the tulips had to be there before noon.  The flowers were delivered at 3:15after my girlfriend had walked around town all day, seeing other women with their flowersand to the front house.  She just happened to be walking home from class and saw the Mengalis guy at the wrong place.  Terrible.  If youre going to get ripped off for a bouquet, you expect at least somewhat decent service.  Get thyself to Strelitzia.   Users/jimmy

20080317 14:04:14 nbsp update:  Reading the comments for Strelitzia, they seem to be no better.  Allow me to add that my girlfriend lives, maybe, three blocks from Mengalis, and that I ordered my bouquet five days in advance.  Whats up with the florists in Davis?  A conspiracy to suck?   Users/jimmy

20080404 11:11:02 nbsp Valentines Day is never the best time in my opinion to judge a florists service...just in sheer bulk of orders, some may get lost/misplaced/delivered late, regardless of how hard the florist tries to prevent it.   Users/AmandaCaudle

20080404 11:23:33 nbsp Jimmy  I am the head designer at Mengalis, and I am very sorry your order was not delivered on time.  We pride ourselves on providing great service, and always hate to hear that something didnt go as planned.  We have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, and if customers are unhappy with the service we provided, we will do everything in our power to make it right...just give us a call.  We hope youll come in and give us a second chance.

Unfortunately, due to demand, wholesale flower costs soar around Valentines Day, resulting in a higher cost to customers.  We try to keep cost as low as possible, but seasonal variations do make a difference in terms of price. Users/SarahLarkin

20080423 19:05:31 nbsp It might be a good place to go for arrangements for some, but 4 me its not... I walked in just today to ask if I could place an order for my boyfriends prom.  I told them that I needed his boutnier and my corsage but as soon as I let them know that the prom date was may 10th they automatically denied me service. I understand that they were going to be busy but they specifically let me know that they were not accepting any orders for prom only for mothers day.  I thought they were rude because they made it seem like what I needed was unimportant and that I didnt deserve service. So if you need to get something for prom or anything else thats NOT for mothers day you better head to Strelitzias they totally will help you out. Users/cjq89

20080423 21:00:01 nbsp Hi cjg 

We apologize to all of our customers that we are unable to accept any orders for Prom this year, due to the fact that it is scheduled on Mothers Day, the second largest floral holiday of the year.  We simply do not have enough resources in our shop to fill orders for both events without sacrificing quality.  We would rather maintain our high quality standards than take orders we may not be able to fill.  Again, our apologies for any inconvenience this has caused, but wed rather deny orders now than fail to fill them once placed. Users/SarahLarkin

20090228 00:34:50 nbsp I went to the store today and was looking for a two bouquets with a budget of $30 each. They didnt look like they had many options of flowers and the small arrangement they showed me as a sample for my bouquet had about four 4 flowers would have been my entire budget! It was really expensive so I went to Sterlitzia where I got two huge and beautiful bouquets. Users/MichVan

20090301 20:22:41 nbsp I truly love this place. Whenever I need a beautiful arrangement in a pinch, they whip something together at whatever price range you want. Im always amazed by how simply they put the bouquets together but how beautiful they are once they do. The flowers are fresh and the recipients of all my bouquets have always been overwhelmed.

20100129 14:50:41 nbsp as of Jan 26th, 2010 I think this place has shutdown Users/flamecrow
