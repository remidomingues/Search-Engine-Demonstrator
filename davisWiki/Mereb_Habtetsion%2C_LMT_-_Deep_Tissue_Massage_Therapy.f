Mereb Habtetsion practices deep tissue massage with a blend of traditional Chinese medicine, specifically tuina. Mereb draws on his experience from his top notch deep tissue training from Art Riggs at the San Francisco School of Massage, as well as his experience working with marginalized populations at the Quan Yin Healing Arts Center in the Mission District of SF.

Mereb brings his compassion and expertise into his studies in the UCD, where he studied the intersection between culture and medicine. When asked about his perspective on Western vs traditional medicine, he said, I have a deep respect for all forms of medicine, traditional and modern. Its my desire to bring an open mind and holistic approach to wellbeing into mainstream medicine where its currently lacking. My goal in practicing massage in Davis is to keep in touch with the healing power of bodywork and stay grounded in my clientcentered practice.




  From therapy to pure relaxation, Davis offers a variety of Massage Services


20120524 11:25:57 nbsp I have a A LOT of massages in my life.  I have a chronic pain problem that requires regular massage.  I was really afraid to book with Mereb because I had been seeing Lily for so long and booking with a guy isnt really my thing. My first massage with Mereb was some what of an out of body experience. I fell asleep it was so relaxing, which has literally never happened to me before.  Honestly I felt reborn.  Since then, Ive gotten all my friends to book with Mereb and we all refer to him as Magic Hands.  As much as I love Eloisa and Lily, Ill only book with them now if I cannot get in with Mereb. There is honestly nothing like a massage with Mereb.  He is the only one who fixes my neck pain, as a result Ive becomes addicted to his magic hands! Users/dina2901
