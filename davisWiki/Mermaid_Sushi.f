Mermaid Sushi operates a takeout service within the Davis Food Coop with a Burmese sushi chef available to prepare custom platters! Several lunchsize combination platters are already prepared and ready to go in a refrigerated case, or customers can either order by phone or on the spot from the short takeout menu. Custom platters are also available, but its suggested you phone such requests in advance.

Prices are fairly reasonable for readymade sushi, and not overly dry, as is sometimes the case with refrigerated sushi. The sixpiece Mermaids Friends nigiri sushi combination included ebi (shrimp), hamachi (yellowtail), two pieces of tuna, salmon, and barbecued eel for $7.50; chopsticks, wasabi, pickled ginger, and a soy sauce packet are included. The fish itself was tender and the sushi prepared well.

Mermaid Sushi is headquartered in Santa Rosa, and operates a team of experienced sushi chefs who provide fresh, daily made, readytogo sushi to grocery stores and supermarkets throughout the United States.

20060128 09:39:11 nbsp Ive been happy with all of the selections that Ive tried. It is made fresh right there, so it may not be like other store sushi that you have tried. Users/JasonAller

20060128 09:51:06 nbsp In my experience, the only downside to this stuff is the fact that Ive had each of their standard offerrings so often that Im a little tired of them.  Definitely high quality for the price. Users/GrahamFreeman

20070716 14:00:21 nbsp I just had some of their nigiri sushi (salmon+eel) and it was pretty good.  Slightly pricy, but I think you get what you pay for ($7.99 gave me 3 LARGE peices of salmon and eel each).  The fish tasted very good and Id definitely get it again. Users/RohiniJasavala

20080320 17:24:33 nbsp Does anyone know where I can buy sushi grade fish for making my own sushi?? Users/dorkboy42
 From East to West:  wiki:Sacramento:Seafood City, wiki:Sacramento:Otos Marketplace,  Fins Market & Grill, wiki:Albany:Tokyo Fish Market. Seafood City and Fins Market & Grill dont seem to be particularly Japanese places though, so they may not be as good as the others for this.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20120113 21:28:22 nbsp Got some sushi takeout today.  Heard about Mermaid Sushi from a couple of friends who recommended, so I went and ordered a Rainbow Roll and a Cali Roll (for the wife).  The owner was very polite and knowledgeable with regards to his fish.  I was impressed by his desire to offer fish from sustainable sources, even taking down some items from the menu because it was on the endangered list.  Real crab in the cali rolls and the salmon and tuna on the Rainbow roll was delicious!   Users/SteveWong
