20090827 22:22:43 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please dont edit other people comments. Users/JasonAller

20120711 18:42:44 nbsp Please read Welcome to the wiki/Business owner.  You will see that you are the one who is violating wiki norms, not me.  The wiki retains history, including old comments.  Also, please refrain from making insulting remarks like troll.  That does not help matters. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 19:08:18 nbsp These comments were made a long time ago and the business has changed since then. It is hurting the facility and they need not be there. Im sorry I called you a troll. Please dont revert the page.  Users/Merritt

20120711 19:40:46 nbsp But you are going against longstanding wiki practice.  In what way has the business changed?  Has the ownership changed, for example?  One alternative is to put the comments on a different page and then link to them  people refer to this as archiving.  The comments are still there, but they are less obvious. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 19:42:24 nbsp Ok, so you want ME to go through the effort to archive in face of YOUR bad behavior.  Fine, I will do so.  I love doing work for people who call me a troll and who accuse me of doing the wrong thing when they are the ones doing the wrong thing.  I love working with people who claim to know what how things work when they dont. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 19:43:21 nbsp Please try to understand the difference between false, outdated, and opinion. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 19:44:04 nbsp I dont know how to archive. I dont spend time on wiki often. If you would do that instead of revert, I would appreciate it. All I want to do is help a business that I patronize. I am not personal friends with the owners. Major construction has happened since the comments were posted. The facility is different now and is in no way a health hazard as the first comment states. The rules said you could delete false comments.  Users/Merritt

20120711 19:47:02 nbsp There is a different between old and false.  Anyway, I archived for you.  Next time, please try to work with other editors instead of making insults and asserting your right to do the wrong thing. Users/CovertProfessor

20120711 19:48:57 nbsp They were both old and false. I appreciate your help.  Users/Merritt
