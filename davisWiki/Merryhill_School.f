20080905 09:28:01 nbsp Very unprofessional. I had an appointment and when I got there the manager had left to go meet with someone else and did not call to cancel our meeting to view the school. I was a new mother at the time, and getting my kid ready and out the door took a lot of effort only to arrive there to be stood up. I have also heard some bad things about the setup from others.

20080905 21:46:10 nbsp I had an appointment today and the staff was very helpful. The place was clean, the kids looked happy and the cirriculum sounded great. I will probably be enrolling my kids soon. Users/HankLA

20081217 12:21:51 nbsp Seemed okay for the preK and kindergarten levels, but awful for the higher grades.  Withdrew my child after a terrible third year there.  Teachers were often low on experience and behaved inappropriately, administrators were not helpful, and curriculum was average.  I would not recommend this school to anyone.   Users/CTita

20081218 22:05:18 nbsp Many dedicated teachers, who really care about their students.  My daughter has been at the preschool site on La Vida for several years, and is very wellcared for.  At the elementary site, they really provide a lot of great experiences.  This year, they only go up to third grade, but contrary to the other comment, the second and third grade teachers are very experienced and dedicated.  Kindergarten students go for a full day, and most of the kids Ive seen were doing work that would be equivalent to first graders and above.   Users/Bookbelle

20081226 14:10:02 nbsp I also removed my child from the school after two years of dealing with the lousy teachers.  Hopefully they are working on the things that were lacking a couple of years ago when my child was enrolled.  The parents who have kids enrolled there seem to be supportive of the current curriculumbut the loss of enrollment in the upper grades tells a different story. Users/RHeinman

20090309 14:55:51 nbsp My kids are enrolled in the two first grade classes.  Both first grade teachers are outstanding.  The environment is very supportive and the teachers and the administration are responsive to concerns and needs.  I am very happy with the school.   Users/mitogirl

20090625 23:21:53 nbsp Do not sign your children for the preschool. Teachers are very unprofessional and classrooms are not as they seem to be. Infant and toddler room teachers are inattentive to the infants/toddlers. Hard to communicate with some nonEnglish speaking teachers.  Users/Davismommy

20090629 12:03:50 nbsp We have had three kids at one or both schools for the past five years and we love the professionalism of the staff at both campuses. We think the kids get a firstrate education and really benefit from the best student/teacher ratio in the area.    Users/DonLipper

20091117 11:37:42 nbsp We love the Davis Merryhill Schools!  We moved to Davis in 2000 and have had 13 boys attending ever since for a total of 16 student years.  Our boys are thriving academically and socially.  We have had wonderful teachers every year.  The dedication of the teachers and the professionalism of the principal and all the staff reflects in our childrens smiling faces!  As a family with 2 working professionals, the before and after school care is a necessity.  The structured care available during these hours allows the children continued learning opportunities (and getting their homework done at school!) and not only freeplay.  We have also utilized various other afterschool programs including soccer, swimming, music, and others.  Great programs and very convenient.  Our oldest son aged out and has been excelling in the public school GATE program.  We highly recommend  both Davis Merryhill Campuses!  Questions?  Ask me.  rodlayman@mac.com Users/rodlayman

20091117 14:53:37 nbsp Parents at our elementary school are very pleased with the 21st Century curriculum and the small class sizes. We offer a positive learning environment where students excel accademically, socially and physically. The faculty is professional, credentialed and committed to the success of each student. You are invited to make an appointment for a tour and your child is always welcome to spend a Discovery Day with us. Users/clandry

20091117 21:01:59 nbsp One of our children has been at the elementary school for 3 years and we will still continue. Our daughter just entered kindergarten and is now reading since 4 months in school without previous knowledge of her ABCs. The new principal has made great staff changes and we are extremely happy about the challenging curriculum. The school has brought in after school activities on campus that help working families. The flag football and ballet classes rock! I would heavily recommend this school.  Users/kdonecker

20091212 16:30 We love Merryhill Davis. Our oldest son attended from PreK through 3rd grade and our youngest (currently in 3rd grade) has been at Merryhill since he was 6 weeks old. The teachers here are awsome! Caring, committed, responsive, and passionate about teaching. Although students at Merryhill excell academically, this school teaches for the whole child  not just the highest test scores. My third grader has a daily planner and his teacher holds weekly class meetings to talk about mutual respect and conflict resolution. Because of this, the students in this school are amazing people (not just great students). If you want to see what this school is really all about, drop in on one of the monthly assemblies and watch the students cheer each other on for making the honor roll or winning a spelling bee  you wont find anything else like it in the city of Davis.

20091218 11:13:05 nbsp Our twin daughters attend kindergarten at Merryhill Elementary.  Their teacher, Kathy Peterson, is wonderful.  Shes experienced.  Shes caring.  Shes enthusiastic.  Its hard to say enough wonderful things about her.   Users/JenniferHolman
