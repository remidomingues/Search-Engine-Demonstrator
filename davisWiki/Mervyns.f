Mervyns was a Clothing stores clothing store. The store offered clothing and other items that were generally cheaper in price than Macys but more expensive than discount retailers like Kmart or Walmart. Mervyns was founded in San Lorenzo, California and headquartered in Hayward. It grew from one Bay Area store to a chain that spanned several Western States. However, the chain was bought by Dayton Hudson Corporation (now called Target Corporation) and the chain gradually declined until it was sold to private investors.

The lease for the Woodland Mervyns store was acquired by the Encino Developer Raymond Arjmand who bought the Woodland mall  in 2006. The former Mervyns store on Arden Way in Sacramento has been leased to Kohls Department Store. Kohls will completely remodel the store and open their new store sometime in 2010.

The Mervyns name and website were bought at an auction by the sons of the original founder Mervin Morris. They hope to open new stores under the Mervyns name.
