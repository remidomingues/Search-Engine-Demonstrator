Not to be confused with Massage Envy.

Message Envy is the sensation that one gets when they are browsing the Recent Changes of Daviswiki and seeing a lot of people commenting and writing messages to other Wiki Users and yet no one seems to give their templates/person personal page any I Love Davis love.

This sensation is absolutely no different from the jealousy that arises when someone else on Flickr, Facebook, Myspace are getting wall posts / comments / etc. and yet you have nothing on your own page.  This is part of a bigger phenomena online wherein the internet user feels as though he/she is an insignificant piece of the everenlarging worldwide web.

Just because you dont get explicit thanks, dont assume your efforts are going unnoticed.  Sometimes youre simply making really nice edits that theres no real need to comment on, but plenty of your fellow editors have great respect for your contributions.
