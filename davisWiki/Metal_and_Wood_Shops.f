There are several metal and wood shops in Davis, on campus and off:

Open to the Public

  The Craft Center has both types of shops and welding, prices vary by resources used.


Students Only

  The Art Building has both a wood shop and a metal shop.  I believe that it is technically reserved for UCD art students that are taking an art class, most commonly a sculpture class.  They have many hand tools and also a big sander, grinder, bandsaw (big one and small one), table saw (with autostop function if you slip your hand onto the blade on accident), radial arm saw, and a few others that are broken.  The metal shop (which is outdoors but covered) has a lot of hulking machines and I dont know what they do.  You can weld here.  Gilbert is the shoptech as of 2008, and there are several volunteer monitors that come in at assorted hours throughout the week to make the shop available to more people.

  Roessler Hall has both a metal and wood shop.  They offer a machine shop engineering class here.

  Walker Hall should have a shop, if the Design Department wants to hold the design title, but I dont believe it does.  The Furniture Design room (TB102, next to Walker) probably has some kind of tools, though Im not sure what they have and it seems very closed off to non Design 135B (Furniture Design)  takers.

  Davis Senior High School has a metal shop.
  Holmes Junior High School has a metal shop and a wood shop.
  Emerson Junior High School has a wood shop.
