Metallikato


Since I moved to Davis in Fall 2010, Ive practically lived off of the Freshman Guide and the Wiki in general (and wandered around like a lost goose a few times), but havent come around to actually contributing it until this year. Im still working on my people skills. Ive avoided the Freshman Stripe and found my way to Navins Copy Shop without any help, but Im sure theres a lot more for me to master in order to survive here at UCD.

After Computer Science didnt work out for me in 20102011, Ive decided to go the versatile route and switch to English. I can write 9page essays far better than I write simple .c files in Linux. The most love I can harbor for computers will forever be the result of my escapades with Photoshop and other image software Im a digital and traditional artist whose muse keeps running away from her, as well as an avid Transformers junkie who reads too much for her own good. I am working on improving my grades (dont give me that look, I told you Im working on it!) and building myself into the mature, savvy young woman I know I can become. Thanks, Davis Wiki, youre saving my life one step at a time.

 Why I Dont Use MichelleRamirez 
I understand that using my real name establishes a Importance of using your RealName degree of credibility that is linked to my comments, but honestly, Id rather be known for Metallikatos great studentPOV insight than for MichelleRamirezs seemingly meaningless comments. For the most part, Metallikato is the name I go by, and I am proud enough of my activities under that name to use it here on the Davis Wiki. Theres always proof that I exist, because as far as the UCD Directory goes, http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/directory_results.shtml?id00615063 its public information.

Plus, Michelle Ramirez sounds like such a general Hispanic name that I hear way too many times on the news or online. It feels weird for me to write it.
