20080530 15:12:33 nbsp Howdy, and welcome to the wiki!  Youre adding some great information, but it doesnt look like it is yours to add: you cant simply copy somebody elses words unless they have told you that you can.  You can copy from the wiki, because thats allowed by the Copyrights copyright for the wiki, but you cant just take other peoples works and put them on the wiki.  You either need to get permission or have written it yourself: the wiki as you see it today has been written by people like you over the course of several years.

20080530 15:22:33 nbsp Thanks, Evan. Im a volunteer with United Animal Nations Emergency Animal Rescue Service (UAN EARS), and one of our jobs as volunteers is to provide disaster preparedness information in our local communities. The wiki seemed a perfect candidate for that. Since it is an official part of my duties with EARS, do I need more permission that just a credit on the page? Users/MettaDogTraining
   Nope, if the site you are copying the text from is releasing the text as public domain (which they dont appear to be, as they say at the bottom of every page Â© 2006 UNITED ANIMAL NATION), then you can copy it... otherwise you simply cant.  Youll have to rewrite it in your own words.  On the other hand, the nice thing is that anybody will be able to copy your version from then on.  There are some similar entries already on the wiki... check out the links from the entry on dogs, for instance.  Its a great idea, and there are already a couple points here and there on disaster planning that mention animals and their care, but no single resource.  The nice thing about writing it is that you can make it specific to Davis, Yolo County and the region, so people can find local resources for assistance or locally relevant tips.  For instance, theres little reason to have information about how to survive a blizzard, but it would be really useful to list which Yolo county shelters accept animals.

20080530 15:37:41 nbsp Thanks for the clarification. Now Im confused! ;) Ill be working at an EARS booth this weekend at the Sacramento Doggie Dash, so Ill ask them to clarify how/what materials we can use verbatim to promote disaster planning in our communities, and how that translates to their website content (since education is a major part of our volunteer duties during nondisaster times, which is most of the time). And I can rewrite the info fairly easily, make it Davis specific, and look into local and regional petfriendly hotels, etc. Thanks! Users/MettaDogTraining
   No problem.  You basically need to know if you can release the text under Creative Commons (theres a link at the very bottom of every wiki page in a box that links to the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode actual license, and theres a link from there to the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode legalese version).  Good luck, and enjoy the Doggie Dash!  jw
  Thanks. The pages have been removed for now. Have a great weekend.
