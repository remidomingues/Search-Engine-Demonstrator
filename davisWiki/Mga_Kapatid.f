Established during the 19691970 school year, Mga Kapatid (MK), Tagalog for My Siblings or My Brothers and Sisters, is a social, cultural, and academic organization for the Pilipino American community at UCD. Other organizations have stemmed from Mga Kapatid, including Filipino Association for Health Careers (FAHC), BRIDGE: Pilipino/a Outreach and Retention Program, and Filipinos in Liberal Arts and Humanities (FILAH), which are all part of the FilAm at UC Davis FilAm Community.

Their mission statement is, The purpose of this organization shall be to provide personal, social, cultural and academic support; to spread political awareness and consciousness on issues relevant to the Pilipino American community; to support and encourage the purposes and activities of BRIDGE: Pilipino/a Outreach and Retention Program, Chi Rho Omicron (XPO), Filipino Association for Health Careers (FAHC), Filipinos in Liberal Arts and Humanities (FILAH), Kappa Psi Epsilon (KPsiE), and Pilipino Americans in Science and Engineering (PASE); to enhance appreciation for Pilipino culture and heritage; to promote appreciation for, and develop the significance of the Pilipino community in the University of California, Davis and in today’s society; and to always aspire to maintain an organizational atmosphere that lives up to our name, Mga Kapatid.

Events & Programs
Mga Kapatid also has its own Big Sib/Lil Sib Program (BS/LS). It is a peer mentorship program that partners a Big Sib, an established UC Davis student, with a Lil Sib, usually an incoming freshman or transfer student. Big Sib’s mentor their Lil Sib’s through their transition into the university by serving as a personal and social resource, from offering advice to providing academic tutoring. BS/LS pairings occur at the beginning of each quarter, for more information please contact the current BS/LS coordinators.

During Fall quarter, MK participates in Friendship Games in Fullerton, CA during the month of October. Friendship Games is hosted by CSU Fullerton and is an event for all the FilAm clubs in California, Nevada, and Hawaii to come together and play picnic games against each other. Mga Kapatid practices the games throughout fall quarter leading up to Friendship Games in the grassy area of the quad.

The largest event is the annual wiki:davis:Pilipino Culture Night in May. PCN is a completely studentrun event that showcases the Pilipino and PilipinoAmerican culture through scripts, acting, singing, and dances. Practices occur every Sunday in Wellman Hall from 12:00 PM  6:00 PM.

Other events hosted by Mga Kapatid include FilAm Thanksgiving Dinner (November), Tahoe Trip (February), and MK Bash (June).
