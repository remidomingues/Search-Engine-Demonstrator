20081001 22:57:22 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Michael, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for creating the Davis Students for Nader entry.  I assumed it was a UC Davis group (as there are many schools here in Davis), and added some links to the entry.  I also linked to it from the Student Organizations entry.  You may want to browse a couple of the organization entries to get an idea of what kind of information might be useful on the entry.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
