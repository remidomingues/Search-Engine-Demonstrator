So about me:

Hey. My name is Michael Woods and I am a X4th year physics major at UCDX Xfirst yearX Xsecond yearX Xthird yearX fourth year grad student in the physics department. This means  the department has turned me into a brainless, sleepless, nearfriendless, zombie of a man. I teach various classes and love doing it, but try to stick to getting students through the Physics 7 series.

Classes Ive Taught:
 Phy 7A DL
 Phy 7B DL X 2
 Phy 7C DL
 Phy 9C DL

I work an a dark matter detection experiment named LUX. Its at the bottom of a very deep mine in South Dakota.

The The California Aggie Aggie is practically a public nuisance; my friends nor I have ever been correctly quoted, I despise their office (bad memories trying to deal with them during fire drills), and find a majority of their comics pathetic.

Whew Sorry bout that. I believe that racquetball is great for winter fun. I XparticipateX used to participate in as many P.E. classes as I would (whether signed up or not) because the best forms of exercise are those that are fun, but havent seen a P.E. class since undergraduate... To overcome an ankle injury Ive taken up cycling in and around Davis (surprise!). Without a car, I now find myself biking as a mode of transportation and a major part of my exercise.

Wiki pages I think should get more attention:
  Apartment Matrix
  MonthtoMonth Rental Agreement

Enough about me. //

20080913 18:08:07 nbsp My theory about the featured page is that most all of the wiki editors who feel confident enough to change it dont ever look at the Front Page.  However, most everyone who comes to the wiki comes to the Front Page. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20090219 00:19:02 nbsp Its generally considered bad form to alter a persons comments except to fix wiki markup (runaway bold, bad links, botched lists). David Poole, of all people, knows how to edit the wiki and he left his comment the way he did intentionally. Not everything on the wiki has to conform to the output of the comments macro. In fact, we didnt use it on Davis Wiki for some period of time. Users/WilliamLewis
