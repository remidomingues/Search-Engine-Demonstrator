20081230 15:32:15 nbsp Howdy!  Keep in mind that the entry for Mason Thomas is only topical for some of the many wikis on Wiki Spot, not all of them.  I deleted the entry you created at the hub, as people in China, Germany or Canada likely arent interested (or, say, the Linux Users Group in Nashville, TN).  You might want to add it to some local wikis like the wiki:Sacramento Sacramento Wiki, however. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
