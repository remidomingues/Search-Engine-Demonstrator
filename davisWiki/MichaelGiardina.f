 Michael Giardinas publication in Newsweek: Current 
One of his nonfiction opinion columns went to print in Newsweek: Current (The Last Word). If you would like to read the column, MSNBC Has picked it up at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9073287/site/newsweek/ Amusingly enough, a copy of the column was inserted into a recent issue of The California Aggie the Aggie, but it fell out of most papers.
