Hello fellow Davisites,

My name is Mike.  Ive been a Davisite on and off for over ten years now.  Ill be graduating with a degree in religious studies from UCD this summer, at long last.

You may know me from class or from Alpha Gamma Omega ChristCentered Fraternity or from Orthodox Christian Fellowship.  I also love coffee, so maybe weve met at one of Daviss many coffee shops.

Ive been an Eastern Orthodox Christian for about as long as Ive been a Davisite.  Its possible weve talked church once or twice.

I love Davis, and will sorely miss it when I finally leave.  Most folks here are community and ecologicallyminded, and genuine.  The local community and the university community are closely affiliatedsuch a relationship is a rare gem in our age.  Oh, and the bike culture rocks.
