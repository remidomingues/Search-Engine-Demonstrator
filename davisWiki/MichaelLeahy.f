20080319 16:36:44 nbsp Michael: Its Greg Giles, from 20 Minute Loop.  Sorry if my friendrequest message confused you.  I realize youre not the booker for DofV; as it turns out, I think were too loud for that venue.  But if any good night comes up at Sophias, let us know.  I would like to try to do that Tartufi/20ML bill again (sadly rained out last autumn).  Im resorting to this comments page because I cant send a message via MySpace because somehow, we are not your friend, even though I think we used to be.  So, here I am.  Hope youre well.  Thanks, Michael.  Greg, 20ML Users/greggiles

20090612 19:42:44 nbsp Dont believe the rumors! Michael Leahy is in fact real (and cool as folk)â€”I have had numerous Michael Leahy sightings. In my experience, serenades and house shows at which people are sitting on the floor are strong Michael Leahy lures. Users/WillSim
