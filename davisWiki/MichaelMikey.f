20120201 10:44:53 nbsp Since there are a number of people involved, the best bet at this point might be to move discussion about this topic over to the Wiki Community/Glossary Talk page for Boardwalk, located Boardwalk Apartments/Talk here. Users/TomGarberson

20120201 10:58:32 nbsp I copied your question on my user page over onto the talk page and answered it there, since other people might have different responses that they want to contribute as well.  There are many different ideas about exactly what role the wiki plays in the community. Users/TomGarberson
