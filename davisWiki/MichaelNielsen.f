20110414 16:00:12 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  The You know you have been in Davis too long if page you created has really taken off!  Nicely done.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20110414 17:51:18 nbsp Thanks :)

As a dog friendliness expert, where would you go for a Sequoia forest where we can take our dog for a stroll?
Seems Muir woods is off limits, and at Yosemite its only 1 trail thats paved that allows dogs. I dont know if that one has Sequoias, though. Users/MichaelNielsen
  You cant take them into Sequoia National Park itself  or any national park, as far as I know.  However, I am pretty sure that are trails in Sequoia National Forest, right next to Sequoia National Park, that are dog friendly.  Let me know if you cant find anything with a web search, and Ill dig through my materials.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110414 20:19:01 nbsp It is a bit farther than a one day trip, but I see there are two dog friendly inns in Porterville and it is pretty cheap by EU standards. Looks like there are many groves there in the  Seq. Nat. Forest. Any of them youd recommend?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_Basin seems really nice.
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_Mountain_Grove but it seems part of it is in the park and the other part is monument (which shares the same rules for dogs as forest).

I have been to the National park before, Wuchsachi lodge, sherman and the crystal cave, in 2004. So going to the national forest area will be new for me as well. First thing when my fiancee (in EU) wakes up Ill suggest a weekend trip there :)
I was thinking of Yosemite, but I guess thats a bit clich√©d as a first time visit to USA for her  go right for the lesser known (in EU) but even better site for some magical Sequoia quality time  Perfect after a tour at Sequoia Grove winery :D Users/MichaelNielsen
 I had thought that some of the trails I had hiked were in one of the national forests, but I just looked through all of my maps and realized that the trails were all in the national parks (i.e., before I had a dog).  I think what I am remembering is that we talked about taking our dog to the national forests (Redwood and Sierra), but then we never did.  So, sorry I cant offer any trail advice.  I would definitely check the weather before you go, though, because I imagine there is still snow up there this time of year.  As for Yosemite vs Sequoia  Yosemite is beautiful, but it gets so crowded.  As you say, Sequoia is magical and you can really appreciate the trees because you can get away from the crowds.  Good luck with your trip planning  let me know how it goes!   Users/CovertProfessor

20110421 07:14:32 nbsp I had noticed the lack of UCD Medical Group page a while back, but didnt get into it.  Since you know a bit about whats there, why not go ahead and create the page yourself?  Its easy to do! Users/TomGarberson

  done :) Users/MichaelNielsen

20110422 19:59:39 nbsp Thanks for getting that page going! Users/TomGarberson

20110424 04:29:01 nbsp Wow, thats what I bike almost every day when I decide to bike to school. Also, I feel like you and I would get along. Dexter, Chuck, cheese, dogs, hedonism, and classical liberalism. Unless of course, you didnt mean dogs as in for eating. Users/hankim

  lol, eating dogs  Ive been to china, but I did not order gau, cats, scorpions, etc. I did try their 50% alc rice wine with peanuts and all the waters were whispering and looking at this strange foreigner who dared try their rice wine and ordered from the part of the menu thats for chinese ppl, as they are used to foreigners sticking to their western section food :)

20110519 16:40:26 nbsp Thanks for the recommendation, sounds like a lot of fun! Users/TomGarberson

20110524 14:21:10 nbsp Liberal does not mean limited government in America. Neither does conservative unfortunately.  Users/hankim

Liberal means stupid elitist assholes who likes to crap on hard working Americans and steal their money to give to illegal immigrants.

  Were you at the Fiddlehead library wine tasting this saturday?

20110709 22:37:24 nbsp Cows Sure.  Actually, Id say its the average of what you expect when chatting with a random stranger.  It varies from town to town, region to region.  The attitude, the viewpoint, the orientation toward life and all the things we deal with, abstract and concrete.   Ive been in towns where the average was skewed well away from my perspective, but still found good people... and of course you can find jackasses everywhere.  But each place has a set of social assumptions, what is acceptable, what isnt.  Davisness is that particular set that Davis has.

Of course, Im answering having no idea what prompted the question.  Was there a particular reason you asked?   Users/JabberWokky

   Well, I created the page, that you posted on about hoping to find some Davisness in another town, with the idea that we could pinpoint what makes Davis ... well.. Davis. Also as a foreigner living in Davis it is hard to distinguish what I can contribute to it being Davis versus California versus USA vs the micro cultures I hang out in here in Davis. People ask me in my own country how its like here and it sounds very different, and then we have to be careful to generalize  is it how it is in the US, CA, or just Davis. One example is that I can talk to a stranger who is using my favourite brand of skates here in Davis for half an hour, while in Denmark, they would assume Im a wacko for talking to a stranger. You also wont find communitybased supermarkets, nor hang out at the local restaurant like you can do here in Davis. I just dont know if I should tell the tale as  thats how it is in the US or thats how CA is or if its just good old Davis.

20110725 13:39:28 nbsp Congratulations, Michael, that is very good news, and I am glad you were able to find the proper site for your proposal!  Which trails in Yosemite are open to dogs?  I had thought that dogs were prohibited from all U.S. National Parks, except for campgrounds and other developed areas. Users/CovertProfessor
    Yes, but there are some places which are nice walks: http://dogfriendly.com/server/travel/uscities/guides/w/FOLDERca/wonlineca3720200yo.shtml . We left the dog in the car as it was snowing with windows slightly open, so no chance of overheating, while we had a quick walk around Mariposa Grove (where we saw others walk their dogs! Grrr)

20110728 07:59:07 nbsp Do you have a Google Voice number?  Its only 2 cents per minute to land lines in Denmark, 19 cents per minute to mobile phones.  You can use it from any cell phone or land line, since youre calling a local number (your Google Voice number) and its calling internationally. Users/TomGarberson
