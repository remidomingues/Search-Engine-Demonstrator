20100131 19:06:27 nbsp Hello. Youre not editing yet, but I dont think youll mind my greeting. Thanks for being clueful enough to Importance of using your RealName use your realname. Youd be surprised how many people dont go that route.

In case you havent already, take a look at Welcome to the Wiki. Were run a lot different from Wikipedia, which leads to some confusion for some folks. Feel free to edit the entries you look at directly instead of confining your thoughts and opinions to the ghetto that is the comments section.

Im looking forward to reading what you have to say about King Hall and Southern California. Dont let the Norcal Rage get you down!
