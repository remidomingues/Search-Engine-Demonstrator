I identify myself as a prepostmodern logical positivist, acediawielding, scienceloving but lexicallyleaning, concinnityseeking, progressive nihilistcumsanguine (though we all and me especially appear to be totally fucked), insomniac botanist atheist.

I am currently an Associate Professor and chair of Life Sciences at Mt. San Jacinto College in San Jacinto, CA.

I am a botanist.

My areas of concentration include systematics, ethnobotany, evolution, and science (particularly biology and even more particularly plant biology) education.

are you a fan of carnivorous plants? Users/StevenDaubert

20121230 22:01:58 nbsp StevenDaubert: I do appreciate carnivorous plants, though my primary loves among the vegetation are seedless vascular plants (ferns and such) and some odd flowering plants, like the meadowfoams (vernal pool plants), which I did some research on as a student at UCD. Of course, I am loath to play favorites, and my official position is that all plants are absolutely, utterly and unconditionally keen.

Thanks for noticing the graph and editing on the pizza page! I created the graph by way of helping my son with an 8th grade project on pizza. We have been developing a rating system combining qualitative and quantitative assessments. Stay tunedwe will roll it out eventually.  Users/MichaelPlotkin
