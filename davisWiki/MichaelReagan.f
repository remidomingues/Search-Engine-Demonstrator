You can often find Mike in MU360 typing away at a computer, fighting global warming, working on institutionalizing voter registration, fighting hunger and homelessness, or something equally as public interest related.  If not, hes either Sleeping on campus sleeping in class or getting a burrito from the CoHo.  You can reach him at (530) 7523205.  This is actually the CalPIRG office number, but theres a 90% chance that either hell be there to talk to you, or that someone there will be able to tell you how to reach him.  This is mostly because he is the Chair of CalPIRG here at Davis.

Mike is a third year History (major) History major from Oakland (Oakland As go As!).
