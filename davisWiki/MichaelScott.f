20090510 12:29:53 nbsp This establishment changed ownership and they probably decided to continue the old business and added another franchise by this name (Chaat Cafe) to it. I thought it appropriate to have its own page as this is the new name by which its known to the Indian community in the rest of Northern California region. I would never have guessed there was a Chaat Cafe in the Davis area had I not looked up the Chaat Cafe website for locations. I think the street sign has also been changed to Chaat Cafe now.

20090510 12:44:02 nbsp I moved your comment to the existing page, and then renamed the existing page (because the other page already had photos and comments). The other thing that should be noted is that there used to be a New Delhi Chaat Cafe in town, so there could be name confusion there. Users/JasonAller

20090510 15:28:04 nbsp I swung by there and a quick glance at their sign seemed to confirm that they were going by the name Chaat Cafe; the number 217 was above that, but it wasnt clear in my quick look if that was part of the name or not. Users/JasonAller

20090510 22:29:39 nbsp Thanks for doing that, may be I should have done that but didnt know the original name of the place to look it up and really wanted to put in a good word for it. Anyway, glad that some confusion is cleared up. Users/MichaelScott
