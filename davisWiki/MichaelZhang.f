As for the Grace Valley stuff, lighten up. People criticize stuff on the internet. Some of it is justified. A lot of it isnt. If you believe something just because its on the internet, youre a moron. We allow the criticisms to remain here and allow the readers to make up their mind. Its better than letting the page turn into a Grace Valley lovefest or a onesided burn piece. Users/WilliamLewis
