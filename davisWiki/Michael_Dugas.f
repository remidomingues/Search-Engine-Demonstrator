Mike Dugas was a Statistics PhD student at UC Davis from 20002005. He earned his PhD in June of 2005.  If youve taken STA 13 you might have had him as your instructor!  He was active in the Davis College Republicans and actually made a bid for a seat in the House of Representives (in the 5th Congressional District) in 2004.  He ran against the late Democratic Congressman wiki:WikiPedia:Robert_Matsui Robert Matsui.  With 23.4% (http://vote2004.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/0500.htm 45,120 cast to him) of the vote, he lost to Robert Matsui but certainly made a good showing http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/11/15/FrontPage/Gerrymandered.Districts.Offer.Learning.Experiences.For.Young.Politicians1318744.shtml considering that he was a complete newcomer to national politics. Political analysts and State Party officals saw his 2004 run for Congress as a training zone for potential political ventures for the future.

   Robert Matsui passed away in the time between the election and the beginning of his term. No word yet on whether Mike Dugas will run again in the special election. All his campaign manager, George Andrews will say is that at this time, we will respect Robert Matsui and put aside politics and celebrate his life. When asked directly, Mike said no comment.

Born in 1977 in Miami, Florida, Mike grew up in South Florida during his childhood years. He attended college at the University of Florida, earning his Masters Degree in Statistics there in May of 2000. Dugas attended UC Davis to pursue his doctorate in statistics. He currently works for Capital One in Richmond, VA.

Dugas involvement in politics began in 2001, immediately after he arrived in California from Florida. He became a vocal conservative Davis Politics political campus activist, after being shocked by what he perceived as a liberal university establishment at UC Davis. His innovative political ideas on campus often garnered the attention of local, state and national media ranging from the Sacramento Bee to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Through this, he quickly rose to become the 200304 State CoChairman of the California College Republicans.
