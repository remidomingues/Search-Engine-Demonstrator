Instructor in violin at UC Davis since 1997, received his B.A. from Swarthmore College and a M.M. from the Yale University School of Music, studying with Broadus Erle of the Yale Quartet.  After graduation, he joined the San Francisco Opera Orchestra and played principal second violin of the Oakland Symphony.  He was one of the original directors of Philharmonia, the first period instrument orchestra on the West Coast, while commuting to Europe to work with such leading Baroque groups as Les Arts Florissants and La Chapelle Royale.  He also founded Archangeli Baroque Strings, whose recordings of concerti grossi by Bach and Vivaldi have won high notices.  He is currently the Musical Director of NYS Baroque, an original instrument orchestra in upstate New York.  Equally at home on the modern and Baroque violin, Sands interest in the stylistic approach to music has taken him in recent years to a reinvestigation of 19th century Romantic literature, which in turn led to collaborations with the University Symphony Orchestra UC Davis Symphony Orchestra in performances of the Mendelssohn and Beethoven violin concertos,  Sand has recorded for Meridian, Harmonia Mundi (both in France and the United States), Art and Music, KATastroPHE, Wildboar, and Titanic Records.  He also teaches at the San Francisco Early Music Societys Baroque Music Workshop.
