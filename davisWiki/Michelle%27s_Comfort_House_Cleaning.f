20111227 15:36:30 nbsp Used them for my moveout to make sure I could get the apartment fully cleaned.  My security deposit was 2400 so spending around 150 to get a three hour deep cleaning in the kitchen, living room and bathrooms made a lot of sense.  Michelle and her associate did a fantastic job, they even managed to save the stove which had previously been in a fire and had tons of extinguisher residue that I could not get rid of.

20120831 10:29:54 nbsp Used them for moveout cleaning as well. They were forty minutes late for the appointment (7AM appointment, so understandable I guess, but they seemed completely disorganized) and I really did not have much time to check over everything before turning in my keys. I guess they missed quite a few things and we got only about a quarter of the deposit back. I used Heavenly Touch the previous year and they were quite professional and I did not get charged for anything so I guess if I had a choice, I would have used Heavenly Touch.Users/hankim

20130507 18:05:42 nbsp I Used this Company To Clean my mothers home in Davis( which she is an older woman and cannot do these things herself). I spoke with Phil on the phone and he was very nice and was able to get me on the schedule for the next day. When the girls came out,  They were prompt, clean, friendly and worked very quickly. I live in the bay area and wish they cleaned there, the rates were much lower then i am used to. My mother was very pleased with the services as i was. I will have them out to clean once a month now.  Users/tammaralagua
