Users/johndudek Mike is wiki:vacaville: not a resident, like wiki:WikiPedia:Lafayette,_Louisiana not a resident at all, or a  wiki:WikiPedia:University_of_Louisiana_at_Lafayette student, or Davis Groupies member of some Society of Wiki Restaurant Reviewers secret group, and that Northern California hella bothers you. User Statistics What the hell is she thinking?! (She front page loves you and people everyone else on the wiki.)

She loved and once lived at wiki:sacramento:Sacramento International Airport SMF. Shes Users/alexnorris the greatest http://www.airliners.net/ aviatrix the world has ever known. How does she do it?

She loves http://daviswiki.org/Cows?actionFiles&doview&targetcowatgate.jpg this picture, and Wiki Sand box the sandbox, because it looks like it was made by Users/AndrewBanta a completely crazy person.

She does not suffer from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v7VaekonGz4 Ninjitis. Though she does have a problem with taking http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelleaccurso/ too many pictures.



20070218 19:05:21 nbsp I thought the comment (based on the history) was aimed at you.  If not, feel free to change it.  It was part of trying to clear out the entries with zero links (i.e., dead ends).  I did enough this morning so that it wouldnt surprise me if I got a couple wrong.  No insult intended, of course... just trying to figure out what that edit was was a bit difficult. Users/JabberWokky

20070926 10:47:05 nbsp Michelle, Im fine but YOU need to edit another page!! (E.G. I just dont want DW to be your last edit.) I went through SMF in June, but you were hiding behind the scenes. Users/DougWalter
  I was flying Northwest, b/c I was going through MSP to LaCrosse, WI (!!)

20080310 20:24:04 nbsp Well, despite my nonexistence, I do play from time to time (although I lack the time to practice at the moment :(  Perhaps this summer, my fiddle will come out to play.)  Ive not tried strings on my violin other than Dominants up to this point, but this does not mean that there are not better ones that would be worth trying instead.  Which strings do you use, and why do you prefer them?  What do you play? Users/IDoNotExist

20080531 21:25:03 nbsp If you dont like Dominant, then you should use Evah Pirazzi or Vision. Ifshin is definitely good. But Watermelon is not bad at all. You should meet their string salesman. Hes good. Users/BuyLocal

20091109 23:16:22 nbsp Hey now, I left it in the history, should you wish to view it in all its glory.  Of course, I also contacted Yahoo and they shut down the account, so theres a limited amount of usefulness to it now.  But if you really want, I can forward you some of my email spam and well call it good. Users/JabberWokky
