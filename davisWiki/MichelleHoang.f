Thats not removing outdated content or editing relevant information. In the future, please respect the contributions of others on the wiki. Users/WilliamLewis

20120327 15:26:50 nbsp My apologies. I found that a lot of those criticisms were from several years back, and thought it would be alright to remove irrelevant ones. Ill leave them as is. However, will I be allowed to remove the outdated information about previous years coordinators and the like? That stuffs pretty irrelevant now, and the space could be used better. Users/MichelleHoang

20120327 15:36:11 nbsp Michellelets find a way to keep the old coordinators info for posterity please. Users/PeterBoulay

20120327 15:39:56 nbsp Alright, thank you! Ill think about what I want to write a little more before editing the page, then. Users/MichelleHoang

20120327 15:49:53 nbsp One option might be to toss in a new section like Past Officers, move the outdated info down there, and add the uptodate info.

Also, if there have been changes in policy that make it so old complaints should no longer apply, itd be fine to note that.  For example, In the past (optional: provide dates) there was criticism about X.  Taking those complaints into account, CalPIRG did Y in hopes of avoiding similar problems in the future.

The main concern here is preserving history.  Sometimes history includes problems.  That doesnt mean it cant be made clear that those problems no longer exist (if thats actually the case); they just shouldnt be deleted outright.  When a business or organization is responsive to criticism, it can actually be really good.  For example, I wrote about a problem with some fries sitting in at least 1/4 cup of oil at Uncle Vitos a while back.  Daubert Another editor got word to the manager that day and he said hed take steps to ensure it wouldnt happen again.  It was really gratifying. Users/TomGarberson

20120327 15:51:30 nbsp Also, Welcome to the Wiki! Users/TomGarberson

20120327 17:45:02 nbsp Hey, no worries... its a back and forth editing process, just like everything done with many people involved.  I note that you removed the bit about people being able to optout by going to the office.  Can people no longer optout of CalPRIG? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
