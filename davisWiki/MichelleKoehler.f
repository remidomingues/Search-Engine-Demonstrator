Michelle Koehler is a long time Davis resident. She graduated from Davis Senior High School in 2004 and went to the California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) and achieved a B.S in Sociology.

Michelle enjoys Davis immensely as an adult. The postgraduation world is far more interesting than the college world. Davis provides a rich atmosphere in which to challenge common preconceived notions and social norms. She finds that many of the residents are eager to participate in discussion of ideas and add previously unexplored perspectives. The community atmosphere in Davis is something Michelle finds unique to Davis and she enjoys thoroughly.

Her purpose for helping with the Wiki is to clarify and clear up misinformation. She welcomes questions and discussions of all sorts.

In her downtime, Michelle enjoys swimming and outdoor shenanigans.

Currently, she lives in Davis and works for UC Davis.
