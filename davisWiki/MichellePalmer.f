I might be a little too opinionated for my own good, but I also tend to give people plently benefit of the doubt.

I put my heart into everything I do. If youre going to look silly, you might as well do a damn good job at it.

Im 25 and a second year student, which makes me feel incredibly old among my classmates.
I didnt go to school after high school  I just lived the grownup life for 5 years aaand now Im here.

Ive got a bit of an interesting story, not something I broadcast but then again its not something that I wont share with you if you ask. So in lieu of asking me, you can read about it http://drvirginiasimpson.com/stories.html here.

Before moving to Davis from the Southern California desert, I worked as a vet tech.

I live in West Davis with my boyfriend users/mheathershaw Mark, Diego the Doberman, Xand Mrs. Socks, the lab mix that Ive had since 5th grade.X

I ride a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixedgear_bicycle fixie, but Im fairly certain that Ill never be able to trackstand or do fancy bike tricks. Not flying off again has been my best trick to date.

I can really appreciate a great vegetarian meal... Im a big fan of Raja Indian Cuisine. If you havent been there, GO!

The March 4, 2010 Public Education protest made me want to start working for the CHP.

Wells Fargo Home Mortgage nearly screwed me out of my home because of their horrible customer service and papershuffling, so I ran to the media. My 3 month long battle with them was solved in 15 minutes, on the day that the news crew filmed my story.

For that reason, I am a firm believer of making noise.

About 2 years ago, I took my truck to http://www.ezlube.com EZ Lube for an oil change where they proceeded to empty out my old oil and not replace it. They sent me on my merry way and I didnt get very far before my truck broke down. They denied it and gave me the runaround for months, until I took them to court over it. Jerks. The local news did a story on that one, too. http://www.youtube.com/user/MichelleyPS#p/a/u/0/PChOZUbgiGY Video! I moved to Davis because I ran out of local TV channels. Ha!

20091013 17:54:13 nbsp indeed! Likewise

why does diego look so serious in that photo ¬_¬ Users/StevenDaubert

20091014 18:19:24 nbsp is there any links to the news story pertaining to the mortgage shenanigans? Users/StevenDaubert

20100105 09:50:59 nbsp Well, I hope bringing anonymous users out of the woodwork isnt always a bad thing.  ;)  But I know what you mean.  Honestly, I think its just a function of being an active wiki editor and caring about the wiki.  Its worth the fight, I think.  Anyway, thanks for your comment  Im glad to know that others see the salon situation as I do. Users/CovertProfessor

20100203 00:52:36 nbsp Heh.  Thanks... I have to blow off frustration in some way, and humor works for me.  I do sleep, although I like working late evenings and/or early mornings and often take an afternoon nap.  Two short bits of sleep make it seem like Im on around the clock, but Im actually away from the computer quite a bit during the morning and evening (and I dont use my phone to check the wiki, ever!).  For instance, we had a dinner party earlier this evening, throwing dough and making pizzas.  Im sure that gap is in there.  I normally just pop on Recent Changes fairly often as I work (a cycle of email/RC/work queue) so it creates the illusion that Im always around.  Of course, right now Im neglecting the project in front of me I should be working on.  ...and Diego is awesome. Users/JabberWokky

20100203 01:32:48 nbsp The IRS is concerned with forprofit businesses using the wiki, a nonprofit, to profit. This gives us our one hard and fast rule: Any pricing involving a nonprofit is ok. So anything on SPCA thrift store is fine.

The other ok for adding prices is for educational purposes. If its educational, its ok. This includes prices on apartment listings.

What we want to avoid things that are promoting business. Straight price lists are not kosher on a page, although we can link to them. Posting the price of a buffet is probably ok.

The standard I have in my mind (and others may disagree) is that if it is the type of thing a business would write about themselves on a website, flier, or brochure, then it isnt ok. If its something members of the community without a commercial interest in the subject would write, then its fine. We should aim for this, anyway, without the IRS breathing down our necks. Alder Ridge Apartments is an example of a page with promotional material that needs to be cleaned up. Take a dip in the pool, relax in the hot tub, or enjoy a great game of tennis on the lighted tennis court. Thats straight out of a brochure, Id guess. Its not something a normal person would write.

So yeah... straight price list, nuke it from orbit. Users/WilliamLewis

20100203 01:46:10 nbsp I use a guideline of if it looks like something printed at OfficeMax and placed under your windshield wiper, it needs at the very least a hefty rewrite.  If you cant, it needs to not be an advertisement for the business.  Representative prices (the way newspaper articles list about a restaurant) are probably okay.  Again, these are my guidelines (which arent necessarily other peoples guidelines). It is admittedly fuzzy right now.  There is a discussion (with no real resolution) located wiki:wikispot:Community Guidelines/Business promotion questions/Talk here. Users/JabberWokky

20100203 22:11:31 nbsp Actually, I did not put everything together until your boyfriend made his own page and his name was not Diego. Users/hankim
