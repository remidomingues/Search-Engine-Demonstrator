20140315 19:30:19 nbsp I had the most wonderful haircut, color and highlights from Ms. Michelle White.  Not only is she engaging, friendly, enthusiastic and obviously has a passion for her craft, she is extremely talented.  I completely trusted her with choosing the best color for me and my results were truly magical.  I learned more about hair and the importance of using professional products and how to keep my hair healthy in one session from Michelle than I ever did in my lifetime.  Cobalt Salon truly has a gem in this salon and I will be coming back to see Michelle and I will be sending my friends and family to come see her.  Loved the experience!!
