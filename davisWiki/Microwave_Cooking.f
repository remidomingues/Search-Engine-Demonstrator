Many students at UC Davis are busy with class and simply dont have the time or energy to make an elaborate meal. Therefore, microwave meals are a popular option. Much of what passes as microwave cooking is actually reheating or thawingbut there are actually many foods that you can cook in the microwave that work pretty well.  And if youre on campus, you can do your cooking in one of several campus microwaves.

Note: Microwave heating times vary with each microwave.


 Meat 
 Bacon
    Place paper towel on plate, layer bacon on top, cover with another paper towel. Microwave ~1 1/2 minutes.
 Boneless Chicken Breast
    One Breast:  Cook 4.55.5 minutes on high.  Cover with a sauce (BBQ, etc.) first if you want to preserve more moisture.
       If frozen:  set to defrost, heat for 5 minutes.  Then cook as above.
 Eggs
    Scrambled
     Yogurt container method: crack an egg in to an old 34 inch diameter yogurt container. Beat with a little milk. Nuke 2 minutes. Voila, scrambled egg perfect for a bagel.
       Alternative containers:  small ceramic coffee mug.
    Overeasy
       Fork method: Use shallow ceramic or paper bowl. Spray bowl with Pam, or rub with butter (optional).  Crack egg into bowl.  Stab yolk with plastic fork, leaving fork inside the yolk.  (The biggest problem with cooking unscrambled eggs in the microwave is that the yolk explode.  This method keeps the yolk from leaking, but also lets it relieve pressure and thus not explode.) Cook on high for 4353 seconds (800watt) with the fork still within the yolk throughout cooking.
       Eggie Method: Walmart sells egg microwave devices called Eggies.  They are plastic egg shaped containers with a small hole at the top.  This allows the egg to explode without making a mess.  I recommend the fork method instead.

 Louisiana Hot Links
   Split in half lengthwise & microwave 23 minutes; veggies such as asparagus can be added, along with a sprinkling of Mrs. Dash (aka Molly McButters stepmom)... no addl water/oil needed.
 Frozen Meatballs
    Microwave 2 minutes... no addl spices/water/oil needed.

 Grains / Starches 
 Baked Potato
   Pierce the skin, wrap in paper towel, nuke for 8 minutes or until done. It wont be as fluffy as it normally would be.
 Yams/Sweet Potato
   Same directions as above, reduce cooking time to 56 minutes. Results are better than potato.

 Ramen
   Follow Directions on Container. Its recommended to boil the water separate from the ramen because it tends to overflow leaving a mess, and has an icky gummy texture.
 Mi Kho (Vietnamese Dry Noodles) Tastes better than the name, and less MSG since its drained off.
   12 Cups of Shrimp Cup Ramen cooked according to directions and drained of soup. (You can drink the soup on the side, my dad likes it this way.)
    2 teaspoon of Soy Sauce
    1/2 tablespoon of Lemon or Lime Juice (or more if you like it sour.)
    a pinch of pepper or hotsauce (or more depending on taste. Recommend: use the kind with the chicken on the bottle.)
    Combine all ingredients in a bowl and enjoy. Sip ramen soup on the side for lubrication.

 Minute Rice

 Regular Rice
   Place 2 cups long grain rice, 3 1/2 cups water or stock, 1 1/2 teaspoons butter or oil, in a large bowl. Microwave on high, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Microwave on medium, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice at any time during the cooking process. Season with salt and pepper and fluff with a fork.

 Vegetables 
 Artichokes / Broccoli
   Arrange plate of flowers, add a little water, cover with a paper towel, nuke 23 minutes
 Green beans (frozen or fresh)/Asparagus
   Submerge in water, heat for about 23 minutes, empty water, add olive oil and seasoning salt, heat for another 45 seconds.
 Corn on the Cob
     Place 4 ears of corn in dish with 1/4 cup water. Cover and microwave on High 6 to 8 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes and drain.
    Or wrap each ear in waxed paper, place on paper towel and microwave 2 to 3 minutes per ear. Corn can be microwaved without husking; be very careful when removing husk to avoid steam burns.
 Ranch Beans
    1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
    1 3/4 cups canned vegetarian baked beans
    1 3/4 cups canned red kidney beans, drained and rinsed

General Ideas

  Package a handful of frozen veggies in a disposable container with either a chicken breast, salmon, or some other meat and top it off with some seasonings. These are easy to make ahead of time and store in your freezer. Grab one on your way out the door, and by lunchtime its partially defrosted and ready to zap!

Caveats
  Be careful when using older microwave ovens which may not adequately protect you from exposure to microwaves.  Excessive microwave exposure can cause serious health problems, which is why the Soviets banned the use of microwaves in 1976.
  Do not heat milk in the microwave if you are giving it to a baby.  Because microwaves can heat unevenly, the milk can get very hot, even if it seems to be lukewarm.  Overheating can also change the chemical structure of the milk.
  Do not microwave metal unless you want to risk damaging your microwave, or the metal is included in a commercial microwavesafe product.  When metal is microwaved, it gets really hot and sparks, and, depending on the shape, may cause arcs of electricity.
  Do not microwave things in plastic dishes if you want to avoid toxins being released into you food.

A little bit of lemon / lime juice  tablespoon  in some water microwaved really helps cut the crud. When done right nastyness comes off with an easy swipe of a paper towel
