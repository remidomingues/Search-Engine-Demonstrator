Microwaves (unless youre talking about ovens... then look below) are high frequency electromagnetic waves in the 1 GHz to 1 THz (1000 GHz), or roughly 300mm (30cm) to 300Âµm (0.3mm), range. The microwave radio band is used for communications (cell phones, satellite, WiFi, microwave relay), cooking (microwave ovens), radar (weather, military), astronomy, medical applications (diathermy), manufacturing, and other uses. Newer cordless phones, WiFi, and microwave ovens share the same microwave band at approximately 2.4GHz, and can thus interfere with each other. The one military radar installation has been EPA Superfund Sites shut down, so that leaves communications and cooking in Davis. Talk and eat  kind of like the patios at Chipotle and Sudwerk.

Microwave communication towers need near line of sight (NLOS), so in a flat location like Davis, they are located around the edges of the city.  Inside the city, they tend to be part of Cell Phone Towers.
