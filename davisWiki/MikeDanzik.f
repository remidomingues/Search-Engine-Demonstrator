Howdy, Mike, and welcome to the Wiki!  The reason the Pet Pals entry is not in first person (We offer, Ask us, etc) is because anybody can edit the entry.  Since not all text on that entry will be from the actual owners of Pet Pals, its a good idea to keep everything third person.  If you look through other business entries on the wiki, youll notice they all use the same format. Users/JabberWokky jw
