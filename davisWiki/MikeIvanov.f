20100401 13:41:38 nbsp Thanks for compressing and transparentifying the logo.  That was contributed in jpeg, and I was running out the door to go pick up my wife from the airport (just got back from her first faculty position interview!), so all I had time for was a really quick imagemagick convert file.jpg file.png and upload.

20100617 17:58:52 nbsp Do you know of any place to get really hard wheels? Im talking 86a and above. Davis streets are vicious on soft wheels... Users/StevenDaubert

20100618 13:42:15 nbsp pretty sure disc is done for, and they mainly had an indoor focus iirc.

I checked online, and I couldnt find hard wheels. Perhaps I just fail Users/StevenDaubert

20100620 14:03:11 nbsp pretty sure its just your run of the mill 84 mm

89a ooooh purty <3 Users/StevenDaubert

20101004 17:06:17 nbsp Hey there! Im doing a project on local wikis for my english class. I was wondering how much material you provided to start this local wiki and make it so successful? For instance, did you provide names of local restaurants (or any other business for that matter) to let the locals comment on or did you just title the main pages and let the locals did the rest. Thanks, I look forward to hearing you. Users/ShelbyWunderle

20110412 17:25:22 nbsp Thanks so much! Users/RitchLudlow

20110507 18:33:35 nbsp Nice to have some Localwiki dev presence at the wiki!

20120615 21:12:05 nbsp I found a company called Labeda they make 92a durometery 80 mm asphalt wheels, I will report back

but its the hardest thing Ive found by FAR and hold high hopes Users/StevenDaubert

20140730 11:52:58 nbsp turns out the Labeda asphalt wheels are everything I could have hoped for & then some. Check them out if you dont mind super super dense wheels which are a tad slippery. Any negatives are completely offset by what I perceive to be the exceptional value & quality of this product.  Users/StevenDaubert
