Mike McClain enjoys helping his daughter cheat at Scrabble. Nothing else is known about him.



Hi Mike,
This page is your userpage, It is the one page on the wiki you have complete say over

the other page is for documenting your very public poker run, even to this day the Poker nuts on campus know who you are. Another wiki example would be former council member llamar heysteks public page, and then the page he used to edit the wiki. He is a public figure, and when you competed professional you were too. Mr. Shor has sifted your public page and removed your aunt/cousins/nephews heckling. Say hello to Chris for me and have a pleasant day. Daubert

P.S. if you have any questions dont hesitate to ask
