Working toward Zero Waste Zero Waste is my goal  Ive been Recycle Recycling stuff in Davis since 2004 with the now defunct R4 Recycling R4 Recycling Program the Campus Center for the Environment and Waste Busters
Waste Busters is an Event Support and Zero Waste consulting company I started here in Davis. We have been helping the Davis Farmers Market move toward Zero Waste, going from a 9% recycling rate to over 90% thanks to our program.

I graduated from UC Davis with a B.A. in International Relations focusing on the Environment, Populations and Resources.
I then rode my bike to Guatemala after learning about bike repair at the Bike Church.
I have worked for UC Davis as their Zero Waste Program Manager.
I love Whole Earth Festival and have been involved in various capacities over the years. I cant wait to rejoin the Karma Patrol.

20090401 13:41:53 nbsp Hello Mike, I received a friend request on FaceBook from a friend of yours.  She had mistakenly misspelled your last name, instead spelling it Seminitis.  I found the spelling between our names to be so close and assuming the pronunciation to be about the same I just had to get in contact with you.  Reason being, My family is very small.  To my knowledge my father, his brother and my grandfather and possibly my fathers uncle are the only ones who had the name.  Now there is myself, my three brothers and my nephew who will carry on the name.  I am very curious as to what your genealogy is.  I have always wondered since I am only third generation in this country if there is more to the story (Family Tree.)  Maybe they changed it on Ellis island when my family came over.  I am hoping you get this message and possibly have some info that could help me and my family out.  If not it is still cool knowing there is a guy with a name very similar to mine, especially after 27 years of being the only Mike Seminitis (Semihnyetiss) in the world.
Thanks, Mike Users/MichaelSeminitis

20110313 16:22:20 nbsp Mike, can you join the discussion on Yolo County Central Landfill/Talk?  There are some questions there about your recent edit. Users/CovertProfessor

20110313 16:44:21 nbsp The $350,000.00 was brought up at the Mar. o1, 2011 city council meeting. It is being debated whether the city should continue with this effort or not as it requires up to 5 years of research and fees of $350,000.00 just to begin, including EIRs. It was estimated at the meeting that fees could reach much higher than this as well.

As for the %. This was also mentioned as being the total amount of landfill space being used by the state of California in regards to plastic bags.

All of this should still be on record in the minutes of the Mar o1, 2o11 meeting. Users/WesP
