Mike can edit this to introduce themselves to the Davis community


Hey Mike  as a note, I removed the link you added to the Locally Oriented section of Locally Owned Websites because it doesnt seem to have greater Davis relevance: it seems to only be about the company, rather than being a Locally Oriented website.  Most (and in theory all) of those links are websites about Davis or providing free information for locals (like the Redbarn gardening blog).  I poked around the website before I did so, but maybe I missed something focused locally.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
