20061115 16:48:15 nbsp After getting fleeced by Midas in Woodland (on an 87 Civic of all cars), I gave Mike Argos garage a chance and from then on dont go anywhere else.  For all the neardeaths my car has been through, Mike has always managed to revive it on the cheap  hes really running a car clinic.  Mike and Rick are superfriendly and always make time to explain the ins and outs of the car, taking the full vehicle history into account.  I recommended him to several of my Hondaowning friends and all of them have stuck with him for car repair as well.  I just wish Mike would bend his Honda/Subaruonly rule and take my wifes Nissan Sentra when its having problems.   Users/VivekMathrani

20070109 18:33:28 nbsp I only had some minor work done so I cant really comment on their pricing, but I think I learned more about my car from a few minutes with Mike than from the workers at every other car repair place Ive been to combined. Users/AndrewChen

20070801 16:25:59 nbsp I went by this place today and the inside was completely abandoned looking with the doors locked and no posted hours.  The phone number is disconnected too, so I think this place might be closed for good. Users/BenJohnson

20071025 10:28:40 nbsp Sadly, Mike Argos closed over the summer  I talked to Mike in the July timeframe (if I remember correctly), and due to personal reasons he had to close down the shop.  I will definitely miss him, Rick, and the car clinic, both for their quality work and helpful explanations.  Anyone have tips on a good alternate place to take Hondas for service? Users/markspiller
