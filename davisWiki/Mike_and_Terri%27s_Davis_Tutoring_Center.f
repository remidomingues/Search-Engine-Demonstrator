Mike and Terris Davis Tutoring Center is located near downtown Davis.  The tutors, Mike Leonard, PhD, and Terri Leonard, MD, have 30 years of combined experience tutoring full time with hundreds of students from Davis and surrounding communities.ï»¿  They tutor math, science, English, and Spanish for grades 7 through college.  They also offer assistance with SAT preparation and college counseling for all their students.  They were formerly known as Academic Improvement Center.

Both Mike and Terri tutor math, science, Spanish, and English, which means that students do not have a subjectspecific tutor.  Rather, a student can get help with his AP physics homework, his English essay, his AP Spanish homework, and prepare for his calculus test all in the same hour.

Additionally, because they have a tutoring center (rather than meeting students in their homes), their students are encouraged to come to their office at any time to use their resources.  Many of their students spend several hours a day at their center.

Free tutoring hours are available to their students.  When a student cancels his regularly scheduled tutoring session, any of their other students may dropin during that time at no additional charge.  This is a very popular feature of their tutoring center.

Because they have tutored in Davis since 1997, they are very familiar with the classes and teachers in the Davis school district.

Their students vary widely in academic ability and motivation, and their tutoring is individualized to meet the specific needs of each student.

They require no enrollment fees or longterm contracts.
