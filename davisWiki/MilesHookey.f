Originally from deepest darkest http://www.ci.santacruz.ca.us/ Santa Cruz, California, Im a double major Political Science and History (major) History student. Ive been at UC Davis since transferring in late 2003.

Since coming to Davis, Ive had the wonderful experience of hearing http://mileshookey.typepad.com/another_coffee_cup/2004/11/aftermath_inc.html a person being murdered at my apartment complex. In South Davis, of all places...

Recently I was sworn in as a member of the ASUCD Senates Textbook Affordability Special Committee

I also have http://mileshookey.typepad.com my own weblog that I try to update every so often.

And I like coffee. And travelling. And girls. And Britpop. And sleeping. Cant forget that.

Bon Temps.   Stats(MilesHookey)
