 Winter 2013 Candidate Statement 

Hello, my name is Miles Thomas and I am running for ASUCD Senate on the BEST slate to serve you in student government. I’m the fourth year Managerial Economics major who defeated room reservation fees with the help of KDVS General Manager Renner Burkle and over 70 other club leaders. Imagine what I can accomplish with your vote.

Experience:
   Maxwell Kappes Senator Kappes Campaign Manager and Current Chief of Staff
  Davis Anime Club, President
  League of Campus Organizations  LOCO, President and Founder
  Student Political Action Committee, CoPresident
  DAiCon Chair
  BEST Slate CoFounder
  SMART, Campaign Manager (Fall 2012)
  Outreach Assembly Member (2012)

Class Units for Student Leaders
Some of the greatest moments in education on this campus have occurred not in classes, but in the leadership opportunities of the more than 500 undergraduate clubs. These organizations provide so much value to our campus, but they also require an incredible amount of labor and love. I believe that student leaders who are willing to demonstrate what they have gained in their roles should earn units for their service.

I am working with the Center for Student Involvement and the College of Education to give student leaders the credit they deserve. Serving on an executive board is a cocurricular activity, and should be viewed by potential employers alongside classes. This program would provide transcript notation and an extra incentive for students to put their all into the many groups that define our campus culture.

Accountability at all levels of Government
UC WIDE
Currently, the UC Regents invest millions of your fees into fossil fuels, yet we claim to be leaders in clean and forwardthinking technology. If elected, I will work with other UC student governments to ensure that we put our money where our mouth is, and use the Regent’s General Endowment to support progressive and local industries instead.

UC DAVIS
At the UC Davis level, I want more students in Mrak Hall. Any decision to shift the spending of student fees deserves student input, and I will work with the Student Assistants to the Chancellor and highlevel administrators as a senator to ensure that our voices are heard.

ASUCD
At the student government level, I will work with all voices in ASUCD. Specifically, I want to establish permanent relationships between ASUCD and the Engineering Joint Council, the SCC student directors, the dorm leadership counsels, student assistants to the chancellor, the interfaith community, and many more to ensure that student government represents and serves all students.

So when you vote on February 19th  22nd, vote for Miles Thomas for ASUCD Senate #1 and BEST for the REST, with Paul Min and Sergio Cano for President and VP. Thanks!



20130218 19:40:42 nbsp If youre elected, will BEST rename the ASUCD Senate into the UC Davis Maximum AuthorityWielding Best Student Senate? Users/BrentLaabs

20130318 16:46:06 nbsp Regarding my changes to your edit on the slate page: I wouldnt be so quick to declare that Independents can no longer be elected to the Senate or that there is a new paradigm of elections based upon one unique election. The only other time there have been three slates on the ballot in an ASUCD Senate election with Choice Voting was in Winter 2005 when 8 seats were open and there were much stronger Independent candidates than Winter 2013 had. If the next election or two show Independents continuing to lose you may be able to make a case against Independents being able to win elections. However, it remains to be seen whether the Winter 2013 election will be the start of a change or will be an outlier. Users/JonathonLeathers

20130318 18:12:49 nbsp Jonathon,

Its a trend thats been waiting to happen.  While I think its fair that its too early to state it as fact, this paradigm is real.  The election has moved away from analog tactics like flyers, canvassing, hitting up the ARC and library at night, etc, and has found a new home on Facebook and in classroom presentations organized by the various arms of campaigns.  Feel free to remove my analysis on the slate page, but Im confident Ill revert it after the Fall 2013 election. Users/MilesThomas

20130318 20:49:28 nbsp Those things you mentioned as not being effective were not effective when I was there either. And Facebook as well as classroom and club presentations have been around and used since I was there as well. None of what you are mentioning is new or even a new trend. Also, none of those things have any impact on being an Independent or on a slate. Users/JonathonLeathers

20130320 02:47:25 nbsp Slates dont run people who know what ASUCD is anymore, they run popular people.  Popular people have 2000 facebook friends.  Popular people get obscene numbers of votes without lifting a finger.

Qualified people dont generally have those things and thus dont bother running.  The ones who do can flyer all they want, but it can never make up the gap.
I think that is what Miles is saying.  Ive had this theory for a while, but until the election results came in even Miles thought I was full of shit. Users/MaxwellKappes

20130422 13:50:46 nbsp Basing your popularity statistics on raw number of Facebook friends will more often than not generate a mound of noise. The variable that consistently proves to have some influence is the number of Facebook friends that go to Davis and are currently enrolled as undergraduates; alumni might play a role as outlier cases at most.
