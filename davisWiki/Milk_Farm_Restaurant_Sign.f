The Milk Farm Restaurant signs sign can be seen from Interstate 80 in Dixon, when approaching Davis.  It is often a welcome sign to see for weary student adventures travelers when they are just about to nod off during the drive back home.

The signs sign features a snazzy logo with a cartoon cow jumping over a moon.  It can be seen on the west side of 80, just north of the Currey Road/First Street exit in Dixon (the same exit for downtown Dixon).  Like the picturesque Water Towers Davis water towers, the Milk Farm Restaurant cow is highly characteristic of our beloved town, and indicates theres only a few more miles to drive to get to Davis.

Karl A. Hess opened the Milk Farm in 1919, and moved it to its present (now abandoned) location in 1939. During the Great Depression people found entertainment at the Milk Farm with allyoucandrink milk for only 10 cents, often drinking themselves sick while attempting to outchug each other and secure a place on the board of honor.

The Milk Farm building itself was demolished several years ago. However, the sign will most likely be saved due to its http://www.milkfarm.net/sec4.pdf historical value.

 




The westbound sign above demonstrates how it rests inside the curve of the offramp from I80.

When the restaurant was torn down, everyone protested because the sign had been such a landmark, so it was agreed that the sign would stay (though its looking a big shopworn these days and it wouldnt surprise me if it was eventually taken down).  I ate there once.  Good place.  Kind of an upscale Dennys quality. Users/BevSykes

20050319 16:01:59 nbsp I am fascinated that the restaurant had been there so long!  Its a pity they tore it down.  I look at the sign everytime I leave/return to Davis and have always wondered the story of the restaurant.  Thanks for all the info! Users/KayRide

20080801 23:52:43 nbsp When I was a kid, (and when the actual restaurant still existed), there was another cow jumping the moon mounted on top of the building itself.  It was neon and had a mechanized tail that waved up and down.  And at 6 years old, it was absolute magic.  So sad its gone.   Users/jefftolentino

20100531 20:40:44 nbsp I just found a dinner plate at a flea market with the Cow and Moon logo. Boy oh Boy was I thrilled! Our family had never had a meal there, but the sign was a milestone for us on our way up to Tahoe.  When I read that peoples lives were so intertwined with the sign, I could understand. Im happy to have my own little piece in way of the plate. Any recent news about the sign would be appreciated. Users/Dalia
