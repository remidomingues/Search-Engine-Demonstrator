If youve ever seen impertinent but friendly students sitting at tables in between the Quad and MU, yelling at passersby about free milk and cookies, youve probably seen Nicholas Barry (the founder) and his band of merry men and women.  Every finals session they set up with tasty cookies, brownies, and muffins, along with a generous serving of milk (in a Dixie cup).  Everything is free.  Although many insist they are slightly insane, they maintain that they are doing it for goodwill, happiness, and stress relief.  (In a rare moment of honesty, Nicholas admitted that since Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for raising awareness about global warming, surely Nicholas could win for giving out free milk and cookies.)  Whatever their motives, many students welcome the free snacks, even if they dont actually result in the 15% increase in finals grades that their purveyors guarantee.

If you want to catch a bite, youll find it between 11:00am and 2:00pm on a day with finals.  The group used to set up a table from 10:00 to 2:00, but found that the traffic was too low to justify it. Sometimes if you come too late, the cookies might be already gone!

You can often find vegan options here in the form of vegan cookies and soy milk.

Its should also be noted that while milk and cookies is doing this for free, giving us cool stickers is awesome and scores super extra finals karma.  Not required, but who doesnt love giving someone stickers anyway.  Bring some stickers!

The group loves people to partake in their snacks, but they are also looking out for helpers of all kinds.  Nicholas has asked that you contact him (415 250 7305, or Mailto(nicholas AT barryscientific DOT com)) if you want to help.  Usually helpers are asked to help attend a table, bring cookies or milk, or help put together a poster.

Recently (as of January 2008), the group evolved a bit.  The most active members felt that one activity a quarter wasnt quite enough fun for them.  Also, they had the sneaking suspicion that everyone else forgot about the groups existence during the intervening period, and all the groups expensive ad campaigns would have to be created anew each quarter.  So the group decided to host weekly events, collectively called Wild Weekly, such as pillow fights, free hugs, scavenger hunts and costume days.  Event information is frequently posted on the facebook group (linked above, in the contact information), and sometimes makes it onto the Davis Wiki events page (when the M+C crowd are feeling particularly organized).  Although most of the events take place on the UC Davis campus, the sources close to the higherups in the organization assure us that all are welcome, and perhaps even encouraged, to participate.
