Minh Tran lives in the house known by most as the United U.N (yes, thats united united nations :P) She collects dutch roommates by the dozen. But also likes any foreign exchange student needing a place to stay.
Her house claim to fame is having the no parking sign that is stuck into the tree than removed on E. 8th street.

She can be caught at G Street Pub G street ordering the cheapest pitcher of beeeeeeer with her roomies on most friday nights.

blah blah blah

update

I no longer collect dutch roomies but actually moved to collecting Brazilian roomies instead :P.
G Street Pub love has gone...although i might hang around on karaoke night so I can hear rich sing jesses girl ^_^
