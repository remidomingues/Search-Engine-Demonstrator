Minibins are provided by R4 Recycling as a trash receptacle on campus. They consist of one large  bin for paper, and a small clip on bin for trash. These are commonly misused by freshman new to UC Davis because they use both for trash. They are found in Segundo and Tercero. Cuarto and Tercero South have Apartment Sorters. Minibins are problematic because there is no area for cans and bottles, but you can set up another bag next to your minibins.
