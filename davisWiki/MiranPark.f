20080502 21:16:39 nbsp The CLIMB program was the best decision I ever made. In fact i loved it so much that I am going to graduate school in applied math (focusing on ecology) at Cornell. If it were not for CLIMB I would not even be going to grad school. Unlike most research programs you will be exposed to a bunch of topics and be able to define your own project. I see you like physics, which can serve you well, one of the topics you may cover (veries from year to year) is biofluids and using mathematical physics to model fish feeding or blood flow. The program in intense but it is really rewarding. I think you will really like it. In fact i liked it so much I am a mentor for this years group. Users/MattHh

20080504 22:24:29 nbsp its a big time commitment. You dont want to be doing more than 12 units outside of CLIMB per quarter, you may be able to pull off a little extra (either units/job/research/extra curricular) but it will take up about as much time as your most time consuming class.

20081120 14:50:31 nbsp I envy you right now. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081125 15:41:07 nbsp Because of your involvement with CLIMB.

p.s. Actually, that is my next book.  I loved Neverwhere so much that I decided to read all of Gaimans stuff starting with American Gods. So, thanks! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081126 13:57:24 nbsp Heh, thanks for the recommendations, and no I didnt intend on watching the movie Stardust as per other peoples reviews of it as well.  Actually, I know all about Gaiman, but only now just getting to him.  I work at The Avid Reader bookstore, so Im pretty much in the know about every author.  Swing by if you ever wanna talk books.

20081126 15:06:03 nbsp And no, I never got into CLIMB.  Hence, the envy. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090908 20:26:57 nbsp Thanks for your comment. Check out http://espressomap.com/ for recommended cafes in North America. Try Temple in Sac for the closest one. They put a little too much milk in their cappuccinos compared to blue bottle, ritual, four barrel, haus, barefoot, etc, but they are lightyears ahead of any cafe in Davis. Im a Gaiman fan as well. I think vegan asian panda is redundant. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20100720 17:45:16 nbsp Thats a pretty awesome looking shot, how many sink shots did it take you to get a decent shot? I do have a very lowend espresso machine and a Macap M4. Its true, its actually pretty easy to pull shots that are much better than anywhere else in Davis. This is probably because every cafe in Davis starts with bad or mediocre beans.
