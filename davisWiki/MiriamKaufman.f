Miriam is very nice. And stinky. And she never yells at me for calling her Wombaticus, a name remarkable for its stupidity. :)  Users/SummerSong

20050614 15:50:41 nbsp Poot is being such a hellraiser today.  She has knocked over; a water glass onto my desk; everything off my windowsill; a stack of papers; three books; and a picture frame.  After a few quick runs around my bedroom and some anklebiting, she is now sitting on my shoulder, meowing pitously.  And shes purring, too!  What a little stinker.  I <3 Poot! Users/SummerSong

20060220 20:27:09 nbsp Thanks, Miriam. To get the fire, I had to deactivate the flash, which meant holding the camera steady. The previous two were blurry for that reason.
