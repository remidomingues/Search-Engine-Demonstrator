Mishkas Cafe Coffees, Teas & Roastery was founded in 1995 by UC Davis graduate student Sinisa Novakovic (whose name is pronounced more like Sineesha, and who bears more than just a passing resemblance to Morrissey) and his former wife, Bobbi Bohart and is named after one of Sinisas cats.  It is a Cafes café founded in the Old World tradition: a cozy place to meet a friend, converse, read, and relax.  Mishkas is home to one of the three coffee roasters in Davis (Cloud Forest Cafe and The Pepper Peddler are the others). Mishkas usually refers to the town, in jest, as PRD The Peoples Republic of Davis), and they serve only organic and fair trade beans. Mishkas buys only Fair Trade Organic beans and roasts them inhouse to create coffee that is considered one of the best in town. Overall, the café has a warm and earthy atmosphere due to the orange walls, wood furniture, black accents, and soft lights.

They serve cappuccino, espresso and all the other usual coffee drinks. Try one of Mishkas signature drinks, the Dark Balkan Night  a 16 oz. triple shot mocha! They have also, began serving fresh whipped cream again, rather than a brand name, canned whipped cream. Make sure to order whipped cream, if desired, while at the register, because there is a small charge and it is a hassle to pay for it after youve already paid for your drink if you forgot to tell the cashier in the first place.

In addition to drinks, Mishkas also has a nice selection of Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods pastries and candy confections such as croissants, macaroons, baklava, and chocolate truffles. When purchasing pastries, inspect carefully to see if they have been sitting out for a long time, as they do get dried out after a while if no one has ordered much lately. If you do receive a dried out or otherwise distasteful pastry, you can take it back (provided you havent eaten half of it already) and ask for a different item. Many might consider the truffles to be the best in town, better than the ones at Ciocolat, a chocolatedessertcentered business. The truffles are made by a local outfit called Vevey Confections. You can also find them at Common Grounds.

Mishkas has WiFi Hot Spots wireless access.  Access used to be free/unlimited, but now you have to ask for an access code and password when you make a purchase. Each purchase earns you 2 hours of internet. Sometimes the modem/router needs to be reset.  Mishkas regulars include undergraduates, grad students graduate/professional students, professors, and business people. Mishkas has a high proportion of laptopusing customers, and outlets are plentiful (although they can be tricky to find, since most of them are hidden under the back edge of the tables lining the walls).

Beware if you are short on cash: Mishkas has now started accepting credit cards, however, the menu prices are the cash discounted prices, and are 20 cents lower than the full price paid with a card. The nearest ATM is down 2nd Street a block west at the Golden 1 Credit Union  on the corner of D Street.

The music selection at Mishkas has grown over the years, from a rather limited playlist (consisting of Manu Chau, the Amelie soundtrack, Buena Vista Social Club, Gypsy Kings, etc) to over 5400 songs consisting of 400500 various artists as of September 2012. The music list is set to shuffle by album at random.
Mishkas claims that every corner of the Mother Earth is represented in the selection.

Here are some general tips for finding the right time to study at Mishkas: it seems to be quieter during the day and gets progressively louder at night. Some find focus impossible when the coffee roaster is running (Tuesday mornings), while others welcome a droning background noise to drown out chatter (which is less often a problem at Mishkas, per the etiquette below). If you are more sensitive to noise levels and wouldnt deign to use an iPod or earplugs, shuffling around until you settle on a more quiet spot can sometimes be difficult.

 The following view, it should be noted, is not held by everyone, and although nonstudents rarely flout Mishkas unstated etiquette, the interplay between the initiated and uninitiated can sometimes lead to unnecessary conflict. So, when frustrated by distracting neighbors who fail to understand that their voices carry beyond the narrow radius of their chairs, do be kind in manner towards them, for they may not understand that there is, or ought to be, any etiquette peculiar to Mishkas. 

Unspoken, unofficial etiquette for students: after spending significant time at Mishkas, students develop a tacitly shared studentspecific etiquette, an understanding that, unlike many cafés where talking without concern for distracting ones neighbors may be winced at but accepted all the same, Mishkas is an exception. Because this venue is primarily frequented by researchers of all sorts, predominantly graduate students, a premium is placed on quiescence for the sake of studious focus. Implicit acceptance of this etiquette is seen whenever cellular calls or quiet conversations that rise to a distracting pitch are, out of politeness, moved outside. Chatting boisterously with a friend is a happy sight at Mishkas, where studiousness more often reigns, but if one wishes to remain mindful of the (unofficial) etiquette adopted by students, the front room or the tables outside are viewed as more appropriate locales for highvolume chatter.



The Rule


The Rule explained: Mishkas is such a popular studying place that by the late nineties it became impossible for casual cafegoers to find a table.  In response, Mishkas management declared some tables studyfree zones.  Attached only to the tables at the front of the café is The Rule.  Nowadays theres almost always a place to sit and flip through the days http://www.sfchron.com San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.nytimes.com New York Times, http://www.sacbee.com Sacramento Bee, or The California Aggie California Aggie.  As of the summer of 2005, The Rule had been updated to be much funnier and fluffier, but retained the same meaning.  Additionally, some time in 2005 they constructed a bench to divide the studying section and the casual section of the cafe.

Many customers are flustered about the rule.  The rule prohibits laptops and studying, complete with piles of books, binders and highlighters. It welcomes newspapers, magazines, bookreading, game playing and friendly conversation.  Basically if you are hiding in your laptop or are cramming for a midterm, go sit in the back.


The Move

In early 2011, Mishkas moved to a new, solar powered, greener location. The previous location (514 2nd St. #B) is now occupied by a seafood restaurant called the Dot Island Grill.
Mishkas is powered by 41 highefficiency solar panels. Virtually all of the lightbulbs in the cafe are LEDs. The walls of the new building were constructed following the principles of http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi001theperfectwall The Perfect Wall.

One of the very few places that I could go and stay for more than 23 hours studying, writing reports, papers, thesis,... very effectively since almost all surrounding people are also doing the same thing. More importantly customers used to have access to wifi for as long as they could stay. However, just very recently they changed their policy to issue wireless password for 2 hours per purchase, which is sort of not very pleasant at least for someone like me. Perhaps, I start moving to other places to do my school work such as Peets.

20100124 15:17:58 nbsp Good coffee, came in to study found a oneperson table and have been sitting here for a few hours now. Lots of people, but studiers are coming and going so its only a matter of a few minutes to find a seat in the back, or as I saw today twice, a person moved to a oneseater to allow groups of people to find a seat. Nice vibe, a little noisy due to the constant clientele, the studiers and just the front people having a nice chat over a cup of coffee.
The employees are indeed busy but help you courteously. Recommendable place.

Its true, there isnt much place infront for those on the lookout for a cup of coffee and a newspaper, but there is seating outside as well. Users/elliotgoethe

20100203 18:39:07 nbsp I have a cyclical relationship with Mishkas.  When I get tired of my office or working from home, I often set up shop at Mishkas because they are locally owned, have great coffee, often play good music, and have a great WiFi connection.  When Im feeling guilty about spending too much money on my tripleshot mochas (without a doubt, the best and most consistent mocha in town), I give up my seat amongst the other macusing cool kids and head back to the office for a couple of weeks.  For those of you who complain about the service, the patrons or The Rule, I have a few words for you.

Service: if youre polite to the staff, theyll be polite to you... but seriously, dont expect Starbucksstyle fake smiles and carefully scripted greetings. You shouldnt want that, and nobody should be forced to behave that way... its unnatural behavior in a coffee shop.  I think the staff is, generally speaking, fantastic.

Other patrons: Dont be afraid of the macusing cool kids.  If you think that more room could be made for another chair, OR youd like to share a table, OR youd like to wrap your charger cord under another table, around someones leg and over another persons shoulder, WELL, in my experience if you just ask a direct question with a please and a polite smile, youll probably get what you want.  Often, just an excuse me, proper hand gesture and a smile will work as well. People want to spread out, but they will share if you ask.  On the other hand, if an obnoxious smelly person likes to talk loudly on the phone in the midst of a bunch of quiet productive people, Ill support you if you ask them to please take it outside.

The Rule: is perfect.

Go to Mishkas and support one of the places that makes The Peoples Republic of Davis. Users/KemblePope

20100203 18:54:19 nbsp The last time I was here and used the wireless internet, someone with Windows seemed to have wiki:WikiPedia:Internet Connection Sharing turned on and was advertising itself as an IPv6 router without any global prefix, so it was very useless. There seemed to be 12 other computers, mostly Apple, also (not) using IPv6. Its not Mishkas fault because they dont control customers broken computers, but it was kind of annoying and also interesting to see how IPv6 is starting to appear but not work all the time. Hopefully Mishkas will get proper IPv6 soon and the user with Windows will manage to turn off ICS. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100323 10:27:17 nbsp Mishkas coffee is THE BEST! My husband and I are frequent visitors.  When we are not drinking the coffee there, we are brewing it at home.  I buy beans on Tuesdays after they are roasted.  The staff is super friendly; Desiree know our names and our order.  It is a cozy and inviting environment and one of my favorite things about Davis. Users/MandyButler

20100323 10:27:59 nbsp When I was a sophomore in college, my bigbig sis in my sorority who had already graduated and was then working on her masters took me out to dinner downtown and we passed by this curious little cafe on our journey to the dinner destination. In those days, I didnt care much about studying but she said to me, if you need a place to study where you wont know many people who will distract you, go to Mishkas Cafe. Its full of graduating seniors and grad students serious about getting their work done.

I didnt visit Mishkas till my 4th year in Davis. Yes, that was when I decided to start getting SERIOUS about graduating. Thats when I began to spend countless days at Mishkas writing essays, reading books, studying, or just escaping from the craziness of the world outside of my now FAVORITE cafe in Davis. The atmosphere Mishkas offers is most conducive to studying, I have found. There is free hispeed wifi, unlike other places where signal is shit and/or you would need to pay for wifi. I would choose to study at Mishkas over studying at the library, home or any other place in Davis any day! And in terms of coffee breaks or little coffee dates, Mishkas is the best place to go because they reserve a small area where no laptops are allowed, the section is for good ol reading or having a talk over a cup of coffee. They also seem to have great taste in the music they play.

Im a fan of teas, and Mishkas has a variety of green, black and white teas. My favorite is the genmaicha, also known as the Tea of Inquiry. It combines green tea with toasted rice, producing a very tranquil tea experience. This or coffee, paired with a good book, a homework assignment and the environment of Mishkas  A+ grade in your classes.

Im now a graduate of UC Davis. I think I owe this to you, Mishkas Cafe!!!! I love you Mishka, whoever you are!!!!! Thanks for opening up your cafe!!! :) Users/AnniieRose

20100323 10:53:39 nbsp I heard from somewhere that Mishkas cafe has a list of people who have met there and gotten married. Super interesting. Does anyone know if this list really exists and if public, where I can find it?  Users/AnniieRose

20100508 00:33:09 nbsp I enjoy studying at Mishkas. For some reason I find it better than Shields library, probably because theres just a nice drone of regular talk that evens out after awhile, and people are actually serious about working. They have great tea and the little chocolatecovered espresso bean you get with hot drinks rock. I find that the rudeness factor depends on the day. Sometimes the staff can be quite rude, except for the brownstraighthaired girl who is always super cheerful and sweet. Once they were out of scones and she offered to make a new batch! Ive had some bad experiences with the others, nothing extreme but I just get the feeling theyd rather not be there, or theyd rather I not be there. I dont need them to be saccharin sweet, but Ive been ignored a number of times after asking a direct question, and it really wouldnt hurt to crack a smile every once in awhile. I asked for an espresso bean once because I got an iced coffee drink... the sweet girl smiled and said Sure, no problem! The next time I asked, someone else, I was told in a sharp voice, You know, we dont give espresso beans with cold drinks and she handed it to me as though she were doing me a favor. The students that study there are also inbetween. Sometimes students will leave their stuff scattered all over two tables on a busy day and go and get lunch or take a walkwho knows, except for more than 1/2 hour their stuff sits there while other people who want to study are s.o.l. This isnt Mishkas fault but the students, of course. But Id rather end on a positive note because I really do love this café. Overall theyve got good coffee, I love the fact that its served in ceramic cups if its forhere and Ive seen The Rule handled very politely each time someone unknowingly sat there. Users/lunelectronique

20100511 11:24:24 nbsp Ive returned here a few times since my first visit because they make a decent soy latte.  The atmosphere is also more conducive to studying than, say, starbucks.  But after an unfortunate encounter with the customer service they have to offer at this establishment, I will seriously reconsider coming back here any time soon.  And yes, this does concern the absurd RULE.

Why this cafe blatantly discriminates amongst its different types of patrons is truly beyond me.  Why should I essentially be refused a place to sit when I pay the same $3.30 for my latte as a nonstudent?  A note to Mishkas management: You operate your business in a UNIVERSITYcentered community.  Turning away paying student customers, to anyone with a basic understanding of economics, is an IDIOTIC mistake.  And not only that, but the staff is incredibly rude about it.

Yes, I was sitting in the studyfree zone.  Yes, i was on my laptop.  But there were absolutely NO seats in the student section, whereas EVERY SINGLE seat in the front of the cafe was open.  When the barista rudely approached me and told me that I needed to relocate immediately, I easily explained that I was waiting for a seat in the student section to open up.  I had made the mistake of assuming this individual had a soul.  Wrong.  She told me, and I quote, There are plenty of spaces available; youll just have to tell someone to move.  Otherwise, youll have to leave.  Honestly?  I mean, really?  This is what I get for trying to support local businesses?

I know I am hardly the only person to have experienced this ridiculous treatment at the hands of the intolerable staff.  I urge you to reconsider your choice of Mishkas, a busniess that has honestly lost sight of how paying customers deserve to be treated.    Users/ElaineK

20100611 10:42:30 nbsp In my opinion Mishkas has the best coffee in town. However, its a shame that Mishkas Cafe has turned out to be a study lounge for students. Every time I walk into their place there is no where to sit besides The Rule tables, which in my opinion they should switch the NonRule tables to Rule tables and the Rule tables to NonRule tables. First and foremost its a CAFE! NOT a lounge for smug ass students writing their worthless papers on meaningless topics that contribute nothing to humanity. Its ridiculous how some people justify being there for 5+ hours. Its fortunate that their coffee is so good or else there would be no reason t return, unless your a douche of course.    Users/MarioM

20100624 11:17:11 nbsp I had a latte and a slice of cake, of some kind.  Latte was extremely watered down and the cake was completely solid in the middle (frozen, I presume).  Not good at all.  Only visit, last visit. Users/advogt

20101029 14:25:27 nbsp Mishkas is more than a cafe´, it is an international experience!

Unfortunately, I stayed away from Mishkas my first couple of years in Davis.  The large orange sign did not attract me as much as the name brand coffee shops in town.  Boy, did I miss out.  One day, on a whim, I thought that I would give Mishkas a try.  I was first impressed by the international feel of the cafe´.  From the rustic decor, to the music playing, to the worn in (could have been here for 100 years) character, Mishkas to me is an excursion to anywhere in Europe, South America, and beyond.  Beyond the ambience, the service is fantastic.  More often than not, the baristas are friendly, knowledgeable, and obviously take pride in what they do.  I believe that is a reflection of the owner.  I love his in and out presence.  He will drop in and out to see how things are going.  He is not just in this to make money, it is clear that he has a vision for providing the best coffee and teas, along with adding culture to the Peoples Republic of Davis.  Mishkas is a Davis landmark.  The new location is about to open soon, and I am excited and anxious.  I am excited because it will be much bigger (sometimes it is hard to find a seat).  I am anxious because I hope that it does not lose any of its old world charm.  It seems that Mishkas attracts students (and onstudents) from all over the world.  There is not a day that I do not here at least two or three nonEnglish languages spoken in the store.  Is is special and unique, even for an international town like Davis.  I wish the best for the future of Mishkas!   Users/JonPage

20101113 23:06:03 nbsp I was in Davis for a visit today and dropped by Mishka for coffee. I noticed near the sugar/milk station area they have a sign saying they are moving in January to a new location near the Varsity Theater. Also posted was a floor plan for the new location. It will be 2 stories and have a balcony as well.  Users/SimonFung

20101205 11:06:52 nbsp Ive lived in Davis for 9 years and come to Mishkas every once and a while to work. What I love about Mishkas is the interior design, art on the wall, many outlets and tables, and the music  a lot of jazz and world music. But often when I come, I get a little irritated with the prices and sometimes the people who work here. I just paid $2.95 for a medium hot chocolate and that includes an extra .25 for the whip cream. Even in todays economy that seems a little petty and steep especially for a thriving cafe. Fortunately I usually dont order hot chocolates. The other issue is the people who work here. Over the last nine years there have been some very nice people working here but Ive also experienced people, like the two women today, who come off as a little snotty. Makes me wonder if they enjoy working here and if the owner treats them well. So for me, coming to Mishkas is sometimes a mixed bag. Users/TomHinds

20110325 14:04:29 nbsp The new location is really great. I like to stop in and have a tea and am a huge fan of the rule because I can usually find a seat up front for a quick 20 minute break near the window. The tea selection is great and the choice of mugs to serve it in is really nice.  I was hoping the upper deck would be part of Mishkas for outdoor seating, but I guess it will be used for another purpose. Oh well still a great place to get a tea.  Users/LucyB

20110516 19:07:44 nbsp There really should be a rule against saving extra seats for your friends  especially when they arent even at Mishkas.  I spied two open seats in the corner and bought a coffee, assuming the seats were available.  After I made my way over and tried to put my bag down, the student next to me shoved her bag in and said she was saving the seats for her friends, but that she wasnt sure if they were even going to show up at all.  I ended up taking my coffee to go because there were no seats left.  The place is already ridiculously crowded without imaginary customers sitting there. Users/DanAlcantara

20110907 07:32:44 nbsp I used to love Mishkas. The environment was great, the baristas were relaxed and friendly, and they could make one mean mocha. However, since theyve moved to the new location Ive visited about 5 times, and each time has been a bad experience. The coffee doesnt seem as good (The mochas have declined in quality for sure), the new location does not seem as friendly and welcoming as the old, and worst of all, the baristas! These girls need a huge lesson in customer service...they barely greet you, just stare at you and wait for your order, they will roll their eyes right in front of a customer, try to rush you through your order without answering any questions, and are not helpful at all about helping you find a lid or napkin or whatever else you might need. The final straw was this past week. My boyfriend wanted to stop in and get a coffee, so I went in with him. The experience was pretty typical of Mishkas lately, and as we were walking away we discovered his Mishkachinno (Mishkas version of a frappuchino from Starbucks, or a spinner from Barista) tasted like it was made out of a mix and not stirred right. It was powdery and gritty. We went to ask for a refund, which in my experience, coffee shops are always more than happy to provide. The barista at the counter said that she didnt think she could do refunds, and asked her coworker who agreed that she did not think they could. We asked them to please call the manager and confirm, because it seemed odd that they were not allowed to do refunds. The barista went away for a few moments, and when she came back she said that her manager told her that refunds are not allowed but she could do it this one time, but also said that if a customer didnt like a certain drink maybe they shouldnt order it. Im done with Mishkas for now...Ill check in in a few months and see if the situation has improved any. Users/KianaFreitas

I was just treated very rudely at one of your Davis downtown business and felt obligated to write you.  I have never felt obligated to try and correct bad business practices until today when I was publicly harassed in front of a full cafe.
The store manager was the only employees behavior which I am writing to complain to you about.
Here is a brief description of what happened.  I purchased a gift certificate from http://www.campuscred.com/ucdavis .  The offer was pay $3 for a $6 credit to Mishkas cafe.  The gift certificate had recently expired.  The gift certificate which I presented to the manager clearly states This voucher has EXPIRED and is only valid for the purchase price.  The manager read me the line in a loud and condescending manner twice then finishing with it clearly says it is expired and worth no money.
She proceeded to yell at me in front of the entire store that the certificate says expired and that it is worth no money.  She was very hostile and was using her position of authority to try and insult me infront of the other customers.  This experience was extremely embarrassing for me.  If she had simply apologized for not being able to accept the certificate at this time and she would ask the owner to look at it ASAP I would have been fine with that.  But she insisted I get something from the company I bought it from that states it was worth money.  This is exactly what I was giving her!  So frustrating
I would not support this business until the manager is fired and the business culture is changed. Users/EricPaoli
 LOL wow... in addition to being extremely rude, it sounds (if the quote is correct) like she was very much wrong, too.  Only valid for the purchase price sounds an awful lot like its worth $3. Users/TomGarberson

Thanks TomGarberson!EricPaoli
Owner just called me to apologize.  He defiantly took the side of his employee, which is understandable I guess.  The story he believes is I was unreasonable and would not leave for I think he said 8 minutes.  The whole process could not have been longer than 2 minutes.  Some regulars told the story to him and how his employee was in the right.  I appreciate the call, but be warned the workers here can be mean!

20120201 19:28:40 nbsp Sadly this doesnt surprise me at all. Ive been to Mishkas several times and am usually greeted by a very impatient staff. This doesnt surprise me considering what Ive heard from some of the former employees; they hated their job and the management. Users/TimJ

20120705 16:55:07 nbsp Ive been coming to Mishkas for over four years, spent hundreds, if not thousands, with my at least triweekly visits. Today when I went into the store, I had with me a halfempty coffee cup from Peets. A short while later, a male employee approached me and told me about the store policy regarding nooutsidebeverage and that I should trash the cup as soon as Im done. I said I understand. Not long after that, the actual manager came up to me and proceeded to tell me that having such cup is an insult. I politely told him how frequently I come in and made purchases there, yet he insisted that he doesnt care. Apparently years worth of loyalty means less than what a single outside cup represents. Well, manager who only sees the customers as sources of immediate revenue, I will from now on cease my insult and take my business elsewhere.   Users/NigelS

20120822 21:13:16 nbsp Its not about revenue, its about insult. Just because you feel like youre some sort of patron does not mean you are better than another human, while using up space that a PAYING CUSTOMER could sit in, while displaying and consuming another businesses product.  Would you buy food from mikunis, and eat it in Sophias and EXPECT to eat it there while merely taking up space and OUTRIGHT DISRESPECTING another business. Before complaining about staff, you should consider how you treat the staff. Also, as a mishkas regular, I cant tell you how many countless times Ive felt embarrassed at how you guys order.  You bark ridiculous drinks at the overworked barista and can be pretty damn rude!  Treat others how youd like to be treated....

   @CatLady: How does drinking a bit of leftover from another cafe before making a purchase equal to a superiority complex and assumed general rudeness towards the baristas? Textbook straw man fallacy.
@^  it was in response to the above previous reviews regarding other comments.  Dont assume an automatic correlation to help present your illogical complaint in a negative light ...

20130430 07:27:10 nbsp I will never visit Mishkas again. The owner of Mishkas lives in my neighborhood (A St. neighborhood, right next to campus) and he has been incredibly rude to the students that live in our neighborhood on multiple occasions. I understand finding the student lifestyle difficult to live with, but its a simple solution: dont live right next to campus. He has told my landlords that they shouldnt rent to students, and that students shouldnt live in this neighborhood, which is simply ridiculous. The part that bothers me the most about his attitude is that his business is highly reliant on students, especially those who live in the downtown area.
He constantly calls the police if he hears any amount of noise, and he has called the police on the sorority house on our block during their philanthropy events. This weekend while we were playing music in our backyard at 2:30 in the afternoon, he stormed INTO our house and screamed at us, calling us fucking ghetto.

Just to reiteratethis mans business consists largely of students and yet he openly hates the students and has no tolerance for any sort of noise in the neighborhood. Being a Davis local as well as a student, I understand that students can be irksome, however, if someone is easily bothered by noise there are plenty of quiet neighborhoods in Davis that are not populated by students. My roommates and I, as well as many of the other people in our neighborhood, will no longer be giving our business to Mishkas.  Users/ValerieBrown

20140503 22:10:29 nbsp Arrgh. What bothers me most about this place is that on the wall board describing Mishkas Bulk Coffee, Medium is spelled Meduim. This execrable gaffe vexes me to no endan offensive solecism preening mockingly over the assembled crowdfrom whose rebarbative glare, I can find no peace.  Users/MichaelPlotkin

20140620 17:26:37 nbsp If nothing else a place pretending to be a Cafe should always display some measure of CLASS and some semblance of sophistication.  For all its superficial style this place displays the exact opposite in tasteless vulgarity with graceless ease!

And for a Cafe offering even no delicatessenstyle sandwiches or small meals this little coffeeandsparsepastry DUMP has absolutely NOTHING to act PRECIOUS about!  Lets face it: the Twilight Zone town of Davis isnt very big at all on coffee shops and downtown Mishkas is just about all thats available.  So Davis denizens have virtually no place else to go for a decent brewexcept around the corner at a tiny, ubiquitous Starbucks, which closes three hours earlier than Mishkas, which has a lock on the service hours monopoly as well!

When it comes to CUSTOMER SERVICE though well take Starbucks over Mishkas anytime as the pseudobaristas at this cafe for the eccentric locals(like the one who comes regularly to stretch his legs up tree trunks!)and studyhall students have yet to master even an approximation of that simple concept: politeandcheerful courtesy!

So we get the boot from Starbucks at closing time and promptly relocate(as is our habit)to Mishkas, taking just as promptly an outdoor table.  As we had just got settled we had yet to pack away our Venti personal plastic Starbucks cups, mostly empty of beverage.  Were nighttime regulars, you see, and boast the marked buy ten coffee and tea drinks, get one FREE card to prove it!

No sooner were we seated with the EXTRA LARGE blackberry Italian Soda we just bought at Mishkas did this crazed, chubby, pale and rabid creature sporting a shock of bluish dyed hair make a beeline from the inside to the outside to very RUDELY accost us in her apparent trademark OBNOXIOUS manner:

Im sorry, she snaps, hovering directly over us, but outside drinks are not allowed here!

Apparently the large buttered popcorn we just bought(and brought)from that Varsity cinema theatre next door was quite acceptable...

We havent drunk a drop from those cups, I assure her.

They CANT BE HERE!  Theyre advertising for STARBUCKS!! she froths at the mouth!

At this point I was most tempted to say then we couldnt be there and wouldnt be back, either, and to take your overpriced, watereddown soda and SHOVE IT!!...but restrained myself for the sake of my guest...

We can pack the cups in our bags, I suggest simply, no problem.

Just as long as theyre OUT OF SIGHT! Ms. BlueHead froths further before whirling away in a frenetic frenzy something akin to the Loony Toons Tazmanian devil...

All that was called for here, really, was just a little tact and CIVILITY...not a near belligerent confrontation practically accusing us of committing the most atrocious mortal sin since Cain killed Abel!

Besides, its rather unsightly for any customer to be forced to witness up close and personal the very sad spectacle of a rather unlovely barista making herself even more hideous by her ugly attitude to the job!

Get over yourself, Mishkas, your dumpy little pastry joint just isnt that special...AT ALL!! Users/JosephCovinoJr
