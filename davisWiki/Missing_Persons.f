Patricia Morgenthal was last seen by her daughter, Deborah Morgenthal, at about 7 a.m. at the apartment they share on Donner Avenue in Davis. When Deborah came home from work that afternoon, her mother was gone.

Calls to her mother’s prepaid cell phone have rung several times before going to voicemail.

“I’m a little frantic,” Deborah Morgenthal said in a phone interview Saturday afternoon from her home, where she had been monitoring her mother’s bank account in an attempt to determine her whereabouts.

She said her mother has purchased two Amtrak train tickets and may have traveled from Davis to Fairfield, where she goes for her medical care. She also has made small debit card purchases at a Subway and Starbucks.

Deborah Morgenthal has been buoyed by the banking activity, because “to me it means the card is still in her possession,” she said. “It seems to me it’s all within reason for what she would be doing.”

She also said her mother has gone out on her own before and sometimes stays out late, but “she has not been gone this long before.”

“She’s a very adventurous person and she’s pretty independent, but she’s not really dialed in to what’s safe for her,” she said.

Deborah Morgenthal said her mother previously has had difficulty finding her way home, and she believes that may be the case now. Her mother also is without her bloodpressure medication, which she needs to take daily.

Patricia Morgenthal is described as a white female, 5foot5 and 150 pounds, with gray and white hair, possibly worn in a ponytail. Her daughter said she may be wearing blue pants and a longsleeved blue shirt, as well as a puffy navyblue jacket and knit cap, despite the warm temperatures.

She also wears eyeglasses, carries a brown purse with a long strap and talks with a New England accent, her daughter said.

Anyone with information about Morgenthal’s whereabouts is asked to call the Davis Police Department at (530) 7475400 or (530) 7583600.
