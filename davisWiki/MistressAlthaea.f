Name: Mistress Althaea

Office: Trained Monkey

Personality: Definately bizarre.  If normalcy was legally ordained in this country she would be locked away forever.  Fortunately she looks normal enough, it is only when she starts pulling out the stencils and vaginas that people start to worry.

Contact: Its best to keep back 20 feet from this one at all times.

20060609 18:42:58 nbsp I liked your voter guide, but i think you rasterized the type at a low resolution. What distro are you running, btw? Users/ArlenAbraham

20060609 19:53:01 nbsp I liked the voter guide too. Would it be possible to use embedded fonts? Arlen, if it helps you any, this is what pdfinfo tells me about that document: http://www.bayworld.net/~nick/PERBvoterguide_1.pdf.txt. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060628 22:07:25 nbsp I am running Ubuntu 6.06, WinXP and OS X on my dell box, thank you very much for the opportunity to brag about it. Users/MistressAlthaea

20060628 22:08:53 nbsp And the copy you got was probably a lores jpg version b/c i was lazy when creating the smaller pdf.  If you want to teach me better ways, I am all ears, oh wise ones. Users/MistressAlthaea

20060628 23:00:17 nbsp Kubuntu + EasyUbuntu, myself.  Ive got a server on Ubuntu Server, and if all goes well, by 2007 well be migrating everything over to Ubuntu Server from SUSE.  Nice little distro. Users/JabberWokky

20061103 17:44:54 nbsp I really like the voters guide, but you do not appear to be using outline fonts except in pages 24. Do you think you could fix this, it makes most of the document somewhat hard to read. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061103 17:50:08 nbsp If you need advice about InDesign, I know the editor of The Flatlander, and she uses InDesign. She might be able to give you some advice, and she would probably like the guide too. I can put you in contact with her if you want. Users/NickSchmalenberger
