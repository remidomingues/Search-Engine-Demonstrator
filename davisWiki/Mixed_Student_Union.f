Mixed Student Union (MSU) formerly MOSAIC until Spring 2006

 About the Mixed Student Union 
Mixed Student Union (MSU) is the only student organization on campus devoted to the Mixed Race and Multiethnic mixed race, multiethnic, and transracial adoptee community. MSU provides a fun, safe and comfortable environment for people of mixed heritage or those who are interested.

We discuss the growing issues on diversity and mixed heritage and explore areas of racial, ethnic and cultural identification, sexuality, media representation and politics.

We collaborate with other ethnic student organizations on campus for events to promote mixed heritage awareness. We engage in social activities to help with solidarity across marginalized communities at UCD and at other universities.

We pride ourselves in a very diverse body of members and celebrating all the various mixes of MSU. We also encourage those who dont identify as mixed but are interested in interacting with the community to also attend our meetings. We welcome everyone! :

I had the pleasure of speaking with a few members of MSU yesterday. They seem like really nice people, so Id like to encourage people to join them, if the club seems like your kind of thing. Users/JosephBleckman
