20060906 20:15:40 It is possible that they are just as bad.  I am currently renting from them, and everything has been fine until we had an issue come up.  Our landscaping service has not been keeping up, and after 3 months of contacting Acadian Properties Acadian we still dont have a resolution.  So much of my wasted time!  And one of the girls there, April, actually hung up on me cause she didnt want to help me!  If you can possibly rent elsewhere I say do it.  But if you really like the property, at least go in with your eyes open.  At the first hint of trouble, contact Community Mediation Service at 7575623.  They are VERY helpful!  Good luck!
