MoT is a neat prank with a website and buzz around Davis claiming to be an upcoming dance club to be located in the old Dimple Records location.  They created a wiki entry announcing, Davis first every highy energy night club dedicated to bringing the community a place to let loose and dance!  There was some healthy questioning of the situation, but it was Wendy Weitzel who confirmed it as a prank after speaking to the city and landlord.

Their description was, MoT (pronounced mote) is a high energy night club aimed to bring the people a place to let loose, go wild and dance all night! With its two bar areas, three lounge areas, massive dance floor, state of the art sound system, enough lighting to compete with the sun, snow maker, lasers, and more; MoT makes the perfect place to party any time.  MoT will be located at the former location of Dimple records (212 F street and is expected to launch July 2014!

 My thoughts exactly. I know Davis has a curious lack of a general nightclub, but something about this seems a little off. Users/CecilioPadilla
