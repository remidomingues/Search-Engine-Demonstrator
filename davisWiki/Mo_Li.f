 Candidate Statement (sic) 
This is my name: Mo Li Im running for senate.

This is my statement:  Read this gosh darn it!!!!!  It took me the whole 30 minutes between my Soc 1 midterm, which I just bombed, and the deadline to turn this in

Who AM I : When it comes down to it, Im the best kind of person there is.  Does that sound cocky?  Well Im probably a little arrogant and vain too.  Its really the hair that does it, but seriously, look at the picture
.Right???!!!!  I was born in China, a crazy place far far away.  I moved here after the wiki:WikiPedia:Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests to escape poverty, but I think Chinas economy is actually doing pretty well now.  IF you dont know what that is, you probably have seen the picture of the dude standing in front of the tank.  International Socialist Organization crazy communists!  I grew up in LA, where I became socialized in the ways of America.  I learned to eat hamburgers holding the back of the burger to that the patty doesnt slip out onto your jeans.  LA is a crazy place.  Living in Downtown LA was nuts, homeless people everywhere, maybe thats why I have so many deviants and miscreants as friends these days, no offense friends.  None taken, Right?  I have horrible grammer, and my organizationtional skills in writing are horrible.  We eventually moved into the suburbs.  The suburbs are crazy.  I learned Karate, and football, and wrestling.  And traveled back to china.  And also to Europe, and also to southeast asia.  Sumatra is a Crazy place.  Now Im studying Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology wildife biology, the love of my life, sorry schladies.  Shiggity Shwhat.  I play rugby too.  I have absolutely no experience whatsoever in being a senator.  This means Im honest.  So I cant get your vote by telling you how Im going to make this school better.  I, like you, have no idea how this school is run, Ive never talked to a senator about what issues are taking place, and where our money is going nor did I care.  I can relate in this ignorance and apathy. Lets all make it better!!!!Mo Li.

  I just read this again.  This is the funniest shit ever.  I sorta want to go back in time and vote Mo Li #1. Users/PaulHarms
