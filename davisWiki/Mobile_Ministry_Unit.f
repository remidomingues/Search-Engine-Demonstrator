 Mobile Bike Church 
In 2007, the Bike Church created a Mobile Ministers Unit to bring the blessings of the Bike Ministry to people that havent found the location at The Domes.  Mounted on a 6 aluminum trailer, the MMU is an attractive Mission Style building suitable for carrying all the tools of the clergy to any location in Davis.  The tower has alcoves for seven bells, to represent the Seven Virtues of Bicycling.  As of yet, pious patrons have brought three bells to the church, and we are eagerly awaiting further donations by the faithful to complete our worship facility.  The Church can also be used for napping or as a confessional.

Construction and First Ministration
The Mobile Ministers Unit made its debut on campus April 25th, arriving at The Quad at about 3:45PM.  While traveling through downtown we drew interested looks from bicyclists and motorists, and the unit handled pretty well, except for an awkward shimmy. After ministering to a few bikes, the ministers made their way over to The Domes, where the MMU was wellreceived by the Domies and other ministers present.

 

First Mass and Painting

On April 27th, The Mobile Church participated in its first Mass.  All the cars were Very Well Behaved, and The Bikes and The Church got along famously.  IO painted the church with a base coat of red and white on April 29th, then it returned to The Domes for outfitting prior to the Whole Earth Festival.  On May 10, Elizabeth and Julia painted The Church into a cottage style, with cute windows, windowboxes, and a fabulous stained glass window on the rear wall.  Siobhan and Pasture Ted finished the painting on May 11, adding some lifelike vegetation, identification signs with inspirational slogans, and another stained glass window at the front wall.

 
Ministering and Parading at the Whole Earth Festival

The MMU had a busy day at WEF, with workshops scheduled onthehour.  then the Mobile Minister Unit healed bikes at the Whole Earth Festival on May 12.  Two bottom brackets were replaced that day, a new record for the MMU.  After ministering, we went on a bike parade around the Quad, showing off the mobile church to all the festivalgoers, and circling each traffic circle three times, to honor the trinity of The Wheel, The Chain, and The Hollow Frame.

After a long day of ministering, the MMU and clergy returned to The Domes for a wellearned rest.

WhymCycleized!!!
On Aug 17th, 2007, Peter Wagner transformed the church into a selfpropelled WhymCycles.  A solid axle with two wheels was added to the rear, and a scooter with a kids bike drive train was added to the front.  It can now move under its own power, handles well, and looks really cool.  The only drawback is that the ergonomics arent so hot, so you can only go about 6 mph and get sore legs after 2 blocks.  But, its a step in the right direction.  Thanks, Peter!!!

(UpdateLate AugustPeter replaced the childs bike pedals with a handsome onepiece crank set off a Magna.  With the added crank length, Minister IO was able to get a 16mph reading on the police radar screen at 3rd and J.)

 
More Ministering  The church later led an entourage of 25 visiting bicyclists from the Buehler Alumni & Visitors Center to Little Prague for the conference pub crawl.  One blessed conferencegoer (a small Frenchman) was given a ride in the church itself.
 
Healing of bikes at Sept 15 Cesar Chavez Elementary Fiesta de la Bicicleta (Bike Fair)
 
The MMU ministered and participated in in Critical Mass on Oct 26th, 2007, and in the Halloween Ride of Mayham ride on Oct 31 with Mark Changs Piano Car.  After the Mayhem ride, Parishoner Sarah piloted the church back to East Davis with a passenger on board.  (Photos anyone?)

 
Transformation into a speedster!
On Nov 2nd, 2007, Peter Wagner replaced the kids bike drivetrain/front end with a snazzy NEXT 21speed front end.  The improved geometry and choice of gearing enabled the church to reach a top speed of 20 mph, sustained for as long as the ministers stamina allows (about 2 blocks).  Never before have churches been seen operating at such speed in Davis.  Under normal exertion it can now operate very comfortably for long distances at about 6 mph.   Thanks, Peter!!!

 
Recent sightings
