Mobile phones are nearly ubiquitous, either carried on most peoples person as they move about Davis, or stuck to the ear of an oblivious pedestrian walking into traffic.   Coverage and local availability in Davis has shifted and changed over the years.  See below for tips on what current coverage is like.

Many cell phones, such as Apples iPhone, offer internet access via WiFi access points.  On campus, this allows you to browse the web and check email rapidly, without needing a laptop or going to a computer lab.  You have two choices for access: Moobilenet, and Moobilenetx.  Moobilenet requires authentication every time you connect to it.  On a handheld wireless device, this means that you may need to reauthenticate quite frequently, since your device will probably go to sleep and give up its connection while you are not using it.  Moobilenetx allows you to store a username and password, and is also much more secure.  Because your device can send the correct authentication information, connecting to Moobilenetx is a much better choice, if your handheld supports it.  The iPhone will connect automatically after you set up Moobilenetx for the first time.

On July 1, 2008, Senate Bill 33 became law prohibiting all drivers under 18 years of age from using a cell phone or portable electronic device in any way (i.e. calling using an MP3 player or a laptop) while driving. A separate law making it illegal for anyone to drive a motor vehicle while using a cell phone without a handsfree capabilities went into effect on the same day.  CHP says that they expect to only enforce the law as part of a pullover, and not a reason to pull someone over. As of January 1, 2009 it will be illegal to text while driving.

In 2010, 11th District state Senator Joe Simitian sponsored the first bill to make it illegal to talk or text on a cell phone while bicycling.

Telemarketing to cell phone numbers has always been illegal in most cases and will continue to be so (http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/04/dnc.htm link).

 Mobile Phone Recycling 
Some ewaste information:
   The average user replaces his or her cell phone every 18 months.
   Nationwide, 130 million cellular phones will go out of use this year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That creates an estimated 65,000 tons of electronic garbage.
   From http://www.wirefly.org/news/cellphonefacts.php
In 2005 http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/0304/bill/sen/sb_00010050/sb_20_bill_20030925_chaptered.html SB 20 (Sher, 2003) Electronic Waste Recycling Act was signed into law, ensuring consumers costfree recycling of cell phones at all retailers and making improper disposal illegal.

 Coverage 

Cellular coverage within Davis varies considerably, especially indoors. If youre looking for a new phone or service, try and find someone who already has it or take advantage of the 1430 day trial period to make sure it will work where you want.  If youre curious where the Cell Phone Towers towers are located, you can see them on the http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/cmo/is/telecomm/ City of Davis Telecomm Site guide.


Verizon: Signal is poor to nonexistent in northwest Davis.  Signal is poor around campus and A street.

AT&T: Signal is (usually) very good in northwest Davis.  Signal is poor on campus, although there are a few spots (mainly towards the tops of buildings) where it is reasonable.  Signal is moderate downtown.

The newest GSM frequency is 850 so if you are using an older Tmobile/Cingular phone they wont be able to pick up the new signal.  This is why some phones work better than others in certain areas.  When purchasing a new phone make sure to pick up a quad band, for continous coverage in America and abroad.

In Kemper Hall, you can pick up a very strong AT&T signal, but not be able to make a call at all!  There is supposedly a microcell or picocell installed in the basement of Kemper, which is the source of the signal.

When shopping for a new phone and/or service, the magic number is $39.99. If you get a plan at this monthly rate or higher, the dealer gets a much larger commission than for lower plans. Thus, they will offer lower prices and/or larger rebates. Keep in mind that in addition to the above mentioned retailers, many phones/plans can also be purchased at stores like Safeway, 7Eleven and other nonphone specific locations.

Note that there may be an activation fee for new accounts. Also, the monthly rate does not include fees and taxes, which may be anywhere from $3/month to over $10/month.

Note also that, contrary to prior belief, most pay as you go plans are now much less costly than contracted plans at all dealers.

20050103 20:41:07 nbsp My phone switches between cingular and AT&T.  Even though the two carriers share towers, i tend to get different reception depending on which carrier my phone selects.  However, I tend to get coverage everywhere in Davis.  The weakest coverage is around campus, but is not terrible. Users/JaimeRaba

20050103 21:02:22 nbsp In northeast Davis (north of Covell), indoor reception is pretty poor with TMobile and Cingular. I can get a strong signal outside but it drops to 0 once I step a few feet away from any windows. Maybe my walls are lined with lead or something. Users/AndrewChen

20050104 00:43:02 nbsp I used to have horrible coverage (AT&T) in north davis, but since they combined with cingular, I get good to great coverage all over davis Users/PaulLanzi

20050105 14:29:16 nbsp I use cingular, and dont get reception in some places in Kemper Hall, and inside other large buildings like the Memorial Union MU Users/KenBloom

20050305 11:26:10 nbsp If you have free roaming and a phone that is not locked to a particular network, GSM is the way to go.  So that means AT&T or Cingular (basically the same now) or TMobile. Users/JaimeRaba

20051005 22:38:17 nbsp I have cingular, but my reception is really crappy around campus (no bars at all in many places) and at my house (along 8th street). I DO have a really cheapy flip phone...does anyone know whether the quality of the phone makes a difference? Users/YumikoHenneberry

20051008 13:53:15 nbsp I have a pretty good Verizon plan, but I get poor reception around campus. Outside reception is 23 bars give or take. Indoors you might get lucky and get 1 bar, but dont count on it. Other people in my building have Sprint and they get much better reception. Users/RyanCoates
  20081018 22:21:50 nbsp Id like to revise my comment to the effect that Verizon has really improved reception on campus with the addition of a new tower at the Howard IM Field. Service starts to fade on the southern parts of campus, but is pretty good in the central area, even inside some buildings. Some buildings will just never have good service due to the materials they are made of. (Although, I learned in a meeting at work that the campus negotiating to put low power booster antennas inside some such buildings). As far as the city of Davis, generally Verizon is decent, but has a lot of dropped calls (perhaps the network is too busy?). I have noticed, however, that service seems to drop off very suddenly west of Lake Blvd and becomes somewhat spotty north of Covell. Users/RyanCoates

20051106 10:06:13 nbsp I hate this to sound like a plug, but I never have bad reception with my cheapie Siemens phone on TMobile and I always hear of people complaining with the other carriers. I recommend TMobile. Users/SteveDavison

20060114 21:48:36 nbsp I live near the high school, have Verizon and lousy reception.  Were changing to Cingular but having both services for a month just in case.  I got Verizon to waive my early cancellation fees by asking to speak to your supervisor 3 times.  But they wont port my numbers.  They own them.  Its a catch 22 with the early cancellation concession.  Would like to know if there is Nextel coverage in Davis. Users/BarbaraClowers

20060114 21:50:34 nbsp There is Nextel coverage in town. Fairly good on campus and around town. Users/JasonAller

20060515 14:25:41 nbsp Im in the Tercero dorms and I have Tmobile. I always have service outside (13 bars) but I might lose it inside (usually its 1 bar max). Whenever I speak to my parents, they complain about a wooshing sound that I cant hear, but Im not sure if thats my phone or my phone service. I have one of those free phones they give you when you sign up. Bleah, but its my first cellphone and I didnt want to waste money in case I had to cancel. Tmobile is okay... I think Ill try Metro PCS next year, though. My dad has that... Users/NumiaCairaguas

20060515 15:00:38 nbsp If you have a Motorola go to settings>>Network>>>network set up and set the band to 1900/850, search to manual and search speed to continuous that will help..... Users/JonathanNasca

20060802 00:35:13 nbsp I lived in Alder Hall and I have tmobile. Worked great!  I had full reception in the dorm halls.  No reception in lecture halls though. Users/WaylandLee

20060901 18:19:19 nbsp I have sprint/nextel and the coverage is very good. My boyfriend just got a cingular razor phone and seems to have good reception too. So far Ive had good reception with Sprint  most places I need it (the Bay Area), so I would recommend them, except they just cut their minutes so now Im looking around. I used to have at&t back when the network sucked. How is it now? Users/GreenThing

20061029 21:35:28 nbsp I live at Fountain circle and I get horrible reception with TMobile.  Il have 12 bars, then itll drop to 0 or even die on me.  :/  Cingular has pretty good reception up here though. Users/WaylandLee

20070528 14:52:20 nbsp in my opinion, tmobile has the worst service for oncampus usage other then that, tmobile is really great around davis Users/DonaldJaye

20070908 08:40:19 nbsp I totally agree with the above user, I barely get service in Tercero and Olson, and in no other campus buildings, but in the U Mall I get five bars. Ive been all over Davis with excellent reception. A note about campus usage though, usually once you step well outside whatever building you were in, service will return. Users/KellyCorcoran

20080312 20:07:30 nbsp I have AT&T and live near Pole Line & Covell...not sure what changed in the last couple of months, but cell reception at my place went from 13 bars, to 45 bars on my phone. Users/DukeMcAdow

20080501 12:14:45 nbsp TMobile Update for on Campus reception: TMobile has a new tower in the center of UC Davis Campus scheduled to go on September 1st. This will help TMobile become one of the best options for reception throughout Davis. Please let us know if when you see a drastic improvement on campus. Go here for a picture: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid448840&id5671963257 Users/Aaron.Vorbau

20080618 21:40:50 nbsp TMobile on G Street was most accomodating to a particular problem I had.  I want to give kudos to their employees and manager. Users/bar775 (This review is the Wiki Community/Reputation only edit this user account has made on the wiki. While it does not invalidate this review, please keep this in mind)

20080626 12:45:59 nbsp Around 8th & J (College Square Apartments), Sprint has some pretty spotty coverage. I am unable to place or receive cell phone calls unless I am roaming :( Users/BrandonMinow

20081006 07:59:57 nbsp Where is That new tower in ucd? another scam?I just wait till end of october and then change it to AT&T Users/Frederick

20081009 17:19:09 nbsp In the past several months Verizon service has gotten much worse in north Davis, to the point that I cant even make a call from inside my house. There is a huge area around Drake Dr/Sycamore/Alvarado which is pretty much dead. Is AT&T any better in north Davis? Users/twblalock

20081208 18:15:49 nbsp I live in the Tercero buildings and all of a sudden about 3 days ago, many students that have tmobile have been getting service everywhere from wellman underground floor to the social science humanities room 1100 where hardly anyone gets reception. so Im pretty happy with tmobile right now.  Users/rmsanchez

20090418 17:07:15 nbsp I use Virgin Mobile and I have never been disappointed. This service doesnt have any contracts and you can change your plan every month. It is a prepaid service and you can recharge with top up cards from Radio Shack or through their website. This helps me a lot since I can switch plans. When I will be working in the summer, I will have a desk phone in my office and I dont require a lot of minutes. Also, their website has a feature called SugarMama through which you can watch ads and earn airtime. I live in East Davis and the quality of their network (Sprint) network is excellent. Phones can be bought from as less as $30 from either Radio Shack or WalMart. Users/Praveen

20090609 22:43:36 nbsp metropcs sucks if you enter a building, or your own apartment for that matter. It is suppose to have good service in Davis, but I guess they omitted the part about zero service inside your own room! Users/blastoff

20091103 15:37:20 nbsp TMobile seems to be at least partially broke today.  My wife and I get number not in service if we call each other on our cell phones, but we can still call to landline numbers.  Get some sort of not available message if I call 611.  Very strange. Users/JimStewart

20100212 22:37:37 nbsp I have Verizon Wireless and it costs a TON and I dont even have all the features (the only real feature I have is unlimited Text and Image transfer). A friend of mine got Sprint (he doesnt live in the area) with a decent phone and got everything for about what I pay. If I wanted to get everything he got for Verizon then Id have to pay like $30 more than what Im already paying. Does anyone know if Sprint works well in Davis and specifically in central Davis around Covell? Any current info? BTW, Verizon coverage seems to be pretty good everywhere Ive been in Davis. Users/davisRez

20101004 15:43:08 nbsp Mobile Connections has never closed and definitely still exists.  We now only carry TMobile prepaid and MetroPCS prepaid service.  We also carry chargers, cases, bluetooth headsets, and other cellphone accessories. Users/MobileConnections

20111001 22:14:31 nbsp Cell phones are absolutely worthless if people dont use them for at least two damn seconds to send response texts once in a damn while. Users/WesP

20130327 13:14:02 nbsp Im moving to the Davis area and need to pick up a new cell phone.  Are there any service providers that have abysmal coverage in the area that I should avoid?  Price is important, and I expect to use 34 GB of data per month.  Anyone particular pleased with their service / pricing? Users/KyleAaron
