 Inconvenient and Possibly Inaccessible 
 Businesses 
 221 G Street  All the suites that share this address (in a historic building) are inaccessible due to a massive flight of stairs.
 Beautiful Massage   The business is located on the second floor of the Court N Cedar complex, which is only accessible via stairs.
 Burgers and Brew  B&B has been known to block their wheelchair ramp with tables. When a person tries to go up the ramp, the staff is forced to temporarily move the tables (and any diners who might be eating from them) to make the ramp accessible. The same process occurs again when the mobilityimpaired person has finished eating and needs to leave. Its often embarrassing to everyone involved. As of February 2013, they still occasionally block the ramp with tables, and apparently couldnt care less about the disabled.
 Cloud Forest Cafe  The bathroom is not wheelchair accessible.
 Crepeville  (As of September, 2012, this problem has been corrected by the addition of a fully accessible table placed near the entrance.) It has been noted that some wheelchair users find the tables uncomfortable due to the physical dimensions.
 The Dumpling House  Many tables are tightly crammed together in a small building, making movement challenging but not impossible. The outdoor seating is probably your best bet.
