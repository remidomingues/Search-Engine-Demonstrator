Mocha Joes is a cafes coffee shop that is fairly unique in that it doesnt cater to studiers or students. Instead, it is a major pouring hub for commuters, retirees, and (probably South Davis) businesses that buy coffee for their employees. Hanlees, for example, regularly purchases coffee by the http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0006HVLVY.01A2RT822UHB0YS8._SCMZZZZZZZ_.gif carafe from Mocha Joes.

There arent many amenities for Study Spots studying. No WiFi hot spots, soft chairs or couches, or anything else besides typical cafestyle wooden furniture and fluorescent lights. Plus, it closes very early. When its empty however it does make a great place to crack open some reading (textbook or not). Right around 11:00 am, like clockwork, the shop soon fills with middleaged and elderly suburbanites. Perhaps Mocha Joes doesnt need the extra business that studiers and laptop users, hunkering down for chunks of hours at a time, might bring.

20051216 09:44:49 nbsp Its really out of the way but I went here one morning and had the best Iced Caffe Mocha ever! And plenty of pastries also ) Users/JoAnnaRich

20060306 17:20:18 nbsp Great place to visit BUT YOU DONT WANT TO WORK HERE!!!!! Users/MissCleo

20060319 13:39:58 nbsp Great blueberry bran muffins. I agree with MissCleo. You dont want to work there. Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060329 10:53:23 nbsp The regular coffee here was pretty bad. They have about 6 coffee pots to choose from, and I tried two (the French Roasts), both of which were really really weak and flavorless. With 6 choices, Id expect that at least one would be a strong brew for people who like strong coffee. The service, however, was quite good. Users/LaurenMcNees

200609292006 nbsp Jason and Sofia, the owners, are great people and their coffee is good.  They have created a friendly atmosphere.  I try to go in and say hello whenever I am visiting my parents! Users/AdamFlowers

20070212 15:52:16 nbsp I actually worked at Mocha Joes for four years and think that it was a wonderful place to work! It is a refreshing homemade atmosphere with wonderful staff, guests and owners! Users/MemoryRudolph

20070212 17:00:30 nbsp Absolutely the most friendly coffee shop in town.  Unfortunately, Im an espresso drinker and its not the best espresso in town.  But they memorized what I wanted within 2 weeks or so of going there unlike everywhere else in town who never have in years of visiting other establishments.  Now, if I could just get them to replace the espresso machine and add wifi...  Id be in heaven. Users/WesHardaker

20070813 13:43:45 nbsp I love their sandwiches. Users/EmmyMelton

20080222 09:44:14 nbsp Majority of their patrons seem to be older residents of the community. It hasnt been busy the past times Ive gone, and Ive never seen students studying there. So this place is a great alternative to other cafes like Common Grounds or Mishkas (both FULL of grad students, usually packed) if youre desperately seeking a quiet place to study. Also, the workers there are nice and often chat with their customers. The place is kept very clean. Users/at86

20080603 19:57:31 nbsp Nice owners to the public but working there is NOT suggested. They make workers do janitorial type, laborous work most of the time for minimum wage, new employees are expected to know things in a VERY short time or practically before they walk in.  Passiveagressively rude behind the curtains. Will not be receiving my business anymore! Users/1person1

20080715 10:25:38 nbsp I disagree!  I worked at Mocha Joeâ€™s for quite awhile, and yes maybe they can be a bit wacky, (they once warned me to not date a customer because they were afraid I would borrow money from him and be unable to pay it back, forcing me to become a prostitute) but I was never underpaid and actually received raises regularly.  They even took us out to eat on holidays!  As far as the laborious janitorial type work goes, I am not sure what you expected to be doing when you applied.  They take cleanliness seriously there, and I think that is very important.  All that aside, they have delicious treats!  I love the pastries and the feta pasta salad is a must try!  Users/kmitchell

20100804 13:19:11 nbsp Im pretty sure I saw a sign on their door/window stating that they have wiFi. Ill come  back and edit this comment if I find I am mistaken. Users/BaggedMilk

20110221 17:10:21 nbsp Nice owners, good service! My soy latte seems pretty decent but Im no connoisseur. Im writing this from inside so if they dont provide WiFi I dont know who Im stealing it from. They have a few power outlets which is nice for studying, too. Users/KatherineChiu

20110529 23:40:24 nbsp The lattes are great and the owners are great.  Even though I dont go in frequently, they remember me and remember my drink.  Their pastries are great and, as far as I can tell, they are the only cafe to provide both the Bee and the Chronicle for their patrons. Users/RMS

20110730 12:27:31 nbsp I really enjoy this place. Its a friendly family cafe. The owners are great and seem to have a number of frequents. Definitely recommend if you want a place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee without the students. Users/KalaPeka
