About

Modern Market Technologies (also known as MMT) was formed from Student Investors and Entrepreneurs as a student organizations student organization dedicated to providing real world business experience to students at UC Davis. In less than a year after formation,  students within MMT have created a business plan, spoken with venture capitalists, presented in front of store management, and have been recognized in an Arkansas newspaper. MMT allows students the opportunity to pursue business interests in many ways; by creating and managing a financial budget, researching a market and developing a marketing strategy, creating a sales pitch and executing a sale, and much more. At MMT, students work to build a business capable of meeting the needs of consumers and to promote entrepreneurship to undergraduates. We envision ourselves as the premier organization for UC Davis students interested in becoming professionals in business and entrepreneurship.


Modern Market Technologies began in 2010 derived from a UC Davis student organization called Junior Investors and Entrepreneurs (JIE).  In late 2009, one of JIE’s workshop speakers, impressed with the professionalism presented by JIE officers at a past workshop, granted JIE the opportunity to have exclusive rights to sell a product called Clean Cart Systems in Yolo County.  Modern Market Technologies was formed in June 2010 as a nonprofit to better address the demands of the entrepreneurship venture and further promote entrepreneurship education.

Current and Future Programs

Current Programs
Entrepreneurship Projects: MMT encourages social entrepreneurship and social enterprises.  Social entrepreneurship is finding a need within a community and solving that need using business principles.  A social enterprise is a nonprofit that supports itself through business activities and uses business principles to operate successfully.  These projects are student managed and operated businesses.  Students learn the steps to starting their own business by participating in the project.  Students take these lessons and concepts and apply them to running the nonprofit.

Future Programs
Mentorship Program: To encourage leadership and activism, we would like to start a mentorship program between professors, community members, and members of MMT.

Workshop: For students that are not involved with MMT, we host entrepreneurship seminars discussing our experiences and specific topics related to starting and operating a business and nonprofit.  An example would be learning the incorporation process.  These seminars will be taught by MMT members, which consist of undergrad UC Davis students.

Scholarship Fund: To further promote entrepreneurship and community service work within the community money earned from these entrepreneural projects will fund undergraduate scholarships.
