20081120 16:02:51 nbsp I will just say now, this will be a rave review. I made sure that they got a wiki page because they didnt have one and this place deserves it. Its a hidden gem. The people here are hospitable and professional. They are going through a bit of construction right now, so they look a little shabby, but it doesnt change the fact that the people working there really know what theyre doing. I went here for a mani and a pedi. It was only $30, well worth it and this was the first place in Davis I found that didnt hurt me once. They even have a copy of their most recent inspection on the wall, no violations. Oh and their massage chairs rock.  Users/LizBurciaga

20081217 09:02:13 nbsp Agreed.  Im SUPER picky about mani/pedi.  I expect THE BEST nails if Im paying for it, otherwise I would do it myself.  Modern Nails lives up to my high expectations.  They are super friendly and do a GREAT JOB for cheap!!!  The economy sucks right now but that is no excuse to not have your nails polished and looking HOT for the holidays so I would check out Modern Nails.

Ive lived here for almost 5 years and have been to almost every nail salon.  I dont live near Modern Nails but I will make the drive to get my nails done there.    Users/NikiRose

20081218 16:00:33 nbsp Wonderful services. I got my Brazilian wax and pedicure by Diane. She did a great job and the price is very affordable, I paid $40 for my Brazilian and only $20 for my pedicure. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for your nails ans waxing done.    Users/hana123

20081219 19:47:34 nbsp I have been going to Modern Nails for over ten years. I was worried when I realized they were going under new ownership recently. I have always loved the services offered. Well, much to my delight, Diane came in and revamped the place. Now Modern Nails looks very Modern. They offer even more services and selections then before, the place has been beautifully remodeled, and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. My nails always last a very long time and when they need touching up, appointments are easy to make. I have been to other nail places in Davis and always regret it. Modern Nails is the only place where I am always 100% satisfied. Users/RebeccaA.

20081229 15:43:55 nbsp Nice job. I got manicure & pedicure for $30, and eyebrows wax for only $10. They gave me a good foot massage and everybody here is really friendly and professional. Ill definitely come back. One more thing, the shop has been remodeled, looking nice and clean, should come and check them out. Users/JudyT

20090105 13:17:19 nbsp Nice pedicure. I really enjoyed it with the foot massage. I paid $30 for the special pedicure for the scrub and masque. Everybody should try it, I feel so relax after this. This is my nails salon now. Ill try to do it more ofter. Users/HelenM

20090113 13:36:18 nbsp I LOVE this place! I will not go anywhere else! i have been a loyal customer for about 8 months now, and have always been greeted by the very warm, friendly staff.  I have received nothing but QUALITY service and I always enjoy myself.  The remodel is stylish and the owner, Diane, is SOOO wonderful! Highly recommended: The special pedi! Its def.worth it! stephABA  Users/StephABA

20090125 11:18:44 nbsp I LOVE THIS NAIL SALON!!! I have been going here since my best friend got me a gift certificate for my birthday last year, and its my favorite place to get my nails done in Davis. I highly recommend getting the special pedicure, which includes a paraffin wrap, scrub, and this blue clay stuff that feels like Altoids for your skin, it is TOTALLY worth the additional $10! Diane is very friendly and does a great job! Users/evergeneva

20090126 17:09:36 nbsp This is the by far the very BEST nail shop in Davis!!!  I have been getting my nails done for over 10 years and have never been happy with any other nail shops in Davis.  I used to drive all the way to South Sacramento to get my nails done, until I tried Modern nails! I am SUPER picky about my nails and they always do an exceptional job and listen to exactly what I want and keep asking me if they are okay until I am completley happy.  Diane does awesome nail designs, the best in CA as far as Im concerned. Their customer service is wonderful and personable.  They even recognize my voice when I call now!  I love this place! Users/desmqh

20090208 23:32:15 nbsp I went there for my Brazilian wax. The lady did really good job, I didnt feel hurt badly like before, she has experience and do fast ( good for waxing) and very friendly. The first time here she charged me $45 and $35 if I come regularly every month, I think its worth for Brazilian. Im in schedule now and will try to have my nails done next time. I like this salon. Users/HelenD

20090331 21:23:14 nbsp I had an appointment booked on a Saturday for a manicure, pedicure and facial.  When I arrived for my appointment the woman who was scheduled to take care of me was no where to be found. I was told my the gentleman working that he had no idea where she was and that he couldnt get in touch with her.  Because he was the only one working at the time he was unable to accomodate me.  She didnt even contact me to reschedule/apologize.  I will not be going back.  Users/kmitchell

20090406 12:36:26 nbsp Unfortunately, this is not as good of a review as I hoped to give before going in.  I had been to Modern Nails once before for a Brazilian wax and was very pleased so I wanted to return, plus Diane said next time I came back it would be cheaper.  I called last week to make an appointment for this morning, which for some reason they did not have written down so I had to come back an hour later.  The woman was not very nice, and very painful, and it took a long time.  She also did not clean up afterward, and charged me full price.  When I said I was promised cheaper the next times I came back, she told me about the new owner and the full price all the time now.  I will not return to Modern Nails for a wax.  I was very sad to see and experience first hand all the changes because it was great before, but not anymore!   Users/LolaTorney

20090407 00:17:29 nbsp Im Diane, I sold the shop to different person and I know she doesnt have her waxing license. Please be careful or asking her license before let her doing your waxing. Im so sorry for LolaTorney that i couldnt keep my promise with you and other customers,too but Im still working in Davis. If you want me to serve you, please call my cell phone for appointment. Ill start working at MT nail next to Save Mart Supermarket. Again, sorry my valued customer for any inconvenient  Users/Diane76

20100720 14:24:15 nbsp I HIGHLY recommend ABBA salon & spa.  The new owner, Soon (or Susan) is incredibly professional, and does great work.  I love how she did my hair and highlights, and at a very affordable price. ALSO: every manicure and pedicure i have had here always turn out great! In my experience, they never do rush jobs, and offer quality services. :) Users/StephABA
