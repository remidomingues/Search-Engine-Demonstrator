Describe Users/MoeHirani here.

20120311 22:14:47 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  Are you aware that when you edit a page, the IP address from which you made the edit is http://daviswiki.org/Users/MoeHirani?actionuserinfo visible to the public?  Your IP, 174.34.202.183, traces back to Roseville  and its a hard connection, not a cell phone.  It makes promoting a competing business in Roseville while claiming you make the trek from Davis awfully suspicious. Users/TomGarberson

20120324 10:34:07 nbsp Hi Moe, I apologize for jumping to conclusions.  Unfortunately, we get an awful lot of competitors popping up on the wiki to badmouth one another and that sort of thing.  With the Roseville IP and the procompetitor comment, I assumed that was the case here.  Incidentally, it was another user who first made the connection.  I just left you a message about it.

20120403 15:05:43 nbsp I already reposted your comment after I saw your explanation. Users/CovertProfessor

20120411 23:36:04 nbsp Sure, it works to reply on the other persons page.  There arent any set rules for how to communicate. Users/CovertProfessor

20120412 09:17:19 nbsp You can leave a message on anybodys profile (part of that whole you can edit any page on the wiki thing).  If its a profile (the ones that start Users/), then it flags a messages notice in the upper right corner, so its handy.  Welcome to the Wiki, Moe! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
