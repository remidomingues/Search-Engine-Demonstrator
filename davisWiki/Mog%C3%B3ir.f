Mog√≥ir is the Irish word for rosehips which are the colors of his markings. He is a sweet little snake who is smart enough to realize that there is no point in trying to hide in his tank as he is cream, orange, and pink. He spends his days curled up in his hallow tree or on top of his hide box sunning himself under his heat lamp. Sadly he cannot actually experience sunlight because the UV would damage his poor unprotected by pigment (because he is albino) retinas.
