20100714 20:35:04 nbsp Morgan! How the heck are you? Wow its been a long time! Didnt you move to Texas, or something? I would love to hang out but I am actually moving to Germany for a job! Im not sure when I will be back (probably before school starts). It would be cool to hang out sometime! Users/ArianeMetz

20110226 21:48:41 nbsp Hey girl, I saw your comment on Crying Girls page about how hard you were working to make ends meet, if at all.  Hence, how I found this page of yours.  Sorry if I come off as a stalker.  But I was wondering, if youre in Davis often, have you ever considered Davis Community meals?  Itll save you money on at least a couple meals :) And you can take some extra food home sometimes too.  Users/KittyN
