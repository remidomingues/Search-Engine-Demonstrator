A wiki:wikipedia:mojito is a Cuban alcoholic beverage consisting of lime, mint, sugar, rum and soda. With the assistance and advice of other valued Wikiholics Anonymous wikiholics, this page seeks to perfect this wonderful beverage. Test out the recipe... too sweet? more rum? different kind of rum? different kind of mint? Dont forget to check our Alcohol page for more great ideas on how to rest your weary mind.

Some people and drinking establishments pervert the mojito with fruity flavors like mango.  Perhaps this makes the drink palatable to people who dont really like mojitos.

 Bars 
There are a few bars/restaurants in the Davis area that serve Mojitos.
 Little Prague 
For the best mojitos, ask for Jason, who is there Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
 Mermaids Seafood & Grill 
A traditional freshly made mojito with an addition of raspberry and mango purees
 Sophias Thai Kitchen 
Sophias was the first bar in Davis to start offering Mojitos. They currently offer the standard mojito as well as several flavored varieties including:
  Pomegranate
  Mango

 Make Your Own! 
 Single Serving Mojito 
  1 jigger light rum
  handful mint leaves
  1/2 lime  (Adjust for taste  personally, i use 1/8 lime.)
  2T simple syrup (simple syrup is one cup of water and two cups of sugar brought to a boil in a saucepan, stirred until the sugar disolves, and cooled).  You can use 23 tsp of powdered sugar instead, but keep in mind that powdered sugar often has an anticaking agent, so youre getting a bit of cornstarch or tricalcium phosphate in your drink if you do it this way.
  splash o club soda
Muddle mint, lime, & sugar in a highball and top with ice. Then, add rum & a splash of club soda. Voila!

Note that measurements will become less precise as the evening wears on.

 Afternoon Mojito Pitcher 

For an afternoon of mojitos, or drinking with wonderful, but lazy friends, its far more efficient to make mojitos by the pitcher. Make sure you pick up a bag of limes at Costco unless you want to go broke paying supermarket prices. Following is the same recipe, but with proportions adjusted for the pitcher. Watch out for guests who skip the club soda, because your pitcher will require far more frequent filling!
  16 oz light rum
  23 handfuls of mint leaves we used spearmint from the yard with good results
  juice of 810 limes
  16 oz simple syrup
  club soda & ice
Muddle mint, lime, and sugar in the pitcher (a wood tamper or spoon work well). Add the rum and enough ice to prechill your drinks but not so much that it melts and waters down your drink. Serve in the yard with a bucket of ice and soda water handy. Remember... the idea is for the bartender to relax with the guests! BTW: The guests were very happy with this recipe! True drinkers, all.

 Jims Trad Cuban Mojito 
  1 jigger light rum
  handful spearmint leaves
  lime
  2T cane sugar
  club soda
Pour a little club soda in a glass, then muddle in spearmint leaves and sugar. Now add the rum, more club soda, and top it off with a squirt of lime. Finish with a lime wedge for presentation.

 Summers Ghettojito 
Like our Primate Center primate cousins, Users/SummerSong some wikiholics have learned to simplify life with tools found within their environment! No longer do I handjuice 50 million limes and make simple syrup a day in advance. Measuring cups? Who needs Â‘em!? Ive discovered Minute Maid Limeade, and it has changed my life.

  1 can frozen limeade
  2 cans club soda
  1 can(??) light rum
  handful mashed mint
TaDa! Guaranteed to get you drunker, quicker.

 Variations 
 Users/SummerSong suggested a great variation, with frozen strawberries in place of ice! This makes for a dramatic touch.
 Users/JaimeRaba suggests using turbinado instead of simple syrup for a darker drink a lo Cubano... a Morito.
 Users/MikeIvanov says you can make it a Dirty Mojito by using brown sugar instead of white! He also likes to use a citrus flavored rum, such as Bacardi Limon.



20050526 21:00:38 nbsp We tried out your recipe last night (perfect night for a mojito!!!) and oops, I drank too much.  Very good.  I used less syrup, though. Users/SummerSong

20050527 09:11:15 nbsp You should try your mojito without the simple syrup, but instead with turbinado sugar.  This gives it a slightly darker, but slightly more interesting flavor.  This is the way they make it in cuba, where they (for reasons unknown me to) call it Morito.  Ennest Hemingway loved em, but his favorite recipe didnt even use sugar. Users/JaimeRaba

20050627 18:42:35 nbsp I like to use a citrus flavored rum, such as Bacardi Limon.  For a different taste, try making a Dirty Mojito using brown sugar. Users/MikeIvanov

20050706 14:42:39 nbsp MMMMmmmmmm I made a pitcher of Mojitos at my Fourth of July BBQ, and they were loved by one and all.  I used the advised amount of simple syrup, and thought it was too sweet, but my friends all thought it was fantastic! Users/SummerSong

20050716 21:03:10 nbsp Okay, Im not an expert, but I spent 4 months in Cuba drinkng these. They do not use syrup. The use pure cane sugar. They do not use mint, they use spearmint. To make it you poor a little club soda, put in the spearmint leaves and the sugar. You crush the leaves and mix it in with the small amount of club soda and sugar. You then add the rum, more club soda, and top it off with a squirt of lime. You also put the lime wedge in the drink. I have never had a one here in the US which is anywhere near the same of which they have in Cuba, Users/JimSchwab
  Spearmint is what we mean when we say mint.  It is usually the type of mint that is growing in our gardens and is used for cooking.  And simple syrup is just sugar and water, if you dont want the grainy taste of sugar.  Ive seen some places add a sugar cane for decoration. Users/MiriamKaufman

20050802 11:09:10 nbsp What? I dont think its a gay drink. Mojiiiiito Users/DomenicSantangelo

20050802 13:26:51 nbsp Daaang, Jim! Take all the fun out of drinking, why dont you??   ; ) Users/AlphaDog

20050802 13:48:29 nbsp Jim, Jim, Jim... Come on, now.  Have you EVER been to a bar and had a mixed drink that was exactly the same as it is at another bar, even within the same city or even the same street?  The Long Islands at G Street Pub G Street are different from the Long Islands at the Crazy Horse in Nevada City, but theyre both Long Islands.  Same basic ingredients, same basic premise, same basic tastesame basic drink.   PS Did you smoke any cigars in Cuba? Users/SummerSong


20060106 13:23:10 nbsp All these recipes say light rum.  Most bars in this town (and as far as Im aware, most of Cuba) use gold rum.  You can buy Plantation brand gold rum made in Trinidad at Nugget Market.  You may have to special order it.  It makes the best mojitos (in my humble opinion...) Users/JeffSpeckles

20080604 21:20:19 nbsp On Thursday Nights from 6pm to 12am, Bistro 33 has $12 pitchers of Mojitos with 5oz of the Bacardi in each pitcher. Users/BrianBaliwas

20080710 19:38:31 nbsp I used a mixture of mint and basil at a 2:1 ratio, and it was really good. I also prefer the turbinado sugar to syrup, but about half as much suggested. Users/ifoundthistape

20100715 02:24:02 nbsp I make my syrup 1:1 sugar water. still tweaking the fineness, but heres what I do:
1oz syrup
46 mint leaves (about an inch each, so adjust depending on leaf size)
half a lime (i use smaller limes, dont think theyre key limes, but theyre like golf ball size)
muddle this until the mint leaves start to break apart. muddling the lime will release the citrus oils. I love lime so it really lets the citrus speak
add ice to almost the top
tip rinse ice in a separate cup if using ice from your freezer. ice picks up the taste of the freezer and can really hurt the flavor of your drink. if youre buying ice from the store, then its perfect
add 2oz silver/light rum
top with sparkling mineral water (I like San Pelegrino for this)
this is done in about an 8 or 10 oz glass. its maybe 5 oz of water added

garnish with a mint sprig. presented, the drink will have a nice green bottom with clear water top. it will need to be mixed before drinking, but the presentation is really nice. Users/EugeneB

20100715 04:42:45 nbsp I personally hate Mojitos, BUT if you want a truly good Mojito you have to try to get Jason at Little Prague make you one. Yes I am there too, but no other employee or bar gets as many compliments as he does on his Mojitos that I have heard about.  Hell be there Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Once again, I personally hate them altogether and dont understand the love of them, but whatever. Users/WesOne
