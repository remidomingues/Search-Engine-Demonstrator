20080810 13:13:16 nbsp Ive been attending the Mojo Fit class, and it is a fantastic work out for balance, back strength and abs, I recommend it. It is quite strenuous, so its not for relaxation. Users/ceciliavh

20081006 15:36:35 nbsp I have been going to the Mojo Flow Level 1 class twice a week for a almost two months and it has definitely improved my core strength and balance. This class is slower than the Mojo Fit class, but still is a major workout for me. I enjoy the colorful room and the instructor makes exercising fun! Users/LauraSchaap

20100502 14:36:46 nbsp The pilates flow class incorporates stretching, handheld weights, and even dance exercises.  The class is easily accessible to all fitness levels; I felt comfortable even though I was out of shape, inflexible, and shy when I first began.  The instructor, Chris, is very amicable and gives personalized attention to all students even in large class sizes.  The membership price is monthly and very affordable.  I highly recommend the class if youre even curious about exercising with a group, check out this studio. Users/cphillips
