The Section of Molecular and Cellular Biology contains three majors: Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology.  There are a large number of faculty currently in this department and doing research in it.  A large number of the professors for the BIS 100s series are in this department.  In fact, Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef was in the MCB department.

The undergraduate advising offices for these majors are in 156 Briggs Hall.

They offer various seminars through the quarter that address issues in their field which are free to students and faculty.


This is one of the biology majors most connected to the Quantitative Biology and bioinformatics minor. A lot of the classes in this minor focus on mathematical models in molecular and cellular biology.
