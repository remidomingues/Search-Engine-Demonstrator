Moller International, founded by UC Davis professor emeritus Paul Moller, is a Research & Development local company devoted to making a flying car. The company claims to have begun development on a feasible, personally affordable, personal vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle  the wiki:WikiPedia:Skycar M400 Skycar. It is interesting to note that the Skycars Rotapower engines may be able to burn a variety of fuels, and is expected to be typically fueled with alcohol if the vehicle is ever produced (initial MSRP $1,000,000+). The Skycar is predicted to travel five times faster than most automobiles! The company originally started when Moller began marketing car and motorcycle exhaust systems called http://www.supertrapp.com/ SuperTrapp.

 Media and Public Appearances 

Moller International gives free public tours the third Thursday of every month from 2:30PM4:00PM. Just arrive at the front door before 2:30PM. The media contact is Bruce Calkins, bruce@moller.com When Users/SteveDavison I went on the tour, there were about 15 people including families, farmers, etc. The tour wound through every part of the building, there was no off limits area. I was impressed by the openness of the company. There are many historical things to see, so the feeling is a bit like visiting a museum. We walked past Paul in a hallway, who was absorbed in researching something on the web; nobody bothered him. A worthwhile tour to go on, once.
  I called the receptionist and she said the tours are no longer happening.  users/jimstewart

  August 16:  In response to a question as to how the Skycar was coming along, Mr. Calkins states in the Skycar blog It is easy to answer a yes or no question, or one that is relatively straightforward.  Unfortunately there are many factors to your question and the status of the Skycar and whether or not it will be ready to fly in October.  We are working as fast as possible to make this happen, but until we get a bit closer it is very difficult to say yes or no.  As of September, hardly a word has been heard from Moller regarding their progress (or lack thereof) towards meeting the 11 October date.  An exact location has yet to be announced.
  September 7  Moller general manager Bruce Calkins responds to an http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Stocks_%28A_to_Z%29/Stocks_M/threadview?mmm&bn42835&tid6236&mid6236&tof4&frt1 email from Yahoo message board poster JEFF asking when invitations to the Skycar demo flight will be mailed to stockholders and if any delays in the demo are expected.  Below are the text of JEFFs question and Bruces response.

Hi Bruce,
We are nearing the 4 week point, are there invites going out to stock holders as originally planned or will there be a delay?
Everyone wants to know.
JEFF

His answer>>>>>>>>>>>>

Hi Jeff. Thanks. Well be in touch.

Regards,
Bruce
(contributors comment:  with only 34 days until demo flight, this sort of answer is doing nothing to calm the fears of Moller investors that the demo will NOT happen)

  September 14:  Yesterday was 4 weeks until the October 11 demonstration flight when invitations were to be sent out.  No one has received one and not one word from Moller International about the status of the Skycar preparations, or anything else for that matter.  Why would we expect anything else?  On September 12, new marketing director Jah Mackey made his (?) premiere appearance in all the Moller http://www.moller.com/index.php?optioncom_content&viewcategory&layoutblog&id37&Itemid108 blogs, stating Hello, Im Jah the new marketing director here at Moller. I have been tasked with providing more expeditious responses to your inquiries, delivering the most accurate, up to date information available to your questions and maintaining all open lines of communication. All I ask in return is your patience and understanding as I try to catch up on the on backlog. Thanks again for your time and consideration.  However, in typical Moller style, he has yet to say anything other than this.

  September 21:  Tension in both the proMoller and naysayer camps is so thick you could cut it with a knife!  Yesterday marked 3 weeks until DDay, the October 11 demonstration flight of the Skycar.  However, not a word has been uttered by Moller, his talking head Bruce Calkins or the new marketing guy Jah W. Mackey, in well over a month.  This is not a good sign for the proMoller boys.  See the 1998 link above, 3rd entry, for a typical Moller response!  When difficult questions arise, the typical Moller answer is no answer.  Negative comments in the Skycar http://www.moller.com/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id155:skycar&catid37:blog&Itemid108#JOSC_TOP blog are being deleted daily, presumably by Mr. Mackey.

  September 27:  Strike up one for the naysayers!  Moller announced in a http://finance.yahoo.com/news/MollerInternationalIncpz4121698530.html?x0&.v1 press release that the October 11 Skycar demo flight has been postponed indefinitely.  In reading the press release, he makes it sound like a good thing.  The sponsorships mentioned will cost $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 each.  The Skycar will be used as collateral if he doesnt fly within a year of the sponsor making the payment.  He is certainly consistent, you have to give him that  announce and stall, announce and stall, into the sunset!  This may be the end of the line for him, but he will likely announce another date that he will fail to make.  He has to do something to bring the stock price up.  If he had anything that actually flew, he would fly it.  He doesnt, so he wont.  Here is a copy of the sponsor agreement File(mollersponsoragreement.pdf) and also a finders fee agreement File(mollerfinderagreement.pdf) that Moller gives to potential sponsors.

  November 7: Moller has hired a new company controller.  He now has 4 or 5 full time administrators, and three or four parttime technical folks.  One would usually expect such a company to be technician and engineerheavy, but in Mollers case there seems to be about 2 executives for every technical worker.  Also Clic Eyewear has been brought onboard as a sponsor, with the usual lack of any meaningful detail.

 But is it for real? 


Over the years there has been an increasing number of people who believe Moller is running a smoke and mirrors scam.  He has been two years from releasing a commercial model for the past thirtyseven years.  Enough people have invested in his concept and become disillusioned to hold informal Burned by Moller conventions.  The only flights his 400 miles an hour on normal gas vehicles have ever taken are short hoveronly flights of less than three minutes, always tethered to the ground, and always for groups of shareholders or potential investors.  The military has looked into Mollers craft and declined to invest or purchase due to the inability of Moller to demonstrate any practical level of performance, but have done so with several other personal flying craft companies.  In recent years, he made himself the President of http://www.quailoaksranch.com/ Quail Oaks Ranch, a company that sells Organic Almond Butter.  Moller now touts it as a way to live longer, pitching it in a pseudoscientific slick salesman manner.  He often mentions it in public appearances about the Skycar, and sends jars to reporters.

In fact, the Ranch company seems to be run through Moller. From their website, If you call to place an order during business hours the person answering the phone will say “Moller International”.  Please tell the person who answers that you are calling about almond butter and they will transfer you.  If you call after hours, when you hear the prompt “You have reached Moller International…” please dial extension 11. We will return your call ASAP during business hours.  If you place an order over the phone please also note that the charge on your credit card will read “Moller International”.  The company email is also quailoaks@Moller.com.

Other than shares in his company, the only things you have ever been able to purchase from Moller are kitschlike models, license plate frames, and glossy photos of his mockup M400.


35 Years of Missed Production Dates

In http://www.downside.com/scams/moller/ October 1974, Moller told prospective investors that they were on track for a December 1976 full scale production date.

In March 2000, his website stated When will M400 be available? Limited numbers are expected to be available within the next two years. These will be used for marketing demonstrators, special sales, and military applications. A FAA certified model is more than four years away.

In June 2006, his website stated When will M400 be available? Limited numbers are expected to be available within the next three years. These will be used for marketing demonstrators, special sales, and military applications. A FAA certified model is more than four years away.

In July2008 they indicated in press releases that they were on track to build 40 M200G groundeffect vehicles in 2009, and that they already has several airframes and the design of a new landing gear completed.
see http://www.moller.com/files/Volantor_Production_Ontrack.pdf
So far in 2009 there has been no mention of this activity.  It seems they are going to miss another promised date of production.

In both Mollers public comments, and his printed material, there is a consistent pattern of the vehicle in question always being about 4 years away from production, or some form of FAA certification.

The most recent missed date is one for an engine production deal.  In early 2009, the Rotapower website was stating that an Historical agreement was about to be reached with PriMon AG, a Swiss firm.  By late July, the notice had quietly been pulled down, and the site was once again indicating that Freedom Motors is seeking a venture partner for engine production.  In the past, Moller has repeatedly been on the verge of an engine deal, which subsequently never materialized.  Given the actual amount of work to be done in both development of the engines and the production processes, it seems unlikely that a venture partner will be found.  The site has a posting called  Comments on Rotapower engine where a lot of old things have been brought together, many with out date info. For example they are still talking about an http://rotarynews.com/node/view/189 engine deal  with Madami International for use of an engine in an ATV called the XModel.  (Madami has been an importer/distributor of low cost ATVs and the like).http://www.freedommotors.com/madami.html. This deal and the press release cited are now (in 2009) six years old.  This is an example of Mollers soft misrepresentation of the state of development ans/or the performance of his technologies. Madami has no active website, http://www.madami.com takes you to an under construction placeholder site.  Google also lists http://www.transnationaloutdoorpower.com/.  That site seems like a dead end with no info about any type of offroad vehicle, let alone the rotapowerpowered X Model.

By September 2010, all of the above links to Madami, etc. had gone dead.

In August of 2009, they announced plans to build one Firefly fire rescue vehicle, while admitting they do not have the funds to complete it.  All references to the production in 2009 of forty of the M200G (Neuera or Jetson) model have disappeared.  Given the Fireflys need for larger, dual rotor engines, it too, will likely never be built, or at least never finished and flown.  Here again we see the trackswitching tactic used by Moller over the years.  Many grandsounding projects are launched, but none are ever completed.

One year later, in August 2010, no progress had been announced on any of the M200type vehicles.

The company had indicated that it had several possible engine production arrangements lined up in China and Korea, but as of midSeptember 2010, nothing had materialized.

They also indicated to their shareholders that the new redundant flight control hardware, which was previously slated to be bench tested in early 2009, and flight tested in an M200G late the same year, was now delayed another year.  They now say it will be tested this year, funds permitting. The 200G vehicle in which the flight control system was to be tested never got much beyond the fabrication of a composite airframe, actually built in 2009.

They state in other communications that the M400 is being refitted with nearly complete dualrotor engines.  With these installed, and the new flight control system working, the vehicle will finally be in its intended configuration.  At that time, the company intends to flight test it again, in late 2010 or 2011.  This will be the point where it will be seen if the vehicle can meet it rather lofty promised specifications in terms of payload, range, and fuel consumption.  On April 18, 2011 a Moller http://www.marketwire.com/pressrelease/skycarmanufacturermollerinternationalannouncesscheduledtestflightotcbbmler1503369.htm press release announced  a scheduled test flight of the M400 on October 11, 2011 to take place in Vacaville, CA.  It also states Moller is seeking to sell advertising at this event, which informed sources say will cost sponsors (as Moller International now calls them) in the millions of dollars each.

The public demonstration flight did not take place.  Moller offered some excuses along the lines of having too many people wanting to come and watch.  In fact the aircraft was not ready for flight, because the engines were not finished.  The actual status of the onboard electronics is also unclear.  Now, some 4 months later, there has been no mention of any new date for such a demonstration.

Track switching
In 2010  Moller International offered 6 of its Neuera saucers and 6 of its M150 Skycars for sale.  Actually they offered to take deposits.  Only the saucer vehicle has actually flown.  The M150 is only a mockup, built for publicity.  It has only two nacelles, so it would be rather hard to stabilize in pitch.  No model or full sizevehicle of this type has ever been built or flown by Moller.  Lacking the engines to actually power either of the vehicles, neither is likely to ever fly.  Also, Mollers track record is highly unlikely to attract depositors.
2012  In early 2012 the Moller site again introduced two new designs the 100 LS and 200 LS.  Both are to be electricgas hybrid vehicles.  Moller now claims that these vehicles better suit the present market.  One rendering looks very much like the M150 mockup, with a bit more wing area added.  None of these vehicles has been built, and the claimed specifications are at the very least, questionable.  He has added a nonexistent 85 HP electric motor to the two rotor Wankel engine he also doesnt have.

This is a longstanding pattern with Moller, as every year or so he promises to be ready to produce some sort of vehicle, then rolls out a different design.  Thus nothing is ever finished, much less put through the rigorous testing required for a certificated aircraft.

SEC Fraud Suit

On February 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission settled a http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17987.htm civil fraud action against Paul S. Moller (Moller) and Moller International, Inc.   From the SEC website:

The Commissions complaint alleges that Moller International, a California company, and Moller began selling the unregistered shares of stock directly to the public via the Internet, raising approximately $5.1 million from more than 500 investors nationwide. The company was supposedly engaged in the development of a revolutionary personal aircraft, dubbed the Skycar, that would allow a person to travel at speeds over 400 milesperhour above roadways for about the same price as a luxury automobile. Moller, age 64, the companys founder, chief executive office and president, made false and misleading statements about the companys imminent listing on the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market, the projected value of company shares after such listing, and the prospect for Skycar sales and revenue. In September 2001, the company filed a fraudulent registration statement with the Commission that exaggerated the true scope of patents the company held for the Skycar. During the Commissions investigation, the company belatedly cooperated with the staff in an attempt to bring it into compliance with the securities laws and to resolve all outstanding enforcement issues.

The http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17987.htm complaint listed several False and Misleading Statements and Omissions made by the company, including:

In reality, Moller International had virtually no revenue, had never sold a single Skycar, and never came close to meeting the stringent initial listing requirements for either the Nasdaq or the NYSE ... the Skycar was and still is a very early developmentalstage prototype that has no meaningful flight testing, proof of aeronautical feasibility, or proven commercial viability.

Moller agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000 and to the entry of a permanent injunction to settle the action.

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17987.htm


Bankruptcy for Paul Moller  is the company far behind?

In May, Paul Moller filed for personal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of the US Bankruptcy Court.
http://www.sacbee.com/business/story/1962336.html
This is not for his company, but for him personally.  He listed assets of $46 million, and debts of $6 million.
Moller has been personally financing the limited ongoing activities at Moller International in recent years, due to a lack of investment capital.
Given the overall situation, his company may also suffer the same fate.  In their last few financial statements, they express doubt that M.I. will be able to continue as a going concern.

Some Say Yes

In response to the abovementioned SEC complaint, Dr. Moller explains the case to http://www.moller.com/files/twst2005.pdf The Wall Street Transcript:

  TWST: Looking back over the years as you’ve worked on these things, has there been any controversy? I read that the SEC issued a complaint.

  Dr. Moller: That’s correct.

  TWST: Could you explain that?

  Dr. Moller: Yes. Any nonpublic company (which we were early on) that raises money from what we would call angel investors or any investors has to raise it under certain SEC regulations that require you to determine that you are dealing with sophisticated investors. The problem is that sometimes people who want to become investors in your company will exaggerate their own net worth or sophistication, and it’s really up to us to determine whether that’s valid or not. We did have some investors come on board that the SEC argued were not sophisticated. Normally this kind of issue is resolved by providing a rescission agreement so that the investor can get his money back plus 12% interest. We have used this before successfully when any issue came up. The individual we were dealing with within the SEC resisted this approach. We believe he did so knowing that the investors in question did not want their money back and this would have voided his case.

See http://www.ripoffreport.com/QuestionableActivities/MollerInternational/mollerinternationalbrucec7d7ee.htm for the story of one investor/vehicle depositor who DID want his money back.

Any small company that has faced off against the SEC will tell you that you do not fight this powerful government agency. You accept a fine to settle. You don’t accept guilt. You’re not claimed to be guilty, but a fine is a way of getting rid of something that you could never win if you really try to defend yourself. If anybody has experienced a fight with the IRS or the SEC, they learn quickly enough that, as a small company, you don’t have the government resources to legally fight it. The few who try always lose.

In the SECs repost above, they state that The company was supposedly engaged in the development of a revolutionary personal aircraft, dubbed the Skycar, that would allow a person to travel at speeds over 400 milesperhour above roadways for about the same price as a luxury automobile...

The Skycar exists and has flown on many occasions, although only unmanned and unloaded, on a safety tether, with single rotor OMCbased engines running on methanol.  These engines produce about half the horsepower actually called for by a vehicle like the Skycar.  The skycar has not flown now (in 2010) for seven years.  If Moller ever develops the intended engine for the Skycar, then it may be possible to build a realworld version.  Due to weight and power limitations, the Skycar has not been outfitted with all of the required instrumentation and equipment required to support communication, navigation, and passenger comfort. Even with the engines in hand, a great deal of other work remains to be done before the Skycar can be freely flown in US airspace, even as an experimental class aircraft.

The SEC is not the FAA, so theyre only looking at the sale of stocks by Moller, not the validity of the Skycar.
The SEC did look at the technical performance, or lack of it in Mollers case, because he had misrepresented his companys capabilities, and the capabilities of the aircraft, in order to sell illegal, unregistered stock.

The earlier versions of the Skycar, the M200x, flew successfully for over 200+ flights, both in VTOL mode and in level flight. Only a few other aircraft have accomplished that: the Harrier AV8, the Osprey, the BA609, and the F35B Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). That puts Moller in some very heady company.

Note  the M200x has only flown on a tether attached to a crane.  The actual number of test flights was actually closer to 50, with most conducted without any plan or data acquisition, according to sources close to the Moller operation at that time. Most of the tests were under 60 seconds in duration.  This means the level flights Moller refers to were only 20 to 30 feet in length, at less than 5 mph.  This doesnt exactly put Moller in the heady company of great aircraft like the AV8B.

Just curiously, what does personally affordable mean? I cannot personally afford one, I am sure someone like Bill Gates could, where is the line to be drawn. Also helicopters are both VTOL, and significantly more personally affordable than this. If I remember my history correctly, as far as VTOL planes go, this is not the first nor does it seem to be in actual production, does that mean it is economically feasible?

        Im just a person avid about flying machines and technology in general. I have worked for defense contractors and I know that machines like this take time and resources to perfect. Ive been in the same place as Moller, designing new hitech products, so I understand the processes it takes to perfect an idea. He has flown, which is more than most people have been able to do with a VTOL aircraft. Its an idea whos time has come.

        The man earned a PhD in Aerodynamics (I believe) without taking any undergraduate courses (from a documentary on the Discovery Channel, I think). He holds 20+ patents. the way the SuperTrapp works is, IMHO, pure genius. And I say this from the standpoint of someone who is a fellow inventor. And no, I dont know the guy, but if youre making assumptions from the fact that youve worked with Moller, I think you may be written off as a disgruntled employee, rather than an unbiased observer. Users/EllasBates

One of Mollers biggest problems is his lack of the fundamentals he would have gotten by taking all of those math and physics courses as an undergrad.  The repeated failures of several of his early designs are evidence that he could not or did not do even the simple calculations to determine the required horsepower. He also did not think a stabilization system was necessary.
XM2  underpowered and without stabilization  wobbled around in ground effect, but not controllable.
XM3  two versions of a diskfan vehicle. Had 8 gokart engines, and no mechanism to counter main fan torque. Did not fly in either version.
XM4  First version (after turbojet power idea was abandoned) has 25HP FichtelSachs rotary engines, and no stabilization system.  Not enough power to fly, amd would have been uncontrollable without artificial stabilization.  Second version had 50 HP OMC rotaries, and stabilization.  it flew.

                Ellasactually I am not disgruntled and really should not be written offas you say The supertrapp muffler idea came from a graduate student of his (I think) on radial diffusion, (a thesis paper)if you must know, and judging from your comments you are the one personally attached to this guy, so when is it going to fly? Also if you read the SEC complaint, he really has no patents at all, and why would he have disgruntled employees anyway, do some homework before you start calling people genius etc. I lost a lot of money with this guydid you invest too? Users/NotImpressed

20070329 09:32:08 nbsp Above, moller answers one questions, The Skycar exists and has flown on many occasions, I remember at one stock meeting he attempted to fly it(without a man onboard) and it was so out of control that the safety crane had to pull it up. Of course after spraying us all with smelly exhaust gases and grass clippings, I wouldnt consider that flying. Users/NotImpressed

20070329 09:48:30 nbsp 20 patents means very little.  It matters what the content of those patents are.  I would also say that more than a few aircraft have had VTOL capabilities.  I know of several from my time at NASA that are not included.  Also, the main reason there are few probably has to do with required capabilities rather than difficulty of design. Users/DavidGrundler

20070329 12:07:13 nbsp It seems like they just cant quite finish it, some new changeengineswings or they need more funding. Moller has said they have spent over a hundred million dollars on itthats $275,000 every month for thirty years, funding should not be an issue. Users/NotImpressed

20070330 22:42:43 nbsp  Since you call him a genius you must have vested with him too, I am suprised at the updates to this pagewhere did this info come from? Users/NotImpressed
  The updated information is the natural reaction of the wiki; akin to a wiki immune system. When an anonymous person logs on and starts making negative comments on an otherwise inactive page it causes interest to be raised. Among the questions that get asked are What is this persons agenda? and Have they edited anything else, or do they seem to be a single topic user?. Once that happens people put more effort into http://daviswiki.org/Moller_International?actioninfo improving the information on the page. Someone looked up a partial list of the patents, someone else linked those to the USPTO website, I stopped by and took some photos to add color to the page. The fact that you used a sock puppet causes even more attention to be focused on your edits and another group of people are following what is going on because of that. Users/JasonAller

  20070507 00:13:34 nbsp The Davis Wiki is not intended for debating, oftentimes comments are removed because they detract from the purpose of the discussion  and that is to make the articles better. Users/KarlMogel

Should I control what you post with what you are happy or unhappy with? I know we have deterred from the subject, but if people cant post their own views then this is not a true wiki. I am continuing this to help improve your site or at least the editing, I still believe in the freedom of speech.    Users/NotImpressed

I do appreciate your comments and will try to stick to the subject matter, do you know what happened to the SDI sign on the Moller Sign? Users/NotImpressed

20090429 10:52:22 nbsp Regarding the mystery of the missing sign, the original SDI Flight Systems sign was stolen, and rather than simply replace it we elected to redesign the sign, replacing the wooden one with a new “tombstone” style sign which identifies Moller International, Freedom Motors and SDI Flight Systems as occupants of the facility. I believe this was completed in early 2008.  SDI Flight Systems is a subcontractor of MIs as well as a tenant. Users/brucecalkins

The new sign photo looks fake  there is no shadow for the sign, while other objests shadows indicate the sun was roughly overhead when the background photo was taken. Users/Billyknowes
  As you say, the sun must have been overhead, casting a relatively small shadow. Plus, it is over grass, and could be in the middle of a small depression. Both could easily hide a midday shadow for something with that small of a crosssection Users/JoePomidor
  The sign is real, but the background is fake.
    The sign and background are real, the wiki is fake.
      The wiki is real, but the sign, background and Davis are fake.
        Davis is fake, but everything having to do with Moller is real.
          The sign and Davis are real, the wiki and the background are fake.  Except the cows.
The picture of Peter Levin flying the saucer on the website is certainly fake  it was uh, produced several years before the saucer actually flew, and used in various Moller promotional brochures, etc.
Even with a saucer which actually flew a few times, they use the fake shot instead.

Has anybody heard how they are doing on the new M200G  they said they were planning on building 40 in 2009.  I havent seen any mention of it in the press or on the Moller site?
Sept 2010  no M200Gs have been built as of this date.
Sept 2012  no M200Gs, or anything else for that matter, have been built as of this date.


Rotapower has a new site up  it can be accessed from Mollers site.
Not much new  the two links to PriMon AG, who are supposedly going to build the rotary engine, are dead.
There is another fake hover picture of the small model of the big (M600) design  with no caption to indicate that it is not real.
There is a picture of a young man holding a two rotor short block, claiming 160 HP. As usual, its not a complete engine, just a block with a starter motor and plugs.
Why dont we ever see a complete engine, running on a test stand or a dyno???
The Intelectual property page is empty (hmm....)
And the Engine test data page doesnt really contain any test data.
All in all, a fine example of Moller marketing collateral.

What ever happened to the testing they were going to do at the milk farm? Did that fall through?

Looks like the Milk Farm development deal is not going to happen, so probably no testing.  The Skycar is not ready for test anyway.  Curious, considering they have been at it for 15 years or so...

20090605 16:07:31 nbsp I took the tour at once point.  It seemed to me to be a dog and pony show to attract investors.  It could have been the day, but when I was there, there were only a few employees in the entire facility, and the company was relying upon contracts to manufacture items for other companies (if I remember correctly) to keep its cash flow positive.  They made a big deal on the tour out of a lot of wishful thinking  if only the DOD would fund them to finish the skycar, etc.  But they dont exactly have the best (or any?!) track record that I know of of getting anything in the air for more than a very short time.  Its too bad, because I used to love reading about the technology that they were inventing, and I wanted to see them succeed and maybe have my own skycar some day.  But I really doubt that we will ever see it work somehow... Users/IDoNotExist

If you want to see some impressive UAVs, go to these two site  the second one has some video of a unit being flown very aggressively.
Mollers overweight junk could never fly like this.  Getting rid of the ducts and extra body really let a small multi prop (not fan) unit perform.
Of course, staying on the ground is what Moller is good at!
These hobby guys are light years ahead of Dr Mo.
Because theyve got more talent, and they want to succede at flying, not at scamming people.
http://ng.uavp.ch/moin  this site covers a number of flyers
http://vimeo.com/4476849  great video of one multi fan unit in flight.
 Yeah, those are pretty cool, but they also weigh a few pounds at most. I think that scaling it up to human transport level, like Mollers trying to do, is something altogether different. Users/MattJurach
   But there have been several personal VTOL craft developed in the latter half of the 20th century by various companies, mostly for military use.  Some neat footage exists of the earlier ones, recycled into dozens of History Channel and Military Channel documentaries.  Drop the VTOL aspect and thousands of people build single or two person ultralights in their garages and fly them for recreation.  jw

20100518 11:02:41 nbsp I know the discussion thread is old but wonder if some of the early posters are around and have changed their opinions? Mollers personal bankruptcy and the fact his flying car is still a pipe dream should be proof he has been conducting fraudulent practices the entire time. Im surprised all his pilfered investors havent started a classaction lawsuit against him. Or maybe they have? Users/checkplease

20100518 13:02:15 nbsp Poor cash flow from a company (or an individual) does not indicate fraud.  (In fact, about 9/10 businesses fail, which almost certainly means that they were not able to generate sufficient cash flow to stay in business.)  Nor does failure to develop a successful or marketable product.  (In biotech, for example, the vast majority of companies never manage to bring a product to market.)  To be fraud, there has to be an intentional deception. Users/IDoNotExist

20100909 07:54:22 nbsp Such a decption is mentioned in the SEC complaint. They use the term false and misleading statements. Also, how can one take the fake picture of the hovering saucer (then the XM4) with Pete Levin at the (fake) controls as anything other than fraud? Users/FelixWankel

20110907 08:45:11 nbsp I first heard of Mr. Moller in the mid1980s from a colleague at the aerospace company where I work.  He was even listed in Janes All the Worlds Aircraft.  He was laughable even then.  I caught wind of his upcoming (Oct. 11, 2011) scheduled test flight and have been following his latest adventure.  I cant believe there are people out there still supporting him and the excuses they come up with to justify their support.  I have been started updating this Wiki to keep others informed of his lackofprogress and trying to stay objective, but it is difficult! Users/my2cents9

20110914 12:54:47 nbsp Find it incredible that after all of these years, several other companies have produced proven flight capable autos while Moller still sits idly by with his flying Skycar attached to a crane for Safety reasons and has never advanced it to any type of true testing or demonstration. Users/WesP

20120627 11:15:30 The engine design is not real, never been produced. Why not change it out for turbos? Why does the Williams wasp fly so well and stable but something with 4x the engines cannot. So now the wasp is in black out. Its over 30 years old and was stable. This can be done, its probably being done. We may find Mr. Moller is a patriot running a blackop. After all there has to be some reason for this.  Users/Assalon5
