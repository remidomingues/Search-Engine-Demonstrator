Platform Issues / Senate Goals:

PREVENTATIVE MEASURES AND ACADEMIC PROBATION ACTION PLAN

 Establishing a brochure for students on academic probation in order to retain students, instead of dismissing them. There will also a blurb on SMARTSITE linking you to the brochure if a student runs into problems and does not know where to get the brochure. Also, making sure that students who are performing academically well continue to do well by sending out a reminder every quarter of how to continue that path.


TRANSFER/ INTERNATIONAL FALL KICKOFF

 Establishing a transfer student orientation that students actually know about and are able to go to.
 Creating a fall kickoff where transfer and international students are able to come to a safe space and network as well as learn out about other resources.
 Establish a transfer Halloween shadow day for transfer students who come in later in the year.


GUARDIAN SCHOLARS

Establish programs to help students who were in the foster care system transition with more ease and advocate for them by getting funding from other businesses and providing these students with resources to keep them in school.
