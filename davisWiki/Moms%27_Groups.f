University Farm Circle used to have a Moms Group for moms with or without strollers, grandmothers and newcomers to Davis too. They would walk along the Arboretum to get some air, exercise and be Social structures social! Organized by the University Farm Circle, they met on Thursday mornings in front of the Borders Borders Books entrance on the parking lot side, at 9:15am and depart at 9:30am. The walk lasted roughly an hour. The first walk was membership free, after that they asked that you become a member, $26 a year which helped to support scholarships awarded to UC Davis students.
