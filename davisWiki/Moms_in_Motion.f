http://momsinmotion.com Moms in Motion was a gyms fitness group in Davis for women. According to their website, it is a global organization with over 3,000 members involved in community teams in nine countries and 830 US cities. They enable parenting mothers to connect through fun, fitness and philanthropy.  Membership is free (except maybe for the philanthropy), and beginners are encouraged to join. Apparently it wasnt very popular and the organizer moved to Santa Barbara, so its not happening in Davis anymore.


20100919 12:40:40 nbsp This never existed in Davis.  I phoned up Nancy, and she lives somewhere in Santa Barabara I think.   She put this flier up, and tried to get something going, but moved south before anything happened.  That is my recollection.  I wish the Wiki was a little more careful before creating new pages like this.  Now there is no way of removing it.   It has probably wasted quite a few peoples time. Users/crpike
