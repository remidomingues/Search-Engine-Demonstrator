20100126 20:21:51 nbsp The reason that William ask you to do so is that this is a Wiki Community community wiki and we are your neighbors and the people you meet in town. If you edit using your real name you are participating in that community as another member of it. If you edit using an the name of an institution you separate yourself from a community of people and stand apart. It also limits what you can say on the wiki for fear of any comments made using this account sounding like an endorsement, or potentially reflecting negatively on the Mondavi Center.
