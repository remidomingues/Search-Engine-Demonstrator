The Mondavi Center for the Arts opened in 2002 as UC Daviss beautiful new home for its University Symphony Orchestra and other cultural events. It gives a more upscale environment to host events than Freeborn Hall.  The center is named after the late vintner, Robert Mondavi, and his wife Margrit Mondavi, who donated $10 million toward the building cost. The project was estimated to cost $60.9 million. Sandstone tile covers the outside of the building.


History

The Mondavi Center was built on the site of Parking lot 1A Lot 1A, which was reported to have been built over a former Native American burial ground for the Patwin tribe.  See the  Parking Lot 1A entry for more information. In Summer of 2011, the building underwent repairs to fix waterproofing under the sandstone tiles. Many of the tiles will be replaced and the repairs will last until December 2011.

 Performances 

Every firstyear undergraduate and graduate UC Davis student, as well as all firstyear UC Davis transfer students are entitled to one free ticket to any performance on the current calendar. Details can be found on http://www.mondaviarts.org/free/ their website but this includes everything from ballet, dance, and theater companies; retrospective films; live music performances by artists like Elvis Costello, YoYo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Buddy Guy, Wynton Marsalis, and the New York Philharmonic; and spoken word events featuring guests such as Sarah Silverman, Oliver Stone, Patty Smith, David Sedaris, Ira Glass (NPRs This American Life host) and Arianna Huffington (founder of The Huffington Post).

The 20112012 season features the 10th anniversary of the Mondavi Center, marked by a gala event cohosted with the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine & Food Science. The Saturday, March 17, 2012 event will include the U.S. Premiere of Ballet Preljocajs Blanche Neige, an adult retelling of the Grimm Brothers classic, Snow White, and a sold out $1,000 per plate fundraiser dinner.  A second, matinee performance, is scheduled for Sunday, March 18 at 3 p.m.

Opening night is Friday, September 30th and features 14time Grammy winner, Ricky Skaggs with his bluegrass band, Kentucky Thunder.  There are approximately 85 worldclass performances featuring jazz, bluegrass, guitar, opera, symphony, concert piano and violin, distinguished speakers, percussion and world stage artists between October and midMay when the season concludes.  Seats sell out quickly for major events and ordering well before the event date will ensure you get the best seating.  Additionally, Mondavi Center adds 56 late additions to its performance schedule, so watch for them.  In the past, late additions have included Tony Bennett, Elvis Costello, Lyle Lovett, John Clease and Arlo Guthrie.

Also, the Mondavi Center has played host to a statewide televised Whitman Brown Debate Whitman Brown  2010 gubernatorial debate.

In addition, all students (no matter which school you attend) get a 50% discount. Some find the performances to still be a bit pricey, but this is still a good deal for acts that might otherwise be completely unaffordable. Other performances, like a Mahler concert, can run as low as $14 for nonstudents. Given the headliners and famous speakers that the Center draws this can be a good place for Celebrity Sightings celebrity sightings.

Exclusive ticket promotions and giveaways are available throughout the year and the only way to find out about these is to sign up on the Mondavi Center Facebook or Twitter page. There are also a number of free shows at the Center sponsored by various campus departments. Please check the Mondavi Center event schedule for a list.

If youre a student, join the student listserve and periodically they will email specials to students.  Usually a show is $7 to all students and sometimes free Woodstocks pizza.  The catch is when you order via online (you have to), there is a fee for online purchases (Believed to be $2, please check on this).

 Jackson Hall 

Jackson Hall is the main event room in the Mondavi Center.  It has four tiers and areas of seating and can hold up to 1800 people.


The hall is named after Davis resident Barbara K. Jackson and her late husband W. Turrentine Turpie Jackson, who was a UCD history professor. Jackson made her $5 million gift in March of 2001, a critical time when the fund drive for the (then unnamed) center appeared to be in danger of faltering.  If her gift had not been eclipsed soon after by the Mondavis donation, we might very well have the UC Davis Jackson Center instead.

Barbara Jackson has her own box seat in the hall, shown at the arrow in the picture above.  Even ushers rarely see her, since she usually comes through the performers entrance and walks up the fire exit stairs just before the curtain.

Jackson Hall has exceptionally clean and precise acoustics. The hall changes between amplified and unamplified setups. For amplifed shows, such as jazz, folk, blues and spoken word, a system of drapes and banners is deployed, dampening the space. The hall also features the world class Meyer Sound Melodie line array. The drapes, banners and speakers are retracted and replaced with a 26 ton acoustical enclosure for classical events, creating an acoustically live space, where you can hear a pin drop.


 Vanderhoef Studio Theatre 

The adjacent Vanderhoef Studio Theatre is for smaller, more intimate performances like small jazz bands, string quartets and piano recitals.  The seating can be rearranged to hold up to 250 people, has a club atmosphere and a refreshment bar.  The three arrangements are:

The theatre was named in honor of Larry and Rosalie Vanderhoef in recognition of their efforts to establish the Mondavi Center.

 Notes 

  There are No Backpack Policy no backpacks allowed inside the auditorium. Their solution is having a couple tables in the lobby (for you to leave your backpack on or under) with a sign warning that it is unattended and that you leave your valuables there at your own risk. Fools! They desperately need to install lockers, such as they have at Segundo Dining Commons. More http://sfmoma.org/ intelligently thoughtout places have attended coat check rooms.
  Be sure to bring your student ID if you purchased a student ticket.
There is no longer an ATM in the lobby.
  Visit http://www.mondaviarts.org/aboutus/employment_volunteer.cfm their website and http://www.mondaviarts.org/aboutus/NewVolunteerApplication.pdf sign up to become a volunteer usher. See great shows for free! There is a lengthy application process, dress code, etc. Its not a way of getting in for nothing...
  Some have commented that it looks like its made of plywood from the freeway, and a shrubbery or two would improve the look.
   Once trees grow up around it, it will look better. Trees make anything look better. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  There is a gift shop that sells plenty of unnecessary things, like wine with the Mondavi Center on the bottle.
Concessions aint cheap, but the nice old ladies dont really care.

 Parking 

Parking is available across the street in the parking structure.  TAPS works every night that the Mondavi holds an event and charges $7 per vehicle as of 9/2011.  Dated parking passes for $7 can be included with your tickets when you prepay for tickets through the Box Office or online.  This expedites your arrival in the parking structure since you dont have to wait in the line of patrons vehicles individually paying for parking permits.

You can avoid the $7 parking fee altogether by walking, biking or using shuttles which dropoff directly in front of the Centers doors.

The average wait time to get out of the parking lot is 15 minutes (thanks to TAPS blocking off exits).  Options to avoid this wait is parking in other parking lots (some have visitor machines that put out visitor permits), leave the performance early, or sit in your car for 20 minutes while the traffic clears out. The closest lots are 3 (next to Mrak Hall) and 46 (next to Academic Surge), which allow for visitor parking after 5pm. On the weekend, TAPS does not enforce parking so you can avoid paying the $7 by using one of these lots (or nearby streets) rather than the Mondavi parking structure.

    I was really disappointed today when I went to the Mondavi Center buy advanced tickets for a performance tomorrow, just to find out that they now only sell those through ticketsmaster. Ticketsmaster, in turn, charges “handling” fees that make it unaffordable for my family to attend these events. On occasion, when I was waiting for a performance in the past, I’ve overheard people from Sacramento saying that they would drive all the way to Davis to purchase an advanced ticket, to avoid ticketmasters’ absurd handling fees. And I, who live in Davis, have always purchased my tickets there; it’s just a bike ride away for me. I’m sure the Mondavi Center will lose customers and that performances are now a step further away from people like me in the Sacramento area. Users/UpsetCustommer
