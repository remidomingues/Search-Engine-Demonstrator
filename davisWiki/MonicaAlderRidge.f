20111111 16:06:51 nbsp To echo Pete, thanks for using your real name! Unfortunately, your recent descriptions of the apartment complex were a bit too similar to an advertisement to be allowed under the wikis nonprofit restrictions. They will likely be edited for that reason. I know it all can be a bit confusing and its really not a big deal, but I just wanted to inform you about it. Welcome to the wiki indeed!
