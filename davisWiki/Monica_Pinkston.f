Monica Pinkston was formerly employed at Cobalt Salon & Gallery. She has been styling hair for 7 years, and particularly enjoys mens haircuts, clippers cuts, and fades. She prides herself on her perfectionism, and will never let a client leave her chair unless they are 100% satisfied. Monica is also highly skilled in styling curly hair, from ultra smooth straight finishes to enhancing the natural curl you were born with! Monica is always striving to perfect her craft through continuing education, and moved to Cobalt Salon & Gallery to further her education in all aspects of color application, formulation, and corrective color work. She has since moved to Great Clips in Vacaville.
