Also known as the Campus Salvage yard, the Monitor Graveyard is a fenced off area always has at least two open entrances.  It is located south of the Bargain Barn and north of the lodge (which is at the Arboretum).  All metal, electronic related items, and anything that the campus at one point or another valued goes there as their last stop before being tossed.  This includes computers, monitors aplenty (hence the name), books from the libraries (usually uninteresting things like surveys of groundwater from 1956), desks, VCRs, tape decks and other large equipment that does strange things and is for the most part  very broken.  There is often broken glass there and there are signs that warn of toxic contamination on site.  Much caution is emphasized strongly.

Here is an example of hardware that ends up at the monitor graveyard:


Security

In Summer of 2004, two Surveillance Cameras were installed.  These are identical to a model that was installed in the Cuarto dorms (Specifically, the Emerson building although there may be other installations).  It is conjectured that there is no night vision or audio feed on these cameras.  However, it is unknown as to where they feed to and how closely monitored they are.  Their resolution, quality, and frame rate is also unknown.  However, police do frequent the site during the night and it is occupied on the weekdays from at least 4 am to 2 am daily and also often on the weekend at unpredictable hours.

In Fall of 2004, a new large fence with a concrete reinforced base was installed around the main dumpster area on the site which includes the location of the monitors.  This was to replace a temporary fence that previously allowed easy access.  Shortly thereafter, the dumpsters which used to be easy to climb into, were replaced with taller, more secure dumpsters that were significantly more difficult to get into.

In February 2005, a comrade claims to have passed by the parking lot across the way at about 4:00 AM.  He noticed two police cars facing the entrance to the bargain barn, and  hence, one of the entrances to the monitor graveyard.  They were sitting there, just watching.  He watched them watch for over 30 minutes.  It appears that at various times the graveyard has been put under human surveillance.  This has prompted a reassesment the quality of the cameras.

If it is indeed the same camera setup as the Student housing cameras (all buildings have at least one somewhere) they feed to a remote server on campus, do have night vision, but do not have an audio feed. I work maintenance for housing and can personally attest to this.
