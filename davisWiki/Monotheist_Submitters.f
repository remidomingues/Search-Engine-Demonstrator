3:67 Abraham was neither Jewish, nor Christian; he was a Monotheist Submitter. He never was an idol worshiper.

The worship of God alone supported by the first physical evidence. Monotheist Submitters, or simply Submitters, emphasize the aspects of strict monotheism. This means that all worship and practice be channeled toward a single supreme being, namely, God. This is in contrast with other religious doctrines which emphasize heavily on the reverence of their founders and/or religious scholars. Such examples can be seen with Christians and the worship of Jesus, as well as with Muslims and their overemphasis and devotion to Muhammed. While maintaining belief in religious texts, Submitters differ with other religious groups in that they devote all practices and worship to God alone.

6:161 Say, My Lord has guided me in a straight pathâ€”the perfect religion of Abraham, monotheism. He never was an idol worshiper.
6:162 Say, My Contact Prayers (Salat), my worship practices, my life and my death, are all devoted absolutely to GOD alone, the Lord of the universe.
