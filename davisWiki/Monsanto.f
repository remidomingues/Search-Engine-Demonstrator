http://www.monsanto.com/ Monsanto is a multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation; they make GMOs, among other products.  It is headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri.

Monsanto has a number of Davisarea connections.  It purchased Calgene LLC in 1996, and the facility is now known as Monsantos Calgene Campus.  Seminis Seminis Vegetable Seed Company, located in Woodland, is also owned by Monsanto.  It has endowed a http://biosci.ucdavis.edu/students/graduate/monsanto_fellowship.html student fellowship fund for graduate students who are preparing for a career in agricultural biotechnology.  http://www.sacbee.com/static/live/news/projects/biotech/c3_1.html This SacBee article seeks to uncover connections between UC Davis and Monsanto (and other biotechnology companies) more generally, noting that documents detailing the relationship are scattered widely across campus and sometimes missing entirely.

His article also touches on the difference between the Calgene of the past and the Monsanto of the present.

In August 2013, Monsanto opened up a facility in Woodland, employing 250 fulltime workers and 150 contract seasonal employees.  According to http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/plantingthefuturemonsantoopenshugewoodlandlab/ this Enterprise article, their main focus will be on conventional breeding techniques of more than 20 kinds of vegetables through cross pollination (rather than, say, GMOs).
