Are there any apartments left in Davis that offer monthtomonth Davis Model Lease lease agreements? During the 20052006 lease period, I lived at Tanglewood apartments and was offered a possible month based lease for higher rent. Is there any other location in Davis that maintains these oddities of leasing periods, or is a temporary Davis Visitors Guide visitor banished to Craigslist craigslist.org?

  Work is in progress on making a complete list of apartments that offer monthly leases on the /talk page.  If you have a few minutes to spare during business hours, consider dropping by that page and calling to check with a couple of the apartments on the checklist.  Have a look at that page before calling around, just to make sure we arent harassing apartments that have already answered the question!

20080528 09:54:20 nbsp A couple years ago (I think in 2006?) I did extensive research on apartments in Davis and found several that were monthtomonth. Therefore I know they exist(ed?) but unfortunately I lost all my notes :( So Im not of any help except to say that at least up until 2006 there were monthtomonth leases available, especially for affordable housing (lowincome). I think that there are apartment complexes that offer year long leases normally, but for affordable housing its monthtomonth... I want to say Sharps and Flats participates in this.  Users/ElleWeber

20100406 21:37:55 nbsp An enterprising editor could start calling around to some of the Apartments in town and asking about their policies.  I know that some places (in other towns) that normally only do yearlong leases will fill in empty apartments with shorter term leases.  I dont know if Ill have a chance in the next few days, but Ill try to get to it soon.  A yes and a no list of verified apartments would be good, to prevent duplication of efforts, if for no other reason.
