20080402 20:08:28 nbsp Hello? Theres something called ROOMMATES...

Think before you post  Dont make a fool of yourself :) Users/MooMoo

20080403 10:45:48 nbsp Hey, dont worry about it  you and Amy are sharing the same Comcast IP address which appears to be a home address.  One is a real name and one isnt.  It is pretty common for people to try hijinks using multiple accounts, like business owners making multiple fake reviews, so the wiki community tends to watch out for it.  Its not a big deal, just odd timing that made it look like you two were one person trying to pull a fast one.  Welcome to the wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for your reviews, and sorry about the confusion!  Tell us a bit about yourself... its hard to accuse somebody of being a sockpuppet if you know who they are.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
