Sept. 28, 2006, at approx 9:40 am PST, behind The Silo Silo, a friendly Asian girl approached people to collect money for a charity called IRFF.  She presented a colorful marketing and identification information on a flipable clipboard, complete with pictures of sad kids.  Laptop handy, I googled them to check their legitimacy.  Sure enough, it was a charity associated with the Unification Church (aka Sun Myung Moon following called wiki:WikiPedia:Moonies Moonies).
