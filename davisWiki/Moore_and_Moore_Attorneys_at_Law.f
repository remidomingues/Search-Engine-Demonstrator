20101114 11:50:24 nbsp I have consulted with Raphael before and found him to be very knowledgeable on a range of businessrelated topics.  The thing I like most is that he doesnt just tell you the facts, he explains what it means to the reallife running of your business as a whole.  I would recommend him highly. Users/PatesBaroni

20110204 22:27:16 nbsp Ive been meaning to post here for quite a while. Raphael Moore was extremely helpful with a complicated immigration issue. He patiently explained the process, the office staff was efficient and friendly, and as the months went by they nudged things along with gentle reminders. When part of the process fell through they  get this!  refunded that portion of the fees. Overall I highly recommend Raphael and commend the office staff. He also happens to be a http://hector.ucdavis.edu/UCDSO/01Current0708/Personnel0708/MooreRaphael.htm symphony violinist.  Users/DonShor
