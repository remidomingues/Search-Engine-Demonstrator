Moose is a drinking games drinking game.

 Materials 

  An ice cube tray
  A quarter

 Rules 

  First, players must designate which side of the ice cube tray is take a drink side and give out a drink drink side (divide it hotdog style...not hamburger).
  Players take turns bouncing the quarter off the table and into the ice cube holders. Depending on which side the quarter lands on, they either give out or take a drink. The number of drinks is determined by how far away the cube holder is (i.e. if its 5 down, then you give/take 5 drinks).
  If the player makes a quarter in the last cube holder then all players must throw up horns and shout moose. The last player to show horns and scream yell moose must finish their drink.


Sometimes during moose players can get frustrated at their drunk drunken fellow players who cant seem to bounce a quarter in the tray for the life of them... as the two former SOS officers depicted here.

  Sometimes, if somebody is having really bad luck, the five tries rule in invoked, meaning that if you truly cannot get the quarter in the tray after five attempts, then it goes to the next person.
