20081201 12:53:59 nbsp Howdy! Its perfectly fine for more than one user (and more than one user account) to be on the same computer. It only becomes a problem when one person is trying to pose as more than one person, which is not the case from what Ive heard. Users/JoePomidor

20081201 16:10:02 nbsp regarding the sock puppet that comment was not added by me, but my sister (and I didnt know about it). we both use the same computer... also we have about four other people who share the pc with us... so are they not allowed on there either? this is really stupid. I did delete my sisters comment. she was just trying to lighten my mood after people having barked at me.  Users/Moozhan

20081201 18:14:36 nbsp Hello, in response to your comment regarding ice cream flavors, I know that there are additional flavors in the back.  However, several times I have come to the north Davis location and popular flavors like pecan praline, quarterback crunch, etc were out.  I always ask if a flavor is available, and I never assume that because the carton is empty that there is no more in the back.  Each time, I was told they ran out...so its not that you didnt order them, you ran out.  I really dont care that much, as I have plenty of favorites, but in your comment on the wiki page, you clearly said we are not (and will never be) out of ice cream flavors.  That is completely untrue, or at least has been up until a couple of weeks ago, and that bothered me.
Also, the downtown store carries Oregon blackberry, and I have never been able to get it in north Davis...once I was even told they dont carry it. Users/kestrel
