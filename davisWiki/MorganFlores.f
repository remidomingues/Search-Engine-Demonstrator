Morgan Flores:


 I have lived in Davis several times throughout my life. The first time was when my mother attended UC Davis while I was in elementary school, between the years of 19891992, which were the 3rd through 5th grades for me. During that time, I attended Valley Oak Elementary School. For 6th grade, my family and I moved to a suburb of Sacramento, which is where I attended 6th grade through high school graduation. The fall of 1999, I returned back to Davis to attend UC Davis myself. This second time I lived in Davis lasted between the years of 19992006. There were about 68 months in there that I left Davis, living in San Francisco and Dallas, Texas for personal and family reasons.

 During my college years in Davis, I worked as a student videographer at Mediaworks and also served a few different positions at Davis Community Television.

 I graduated from UC Davis in 2006, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Women & Gender Studies, with a minor in Sexuality Studies. After I graduated, I briefly moved to Sacramento, and then to San Francisco, which is where I resided from December of 2006 to January 2011. During that time, I worked in the Produce Department of a WorkerOwned Organic NonGMO Grocery Cooperative, called Rainbow Grocery. In February of 2011, I moved to Fairfield, Iowa to begin university studies once again at the Maharishi University of Management which can be found at the following link: http://www.mum.edu/index.html. I am studying to receive my second bachelors in Sustainable Living http://sustainableliving.mum.edu/ .

 I continue to feel an immense draw to Davis, California. Though I dont consider myself having only one hometown, I definitely consider Davis to be one of my hometowns. I visit as often as I can, being that it is very accessible by public transportation. A very wonderful Amtrak Station is conveniently located in Downtown Davis. While I lived in San Francisco, I could easily ride my bike to a BART Station and bring my bike with me right onto a train at the Richmond Amtrak station. Being that Davis is the most bikefriendly town Ive ever visited, I could basically ride my bike right off the train and join right in with the collective bike culture!

20061006 05:48:21 nbsp I never said the Name Debate page wasnt a good entry... I dont like any debate entry, but Im happy to simply ignore them.  I wasnt slamming the Name Debate page, simply saying Hey, I dont care about the Name Debate, but boy, this is a really good idea for a new entry.  As in I dont care why this entry exists  for any reason, its a great new entry. Users/JabberWokky

20061006 05:54:54 nbsp Ah, looking up my exact comment, I see the confusion.  I was referring to the actual debate itself when I said Who care about some Name Debate, this is a neat page, as in Regardless whether or not you care about the debate over the name, this is a neat idea for a new entry.  Although the comment was written in a little itty bitty box and was a quick comment.  :)  No offense to the debate  if I really cared about an entry, I tend to post to it.  I just happen to think that debating nonwiki specific topics on the Wiki is just a shade more effective than trying to wash your car by posting to livejournal.  That said, some people seem to enjoy debating on the wiki... not my thing, but the Houses entry is a fantastic idea that I do like. Users/JabberWokky
