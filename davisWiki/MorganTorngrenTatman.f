Morgan also likes music,  he used to be found djing at the Delta of Venus during Happy Hour. His musical tastes are strongly influenced by Dj Nix of KDVS http://www.kdvs.org/. Morgan used to work at Farmers Market http://www.californiagrown.com selling strawberries for Mehl Berry Farms. He is a student at UC Davis and studies Community and Regional Development. He was volunteer at the Bike Church. Now Morgan lives and works in the great white Pacific North West, where he still bicycles but misses the Central Valleys diversity and produce. He misses his friends from Davis dearly and encourages them to come to Pedalpalloza. http://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza/index.shtml
