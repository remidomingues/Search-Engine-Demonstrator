Mori Seiki is a Japan Japanese manufacturing company of precision machines, most of which would seem pretty mysterious to those of us without engineering backgrounds. In addition to the DTL Corporation Digital Technology Laboratory that already exists in Davis, the companys first North American factory is currently under construction here, to be completed in 2012. It is estimated that the factory will employ between 100 and 150 people. The existing DTL , which will be next door, was one of the reasons that they wanted to located in Davis; the company thought that it would be useful for its designers to be able to actually see the products being manufactured.  Another reason was the proximity of UC Davis, from whence they hope to draw interns and employees.  This expansion will make Mori Seiki one of the largest employers in Davis.

Beginning on September 12, 2011, morning commuters heading into Sacramento have frequently observed between one and four people on the Dave Pelz Bike Overpass of I80 Protests holding a banner with the vague wording, Mori Seiki hurts our community. Shame on them!  On September 27 one of the protesters was decked out in a grim reaper costume, scythe and all.

Those protesters are Sacramentoarea Carpenters Local Union 46. They say that although Mori Seiki will indeed create jobs in Davis, they are actually hindering economic recovery by participating in a race to the bottom as far as paying subcontractors goes. Heres a http://davis.patch.com/articles/grimreaperoveri80unionprotestsmoriseikiplantconstruction/ news story with video and a quote from the unions protest flier:

Mori Seiki hurts our community by not requiring area standard wages and benefits to be paid and by not requiring apprenticeship and journeyman upgrade training which benefits the construction trade and the community as a whole.



  Sacramento Carpenters Union appears to be unhappy that Mori Seiki didnt hire a construction company that pays prevailing wages.  users/jimstewart
