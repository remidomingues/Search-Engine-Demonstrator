Mormon Helping Hands is a nationwide service project put on by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints.  The local branch, called the Woodland stake, consists of eight Mormon congregations in Davis, Woodland, Winters, and Dixon.  They have an annual service day during which Volunteer Opportunities volunteers help needful groups in the community.  You dont need to be associated with the church to join in!

In their words, As missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints we LOVE to serve the community and people in ANY way we can. We would love to help you clean your yard, help you move, wash your car, fix your bike, and anything else that you need help with! There are about 25 missionaries in the Davis area and depending on how many hands you need, they can all be there with enough notice! Again this could be personal OR community service.

You can get a hold of us through facebook: Elder Bryson Haynie, Elder Jason Tooley or through our phone: 530 848 3387

We will be meeting at the LDS church building in Winters at 8am. Due to limited parking, we are encouraged to car pool and shuttle from the church building to the service project site.

The service project will be along Putah Creek Road, a couple blocks south of the citys downtown. Click here for map: http://g.co/maps/k85ja

Projects will include trash cleanup, brush removal, mulching, blackberry bush pruning and work in the community gardens. A smaller group will be assigned to Dry Creek for planting, fencing, and irrigation work.

The Putah Creek Council has asked that we preregister our families using their online registration form at http://​www.putahcreekcouncil.org/​civicrm/event/​info?id171&reset1 .

A BBQ lunch with hot dogs, chips, salads and drinks will be provided back at the chapel beginning at 11am.

Please bring any gloves, rakes, shovels, loppers, pruners and wheelbarrels if you have them.

We hope to see you there!

 2011 
On April 30, 2011, volunteers performed a variety of landscape maintenance projects at Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School, Mace Ranch Community Park Habitat Area, Arroyo Park, and The Farmhouse.  Don Saylor helped at The Farmhouse, and Lois Wolk and Dan Wolk planned to attend, but were unable to make it when Dans wife went into labor and gave birth that morning.

 2010 
In 2010, more than 400 volunteers fixed up eight parks in Woodland, including painting the historic Opera House.
