20051229 08:54:41 nbsp Decent food, but not spectacular  not worth the cost, in my opinion.  Restaurant is on the third floor, so be prepared to walk up a lot of stairs (or just take the elevator).  The seating is tight, but service is always excellent. Users/AlexPomeranz

20061002 16:02:05 nbsp The food is excellent, extensive menu, fairly high prices but 4.5 star. Lots of stairs  but its good for you. Users/AaronDarling

20061002 17:09:17 nbsp This may have been luck of the draw, but I had one of the best wine pairings at the suggestion of one of the waiters at Morrisons! And where else in the area are you gonna find lobster... not surf & turf, but lobster with loads of arteryclogging antiDavis butter! Users/AlphaDog

20100126 18:48:11 nbsp Looking forward to trying this place for our first married valentines day.  Moxie was already booked up, which is a bummer, but itll be fun to try out a new, tasty place.  Doesnt hurt that its a little closer! Users/TomGarberson

20100126 18:57:49 nbsp Morrisons is a great restaurant and in woodland, the ambiance is 2nd to none.  Its a lot of fun for a romantic evening, and the food is usually quite good.  It isnt cheap, but the prices arent crazy like high end dining in Sacramento can be. Users/rfrazier

20100215 10:48:21 nbsp So, we went there last night for Valentines Day.  Really great atmosphere.  The building is beautiful, and tastefully decorated.  They used paper place mats, which was a little surprising at a nice restaurant.

Service: B; Service wasnt terrible, but it was subpar for nice, fairly pricey restaurant.  Everyone was extremely friendly and professional.  They only came around about twice to refill water during the meal, though.  On the plus side, they came by 3 times after the meal, in the 5 or 10 minutes before we left.  They were also a little slow coming by to take our order.  Im not sure on time frame, but we had already perused the whole menu (including a page of nice Valentines Day specials) by the time our waitress came to ask if wed like to start with some drinks.  I also didnt get a steak knife with my prime rib, which was a little peculiar.  No one on the staff came by until I was more than halfway done with it, so I didnt bother to ask for one.

Food: B The food was really tasty.  Bekka ordered a berry baby salad with bleu cheese, blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries, mixed baby greens, and a really nice balsamic vinaigrette.  I started with their crab cake and rock shrimp.  The crab cake was absolutely delicious, one of the best Ive had, but the rock shrimp were basically just popcorn shrimp.  If theyd served it with cocktail sauce instead of a nice red pepper aioli, the shrimp could have been from any pub or bar.

My wife ordered crabstuffed salmon with a creamy lemondill sauce.  It was served with some asparagus and longgrain rice.  The rice and asparagus seemed rather uninteresting, but the salmon was absolutely divine.  It was perfectly cooked, incredibly tender and delicious, and the sauce complemented it perfectly.  The crab stuffed inside was excellentthat beautiful, strong dungeness taste.  If the sides had been a little better, it would have been the perfect entree.

I got the prime rib, medium rare, which I wouldnt order again.  Dont get me wrong, it tasted good.  But it came out medium, maybe even halfway to mediumwell.  The meat was tasty, but it had no seasonings; even the outer edge didnt have any signs of a dry rub or marinade.  It was served with a tasty horseradish sauce, but no au jus or anything of the sorta bummer, since it was cooked quite a bit more than I like.  Unlike Bekkas salmon, my prime rib came with great sides.  Instead of a baked potato, they give you potatoes gratin.  Im normally not a big fan, and meant to ask for a baked potato instead (they note on the menu that you can request one), but I forgot.  It ended up being delicious.  It also came with a generous portion of roasted veggies  carrots, zucchini, broccoli, red bell peppers, onions.  They were lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Its rare to find a roasted veggie mix where the carrots are fully cooked and nothing else (especially the broccoli) is over cooked, but they nailed it (Im betting they par boiled the carrots before hand).

Presentation on the food was very simple, but I generally prefer it that way.

Wine list: B+; The list is moderate in size, but it had a great range of options.  There are a lot of bottles for $30 and under (most of them, actually).  No wine by the glass that I saw, but they do have half bottles.  The thing that bumped them up to a B+ is the fact that they have a 2005 http://www.hallwines.com/home Hall (note: not Robert Hall) Cabernet Sauvignon, one of my alltime favorites, for $32.

Bottom Line: Morrisons is a nice place, but for a total of $96 for two people before tip, theres definitely better in the area.  I recommend wiki:Sacramento:Moxie if you want significantly better food and service, with equally good atmosphere.Users/TomGarberson
