Mortal Forever is a Music Scene local band that performs BlackMetal/Progressive/Hardcore music.


History
Summer of 2005
The band is established during the hot summer of 2005, originally named Revelations”. Starting with James Blake, Anthony Nelson and Cody Craven . James Blake and Cody Craven late left the band. Leaving Anthony to create a new line up, witch later evolved into today’s members.

Summer of 2006

Having fired DeMarini for his erratic drug abuse, and lack of talent on instruments, Stone and Nelson continued to have random practices and songwriting sessions, sometimes accompanied by exbassist Provost.

Summer of 2007

In May 2007 Jackson Jordan replaced Evan Provost.

2007Present

During the 20072008 school year, the band decided it was time for some changes. They recruited exguitarist Alex DeMarini to play keyboards. When they realized he had no talent, they tried him out as vocalist. He was sufficient, and has held the position respectively since. The band then played a show at On The Y in Sacramento in early 2008. After the show, the band realized that they needed a lead guitarist to play more intricate solos, and for rhythm portions. After searching for an hour, they agreed on Nelsons classmate Paul (last name unknown). From there on, they have held this lineup for several months, and appears to be a solid one.

Current Members

Anthony Nelson (Lord Nelson)

Anthony began playing drums when he was 11 years old. During, a live performance in early 2008, Nelsons blast beat skills reached such a high level, that several female audiencemembers simultaneously had orgasms, and had to lie down so that they didnt pass out. Lord Marco(ex drummer for Brian Drill) has stated that Nelson is The #1 Davis Fan.

Tommy Stone

Tommy Stone is an accomplished guitarist from Sacramento. He attends Jesuit School in Sac, and spends his weekends listening to Death Cab For Cutie, and watching Zombie movies.

Jackson Jordan

Jackson is the oldest member of the band, being 18. He is constantly bothered by his bandmates for tobacco products, rides in his Volvo, and job interviews. He also works for the City. Jackson says.  Its money in my pocket. Jackson also plays bass for local dancefolkpunk band Sterling Riot.

Alex DeMarini

Alex plays guitar, slide guitar, bass, piano, guitar hero, and drums, and is currently employed as vocalist. He has been known to be completely insane, and is also know for his sexual promiscuity and outofcontrol substance abuse. He was arrested in April 2007 for smoking marijuana at a skate park by his school during the school lunch hour. He completed his mandatory drug testing and community service on October 30th, and celebrated the next day on Halloween by getting high and eating candy, thus showing his unwillingness to change his ways. By 2008, he had simultaneously become a meth/crack/opium addict, and still is to this day.

Roberto Avena

Roberto joined the band after Pauls departure. Known for having Mexican license plates, Roberto was considered to be the fastest guitarist and easiest member of the band to get along with, since it was impossible to argue with someone who did not speak English. Roberto was too likable to kick out. Robertos favorite album by Opeth is Blackwater Park

 When it gets a photo, I think it might need to go up as a featured entry.  For that matter, so should many of the bands. Users/JabberWokky
 Well, it was the funniest Davis Wiki page.  Now its just another vanilla PCcorrect page Users/JimStewart
   Yeah... what the hell happened?  The writing http://daviswiki.org/Mortal_Forever?actionrecall&version9 used to be witty and amusing.  Now its just a dry history of the band.  The old writeup made me want to give them a listen. Users/JabberWokky
