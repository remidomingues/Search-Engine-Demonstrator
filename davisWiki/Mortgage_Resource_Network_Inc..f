Mortgage Resource Network, Cara Mengali specifically, are the people you want on your side.  I shopped interest rates, and they were all comparable.  There were times I thought I should just go with my regular bank, it would be so much easier.  Well, in retrospect, it would not have been easier, and I was so glad I made the decision to work with Cara.  She was flexible, consultative, LOCAL (which you cant underestimate the value of), friendly and made sure that I felt cared for in every step of the process.  I cant say Id want to fund a mortgage again any time in the near future, but Id work with Mortgage Resource Network again in a heartbeat.  Users/NDS1111

20110323 21:30:10 nbsp I recently used Mortgage Resource Network for a refinance and the whole experience working with a local business was great. Cara Mengali was extremely available throughout the process and kept me consistently informed. The rates were comparable to those at other sources, but the service was far superior. If I ever need to get another home loan, I will do business with Cara Mengali again. Mortgage Resource Network is HIGHLY recommended.  Users/LucyB
