Moshi Moshi is one of the best places in Davis for sushi. Their nigiri and sashimi are some of the freshest available in Davis and are always decently made (rice vinegared well, not packed too hard, not too much rice, dab of wasabi).

They also have some of the best appetizers and special rolls in town. Some dishes, like the Tuna Surfboard and BSC roll, are not commonly found in other sushi restaurants, even outside of Davis. They have a small whiteboard listing their most popular rolls of the month; this is always a good starting point if you want to try new rolls. The Zero Hour ($8.95) is their bestselling roll.  Another favorite is the Diana Roll ($12.95), a yellowtail tuna wrapped up with salmon in a sweet and spicy sauce.

They offer a selection of wellmade warm foods, such as various chicken katsu, tonkatsu, sesame chicken, and beef bentos and bowls. The bentos typically come with miso soup, salad, california rolls or sashimi, rice, and tempura. They also have oyakodon and katsudon, although sometimes these particular offerings turn out unimpressively soupy (try Osaka Sushi for better oyakodon or katsudon). There is a variety of other rice and noodle dishes on the menu.

The waitresses are always friendly, the atmosphere easy and appealing. Pricing is as can be expected from any decent Japanese Food Japanese Restaurants restaurant, but it is not outrageous by any means. For $12.95, you can get the 51, which includes miso soup, salad, five pieces of nigiri sushi (chefs choice), and one maki roll (your choice).  They have also been known to run an insane number of ads in the California Aggie offering 10% off the bill, so keep on the lookout.

20090125 03:25:30 nbsp in my opinon the best sushi restaurant in town. i LOVE their unique Kari and Oh La La roll. TRY IT! the kari roll is fresh assorted sashimi with rice wrapped by some white crunchy sheet. the Oh La La roll is quite simple actaully (CA roll + mango inside topped with salmon sashimi), but the mango definately gives it a refreshing kick! Users/gato

20090313 23:10:18 nbsp I really feel like this place is forgotten about because of its size and location, but its definitley some of the best sushi Ive had in Davis! Users/ladygodiva

20090330 11:41:05 nbsp I love Moshi Moshi.  I have been frequenting this place for at least the last four years, and the quality of the food remains immpecable.  Yes, sometimes the service is slow, and we always joke that a four person lunch at Moshi Moshi requires about 2 hours of your time, but the food is so good, its worth the wait.  One way to get around the slowness is to call your order in ahead of time. Theyll get your order started so that by the time you get in, most of everything is already prepared, and youre eating the moment you sit down.  Take out is another good option as well.  All the people that work there are very nice, accommodating, and friendly.  I love the dressing they use on their salad and often ask for a little side of it to throw over my rice.  Delicious!  I havent eaten a roll I didnt like, the teriyaki chicken bento box is completely worth the $6.50, and the sashimi is well, divine.  Love it. Users/j0liefllle

20090507 16:56:28 nbsp Ive been coming here at least once a week for the past 3+ months.  Their lunch is awesome.  Im the type of person who cares more about quantity than quality, as long as quality isnt horrible.. but if you try their lunch, you get both quantity AND quality.  Their bento box lunches are good because you get several different flavors in one meal: your choice of meat, salad, sashimi or California rolls, bowl of miso soup, and a nice scoop of rice. Like the above commenter said, the dressing they use on the salad is flavorful and makes me want more. If they sold that separately I would definitely purchase it. Things CAN be slow when theyre busy at lunch because they usually have just one person waiting all of the tables, but Ive been through worse so its no biggie.  Just call in your order ahead of time, thats all.  I will be going back for more until the day I leave Davis! {{{d(^_~)z}}} Users/mr.review

20090515 00:30:01 nbsp Went here tonight for the first time.  Prices were quite high, but the atmosphere was great.  It wasnt too busy so service was prompt and the wait short.  I got the dinner combo b.  The quality of food is pretty good and I like how the rolls are prepared fresh.  This place is a pretty good place to eat for special occasions or a night out with a sig. other.   Users/BenLee

20090609 14:17:42 nbsp No doubt very tasty food, and great quality, but for the second time in two weeks, different days, we waited almost 45 minutes for food. Be wary, you may need more than an hour lunch to eat, we had to take ours to go. The waitress was very friendly, and working extremely hard, and we tipped her to show our appreciation, but the owners must realize they need more than one waitress for a full lunch service. Users/Alex

20091206 21:06:15 nbsp one of the more expensive sushi restaurants in davis, but there motto is quality over quantity. i think its pretty safe to say that they have the best sashimi in davis...  Users/betabeta

20091217 20:23:38 nbsp Excellent service. Users/tierramor

20100204 08:51:17 nbsp This place is awful. My sister and I decided to take a chance at a new spot and chose this place for lunch. We ordered a few rolls that seemed to cater to our liking. The rolls were awful, the sauce was just gross. We literally tasted each roll and could not eat anything else. We asked for our check. Had the staff been attentative they would have noticed that we were repulsed by the food, I guess its hard to take care of the ONLY CUSTOMERS IN THE RESTAURANT. I should have just left without paying, but being the good samaritan that I am I paid for the lunch I did not eat. Users/mzp0p

20100205 14:49:02 nbsp I went here with my wife for the first time.  I had heard many good things about this place.  We ordered the spicy tuna surfboard, bloody mary roll, and futomaki roll.  All were very good, the spicy tuna surfboard was spicy tuna on top of a tempura eggplant.  It was very original and interesting.  The blood mary roll was excellent, the hamachi and scallops were of very high quality.  The service was friendly, we asked for a recommendation and she gave honest opinions (I hate it when I ask for a recommendation and the server says something like well do you like fish or chicken?).  I will definitely go here again, the atmosphere is nice but nothing special.  The location is a bit out of the way but it is close to Davis Creamery so desert is an easy choice.  Also you should be warned that the large sake is bigger than most other places. Our dinner:  2 miso soup, wakame salad, large sake, tuna surfboard, bloody mary roll, and futomaki roll came out to about $50 with tax and tip.Users/DagonJones

20100212 14:04:06 nbsp Far from a decent Japanese food place. Went there last weekend and was completely disappointed with the food. Especially with the prices we paid. I tried the tonkatsu which was pretty pathetic. Dont even get me started on the udon! Ive had better packaged udon from the Nugget.  Users/103

20100803 23:29:22 nbsp The price too high,and the food just average, it take too long to have my dinner, not coming back for sure. Users/Willam

20101030 16:04:12 nbsp This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Davis.  Its simple, has the best prices, and its just plain pleasant to eat at.   Users/elgreen

20101030 18:05:31 nbsp This is the best Sashimi and sushi anywhere, there is great staff and nothing is rushed, they take the time to have wonderful presentation too.  i highly recommend Moshi Moshi to friends, and i have wanted to write a review.  i was just there this week and again wonderful lunch.  jamie   Users/JamesMorton

20110302 19:51:00 nbsp Their sushi was okay (i got salmon nigiri) but DO NOT get the udon. They tasted nothing like udon. As for the service, we were the only customers there and the waitress wasnt there and wouldnt pay attention to us. (she was in the kitchen). I didnt even bother complaining about the udon.  Users/littlemissbug

20110306 22:48:28 nbsp Geat service, but surprisingly pricey. Their rolls arent that big compared to the price you pay. That said, their sushi is yummy and its nice to sit at the bar. Users/kthrnngo

20120430 13:09:58 nbsp Oh Moshi Moshi, where have you gone? We used to love this place for great service, prices and food. Now theres only good food and Im afraid one leg of a triangle isnt enough to come back to. Last Friday we went here with a group of four. We sat with no water, no offer of beverages or service for 15 minutes while the two waitresses buzzed around to the other tables. Ever get that feeling that youre invisible? After giving the stink eye to the chef and the other waitress, they got together and realized that each thought the other was taking care of us. Understandable, yes, but there was no Hey could we give you some edamame or appetizer on the house for your wait? only an embarrassed Gee, thanks for your patience. We finally got to order drinks and two orders of edameme 20 minutes after sitting down. 10 minutes later, the drinks and appetizers got to our table. So, I guess you really werent sorry that we got forgotten otherwise you would have made us a priority. This while multiple groups who came in after us were served water and drinks first. The food was pretty good but again the prices have gone up steadily for the past 23 years. Yes, I understand inflation but if youre going to raise prices be sure to give your customers great service. We dont go out to eat often (and especially sushi), so when we do wed like to get good quality and service. Sadly Moshi Moshi is failing behind and well be looking for a new sushi restaurant. Users/DebWestergaard

20120727 16:48:47 nbsp I have only been here for lunch and must say that I have never been disappointed.  The rolls are smaller, but they are so good and fresh.  I actually prefer the smaller bite rolls then the ones that fall apart or that you have to take three or bites to eat. Today our table had the OJ Dragon and Mighty Bob roll.  Both were really good.  But a new favorite is the Tuna Tart appetizer.  Soooo, good.  the service was very good and friendly. Users/LokiAbbi

20120929 21:52:16 nbsp We tried this place recently and are sorry that it has taken us so long to do so!  I think weve found our new favorite sushi place in Davis.  But I would not bother with the chicken/steak teryaki dishes  I thought they were small for the price.   Users/CovertProfessor

20121103 16:27:45 nbsp This place sucks! The price is ridiculous and the food there doesnt worth the price. I tried the beef noodle soup and it was terrible. They charge $1 for a small miso soup, but it s mainly just water. Fujis miso soup is way much better.  If you really want some good Japanese noodle, go to Zen Toro.  Users/JGuan

20131009 nbsp Finally a Japanese restaurant with an actual range of vegetarianfriendly sushi that isnt just inari, tamago, or cucumber+carrots+avocado rolls! I ordered a Midori sushi and thought it was reasonably priced78 rolls for $8.75. Users/michellenguyen
