The Most Hated Person on Campus is an award given out semiannually to a student who runs for Senator in the ASUCD Election.  That candidate may or may not win  but the important part is how many last ranked votes they received in the ASUCD Elections election.  Since the last vote in a senate race will mathematically never be counted, the only reason to rank to the end is just to show someone how much you care.

Note that there is generally no real hatred involved, and the honor can, and usually is, held with pride, especially by people running protest or parody races.

20070224 17:58:55 nbsp DAMN, people! thats harsh! why do you hate me so much? all i was doing was having a little fun... Users/LauraNevins
  Hey, dont sweat it. Its somewhat of an honor, albeit a dubious one. Van Schoelandt was kinda proud of it, in fact. Whatever you do, dont give up. Id like to be able to vote for you again in the fall election. :)  Users/WilliamLewis
  Im saddened that you received the most last place votes  I would have hoped that that status would have been given to one of the fake candidates. :(. I dunno, I guess it might have been the profanity thing, as it offended some. Users/JosephBleckman

20070224 23:03:24 nbsp I didnt place Laura Nevins you last place... since Im not an idiot, everyone else must be an idiot. Users/TusharRawat

20090220 20:22:26 nbsp Whod have thunk that the guy who essentially said rape victims should be more responsible when it comes to not being raped would win this category? Users/MattBlair
