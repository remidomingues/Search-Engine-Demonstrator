Mother & Baby Source carries everything you need for pregnancy and the first two years of parenting. This is a wonderful place to get a unique gift or pick up those harder to find mother and baby products. The store is oriented towards http://www.attachmentparenting.org attachment parenting, and is a good place to find items that may be difficult to find in more mainstream infant supply stores, such as cloth diapers, slings, cosleepers, and breastfeeding supplies.

The store is inviting and nicely laid out, with soft music to sooth children. The back room has a Comfy Chairs comfy couch, changing table stocked with diapers, and a baby scale for weight checks, and is available for baby care when not in use for classes or consultations. Also, theres a small bulletin board where you can advertise stuff like babysitting. The store owner, Lori Rumsey, is very friendly and is a kick to have a conversation with! She recognized me and learned my name after just a couple of times in there.

In addition to infant supplies, the store also offers various classes and support groups on topics such as childbirth education, new parent support, and grandparenting.

Before 2000 they were called MotherSource and they were in a house at 515 G Street, where Downtown Chiropractic is now.

Phils Grill used to be here a long time ago.


20070115 22:49:35 nbsp This store is a great place to look around at. The sales people are very helpful too. One thing they could improve is their collection of nursing wear. As a matter of fact, they only carry one type of nursing top. Id love to see more. Users/RoseNylund

20070307 11:25:55 nbsp My friends with babies rave about this store.  The owner cares so much about her clients  she learns the regulars wants, needs, and preferrences. She helped us pick out baby gifts based on what the mom and/or baby liked! Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20070310 14:11:08 nbsp Lori is the bomb! Users/WhitneyMartinez

20080816 14:52:07 nbsp This store is fantastic. Lori & Ashley know most of their customers by name & their childrens names too! They provide a great play section, a clean bathroom, cool water and a changing table/couch & nursing chair! Their products are top of the line, heavily researched and chosen with TLC. This store is an asset to our downtown and we are lucky to have it. I go nowhere else for my daughters shoes & for gifts. Free giftwrap too! Thanks, Lori! Users/jwendt

20100630 11:30:52 nbsp My wife and I just registered here yesterday and the experience could not have been smoother. We had spent the last few weeks trying to research and hunt down safe, organic products for our coming baby at stores like Amazon and Babys R Us and had difficulty finding the right ones or trusting the reviews. What we realized was that Mother and Baby Source had already done all the research. They only stock the best products, as constatly referred by past customers. That made us feel really secure. The prices werent really as expensive as you might expect for many of the items. Plus, Lori was really helpful showing us around the store and picking out items for the registry. I would HIGHLY recommend registering here if you have one on the way! Users/condemned2bfree

20100630 13:04:01 nbsp I agree with the above comment. The best thing with MBS is the owner and staff have already done the research for the consumers, definitely take away anxiety for many new parents on which products are the best, and most user friendly (not necessary the most expensive, but you pay for what you get, most of the time). Users/LeeY

20100714 11:05:52 nbsp I agree with everything everyone else has said about the store and owners. I just wanted to add that although the store is physically small they had WAY more items and variety then I thought before walking in so it is definitely worth checking out. Just make sure to ask if you dont see an item you want immediately, often it is tucked away somewhere in the store and easy to miss. Also part of the bonus of registering here for us was that we get to pick up all the gifts (already giftwrapped) and bring them to our baby shower so there is none of the cost or extra packaging of shipping stuff.

20110530 21:55:26 nbsp I love this store. The staff go out of their way to help. I find them very helpful and courteous and they provide excellent support (classes etc) for new parents. The store owner stocks specialty baby items including hard to find items and really nice gift items for families who are celebrating a new little family member. If you are an expecting mom or a new mom, the store provides a bunch of classes and information to help guide you through your new experience. But this is not a toy store, they do have a play area in the back (ie. the store has many breakable items) to allow kids to play but I consider it a specialty gift store. I was surprised to see that someone was unhappy. This surprises me because my wife and I have had nothing but excellent friendly service. Thank you Mother and Baby Source for being there for all of us and many thanks to the owner for caring enough to provide us with such great items and such excellent customer service. Users/KyleWong

20110531 14:01:21 nbsp FANTASIC STORE!!!!  Mother and Baby Source is a valuable treasure to our downtown, offering a wide selection of products, services, and classes for babies and parents.  We are very fortunate to have Lori and her knowledgable, friendly, and supportive staff.  The warm, personal services and organic products that they offer are nonexistent at the big box and huge baby stores.  The recent article appearing in The Davis Enterprise singing the welldeserved praises of Mother and Baby Source says it best! http://wwwnew.davisenterprise.com/business/businesscolumns/motherbabysourceistruetoitsname/ Users/TillSey

20110923 08:11:01 nbsp I needed a quick shop to purchase a gift for my first niece and this was the first store to show up. Upon arrival, I was greeted and helped out immediately with the saleswomen showing me various gifts that would be good for a newborn! They were very patient with me as I made my decisions. Once I found my items, they rung them up and giftwrapped my items for free! I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone who needs items for childcare. Users/TiffanySun

20120223 13:41:13 nbsp Amazing customer service! I stopped by to get a baby shower gift for my friend. I had never bought a baby shower gift before (thus had no idea what to get) and Nicole was very helpful and friendly, showing me several great options within my price range. When I picked out my gift, she even wrapped it for me! Overall a very pleasant experience. I am definitely coming back here for all my friends baby showers.  Users/Nerissa

20120509 14:18:52 nbsp Mother and Baby Source is the only establishment in Davis that provides new mothers with advice on everything from baby essentials to pregnancy massage and even has an office for lactation consults. It also has a regular support group for new mothers, which is paramount in helping a new mother adjust to the demands of parenthood while constructing a support network for herself. Because Davis is such a familyoriented community, this store is not a luxury, but a necessity. It deserves everyones support.  Users/CarolinaWonder

20130408 00:12:45 nbsp I love coming to this store and the staff is always very friendly. However, while I understand that they may be limited on space this store is not very stroller friendly! So, if want to take a stroll downtown maybe wear your baby for convenience. Things here a bit pricier than you would find them at big name stores but Im happy supporting this store anyway. Users/RebelYell

20140313 11:49:17 nbsp My wife and I love this store. We are now on our second child and we feel like Mother & Baby Source have helped raise both of them. Its such a Davis kind of store. Not only do they stock the best, most natural products in every category (after doing a lot of research on each); they also know everything about them and will assist you oneonone with any questions you have. Its the kind of place you can just walk in and get an expert opinion on anything kids. They are also networked in with other parenting resources around town, so its like a onestop shop for parents to know what they need to know. Can you tell I REALLY like this place? Well, I do.
