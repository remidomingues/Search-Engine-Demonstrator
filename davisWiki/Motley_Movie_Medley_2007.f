The festival will be a week long event (March 510th 2007) in which 4 feature films will be shown (one every evening). The last day will be dedicated to aspiring student film artists from our very own campus.

• Black Indians: An American Story: In the early days of the Republic, little or no thought was given to people of mixed race. “We were told ‘if you could pass for white, thats who youd be; if not, it was usually better to be identified as black than Indian,’ recalls Executive Producer Steven Heape. It was this kind of thinking that later led to ‘pencil genocide’changing one’s race on a birth certificate to fit the skin color of the child.

Saturday, March 10th: (starting at 6pm not 8pm)
• Student Films: TBA
• Taxi Vala: This experimental documentary explores a complex range of issues within New Yorks growing South Asian communities.
