Hello, my name is Motoki.  I am a recent UC Davis graduate with a B.S. in statistics and applied mathematics.  My main research interests are in mathematical ecology, and hence i am going to the University of Washington for graduate school in Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management.  I especially love my fellow CLIMB members, theyre the coolest kids on the block.
