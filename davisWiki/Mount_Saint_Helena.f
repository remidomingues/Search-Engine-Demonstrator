Mount Saint Helena is in wiki:napa:Robert_Louis_Stevenson_State_Park Robert Louis Stevenson State Park about 2 hours (75 miles) from downtown Davis using the directions below and is just north of the town of Calistoga.  From Davis, the easiest access is to take Russell Boulevard Russell Blvd West where it will become Hwy 128.  Keep going on 128 past Lake Berryessa until you get to Calistoga.  In Calistoga, turn right on Hwy 29 and head up the hill.  Parking for the summit trail is on the right side of the road, at the top of the hill.

The summit Hiking and Backpacking hike is about 11 miles round trip with 2000 feet of elevation gain.  The first mile is on a windy single track trail through the trees.  After the first mile you merge with a fire access road that leads all the way to the top.

The Hiking and Backpacking hike has great views toward the Napa Valley.  If you make it to the top and decide to climb the rickety old communication tower you will have a great 360 degree view.

This area also has some good spots to go Climbing climbing.  One of the good places to climb, The Bubble, hangs over the trail just up the fire road from the merge with the single track.  Hikers often stop there to watch the climbers play.   Other good climbing spots are accessed by bushwhack trails from the fire road near The Bubble.

After the hike, a visit to Mount Saint Helena Breweries Brewery is recommended.  This nice home brewery and restaurants restaurant is located northwest of Mount Saint Helena about 9 miles on Hwy 29 in Middletown.  The beer here is delicious after a day of Hiking and Backpacking hiking and is super cheap.  The food is decent.

20060817 22:15:52 nbsp Ive been climbing here several times, and find it above par.  The approaches are fairly long, but the routes are well bolted.  There are three main areas: The Bubble, The Far Side, and The Bear.  The Far Side is the easiest, but requires top ropes for most routes, the Bubble is fun and is also the easiest to get to, and the Bear has the most well bolted sport climbs, but it is also the hardest Users/PeterAnselmo

20060916 22:08:04 nbsp Are these routes mostly TR, sport, or trad? Does anyone have the guide I can borrow? Users/TomAbeles

20060917 09:00:16 nbsp There is all three available, but it is mostly sport.  A guide entitled The Wine Country Rocks is available at Rocknasium Users/PeterAnselmo
