Even in our city limits (and obviously without a Blue Ridge/Rocky Ridge mountain), mountain Bicycling biking Trials happens. Of course, things are better with a mountain in the mix. Visit the Bicycle Rides page to find a mountain near you.

There is a new local club called Yolo United MountainBikers. The Cal Aggie Cycling Team also encompasses mountain biking. There is also a high school mountain bike team, the http://www.dmbt.org Davis Mountain Bike Team, racing in the http://www.norcalmtb.org NorCal High School Mountain Bike League.
