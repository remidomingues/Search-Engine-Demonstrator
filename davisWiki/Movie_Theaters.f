 Theater Comparison Chart 

Please note that prices are probably not all up to date.


Note: Regal sells tickets through Costco at a discounted price.  These tickets are completely unrestricted  any movie, any time.  They even are accepted for IMAX showings (at the Regal Cinemas Hacienda Crossings in Pleasanton).  They cost $7.50 each, and you can buy as many as you want in multiples of 5. They are significantly cheaper than adult nonmatinee prices.  They are also supposed to be accepted at movie theaters owned by the same family, anything by the Regal Entertainment Group, which includes Regal Cinemas, United Artists Theaters, and Edwards Theaters. (some employees may not be aware of this at the nonRegal Cinema locations, so inform them that these tickets are accepted at all 3 theaters because they are part of the same company).

20110318 16:34:20 nbsp I remember there used to be this one screen theater on E Street I believe, right next to where Watermelon Music is now. It was really grungy, but I saw the first of the Star Wars remasters there. Must have been around 1997 I guess. Anyway, good times, good times... Users/CecilioPadilla
