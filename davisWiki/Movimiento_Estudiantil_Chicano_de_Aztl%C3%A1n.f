20080412 16:45:27 nbsp According to this article, Mecha is a Latino organization. However, in their official documents, they say that they are a Chicano org, and that Chicanos are Indigenous to this continent (i.e. they are Native Americans). So shouldnt Mecha be described as a Native American club/organization? Or have the Mechistas sold out and bought into the whole Latino/Hispanic agenda that tries to deny, hide and downplay the indigenous heritage of Mexicans? On that note, also, what has Mecha ever done to promote indigenous culture and identity? They should be encouraging the Chicano community to learn about their true Anahuaca heritage and history, but I dont ever hear of them doing that. Users/Maitl
  Im not sure that the community at large knows the difference between the connotation of hispanic, latino, chicano, or even Mexican.  I know I cant really tell the difference between the first three.  Maybe you could explain more?  Considering what I know about the Native American/American Indian community, Im somewhat doubtful really sure there actually is a compromise on what those terms actually mean.   Users/BrentLaabs

20081118 20:11:12 nbsp Im not sure who originally wrote this article, nor why they would add the word hispanic into the description, but most Mechistas would know the difference between the terms, and correctly use them. I just edited that term out. The term Latina/o is still left in there because although the papeles do say that it is a Chicano/a movement, we would not exclude anyone who is of our raza from the circle for simply not considering themselves a Chicana/o.  Although most new members eventually turn to the term after learning about and identifying with the term. And for the record we are working on workshops and educationals and other projects incorporating the promotion of our indiginous roots for the community. Users/Lalo
