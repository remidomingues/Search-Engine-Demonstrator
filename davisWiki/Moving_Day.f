Moving Day in Davis is always August 31... the day that nearly every apartments lease in Davis this town expires. Roughly half the undergraduates student population Movers moves to Housing Guide a new home. Many people are stuck with not having a place to move in to until their new lease starts sometimes up to 4 or 5 days later. Every UHaul is spoken for months in advance (get on the willcall lease) by people wanting to move in one trip or simply need a place to store their possessions overnight.  The roads fill with stuffed automobiles.  Sometimes mattresses fall off cars.  Apartments Apartment complexes place giant dumpsters in the parking lot, which are summarily filled by moving students, desperate to lighten their loads. Others in houses abandon goods in overflowing garbage cans, on sidewalks and neighbors lawns. In short a HUGE amount of trash, dejected valuables and stress is created.

Moving day can be a real nightmare. Residents commonly spend two or three days packing, cleaning, and lightening their loads before they even start to move. Great quantities of stress are added to the equation for those who wish to recover their Security Deposit Survey security deposit. Cleaning commonly occurs until the last minute they have to vacate their residence (often midnight 8/31). Requirements for Carpet Cleaning professional carpet cleaning complicate logistics further.

To ease the packing process, a lot of people simply throw stuff out instead of bringing it with them. One day theyll leave a couch on the side of the road only to go searching for a couch for their new housing guide house in a few days. It is not just big items that are wantonly discarded. Many people will throw out things like tea pots and brooms that they will soon have to replace. Added to the nightmare are all of the uncertainties found in moving to a new place. Is that mold toxic?

To Dumpster Diving dumpster divers, of course, its like Christmas. August 30 is Moving Day Eve. As one diver put it, thats when Santa Claus comes around and fills the dumpsters with candy. Class attendance drops by about onethird during Moving Day week which usually happens during the close of Summer Sessions Summer Session II.

      Although dumpster diving can be highly successful in Davis, during moveout time a lot of good, usable material is still ending up in the landfill. To prevent this waste, please donate your unwanted items to a thrift store or local charity instead of throwing them away. Not sure where to take your stuff? See the Recycling and Donation Directory, or the City of Davis http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia to find out how to reuse, donate and recycle over 150 different items.

      If you live in an apartment complex, consider asking your apartment managers to set up a Apartment MoveOut Waste Reduction Program donation station next to the large dumpsters and encourage residents to leave their good, usable items outside the dumpster instead of throwing everything away. That way, more stuff gets reused and less stuff gets trashed. If your managers would like some assistance with setting up a donation station, they can call the City of Davis Public Works Public Works Department (7575686) and the Recycling Program would be happy to give them a hand.


 How to Move 

  Get something to put your stuff in.  Check out the boxes entry for tips on where to get them, but also consider packing up less fragile goods (like clothes and shoes, linens, towels, etc) into large trashbags,
  Pack up your stuff into the boxes or trashbags
  Move your stuff
   if youre lucky enough to have a new place in the same apartment complex, you can probably carry it there in small trips
   for the rest of us we need vehicles to move our stuff:
    cars
    trucks borrowed from friends
    large truck rental rental trucks from places like UHaul or elsewhere
 When you run out of room to take the stuff with you, it falls into the following categories for others:

 The Spoils 

Check the giant dumpsters for finds like:
  Lawn Chairs or wooden chairs
  Cheap bike parts that you can fit onto your bike
  Furniture
  Computers
  Small appliances
  Televisions
  Comfy Chairs Couches/stuffed chairs/dining tables
  Clothing
  Wall Art
  Bed Frames
  Dishes (wash them first!)
  Food
  Free Beer Beer

Those last two, of course, should be closely examined, and only kept if theyre sealed and safelooking.

Beware of sticky things or things with questionable stains!! Dont be ghetto, you dont want that.  Try for collegestudentpoorchicstyle rather than hobothatlicksrocksstyle. Do take second looks at things.

Do not take the term Dumpster Diving dumpster diving literally.  Look before you leap, and all that.  If it smells bad and there doesnt seem to be anything good, move on.

Paying for furniture is lame. Taking advantage of Moving Day to its fullest potential is a good way to Living Cheaply live cheaply.  Its also a good place to find sports equipment for a reincarnation of Office Furniture Olympics.

 Finds 
  Users/RohiniJasavalas apartment has no paidfor furniture.  The couch was off of somebodys porch (taken with permission), the chair was found at the dumpster, the entertainment center was donated by a friend that was moving.
  Users/KarlMogel Once found an awesome locked cedar chest, which after pushing the lock open, contained a matching set of towels and a knit blanket. The only flaw it had was a 1 inch chip on the bottom corner.
  Users/JessicaLuedtke found a working faucet hookup washing machine, perfect for her home with no w/d hookups, along with much other less interesting stuff.
  Users/EricLambden and his roommates found 4 couches, a futonfoldout bed, several padded chairs, several recliners, 3 TVs, a roll of carpet, a boombox, a speakerless stereo, a big oscillating fan, 2 small fans, a BBQ, 2 stools, a coinoperated gumball/candy machine, an empty keg shell, and a park bench; all in good, working condition.
  Users/CarlMcCabe saw a discarded pool table, but sadly didnt have room for it at home and had to leave it...  He was, however, able to take home several desks, a Trek mountain bike (score!),  some bookshelves, and 32 volumes from The Harvard Classics book series (some copyrighted 1937 and others 1969).  Hello Chaucer.
  Users/BrentLaabs et al. have already found a cherrywood dresser, a rather decent couch, two televisions, a set of weights, and various materials that Im planning to use for the next Friends Urging Campus Kindness campaign.  Diving is a perfect way to get around campaign expenditure limits.
  Users/CraigBrozinsky found a box of books 100 feet away from OffCampus Books and promptly sold them for $15, an entertainment center, an office chair, 2 desks, a silverware set, a stock pot, a makeup kit, and a samsonite computer bag.
  Users/JaredTrace found a foosball table in perfect condition; it was only missing the ball.
  Users/JeffreyNonken has found items too numerous to mention (or remember) but some of those he kept include: 3 floor lamps (one of which he repaired with parts from a 4th), 2 rather nice computer desks (one of which he gave to Users/Tarzxf,) a GF3 video card, an external USB drive case missing only a bracket, a DVDROM drive to put into it, swivelly chairs, books, book bag, backpack, a nearly full case of microwave popcorn, more computer parts...
  Users/AlexKou found over 100 restaurant spoons
  Users/JeffTolentino found two lanterns, a camp stove, a scanner, some Mad Magazines and a sweet hat.  He also saw two giant TVs, a lazy boy couch, and some mannequin legs, but left them all as presents for the next pickerupper.
  Users/Flynn found the Holy Grail of Dumpstering some thirtyodd years ago, when he was twelve: A foottall stack of assorted PORN magazines. There may have even been an angelic choir singing at the time.

 Whats the best time and day to find stuff?

 Moving? 
If you are looking to lighten your load, but some of the stuff is in good condition, consider bringing it to R4 Recycling if youre on campus and maybe none of it will have to be thrown away. If you live offcampus, try donating the stuff you dont want. There are several local places that will take your donations. Check out the City of Davis http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia for places to bring your stuff for reuse and recycling. There is also Freecycle DavisFreecycle; although you must become a member in order to post items, it is a handy and orderly way to allow others to reuse your items and, perhaps, for you to pick up an item or two in the future. Reuseits good for the couch, its good for the chair.

As always, instituting a Free Box on your driveway can be one of the easiest ways to get rid of stuff you dont want.
