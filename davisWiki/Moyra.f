Hi there Moyra, Welcome to the Wiki!  I saw your edits about Capay Organic on various pages, and made a wikipage for them.  You might want to take the time to write up a page about this company.  I edited your other comments (such as the ones on Organic). You might want to look at some of the other pages for examples on what to include.  Generally, we shoot for something along the lines of Good Humus this page with pictures and information: its visible, and informational.  Other pages like Eatwell Farm this one are fine too, though I think most people would agree a few pictures help brighten a page up!  You seemed to do fine adding those links to Capay Organic, but if you get stuck, you can always view the How to Edit Help with Editing page.  Users/Edwins ES
