20100121 18:45:55 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Generally pages ending with /Talk are for editors to discuss various edits to the page and not for people to leave comments that will be retained. The goal is to resolve the issue and delete the /Talk page leaving just the base page. Anyway, Introduce yourself and make some additional contributions like adding business reviews, Photo Requests uploading photos, or adding to Seed Pages List pages that need more information.
