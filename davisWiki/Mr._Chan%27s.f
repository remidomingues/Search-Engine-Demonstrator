Mr. Chans permanently closed in Sept/Oct 2006, and has since been replaced by Yummy Guide Cafe.

Mr. Chans is a small fast food restaurant located just off campus near the Death Star. Until 2002(?), Departed Businesses Hong Kong Restaurant occupied the building. The food is features the basics: beef & broccoli, sweet & sour pork, fried rice, chow mein, etc.  However, its inexpensive and the owners are really friendly. Really.

For something quick and filling, this place is okay. Typical cheap Chinese food. Its probably better early in the day, before its been sitting for hours.

So, is there really a Mr. Chan?

This place has an obvious Christian connection: notices on the wall, the Tshirts, the music, the newspapers. They used to play KYMX soft rock but switched to KKFS Christian radio at some point.

Dont mind giving out a ton of personal information to Shadiness Factor shady Credit Cards credit card people? Then you might be able to catch a Free Lunch here when the credit card goonies are out  they often offer a free lunch at Mr. Chans if you agree to sign up for their particular credit card.  Be careful, though.

 Possible Sockpuppets 

It appears that the following six comments are fake, posted by one person (potentially an owner or employee of Mr. Chans, as they note that the credit card company has been changed).  All of them appear to be from new accounts created for this purpose.  If you wish to vouch for any of these, please do so.  ( Note that Matthew Qu has posted a reply below, and these may well be legit ).

   20060501 22:37:03 nbsp The food is great and the service is superb. Cheap and Delicious meals, what more can you ask for? Users/MatthewQu
   20060501 22:42:32 nbsp Great value, considering how much food youre getting for what you pay. You can almost split one combo between two people. More healthy than conventional American fastfood restaurants. Users/AndrewLiu

How facinating that Mr. Chans most positive comments all happen to come at once via several people who just happen to all have one or two of the same IPs.. Users/JosephBleckman
   Different IPs, but yeah... awfully coincidental.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20060501 23:13:57 nbsp And the last 5 comments were also made by brand new users to the Wiki Users/DavisWikiGnome



From Users/JosephBleckmans page:

Its worth noting that in all of the comments, which at surface reading have different writing styles, its is written as its and Ive is written as ive.  Its certainly possible they were all written by different people, but it does not seem very likely.  Users/JosephBleckman

I was the one who noticed them, because they came from the same 23 IP addresses at the same times, with basically the same message in all of them. If anyone is at fault, it is Users/MaxMikalonis Me. However, upon further review of the page, I saw that Users/ChrystoriJohnson has the same IP as Matthew Qu, and Users/KatieMiles with Users/FannyYu. Additionally, the Comments JoesphBleckman removed were only the duplicate Comments added by Users/MatthewQu, and Users/AndrewLiu. On the final note, Users/MatthewQu should not go about deleting other peoples posts and comments about his(or his friends) comments, and that they were legitimately under concern because of the IP addresses, and credit card information. I feel that it is more important to keep the comments of all parties, the support and critcism, and let more people decide, because there is a difference between vouching for comments and Stifling Debate.

20051124 20:03:47 nbsp Im not a big fan, but its good if youre running short on cash and time. Users/ClaytonRehmus

20051124 20:09:08 nbsp I received an afternoon of stomach problems from eating their food... Users/CarlosOverstreet

20051216 10:27:17 nbsp I will never eat here again. I got the worst stomach aches plus more from here. Yes the service is good and its cheap but my stomach and other insides scream NO to me. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060110 18:55:43 nbsp While their fast food offerings can be iffy, their rice combos listed on the whiteboard behind the register are freshly prepared and slightly better tasting. Users/AndrewChen

20060130 13:35:07 nbsp Cheap and fast. But quality is BAAAAAAD. Users/KiwiSelina

20060309 14:58:53 nbsp The one time I went (one being the operative word), the food was very cheap; however, the food was so flavorless and awful that it wasnt even worth the small price I paid.  Ick.  Go to Hoa Viet if you want tasty, inexpensive food close to campus.  (mmmm...Hoa Viet...) Users/JulieEickhof

20060503 21:47:52 nbsp Those 5 comments that were banned were from me and my friends who have ate there and came across this page and decided to support the restaurant. notice the differnt IPs. please put those comments back where they belong because they ARE all made by different people who have ate at the restaurant. Users/MatthewQu
  We respect your right to vouch for these people/IPs, but please do not stiffle the debate over legitimacy at the same time. They may be returned to the comment area in due course. For more of my opinion, look at Users/JosephBleckman my other comments on the matter and Id prefer it if we left Joseph out of this, because it was at My noticing. Thanks. Users/MaxMikalonis
   They arent banned  I know, Im the one who called them out.  If you note, they say that they just appear to be fake, and concludes by asking if you wish to vouch for any of these, please do so.  All of them were posted at almost the same time, all under new accounts, so its reasonable to question if they are real.  Also, none of you have user entries.  Are you students?  Employees of the restaurant?  Owners?  Random people driving through from Reno?  Its not that anybody doubts you personally... its just the sudden appearance of a bunch of new accounts that only post good things to one single entry looks suspicious.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20060816 13:58:58 nbsp If youre not willing to go far off campus, and you want a ridiculously large amount of food for a low price, this is the place.  I went with my vegetarian friend and got a special order vegetarian Ma Po Tofu with half noodles and half rice.  It came out as a mountain of food.  Dont expect much more than a full stomach though. Users/WinstonLee

20061115 22:57:31 nbsp Ive been to Mr. Chan a couple of times and I actually like it. The times that Ive been there, I wouldnt choose the items that were already made and they would make it for me in the back. Maybe thats why my experience was more pleasant than others. Users/LenaLim
