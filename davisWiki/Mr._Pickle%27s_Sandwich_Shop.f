Mr. Pickles is an awesome Sandwiches sandwich shop that has many locations throughout the Sacramento area.  They make big sandwiches that are well priced for what you get. They are located in Oakshade Town Center where Davis Creamery used to be. Mr. Pickles is not a real person, so dont go in there looking for him or youll be in  for some disappointment. The owners of the Mr. Pickles franchise are Frank and Michelle Fagundes. The owners of the Davis location are Bonnie and Mickey Mann, disproving the suspicion that it may in fact be the real Mr. Pickles.  (In contrast, there really is a Mr. Coyote who owns Dos Coyotes).

Sometimes there is a giant dancing pickle out near the intersection and when there isnt there may be an employment opportunity available.

A free cookie is given to those who purchase a sandwich.  A low carb, low fat wrap option is also available. The Tuna Tuna sandwich with everything on a Dutch Crunch roll is over 1500 calories for a mere $7.25. But why stop there? Add in some Baja Sauce, Bacon and extra cheese and you surpass the 2000 calorie mark for under $10.

20130102 12:32:00 nbsp Their sandwhiches are good, but the issue is they dont do assembly line ordering like subway or chipotle.  So, there are two sandwhich makers helping one customer at a time, while the cashier does nothing.  This makes it very difficult to get your order quickly...if there are 2 people ahead of you and 2 up at the sandwhich counter, you are looking at 15 minute wait (compare to probably a 5 minute wait at one of the places I mentioned above) Users/potsie

20130217 12:37:05 nbsp All I have to say is, holy club sandwich! I have yet to order something I dont love from this place. Also, everyone is so friendly  and their catering sandwiches are surprisingly good too! Users/mooodavis

20130430 12:37:05 nbsp Based on my one experience I would say Mr. Pickles makes a decent sandwich that is priced comparably to the Nugget. The Mr. Pickles sandwich was much better than the Got Beef and the Dutch Crunch bread seems to result in more fillings and less bread.Users/MikeyCrews

20131025 12:20:58 nbsp The sandwiches here are really good and they have creative combinations. I love the free cookie and they occasionally have deals like sodas for 99 cents. The only gripe I have is the fact that they close so early so if you eat dinner later than 7 during the week or 5 on weekends, youre outta luck.  Users/KathrynAzarvand
