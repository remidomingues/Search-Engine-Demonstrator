20100712 17:40:52 nbsp  Hi, Im Evan.  Whats with the eNigma?  Are you dressed in spandex, or are you four years old?  Cmon  youre acting like a totally antisocial, petty and juvenile child by introducing yourself as that.  Do you introduce yourself to people youre meeting for a movie as Mr.eNigma?  If so, how do you pronounce the capital N?  Seriously  you seem cool, you write decent reviews, so why are you so aggressive and antagonistic toward your neighbors?
