LYFE SUCKS IF YOURE A B. DESE BIKES ARE DOPE.


Interesting observation.  I find myself to be rather fond of our tiny apiarian fellows.  After all, the lyrics to The Archies 1969 hit would suffer if twere not for the existence of their amber benefaction.  Indeed, the Romans would like as not found themselves remaining a good deal closer to home due to the lack of the preserving power of the nectar necessary to carry the ingredients for their cuisine across the empire.  However, you are correct.  Dese bikes are indubitably dope.  Welcome to the wiki, M. West. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
