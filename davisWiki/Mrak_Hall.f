Several The Eggheads Eggheads are nearby the building. Eye On Mrak (Fatal Laff) sits on the north side of Mrak Hall and keeps the administration in check. See No Evil Hear No Evil are situated playfully in the center of the circle in front of the building. They used to sit in front of King Hall on similar mounds.

As campus tour guides say, Mrak Hall, as is the myth, was named when construction workers, erecting what is now the building as it stands, heard the ducks in the Arboretum vocalizing, Mrak, mrak, mrak. The workers then decided that the structure they were building should be called Mrak Hall.
