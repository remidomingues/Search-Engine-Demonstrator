Muay Thai is a form of martial arts commonly considered as a form of kickboxing from Thailand. In this style, you are allowed to use punches, elbows, knees, and kicks. You might also see some grappling like a GrecoRoman clinch. Along with JiuJitsu, Muay Thai is one of the more popular styles used by modern mixed martial artists.

To be serious in Muay Thai you have to kill the nerves in your shin, as well as micro fracture them tons and tons of times so you can effectively kick shin to shin without having it hurt like the dickens. You probably wont do that

The ARC used to have a Muay Thai program but no longer offers it. When Nova Geração Davis Brazilian JiuJitsu Academy used to be called Elite Instinct, they ran a Muay Thai program as well but stopped offering it sometime in 2010 and has began the program again. Ty Elliot teaches at both the DAC and NG.

Tracys Karate (has closed the Davis Location) teaches shootfighting, a martial art that combines Muay Thai, grappling techniques, and ground work.
