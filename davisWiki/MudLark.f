MudLark is a Davisbased Music Scene acoustic trio creating original folk music, and including Katie Henry, Ray Frank and Laura Sandage. Their rootsy sound features banjo, guitar, string bass and a trio of voices drawing on bluegrass, Appalachian music, folk, country, blues, pop, oldtime, choral and parlor singing. Katie Henry has been called an extraordinarily poetic, musically interesting songwriter as well as musician and singer (Chris Roth, Heartsong Review, 2006) while Sing Out! magazine says Katies highly poetic songs captivate the listener and take them on a remarkable journey of discovery. Ray Frank is a seasoned multiinstrumentalist who works in recording, performing, accompanying, and teaching along the west coast. Laura Sandage has been praised for her strong lyricism and fine musical sense, exhibiting a wide and satisfying breadth of style, from silly to stirring to somber to sensual.
