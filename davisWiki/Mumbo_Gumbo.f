MultiSAMMIE Winning Band.  MultiBest of Sacramento awards.  The band won the SAMMIE award as best Sacramentoarea band for nine consecutive years until they retired from competition so other bands could have a chance to win.  Originally called the Spydels, the band changed its name in 1991 to Mumbo Gumbo to reflect its New Orleans and Carribean musical influences. They have released eight CDs on Ruby Records, a Davisbased record label, including their newest Fun Pac, released in May 2009.

As this  Music Scene bands web page describes the music:

...theres New Orleans second line and rhythm and blues, sure. But also, theres driving rockabilly and country waltzes. Singer/songwriterstyle ballads. Assshaking cumbias. Edgy blues rock. AfroCuban trance singalongs. Congalineinspiring whachamacallits . Mutant gypsy folk.

Mumbo Gumbo plays clubs, fairs, festivals, and nightclubs, and their music was used on a couple of episodes of Northern Exposure.  The band played twice annually at the Palms Playhouse for years and continues that tradition at the Palms in Winters.

The bands founder, Davis resident  Billy Fairfield, puts on the annual Home for the Holidays Christmas music show fundraiser at the Veterans Memorial Theater for the Davis School Arts Program.
