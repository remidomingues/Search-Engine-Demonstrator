http://www.sodexho.ucdavis.edu/dining/offcamp.htm Munch Money is money that you can only use at Sodexho establishments on the UC Davis campus. It is similar to buying prepaid phone minutes or a gift card. The upside is that you dont end up having to pay sales tax on any purchases made with the card, but the downside is that your hardearned money is basically locked up with Sodexho. If youre thinking about purchasing Munch Money, be sure to find out if it expires! Munch Money can be purchased through the Sodexho office in the Segundo Residence Halls Segundo Dining Commons building.
