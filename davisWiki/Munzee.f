Munzee is a scavenger hunt game somewhat similar to geocaching, but instead of making use of caches, the hunted objects are QR codes that are meant to be scanned into the Munzee mobile phones smartphone app. In general, the game is more commercialized and competitive than geocaching. Munzee codes are a bit visually unimpressive and typically not much of a challenge to find, but the experience of capturing them can still be a lot of fun for people looking for an excuse to explore their neighborhoods in a creative way. Players can earn badges, join clans, and level up according to a rpglike system. There are at least a hundred Munzees deployed throughout town, most of which are located in or near Central Davis.

Its like tagging street tagging gone nerdy!
