Muscle Movers were a group of physically fit UC Davis students who spend their summers helping people around the area movers move their belongings. Muscle Movers were best known for their ability to provide their clients with real, muscular men who will work hard to get the job done. Unlike other moving companies, Muscle Movers guarantee all of their movers to be physically fit for the task of moving. In addition, the rates are half of what other moving companies charge (no hidden fees). This moving service does not provide moving trucks, just the muscle and equipment to load/unload ones rental truck. In many cases, clients have found it cheaper to rent a UHaul + muscle movers than to go with a company that provides both truck + mover services.

 Rates 

 There are no extra fees for moving heavier items such as pianos or hot tubs.
