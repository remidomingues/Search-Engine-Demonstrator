 The Muse Matrix 
(TMM) is a nature loving, dancing loving, locally based literary and publishing effort. A consortium one might say that believes in the loving power of critical mass, the green planet, humor and free expression.  Through our publications, we strive toward the revival of love, music and art in a supernatural way.  We consist of muses of all types, and we love all things within nature, know the energies and embrace art, gaming, music and technology.  The muse might be you. You may inspire others or you may have a muse that inspires you!  Artists in all fields, ARE of the highest nature of intelligence. Supported by magical kindred, we aim to share a variety of angles of enlightenment. We are a network.

TMM is duel in its purpose.

The Muse Faire  Back to Concerts for the Homeless

The Muse Matrix also hosts Muse Faires, which is and offshoot from Yasa Gigs in the late 90s that provided free live concerts for the homeless and people who are disabled or blind in Sacramento during Second Saturdays on Del Paso Blvd.  Muse Faires are going back to that original quest and concerts will be both hosted locally and regionally.  In the past Muse Faires have been held at Delta of Venus in downtown Davis. Yasa and The Muse Matrix sincerely wants to thank Lee and Delta of Venus for their most open and unconditional hospitality in providing a space for past Muse Faires.  Lee along with the past band The Free Association will forever rock in our hearts and in the stories of The Muse Matrix and West Coast Musicians Online (WCMO). See you soon at the Delta! Yasa is stopping by for GOOD FOOD   SO, Whats on the horizon for TMM? Muse Faires will continue to highlight handmade multicultural vintage arts and crafts, barter tables, encourage costumes, live bands and song writers to play for those who cant afford to see a major concert. Highlights of the Muse Faires formerly known as Yasa Gigs, include a bartering table where people may exchange items for free, and a running public traveling mural which began in 2001, as well as arts and crafts for children. You never know what to expect when you come to this mini one day get away. Always downhome safe and sane, sometimes hard music, sometimes soft music; Be open and ready to experience your free spirit and what spirit has given you.  The Muse Faires are free All are encouraged to get in the spirit of the Faire for that show.  Presently there are no listings about the fabled Muse Faire on the website, but will be announced in the near future.  The next amazing Muse Faire is set for July 2013. Funding Drive Ahead!
