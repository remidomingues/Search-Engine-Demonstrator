The Museums and Exhibits Museum of Wildlife & Fisheries Biology was established in 1972 to support the teaching and research missions of the Department and of the UC Davis campus. Collections of fish (approx. 2,700 lots, preserved in ETOH), birds (approx. 4,000 study specimens), and mammals (approx. 3,500 study specimens) are maintained by a professional staff and student interns. In addition, the museum houses an inventory of 35mm slides, and a modest text and reprint library on subjects related to vertebrate ecology and taxonomy.

Inquiries regarding the collections can be addressed to Andrew Engilis, Jr, Curator of Collections at aengilisjr@ucdavis.edu.
