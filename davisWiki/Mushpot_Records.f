Mushpot Records is an independent and underground Music Scene music label interested in releasing twee, pop, electronic, IDM, acoustic and lofi artists as well as alternative and themespecific childrens music compilations. Mushpot Records, was inspired by the weekly radio show hosted by Fanny Mcgee and Reverb (aptly named the Mushpot) on KDVS 90.3FM in Davis, CA. The Mushpot broadcasted stories for all ages as well as new underground music from January 2003 to June 2006. For the 2005 KDVS fundraiser, Fanny decided to make a childrens music compilation. Musician friends from around Davis, CA and as far as Japan submitted tracks. Releases are as small as limited press of 50 or as many as 1000. Compilations are donated to schools and radio stations. Remaining proceeds go to the next themed compilation or project.

The Mushpots first goal is to have fun, we are not here to make money! Second, to expose subgenres of music to children without being cheesy or mitigating educational messages. Third, to inspire artists to step outside their normal musical bounds with exciting themed compilations. Fourth, to expose audio and visual artists that wouldnt usually be featured in mainstream culture.

20050504 14:36:38 nbsp Maybe this says sometihng about me, but I ran across the mushpot on KDVS and though my first instict was to change the channel, I kept listening and found it fascinating.  Maybe this says something about me!  Users/JaimeRaba

20050504 15:00:22 nbsp Yeah, it says you like good radio : ) Users/EricKlein

20050504 16:21:23 nbsp Babying them?  Why not let kids be kids?  What kind of education are you refering to by the way? Users/GeorgeLewis

20050504 16:28:28 nbsp I dunno, as a kid, I always found most kids stuff insulting. Wee Sing and Rafi gets a little old. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050504 16:29:23 nbsp True, but what kind of stuff is this supposed to teach?  Values?  Chemistry?  Metaphysics?  I am curious. Users/GeorgeLewis

20050504 16:38:36 nbsp Maybe its just supposed to challenge the imagination. The Three Bears is crap compared to something like http://www.josephperry.net/rootabaga/ Rootabaga Stories. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050504 18:20:23 nbsp Well the reason I liked it was because it seemed to be a good deal more better and more interesting (more subversive?  hehe.)  than facile stuff like Wee Sing and Rafi, although I suppose those two have their place. Users/JaimeRaba

20050505 00:14:42 nbsp Well I was wondering what exactly we would be singing to these children...and when i say we, i mean not us, but those people that would be singing.  Yeah, you know what I mean.  What will be sung?  I dont want no damn hippie talk sung to children. Users/GeorgeLewis

20050505 00:41:55 nbsp Hippie Music... What is you opinion of http://www.myspace.com/shelsilverstein Shel Silversteins music? Users/RobRoy

20050505 00:47:16 nbsp Why you so defensive rob? hehehe. Users/GeorgeLewis
