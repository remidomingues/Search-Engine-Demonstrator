Davis, being the home of a worldclass university (UC Davis) has a vibrant music scene. This includes house shows, clubs/bars/cafes, and UC Davis (Technocultural Studies Dept., Music dept., Mondavi Center for the Arts, and the Entertainment Council (studentrun).

Most of the DIYbooked music events in Davis are organized by the freeform community radio station KDVS look for KDVS Presents..., including virtually all shows at the Delta of Venus and freelance house shows and the biannual Operation Restore Maximum Freedom allday festivals, the most ambitious event of its kind anywhere in California north of San Francisco. Nationallevel indie acts are brought to the UC Davis Coffee House or The Pavilion at ARC ARC Pavilion via the ASUCD Entertainment Council. Bill Graham Presents or other professional agencies occasionally provide major or midmajor touring acts at Freeborn Hall. RockBand University presents concerts yearround at various venues featuring bands made up of the local Davis youth.

Because we are close to the bigger city, there is a lot of overlap with the wiki:sacramento:Music Scene Sacramento Music Scene.

There used to be an actual organization known as Davis Music Scene (defunct as of 2007). They organized and fliered for associated bands, and also put on Davis Music Scene shows. They werent all of the Davis Music Scene, but it was convenient for them that their name is so inclusive.
