In the rarely seen, but seen at least once category is the muskrat. This little ball of fur later wandered into the Arboretum arboretum and was seen swimming away quite happily with his or her strong paddlelike tail.

Muskrats have also been seen in the North Davis Pond aka Northstar Park from the overlook and in the park pond.
