20100120 10:07:28 nbsp A belated Welcome to the wiki!  Thank you for confirming the information on the new The Craft of Fo Paws page.  If you can say more about what services the business is currently offering, that would be helpful, too.  I know this is a hard time for everyone who knew Charlene, but even though I didnt know her as well as some, I know she would want the business to carry on taking care of Daviss dogs.
