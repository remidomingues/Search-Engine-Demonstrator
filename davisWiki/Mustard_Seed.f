20130227 16:22:20 nbsp The comments on here are ridiculous. Be kind to people and they will be kind to you. There is no need to be rude to a server, or the owner of a restaurant, just because they are performing a service for pay.
Ive come to the Mustard Seed more than 10 times, am a student, and have felt like Ive been treated and fed extremely all by everyone there. The food is delicious, they have a great wine list, and the atmosphere is unbeatable in Davis, where most restaurants are one big, weird, unattractive room.  Users/GennaY

20130406 21:30:49 nbsp After a 2year hiatus from the Mustard Seed, a group of us went tonight to see how the restaurant is doing under its new ownership. We had a wonderful dinner. The food quality is as good, if not better, than in recent years, and the service was remarkably improved.

Because the ownership has changed and so many of the older reviews were either pro/con the owners, I moved them to archive pages.  Users/ScottLay

20130522 13:20:29 nbsp I decided to try breakfast and ordered the Lemony Ricotta Pancakes with blueberry sauce, poached eggs, and bacon. I really liked the pancakes. The poached eggs were perfect, and the bacon was good. The coffee was also good. The place was empty except for me and some people at another table. I hope they continue serving breakfast. The service and food are high quality. Users/nowhereman

20131003 22:16:48 nbsp Ive had breakfast here several times and left a positive review. This evening I had dinner with three others and was very disappointed. It was quite noisy when we were there because a crew with chain saws were in front of the restaurant cutting and removing a tree that had fallen because of the strong winds. The food and service were satisfactory. Our server Emma was friendly and attentive. We brought two excellent bottles of wine with us to celebrate an occasion.  One of the owners, Lyn, mentioned there would be a $15 corkage fee. I suggested waiving it because of the noise, and she just smiled. At the end of our dinner Emma presented us with a bill that included a corkage fee of $30. I mentioned having been there several times before and wondered if the owners could at least reduce the fee to $15 given the noise. Emma checked and said the owners were adamant about the $30. I wont be back, even for breakfast.  Theyre a little too money hungry for my taste and dont seem to care much about what the customers think. Users/nowhereman
