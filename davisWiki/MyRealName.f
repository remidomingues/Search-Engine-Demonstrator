I would use my real name if this wasnt on the interwebs. As it is, my name is very distinctive, the internet is essentially forever, and what I say here will not grow with who I will become.
That said, I dig Davis, especially the quirks.


Well, Welcome to the Wiki.  Awesome choice of username, and I understand the distinctive name issue.  As far as I can tell, every entry for Brent Laabs on a Google search is about me.  But Ive kind of gone the other way to preserve my anonymity  as of now, I have made 7485 edits to 2931 pages on 61 wikis.  And thats not counting the edits to TV Tropes or Wikipedia.  Good luck finding out anything about me in that haystack. Users/BrentLaabs
