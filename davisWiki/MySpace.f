MySpace is a networking website similar to the Davisspecific site, DavisCoeds.  While Facebook is perhaps the most popular national college networking site, Myspace is popular among Davisites because its access is not restricted to people affiliated with a university or high school.

MySpace is a web service that allows people to connect with other people.  MySpace is known for doing one of two things:  Making ordinary people famous, or making famous people ordinary.  Users can search for friends via email address, real names or display names.  Users create profiles filled with their various intersts, a biography, a selection of their eight favorite MySpace users and who they want to meet.  Also visible on this page are comments left by other MySpace users.

MySpace is also notorious for letting users of the service use arbitrary HTML and CSS in their profiles.  This results in many hardtonavigate profiles (animated backgrounds, crazy colored text), and lots and lots of music embedded in pages.

In July of 2005 MySpace was purchased by News Corp. for $580 million.  News Corp. is, as you may know, the parent company of the New York Post, The Sun, and Fox News Channel.

In 2006, PC World named Myspace as http://pcworld.com/article/id,127116page,7c,sites/article.html #1 of the Worlds 25 Worst Web Sites.  No one was surprised. No one.

20050529 23:42:23 nbsp MySpace has been described as just another way to annoy your friends by my friend Andrew. I find its soso. I keep in touch with my family a little better, my funny cousins have MySpace. But for the most part its just a weird place that people go crazy on. Tom is a douche and edited profiles that stretch out my http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ Firefox window are doubleplusCRAP. I prefer the good ole LiveJournal EL JAY.

20050530 00:13:14 nbsp MySpace sucks. If you venture over there, make sure you put your browser in textonly mode first. Users/JeyKottalam
  Amen to that. If Tom had any sense of decency, hed disallow music and video embedding in profiles. But then he might lose some of the 80%+ of his users that are just idiot teenagers. Does anyone else have issues with MySpace profiles causing browser crashes on an Apple (it happens all the time with both Firefox and Safari)? Despite all this, there are a handful of groups on MySpace that actually engage in thoughtful dialogue on philosophical and other issues. For example, I belong to a fairly thoughtprovoking AnarchoCapitalist group there. Users/RoyWright
  Indeed. Mine (Safari) used to crash a lot, possibly because of one persons moving backround images (the snow falling thing, I think). It also has crashed during the rearrange the top 8 feature.. Users/JosephBleckman
  My Safari browser often hangs. Myspace pages frequently remind my of the early geocities pages, the ones with about 400 animated gifs of that stupid dancing baby. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050821 22:01:18 nbsp DavisCoeds.com is a good alternative to myspace. Users/ScottBiggart

20050822 01:02:58 nbsp Myspace helps me keep track of certain bands that people tell me about.  I wonder if Tom gets recognized often while out in public.  Users/MonikaLin
  yes, he does. (I have a friend who went to school with Tom) Users/DomenicSantangelo
    yeah, in an article about the record company, he said in an interview that he actually gets stopped and asked for autographs rather frequently. Users/norasandstedt norabeth

20060411 03:59:28 nbsp Id just like to point out that the XSS exploit that Samy used to become the most popular man on the internet was actually a problem with Internet Explorer, not MySpace.  MySpace was correctly filtering javascript, IE however was doing stupid things like ignoring newlines in the middle of words (javascript in this case) allowing him to get around the filtering.  The flaw didnt run if you visited MySpace with an alternative browser.  MySpace had to add more filtering as a result of Microsofts code doing stuff it shouldnt have, basically writing a hack to get around a bug in someone elses program.  So its really not fair to blame MySpace for the problem.  Also, Samy is my hero. Users/ZacMorris

20061211 16:25:06 nbsp Yeah, the explanation of the self propagating worm was awesome. Keep in mind face book isnt limited to UC people anymore Users/StevenDaubert

20100728 11:21:48 nbsp The fact that the last comment on this page (before mine) was from nearly four years ago, says a lot about the popularity of MySpace Users/KeithBradnam
