20051121 15:04:27 nbsp Im a fulltime student, only work on campus part time, but I hear a lot about the lack of a pay raise from coworkers and service workers in the VMTH. And yeah I did get a little carried away, eh? heh.  Sorry! Didnt mean to make it feel like I was trying to come down on you or anything. Fees were hard enough before, I just got frustrated and ranted randomly. Users/EdWins ES

20060130 16:22:44 nbsp With an acorn is a mighty oak grown... that Trailer Park page has led to at least three other pages (since it also begged the question of what is that complex between the Arbors and the Trailer Park on Olive).  Cool first entry! Users/JabberWokky

20070119 19:04:57 nbsp I added as much as I can about Grannys store (I found her eBay sellers site), but if you could add a sentence or three about Granny herself it would probably finish off the entry.  You noted that she was nice.  Any other impressions? Users/JabberWokky

20070215 09:18:41 nbsp I rear ended someone once and it wasnt my fault either.  Despite that I always hear if you rear end somebody it is automatically your fault.  In my case the guy had swerved and then slammed on his brakes.  When the police officer asked why he braked, he apparantly said for the stop sign.  The officer looked at him, asked what stop sign?, and pointed down the busy, but sign free street. Users/JabberWokky

20070215 09:21:44 nbsp Yeah it was definitly my fault, I did not break in time. Jabberwokky I will also add more comments about Grannys. What happened to your page? I cant leave a comment Users/MyaBrn

20080215 06:15:36 nbsp everything wants to think they had at least a small effect on their successors Users/fredchen

20080216 11:49:40 nbsp did you read it by itself?

it was in response to your comment Users/fredchen

20080805 18:30:25 nbsp Youre into education? Me too! Your Nestware comment has some rather banal grammar errors. That is, its is a  pronoun, but its means it is; and alot is two words, as in a lot of people cant speak English. Users/onnaca
