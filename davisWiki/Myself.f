20100307 22:04:22 nbsp Hello and welcome to the Wiki! Please consider Importance of Using Your RealName using your real name. Anyway, the budget cuts will be blamed on different people depending on who you ask. If you ask an evil conservative like me, I would blame greedy administrators and politicians who do not have the common sense or courage to push a sustainable budget. You should ask other people for whom they blame, I have a problem with putting words in other peoples mouths. Users/hankim

20100312 17:35:41 nbsp Ive just had the weird experience of talking to Myself, even though I dont exist.  Ive never met Myself, and Im probably nowhere near Myself.  I dont even feel like Im Myself of late even though I know that Im myself, Myself.  But I also know that Im not Myself even when I am myself.  Well, anyway, welcome to the Wiki and dont be afraid to express yourself, Myself... Users/IDoNotExist

20100314 12:01:40 nbsp I missed the Shakespearian reference that Users/IDoNotExist made... where was it? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100314 18:47:19 nbsp Ah, yes!  Im not a literature snob either, but I do love a good reference.  In March 4, 2010 Public Education protest/Talk, I wrote, It might be a good idea to try and learn from this for future topics of acute and emotional importance, as splitting out the rapidly expanding general topic from the specific focus earlier rather than later allows picking out the relevant information, but letting it grow like an untended garden grown to seed, things rank and gross in nature possess it merely, which results in a situation where pruning either runs into great thorns of controversy or loses valuable fruit of discourse.  Gotta love the continued relevance of entertainment written over 400 years ago!  One wonders how well todays entertainment will hold up.  Users/JabberWokky
   I can see it now. Fourhundred years from now... Come at me, bro. Users/hankim
   Oh no, I didnt get either of your references!  Im uncultured!!! Users/Myself
    Heh.  Not getting a reference is never a sin  or even a way to be uncool  in my eyes.  Its from a part of Hamlet often called the first soliloquy: http://www.repeatafterus.com/title.php?i9174  Working with watersheds is really neat, and marks you as awesome in my eyes.  Im from Florida where they accidentally broke half the state a half century ago, trying to do flood control, prevent saltwater intrusion, drain swamps for homes and protect fish, wildlife and the aquifer using the best knowledge of the era, which turned out to be insufficient.   The state is now in the middle of a careful manydecade and multi billion dollar effort to fix the Everglades and South Florida.  Hopefully itll go better this time.
