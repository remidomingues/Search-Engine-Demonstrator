There is a short green belt connecting Mesquite Drive to Fifth Street. The south entrance is across from the Davis Police Department and the north entrance is in front of Homestead Coop.  Almost every day there is some interesting food left on the lawn or area under the trees.  Presumably this food is left by one of the Homestead Coop residents for the squirrels or birds.   Many times the food is appropriate for this purpose such as bread or crackers; however, sometimes there are unusual food items like Ice cream, cottage cheese, and cans of soup. Given the nature of the residents at Homestead Coop it is possible the individual leaving these items has a creative outlook on reality.  Please post any interesting photos of this mysterious food.
