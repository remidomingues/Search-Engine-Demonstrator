20090805 17:48:45 nbsp After reading you inquiry on the wiki in regards to myself as the owner the club. Is a little unfair because first off I do not yell at my employees in front of members. I have respect for my employees. Secondly if regards to billing issues and declines. That is a fee that is billed to me directly. It is ultimately up to the member to update their information, not Peaks. All of my employees have certifications to teach here at Peak. I do not hire anyone that is not certified. I am sorry to say that also the club is very diverse in its members. If you have any questions about the club please email me, I like to take care of issues right of the back.
