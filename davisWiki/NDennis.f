Senior Design and Communication Student at UC Davis UCD. Im enjoying my final year here at Davis.
Im vegan. I want to try out those vegan cupcakes at Let Them Eat Cake on L street, but theyre always sold out before 2pm!?! I like coffeeshops, especially Delta of Venus (good brunch food) and Mischkas. I like shopping at the CoOp as they have everything I want and need, but I enjoy the atmosphere of the Nugget better... Er, I guess now that Im 21, I can go to the bars. Mojito pitchers on Thursdays at Bistro 33 Bistro are pretty bomb...
 I enjoy flying kites (when its windy) and riding around on my rickety old school roadbike/cruiser hybrid that I got from the TAPS auction for $60. I also like walking my doggy around the Greenbelt. She is a 10, almost 11, year old rotty lab, very very cute.
I am originally from LA. You can tell by my vernacular as I do say the 80, not I80... or 80... (its a proper noun). However, I have adopted some NorCal slang much to the chagrin of my socal friends. Okay. BYE.
