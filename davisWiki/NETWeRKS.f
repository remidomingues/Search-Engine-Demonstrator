20110602 20:48:19 nbsp   Andrew worked his magic for our business and home computers.  He solved our virus issues, implemented a plan for us to back up our system regularly and now can help us online any time we need him.  He was thorough, kind, knowledgeable, prompt and flexible.  He was able to work in our busy household and never made us feel like we were asking stupid questions.   Our dollars spent with NETWeRKS was well worth it.  Thank you Andrew!  Users/Alib

20120411 20:57:04 nbsp Andrew is Awesome!!  He quickly diagnosed what was wrong with my laptop and gave me good advice on how to move forward  all at a very, very reasonable price!  He was easy to talk to, flexible and really knows his stuff.  I would highly recommend contacting him if youre having problems with your computer. Users/LizR

20120910 09:55:55 nbsp Andrew has extremely reasonable rates and is really knowledgable, and if he cant do it, he knows just about everyone else in the area who does repair and will give you a referral.  We had a virus on our laptop and Andrew arrived within fifteen minutes of our call and had it back within two days, good as new. Very personable, very informative and highly recommended.

20120927 16:31:40 nbsp Very impressive.  After repairing our laptop for software virus I noticed something wrong in the laptop case.  When I called Andrew he explained that he never opened the case but still offered to come by to look at it.  He came the same day, identified the problem (that was clearly not related to his software fix) and even spent some time to try to fix it.  No charge, and he recommended a place to get it fixed.  Also just a very nice person to work with. Users/ReginaLinville

20121120 11:38:03 nbsp I highly recommend Andrew to take care of your computers. Hes down to earth,very knowledgeable, and honest! Thank you for the excellent service you provide Andrew! Users/JackVanbezooyen

20130114 13:45:50 nbsp Andrew is a true professional and provides excellent service.  I would recommend him without reservation.  He works quickly, but also had the patience to explain things clearly to a nontechie such as me and to work through a unique set of problems I had.  I hope that Davis is lucky enough to have Andrew around for a very long time.  Users/TimGaffaney
