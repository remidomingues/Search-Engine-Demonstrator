 Davis Bowen Therapy

Gabriele Streuer is a NST Bowen Therapist in Davis, California

NST stands for: Neuro Structural Integration Technique. It was developed by Michael NixonLevy out of the work of Tom Bowen, an Osteopath, and other modalities.
It is now widely recognized in Europe, the US and Australia. It aims at integrating the structure of the body by stimulating the nervous system, i.e. the neuromuscular system through a sequence of specialized rolling moves across selected soft tissues throughout the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the body and also upper and lower extremities.

Bowen Therapy is a holistic form of structural bodywork that provides an overall dynamic body balance and integrated body response. Bowen therapy stimulates the bodys own innate healing mechanisms to bring about muscular and skeletal change, resulting in reduction of pain, increase in strength, flexibility and vitality. Since Bowen Therapy addresses the body as a whole unit, the cause of problems rather than just the presenting symptoms, it embraces the physical, chemical, emotional and mental aspects of each person receiving a treatment. Application of the technique can be performed through clothing or directly on the skin. The pressure applied is deemed to be lighter than other forms of comparable therapies, thus making it suitable for most clinical conditions and also for acute conditions, the aged and frail.

Typically treatments are 3050 minutes in duration and generally 23 sessions are required for resolution of common disorders

This work can be performed without the need of disrobing and is generally a very gently and relaxing form of therapy. It has been very effective in a number of different applications:

 	Spinal conditions
 	Cranial conditions
 	Headaches including migraines
 	Neck conditions including whiplash
 	Back conditions including pelvic, lumbar and thoracic
 	Shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand conditions

 	Digestive and intestinal conditions
 	Asthma and other respiratory conditions
 	Arthritis and joint conditions
 	Menstrual, fertility and menopausal conditions

Her touch is confident and intuitive, her personality friendly and welcoming, and her compassion and caring are obvious. I was amazed at the effectiveness of the seeminglysubtle Bowen method. Thank you, Gabi! Users/Laurie
