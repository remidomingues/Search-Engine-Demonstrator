The N Street CoHousing is one of the more interesting community things in Davis. Years ago, about 1012 houses on N Street all agreed to remove their backyard fences to create a private community area. They now have a common house, gardens, chickens, compost piles, a trampoline, and play structures for their children.

They request that prospective visitors contact them before visiting in person  after all, these are their homes.

If you are interested in visiting or living at N Street you can let them know http://www.nstreetcohousing.org/contact here. If just generally interested in cooperative housing, there is also a https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkeydFZibnZBb3BwSUszaXFIOXRxcjVZdlE6MQ&ifq shared applicant pool maintained by the Davis Cooperative Community Network (DCCN).

N Street hosts the Start Cooperative Housing workshops, in collaboration with DCCN.

20110907 13:43:01 nbsp I love the new community exchange (aka free pile) structure and I think its a great idea to keep the items protected.  I heard that the City of Davis is fining you all $500 a day for building it, though!  I wonder if people can get together and ask the city not to do that... Users/SallyHensel
