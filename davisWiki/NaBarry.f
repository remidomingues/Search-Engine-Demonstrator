Note: I no longer use this profile  I created a new profile, Users/NicholasBarry, so I could have a profile that used my whole name, as per wikispot guidelines. (A is my middle initial, thus my old profile name.) I have left everything as is on this profile (except to remove the Comments box). Please visit my new profile!

I studied Economics and International Relations, got a job with http://dist06.casen.govoffice.com/ Senator Darrell Steinberg in Sacramento, and launched the Davis Dollars Davis Dollars community currency.

  Thanks, Jabberwokky! Both for the comment and for the copyediting on the DD page. I did have fun with the old profile page, but felt it had been up for quite some time. Ill probably do something a bit more fun soon, when I get around to it.
