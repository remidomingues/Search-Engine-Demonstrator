Of course there are many more reasons that cant be listed; NAC Ski has a Frequent Rider program that gives you credit for each trip!

In addition, NacSki allows you to purchase rental vouchers and other resort amenities on their website so youre good to go! This is the first year NAC Ski has stopped in Davis; many people were requesting a shuttle that could bring them to Tahoe and back without the hassles of going back to the Bay Area.

Bus trips are 99% always $42 round trip; if you wish to add on a lift ticket and rental, you can do so on the Book Trip section of the website.

For all you Davis people that reside in the Bay Area: NAC Ski originates from the Bay Area. What does that mean? If you wish to go from Davis to your home in the Bay Area, just stay on the NAC Ski bus! Thats right, you can ride the bus all the way back home and arrive no later than 10PM the same day as your Tahoe trip! Keep in mind, the bus stops at designated places and is specific for each individual trip. Should you do this, be prepared to get PICKED UP at the site you decide to drop off at. NAC Ski will not provide you a ride back up to Davis the following day nor will they bring you to any location other than that is listed as a designated dropoff point. Do not bring loads of luggage onto the bus in preparation of going home; the tour lead will stop you if he or she deems what you put on the bus as excessive (In another words, dont abuse this perk). You must be present when placing your belongings in the storage container; NAC Ski is nor responsible for lost items.
