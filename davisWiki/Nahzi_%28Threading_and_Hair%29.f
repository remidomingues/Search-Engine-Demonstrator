20100508 17:49:46 nbsp Nahzi is great! I went to her to get my eyebrows threaded and she did an amazing job! Other places Ive gone to have only spent 510 minutes, but she takes her time and is really good at knowing what shape fits your face.  Users/rlwindmill

20100509 17:15:34 nbsp Nahzi is absolutely wonderful. I get my eyebrows threaded at Exclusives, and I love it. A good friend recommended Nahzi to me after another place completely messed up my eyebrows. My eyebrows were completely uneven and looked terrible, I had no idea what to do. I went to Nahzi and she took the time to measure out the perfect arch for me, as well as let me know what areas to let grow. After just two appointments my eyebrows looked substantially better, and now they are better than they have ever been! She is a miracle worker! Users/kmcwilliams

20100522 09:45:35 nbsp I have been going to Nahzi for over a year now for my eyebrows and haircuts. She is so friendly and her work has always been flawless!!!  Everyone always compliments me on the shape of my eyebrows!!! She threads them for me once every four weeks.  I highly recommend her.  Users/Negin

20100524 16:16:53 nbsp I have been going to Nahzi for over a year now and I love her professional work ethic and positivity. She has provided me with wonderful threading and waxing services and I am always happy with her work. She also styled me and my friends hair for prom and it turned out so amazing! I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for an experienced professional to provide you with flawless work. Shes great!!     Users/Sadaf

20100609 16:59:36 nbsp I have been going to Nahzi for threading for over a year and a half, and she is fabulous!  Another salon (not in Davis) had completely butchered my eyebrows, and Nahzi worked at them meticulously until they made a comeback.  Now they are beautifully shaped.  She always takes her time and does a great job.  I highly recommend her services. Users/gillianc

20100609 20:20:19 nbsp I went to Nahzi today for eyebrow threading, and she did an amazing job.  She has quite a light hand so most of the hand motions felt like a massage.  I will definately be going back to her.  She is also a sweet person, and very easy to talk to. Users/onlyleo

20100807 12:31:08 nbsp I have been going to Nahzi for two years for hair cuts and color.  No one else has gotten it so right so often.  She takes the time to make it perfect.  Shes talented, easy to talk to, and really cares about her clients.  Once you try her, youll never look back.   Users/Carolynmwood

20100808 11:33:00 nbsp Throughout may life I have been to many hair salons in SF and NYC and now Davis.  Nahzi was recommended to me after I grew tired of having my former stylist misstyle my hair and be so rough on my scalp.  Nahzi took the time to ask what I was looking for...she does an excellent job styling and dyeing my hair and she introduced me to the art of threading...she made my eyebrows perfect and I also had her thread my face...much better results than waxing and no breakouts afterword...it stimulates the collagen and gives you the benefit of exfoliation and skin firming immediatelyLOVE IT!  Nahzis calm manner has you on your way looking beautiful and relaxed...and her prices wont make you flinch.   Users/PilarRivera

20101023 10:09:10 nbsp Nahzi,  Just wanted to let you know that you are the best.  I always get compliments about my hair color and cut.  People really need to try your services.  You are extremely knowledgeable in doing hair color to perfection.  Also, to please my cousin is a feat!!  So that again tells, you are the best, because you are first one in California to please her.  Thank you!  M.Jenkins  Users/MariaJenkins

20101105 22:03:32 nbsp Ive been going to Nahzi for eyebrow threading for over a year now.  Even during the 14 months I was working and living in San Antonio,TX Nahzi always took care of me on my trips home.  She is always available to make you look fab. Attention to detail makes Nahzi standout amoung other stylist, she is in a league of her own.  Thank you Nahzi! Users/ShirleyS

20101123 18:29:33 nbsp I love Nahzi!!! I am very very picky about my eyebrows and I always leave happy after my appointment with Nahzi. She really works with you on what kind of look you are trying to accomplish. Plus, Nahzi does not try to rush your appointment (unlike other places I have been to). She is very friendly & professional. I highly recommend her! Users/JessicaJ

20110117 16:06:59 nbsp in my opinion she charged me a lotshe charged me $15 i dont know if its just me. it was a good job but i had done before for a lot less than that. Users/edna5

20110206 11:40:17 nbsp Nahzi is so professional. Im so picky about my eyebrows but she did a great job on them! I highly recommend her. Users/SusanEjlalmaneshan

20111116 15:59:25 nbsp I absolutely LOVE Nahzi! My eyebrows were a mess and shes been diligently working on them for the past few months and theyve never looked better! My favorite thing about Nahzi is that she really takes her time working on your eyebrows never rushing and trying to get you out of there like other threading salons. I would highly recommend Nahzi, she really knows what shes doing and knows exactly what looks good with your face!  Users/FatimaBaig1

20111214 21:59:08 nbsp Nahzi is wonderful she took her time to correct the mistake made by another person that did my eyebrows, helped reshape them, and did an awesome job! I love that she gives a consultation before you start so she knows what you want, gives her recommendations, and you know exactly what will happen. I prefer my eyebrows thicker, more natural, with a slight arch. In the past I had people just rush through, miss hairs, and butcher my poor eyebrows then have me take a look when their already bad; not the case with Nahzi. For Davis she is fairly priced at $15 and it is worth it because your eyebrows are very important to balance your face, and really makes a difference in your confidence when they are well done. I have gotten my eyebrows threaded for $12, but I dont mind paying more when its such a good job. I highly recommend her eyebrow threading services, and you can tell she really cares about the customer looking their best. I will provide an update as soon as I grow out my hair and get a haircut from her. The salon is also nice and clean.....I definitely feel confident going back for a haircut, since she is very meticulous with eyebrows, I have no doubt in her abilities to cut hair (checking around town those prices are better too, and she told me she has over 20 yrs experience). Only thing make sure you bring cash; no credit cards. Just finished my 1st quarter at UC Davis, and being new to the area daviswiki has been a lifesaver in finding these wonderful services.

20120128 13:08:33 nbsp Michellex79 was my user name but cannot remember the password. So here are a few updates:

Got my hair done very satisfied, and thanks to her suggestions on hair products it truly makes my hair healthy and provides essential nutrients it was lacking since it was dry. I received a color/cut, and the hair is very natural brown matching my original, so as it grows I love it more and more. She fixed the layer mistakes from a previous stylist and my hair is great. She recommended several hair products, and these have made my hair look healthy, soft, and the color wonderful. Prices are fair you would have to speak to her depending on what you want, but she is very good at discussing options during your consultation.
Correction on previous cash only statement, she just doesnt accept credit cards as far as forms of payment.
Eyebrows are definitely looking better than when I first started, still a work in progress but I am more impressed every visit. I prefer everything very natural looking and low maintenance, thanks to her techniques I can just comb my hair and go to school without much effort. I use to straighten it which would take long since it has a natural wave, but its not frizzy and so easy to maintain now. Nothing more to say except she is the best in Davis, and makes every effort to make sure you look your best as well. Users/MichelleRx7

20120221 12:35:41 nbsp I went to Nahzi for a haircut. Great service, did a good job,and listened to what I wanted. She explained to me exactly how she was going to cut my hair and in the end it turned out great. I love my new haircut! Users/Krissun

20120314 20:55:16 nbsp I have been going to Nahzi for about two months to get my eyebrows threaded, and she does an amazing job!  She spends a great amount of time with me each visit, and never makes me feel rushed.  Her work is so much nicer than the quickie threading places or any waxing place Ive ever been to.  My eyebrows have looked better every time Ive gone, even though it does take a little bit of time for them to grow enough for her to shape them.  Im very happy I found her, and will keep going back.   Users/BrittanyL

20120428 14:40:14 nbsp Nahzi is amazing! I have been going to her for about two years to get my eyebrows threaded. She is very kind and always spends a lot time making sure the shape of the eyebrow is perfect for your face. She definitely does the best job on my eyebrows of any salon I have every gone to. I am so glad I found her!  Users/rlwindmill

20120506 22:18:44 nbsp Ive been going to Nahzi for threading for over a year now, and she consistently does a great job. I used to get my eyebrows waxed, and after a bad wax job (and some skin issues) I decided to go to her to get my eyebrows threaded for the first time. Shes has a lot of patience, shes sensitive, and Ive always felt that she pays close attention to what shes doing and really wants to make you look good.
In addition, Ive gotten a haircut from her to fix a bad haircut from another stylist and it was very well done! She did an amazing job listening and trying to convey what she was going to do, so theres no surprises.
I go back to her because shes good at listening, shess good and she knows what shes doing, and she does her best to make you look good! And it shows. Users/RachelR

20130220 15:13:33 nbsp Ive been going to Nahzy about 7 months now.  Im the rare hairy Asian woman so even my facial hair is thick and dark.  (If I could afford it, Id do laser removal).  Tried waxing my face last summer and my sensitive skin reacted horribly to the wax, plus my face broke out like crazy.  Was afraid to try anything else, but decided to try threading and picked Nahzy because of these wiki reviews.  She was very gentle, and results were great.  Had a bad hair dye job from another salon so decided to have her try my hair since her reviews were good.  The cut was good and the color was perfect (Id been trying for months with my other stylist and never got the color right).  Shes been doing my hair and face ever since.  Shes very nice, easy to talk to and makes even this hairy beast feel like a girl again.  :) Users/xtine

20140301 11:59:38 nbsp Were sitting here at Nhazis salon and Im watching my mom get threaded. I just had my eyebrows done and I gotta say, Ive honestly never had any eyebrow work done by anyone ever that made me feel as good about my eyebrows as Nhazi has just now. I have arches now! And being in Nhazis company is very comfortable. For as meticulous and attentive she is, its definitely worth the $15! Ill be back before my brows get all furry again! Thanks Nhazi!

20140610 09:49:19 nbsp I recently called Nahzi hoping to get an appointment in later that day, due to a job interview the next day. She was able to squeeze me in at a time that fit my schedule, and did an excellent job threading my eyebrows. Ill be making my appointments with her a regular occurrence, and I definitely recommend her. Users/Killbasa
