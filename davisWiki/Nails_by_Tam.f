20070613 09:25:51 nbsp for a mans haircut, the best in town.  I have lived here for 6 years and this place is the only place I go to now that I have found it.  The guy takes his time and cuts your hair very well.  Plus it is only $9 for a haircut, cant beat that! Users/DanielB

20080109 08:11:47 nbsp Haircuts are $9, as advertised.  They dont wash, dry or style  just spray water and cut, which is why its still $9 for a womans haircut.  I thought he did a good job  I had him take off some length, thin it with a razor, and put a few layers in front.  He cut off more than I expected/asked for, so it might be a good idea to err on the conservative side when saying how many inches you want to trim. Users/ruthelizabeth

20080127 12:23:24 nbsp Got to agree with DanielB, The nice guy who cuts your hair takes his time and does excellent edge work. I have a very simple hair cut just 2 different razor lengths and yet he still takes the time to make sure its completely even. I always walk away with a better haircut than I ever got from supercuts where I usually shell out like 15 bucks for a 3 minute buzz. Thats why I usually leave a $6 tip. Users/ArmyDecoy

20121202 09:46:11 nbsp I went here based on a recommendation from a friend, and I was not disappointed.  Hue did a wonderful job cutting my hair and beard with high attention to detail, and it was very affordable as well.  I really recommend this place. Users/DavidLoyola
