The Naked Lady of Riverside is said to have been a troubled soul who squandered away the latter part of her miserable existence in Davis, California, where she attended college.  Like most Davis visitors, the Naked Lady grew into the town and found it increasingly harder to move on.  She is said to have begun appearing nude in public places shortly after having taken the act of public urination to a competitive level post graduation in the summer of 72.  Biographical research shows a possible connection between the nudity and public urination with NLRs discovery of Davis drug supply. The legends have it that NLRs last appearance was cut short by an unfortunate run in with a crazed pick up driver who made the mistake of reversing while NLR was relieving herself on the rear passenger wheel of the parked vehicle. Both Riverside and Davis mourned the loss.



Does anyone know if this is anything more than an Urban Legends urban legend? Users/JasonAller

Does anyone know anything about a Naked Man of Davis I had my car urinated on and in today, I left the window down cause I was just hopping out for a second.  The piss was all over the door and on my carseat in a very manly urination pattern, disgusting. Users/ChrisWaterstraat
