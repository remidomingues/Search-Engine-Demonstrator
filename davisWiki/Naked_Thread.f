Naked Thread was a clothing stores boutique that offered sweatshopfree and Fair Trade apparel, accessories and jewelry by local artisans for women, men, children and even dogs. Many items were also fashioned from organic cotton, hemp, hemp/silk, bamboo, and recycled materials, such as rubber. Their brands included American Apparel, No Sweat, Maggies Organics, Indigenous Designs, Loomstate, Edun, Manifesto, Deborah Lindquist, Amet and Sasha, Sweetskins, Namaste, Nomads, Avatar, as well as Indie Designers, local artisans, and housemade applique Peace tshirts. Prices ranged from $2 to $200, with most in the $20$80 range. On the second Friday of each month, they hosted a reception for a new art exhibit in a small gallery as part of the ArtAbout and were usually open until 9:00PM on that night. The owner was warm and friendly and visiting was always a pleasant experience.

Aquarius used to be in this location.
