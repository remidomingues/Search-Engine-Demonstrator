Nameless Magazine is a studentrun online and print publication aimed at creating and fostering a liberal arts community within the undergraduates undergraduate population at UC Davis. Founded in Spring Quarter 2007, Nameless has since expanded its publications to include quarterly online issues and yearly print publications featuring a selection of the Best Of submissions from each academic school year. The motto,  Anything That Tells a Story, reinforces the idea that Nameless is a publication for all, dedicated to letting students share their stories, whether through poetry, published authors prose or art visual arts.

The idea behind the name is that the magazine represents someone you know or would like to know â€“ Nameless seeks to break out of the mold of traditional publications, and just produce a forum for creativity that possesses all the traits of a best friend: open, fun, helpful and readily accessible.

Nameless accepts submissions from all undergraduate (and graduate) students from UC Davis. Unlike other publications, it focuses on forging relationships with writers and artists rather than simply worrying about editorial and logistical details. Nameless is first and foremost dedicated to promoting the underrepresented literary and arts community at UC Davis. Editing meetings for each board focus on compiling thorough critiques of each submission; the writer, poet, or artist will then receive a comprehensive critique along with an acceptance, rejection, or suggestion for resubmission from each editing board.

Through the support of UC Davis  UC Davis English Department English Department, Nameless offers 12 units of internship credit to students who are selected to serve as editors on each of the three editing board: Fiction Board, Poetry Board, and Mixed Media Board. Internship credit is also available for students who serve as part of the Editorial Board. Students interested in becoming more involved with the inner workings of Nameless are encouraged to apply for open positions generally available at the end of each academic year. The Ed Board consists of both the literary magazines lead editorial staff and the student organizations board members:
  President and/or Editor in Chief
  Treasurer
  Head of Public Relations
  Lead Fiction Editor
  Lead Poetry Editor
  Lead Mixed Media Editor
  Lead Web & Tech

The Editorial Board works together to ensure that Nameless functions seamlessly as both a student organization as well as a literary & arts magazine.

20071006 15:56:26 nbsp Hi!  It would be fantastic if you could upload a picture of the cover of an issue.  Also, is this an ASPAPERs publication? Users/JabberWokky

20071006 16:23:35 nbsp Nameless is in no way affiliated with ASPAPERS  its completely studentcreated, studentrun, and studentoriented. Woohoo! Thanks for fixing up the wiki page! I would love to put the current cover art, but since its an online publication it will probably just be the current issues featured art. Users/KarenM.
   Okay, I put up a shot of the site.  Really nice work... having put out a handful of zines before the whole web thing took off, I know how hard it is to get contributors and content.  You guys have done a great job here. Users/JabberWokky
