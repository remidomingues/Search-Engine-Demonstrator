Here on Davis Wiki we like to keep page name styles uniform. If youre unsure how to name a page, first check the Wiki Style Guide. If its not in the style guide, the community has probably not yet reached a consensus. Thats where this page comes in.


Should pages such as Internal Affairs Commission be renamed to ASUCD Internal Affairs Commission?  Once consensus on this matter is reached, this should likely be integrated into the Wiki Style Guide.

I dont know of any other internal affairs commissions.  The City of Davis does not have one.  I dont think the Davis Police Department does either, as I cant find any commissions on their website.  Quit going overboard with making things less centered on the university  life in Davis really is centered on the University. Users/BrentLaabs
  Your life may be centered around the University, but you do not represent the entire population of Davis.  Of the nearly 10 years Ive lived in Davis, UCD has been a part of my daily life for a sum total of 8 months.  Users/GrahamFreeman

I think its important to be specific and uniform, just as the office of external affairs is the asucd office of external affairs. To keep the name accuarte and uniform with everything else in asucd, asucd should be added. Also life in davis is not centered around  university life. 18 years of my life in Davis were not centered around university life.Users/JimSchwab

  I guess my real complaint is that since there is no other Internal Affairs Commission in Davis, I really dont want to have to type ASUCD every time I link to the page.  The page says ASUCD in the first line, so I dont think any confusion would result. I dont think we need to label Linguistics as Linguistics UC Davis Department of Linguistics and Mrak Hall as Mrak Hall Mrak Hall at UC Davis.  This is a wiki for locals, and unless theres reason to have a disambiguation page, I dont see that it helps anything. Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Users/BrentLaabs

When I saw the page listed in an index, I thought Davis PD has an internal affairs commission?  Wow, cool.  And then I found that its yet another ASUCD page that applies to a tiny subset of the UC Davis population and a very, very tiny subset of the Davis population.  If you see Mrak Hall in an index on the Davis Wiki, youre not going to think Wow, Davis PD has a Mrak Hall?  Linguistics should be Department of Linguistics or Linguistics Department, since there are undoubtedly linguists (professional and amateur) in Davis who have no UCDavis affiliation.  Users/GrahamFreeman

The way I see it is (1) The only person here confused is you.  The first line of each of these pages mentions ASUCD.  (2) An excessive number of links would need to be fixed when this changed.  (3) There are only one of these commissions in all of Davis.  Sure, there are two different Senates, but this was actually fixed.  But theres no reason to have excessively long names on every page if theres only one of them. Users/BrentLaabs
  20060209 23:59:00 nbsp 1) I just happen to be the most outspoken person on this topic.  2) I had many of those links corrected, and was working to correct the rest, when you started reverting without proper prior discussion.  3) There is no harm in making a pages association clear in the title, especially when doing so adds six characters (including the space).  There may in the future be a similarlynamed Business & Finance Commission in Davis, whether in City government, at Sac City or at CSUS (of interest to their Davis students), etc.  Users/GrahamFreeman

20060207 02:43:15 nbsp Im with Brent, especially in this rather obvious case. But even in general, the titles of UCDrelated pages dont need to reflect that, as long as its obvious from the page content that the item in question is UCDrelated. Is it really that disappointing to think momentarily that something isnt UCDrelated and then find out it is? And if you know of some group in Davis who gets together to do linguistics, by all means have at it. Users/RoyWright
  20060209 23:59:00 nbsp Roy, its not disappointing  its just an unnecessary waste of time.  Users/GrahamFreeman

20060207 12:19:22 nbsp Okay, now Brents being silly with the B&F thing. Users/RoyWright

20060207 12:26:04 nbsp I believe all ASUCD commissions should have ASUCD in their title, but separating them is unneccesary. For the wiki to expand beyond the campus, I believe titles of pages should be specific. I cannot see anything negative by adding ASUCD to the title of a few pages for claritys sake. Users/JamesSchwab

20060207 13:03:11 nbsp Similar to James, I think its the proper title and gives information to name the main entry ASUCD Foo Club.  I dont see any confusion, though, and thus think its a bit nitpicky (but we all have our own sacred nits).  I wouldnt revert a change to add ASUCD to the title, especially if theres a redirect.  Its similar to renaming businesses their proper name and having a redirect by their common name, like Abes or U Mall. Users/JabberWokky

20060207 18:53:36 nbsp This isnt really germaine, but I will say that until I actually looked at the page, I assumed that Minors referred to people under 21.  But this sort of generic ambiguity is pretty much impossible to avoid. Users/DanielBrown
  20060209 23:59:00 nbsp daniel, I had the same first impression of the Minors page.  I agree that its impossible to completely avoid ambiguity, but I dont think reasonable efforts to dispel ambiguity should be discouraged.  (Just to be clear, Im not accusing you, daniel, of doing so.) Users/GrahamFreeman
    20060212 18:42:00 nbsp No, I agreetheres no real reason why one needs to give up at all.  Its more a problem thats guaranteed to recur than anything else.  And certainly, there are UCD undergradcentric aspects to this wiki that have been intensely confusing to me as a shortterm Davis resident.  I agree with the suggestion below of making something like UCD Academic Minors page.  Oh, and theres no reason why youd know it, but Im usually a dan, not a daniel.  (My name is common enough that there was already a DanBrown.)  Users/DanielBrown

20060210 20:13:21 nbsp Should Minors be Academic Minors or UC Davis Academic Minors? Maybe Minors should be a disambiguation page pointing to Academic Minors and Minors (under 18)? Users/JasonAller

20060211 12:00:19 nbsp Good idea!  Id go with Academic Minors + the disambiguation page. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060212 16:32:30 nbsp Oh come on, despite the lack of another internal affairs commission we have to add ASUCD to it, but something completely ambiguous like the anonymous crowd doesnt get naming clarification? Users/DavisWikiGnome
   Why did you rename The Anonymous Crowd if you feel that way?  Dont be destructive to make a point. Users/PhilipNeustrom
      No seriously, I was genuinely confused about the Anonymous Crowd.  Im not trying to make a point, and I dont think it was destructive. Im not using The Anonymous Crowd as an example for the Internal Affairs debate, Im using the Internal Affairs debate as guidance for The Anonymous Crowd. Users/DavisWikiGnome
        It doesnt seem that way from what you said, namely, we have to add ASUCD to it.  Personally, I dont see anything ambiguous with The Anonymous Crowd, aside from the fact the group has the word anonymous in their band name, so it seemed to me that you were being silly and trying to make a point. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060221 01:00:26 nbsp Whats the consensus on using periods in names with initals? We have the Peter J. Shields pages with periods, and the JB Anderson pages without. Users/ArlenAbraham
