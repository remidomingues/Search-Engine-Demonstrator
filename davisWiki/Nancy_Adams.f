Nancy Adams was an elementary teacher at North Davis Elementary School from 1985 to 2006.  Prior to teaching in Davis, she taught choral music in Winters and later music and art in the San Juan school district between 1970 and 1974.  During a hiatus she taught piano and guitar lessons until she picked up teaching again at North Davis.  She was known for organizing school musicals with the 6th grade class each year, for leading the school chorus, and for guiding the composition of the school song, Like a Dolphin.  For all of this work, she was named the recipient of the 1996 Harmony in Our Lives Award.
