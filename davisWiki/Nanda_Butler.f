Nityananda Nanda Butler, a resident of Davis since his youth, died at 8:15 p.m at the age of 19 on December 3rd 1998. He was killed by a freight train near the intersection of L and 2nd streets and died of multiple traumatic injuries, the Yolo County coroners office ruled. A friend who had safely passed over the tracks immediately before Nanda died, believes he was going to wait for the train to pass, but misjudged how close he was.

No one who ever knew Nanda will ever forget him. He was a passionate, artistic spirit who brought joy to everyone around him.

20050226 21:49:38 nbsp A few years back I was sitting on a baclony in Santiago de Cuba just pondering life. A memory wandered into my head of a conversation I had had with Nanda about traveling and seeing the world. I am not a religious person, but for some reason I was thinking to myself, Nanda if youre out there give me a sign. No sooner than that thought had finished the biggest bolt of lightning hit a hill top across the bay I was admiring. Following the lightning the storm rolled in and it began to rain, a nice warm comforting rain. Users/JamesSchwab

20051115 18:46:48 nbsp Nanda was a wonderful guy, always smiling, always happy, never fearful.  I worked with him at Murder Burger the day he passed away, and I will always remember hearing that terrible news.  We had talked that day about life, having fun, music and everything else you might imagine Nanda might like to talk about.  Even though I only knew him very briefly I miss him still.  Rest in peace my brother. Users/JeffSpeckles

I recently cut a comment from this wiki as it was outrageous, slanderous and disrespectful. The comment was a serious lie about me and my son. The comment was made by Presto Baraka. I do not know Presto Baraka. Who ever wrote the comment did not leave a real name or link. So some person falsely claimed to know my son as their school teacher and then went on to write some false claims about his behavior as a child which they inferred led to his death. This comment was hurtful and blatantly rude. Have some respect for the dead and for those whose loved ones have died. I hope you can open your heart and allow compassion to come in. Jane Edberg
