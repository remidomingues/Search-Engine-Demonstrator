 Official Statement 
Hey Aggies! My name is Naomi Amaha and I am running for ASUCD Senate on the L.E.A.D state. I am 4th year student from Sacramento, CA majoring in Sociology and Communication with a minor in Political Science.  My main goal, if elected, is to help ease the cost of a higher education for students at UC Davis through realistic and achievable methods. I will work with the ASUCD book exchange to increase the availability of this resource for students as well as advocate for its relocation to a more centralized area. I also intend to continue improving ties with CalPIRG and ASUCD to collectively fight budget cuts that affect higher education and promote textbook affordability. I also plan to carry on efforts started by AAC to improve studentÂ’s access to advising services by working to update the Degree Navigation website.  I feel students have a preconceived notion about what it means to be an ASUCD senator and would like to break that mold and act a representative of this diverse student body and its needs. I am determined to show students ASUCD is an asset to this University and something worth getting involved in and believing in.  My participation in L.E.A.D has shown me that students do have the opportunity to make a change but the key is showing them how. Thank you for taking the time to learn what I am about and remember to make your voice heard and get out and vote Feb 22nd and 23rd at elections.ucdavis.edu! Vote Naomi Amaha #1 for ASUCD senate as well as the rest of the L.E.A.D slate, Andrew Bianchi, Jarvis Burston, Ravi Deepak, Dwaimy RosasRomero and Marvin Zamora.

I love this school and want everyone to have the same possiblities I have to make a difference and be involved at UCD.


Lets make history and elect the 1st transfer student ever to ASUCD Senate. Please remember to Vote in this upcoming http://elections.ucdavis.edu Winter 2006 election.
